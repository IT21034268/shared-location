1,"Updated graphics, I think not!",I was very disappointed when I received this yesterday. The graphics where horrible and the picture was very dark! My daughter lost intrest in the first 2 minutes of the game. I would not recommend this for anyone!
1,POSEURS!,"HOW COME WHEN PS2 RELEASES A GAME THAT SELLS WELL GAMECUBE HAS TO HAVE IT SO THEY CAN MAKE SOME MONEY? How come more than half of you games are on PS2? Try to release games THAT ARE YOUR OWN, NOT FOR PS2!"
1,Aweful,"this is the worst gamecube game i have played. terrible graphics, and extremely easy gameplay, make this a poor choice."
3,Addictive But Not Really Good,"Guantlet is a very addictive game once you own it, but I really have never figured out why. The graphics are poor, you need next to no intelligence to play the game, and while enemies are always coming at you in great numbers they are killed with one or two hits. Gauntlet also lacks any type of interesting plot. And the plot that does exist doesn't really fit into the gameplay at all. I guess I use Gauntlet as a game where I can vent my frustration by kiling thousands of peons. But if you are looking for a real game I would recommend one with a good storyline and more difficult enemies."
2,Incredibly Fun... for 30 minutes.,"While Gauntlet offers a lot of levels, mosnsters and bosses, it will get boring really fast. It helps to have friends playing but even then it will still wear off fast. If you don't believe me play all the way through the game, then say it's still entertaining. You almost can't do it."
1,Never Received,"I never received this game from the seller. They said that they had a ""shipping mix-up"" with the order. I didn't find out until 24 days after I ordered it that it was not going to be sent. I did receive a full refund."
1,Heartbroken Glenn Hughes Fan.,Warning!!!....Stay away from this DVD!!!As a longtime Glenn Hughes fan I was heartbroken by the quality of this DVD. The performance is great but the quality of the video was possibly inferior that of some webcasts. The video also seems to have been filmed with a time delay effect making glenn's vocals and the also the drummer's playing out of time with what we are seeing on the screen.During darker moments we are subjected to a unacceptable amount of pixelation all over the image.Glenn Hughes as an artist should never have permitted such a shoddy (Grab The Money And Run) release to have ever hit the shelves.Shame On Him!!
3,could have been great....,"Glenn Hughes makes fantastic music. However, he makes inferior DVD's.The video on this is incredibly poor. It looks like it was filmed using a video phone.The music is great but the poor quality of picture spoils the show.I am really surprized that this was released with poor video.I suggest buying the CD instead.This could have been a great concert DVD...."
4,Very good,"Good sound quality. All the Croce classics are here. If you're a ""B-side"" fan this is not for you but if you're looking for the ""best of"" then you'll be happy with this."
5,You Don't Mess Around with Jim Croce,"Okay, being in my late 30's I missed out on Jim Croce but I know his hits from the airplay they receive and I finally got this compilation album.To be to the point -this is a GREAT compilation, ranging from most of the albums he released before is unfortunate death (what is it with the greats and getting into airplanes?) I went a road trip recently and this album kept me company. I love it!There is no dating in the sound on the represented songs (except ""Operator..."" when he is calling from a phone booth and tells her to keep the dime). I listen to this album when I want to have that nostalgic feeling of a decade I was born in but didn't know that well...Get this if you call yourself a fan of music -you will not regret it."
2,Great songs but bad remastering,"I love Jim Croce's songs. The compilation of the songs on this CD are quite good. Unfortunately, the remastering is rather appalling. Guitar sounds too artificial, too much ear piercing sound. The remastering seems to have spoilt the music for me."
4,Great novelty tunes,"I guess I'm just a fan of novelty hits. I mean, I enjoy ""The Eggplant that ate Chicago!"" So, two of Croce's hits I always hear on the old folks radio are on this CD: ""You don't mess around with Jim"" and ""Bad, bad Leroy Brown"" are here for our enjoyment. There's also that time in a bottle thing that is okay once in a while. And, Croce fans will enjoy the other stuff, but the two novelties would be great candidates to download, from Amazon of course, to your personal music container."
3,"Catchy song, but obnoxious","Okay, I have to admit, ""Jenny From the Block"" is a very catchy song, and it gets stuck in my head...well, it helps that they play in on the radio and on MTV alot! However, I do think it's pretty obnoxious. All shes saying is, ""I'm a cool street girl, dont forget that, but I'm also rich and have a hollywood boyfriend."" All she wants is the street credit. This song is not something probably the average listener can relate to but I guess it's okay...if your a huge fan for some reason, buy this single...if not, just download the song, because, it's a nice song."
1,"WHY this single on BILLBOARD HOT 100 top 10, IF NOT...","Sometime I bought singles or albums depend on billboard hot chart. I bought this sigle when it hit to billboard top 10, I even hadn't heard this song once. I listen this song first ime ,just remind me ""LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE"" by MARIAH in GLITTER. And J-LO's vocal just like JANET singing ""ALL FOR YOU"" or MARIAH singing ""DON'T STOP(FUNKIN' 4 JAMAICA). l have too many like ""JENNY FORM THE BLOCK"" music product. IF this single had'nt hit to top 10, I can save the $$$."
2,"Not too bad, not too good",I tested Birding Texas under field conditions last spring. I am sorry to say that many maps are of limited use as are the descriptions to get to the places. You only need it if you like to go to places that are not covered by the two ABA/Lane guides currently available. For the Texas coast and the Rio Grande valley you'd better refer to the these two books.
4,A very good grammar,"Gothic is ""dark"" for most of people, who often ignore it has been a real language, a very important one. If Wulfila had not translated the very Bible into Gothic, we wouldn't have today any tangible hint of the existence of this early Germanic language.Wright gave us a very good grammar. Yet, Moss√©'s ""Manuel de la Langue gotique"" - which is originally in French and (I hope) has certainly been translated in English - may be a better.But anyway: you want to learn Gothic ? This grammar is clear, handy, and certainly a reference."
3,"Good, but not great!","As other reviewers have noted, this is a wonderful Field Guide with excellent photographs and descriptions. Indeed, following my first trip to Tanzania, I purchased a copy. Prior to my second trip, however, someone suggested that I take a look, instead, at Withers' Wildlife of East Africa and I was immediately sold on it.There are various reasons why I think Withers is the better choice for those going on their first safari in East Africa. Most importantly, it's a lot smaller/lighter and the descriptions are opposite the bird and animal photographs, rather than at the back of the Audubon Guide. In addition, the coverage of wildlife is excellent: we saw a lot of different animals and birds and, with very few exceptions, they were all covered in Wild Life of East Africa.A friend is off on safari this summer and asked me about what to take. They had heard of The Audubon Field Guide, but not Withers et al. It's that conversation that prompted me to write this."
2,Too difficult to read by anyone over the age of 40-45,"Pictures are great and descriptions are fine, so long as you can read them. The text is printed in a very small font and the paper is so thin you can see the type from both the back of the page and the next (or previous) page through it. If it's a matter of space, limit it to animals in Eastern & Southern Africa (where safari takers go), and leave out the extremely rare ones that travelers never get to see anyway."
4,Great field guide,"This was a great field guide with a lot of information, particularly with respect to birds. Although it was great to look up information back at the camp site or during long drives, if was difficult to quickly look up species."
2,Loud and discordant,"After hearing the exquisite playing on Charlie Haden's Nocturne,I thought for sure this album would be enjoyable ,too. Not so! Either I am not ""hip"" or progressive enough or this album stinks. Every cut seems to drift into loud dissonant passages, and the more so the longer the cut seems to get and the louder the recording engineer seems to mix it. Afraid we'll miss some of it I guess. I have heard this album compared to Bill Evans music. I don't see this at all, and I've collected Bill Evans for many years. I have nearly a dozen Haden albums and this ranks just about at the bottom."
2,Disappointing Performance,"I've had this scale for a few years now and I've just come to expect to see a different reading each time I step on the scale. I have to take a few readings and average them. Sometimes the difference between one weighing and the next is as much as four pounds.Also, the scale supposedly has a ""fat analyzer"" feature, but I was just looking at it a moment ago, and I have no idea how to activate this feature. I can set up to 10 separate users, entering age, height, sex, and ""fit level"" for each, but there's no mechanism I see for having the scale analyze anything except my weight (which it does poorly, as I mentioned).The last straw for this scale was my recent visit to my doctor's office. They had just installed a new digital scale, and according to it, my Salter was registering 15 pounds under the actual weight. Considering that there's no obvious way to adjust this digital scale, that's just too much."
5,Great Addition to your Western Library,"If stories of the Old West are part of your own library, chances are you have some of Leon Metz's books. If not, Pat Garrett is a must have for your collection."
3,Just passing time watching,"A reviewer could hardly use ""story"" as a word applying to a run of this shot.A bi-sexual Anthony mercilessly bitten and near-chopped at the beginning of a feature met his ex-boyfriend and a con-colleague-having-saved-his-life to break up with a wife of convenience and a routine stabilized, to live with.Some jerking off, some ""soft"" incest, oral sex, threesome in different combinations, some hints on S&M; in the past and future of ordinary looking, physically fit characters but none earthy deed to survive surrounding is in present depicted."
2,Flirting with Strangers,One of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Really couldn't make out the beginning nor the end. I'm sorry I purchased it.
1,Bad Porn,"What were they thinking??? I got about 5 mins into this movie and literally could not stomach watching anymore of it, though I did fast forward through it, doing spot checks with hopes of finding a redeeming quality [I did not find one]. This movie was bad across the board, a complete waste of money. The Casting was comical (I felt bad for the actors), the Acting, Direction and Overall look of the film was Terrible; it all came off as a really BAD Bisexual Porn with a Perverse Plot. TERRIBLE!!!!! To write a review I had to give it a least 1 star though it does'nt deserve one..."
3,"Great Info, Poor Workmanship","This is a must have for any fisherman, novice or experienced. It is an informative guide that is well categorized for quick and comprehensive reference. I am on my third copy because, unfortunately, the volume is not made for use on the water. The binding and pages disintegrate in the humid water environment. Otherwise, I would give it five stars. Don't even get it Wet--it dries into an impenetrable mass. My suggestion to the author is to have two volumes available. One for the home bookshelf, and one made with damp/water resistant pages (possibly spiral-bound) for on the water use. I believe that any serious angler would pay extra for this as it is an invaluable resouce."
4,Great Book Wish it was more water proof!,"This is a great and really informative book. I would highly recommend it to any Florida fishermen or women! We loved looking up and reading all the great information and really loved that in included the food value of the fish. The one and only reason it doesn't get the 5 stars for me is because as I read earlier in a review and from my own experience, this book can NOT get wet!! Mine I only had it 3 weeks and now it's unusable! It turned into a thick chuck of welded together mass of paper. So after spending nearly $20 for mine, I have nothing. But I thoroughly enjoyed reading the wealth of information it contained! And I plan to get another, but DON'T leave it in the tackle box!! Or exposed to humidity!"
4,helpful,"Up to date reference on the current most popular sport fish in Florida. The popular and available species have changed over the years. It's sad that some of the old time favorites are kind of out of the picture now, but this book helps you know which ones are in the picture if you are taking up or retaking up the sport now."
1,Don't concern yourselves with this movie...a view from a business man,"I have a girlfriend named Chichona (That is spanish for big knockers). I like to Honk things (car horns, big red noses, etc.). Therefore I purhcased this movie with its tremendously enticing title. Now I am a business man (owner of a dive bar) from a largely populated area somewhere in the U.S. I know classic movies like I know Star Trek, and I know a whole lot about Star Trek, but this is just another case of hooligans trying to tear down the thriller movie biz. Now you wouldn't hire a clown to fix a leak in the jon, so why are you allowing garbage like this to penetrate our TVs. Even chichona (that is big honkers in spanish) didn't like it. For that matter, the stinking drunks in my bar didn't like it either, and for crying out loud they were drunk!!! So the answer is no, I would never recommend this movie, I'll stick with disney, it is less violent."
1,Not a Discerning Use of Time,"I would first like to express my sincere and utmost appreciation for expending the time required to peruse my humble treatise of this cinematograph. I would ademently indispose your perlustration of this film as it is an utter and integral dissipation of your earthly allotment. I implore you to lend me a listening ear in this matter since I have been adorned with the Spirit's gift of discernment. More edifying uses of time may include employing lofty language in excessively lengthy prayers very late at night, precision cleaning sliding door runners, envisioning my future British husband, and fondelling Mr. Scott Gervais' massive biceps. And now I bid you audieu."
2,Well it is what it is,"Sadly the best thing about this book is the portability. While it has some good info, if you already know anything about camping/hiking/backpacking, then you will get nothing new from it. If however you know absolutely nothing and have a passing interest, then the book is worth it for a survey of the sport. Otherwise, pass on it, or get a more in depth book."
2,Not what I thought,"The cover and description of this book did not do justice describing how elementary and basic this book is. Copyrighted in 1996, much of this book is out of date. The ""tips"" were remedial. For example: ""Be cautious, bears can be dangerous."" Really? Are you sure? Most of the equipment illustrated was way out of date. The book itself was in good condition and the seller very helpful when I had a question. This one was my fault. I should have read between the lines before purchasing. MANY better books related to hiking."
3,A way to hike.,"If you're just beginning in this hobbie of hiking this a great inexpensive book to check out. I bought this for my dad for fathers day and he said the way the book explained and demonstrated ideas and concepts, it gave him more know how and the insight to hike at a more professional level."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This is a great movie for kids and for those who wish to relive childhood memories, as I did recently when I watched it again. It's a must-have for anyone's movie collection and should be watched around Christmastime. Everyone is sure to love it."
2,The scarey nutcracker and hideous friends,"I purchased this to show to my three year old before we went to the ballet.She was terrified and all we managed to watch together was the first 15 mins. I do not recommend this to anyone wanting to tell the story to a young child-read them a book.She loved the ballet by-the-way, once I persuaded her to go after seeing the video!"
5,The Nutcracker Prince DVD,"My wife and daughters were very excited to have this movie. It was less than $15, nor hard to find, as other sellers claimed. Beware of sellers asking more than $20 for a DVD. The law of supply and demand applies only to those who are too greedy to ask a fair price, and those who are too eager to part with their money, regardless of the item's perceived value or rarity. Remember Beanie Babies? Pokemon cards?"
5,Great video/musical. A must for the holiday season!,Terrific video/musical for young children and adults. A classic for the holdiday season that everyone should see.
4,A Textbook,"I mean, I'm not sure the feedback to be left in the process of purchasing a textbook. It arrived later than I expected, but the book itself has no flaws to speak of. It was at a reasonable price and I suppose that's all that can be said for a textbook purchase. Heyo."
2,Very Rudimentary,"This dvd is mediocre at best (in my opinion)The narrator does an effective job demonstrating each rudiment, starting slow and then increasing in speed. He is one of the monotonous individuals i have ever seen, not very dynamic and didn't hold my interest at all.This entire dvd is just the narrator/actor showcasing rudiments. Gives no pointers and nothing extra. I would pass on this dvd if i had the choice again.He did effectively show each of the rudiments...nothing more"
3,A Sloan Bishop Review,"This is the first MK game in 3D. It features a tournament mode in which it's like a real tournament, that you can control.Pros:*15 Playable charactors, many are new*Many cheat codes that are really coolCons:*The 3D isn't that impressive*The graphics aren't very good while fighting*Very hardStory:After Shao Kahn was defeated, Shinnok escapes the Netherrealm to take over the world. You must stop him at all cost."
4,MK4 Review,"I am a video game junkie, but I have never been a fan of fighting games. Street Fighter was ok. But, I will have to admit that MK4 won me over.Employing the practice mode into the game was a very smart decision. It makes one wonder why it was never done before. I am not an expert at this game, but I would recommend to use Lui Kang.I enjoyed this game so much that I am interested in buying a copy."
1,One of the Worst,"I have been a long time fan of MK, and was impressed with MK4 in the arcade. The port to PSX simply provides a poor quality game. The graphics rot compared to other fighting games, the difficulty levels are all out of whack, and the controls...forget about it. The only fun my friends and I ever get out of this game is laughing at how ridiculously bad it is. Save your money for the arcade version of this one."
5,Mortal Combat 4,It is the best game for your playstation consol ever.It is better then a ($) game.Everyone in the world would probly like it.
5,mk classics,mortal kombat its a cool fighting game i love doing scorpions spear into a throw or combo although subzeros ice can beat it
2,"Bang bang, chase chase, yawn yawn","Potentially interesting plot gets completely lost amid constant chases and bang bang shoot-outs, that reduce this to what amounts to just another boring guns, cars, and chases movie with a slight time-travel thing thrown in for the sci-fi addicts.And do films ALWAYS have to end with the two protaganists meeting for the final cliffhanging (yawn..) confrontation?Wake me up someone...."
3,THE TOMORROW MAN,THIS IS A TIME TRAVEL MOVIE AND IT IS LOW BUDGET IT COMES OFF GOOD AS CORBIN BENSON AN ABUSIVE DRUNK ABUSIVE WAYS ON HIS SON HAUNT HIM AS THE SON COMES BACK TO CHANGE HIS OWN LIFE WITCH IS VIOLENT AND DEADLY FROM THE ABUSE HE RECEIVE AS A CHILD TO CHANGE HIS LIFE AND THE ABUSIVE WAYS OF HIS FATHER WITH HAPPY ENDING.I GAVE THIS MOVIE 3 STARS.
4,Biased Review...Step right up!,"I have family involved in the making of this...so I can't be unbiased. So, it was the greatest thing since Swiss Cheese, ok? Get it?? Forget grandma's operation...You NEED this!!"
3,Keep your mate near by,"It had a good story line. However, it was very detailed (raunchy). Felt it would have still been good reading without all the sexy details."
2,"""NOT A GOOD READ""","Mary disappointed me on this book. After reading the fast-paced, interesting, drama-filled, exciting book ""Soulmates Dissipate"" the ""Never Again Once More"" was NOT a good book. It was slow and many times I thought...what is the point?I struggled to get through this book. It took me over a week to complete. I am going to continue to read the other books in the series, and hope it gets better.I'll let you know......."
2,Mixed emotions,"Well there were so many things that made me stop reading this book, then pick it up again. First off, in this one, to me it seemed like no one aged meaning Jada or Wellington. Darius was what, 20 yrs old so that had to make them in their 50's but their language and the childishness of them both seemed like the writer forgot they were older than the first book. I felt like both Jada and Wellington forgot to grow up. If someone is your soulmate then why would you marry someone else, have a baby with someone else, have sex with someone else other than that person?? This book left me confused about soulmates."
3,Never Again! A few more times.,"I have all of the books in the Jada & Wellington saga. As I read the stories I continuously shook my head at the things the characters did. I don't think Jada & Wellington knew each other well enough to be ""soulmates"". Outside of the sack, they had nothing going for them. I was highly irritated at the fact that, although they were both still madly in love with each other and never stopped sleeping together, they went off and married other people! and don't even get me started on Darius. Regardless of the horrible logic the characters used Mary Morrison's books aren't that bad and might, just might, be worth your hard-earned dollars."
4,Great Follow Up,"Never Again Once More was a satisfying read as it tale spins into the selfish, drama filled life of Ms. Jada Diamond Tanner & her offspring. Jada's corrupt motives result in raising a mannish, self centered, irresponsible nymphomaniac who learns his lesson about unprotected sex the hard way. Wellington turns out to be the knight in shining armor this go round and poor Lawrence is just something to do in the midst of Jada & Wellington sorting through their confusion. Great follow up to ""Soulmates Dissipate"" and I look forward to more sex, lies & drama in the trilogy."
3,Careful Who You Love,After reading Soul Mates Dissipate I was waiting for the sequel. I wanted Jada and Wellington to get back together.Too bad it took them twenty years. They caused so much pain to the people that loved them in the end. Neither one was my favorite
4,More and more and more...,I ordered this book before it was even published and I was not dissapointed. Mary B. Morrison did it once more! I loved the success of the charicters and the friendships in this story. I wasn't thrilled that the book went 20 years or so into the charicters lives but by the end I was o.k. with that. This story evoked much emotion and I found myself cheering for the charicters to stop waisting time and get together already. The most compelling was the ability of Jada to deal with adverse situations and with true friends at her side she was able to overcome.
4,Another Great Read,"We really enjoyed reading this book. Sister 2 Sister Bookclub has been waiting a long time for this sequel. NAOM was a delight to read. We thought at time the books was somewhat unrealistic; however, it was a quick page turner. We are anxiously awaiting the next book by Mary B. Morrison. Sister 2 Sister Book Club has definitely added this author to our list of favorites.Sister 2 Sister Book Club"
1,?!?!?! not bad....but definitely not 'great',"This book, while being nice because it was a sequel, I found to be rather lacking and not really based in reality. I don't think there was enough character development...seems to me that all the character developing was done in 'they did this, they did that' instead of actual behaviors from the characters themselves. When reading a book, I'm not very interested in the name brand clothing and material possessions they have, I like characters that I can related to on a personal level - get into sort of. I don't know any guys that would behave as ""lawrence"" in respect to the main character ""jada diamond"", but if you're into materialistic writing and the like, this book might be for you. The plot was good though."
3,Not as much umph to it as soulmates dissipate,"This book was ok. It wasn't what I thought it would be compared to soulmates dissipate. A sequal is usually better. I still don't know what Darius looks like and plus the book skipped a lot of things like births and deaths that were all of a sudden just spun upon you in the middle of the story. The next book in the sequence is ""He's just a friend"". I'm assuming this will focus more on Darius' character and not just relationships that don't last."
5,Excellent,"This book was a bit confusing at times, but I throughly enjoyed it. Ms. Morrison has really grown with her writing skills in this book."
5,Hurrah !!!,"Great game, very good graphics much better than Age of Empires, Civilization and etc. Lots of nations to choose from and a lot of missions that make it fun. Of course playing against a live opponent, instead of AI, is even better!"
2,There are much better games out there,"I recieved this game with several others. The graphics might have been good in 2003, but they are laughable in late 2005.In all fairness, I can't speak to many of this games features because I only played for about an hour, but I won't be going back to this game any time soon."
1,Really Lame!,"Labeling vigilantes' use of a windmill as a hanging platform as ""technology"" is a real stretch. Similarly, ear cropping and branding to clearly ID robbers, use of a bullwhip to punish others, and a mountain howitzer to blow down a wanted man's cabin. Sorry - there really isn't any technology involved here - just raw justice, and sometimes abuse of justice."
3,Doing Grammar,Doing Grammar arrived earlier than expected and in ok condition--which is how I bought the book. Needed the book for a college course and it is exactly what I needed.
4,Excellent Book - Almost a brief linguistic course,"The author introduces and describes the grammar from a very scholar,analytical and logical stand of view. The book is like a compact mini course of grammar. The author emphasizes the logic behind the words formations, i.e. clauses, phrases, verbs formations that makes some old fashion /ambiguous grammar terminology and rules more clear and straightforward.Although the length of the book could be a little issue, it is very readeable.I don't know if it is going to improve my gmat score (the only reason because I purchased it) but it definitely has improved my knowledge of grammar!"
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"""This grammar text makes a mess of the past perfect, e.g, ""The astrologist had predicted an earthquake in May, is an example of the past perfect"", which it's not. It's an example of putting 'had' in front of a past tense verb. The past perfect is an important tense and should not be overlooked, but you will have to go elsewhere for enlightenment. Buyer Beware"""
2,Confusing if you don't think like Morenberg.,"This grammar book appeals to a certain type of people. If you are capable of thinking exactly like the author, then this book will meet your needs. He is very abstract in his structure, which makes it difficult for me to follow, as I prefer learning in a sequential and logical order. A difficult text to use as a reference, as well."
5,Buy this if you want to know more than the parts of speech.,"*Doing Grammar* is an excellent instructional manual for anyone who already knows the basic differences between nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc., and really wants to understand how sentences are put together (and how to take them apart). Although it's presented in textbook format, with exercises at the end of each chapter, don't let that turn you off. The writing is clear and unpretentious (with a fair number of typos, however), and the learning progresses at a satisfyingly fast rate. Accessible, intelligent, and rewarding."
5,An Excellent and Practical Guide To Grammar,"I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical, ""real life"" way for me.It has helped me both as a writer and a reader.As a writer I found more options for expressing myself by having more tools to work with and as a reader it helps me decipher endlessly complex sentences that can resemble a linguistic maze.By being able to break down those complex sentences to their basic constituents, one can clearly see which parts of the sentence are functioning as core ideas, and which are functioning as embellishment.This book is very user friendly and is in my opinion an excellent self study guide with an interesting variety of exercises.Highly recommended"
4,excellent book,"A concise introduction to English Grammar.I bought it based on Shawn Berry's recommendation and read it twice. It has improved my understanding of english grammar and my GMAT score as well. Many English grammar books suffer from monstruous verbosity which Doing Grammar has none.Although the book is very concise and neatly written, I would have liked a wider scope. (e.g. idioms, prepositions)"
3,Mixed Bag.,"I've used this text 3 times with mixed results. Most students begin to catch on to, and even enjoy, the exercises. But when all is said and done, there's still some question of ""What was the point of all that?"" It doesn't help that the most recent edition contains a couple of subject-verb agreement problems in the text and that the paperback cover is one of those that immediately begins to curl up. I await the next edition."
5,Excellent text for those who are/want to be grammar nuts,"Excellent. Morenberg is hilarious, and his explanations of the complicated workings of English grammar are lucid and understandable."
4,A Truly Beginner's Dictionary,"Many dictionaries claim to contain beginner vocabulary, but include far too many words, as well as many words that are well into the intermediate and even advanced level. This dictionary contains a truly beginner's vocabulary, in volume and selection. - ESL Book Review"
3,Interesting but somewhat aimless extension to PIHKAL,"This book is the much anticipated follow up to PIHKAL, and although it does contain some interesting information, the narratives are often disjointed and whimsical. It is as though the authors said almost everything that needed to be said in PIHKAL and included this additional commentary to satisfy themselves rather than the reading audience.The chemistry section, however, is superlative, and is more than well worth the cost of the book in and of itself if you are interestd in the subject matter."
3,A mixture of new age musing and pyschedelic chemistry.,"Like Shulgin's earlier work Pihikal, Tihkal is a book of two parts. The first part is a mildly interesting semi autobiographical account of the continuing love affair of Shulgin & his partner, with new age overtones. The second part is a useful compendium of tryptamine devivatives, their structural chemistry, synthesis and their effects on very willing human volunteers.This book is an absolute must for drug chemists, and I suspect it will enjoy a wide sale to both chemists employed by enforcement agencies and those with a more direct personal interest in the effects of the compounds described.The title? It's an acronym for Tryptamines I have Known and Loved......."
3,Although I May Not Be This Book's Target Audience,"This is a very difficult read and unfortunately the technical data coupled with the authors' distaste for any usage of any other than their own specific picks turned me off. I thought, from the cover, that it may be written in a more narrative style that would interest a person like me. It seemed more like it was written to prove they were doing valid experimentation. I would like to know that, but I would like to know that in the context of a story. I really enjoy historical fiction. Martin Rots has written some very interesting and compelling fictionalized accounts of the rock scene, the counterculture and the deaths of Lennon, Hendrix, Morrison and Joplin. Did the counterculture die or was it murdered?Monterey Pop: Summer of Love (The Woodstock Trilogy)[Chicago: Days of rage (The Woodstock Trilogy)The Woodstock Conspiracy (The Woodstock Trilogy)"
5,An interesting collection,"Having taught B&F in my early 17th cent. drama class, I can recommend Wit without Money and, to some extent, The Wild-Goose Chase. I would not bother with Wife for a Month, one of the weakest and poorly written of their collaborations. Nevertheless, this is a handy book."
2,Not for persons without previous knowledge of this subject,"I am a professor of Spanish Linguistics. I used this book one semester in an undergraduate applied linguistics course and received very negative feedback from the students. In spite of the fact that the back cover claims that the book is for those with no previous knowledge of L2 acquisition research, it was definitely not accessible to my students. It lacks a clearly organized approach in explaining the history of the discipline, existing L2 acquisition theory, what motivates researchers to conduct the studies that they do, and the terminology of the discipline. I have since found that a better choice for real begginers in this area is ""Principles of Language Learning and TEaching"" by H.D. Brown (1994). Its scope includes more than L2 acquisition theory, as the title suggests, but it provides the basic understanding necessary to then begin to talk about current research."
3,"Good for Customs, Not Good for Language","I find it interesting that the glowing reviews on the back cover of the book are all in reference to the ""Simple Etiquette in Arabia"" portion (37 pages), and not to the language component (69 pages). Indeed, a traveler who relies on the stylized Roman script to facilitate reasonable pronunciation will be taking a chance.As an experiment, I enlisted the help of three colleagues to read the Arabic as presented in this book (with native Arabic speakers in the room). One produced fairly good pronunciation, the second was recognizable, and the third gave up because he was incomprehensible.The book is attractive, pleasantly thin, and enjoyable to look at. And the ""etiquette"" section is good. But to be truly valuable as a language tool, it should come with recorded material. If you plan to use it, try to find an Arabic speaker to help you with pronunciation -- before you try it on the street."
5,Handy & User Friendly,I'm in Iraq on deployment. This little book is great! Easy to carry around. It gives me pertinent phrases in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA); even though the Iraqi dialect varies.
5,Very Simple Arabic: Simple Etiquette in Arabia,Very easy book to use. Cute little figures that accompany phrases and words make this book an enjoyable and fun way to study another language.
5,Going to Saudi Arabia? then this is the book to have.,Anyone going to the Middle East and in particular Saudi Arabia needs to understand a bit of the language and the local customs. I used this book while I was living in Saudi for nine years. It is clear and concise in its organization and tells you what you need to get by be your time there short or long.
5,A PERFECT way to organize a filing project gone out of control.,"I had ignored filing for about six months. I knew I had to organize on a grand scale. This collator was the answer. With 24 slots or sections, I was able to accomplish quite alot in a short time. It closes up easily and stores in a small space. Very easy to use. Just great!"
4,I need this,"I've scanned through this book and desperately want to own it. I need a book that can help me understand how to cook anything. I'm desperate here. My skills are beyond bad. Burning chocolate pudding was bad enough two weeks ago, but now I'm burning spaghetti sauce. Last night I had to walk through the dark and throw my meal in the winter wheat field beside my house as a result. Maybe I could have salvaged the noodles by rinsing them off, but it wasn't a chance worth taking. If you've ever had burnt spaghetti sauce, you will understand how disgusting and vile it tastes. Funny how the juicy meatballs tasted fine, heh.Anyway this book does a remarkable job opening up more cooking opportunities for all the aspiring cooks out there willing and ready to learn another recipe. It's really good. I just wish I had the talent to make my meals as deliciously accurate as presented in this book."
4,A fascinating collection of airwar experience,"Personal testimonies of fighters are always very interesting, each tale gives a touch of human dimension in wars coolly and distantly narrated by freelancers or reporters. In this book there is a vivid picture of the burden to wage aerial war in Vietnam, a scar still painful in memories of those who fought it. Their stories are well worth a careful reading since they reveal the psychological attitude of the airmen and their lifestyle under the strain of action. This portrait is accurate and gripping, giving many details of how tactics, training and hardware worked under real condition (contrary to the flawless operations of a peacetime simulation). Clearly some stories are edifying experience of servicemen that went beyond the call of duty, but largely most of them resound of day to day life and of behaviour of common soldiers towards the harshness of fight. Compelling."
3,Better than the first one at least!!,"This movie was kind of dissapointing to me. It gives kids with divorced parents, or with one parent dead the TOTALLY wrong message. In this movie Chuckie gets a new mom. In real life that usually doesn't happen. I mean, just think of it, some little kid watches this movie, and then while trying to find a new parent realizes that he just isn't going to have a mom and a dad. How depressing. I do have to say some good things about this movie though. It was quite commical and Phil and Lil are very entertaining. I think it was better than the first movie, but still just wasn't very good. I reccomend another movie, like Bambi or something more realistic, haha, just kidding. I do like Bambi though, but thats just me."
1,Never got it,I never got it to work. I tried before I cancelled my purchase. But I really hope I didn't get charged for it anyway since it never worked
4,teenage daughter,My 15 year old daughter still loves this movie and asked for it for Christmas. Can't say no to the Rugrats
2,Kimi is disgusting,"She is a little poser!!! Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper, always so happy. She won't be so happy when I kick her between the legs. Also, those stupid little cowboy boots. She really sucks. I'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry. That shown her!!! The movie was good, but she stinks."
4,Kimi's kind of great,Kimi is a great charecter. But not as good as Lil. But kimi's still my second favorite charecter. It was great when she became one of the rugrats. Kimi's cute.
5,"Starring Tommy,Chuckie,Angelica,Pil,Lil,Dil and Kimi!","When Stu Pickles is summonded to work at EuroReptarland,Paris' newest amusement park, the Rugrats kids tag along. From the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame, no attraction is safe from the rugrats kids who find that fun is the same in any language. Meanwhile, love is in the air for Chuckie's dad, Chas. Could Chuckie be getting a new mom? The Rugrtas kids learn valuable leson in courage,loyalty, and true love in this music-filled journey featuring the hit song,""Who Let the dogs out?"", and the voice talents of Susan Sarandon and John Lithgow. Rugrats in Paris is sure to warm your heart as it tickles your funny bone!"
5,Love it,"When I was young, I always loved watching Rugrats. And out of the movies that were made, this one was by far my favorite one! It's one of my favorite things from my childhood! I would recommend this to anybody who has children or even an adult that may enjoy getting back in touch with the kid in them!"
5,AWESOME,i bought this for my nephew who is recently into rugrats and he and his brother both watched it over and over again. i loved rugrats growing up and im so glad that i get to watch it again with my nephews. i also bought rugrats the movie and rugrats go wild
4,Way better than the 1st one!!!,"The first one was unbarible. The second one was 10000000 times better. This one did have more plot ect. This one showed more excitment with crude humor and all. In america this should be rated PG for Violence, Crude humor, and 'some material may not be sutible for childeren'. Overall this was way better than the first one"
5,A Merry Christmas Dress,I have 3 girls and they looked beautiful in their matching dresses for Christmas!! I have washed them since then and they held up wonderfully!
5,THE BEST NEW DANCE MUSIC OF THE MILLENIUM!,"You're A Superstar, is just one of the many get hits of Love Inc.'s self titled Canadian debut album. Other songs such as Broken Bones, Homeless, and Why Don't You Take Me, are also trippy hits that you NEED to listen to! It will change your type of listening! So I suggest to all of you who don't have their self titled album, go out and buy it (released 1998), it's one of the GREATEST Dance Collections you'll ever listen to!"
4,Good CD. Worth adding to your collection.,This is a good CD--especially when mixed with vocals from other artists. This is a worthwhile addition to a CD collection.
4,A Great First CD,"Elliott Yamin's new CD is a great new summer release.His easy going, melodic melodies prove why he ended up on American Idol.This CD is perfect for long car rides with the top down this summer. Yamin's soulful and inspired sounds make life easier and less stressful.His selection of songs highlight his talent and his range as a artist. I particulary liked track 9. This song makes a great dancing tune and the whole CD just sparkles.I'm looking forward to his next so I can add it to my collections"
5,One word: Amazing!,"Like the song, Amazing; this album is just wonderful. Don't expect songs like American Idol -- this is the real deal. A relaxing mix of R & B feeling, some up-tempo and love ballads. I have had this CD for 3 years and it gets played all the time. Recommend strongly as a must-buy."
4,The most soulful Idol yet,"Elliot Yamin is one of the more interesting of the American Idol finalists as he is nearly deaf, but can sing very soulfully, and this album shows it. His current hit ""Wait For You"" is an example of how his voice can project a rhythm 'n blues texture. His rendition of the jazz standard ""A Song For You"" is very expressive that it cannot compare with others. This is an album you can't do without."
3,Stevie?,"Let me preface this with the comment that I love Elliott. On the other hand, I am not a huge Stevie Wonder fan. And a lot of this CD sounds like Stevie. There are a few tracks I adore: 5, 6, 7 and 10. And 11 is a nice remake. I think his next CD will be amazing because he definitely has the talent."
3,I know he can do better,"There are a few songs on this album that are very good, enjoyable to hear over and over and live (he does a dynamic live show) - but then there are some that are utterly ho-hum and dull. I'd say it's 40/60 in favor of ho-hum...but I love his voice and know that there has to be someone out there who can produce this stellar talent well. Will keep waiting, worth having for those few really good tunes, the others fade away."
3,Not up to hopes,"I was realy excited to get this cd, as I felt Elliott should have won American Idol. However, I don't think the songs were well chosen to showcase his talent and many of the songs arrangements overshadowed his dynamic vocal capabilities. I have listened to it twice and not been tempted to listen again."
2,Good Effort,"So him and thought he had good vocals. Really disappointed in his first album. Only 2 good tracks that I like. Hey, each to his own."
3,An ok first album.,"I really like the first song ""Movin On"". Elliott has a phenominal voice. Would have liked to have heard some songs similiar to the ones he sang on American Idol."
3,ORIGINAL,HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE RELEASE OF A CD FOR THE FANTASTIC MR. YAMIN. THAT VOICE - WOW. GOOD LISTENING - BUT WISH HE'D SUNG A FEW MORE UP TEMPO COMMERCIAL SOUL TYPE SONGS TO BALANCE THE CD. HAVING SAID THAT - LOVE THE VOICE. HE'S A STAR.
4,"I love Elliott, but.....","I'm a HUGE Elliott fan and eagerly awaited this CD, but I was a little disappointed in it. Only 1 or 2 songs really stand out, most of them sound very much alike (same background music style and rhythm). I was hoping there'd be a couple acoustic songs (besides Song for You, which we already know) that would really show off his magnificent voice! He sounds great as usual, I just hoped there'd be more variety in the songs."
5,Best CD This Year!,Great CD! Best one I've gotten so far this year! First album in a long time I could actually listen all the way through--none of the tracks bored me.
3,More Up to Mid-Tempo Songs Please!,"I don't watch American Idol! I saw Elliot Yamin's music video on VH-1 and I thought ""The music industry is getting flexible with people who are a bit older, who is this guy singing such a great song?"" Ha! Soon after I found out that he was on American Idol and that he is really young. Anyway, I decided to get the c.d. since it was such a great price. Elliot Yamin has a fantastic voice and for his first full-length project an awesome c.d. . The only disappointment was that I feel that there are too many ballads. You can tell that one of his main influences is the great Donny Hathaway. And if you really want to hear that influence check out Donny's Daughter, Layla. Elliot Yamin has a bright future...just like that other guy, Chris Daughtry. I hate that phrase ""blue-eyed soul"", Elliot Yamin is a soul singer!"
2,Excellent Singer - Weak CD,I was very disappointed in this CD. The song choices were poor and the vocals were weak. I could not even add it to the CD's played in my car.
4,Great album,"I watch Idol almost every season and this has been the first contestant that I swore to support once they received a recording contract. I was so proud of Elliott on the show and became a huge fan. The album sounds great! I love his voice. I especially like the fact that you can't tell anything about his outward appearance, by listening to his voice. I think a lot of R&B fans will be pleasantly surprised. This is one of those albums that I like to ""sneak"" in on other R&B fans. Once you hear his voice you will be won over and then when you see the cover--you're like ""What?? No way!"". And I say, ""Aha, fooled you, didn't he?"". Best of luck to Elliott in the future."
3,Half Good - Half Bad,"The first 4-5 songs on the CD are really good. Elliot's voice is strong and he delivers these tracks will skill, especially Tracks 1 and 2. But the rest of the CD sounds too much alike. They all kind of blend together and they aren't distinctive."
2,"Talented guy, but these songs don't show it.","Yamin has a wonderful voice, there is no denying that. Unfortunately, this album does little more than to showcase it in songs that are forgotten almost as soon as they end. And unless his next effort is head and shoulders above this one, I'm afraid his career will follow suit.As stated, Elliott can definitely sing. What he really needs, however, is a REAL band, playing well-crafted songs with hooks-a-plenty and then and only then, will he truly be on to something.Here's hoping that happens as he, and his loyal fans, deserve much better."
1,Download a song instead....,"I love his song ""wait for you"" I was very excited to get his CD. I thought the sound quality was good. I found the rest of the song choices disappointing. Save your money and download the song you like."
2,Weak,Disappointing poppish sound. Like Elliot doing more Bob Dylan/Van Morisson style with more soul.
3,A bit disappointing...,"I, being a huge fan of American Idol, looked forward to the release of Elliot's first album for months. I loved his style and satiny-smooth delivery. He had a great tone. Unfortunately, much of his former appeal has been lost in this release. The style is too hip-hop for his vocal style. He needs to slow it down and let himself soar."
1,Disappointing...,I expected a lot more from Elliott on this CD. The production quality is very low on almost every song and the only ones likely to be played on the radio sound like songs the Backstreet Boys threw away 10 years ago. He should have just stuck with soul and not tried to be mainstream because it doesn't work for me. I'm looking forward to his next record.
2,Mixed bag,"Elliott's singing is excellent as always and it is the reason that I bought this CD. The melodies are mostly mediocre and the arrangements are low-budget cheesy grooves like from a Casio electronic keyboard. The fake clapping mixed up so high just drives me nuts. Luckily there are a few songs that don't fit this description.The production and melody quality are what kill this CD. It's certainly not Elliott as he really sang his heart out on every track. Hopefully the next time he can get better support, better production, etc. and then he can have a real winner!"
4,"Beautiful, but was hoping for R&B","Elliott's voice is beautiful; he sounds almost identical to Stevie Wonder on some tracks. Love him, but this CD is too boy-bandish for my taste. I'll look forward to purchasing his next CD and hope he changes his style a bit."
5,True Soul,I never thought I'd hear someone do R&B Soul music so well again. I was searching for wedding music and decided that I'd listen to the samples of this album. I immediately loved it and purchased the album. I will definitely be on the lookout for more of Mr. Yamin's work.
5,Elliot Yamin,Elliott is a winner! Great songs and I love his style of singing....jazzy.....and I could understand every word he is singing!
5,An Unexpected Surprise! An Amazing Album!,"I enjoyed watching Elliott sing on American Idol. He was an unexpected talent in a generic field. WHen the CD was released..I didn't buy it right away. But when I finally did...I left it in my CD player for three months. Awesome, Amazing, Fantastic and a true joy to listen to. I am a huge fan now and will look forward to more of his releases. Well done!"
3,Smooth listening!,"Very well done. Not as good as Daughtry's, but darn close. His sound is smooth and jazzy. Definitely good riding in the country music!"
5,Excellent Debut...,"Literally the first and only American Idol contestant that I actually picked up the phone and voted for. Hands down the best voice of the season yet snubbed for not having that ""X-Factor"" that Fox was looking for. Elliott's debut CD is quite impressive with several tracks destined for top 10; one my personal faves being ""Wait For You."" With Sony/ATV Music's backing, it's obvious THEY as well as millions of fans out their saw something in Elliott that AI didn't. That being said, P2P wasn't even an option & I happily shelled out the cash to support Elliott's career."
2,"I Love Elliott, but this CD is seriously lacking ...","This CD is a tremendous disappointment. I anxiously anticipated the release of this CD, but now wonder what happened ... Most all of the songs sound the same and they are somewhat boring. There is very little life to any of these songs.I think Elliott is an amazing singer, but this CD doesn't showcase his tremendous talents at all. Nothing would make me happier than to tell you this music is wonderful -- but it simply isn't. Maybe the CD will grow on me -- I can only hope.Compare this with Chris Daughtry's first CD and you will see the difference (The Daughtry CD is amazing)."
2,Very disappointed,"I agree with some of the reviews that this Elliott's debut is a disappointment. Elliott has a strong, soulful r&b voice, which in this cd, saddled with a very cliche neo soul sound. This almost sounds like a male version of Katharine McPhee cd. Forgettable, no personality. A Song For You is one of the few good ones."
3,"Okay, not fabulous.","Elliott was my favorite American Idol contestant the season he competed; I really enjoyed watching and listening to his performances (snaggly teeth or not!). There's something missing from this CD -- the watching part. He's certainly not the best-looking man (sorry Elliott), but he didn't just sing a song, he lived the song and convinced me he meant every word. As just a listener, I'm less involved in the music than I was when I could see him perform. I decided to buy this CD after his performance on this season's American Idol elimination night; his mom had recently passed away and my way of mourning his loss was to buy his music. If he releases a music DVD, I will buy it."
4,A great soulful experience.,"If you were a fan of Elliott Yamin on American Idol, than you'll love this CD. His jazzy soulful quality definitely shines through!! A very good listen!! Cheers, Kelly Cabral"
5,AMAZING!,"This album is everything I expected and more! Elliott shines on songs ""Free"" Alright"" and ""Wait For You"". All the songs have a r&b edge to them. It was worth every penny! This album proves that Elliott should have been crowned American Idol 2006, and not Taylor Hicks, sorry Taylor fans. Just my opinon."
3,Not Quite Idol Material,"I loved Elliott during the show and I absolutely felt he was the best singer of the three finalists, so though I liked Taylor Hicks, I was disappointed Mr. Yamin went home. This album doesn't quite capture the full range of Elliott that we got to witness as he blossomed all season. There are a few highlights like Movin' On and Trainwreck. But Song for You is not nearly as intriguing and captivating as his on-stage version and I'm simply under-whelmed by the whole production. I really like you, Elliott, but your CD was a one-listen album for me and now it's just in the CD changer with the other 500+. Unlike the Killers and Carrie Underwood who stayed in the car for weeks, you didn't allure me to want more. Sorry."
3,LOVE HIS VOICE...did not care for the songs much,"I am a HUGE E fan...so I was thrilled to get my copy of his debut CD.His voice is 100% amazing..but the songs were less than interesting. I did enjoy 'Alright' and 'A Song for You' but the others are not well written and quite honestly, all sound the same.I realize I am NOT the target demographic for this CD..but bad songs are bad songs.I DO this 'Wait for You' will be a hit ..maybe that will give E the chance to make a BETTER CD next time around.As Paula, Randy and Simon used to tell you E...""You have to choose the right song."" I think the boat was missed on that.YOU VOICE IS GOLDEN though..golden!!"
3,Its OK...,I really felt that Elliot was the best vocalist on the show two seasons ago and was eager to receive his first CD. He shows that he is still a great vocalist! However...The music he chose sounds like a stereotypical Boy-Band selection. I just finished listening to the entire CD and not one song sticks out. The clapping percussion on many of the songs got to be very annoying and I didn't feel that any of the songs really sent chills down my spine. Final thought... I was a bit disappointed and I will have to hear the next one before I commit my money.
1,Poor Disapointment.,Not as expected. CD quality was good the singer and song choices were disapointing.
5,Extraordinary!,"This has to be one of my favorite cds ever, in particular ""You are the One"". I love that song. It is such a beautiful and uplifting love song.""You're the star who lights up my skyYou're the one who made me seeThat you don't need wings to flyYour love has set me free""I was a lukewarm Elliott fan during Idol, but this CD has turned me diehard. What a strong debut! I can only hope many more are to come!""Cause you are the one who makes me wholeIn my heart and in my souldJust like the sun you showed me the lightI'm amazed and you're the reason why""I <3 you, Elliott!"
3,Good First Album from an Exceptional Singer/entertainer,"I felt that this album was typical to new albums by AI artists. However, Elliot has the chops to have staying power and a long career, IF he gets a better produced album.A comment posted, was that a lot of the songs sound the same or similar. That is a production issue. Not putting in a different variety of songs, choosing songs with different tempos, stylings, etc. It's really not Elliot. But he does need to get more involved with his album.This issue was the same thing hampering Taylor Hicks album. The guys are talented, they just need a bit more variety.If you like Elliot Yamin - you'll enjoy the album.If you like R&B; - you'll enjoy the album.Just remember it is a debut cd, and hopefully going forward we'll see more originallity and variety in the song selections. (Jewel also had this problem on her first album as well)."
5,A must buy!!!,"Elliott Yamin is proof that you don't need to be an actual AI ""winner"" to be a WINNER! I am honestly and terribly picky when it comes to buying new cds as one has to pass my test first (need to be an actual singer-songwriter, have a strong voice, yada yada yada) and I am also a ""late to the game"" Elliott Fan but MAN! is this man AWESOME! Soulful, heartfelt, he is the real deal and he deserves every bit of recognition he gets! Go out and BUY HIS CD - you will NOT be disappointed!!!"
2,Get WORMS ARMEGGEDON!,"This game is great an all, I've played it since i was a kid, butWORMS ARMEGGEDON has more weapons and is more fun in my opinion"
2,Worked. Not great.,With RV water pressures being low on DC pump use this does not work that well. I will keep it as a backup. I recommend the narrow adjustable jet sprayers or less spray holes for DC voltage pump use.
2,Late,This book took forever to get. I didn't recieve it for a month! Emailed and recieved no responce.
5,Best Album Ever!,"This is, by far, one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. The songs are very catchy and most of them are very upbeat. The whole album creates a mood ideal for imagining sci-fi universes and maintains great energy throughout. I managed to get my hands on the special edition copy with remixes of all the songs and the remixes (except the Caustic remix) blew me away even harder than the Harsh Generation album! This is an all-time favorite for me, and after months of listening to it with other artists I still find myself enjoying every song on this album. It'll get old after you've listened to it for a week straight, but then it'll keep coming back like a drug addiction throughout the many months ahead. Grendel's creativity and musical genius is worth every last penny spent on this album! Truly amazing!"
2,Not the best,"Grendel's previous album, ""Prescription:Medicide,"" sounded like an overly-distorted Embryodead-era Wumpscut (if you don't believe me, go back and listen to track 1, ""Construct Constriction,"" and then go and listen to the title track of Embryodead. Hear it now? Good). After the noteworthy ""Soilbleed"" EP, they have now progressed to...bland, uninteresting harsh EBM. It's not that anything about the album is particularly bad, but rather that it doesn't really stand out with any sound of its own. The synth lines are reminiscent of a dozen bands and just about every recent club-friendly release. The vocals are also the stereotypical distorted scream/sing/speak that gets tiresome by track 2. The programming is just varied enough to guarantee that a human being was involved in the creative aspect at some point, but not interesting enough to merit any serious attention. Great filler music but otherwise wholly unremarkable."
5,Learn the Cyrillic Alphabet and Proceed!,"Once you learn the alphabet (no small feat) you'll have fun with this book. And, you'll UNDERSTAND why Russian-speakers have difficulty learning perfect English (and that will be an epiphany).So, in all circumstances, try this book out. Knowledge of another language that has gender cases for nouns (such as German) is helpful, because you have already jumped that hoop. Get ready to encounter a language with no real prepositional phrases, definite articles (""the""), and no particular concern about word order. However, it can be fun, and will give you some great insights into one of the world's great and most spoken languages. All thanks to St. Cyril, who wanted to invent an alphabet that took the best from the available ones. He missed on a few points, and those are worth discovering too!One of the best free-standing Russian language books I have uncovered."
4,"A good ""starter"" book...","Because this is labeled as an ""Idiot's Guide"" does not mean that you can sprint through the book. The focus is mainly on spoken Russian - how to communicate. It's a good overview of the language, teaches a broad range of vocabulary, gives a decent but not exhaustive explanation of grammar and pronounciation, and keeps it all interesting and fun. Each section stands on it's own, so you can skip around without getting totally lost."
2,A good approach but filled with errors.,"There are too many errors in this edition to recommend it to a beginner. Approximately 75 errors were encountered. For a second edition, it is surprising that these errors were not corrected. Otherwise, I think this book would have been a good introduction to the Russian language."
1,disc missing,"I purchased this with the the practice CD, hour long listen and learn, as specified on the cover. The CD is missing."
3,"Good concept, but too many errors","I like the author's basic and well conceived approach, which is apparent from the start with the way he teaches the Russian alphabet. However, there are many typos and errors which are confusing to learners. Russian words have accent markers on one syllable, but then the English transliteration has a different syllable emphasized, so you don't know which pronunciation is correct. Also, sometimes the transliterations are incorrect (often confusing letters which appear similar in English and Russian, such as P and H. Finally, there are other errors such as giving July 4th as the Russian Victory Day, awkward switches between Celcius and Farenheight temperatures, and actual mistranslations such as ignoring the Russian ""ne"" (not).If this book were to be corrected I would give it four stars instead of three."
1,Inexcusably bad quality control,"This is a second edition and it still has errors that are obvious even to an novice like myself. A book like this should been proofread by a native speaker. Even looking past the mistakes, there's not a lot of substance here either."
5,A Novel This Good Is A Challenge Some Readers May Fail,"Some novels are so good and so diverse, work on so many levels, and come together at last with such satisfying originality that many readers may find themselves lacking the skills to stay with the ride. Ugly, obscene, beautiful, innocent, trivial at times, almost cosmic, this book will reward the reader who is not afraid of a new literary experience. Brad Watson is like a Southern Thornton Wilder but without Wilder's New England primness and need to tie everything up into a neat package. The town of Mercury, Mississippi, with all its warts and loveliness, its living, its dead, come alive and will live forever in the pages of this extraordinary novel."
3,Not Exactly Heavenly,"Nicely crafted, but ultimately unsatisfying. The themes are substantial - sex, death, racism, longing, opportunity lost - and Brad Watson strikes a rich vein when exploring the porous threshold between the living and the dead, but the characters never come to life and the writing style often is too light to support the rich, dark subject matter."
1,What's are the reviewers seeing that I'm missing?,"Larry Brown, the book jacket ""blurb"" reviewer, claims that this book reminds him of Faulkner and Garcia Marquez. Huh? The comparison defames both writers, as this is a highly forgettable book without much passion, direction, or distinction. It is one of those books that tries so hard to be special that you can see through the attempt, and the effort ends up looking sad ..."
2,"Great prose, but where's the story?","This guy can write -- if only he could learn the rules of novel writing: conflict, climax, resolution. There's none of that here. What we get instead is a sequence of gorgeously written character studies, with no real story tying them together. Finus, the main character, is an utterly dull and plodding creature, in love with a woman Birdie Wells, who herself isn't very strongly developed. What's so great about her?"
3,Lord have mercy! Req'd viewing for Duchovny fans.,"Story isn't the greatest although it's OK. At least the dialogue was reasonably interesting and not just the usual junk. But let's not kid around, the attraction is Duchovny. Very very sexy performance (except for when he's being a snake). If Mulder makes you sweat, this movie is not to be missed. Favorite part: during the phone conversation that comprises the first 1/2 of the movie, Duchovny is on his bed, on his back, listening to a sort of sexy story. As he silently listens, he slowly tucks just half his hand into the waistband of his pants. Oh man. He makes me sweat."
4,If you love David Duchovny this movie is a must-see!,"Fans of David Duchovny must check this movie out! His portrayal of a womanizing, less-than-honest hunk who calls women up randomly and pursues a one night stand is outrageously funny! And sexy! In the tradition of Duchovny's other sexy role in Red Shoe Diaries, this movie is definitely hot! The plot may be lacking, but when you have David Duchovny running around shirtless, WHO CARES? Definitely one to watch more than once, but for diehard Duchovny fans only!"
4,Loved it enough to buy another copy!,"I bought this movie years ago when I did a search and found out David Duchovny (Mulder from X-Files) was in it. It shouldn't spoil the plot to tell you a big part of the movie involves a long phone conversation with ""Julia"" (an actress I hadn't seen before and haven't seen after) and Duchovny's character. This is not Mulder. He was adorable, funny, charming, and he made the movie for me. Daphna Kastern was good in the role, but not a stand-out. I'm not such a fanatic that I love all Duchovny movies, so believe me when I tell you this is a winner. I lost my original copy and am buying it again, which should tell you something. If I had to categorize it, it's probably in the romantic comedy genre. I subtracted one star in case you're not a Duchovny fan. If you are, though, you must get this! thanks, adrian"
5,What a sweet book!,"My 6-month-old daughter loves this book and I love to read it to her! My daughter just stares and stares at the pictures of animals and their babies, and I love the sweet rhymes. And two books in one--what a deal! This is one of my favorites to give as baby gifts."
4,"A good album, but with certain flaws as most live albums have","The album starts off with a bang, but the sound quality gets a little muddy at times.Most of the bands hits are played with some extended jams that work with energy and strength.Some songs don't measure up to their studio funk albums but lacks a certain polish.Tower of Power is a great band who seemed to hit the vein of funk, but at times lose findinga great song."
2,Not their best effort,"Not one of their better efforts. I was born and raised in Oakland, and this does not have the grit that I have come to enjoy from this band. T.O.P. is one of my favorites bands. I have seen them a few times, and only one time I have walked away disappointed, That was because I had lost my way, and didn't keep up with band, and now I am back. This onw leaves much to be desired"
5,this cd has kick!,"It's a shame we don't have a DVD to go along with this live recording, done back in '98 at the Fillmore. The audio is superb; somebody did a fine job mixing everything. Anybody who wants a lesson in syncopation should listen to this, especially 'What is Hip'. There is a tremendous rendition of an old TOP standard, 'Willing to Learn'. If the singing & horn playing don't move with this song nothing will. The way the bass drum punches with the horns is just great. Enjoy!"
5,You got to groove.,"This is the absolute best album by the absolute best funky soul band ever. Combine fabulous songs, old and new, with incredible musicianship and great mastering. Beware: the bass is so rich on this cd you may have trouble hearing it on cheap equipment. You haven't heard soul until you've heard this album. Crank up the speakers and get ready to scrape the cat off the ceiling."
5,DA' BOMB,"Finally, a CD that captures the power that is Tower of Power live. Magnificently recorded and engineered. It is as good as being at the club.Fresh arrangements of classic material.You'll be funky like a bow legged monkey.If you like tight horn based souled, go get it with your good credit!!"
5,AWESOME...SIMPLY AWESOME,The best Tower of Power record...with David Garibaldi again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Best Soul Horns In the World....Bar None!,"Great lead vocals with SOUL that are as good or better than the Lenny Williams days. The TOP horn section is so precise and experienced, it is truly a joy to hear them perform live. I have loved R&B soul music all my life, but the this CD really captures its essence like no other recording.If you can listen to this and remain still, you're dead!"
4,"Great, until the last dozen pages","Edward Westcott (himself a banker in upstate New York in the latter part of the 19th century) wrote only one book, but he didn't live long enough to see it published in 1898. The book, ""Daivd Harum,""introduces a very interesting country banker with crackerbarrel philosophy which became a wonderful character for Will Rogers in the movie of the same name. There are some terrific vignettes in this book, the Christmas one alone would make a wonderful annual TV special. Conversations between the principals sparkle with good humor and much heart. The only problem I had with the book is the two unlikely coincidences at the end of the tale. It's like the author didn't know how to resolve the issue, so he created impossible chance meetings. Not one, but two of them. However, up until this point, the book is as good as any I have read. I would suggest that you try and find it and enjoy it for yourself."
4,PK Dick in Living Color,"Hmmmm... so this is the comic of a movie of a book? Actually it works pretty well, bringing together Philip K. Dick's strange story of narcotic paranoia with Richard Linkletter's unique cinematic vision. A federal agent (or is he?) must discover who is flooding the streets with the dangerous drug Substance D. We follow a bumbling band of hallucinating addicts and morally bankrupt agents that are chasing them in one of Dick's darkest and most autobiographical tales. The artwork is well drawn using vivid colors to enhance the story. Fans of comics or of quirky tales will find a lot to enjoy here."
3,Good...but what's with the editing?,"Having caught a second wind, Perry continues what she started in Seven Dials by taking familiar characters to new and exciting places (psychologically speaking.) She's really revitalized the series. However, I wonder if she's switched editors with this one, and for the worse. I noticed a large number of typos and either clunky or downright erroneous wordings that never existed in the previous Pitt novels. It was distracting enough for me to knock one star off my review."
4,Strange bedfellows,"Thomas Pitt is invited to Long Spoon Lane just before anarchists release bombs in the neighborhood. Two of the anarchists are arrested and the body of the son of a wealthy Lord is discovered. Thomas is distressed to learn that the anarchists may be involved with crooked police who are extorting money from businesses in the neighborhood. He finds himself allied with Charles Voisey, an old enemy who promises to help him find the guilty parties and to oppose an act of Parliament which would give guns to policemen. The plot slows down in the middle of the book, but begins moving more rapidly towards the end as author Perry weaves an intricate web of deceit in which no one knows who is a friend and who is an enemy. She also paints a wonderful background of Victorian England in which the reader is treated to sights, sounds, and smells which bring that era alive."
3,Not my favorite Anne Perry book,"I usually love Anne Perry Books. I eat them up as she turns them out no matter which series is published, but I couldn't wait to finish this one. It just wasn't interesting. The usual historical data was prevelant, but the mystery itself left something to be desired. Kind of boring and I was glad to be finished so that I could move on to the next book."
3,Bugged by Tellman,"This intricate novel with its bombings and Parliamentary debates about increased police power have obvious echoes of our own time. (Patriot Act, anyone?). I liked the theme of Pitt's having to cooperate with archenemy Voisey, but Thomas comes perilously close to James Bond territory in his miraculous escape. What bothered me was Tellman. In the previous book he was Inspector; now he is Sergeant. Did Wetron bust him or is this just sloppy editing? Inquiring minds want to know. And I couldn't believe Wetron trusted him as far as he did Still, an absorbing read."
4,Must read for Texas lovers,"Mrs. Richards tells her story up through her two terms as Treasuerer of Texas with candor, common-sense and a clear love of Texas. The writing is not the best - she is prone to introducing people and then not saying why she introduced them - but her tale of accomplishing amazing things simply building on her love of politics, family and Texas is inspiring. I was left with the feeling that I too could be a player wherever I hung my hat. While the book may have been written in part to help her to the Governorship, Mrs. Richards is candid about her motivations, weaknesses and political evolution. This book made me glad I live in Texas and sorry that Mrs. Richards is no longer our Governor."
5,He's a great writer and teacher,"Simply put, Marovic is one of the best chess writers. He is a GM but knows how to communicate chess to you. All of his books are a joy to study. This book, along with his work, Play the Queen's Gambit, somehow seem to get a lot of use by me, while other more famous books go untouched. Marovic writes with passion, but not in an unbridled manner. He is always a perfect blend of intensity, variations, text, and enthusiasm. This book on the King's Indian is great. I love these Pergamon books from the '80. They were beautifully produced, they had sections covering variations, and each chapter had several illustrative games, and there is a nice index at the back. Sounds simple, right? Then why can't EVERYMAN books do it? Why can't GAMBIT do it? This is a great book, a perfect chess openings book."
3,Fridge - The Sun,"Fridge returns with _The Sun_, another foray into the complexities of post-rock. So even while the title track sounds skeletal -- percussion, flute and feedback -- it segues into the more melodic ""Clocks"" and the understated ""Our Place in This."" The drum machine, piano chords and electronic squeal of ""Comets"" propels us into outer space, but in the overall album, something seems to be missing. Sure, the country twang of ""Years and Years and Years..."" is lovely, but the same sense of discovering beauty and sustaining it just doesn't seem to be there. Maybe it just got momentarily hidden by the sun."
5,Great Acoustic Blues,"An excellent album by a virtuoso guitarist and master raconteur. Roy Book Binder is one of the best blues musicians playing today. His live performances are outstanding, and this CD is an excellent introduction to his work. It also features a guest appearance by Jorma Kaukonen (of Hot Tuna and Jefferson Airplane)."
2,Pet leash not very strong,My dog is 16 months old and weighs 13 pounds. Unit is flimsy and the retractable devise is weak. You sometimes get what you pay for.
1,non-christians beware!,"I would have given this book no stars, but that's not an option in the review program. I am returning this book to Amazon. The 'research' base for this book is clergy and committed christians. I didn't get that information from the info on Amazon. The book is not scientific. Unscientific 'facts' are presented such as- early puberty is caused by exposure to TV and sexual situations presented there. NO science, data base composed completely of christian men very involved with the church and a rip off to men who really want to know what is going on with them."
4,Good!,"A book that explains all the sensations that race through a man's mind when he is at his sexual peak, the problems, the successes and the goals. Very good for the teenager or for the curious adult male, but not very helpful when dealing with sexual disorders and treatments. For that I recommend ""Natural Penis Enlargement: New methods of avoiding and curing impotence, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction safely and inexpensively. NEW Secrets that your doctor won't tell you, No Pumps, No Pills and No Gadgets!"" by Platinum Millennium, a book that helped me regain my sexual vitality"
2,It was not interesting.,"I read a little bit of it but what I read I did not find interesting.I was not what I expected,but it might help some people."
5,Where to find on DVD,"Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit. She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father. If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD, look for it under the titles Bride of Violence 1 & Bride of Violence 2. It has only been released full length on DVD in the Netherlands under the alternate title. Keep in mind that this is a region 2 DVD (PAL) and will only play on a region 2 dvd player or a multi-region dvd player. I got one here on amazon for less than $40."
2,Oh well...,"The video was in good shape and it arrived promptly. However, the box was not the one I saw in the picture, and the movie was not the 4 hour TV version I hoped for. The version is not the seller's fault, of course."
5,Improvisation at its best,A superb compilation of some of the best Parker's performances. Delightful mastery. The strings add to a completely fresh and soft atmosphere. This is a Parker everybody should know about.
5,"""A TRUE MASTER""","BIRD ( CHARLIE PARKER..W/ STRINGS) IS...""GREAT MUSIC"" ... Bird was (and is ) one of the most influencial musicans to ever walk the planet."
4,Good release....,I've always liked certain tunes from Mr. Parker with strings and I finally broke down and made the purchase. I thought there would be outtakes (aka other takes or versions of the same songs) but there weren't. A classic for any jazz fan. Buy it if you haven't already got it in your collection.
4,"Not crazy about the strings, but..","...is Charlie Parker, and that is enough. I guess he could have had a Mariachi backing him up, and still the whole thing would have sounded great. The arragnments are a little bit chessy sometimes, but is Parker solo that really makes it all worth. His version of Summertime is just mind blowing. They cant take that away from me and stella by starlight are also higlights. Oh, and by the way, 25% of this CD is live, recorded at the Carnegie Hall."
2,Good Idea- bad execution,"I had been wanting this collection for quite awhile, thought a strings backing would be interesting, a nice juxtaposition...This recording is barely listenable...the string arrangements are pretentious, overwrought, and what one would imagine hearing in a 1940's/50's hollywood melodrama fraught with a bad script and acting.....It coulda worked if the string arrangements had been subtle, straight background for some decent pop tunes...this is really bad. Because Bird's playing is great, someone ought to rerecord the background..."
2,This is the one,"to get if you don't really want to hear what Bird was all about but want to have something in your collection by him. That's what this record was designed to do, reach the larger white audience with no real interest in Jazz. 2 stars for Bird managing to make something at least palatable out of Hefti's obnoxious arrangements."
2,For the Record.,"Earlier I wrote a review for this CD and I mentioned that Charlie Parker wouldn't have enjoyed this himself. Well, that is not for me to say. It is my understanding that Bird had a great appreciation for classical music and he also welcomed the idea of playing w/strings. I will give it 2 stars."
1,Couldn't Deal With The Strings...,"If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker, don't buy this Cd because the strings are too overwhelming, believe me. I bought it and took it back the same day. And got another one of his cd's instead. Only 1 star for this CD but it's not because of Charlie. I don't even think that Charlie Parker would've sincerely enjoyed this."
5,Still ahead of his time,"What Parker did on this album isn't so different from what Miles Davis and Gil Evans did years later with ""Sketches of Spain""- and come to think of it, that album was panned by critics who couldn't understand it, either.When the string intros start up, the casual listener might assume that this album sisn't terribly different from the easy-listening music that pours of of elevators and ""mellow jazz"" radio stations that it's easy to ignore it. But there's something much more complex going on; Parker has created something very rare here; he's taken a music form that few really listened to and framed it in a way that made it more accessible while not compromising his musicality in any way. This isn't the boring and innoffensive harmonies of a Kenny G.; this is Charlie Parker, and he's playing for all it's worth. And it comes through."
2,mustek h120 headset,"the sound was clear and i liked the look and the way it fit , but the ring volume would start out really low and end loud . the call would go to voicemail before you knew you had one coming in."
3,"Please, Tracy, just be yourself!","I never thought I'd give a Tracy Nelson CD less than 5 stars but I was not thrilled with the material here, or maybe it was the arrangements. It sounds like she's trying too hard to be ""up to date"", instead of just doing it HER way...which is always fabulous."
1,yeah ... right!,"Why are there two prats giving this 5 out of 5. They are so obviously joke reviews. This is an awful movie and the zombie scenes are shut with a low shutter speed, so they end up looking like jerky pop-videos.-Mike"
3,Alright,"This movie was okay. It was more funny than scary. And, I do me funny in the intentional way. My only real problem is the end. It seemed rushed. I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,"""Who the f#@k stole my watch!?""","I don't even know what I was thinking when I rented this one. Lori Petty (yes, the Lori Petty. I rented a Lori Petty movie! Oh, the shame!) and Lou Diamond Phillips are U.S. Marshals escorting a prisoner when they stumble upon Route 666 - a old deserted highway which is haunted by slow moving ghost zombies. Well, actually only four slow moving ghost zombies and one of them happens to be Lou Diamond Phillips' father...yea.There are a lot of things wrong with this movie (bad direction, Lori Petty, no ninjas, Lori Petty, lame fx's, Lori Petty, Lori Petty), but the main culprit is the writing. It's almost like this was originally meant to be a episode of something like ""The X-Files"" but once that fell through the three (!!!!!!) writers fleshed it out with annoying dialogue and made a movie.Not the stinkiest stinker that ever did stink, but it's still pretty smelly."
1,dvd movie route 666,"I bought the movie because I like Dale Midkiff, watched the movie for one minute,then burned it!Very bad language!"
1,Run...in the other direction!,"Route 666 is about a federal agent responsible for safely transporting a witness to the courtroom on time. In order to achieve this, he takes a shortcut using a closed road and on the way must confront ghosts from the past and exorcise the demons that haunt him.There's not much that I liked about this film. Lou Diamond Phillips has done some great work in the past but this is not his finest hour. There are many things to dislike about this film. The acting is rather ordinary and the script is quite implausible. Picking holes in the plot is an activity that could take hours all on its own. Many of the actions of the characters simply defy logic.Should anybody watch this movie? Certainly not if you're going to pay any money for it. All in all it's a rather boring movie and the DVD has no extras. If the movie is free then I'd only watch it if you've really got nothing better to do!"
3,"A ""more for TV"" movie","I watched this movie on the scifi channel and I dont think I would ever really want to buy it. The biggest thing that got on my nerves about this movie was the filming. Whenever the evil prisoner zombies were in the scene, the picture would be shaking really fast. It just got SO ANNOYING. Anyway, the plot was okay and the characters were pretty good. I still wouldn't buy it though."
4,Stanley Kunitz is amazing,"I would say that this is not ""lightweight"" poetry and sometimes its rather obscure. I will never read his poems just once. His use of language is pure magic. Sometimes I get lost listening to myself read it rather than even try to ""figure it out"". Other times, I'm transported by the imagery he conjures. All in all, its challenging and demanding. There are moments of fireworks and moments of despair. Its everything life offers if we are brave enough to face it."
2,Hard plastic with bad adhesive,I used these feet on the bottom of a PC to raise it off the floor a bit. I was expecting soft rubber but the plastic that these feet are made of is really hard. As a result the vibration from the computer was transferred to the floor and would occasionally cause an audible vibration against the floor. The adhesive on the feet was horrible. I cleaned the area on the case before I attached the feet but within 3 weeks the feet had become detached and the adhesive was completely dry. Be careful what you use these feet for.
5,These are perfect for HTPC cases that don't come with good feet,"I have a few HTPC cases, like the Realan E-I7 and E-I5 as well as theHabey EMC-800B. I use these cases for myself and for my clients. They all come with these tiny little bubble feet that aren't so great. I've started using these feet instead and they look great. They stick well to the aluminum chassis and lift the cases that much more off the desk that it improves airflow to any vents underneath. You can't beat the price either. It's such a small thing but it really improves the look -- giving the cases that much more of an A/V equipment look.If you like mini-ITX computer cases, be sure to check out the Realan E-I5 and E-I7 through a Google search."
5,These rubber feet are great,"I had to replace some rubber feet on my microwave and looked high and low in my local area appliance repair shops to no avail,look on Amazon and lo and behold access to many different styles colors and prices, these were and are a great deal..."
1,Frustrated with this book,"I am teaching myself to play guitar and thought this book looked like a good one to use, along with others.My problems with this book (and some other books in the Progressive series) are:- Emphasis on techniques isolated from their use in specific songs. At the end of the day, we practice in order to learn to play songs, and that's the context in which techniques should be presented.- Many of the exercises are harder than they have to be in order to develop the technique. The songs at the end of the book require fingerings that are just beyong what a beginner is going to be able to do. Not that the fingerings are the point of the exercise---they are not. They just get in the way. Guitar students need to crawl before they walk, etc."
3,"solid effort, but i still feel...jipped","so after finally locating this circa 1999 promotional, previously unreleased disc on amazon in 2008(for almost $30), untertainment finally decides to make it available for digital download one year later at the bargain basement price of $9.99however, i will say it was a strong debut (i've heard worse...i've heard better) with very notable guest appearances; save the intros & interludes were all HORRIFIC but the lyricism & production was pretty tight."
4,AMAZON'S PATRICIA WENTWORTH HAS DONE IT AGAIN,THIS GAL NEVER FAILS TO SATISFY MY NEEDS FOR A FULFILLING MYSTERY.AN EXCELLENT ESCAPE FROM THE LOCAL NEWS AND EVERYDAY STUFF.
1,ZZZzzz. Bo-oring.,"Don't waste your time on this one. Little mystery, much back and forth 'tween characters and not a whole lot else. I couldn't finish this book. Try Shrouds of Holly, Deadwaiter, Christmas Is Murder...to name a few. Least there's substance and mystery in these."
4,"Great TV, but no 1080p inputs","Great TV with clear picture. Top rated.One thing that's slightly deceiving: it's 1080p display, but it does not support 1080p input signals. For example, you can't turn on the new xbox x360 1080p feature.Customer support confirmed this by writing to me:This unit accepts 480i, 480p, 720p and 1080i signals and displays at 1080p. It cannot accept a 1080p signal."
5,CANT BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE!,"Dont listen to the [people] that said it gets boring and stuff! It is awsome!!! The levels are really fun and x-iting! Gex'swise-cracks are super funny!(I sount like a total [person] just now...super funny...)You get to play a really goofy land were you can just jump into a rabbit whole and disquise yourself as one. When you hop out, be ready for traps, carrets, and... ELMER FUD!!! HA, HA!!! Oh man you've gotta buy this game! Trust me! If you are like me, you'll love it for more than just an hour...""It gets boring! Look at me, I'm a dufis..."" sorry...buy this game and have fun! Oh, and make shur that you are mature enough to handle words like... d_ _ _ or sh_ _. But you will have fun anyway! Thanx for taking the time to read my review!GIRLS RULE!"
3,its ok,"ok, so you get this new game gex, open it up and its pretty good... for an hour. thats it. then it gets soso then it gets REALLY tedious."
2,Just listen to it.,This game started out fun but after about an hour of play I became very bored and frustrated with the frickin' horrible camera angles the computer gives you. I eventually beat it (after hours and hours of changing the camera angles). The only really cool thing about it is Gex's comments. That's all I played it for. I reccomend a rental only.
4,This game is fun and funny but is a bit bad for young kids,This game is so fun and funny. I got this game for my birthday a few weeks ago and i loved. It so funny with the one liners from dana gould. But I am warning you do not let people under the age of at least 8 to play because it has bad words in it. My game kept saying the D word over and over and over. I have a five year old brother and he heard the d word and he said over and over and over. I am warning you this game is really fun and funny but dont let little kids play it or even listen to it. But for sure this game is much better than Croc and Croc2.
2,Review of Gex Enter the Gecko,It's a very long and hard game. If you're going to play it you should plan some time too. Playing the beginning is fun but after playing the same levels with more difficulty (that's practically what it is) it gets boring and frustrating.
3,Game works,"The game works and i got it as a gift for somebody and they enjoy it as it brings them back good old memories, it was pretty used and the case was so-so, for its price and the fact it works, it got my 3, thanks again."
1,fell apart,"Several years ago I had purchased this same spell checker and used it almost daily for a few years. It finally quit working and I searched high and low for the same one. Found it and was quite excited to finally get it. After only about 3-4 months the screen got real light and the script was not solid but missed a lot of the pixels and was unable to be read. Unless I got a bad one, these Seiko spell checkers have really become a piece of junk."
2,Good artwork...,"but that's all. The stories are not even close to realistic. In fact, some are not even stories, just short scenes. Some humor, group sex, a couple of cases of rape and a few people even seem to die. Oh, bananas, cheerleaders and panties. Think porn in manga form, with little or no plot. If you like that kind of thing, good for you, but I was looking for something more. Kind of costed a lot for something so thin. I would suggest Yuuki Ryoh's mangas.But, still, good artwork. Maybe even GREAT artwork. And funny bonus comments at the end of the book. For adults ONLY."
3,Not Bad,"Being a huge Led Zeppelin fan from day one (early '69 in college), I was anxious to see Page again. I'm not a big U-2 fan and I was not even familiar with Jack White.This is a fun DVD, with excellent video and sound, but I was hoping for a little more playing and a little less talking. Don't get me wrong, I'm a rock music history adict and this has chunks of that but I was looking for a little more balance towards the playing side.I don't think this DVD is for everyone. It's not a concert. You really can't put it on and go about your business and listen around the house. To get anything out of it, it's something you really need to sit down and focus on.So check it out if you like the players, but I'm guessing you won't be watching it over and over again."
3,rampant expectations,If you're a huge fan of all three of these guys you might love this film. But if you're just a big Page fan you may find it a bit less than awesome. This is a film not about great guitar playing but about three of the most famous musicians of their respective generations. Whether or not the Edge or Jack White is a great guitar player is a matter of opinion. One thing is obvious. These three have almost nothing in common and it shows. There's lots of biographical clips but no complete songs. The fact that Page isn't going to sing on any of his bits explains their brevity. Fortunately a deleted scene shows Page playing a new two minute piece on acoustic and that is the musical highlight of the dvd.
5,Great Flick!,If you play guitar or aspire to this is a must see. I loved the difference in styles of three generations of guitarists.
5,A great rock and roll film!,I love this film!After watching it I wish I had learned how to play guitar!As a huge u2 fan I enjoyed the insight into thier music that this film provided.The only negative is that the film is too short!
2,Meh....,"First off, Jack White doesn't deserve a place in this film. Everything about his ""persona"" is irritating to me.I like a few White Stripes and Ranconteurs songs... but overall, he's too over-rated for my tastes.The whole child version of himself watching him play, dressed in similar clothes.... meh... Seems way too contrived.When they finally get to meeting each other, it is cool to see them play their riffs in a group setting. Page playing Ramble On solo is a highlight for sure.Edge is cool... he goes back through his demo tapes of riffs from Joshua Tree, but really nothing new if you have seen the Classic Albums JT dvd.Overall a good rental I guess, but I wouldn't buy this for $20. Rent it first and decide for yourself."
2,Surprisingly BORING.,"I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here, but this documentary is just plain boring. It's kinda cool to see each musician play at first, but the longer the movie goes on, the more you realize there is no over-arching POINT to any of it. It's basically just one giant mash-up. It could have been a great movie if it just had something -- ANYTHING -- to say. Instead it just piddles away a couple of hours without making any kind of real impression."
4,WHY is Jack White in this...?,"Presenting fantastic interviews with guitar god Jimmy Page, sound pioneer The Edge, and.... some guy who plays derivative blues-rock of about the caliber you could find by waltzing into any guitar store in the Western World.Never having heard of Jack White, I watched some videos of his bands on YouTube. Okay, standard mediocre white kid doing electric blues... WHY is he in this...? White's presence was not made more tolerable by his unbroken posture of condescension.P.s. - Yes, I'm a self-identified old fuddy-duddy."
5,Great buy!,"I bought this as a gift for my fianc√©, who is a bass player and he LOVED IT:). The price was great and the product was in perfect condition! I was very pleased and recommend this product to anyone who enjoys these musicians:)"
5,One of my favorites to date,This is a gem of a film. To see the creative process of these men was remarkable! I highly recommend it.
5,Very enjoyable,"A rather strange trio to throw together, but what great fun to listen and watch them play together. No big revelations other than I have a lot more respect for the edge as an artist than I did before. I hope when I'm Page's age I can still play at all; the man still rocks. Jack White is a nut. ""Go on!! Pick a fight with it!!!!"" If you buy this movie with no expectations other than to be thoroghly entertained you'll do just fine, just get a beer, crank up the surround sound and enjoy."
2,not what I expected,"U2 is my favorite band, and The Edge is one of the reasons. I saw a brief clip of this movie on Utube, profiling him..I thought, boy, a whole DVD profiling him and the other two musicians should really be awesome. Watched it, and wished I could have got my $ back"
5,it might get loud,absolutely awesome guitar playing 3 legends at work must see viewing play it loud and play it often jimmy page and the edge are fantastic 10/10
5,Excellent. A must watch for guitar people,"I was unable to catch this when it was first on TV. I came across it online and was finally able to see it. It was awesome. I immediately ordered one here off of Amazon. I don't really follow David Evans, and I am not that much into guitar effects, so Jack White and Jimmy Page are the draws for me. But the entire show is filmed very well with a pleasant style. It also goes to show that people who work hard at something all their lives deserve the rewards. These three guys have worked their tails off to get where they are. This should really get 6 stars."
5,The history of rock guitar.,"I borrowed one of this for months. I got addicted. I am a drummer. But this is history. The god Jimmy Page telling his history its like listening to Merlin and his miracles.Plus, I became a fan of Jack White."
5,Awesome Documentary!!!!,3 of my favs with decades of talent between them - The jam sessions they have together & the different styles they each have musically are just so incredible to witness! I highly reccommend this DVD to anyone that's a fan of any one of the 3!!! Just Awesome!!!
5,Loud it is,"If you're a rocker, young or old, you need to see/hear this. Incredible. Check bonus material."
2,Boring-The Edge was the only interesting part,"A bit disappointed in this documentary-Got bored and shut it off after an hour. Jack White was boring and wierd, but Jimmy Page and The Edge from U2 were OK. It was worth a try:)"
1,Not what was promised,Three amazing musicians of different backgrounds get together to share ideas and approaches. Great concept! This is how this movie was marketed.Unfortunately it is not what is delivered. 90% of it is looking back with voice overs of the individuals talking about their history and only 10% of it they are actuallytogether playing and interacting. It's okay but not what was promised in the trailers. Many of the things they express I've seen on youtube and magazinesover the years. Nothing new. I was excited to see the dynamic of them together and was disappointed in how little there was of it. Sony Pictures should beashamed of marketing this the way they have. A great idea unrealized and then deceptively presented to make a quick buck.
1,a great disappointment,"I'll make this short and sweet.I followed the hype on-line for a year until the film was finally release and made its way to a theater 60 miles away. I made the drive and was incredibly underwhelmed by what I saw and heard.I didn't care for the pacing or organization of the film... slow and disjointed. The selection of The Edge and Jack White must have been purely convenience motivated as there is a long list of more interesting electric guitarists whose inclusion would have made much more sense. The only shared performance was ""The Weight"" and I might add, they couldn't even get the chords right. Utterly embarrassing.I've seen the process of how a bad film gets made in spite of the best intentions of those involved. My only guess is that this film went down that same road.If it weren't for the scene of Jimmy Page in his music room listening to Link Wray's 1958 innovative bombshell ""The Rumble"", I couldn't even give this film 1 star.Save your money."
5,Awesome,Amazing documentary from three great unique and different guitarists. It goes get loud and it's worth it. so worth it
4,A Good View For Those Interested In The Creative Process.,"""It Might Get Loud"" is an excellent documentary for those who want to look into the different creative processes behind some popular rock guitarists, both young and old. Some have critizied Jack White's role in this film but it's obvious. He presents himself as a low-tech, go-by-feel, minimal guitar effect guy. He is anti-The Edge in this regard, as we see The Edge explain his dependence on rack upon rack of effects to obtain his sound. Jimmy Page is the elder scholar throughout. The glimpse of his guitar collection, guitar cases lined up in a storage area, is impressive. I didn't expect him to be as articulate as he is in this piece.IMGL is a very well directed and produced film. Shots are interestingly framed and audio is excellent throughout.A very good watch for anyone interested in how guitarists may go about their creative process."
3,It does get loud...,"Well after hearing the White Stripes officially split last week, I was moved to rent this. This was a fun and easy watch, but I'm one of those fans of all three guitarists and bands too. I think Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White were well chosen for this. Three different generations of men, that love and rock the guitar well. I think the film spent about the same amount of time on the three of them, maybe Page was shorted a few minutes. I did enjoy the moments they just sat around and played their own songs, as the other two watched with smiles and appreciation. When Page cranked-up Whole Lotta Love you could see the Edge smile like a little kid. The opening minutes was Jack White making a guitar out of spare parts including a soda bottle, MacGuyver-style. That was cool. Are you a rocker? If so you'll dig this."
4,"For musicians, particularly rock guitarists.","I enjoyed this DVD, but bought it primarily because I am a U2 fan. I agree somewhat with other reviewer's notes for this product, as Jack White's portayed attitude/facial expression is abrasive by comparison and he doesn't seem to add much value to the discussion at first. However, if you watch this with an open mind and if you like his stuff already, it is decent and you can dig where he's coming from. He just comes off as a punk kid amongst rock history legends; maybe it is intended. Different music styles and generation differences might skew how one views this DVD. All said, it was worth the money, and I recommend that any fan of these guys, or rock history in general, at least watch this production once. It opened my interests enough to check out more of White's music and you can't go wrong be delving into more Led Zep! U2 will remain favorite, for me. A couple U2 gems in there, and a old video clip of U2 that I never knew existed."
4,Thought Provoking,"As a songwriter, this film gave me great food for thought. The way each player approaches the same instrument--and the brilliant results each achieves--is a testament to the raw power of creativity. This is a great film, but I feel it could have been enhanced with added historical footage. I was also slightly underwhelmed by the attempt to cover ""The Weight"" in the final minutes."
4,Great Video!,"I bought this for my husband who is a rock music fanatic and in a band. He enjoyed watching it and is passing it around to his friends so they can see it too!He had not heard about it coming out, and was delighted to see Jimmy Page especially, but said the overall documentary was really interesting and good."
3,Mixed baggage,"The director clearly has an infatuation for Jack White, since he gets more screen time than Jimmy Page or Edge, almost more than them combined. This is unfortunate, since I think he's the least talented, least interesting, and most pretentious of the trio. In a way, I felt a bit cheated, since very little of the film reflects the promotional aspect - the three of them sitting together and discussing their varied approaches to making music. That material can be found (and not nearly enough of it for my liking) in some of the DVD extras, which I found more interesting than the cut film itself. It's worth a watch, but unless you're a Jack White fan, prepare to be a bit disappointed."
3,Less interesting than it could have been,"If you're a rock guitar player, you may enjoy this. But everyone else will probably be a bit bored as Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White discuss their love affairs with guitars. Page, of course, has by far the longest and most interesting bio of the three, while White, at age 34, is still evolving, and the Edge is concerned mainly with his many effects pedals and boxes to make his guitar sound like anything but. The three only jam a bit at the end on a Zep tune and one by The Band. That's when the movie is most interesting, although I really enjoyed one of the deleted scenes in which Page describes how he came up with the guitar riff on ""Kashmir,"" as the Edge looks on fascinated. White seems clearly less reverent about the other two than the Edge does toward Page. When you look back at who created what, however, it's clear that Page will probably leave the biggest legacy. Watch this film if you like films about rock music."
4,Great for fans of Page,For insight into the mind of the legendary Led Zep maestro this one can't be beat. I don't have much interest in the Edge or Jack White for that matter but they both are interesting characters with a story to tell. For me it was all about J Page at 65 still with the magic and the charm that helped make Zep a monster band amongst mortals.
4,4Star Review,"This flick rox!!!! very smart, very talented people coming together to share their knowledge & love of the electric guitar. Awesome flick!!!!!"
4,Seeing Pagey here is worth putting up with the other two,"I watched this because seeing Pagey in this kind of detail is rare.One has to put up with Jack White (as white as they come, good name) and Dull Edge (incongruous seeing him on stage--or the same planet--with Jimmy Page) but overall is is worth it. I did have to go to ""mute"" on several occasions, when I could not stand it."
3,"The stars have it right this time -- ""It's OK""","I was expecting a lot more out of this. Very little footage of the three of them together. This is basically three mini -life bios with a little footage of them together spread throughout. There were some cool pieces but not $18 worth. Also, if you are a fan of these three guitarists chances are you have already seen at least a few of the performances from other sources. This disc reminds me of the history channel where they take a few experts, talk about the subject and intersperse some old clips or art.I recommend Led's 2003 DVD and White's Black Pool Lights.Rent this one first."
3,Movie has a Dull Edge,"If they replaced The Edge with Keith Richards, it would be a 5 Star. The Edge actually shows us in the film what a limited guitarist he is, couple that with his Dull Personality, and it pulls the film down. Keith would have been a much better choice."
2,Jack White might love himself,"I think this was all about Jack White and how great he thinks he is. There was about 10 seconds spent on The Edge's sound, and Jimmy Page wondering around some old castle. Way too much time spent on silly Jack White montages. If you were hoping for some good jams, you will be severely disappointed."
5,"Musical Summit, indeed!","Having a chance to see Jimmy Page up-close and personal after all these years was truly a gift! The man's STILL GOT IT!!! Seeing how HE played some of those fabulous Zep songs was also 'a gift'! Learning more about Edge; and where he came from (and all the U2 boys) was very interesting - especially the school vid of them as teenagers. Wow - were they ever ROUGH!!! But lookit how THEY turned out! Gives the rest of us hope!!! Jack White I was not familiar with. (And thought him lesser - why should HE be here?) But he kinda does (just) hold his own in here. Overall: extremely, extremely well worth investigating for any Zep/U2 fan; and any fan of guitar in general. ~BTFP."
5,"Loud yet not always so Loud, but always GREAT!",Great exchange of 2 veterans in Page & Edge w/Jack White as a great intermediary to round out the trio. If you write music you will love to watch this over and over again to appreciate the creative process that may inspire you to press on! If you do not write music will still find a deep well of understanding & appreciation for what goes into the lives of some of the legendary guitarists!
5,An Artist's Journey,"Even if you are not a fan of The White Stripes, Led Zeppelin or U2 you will enjoy this film!These three musicians of three different generations are truly artists and use the guitar as their medium. Just as painters might choose oils, pastels or watercolors, they use a hunk-of-wood laced with steel strings and magnets to ""paint"" their sonic landscapes.Truly inspirational for musicians and artists of any kind!"
4,it Might get loud,"Great hearing their stories on how they got started, and mixing in three different generations made this interesting. Being a huge fan of Jimmy Page I did not know much about Jack Stripe - and now after seeing it want to get some of his Music. Could have used a little more actual playing by the three together as in complete songs versus the partials they showed"
3,Could have been better,I say could have been because I saw the whole thing and more in bits and pieces on Youtube.Had I looked further I could have reviewed the actual full length video as well before purchasing.It's kind of nice to have just for the purpose of sharing but there was a lot of scenes left out of the video that one can view on Youtube and for that reason I gave it 3 stars.
5,Inspirational instead of musical,"This DVD tells more about how the artists arrived at where they are, instead of it being a session of 3 completely different guitarists playing music. If you are expecting a musical DVD, you will not get much satisfaction from this. If you want to know the history behind each of these gentlemen, you will LOVE this DVD."
5,Awesome Video,I have watched this a couple times and will watch it again. I get more out of it musically each time. What a great idea to have three great guitarists share their insights with us!
2,So far so good...whoops i spoke too soon.,"I bought this memory card recently, and it worked great for a while. I rented Pikmin and saved it with this card, which worked fine for the whole game (which is why i give this memory card 2 stars instead of 1). But then i tried to save 007: Agent Under Fire and i got some message about corrupt data and had to format the memory card (erase everything on it) in order to get it to work again. I suppose the card glitches out and loses data every now and then, which is completely unacceptable in my book. I guess i should have figured this 3rd party card wouldn't be all that reliable, but it was the only GameCube memory card the store had at the time so i bought it. But i recommend staying clear of this memory card and sticking with Nintendo's, at least you're guaranteed it will work."
3,Hmm....,"Nice price and cool looking design. Comes with a free case, too. If you're anything like me, you're thinking ""Wow! So cheap!"" But you get what you pay for. For $... more, get the Nintendo brand, if you really want to get a memory card this small to start with. I've had the card for about 4 months now and I've only lost data on it once. And THAT was very annoying. This card is decent for a third party card; I mean hey, at least it works with the Gamecube Memory Editor thing. I've seen cards that won't even do that much. If you really want a deal, get the Nintendo brand 251 block card. I definitely recommend getting a name brand memory card if you care anything about your game saves. It's really annoying to play a game that won't even detect your third party card (i.e. Mad Catz memory cards) and then you have to go and get a name brand card anyway. Consider this your warning. ;)"
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,this memory card is awful! i've only had it for a little over a year now and i've already had format it 3 times!!! thats a lot over memory to lose! so i say if you are gonna get a memory card get one by nintendo....and burn the old one!!
3,Ok,"Choreography is kinda hard, different from the other more current Pump it Ups. Music is not as fun either. Not the best video out of the others."
2,Choppy and hard to follow,"The best aspect of this movie was that it is ill titled; the result of an unfortunate misstranslation. The themes and ideas presented in the movie are thought provoking, however the cinimatography was difficult to watch, and harder to follow.The PG13 rating stems from a couple of crude jokes, and one totally unneeded and unexpected nude scene."
4,One Of My Favorite Movies,"This is one of my favorite movies that I have watched countless times ever since I purchased it. It's got a great plot along with good acting. The movie's plot deals with how a girl researched and uncovered a lot of history that the town folks would rather have kept hidden and buried, regarding the role the German town took during World War II. Lena Stolze does a great job in the lead role. This is one of the best German movies I've ever seen. The only thing that should be changed is the title of the movie. It's misnamed. The title is very misleading and more than likely keeps people from viewing this. But other than that, this is a great movie that's also funny that you can watch over and over. Totally recommended."
5,A Brilliant Examination of Germany's Past and Present,"The story of Sonja's hometown in Bavaria is the story of Germany, a country struggling with an identity crisis and a lack of national self-esteem. How does a country responsible for the worst war, and the worst crimes, of the century come to terms with its present and future? The first draft of Sonja's essay on her hometown presents the fabled ""good Germans"" we all want to believe existed exclusively during the third Reich, but as she digs further, she finds that not everyone was against, or even neutral, to the removal of jews from Germany. Sonja discovers the power of propaganda and prejudice, and learns that its effects still linger, as she encounters resistance to her search for the truth in this powerful film about a country coming to terms with its past."
5,A comedy about town protecting a nasty secret,"Sonja (Lena Stolze) - an apparently ordinary girl - decides to research her German town's Nazi history during Hitler's reign for a school project starting from the town's archive. In the process, she discovers that her town - including prominent citizens - was heavily involved in the holocaust by the Third Reich. Almost everyone in town not only turns against her, but some even try to silence her. But her work leads to an honorary doctorate from... neighboring Austria. Now, she not only cannot be silenced, but even ignored anymore.This comedy is a masterpiece study of a quite typical behavior of group to protect its interest based on these particular events. But, they could have happened at any other time in any other country ever experiencing atrocities, so practically almost everywhere. That universal dimension makes the movie really great."
1,DVD does not play in region 1,"The dvd does not play in all regions as the box suggests. At any rate, it does not play on my dvd player or my (new) laptop. Find a different distributor. (I highly recommend the film itself, which I have viewed before.)"
1,"non fun, collects lots of dust",not what i was looking for. really boring. well i was sent a scratch up copy that only played once.
4,Solid entry in the post-apocalypse category,"I first read this book shortly after it came out, and I liked it so much I've hung on to it ever since. It is pitched at a high-school comprehension level, but the ending is both philosophically and practically tidy - a way forward even for we who never suffered through the horrors of a nuclear war. But maybe we will have to rediscover an Edwardian political simplicity to find that path, as Arakal and his cabinet do in this book. Certainly the justification for the enforced stasis of the Soviets in this book is sound if only on an Earthly level.By the way, I never buy into those books that project so complete a breakdown after a nuclear war that books and libraries don't survive. I read the studies - while a complete war would kill billions, most of the deaths would be due to systems breakdowns and not fallout or nuclear winter. People might fall ill and starve, but things would survive better."
3,Truncated plot,"I find it inexplicable that this edition omits the first part of the story, which was published in Analog as ""Ideology Counts"" and introduced Arakal, General Brusilov and the rest. Taking them up in media res could easily confuse readers who did not have the background laid out gradually."
1,So sad,"Sadly, not useful. No formulas, but trivial ones, can be read. The preview is of a different (useful) version, though there isn't a proper warning; it does mention that it is a different book you view, but for a math/physics book it would only be fair to inform that formulas were demolished by the OCR handling. The claim in the book that most of their books are freely available as digital copies does not fare much better. You have to pay $9.99 for the ""free digital copy"". Luckily, Google Books have the book."
4,clasic calamity,"6 classics on one jampacked disc.missle command,super breakout,centepiede,asteroids,battlefield,tempest.takes me back to the 80s of classic decades past.you will love this oldschool games."
4,The game that started an acrade revolution for all systems,Story problem: Classic games+neat designers+very nice narrator+cool grapics & sound=a very excellent game!
5,Back down memory lane,This collection brings back so many memories of the early 80's I feel like I'm back at the arcade with all my friends. Centipede just captured the moment. I think I played it for six hours straight. I would like to thank ATARI personally for letting me re-live some of my teenage years. I can't seem to get enough now It's back to AMAZON.com for more.
2,This Game Sucks,"I found this game very boring and stupid. It does have the best classic games ever made on it. but i didn't find them that enjoyable, but centapide was fun the best on there. All in all it was okay i wouldn't buy it."
2,For the specialist collector,"Any recital of Handel Opera arias is worthwhile, especially one that concentrates on lesser-known works. But Jean-Loup Charvet does not impress here. His intonation is poor, and he sounds very tentative in all. This may be due to physical weakness, since he seems to have died (at a very young age) shortly after this recording was made. For the Handel specialist only."
3,HIGH TIME,"MAGIC DICK & JAY GEILS-BLUESTIME: As a singer, MAGIC DICK is mostly an unparalleled harp player; then again, THE J. GEILS BAND boasted one of the most exhileratin' soul spewin' frontmen in all of rock & roll, PETER WOLF. Distancing themselves from their former group's party-hearty vibe, BLUESTIME plies the classic CHICAGO BLUES sound, reviving CHESS RECORDS chestnuts from BO DIDDLEY, LITTLE WALTER, and MUDDY WATERS with less volume but more reverence and attention to detail; the lone original here is FULL COURT PRESS, a fiesty instrumental cousin to the JGB barn-burner WHAMMER JAMMER. JAY GEILS is simply one of our most tasteful, non-flashy axemen, coloring without crowding, while MAGIC DICK's swingin' harmonica chops mostly compensate for his journeyman vocals. For a quick lesson in jazzy sophistication and jump blues felicity, one could do far worse than scheduling some BLUESTIME.RATING: THREE JUKE JOINTS"
3,Pretty good LP from young jazz paino leader,"Saw Stephen Scott with Sonny Rollins and since Sonny has gone of into Calypso land and Bob Cranshaw just ran the numbers on electric (say's Sonny can't hear acoustic) was always most impressed with Scott.Here he plays well and chooses standards that are great.But you know that thing where it just won't hold you for one sitting and you split listening up.It's strange for me to say why because technically Scott is fine and plays with great flourish.His ""Black,Brown,and Beige"" type of three(MP3) or four part piece is not exactly up to his technique.Since it's cheap what's the risk.It's still a solid CD from a talented player.CheersChazz"
3,Okay but not as I remembered,"I bought this book for my infant granddaughter. I was looking for the simple prayers I remember and the only one that is in this book that is familiar is ""A Great Gray Elephant"". I was hoping for the dinner grace""God is Great, God is Good, let us thank him for this food. Amen"".Also some of the words have changed. I suppose for the better but I was a bit disappointed. Not sure if it will get used as much as I hoped."
1,Aquick Ship!,My book arrived right on the day you said it would.A very attactive book I will give the book to just the right little girl.Thanks Bertha
2,HP Bag,I like the bag a lot. It is convenient having my computer and portable printer in one bag. The bag arrived with a cut in the handle and don't think it is going to last all that long as a result. Will probably have to buy another one by end of the year.
5,Wow!!,"I bought this game as a part of a deal in order to get a free movie for my PSP, and I really didn't think I'd be too impressed. You see, I'm not truley a baseball fanatic. But the moment I turned on this game I was hooked. TRUE to life batting styles. Great commentary, and an awesome Season mode are only a few of the amazing features for this PS2---wait, PSP game (I feel like I'm playing the PS2 version every time I turn it on).If you have even an inkling of fun playing a baseball game, I have no doubt this game is for you.One piece of critiscm, just so you know I don't work for sony...Load Times can be annoying, but I usually can find something to do for the 45 seconds anyway. It's WORTH THE WAIT."
5,Great baseball game,"I'v been a baseball fan my whole life, and have played dozens of video/computer baseball games. This is by far my favorite - excellent graphics and commentary, very realistic game-play. Just a few criticisms: 1) it's hard to control runners on you own. I just let the computer control the runners. 2) however, when you let the computer control your runners it's hard to steal a base. Even the fast runners get thrown out regularly."
1,Not as good,"I rented this game and I am glad that I didn't buy it right away. The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it. Bottom line, dont buy it!"
5,Very best PSP baseball game,"This is a very fun baseball game. Loved playing career mode. Did it once as a pitcher (broke Cy Young's 511 win record) and once as a batter (broke most records). Only drawback that is part of most PSP games is the looooong load times. One thing that is particularly nice about this 2006 MLB video game is that it's the only game I have played that NEVER locks up. Most other games will lock up if you press buttons at the wrong times, often during loading. I have played this game for hundreds of hours without a single lockup - so you don't have to save at every opportunity. Its proof that if the program is very well written, its idiot proof."
5,Purchased as a gift for my nephew...,About a year ago his older brother got '06 MLB The Show. Both boys loved it and both wanted to play it all the time. The younger brother requested the game as a birthday present and is delighted with it. Both boys do not get tired of the game. They believe '06 The Show is best of the baseball psp games. I highly recommend this game for baseball fans.
4,A better version of H.I.M.,"Entwine are a Goth Metal band from Finland. They are in the vain of Paradise Lost or Flowing Tears. Their lead singer, Mika Tauriainan, sounds a lot like Ville Vallo of the popular band H.I.M. The difference is, that H.I.M.'s material is predominately Hard Rock, and Entwine's music is crunchier and heavier. It sounds like a combination between other Gothic Metal acts and a band like H.I.M. The lyrics may be a bit sappy, but this band is moving and fun to listen to. If you like Heavy Metal with clean vocals, or if you are a fan of Goth Metal, check this band out. All of their albums are different. None of them sound alike."
5,"GOOD, but When Does it End !!?!","It's now 1 year since i read the 7th book,and i'm dieing to read the next,so when does it come out , anyone ?."
2,A Crown of Thorns dosn't cut it,"What started as a great series has long ago begun to drag. Book seven of this series acomplishes nothing. Rand is going insane already, we get it. Actually we got it about 1,800 pages ago. Nothing new happens. Everytime I go to the bookstore I can't remember whether or not I read this book. It is not a good sign when I can't remember the book."
4,Cant wait till the next one !!!,I waited so long for this chapter that it probably could have been terrible and I would still have enjoyed it. But Robert Jordan was true to form with this book (Exceptional !!!). I devoured it within 2 days time and had to read it again becuse I felt I went through it to fast. RJ's writing style is so enchanting it compels you to continue waiting for the next twist. RJ takes the time between battle's and fills it with build up that is a must read. Alot like forplay it is designed to enhance the final confrontation for a much more enjoyable climax.
2,This promising series has turned ugly in a hurry.,"Crown of Swords is even more boring than Lord of Chaos. The rich characters, complex plot, and imaginative creatures are starting to annoy my sense of adventure. Characters learn nothing from their experiences and keep making the same stereotypical mistakes they have made in the past six books. They also must be somewhat dull to miss the obvious connections and clues planted by the author.I was RJ's biggest fan for this series. Unfortunately, it has turned into a dull and predictible plot. My only hope is that as he begins to wrap this series up, it will regain its former luster.My personal plea Mr. Jordan: You have proven you can build a new imaganitive series from your success with the Wheel of Time. Isn't it time to move on and create a new plot and set of characters?I'm begining to doubt my ability to continue reading the next book in this series, but I'll probably give you one more chance (but this time in paperback!)"
3,Good Effort,"Not as good as his previous efforts, but a decent book. I would call it transitional. Before = better. After = worse."
5,Wow!,"Robert Jordan is the best! I never thought that I could read fantacy books, but my friend forced me. Now I am hooked. I love the way A Crown of Swords only covered about a weeks time. It gave me a chance to watch the characters a little closer. They are wonderful. It seems like I know them. I really like the way girls play a big part of the series, and even though my friends all think I'm crazy Nynaeve is the best. I didn't think that this book was a dissapointment at all. I've heard some people say they couldn't finish it but that just goes to show that they are not true Robert Jordan fans."
3,Should have wrapped it up in 3 books,"None of the books are actually that bad, but it seems to drag on quite a bit. Voumes are wasted with nothing really happening. Sure RJ can bring the reader into the world but nothings going on. I think that he could have easily wrapped it all up in three of four books. I will continue to read his work, but I advise my friends not to."
3,Where's the DETAIL!!!!,"I have been a tremendous fan of WoT since 7th grade (seemingly ancient history as I move on to college). I loved everyone of his books. They are imaginative, detailed, and, most importantly, consistent. RJ never loses the main plot though he works on several subplots at the same time. If this is the case, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!!!! The book went no where. He has not started to reslove any of the plot matters. And what pissed me off the most is how he skimmed over the Nyneve and Lan thing like it was of no interest. Their love has been boiling for 6 books and we don't even see the wedding!!! The next book ought to be brilliant lest I become more pissed!"
2,Needs an editor,"OK, it all started out fine. The first few books were entertaining, but now that I am commited (time and money) in this reading endeavor, I am getting bored. There are so many people coming and going here, I don't even pretend to follow it. Carhein, Caimleyn (sorry about the spelling), it has gone on so long I can not even remember the difference anymore. I just skip ahead until I find something to hold my interest. I mostly read/skim each of these books just looking for whole paragraphs, and sometimes even chapters, that could have been edited out to make the story move along. I used to recommend this series to everyone, but no longer. I can't bring myself to get someone else sucked into this 10 (15?) (20?) book series. I'll keep reading though, with the hope that the next book moves along."
2,Treading Water,"This series has steadily declined since Book 3 (by far the best in the series). Sometimes I think RJ is treading water, and adds needless subplots just to occupy some characters while something else is happening. I think he's found that he's killing off too many of the forsaken, and has been replacing them with new bad guys who, unfortunately, have no personality. This book didn't end as climactically as the rest. This may be the weakest book of the series, except for perhaps the one where some characters joined the circus (and we spent 300 pages hearing about it)."
4,"good, but not great","Jordan has too many plot lines going on. All the different character groups are causing the story to slow down to a snails pace. For this reason I think Jordan should have written written this as another 900 pager.I would advise not getting this book(not gonna happen) until the next one comes out, and then reading them together.Still, the Wheel of Time series is the best Fantasy Series I've ever read, and I've read a lot. I hope you enjoy them as much as I have."
3,A good addition to the Wheel of Time,"I like the Wheel of Time series. The seventh book is not the best of the series. Jordan spent way too much time reviewing who is who, and whats what; instead of jumping right into the story. Not too much happened in this novel. I still think the series is great and to continue the story you have to read this book."
2,Endlessly going... NOWHERE,"This book continues Jordan's attempt to use 900 pages of text to get you noplace. The story has stalled over the last book or two, and I find myself not caring what happens to anybody.. and Jordan is so vague in what does happen to his characters that sometimes you don't know. I'm so tired of the bad guys slipping out the back door, or ""maybe"" being killed... just kill one, so we can feel that the 900 page lead in was worth it.Give up on all the Jr. High behavior between the Aes Sedai and Mattrim... tired...Liven up the action, strengthen the cause and DO SOMETHING!Okay, I'm off to read the next version of Jordan's Dictionary (words in random order, simulating sentences)... I just want it to end.."
5,Great Series,"Its hard to review The Wheel of Time as seperate books,this one is a bit slower paced than some of the others but still a great read. I wouldnt suggest reading as a stand alone book but over all great if you love well written fantasy"
4,Great Series - Fair Book,"I thoroughly enjoy the series but, like many other reviewers, Jordan needs to get to the point. while I thoroughly enjoyed the book, there appears to be a lot of repetition of searchs, plights for the heros, decisions that need to be made over and over again. Tolkien was the best - and he actually cut through all of his clutter to get to the point quickly. Can hardly wait for the next book!!"
5,Robert Jordan is gifted!,"Robert Jordan is the most gifted writer I have ever read. I rated this book a 10 because I believe even Robert Jordan at his worst is still the best. Yes, I agree with most of the negative comments about this volume. It is long and not as good as the earlier ones, but in a way that is good because although I want to know how it will all work itself out, I am reluctant to end the best series ever produced. It is so rich and teeming with life. How could you not have anybody to root for. Even a character who shows up to open the door for the major characters is a real person with a life and background. I say so what if it takes Jordan 13 volumes to wrap up his story. I'll stick with it to the end and enjoy it every step of the way, and when I finish the last volume, I'll say to myself how unfortunate it is that he finished."
4,"Is The Writing On the Wall, will he give up?","The first four books were excelent, even better than Tolkein. In the 'Wheel Of Time' series Jordan shows that he is the master of creating a fantasy 'universe'. Unfortunately the weath of absorbing detail means that the plot starts to grind to a halt, especially so in 'aCoS' (the timespan of the book is only two weeks). If he continues his trend it seems that it will be another 3-4 books before he can even contemplate finishing. The crunch point is that the story showed that Jordan has no idea how to end his epic series and even more important is the fact that aCoS was published in 1996 and the release date for the 8th book is pencilled in at 3rd Q. 1998. Does this mean that Jordan will give up the series as a project to difficult to bother to complete?"
2,Plot? We don't need no stinkin' plot!,"Reading ""A Crown of Swords"" has convinced me to give up on ""The Wheel of Time"" series. Indeed, I feel like a fool for sticking with it this long. I had hoped that Jordan would finally start moving on the underlying story line of this series -- namely, the final confrontation between Rand and the forces of darkness. However, it looks like this isn't going to happen any time soon. Character and plot development (or even subplot development!) are negligible. Instead, ""ACOS"" contains a great deal of irrelevant description that does not advance the story. By the time the final climactic battle occurs (in book 35 at the current pace), who will care? More to the point, how could it possibly live up to this kind of buildup?Maybe I should stick to short novels like ""War and Peace"" from now on"
2,Con Job,"Jordan is progressively getting worse. The first 3 books of the series started very well-tightly written, well-paced with page-ripping suspense. Since then, the story just deteriorated, culminating with this bomb of a book. Jordan is ripping the readers off. His 640-page book could have been at least halved. Book 7 has made no significant progress in the storyline. At the rate he's going, Jordan will need Book 20 to finish if off. What is he doing? Filling in the blanks? I'm beginning to suspect he's trying to get bigger bang for his bucks.It's a shame. He really has many original ideas. I felt cheated"
3,"Cautious, waiting for the next release","Mr Jordan does a good job of laying the foundation for: 1) The meeting between Sammael and himself. 2) Setting the stage for the alliance, through marriage(?) with the Seanchen. HOWEVER, there are so many major loose ends pending in the entire series that it looks like there will be another ten books to follow.- Harry Rossman"
3,Faile is annoying,"I feel that I am being too kind with my rating of 6. The whole subplot with Queen Tyling seemed to me a waste of time, and vulgar toboot. Faile is annoying almost to the point ofbeing painfully so, and her mind games with Perrin are excruciating. The point is that these subplots take up far too much space,seemingly more so than the important stuff.The ending seemed rushed, as if the author suddenly remembered there was something important he had to resolve and hurried to complete it. Another minus: ridiculously detailed descriptions of clothing of people youwouldn't know from a hole in the ground andexplanations of how pretty certain charactersare or aren't. I'll probably continue to read this series, but definitely not continue to buyit"
2,Sigh.,"All of the Wheel of Time books (in paperback; I'm poor) are sitting on my shelf in a tidy row. So why, when I'm looking for something familiar to read in bed or in the tub, do I reach instead for Tepper, Cherryh, Le Guin, Zelazny, Moorcock?The answer is that this series is getting tired. Jordan has severely lost the focus that made the first three books so good, and I wonder how he's ever going to tie up all these loose ends. Or will he take the sloppy way out and leave them hanging? Certainly that happens in real life, but it makes for sloppy fiction.This book has some funny moments and interesting plot twists, but that's about it. Jordan has also lost his grasp of his female characters, who are in severe danger of being reduced to one-dimensional bitches. Although I did rather enjoy Elayne's triumph in, what was it, chapter 30? These books need more moments like that, and fewer throwaway characters, mysterious plots and petty squabbling"
1,PONDEROUS & PLODDING,"The reading gets more and more ponderous as the series plods along. Plods along, though, denotes movement forward, and like a sinking ship in calm water, this storyline really hasn't progressed as much as begun to sink. Jordan has way too much time on his hands if he can't condense his 700 pages into a more meaningful, active and concise storyline. I have a feeling he gets paid by the word from his publishers. The Wheel of Time just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning yanking its readers up and down like a yo-yo. I will not go back"
1,Tired of this series (read first 5 books),"I quickly read the first 5 books in this series and started reading Path of Daggers some months ago. In the beginning I was interested and couldn't wait to get to the next book in the series. However, I was unable to finish Path of Daggers...since as the series developed, the author seemed to be dragging out every event so that the series has now become boring and repetitive. He doesn't mention some of the older characters while intoducing newer ones. I want to know what is happening to the main characters from the 1st 3 books and I am not going to invest my time or money in 6 or 7 more books to find out. I have become extremely disillusioned with this author and his series."
3,Great series,Love the overall series. Bogs down a bit in here filling in details. Have all of the books in hard cover.
2,The Never Ending Story,"I think this series is misnamed. Instead of the ""The Wheel of Time"", I think it should be called ""The Never Ending Story"". The first 4 books were truly outstanding. Robert Jordan was one of the few authors I could justify buying in hardback edition. Books 5 and 6 were still fairly good, but the story was beginning to get bogged down. This book is the first in the series I didn't like at all. Out of habit, I bought book 8 but the idea of reading another of those 40+ page, boring, and in most cases irrelevant prologues was enough to give me a headache. I'm not reading any more of this series. Sometime in the distant future, if I live so long, this series may come to an end. I'll read the last book just to se how things end up. As for the rest of the books, I'll wait for the Reader's Digest version or for the Cliff Notes."
3,Female Issues?,"If you like books concerning mean spirited, narcisistc, condescending, arrogant, man hating women....then by all means read these books.Every time there is something said by a woman, 9 times out of 10 it's a nasty comment about men. It's very predictable now. When I see, for example, Nynaeve says, ""......text..."", I know it's gonna be something nasty. There is no if's, and's or but's....it will always be something nasty. So I just roll my eyes and skim,or skip through that part. Maybe that's good after all, since it makes the 900+ page book go by quicker.I can't understand how there are actually pregnancies & children in this bizzarro world of man haters.I think Robert Jordan has real female issues. Maybe his Mother was mean, or he got dumped by his girlfriend in High School...I don't know. But the way he portrays women is disturbing."
3,One of the weaker efforts of the series.,"I was ridiculously eager for this book to be published. And then, somewhat disappointed. To my mind, this is the weakest of the series so far.This being said, it is still a ripping good tale. Jordan should be commended for being able to (more or less) successfully sustain such a mammoth story over so many volumes and such a period of time.Although not the strongest effort, again (as with all previous volumes), the plot takes some interesting twists and turns, introducing new characters and new tensions.My fear, though, is that Jordan really does not know how, when, or where the series is going to end. There are an increasingly large number of loose ends which will need to be tied together or the ending of the series will be a disappointment of major proportions."
1,Robert Jordan the Hack,"Robert Jordan is the undisputed hack, and dick tease of fantasy and science fiction history. When reading his books one gets the opinion that he sits at his computer for a year and prints everything that he types in during that time. One of the other reviews of this book suggests that Jordans character development is superior to Tolkein, Tolkein had a thing called subtlty, by the end of the Lord of the Rings one had an intimate knowledge of the characters, Robert Jordan has spent Buddha knows how many pages shoving so much information down our throats that if you didn't know what sort of characteristics the characters had you would have to be a blind monk living in some outer province of Mongolia. Tolkein was a composer who's work is a masterpiece which had brilliant imagery, when Sam and Frodo climbed Mount Doom the reader was there with them. In conclusion Jordan is tradesman who should employ a decent editor to cure his severe case of literary diaheroa"
3,Starts slow...no forward progress.,"Overall enjoyed it. I just wish the main narrative of the story would be progressed sometime soon. 're-reading for the final book to be released this year,2013. Last time I will ever have to do this."
2,"Wow, nothing happens","I love fantasy books and I have been reading the WoT series since the first book. I loved the fantasy action and the whole setting of the first 6 books. However, I think that through the entire book there were very few events of significant value. The first few books were amazing and the plot is fast-paced and exciting. This book slows it down which it rather unfortunate. I hope that the 8th book isnt like that, the Light Willing!"
3,hmm....what's going on here?,"this book was a chore to get through. plot didnt advance very much at all. this series is getting very repetitive, and it seems jordan better either a. pick up the pace, and resolve some of the plot lines or b. end the series very soon, because the way its headed, it looks like its only going to get worse."
2,"No Forsaken killed!, no progress in the story, AGHHHHH!","Well well well,is Robert Jordan going gaga or is it cash tills ringing in is ear.About all that can be said about Jordans dithering is that he is gradually reducing this once great story to an overlong description of the background sceenery.Please please please get the story back on track"
3,get going already - finish the series,"The seventh installment of the Wheel of Time is purely transitional. It lacks the excellence of volumes 3, 4, and 5. Even volume 6, which had enough slow parts to make Frank Herbert proud, had an incredible and thrilling ending culminating with the immortal phrase ""Kneel . . . or you will be knelt."" Crown of Swords has a completely unsatisfying ending and merely regurgitates the plot devices and dialogue of the previous volumes. I read this series when Eye of the World was initially published. Jordan began raising the bar of quality fantasy and looked like he would redefine the concept of the fantasy series. Now he needs to raise his standards and provide a full, complete and satisfying resolution so that this series will not become an afterthought in the shadow of George R.R. Martin's forthcoming classics."
5,One after another... They just keep geting beter!!!,The Seventh book in a series of books that keep the reader in supense from the begining to the end. I loved the series sence I read the first book and afer I got done with book 5(that was all that was out at the time)I wanted to read them again. Now that there are seven books I have read all of the books at least 3 times if not more and I will keep on reading untill Jordan stopes or I Die(the second isn't any time soon).
2,This series seems to have good concepts,"But there're too many of them and they don't seem to get tied together very well. There are too many new characters to begin with and too many new ones being introduced. And with Rand's gargantuan task of uniting all the countries, I have little patience for the unnecessary dialogue and constant bickering.I couldn't possibly care less about how pretty Rand's buttocks are, or how the set of some unnecessary character's nose keeps him/her from being good looking; and I'm tired of reading about how men and women won't ever understand each other and the inevitability of Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene bickering with one another. That bit with Mat and Queen Tylin (another useless character) was disgusting and something I didn't need to read."
2,I loved the Wheel of Time.,"To keep it short, there are too many characters doing too little in the story.It lacks the motion of the first books and is clogged down in too much detail. I think the writer fell in love with his own characters and somehow lost track of a great story he was trying to tell."
5,Can't wait for Vol 8,Great book. I was sorry when it was finished. Can't wait to get my hands on the next installment. I would recommend this series for all. Read every book 3x.
1,Yuck,"I bought this book thinking that it would be as good as the rest. It came nowhere close. The book was difficult to read, full of information that we really did not need to know, and just plain uninteresting. I am going to wait until the last book of this series comes out before I even consider picking up another one of the Wheel of Time books."
2,A piece of crap,I have been reading fantasy for a very long time. At the beginning I enjoyed any piece of trash that masqueraded as fantasy but now I have become more discerning. Robert jordan began his series adequately well but he seems to have lost it along the way. I personally feel that ACOS was just a means to elicit the hard earned cash from starved fantasy readers. This book definately is not worth the paper it is printed o
3,Another step in a great work.,"While this book doesn't contain the same amount of action found in previous books in the ""Wheel of Time"" series, however, I found the book to be as fascinating as all those before.Jordan's writing has matured with his characters. I've reread books the first six books and was struck by the differences in the characters from ""then"" to ""now"". The charactersreally did grow and mature, especially the main protagonist, Rand al'Thor. As we await the publishing of book 8, I think of book 7, not as ""filler"", but as the deliberate placing of charactersand events similar to a game of chess"
2,That's it...,"After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further."
1,Crap,"What the hell is wrong with Robert Jordan? I personally think he should do us all a favour and re-write LoC so that that skirmish at the end becomes Tarmon G'aidon and end the pathetic series there and then! Book Seven was the biggest wank I have ever read and I would have given it a '0' if '1' hadn't been the lowest rating. What is the deal with every single woman being a carbon copy of the next? Who the hell gave him the idea that all men think alike and all women think alike? Why are all the female characters so unpleasant? Being female myself, I want to like them and I want to take their side in the battle of the sexes but why the hell do they keep winning with arguments that hold about as much water as a seive? The worst one of the series so far and I have the feeling this series is going to keep on rolling downhill into the Pit of Doom. Isn't worth the paper it's written on!"
2,Crown of Bores,"I really enjoyed the first three books of the Wheel of Time. In fact I thought they were excellent. Book 5 was horrible, but Lord of Chaos (book 6) was another fine installment. Then we come to book 7. Truly pathetic. Looking for the tight writing and engaging style of the previous books? Looking for some real plot development and character growth? Then don't look at this book. Nothing happens. That's right, in a 700+ page book, nothing happens! The story doesn't move forward. It is filler material, nothing more. Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print. I can only hope that future installments recapture the quality of past ones."
3,great novel horrible copy,"I just love Robert Jordan, however I simply can't believe that the publisher has the gall to charge such inflated fees for digital copies of books available in paperback with so very many typos in them."
2,The Worst of Great Series,"Jordon seems to be wandering through much of this book. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists are further developed. As slow as the build up is, the end comes abruptly just when you thought it should climax, leaving the reader hanging. I imagine Jordon's original draft was too long and the book publisher said cut it in two and sell two books."
4,"Wheel of time, book 7","Robert Jordan in one of the best fantasy series EVER!Item just as described, fast shipping!"
4,"Good, but a little slow paced","I have vastly enjoyed reading the whole series, but it seems we have to wait a very long time for anything significant to happen. I keep reading book after book and am hooked, I will have to read the whole series, but it makes me a little leary of every getting started in another of Jordans future series."
2,"Too many loose ends, vague references and missing characters","Just when things were starting to get really good Jordan writes a mediocre book (Crown of Swords). It almost seems as if he's gotten bored with the series, and such a great series deserves more attention, and respect to its readers. I am definitely interested in the coming book but will not run out to buy the hard cover."
4,Crown of Swords . . . the Lull before the storm,"I felt that Jordan's latest chapter in the Wheel of Time Series was quite intentional in its rythm. As the story unfolds, it begins to tie in the various forces that have been developing since Book One; in each of the books, we notice a few ""loose strings"" witin the storylines. This is perfect! It mimics real-world randomness of events and mixes them with the seemingly fantastic world of the Dragon Reborn. Book 7 is a ""breather"" in anticipation of, what I'm sure, what will be a rich, and fulfilling continuance of a saga few writers have been able to equal."
5,Fabulous,"this is #7 in a series of 13. I was having the hardest time finding it. I not only found it on Amazon, I found a used copy in mint condition at a super low price. The series is a must for Sci Fi readers."
4,Blood and ashes! Way too short...,"A Crown of Swords was as skillfully written as the rest of theWheel of Time series, which is to say the best, bar none,since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy; however, the bookwas not only way too short, but answered too few questions.I also found the end of the book rather anti-climactic...Iexpected a more thrilling battle at the end. For all of itsshortcomings, however, it still was head and shoulders overany fantasy novel I have read since the last WoT book.Until next time..."
2,the wheel of time drags on,"Once again robert jordan shows us that you can write volumesand not say anything at all. Little progress is made again inRand's quest to beat the dark one. Also more charactersare introduced! I would think rj would try to resolve issues withthe ones we know about first. Oh yea, Egwene's little band travels a total 10 milesduring the whole of book 7."
1,Abridgment is hard to follow,"If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version."
1,Trapped in the tower...,"...of about 6,000 pages that never ends. My suggestion is that if you must read this series you check it out from the library. Sure you'll have to wait longer, but you'll be relieved when you're done that you didn't shell out your hard earned cash for a wheel that seems as if it will never stop."
1,That's It - I (Finally) Gave Up,"The series seems to have been slowing down since about book # 3 - but I have kept it up just because I really wanted to know what happened to all of the characters (especially Perrin, who has been neglected). After struggling through this book, I swore not to read any more, to stop wasting my time and to read something with a moving story. A friend of mine bought ""Path of Daggers"", I looked at it and thought ""Why not?"", then decided I just couldn't waste another 3 or 4 or 5 months reading a book I just didn't care about any more. I am one fan he has lost. People like me and other fans got him to where he is. How can he do this to us? But that's ok, I don't even care any more."
2,WOT (Weighty or Tedious) or (Way off Target),"This started out as a great series. Good plot, great characters etc.. Somewhere along the way (to the bank) Robert Jordan lost the way. The series plods along and no progress is made. The characters become more annoying (why is it that all female characters are spoiled, petulant and annoying)? In Crown of Swords Robert Jordan bores us to tears with over 700 pages of drivel to what end. All this will continue while they nail Jordans coffin shut."
3,great story but the man needs to end this...,"This is the book that never ends, yes, it goes on and on my friends. Jordan started writing it not knowing what is was, and he continued writing it forever just because...This is the book that never ends. Yes, it goes on and on my friends. Jordan started it not knowing what it was and he continued writing it forever just because...If anyone has ever watched the Sheri Lewis Show with your children would know what I was talking about!"
3,Good Write /// Bad Read,"I will have to say that though Jordan is obviously a more than talented author, this book was a disappointment as a book in a series of great reads. It makes me want to just go straight to the end of the series and be done with it. I can only hope that the story moves again in #9. I would recommend this book only for the few paltry scraps of intrigue and information that it adds to the series. GO TO THE LIBRARY FOR THIS ONE!!"
2,LETS GET ON WITH IT!,"I have enjoyed this series and, I still do. The problem is simply the flow of the story. Like most of you, I have been reading this series for years now. EVEN A STORY OF EPIC PROPORTIONS HAS TO END!! I am starting to feel like I'm watching old re-runs of Giligans Island or Lost in Space. Rand just can't seem to make it to the last battle. The sad thing is that I will finish this series because I'm hooked. Do you realize, if you have purchased all of the books so far, your into this over $70!"
3,"Well written, classic Jordon but dissapointing story line","As usual Robert Jordon writes in way that prevents the reader from putting the book down and going on with real life (the fantasy is too much fun). I had been eagerly looking forward to this release. I re-read The Path of Daggers so the story would be fresh in my mind. A Crown of Thorns arrived and I settled in to read it.I was very disappointed the story did not progress as in the prior books in the series. Typically, Jordon's books build a complex story around a central theme that coalesces into a spectacular climax. There are problems left to solve but those problems are for the next book.With Crown of Thorns I was left hanging after a great read, as if there were a chapter missing. So here I sit waiting for the next release. Crown of Swords is ""must read"" but like a mediocre meal at a great restaurant, it left me feeling used and more than a little unsatisfied."
3,ALMOST THERE,"I LOVE THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES AND THE CROWN OF SWORDS WAS NO EXCEPTION. I NEVER EALLY GOT INTO SCI-FI & FANTASY TIL JORDAN. I LOVED THIS BOK (ACTUALLY THE SERIES SO FAR) BECAUSE OF THE WAY JORDAN TOLD THE PLOT BUT ALSO TOOK TIME TO CONVEY THE EMOTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS. ITS BEEN SAID THAT THE CHARACTERS WERE ""ONE DIMENSIONAL....WELL EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINIONS. I THINK THAT IF U TOOK THE CHARACTERS FOR MORE THAN FACE VALUE...YOU WILL FIND THAT BESIDES BEING ""ANNOYING"" THESE WOMEN ARE STRONG AND HAVE FEELINGS ANY GIRL IN LOVE AND CONFUSED WOULD HAVE. THESE R PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST FOUND POWER THEY HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THEY COULD HAVE. SO JORDAN MAY NOT BE TOLKIEN....WHOEVER HE MAY B ;) I DONT THINK THEY SHOOULD B COMPARED,EACH AUTHORS WORK SHOULD B VALUED IN ITS OWN RIGHT. I COULD NOT PUT ANY BOOK IN THIS SERIES DOWN AND CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK. JORDAN MAY NOT B ALL TIME GREATEST BUT WITH BOOKS LIKE THESE I FEEL THAT HE IS ALMOST THERE."
3,"Too Much Plot, Not Enough Action,","Jordan's latest book in the series got off to a very slow start, and never seemed to really take off as the others have. The plot seemed to truly get bogged down with way too many details. The novel just didn't excite me the way the other novels in the series did."
3,Where's the Action???,"I realize that Robert Jordan has a daunting task of living up to the expectations of his culminating series of books, but what happened to this one??? I eagerly waited the release, and after a couple of chapters, wished it hadn't been released so early. I found myself fumbling through the pages, wishing something would actually happen, only to be disappointed by more plot and less action. It seems setting up the plot for the next book has its price. But don't fear, I sense that Jordans following book will hopefully recall the action, excitement, and straight out drama the other books have attained. I'm a big fan, and if you're listening Robie, take your time and keep up the good work!"
2,Overly Verbose and Hardly Plotted,"Jordan never writes a paragraph when a chapter will do. Although there is enough plot in A Crown of Swords for a novel, there isn't enough for four, although it has enough pages. I've found myself plodding through Jordan's work before, and normally he includes enough of a plot to keep me entertained, but this book can only be seen as adequate in the context of the series."
2,Two words to where this series is going > BURN OUT!,"Between the constant whining and ramblings of the main characters to the cheap filler in the pages....this book has trully brought what was a great series...to its knees. I hope Mr. Jordan can turn it around and do the last books like the first books....or this series will end with a ""whimper"" and not with a ""Bang"" as it should. Get the story moving again Robert! And lets get on with the show!!! I only hope great authors like George R. R. Martin and others' works don't begin to take a TOO much of a toll on the fall from grace Jordan is taking."
3,"great series , long winded,to long between novels","I must say that it is a very good story, but I find him quite long winded. I'm not sure if some of those book need to be that long. There seems to be a lot of wasted paper.I really think that Robert Jordan is just stringing us along to make more cash. For that reason I'm not sure that I will buy the next one. Like I said I like the story.?!?!?!?!?!"
4,"Not the best of R. Jordan's books, but still good.","This is the latest in a very long series of god books. In any series where the first two books are really good, the following books get harder and harder to write, all the more so for this series where the first four boks were fantastic. I say only the first four because after that no one can agree on how good the rest are, but the first four were great. For those who have been following the series, I don't have to tell you that stopping now would be a poor decision. For those of you who have never read the series, go check out book 1 ""The Eye of the World"", a fantastic book, and you'll be hooked on this series. when you get to this book, however, be prepaired for a small let down. The Crown of Swords seems, to most of the die hard fans, to be half a book. The only explanation i have is that Robert Jordan got tired. It is still worth reading, its just not as good as the others."
3,Still GOOOOOOING...,"I think this is a fair rating...given that this is by no means his best work and an obvious attempt, for who knows why, to delay and carry the story even farther. Still, Jordan is a great writer with a superb mind. If it were not for that he'd probably get a 3 as a rating, b/c as was said by another, one could probably skip ""A Crown of Swords,"" and not even miss it in the saga. Personally, Jordan is one of my 2 favorite writers...the other being Raymond Feist and his Rift War Saga and it's present continuations...if you have not read these do yourself a favor and do it, b/c they will indeed make the time go by as we wait for that cold front to move through hell and Jordan to release book 8."
4,Rand Puts On His Pants And Defeats The Bad Guy,"... and it took 10 pages for him to get out of bed and put on his pants and 5 pages to kill another woman while (almost) killing the bad guy, thus acquiring more paralyzing angst."
3,Jordan pick up the pace!,This book in his series seem to drag on and on. It never felt like you were going anywhere. I kept on saying to myself as I read the book I hope it gets better.
2,Dear Mr. Jordan,"I figure I'm about 5,600 pages into this series and while I've been entertained, I must agree with the other 553 reviewers who range from ""I love it but it's a bit wordy"" to ""For the Love of God move the story!"" I'm begining to feel taken advantage of. I've never read a series that has both entertained and annoyed me so much, which is a testament to Mr. Jordan's emotional connection with the reader. But everyone has a breaking point. After this much time and effort with relatively little payoff, I must encourage all new readers who are thinking of getting into this series to avoid it at all costs. And for those of us who are just too hooked to let go. Here's hoping we all get to the promised land some day."
1,I apologize,"I started this series kind of like wow this must actually tell what happens at the end! I was sooooo wrong. I've always been kind of mad at the end of fatasy books because i want to know what else happens to the characters. Now I know why they don't tell you. I started this series with a shorter story about Lan and Moiraine in a compilation called Legends. So I thought this is absolutely a great series. And i kept up that optimistic attitude for the first 3,000,000 pages but it got old. i realized that I was hanging on for Lan and Moiraine's sake and that this plot really blows! I really don't care about Rand (maybe Mat) And if I wanted a bunch of guy vs girl remarks I'd be happy with the typical life of the American teen.So i apologize to authors(like Tamora Pierce) I got mad at for ending where they did and to them i say thanks you make books worth reading."
1,A Fantastic Journey,Another edition in the Wheel of Time series. Well worth the read. Robert Jordan has picked up where the Lord of the Rings left off. If you like reading a series this one will keep you busy enjoying the creative and fantastic world woven by Robert Jordan for quite some time. Start with the first book and settle in for an adventure that never gets tiring.
1,never recieved,i never recieved this book. nor did the seller contact me after i sent a message trying to find out where the book was.
1,Hi,"Hi!!!Hi again!!! Hi!!! I am half way through this book. It is incrddibly boring and annoying, especially that Elayne. She thinks she's so all that and she's so obsessed with herself that she doesn't know what a [naughty person] she is. I would slap her right now. Bye!!!Bye again!!! Bye!!!"
1,BORING - Insult to the first 6 books.,"BORING, but full marks to Jordan. Not only has he written an epic adventure in the first 6 books of the 'wheel of time series', but he has managed to write rubbish for the seventh book and make a lot more MONEY. That in itself maybe admirable, but what a painful read. The first half of this book recounts the last chapter in book 6. Eight might be my last book if the pace doesnt pick up."
5,When do number 8 come,"It's fantastic, the book becomes better even as you read it.The first book was very good and Jordan has continued hisgood writing. The way everything fitts together isfascinating. Just one advise... Read it ! (at all costs...)"
4,GREAT not the best of the series but great nonetheless,"When I started the series the sixth book (lord of chaos) had just come out in hard back. I read all six books in a little over a month and ended up having to wait nearly two years to read A Crown of Swords. I was a little dissapointed in it because he(robert) left too many loose ends, and it was way too short. The biggest problem I had though, was with the glossaries throughout the series, while they answered a lot things they left way too many things out.ROBERT, PLEASE MAKE BOOK EIGHT LONGER (SAY 1000-1500 PAGES LONG), AND PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE GLOSSARIES"
4,"Too short, but worth the read.","They say never to judge a book by its cover, and that'sexactly how I got hooked on the ""Wheel of Time"". Sittingthere in the airport terminal, it was by far the best of abad lot. Although I felt let down when I finished ACOS,(mostly due to the length, not nearly long enough), I feltthat it still retaines much of the humor and storytellingability that I feel characterizes Robert Jordan's writing.Mat and Tylin'sescapades left me in stitches, and I wasglad Egwain was finally taking control of her Aes Sedai.All in all I was pleased with the book. Although I reallyhope he finishes the series within the next 5 years of so.The waiting months and months for each new book, can't begood for my heart."
5,Endless Scope and Grandeur For The Imagination!!!,"I am a Hardcore reader of Contemporary Fantasy and have been for some years. This whole Set of novels has me screaming for more and more continuation. A person needs for nothing inside the bounds of such an imagination as Jordan possesses.Please Robert!! If you in the remotest chance happen to read this amidst the massess of other praises, please put off the end for another Age of Legends!!"
3,Too long yet I still read them,"This book was not very good. Jordan's writing has dropped off over the last four books and the only thing that keeps me reading is the fact that I am a sucker for a complex plot. And that is one thing this series does have. In book 7 of a supposedly 10 book series, Jordan still managed to introduce a completely new and powerful character, bring back another, and refrain from introducing another major player in the events to come. I can't imagine this series ending at 10. If someone is thinking about reading the series, I suggest that if you like almost any fantasy book, no matter what, read this series. To those who need the great writing of Tolkien, stay well away"
1,Where's da beef,"OK, For those of us masochists that have been waiting for the next installation of this interminable series that started with such promise, please let us know when we can plunk down 25-30$ for the next installment of the Rand 'can't be a man', Mat 'when will he show his real power', White Tower 'man haters' , show"
2,A let-down.,"The latest, and worst of the series. Jordan and his Editor need to go on a long retreat together and get the series back on track.I truly don't mind waiting for a good book. The series can recover from one lousy bookIt can not recover from multiple bad books.Tor has got to be willing to make Jordan rewrite--not just write--his books. And then they have to have an editor who's willing to work to get the series on track, and finished."
3,It keeps going on..and on..and on..and on,"This book is just like all of the rest of the books in this series. Except for one slight problem... In the first book he kills around 3-6 forsaken. In one book. Since then we lose 1 a book. This series will never end. I have gotten so sick of this storyline because there is no denoument. The closure is very important. If I had wanted to read the entire life story of a civilization I would have gone to the non-fiction section. This is, literally, a day-by-day account of these people's lives. He needs to close off some of his ends, stop bringing new people in, and finish the series.James McElroy, Jr."
4,Don't listen to reviews read it for yourself,"To start out, DON'T LISTEN TO ANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON THIS BOOK! Just read it for yourself. To be blunt this ain't the best book in the series but I write a lot and it is not easy to keep coming up with great ideas that we have seen in the past book. Jordan still is writing good books none the less. A lot of people say that nothing important happens in this book. IT ISN'T TRUE! If I didn't read this book I would open up Path of Daggers and be like WHAT? Not to much stuff happens (I could only name 3 off the top of my head) but you should really read this book. It isn't bad it is good. Read it for yourself. For the future Jordan should bring the Asha'man and Aes Sedai closer together."
2,Why so long???????,"First, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. And next, too many twisting subplots to follow. He writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. Ironic, isn't it. At the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the Dark One. I certainly won't. The story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. The first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book."
3,"A satisfactory sequel to ""Lord of Chaos""","I have noticed that Robert Jordan produces excellent books in a way similar to that of growth spurts. One book will excel in it's portrail of the characters motives, depth and the overal plot. The next book will slightyly fail at this while still being a good read. ""Crown of swords"" was this to me. It was a good book altogether but too short in it's length and too lacking in constructive content; as a proper follow up to the Cliffhangers of ""Lord of Chaos"" should be. Now THAT was a good book."
3,I enjoyed this book but the ending left too much hanging,"I read alot of these reviews before I ordered the book, so I was prepared for a book not up to the others. I actually enjoyed it, until it ended. The ending was too abrupt. The great fight set up and then nothing. There were also too many subplots left unfinished. I know somethings need to be left hanging for the start of the next book, but to start looking for the bowl of winds in the previous book and not use it by the end of this one is just too much."
4,not as good as the rest of Wheel of Time,"I read Wheel of Time series II, and I read Tolkien. Admittedly, I am not native English speaker but still, Tolkien and Jordan are two completely different storytellers, both of them masters of their craft: Tolkien of language, and Jordan of technology.I like them both, and will enjoy any book Jordan cares to write. I would only wish that he would spread the action between Ages, and not concentrate on one character in particular."
2,Seemingly endless repitition of known detail,"I loved the first three installments of this series. However, as I plod through book seven, I have grown tired of the endless description of the clothing worn by the characters. The game of thrones intrigues me and I anticipate the coming of Tarmon Gai'Don, but, Mr. Jordan seems forget to focus on advancing the plotlines of his work to review regional fashions. I always eagerly anticipate the next installment of WoT, but this timeI have been let down by a lack of focus on plot development. It seems nothing is ever resolved, only prolonged."
4,"Good, like the others, but stalling the story.","I did like it, like i enjoyed the others, but robert jordan is taking too long to get to the point, a whole book just for each scenario, for each character. it needs to move faster and not tip toe around the events until the end of the book. looking forward to the nedt one which is out, but im waiting for the paperback, incase its more of the usual waiting. i do like the series though."
3,"Still Excellent, but loosing ground","When I started reading this series, (back when book 3 first came out) I was absolutly entralled, and still consider WOT one of the best series out their, but RJ's later books don't live up to the standard set by the earlier ones. In ""Crown of Swords"" the overall plot hardly progressed at all. Still, considering the first 4 book I have hope that the end of the series will be all it's been built up to be."
2,Very Watered Down.,"I have read the whole series so far and I loved the first three books. Most, up to this one, have been good. This installment lacks any substance. The ending seemed like it was thrown together to meet a deadline. Very disappointing. I enjoy a long book, but I feel it should at least capture my attention for some of it. I have talked to a few friends who have also read and enjoyed the series. Most feel, as I, that Robert Jordan has started dragging this out without much thought. I feel the reviews I have read are giving a review of the series, not this book. The series is good, but not this one. One could probably skip this one, and not miss a beat in the series. I'll probably wait for two more books to be written in the series before I start reading again. The books are getting shorter in pages and much shorter in content."
2,The book goes ever on and on...,"Jordan's seventh book adds nothing to this endless stream of mass-market drivel. Most of the people who I know that started the series gave up long ago, as I now have. Jordan's works are written in a manner remniscent of something my D&D buddies would have concocted after an all-night session back in eighth grade - which is appropriate, considering the target audience. Just think, the approximately four-star average review of this book was created from the opinions of those who liked Jordan's previous works enough to drudge through the first six books. Factor in the large number of people who gave up on the series, and the average score would be far, far lower.And please quit comparing Jordan with Tolkien. Comparing those to is similar to comparing the Spice Girls with Mozart, Stephen King with Edgar Allen Poe, or 'Independance Day' with 'Casablanca'.In each case, the former is good clean fun, and a reflection of our time. The later are eternal."
2,Getting worse...,"A Crown of Swords is a wonderful prelude to where this series is going (and has been headed for about 1,000 pages or so)...nowhere.While not as utterly boring as Path of Daggers, Crown does not do much moving, save in the later parts of the novel. The character descriptions are the same as the ones you have read before - the females are all still annoying, braids are still tugged, ears are still boxed, and on and on.Just make believe that this is the last book in a tiring, stale series and drop it."
3,"Hey, Bob! Let's eat the CASH cow!","Enough is enough, already. I'm almost finished with this book, and the story is no closer to being finished than the last book was. Overall, I enjoy the premise of the stories, BUT I want to see an end. I'll wait until the book hits the library because I'm not willing to spend any more money on the series. P.S. My wife gave up 3 books ago!"
2,glad I'm not the only one...,"I glad I'm not the only one with criticisms of these books. I feel a bit cheated by Jordan, I've come too far now not to go to the end with this but the story has really become interminable. Leaving aside the repition (if you took out the word 'stout' this series would be three books shorter!!), infantile breast obessession, utterly inconsistant characters (e.g. strong women characters who suddenly decide they want to be dandled on some man's knee and what the hell is 'dandled anyway')... the thing that irks me most is why does virtually every character insist on jumping to conclusions about the others without a moments thought?I read thiat things getter better from about book 10. I really hope so!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rand has to fight a Forsaken he has fought before, who, in good supervillain fashion, just won't stay down.A quest is also required to do something about the nasty weather that the evil Dark Lord has chosen to inflict upon them.Aes Sedai politics continues to be a pain in the arse for a lot of people."
3,great story but needs less words more progress per book,"I've read them all so far. I like the story I just wish he would use half as many words. Very little really happened in this particular volume. Also, one woould expect by now that the women in the story would have seen enough of the world to lose their obsession with nudity. That gets a little tedious and is a great way to cut out hundreds of pages. Seven huge volumes is really enough to have told the whole story through the final battle"
2,Is he tolkien reborn or a thief?,"Reading all the reviews already entered for this book made me itch to put my two cents in. Every reviewer either loved the book or was tired of the whole adventure. I am very firmly in the latter camp. This story is endless! He's seven books into this story and he's still introducing new characters, he has plot lines that have been open since the first book (Padan Fain for one) and half the characters he's killed may re-appear...ENOUGH! end it already..And for those of you who compare this guy to tolkien I suggest you re-read tolkien and remember that he did it first (And in about 1/10 of the pages"
5,The best fantasy I have ever read.,"This book is great. It provides just enough action to keep you hooked until the next chapter, and the next, and the next... I truly hope that this series never ends. The only thing I do not like is that they come out so slow! But, that does not diminish on the books great content. I would reccomend this book to any and all fantasy lovers, and anyone who does not like this book should have their heads examined. Keep them coming R.J!!!"
4,When did long become a _bad_ thing?,"I just finished aCoS, and while it was good, it wasn't the best of the 7. My bigest problem is the lack of attention to Perrin, one of my favorite characters. Yes, it's a long book, and a long series, but why is this bad? Personally, it's one of my favorite parts. Though, it does remind one of a soap opera at times. The plot moves about twice a book, or once a week. Only with better actors. But, with remarks like ""there are only two times a woman will tell the truth: when she wants something and when the sun rises at midnight,"" how can you go wrong?"
3,"Please Robert, more plot movement!","I have been reading Jordan for quite a number of years now and I have got to say that this book is the most dissapointing so far. The first four books moved right along developing the characters, plot and atmosphere. The last ones seem to have become stagnated and distant to the reader. Jordan needs to recapture the movement that he had in the first few books. He seems to have become caught up in metaphysical and political conundrums as opposed to further plot and character development. The lines have been drawn in the novel and it seems that people are sitting back and pondering their signifigance instead of doing anything about them. Though this was still not a bad read Jordan must find a way to make things more dynamic or he will his readership will sharply decline."
3,Come On Robert,"What I want to know is why is Jordan slowing down? This volume took over a year longer to come out than the other books but it just seems like the piece of Lord Of Chaos that was chopped off. It didn't even have enough action in it. Egwene disappeared in the first part of the book. All in all it tended to plod until the last chapter where the Rand / Sammael fight took place. As it is a year after aCoS and Book 8 doesn't look set to be released until March, I must say I'm disappointed"
4,Why Read it then?,"I'm surprised at complaints as to the length of the series, considering those that complain have also read all seven books. If it's too long, stop reading! (as others have said as well) Personally, I enjoy Jordan's drawn out style (get my money's worth). If you're the kind of person that likes to pay twenty-five dollars for a two hundred page book, fine. I'd rather pay the same twenty-five and get 600 to 800 pages of complex dramatic, humourous, engaging reading."
2,Running out of gas.,"With any lengthy series you must expect some form of deterioration in regards to quality. As is the case with Jordan's ""A Crown of Swords."" But I didn't expect it to fall so dramatically. The editing was dreadful and the plot had little to be desired. Jordan seems to have lost interest in finishing this series or he hasn't been spending the time on this series that he should be because of other obligations. The first couple of books in this series were so good that I literally couldn't put them down. This book was just the opposite. I read it just to pass some time. The only thing that saved this book from getting a zero on my chart was Jordan's ability to make the words jump right out and give me a vivid picture in my mind. Unfortunately I have this need (more like a curse in this case) to finish reading a series to the end. The way things look it seems I am going to be living through a slow death. I was truly disappointed with this book."
5,The best book in the series so far.,This has got to be the best book in the series so far. Although the pace is slower than the others it explores the many plots in detail. The series seems to be getting better as each book comes out (except for the fourth book which was a bit of a dissappointment) and I can't wait for the next book to come out. Robert Jordan has wriiten a fantasy series which I consider to be better than The Lord Of The Rings or any other fantasy series I have read so far. I recommend these books to anyone who likes fantasy.
2,A good book?,The first six were excellent. This volume is a MAJOR disappointment. The next one looks to be the same.
3,It was a follow up on the other six books a little boring,I have to agree this wasn't by far his best but it read well. also he reapts himself and it doesn't seem like he knows where he's going with the series
2,What Happened Here?,"I love Robert Jordan. I read and re-read his books on a regular basis. I got book eight. I cleared a weekend for uninterrupted reading. I opened the book, I thought ""Why did he do THIS?"" I was disappointed that the book did not cover its usual panoramic view of the world where the epic story is taking place. Several of the major storylines were not addressed. (How can you leave us hanging, Mr. Jordan?) The book was short. (I know it is the around the same number of pages, but if you increase the font size and increase the margin width it hardly counts, does it?) I have heard some odd rationalizations for this book. I was told that Robert Jordan was paid almost nothing for the first eight books, but that contract is over and now he is in it for the money. I am not sure what to think. I will buy book nine the day it comes out (I have to know what is happening). But I hope that it is a better book than this one was. It would be an unfortunate end to a truly stellar series."
4,Be patient. It's picking up pace....,"Ok. i'll admitt that Jordan's previos books were getting KIND OF slow. But be patient he's picking up the pace. The other books are the begining of the story, he's getting to the middle. The only reason it's taken Jordan so long to get to the middle is because the plot isn't simple, and because he's a good author. Be patient get through this one and the next. Books 9,10.... are bound to be great books."
4,The best so far,"The best of the series. previous books lacked plot and drive and were often tedious. Again and again the women are stubborn and the men don't understand them, this can get very boring. However there are some excellent ideas and a large range of characters so we all find one we can relate to. I had almost given up on the series before this book but now I eagerly await the next"
4,women are annoying,"Iwould like to say that first of all I am a rather strong woman who considers herself a feminist. If anyone would like Robert Jordan's attempts at creating intelligent, tough women it would be me. Unfortunately, I find his female characters annoying. Women are much more complicated and we don't always gang up against men. I find all the women rather nasty bitches who are constantly engaged in other people's bussiness. Also, if these girls are really country girls they wouldn't be so hung up on sex. My family, until this generatioin, all worked on farms, or owned their own farms. I know from my grandmother and her sisters stories that most people of her era where surprisingly down to earth and realistic about sex. Maybe, probably not likely, Robert Jordan will add some varity to these women in the next book, and make them a little less narrow minded and judgemental."
1,yawn,"This was by far the worst book of the series. I first read The Eye of the World way back in 1990, I was 10 YEARS OLD!!! Now as we enter into 1998 I wonder if Jordan will ever finish this series before the year 2000. I have had to re-read the series each time a new book comes out to stay on top of things since Jordan writes so damn slow. I think I will just skip this book when I reeread the series. Does anyone know when book #8 will appear in the stores? If it isn't better I quit! I have learned I valuable lesson from this series, wait till the author decide to finish before reading."
5,I loved this book,This book had to have been the best Robert Jordan book so far. He is finally managing to make coherent sense and get his ideas across for his story without giving the readers hours and hours of prep and three pages of action. I have to say that I love this series and am eagerly awaiting a path of daggers(the next book).
4,In anticaption for book#8,For anyone who is thinking of starting Robert Jordan's WOT: DON'T....Not until he finishes the whole series...it's torture waiting for the next book. I agree with all the reviewers that thought that Mat's rape scene was not funny. And I also think that Olver is Gaider Cain reborn - did anyone else spot that?
1,What a bore,"As a loyal WOT reader it causes me great pain to write this but it must be done. This book shows what the series has become. Absolutely boring. I had to read this book inbetween my purchases of other books to even finnish it. The author needs to quit stalling to make a few bucks and finnish this series. I for one will not buy anymore in this series till it is finnished, and only then when there arent any of my other favorites out there to buy."
2,800 pages? Should have been 300...,"This book just goes on and on and at the same time goes no where. As a series the books have been great, but this one is a huge let down. Oh, I'll read the next book, because by this time I have invested a buch of time in reading the series. I'm motivated to see how it ends. Lets just hope the books and stories get better. If that next in the series is as pointless at this one I may just give up."
3,Getting bored,"The first six books were great, but nothing happens and I am starting to get bored. I don't even start on number 8 and 9 although I own them. Instead I am reading business books!"
3,a crown of swords,"Where I loved the other Wheel of Time volumes, this book came as a disapointment to me. I think it spent to much time on the weather plot, although it did help develop Mat's character. It had a great ending to the weather plot, but Rand's climactic battle was not so great. Read it, of course, if you are a Wheel fan, but only because. Has some interesting moments but all said, it's the weakest of the series so far."
1,ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am. What started out as an epic, has become drawn out and almost painful to read. The last two books, which I bought in hard back so eager was I to continue the story, have left me feeling used. Is there an amount of books the publishers need Mr. Jordan to write? Mr. Jordan - go back to the first few books, reread them - enjoy them as much as I did and start writing properly again - let the story go on its own - stop holding it back. The series is losing fans - please restore my faith and bring me back."
2,"In this installment, Mat gets laid.","Thrill as Mat is pursued by a woman old enough to have birthed him! Marvel as Elayne, Egwene & Aviendha (or whoever the hell) look for a bowl! Gape in wonder as Elayne finds some old broads who can weild the Power! Gasp in astonishment as Nynaeve and Mat argue with each other! Could it possibly get any more exciting (I shudder to think)?...To be fair, there is a climactic moment (maybe 2) in this book (which is why I grudgingly give it 2 stars) but it happens so fast with no significant development to any major character, it may as well have been a hiccough."
2,Robert Jordan Milking a Dry Cow,"Compared with the rest, 'Crown of Swords' was an unmitigated disappointment. Books 1 to 4 were the most imaginative of this genre that I have read bar Tolkien. Then 5, 6, and 7 emerged which has given rise in my mind that the author is milking this for all its worth.This may be a cash cow Robert, but the milk is getting pretty thin. This 7th teat is getting dryer by the minute. Have pity on yourself, put the cow out to pasture, and find another bovine in your inspired soul for us critics to make a golden effigy with"
3,"A good series yes, a good book, no","I've been looking at what many other readers have written concerning ACOS and I agree with many of the positive points they have brought out. We all love Robert Jordan or we wouldn't have read this far, right? However, let's look at this book for itself. Does the story bring in new twists? Yes. Does it provide a few hours of enjoyable fantasy? Yes. Does it bring us any closer to understanding the main characters? Not really. Does it answer any of the questions we had after fininshing book 6? No. This book is a filler and nothing more. I also dread the day when the series is over and there is nothing more, but that is part of fiction. There is an end. Please Jordan, don't tease us like a high-school prom date! Get to the meat of the matter. Either add substance or wrap it up. You have to be tired of it as well"
4,The series holds this one up.,"This book is the weak link of the series. It is still worth reading on it's own and a can't miss if your are trapped in the story of the Rand, Mat and Perrin.The book ends roughly. It is as if Mr. Jordan was responding to the readers impatience with the release of the sequel. Still, it has the captivation and entertainment value of the series as a whole.My greatest complaint is that the I started the series before it was completed and my uncomfortable fear is that it will be completed and the story will end.Don't miss it but don't be in a hurry, we've a while to wait for the finish"
2,DEFINITE LOW POINT IN THE JORDAN SERIES,"Although a detailed, intricate novel filled with a variety of characters,this one has one slight problem: NOTHING HAPPENS. I thinkthe series needs get focused on what made it great: the maincharacters of Rand, Matt, and Perrin. Then, Jordan needs toconclude the series by getting back the vitality of the earlierbooks. Don't turn this series into a neverending Encyclopedia Brownmystery"
2,BAD CONDITION,"I purchased this video game for about 20 dollars.... mind you it is about 15 years old... not only is the case in bad condition, but the disc is covered in scratches, and it does not even play.. it constantly freezes and I can not even enjoy the cut scenes in the game. The most positive thing I can say is that the game was delivered very fast to me, but it is in horrible condition... I may just stop ordering games from online... this sucks 20 dollars for a game that does not even work properly..and looks like crap"
3,"Good Game, but just a smidgen too hard","This was a great game, but there are some drawbacks. The game is just too incredibly hard for the limited number of lives, and the boss battles (Particularly on the bridge of Immortality) are repetetive. A good game overall, buy it!"
1,This game is the worst ever.,"When I first got the game I thought it would be good like the other mortal kombat games , but then I learned that I wasted my money. This game is extremely hard to beat, has bad graphics, a dumb story , and no 2 player mode. If I were you I would not buy this game. I learned that the hard way."
2,Stick to normal Mortal Kombat,"This is a disgrace to the name Mortal Kombat. Its a near imposible side scrolling version where you fight dumb people and get pat things that fall on oyur head. This is a horrible game and is even wors for Nintendo 64,get it for PlayStation bcaukse the controlls are easy but the best thing to do is not get it at all."
1,Sucks,"Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games.Those being of course,Special Forces and Shaolin Monks.The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place.I guess you could call it a pre-quel.The gameplay is absolutley terrible.The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game.MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences.As many have said,this game is extremly difficult.Hell,I had a VERY hard time beating it,with cheat codes...and with it being on very easy.All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies.There is also puzzle solving as well.Most of which will have you pulling out your hair.Overall,This game is crap and you shouldn't waste one dollar on it.Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well."
5,Cancel my previous review of this album!,"I wrote a review the frist time I listened to this, after being a Tracy Nelson fan for 30 yrs. I was disappointed in all the ""boogie-woogie"" arrangements and only gave it 3 stars. But, I've since listened more and fell in love with it. Tracy just can't make a bad record!"
5,Oh man does this stuff get me feelin' good.,"Oh man, how good is this Cd. I'm a G.Love fan for a few years now, and one thing I can't understand is-Why aren't these guys bigger. I'd say about 6 or 7 of these songs should be released and played on the radio. Love Rodeo Clowns, Numbers, Love, and Dreamin'. Keep on going G. Peace."
5,What a great CD,"This album is a great one from a very underrated band. They are mainly a Philly band but with one more hit will become nationally known. It is worth buying the CD just to listen to ""Rodeo Clowns."" It is an essential CD to fans of all music types."
2,G-Love Gone Pop !,"This album is a huge disappointment.The first album was a classic, but this one just seems hastily thrown together and half-hearted. And G-Love has gone all sugary pop on ""Dreamin"" & ""Rodeo Clowns"". What's goin' on ? Next thing we'll hear he'll be dueting with Britney Spears ! They are a great live band though, but their fat live sound isn't captured on here at all. The best advice - don't buy this album, just wait to see the band live - you'll get better value for money !"
1,No love for G-love,"I am sorry but this CD is really really bad. For those of you who liked his previous albums this really pales in comparison. That song Rodeo Clowns makes me want to... I don't know what, but it is something bad. Do yourself a favor and buy his other three CD's before even considering this one. The word sell out comes to mind... he is on the Sony label now. Hope he gets his act together and gets back to making stuff like ""baby's got sauce"" It hurt me to think that I actually paid money for the CD. Weak G-love, really weak."
2,ok,"OK I will admit I haven't heard a band quite like this in a while. They sound good but the lead singers lyrics are not that good. His voice is nice though, but their kind of music would never get played on tv or radio. No wonder why I never heard of them. The band plays a cool lounge sound but like I said before its a little too unique to really appriciate."
1,CRAP all caps NO punctuation,I keep giving G a listen but just don't get all the hype. There's nothing on this disc worth listening to for more than 30 seconds. This guy should hang it up and pump gas for a living. At least that would be lmore beneficial to the public.
2,Nice but short life,"The device is nice, it allows to use your ps1 or ps2 controller (which I actually prefer) in the gamecube.The problem is it broke just 3 months after I bought it, so this isn't worth it, buy an original gamecube controller, or another adapter."
5,Best accessory for Gamecube!!,"...This thing is awesome. Most of you out there already have a PSX or PS1 (unless you traded in at Funcoland or something), so you have the PS2 / PS1 Dual Shock controllers just sitting around while you play your Gamecube. Wrong!! With this gadget, you can use your Playstation controllers (which you already love using!!) on all your Gamecube games. I have a multitap for my PS2, so I already had extra controllers. Buying two of these is still cheaper than buying one Gamecube controller! You've gotta get one!!"
1,Beware,"The adapter works great, but it won't work for James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire. I contacted the company, and after a long run around, found out that I won't work unless the game company makes it work. So don't be suprised if new games you buy won't work."
5,geat product,"now my friends cant use the excuse ""im used to the ps2 controller"" or ""i don't like the gamecubes controller"" because now you can use ps2 controllers on the gamecube. this is a great investmeant even if you dont have a ps2."
1,Not a reliable product,"I have owned two of these, and both of them over time stopped working and I had to return them. I would greatly recommend purchasing the Wavebird for Nintendo. This wireless controller is manufactured by Nintendo and is without a doubt the best controller I have ever used. I have all three systems,(ps2,xbox,and gamecube)and I enjoy using this controller the most. I like to play about twenty feet away from my t.v. and it is a pain to connect extension cords to the xbox and the ps2. This wavebird works as well as the wired controllers and is wireless. It uses radio frequencies not infra red to you don't have to worry about placement. i just wish the other systems would develop this type of controller."
3,Does it work the other way around?,"I haven't bought this product yet, but I will shortly since I have 2 PS1 controllers laying around. I was just wondering if a Gamecube controller will be able to play a PS2. I seem to prefer the Gamecube contoller over PS2 since I've been playing Game Cube all the time. If u have tried and don't recamend it or anything else that could go wrong with this thing, please just post another review."
4,How does it work?,"If it hooks a completely different conrtoller to a different game system, then how does the button configuration work?"
2,"It works, but... Why?","*scratches head* well, it does work more or less like it's supposed to, though, as someone noted, sensitivity differences can be an issue sometimes. And it does indeed silence excuses like ""I'm used to the PS2 controller."" and ""I don't like the LameCube[sic] controller."" And cost less. For all those things, it gets two solid stars[ 3 for the benefits, losing one for the sensitivity thing]. Yet, I can't ignore the biggest fault. It encourages people to cast aside one of the most comfortable, intuitive controllers ever designed in favor of the most awkward controller I've ever used( admittedly, I've never even tried an Xbox). If only it worked in the other direction. Here's hoping we see a Game Shock, or Game Station, or whatever, real soon( and a Game Box while you're at it..)."
2,Stupid,"My friend said it was a good movie and it ad some potential but the acting was just horrible. This is a movie that i would grade a maybe not a F because it showed it had potential to be a good movie, but a d- because it didn't show that potential."
1,not good,movie was very low budget.silly plot.not very good acting.i give this movie a 1 star.i would give it a zero if there was one.
2,Doesn't deliver...,"Don't get me wrong, I actually like some of these no budget type horrors, so thats not my issue. This movie just doesn't deliver what most of those slice em up slashers are supposed to give you. It just just boring."
2,Not the French band,"This recording is pretty mediocre. It's OK. If you are looking for recordings by the French band of the same name, look elsewhere. This is a different band."
5,What an amazing resource for children's writers!,"I knew that there was a lot to learn when trying to get my first children's book published and I couldn't have found a more complete source in one book. There are pointers and advice given by many published authors. There is a market section where all the publishing houses are listed along with their contact information, what types of books they publish, web addresses, submission requirements and any other relevant information for each specific company. This is an invaluable book for any aspiring children's author."
1,More of the same,"I really like the KoE system, but unfortunately the Devil-tiger book seems to be going into a lot of what White Wolf has been doing lately - let's get more graphic and outrageous when it's not really needed, and we'll sell more stuff. I like the CONCEPT of the devil-tigers, but frankly they go into unnecessary depth. It's one thing to involve violence such as rape in a plot, and say it happened, it's another to actually go and play it out in painful detail. Hope they get better with the next one."
2,EB Pears,"Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away."
1,These jars arrived cracked,"The package did not appear damaged, but it was obviously not packed correctly. I opened up a mess of rancid baby food, with three jars that had been smashed during transit."
4,babies love this!,"I have two 8 mo old twins. The only way they will eat oatmeal is in combination with EB's pear. Very convenient, especially for quickly mixing their breakfast in the morning. Packaging from Amazon is always very secure, never any broken jars. Recommended."
5,The Worlds Greatest,This is undoubtedly one of the most pious works ever written. I simply do not understand how someone could become so literally religious that he/she could devote so much energy to self piety and introspection. I'm not sure that most people could approach the lifestyle of St. Augustine. May we shouldn't even try. This book is an important read for everyone.
3,"Abridged ""City of God""","I was interested in studying examples of spiritual healing in the early Christian Church.I was quite disappointed to discover that only about six pages of Book XXII, Chpt. 8 were recorded, the remaining twelve pages were dismissed by an abridgement statement ""Twelve more pages describe similar miracles witnessed by, or directly reported to Augustine."""
3,Many Fascinating Ideas in Daunting Tome,"I didn't read this from beginning to end, but I was intrigued by the sharp distinctions Augustine makes between the body and the will, and his insistence on culpability for actions lying in the will. Concurrently, he also seems to provide some disturbing theological foundations for Calvinism. I have to applaud him on tackling the issue of how human free will can coexist with an omniscient God, but I nevertheless find his implication that souls are either hellbound are heavebound from the first moment of their existence -- while logical -- a little disturbing."
4,Re translation of COG,"Thomas Merton did many great things in his life, but he didn't ""translate"" the City of God. He wrote the intro for this edition (the Dodds translation). A more up-to-date translation would be that of R.W. Dyson, available at Amazon in PB."
1,The book itself is great...,The formatting is AWFUL. Not the only person who has said so. Sometimes you should believe what you read. Hard to read. No discernible search function. Just plain bad.
2,Mold,Bought this book for class and the text was covered in mold. Working on trying to remove the mold now.
5,City of God.,"City of God is a Beautifully written book,A Response to Pagans at the time who blamed much of the disasters and invasions on Christianity.(History tends to repeat itself)The book as well as Saint Augustine's Arguments for the Church are as Relevant today as they were when he first started writing the first book of this massive work in 410.The book is a Classic. It's more than an Apologetic work,It's a Historic and philosophic book.A Must Read!"
5,CONVERSATIONS... A LESSON IN MALE & FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS,"From the opening conversation which opens the CD, you know that you're in for something special! J, opens up literally breaking down his feelings to that special lady in his life. Then the fun begins with the bumpin' bass line in Ready For Something New which really sets the CD off on fire! Your Love Is Everywhere finds J expressing his love with the help of Two Brothers Recordings Artist, Ricardo, rounding out the backgroud vocals. This track is sung with passion and in earnest. Other stand out tracks for me on this disk are outside, November Rain, and Tell Me Why. With twenty tracks and the Conversations interludes, this is one CD to put in your collection if for no other reason than to get a True 2 Life lesson in ""Conversations,"" You might want to have with the one you love."
4,Good album,Good songs. Raulin is a really good salsero. I grew up on this music. Double album and I still wanted more songs.
4,He also sings!,"This is a very good collection of Yves Montand songs. Many of them have very memorable melodies, which will remain in your head for days at a time (""Trois Petites Note De Musique,"" for example). Several are laid-back, sexually charged jazz tunes, featuring seductive saxophones and that ubiquitous instrument of French music, the accordion. Also very French are the lyrics for some of the songs here; we certainly wouldn't find a song about a cat (""La Chat De La Voisine"") or a bicycle (""La Bicyclette"") in the US, unless it is children's music. Montand might not have the best singing voice or vocal range, though his scratchy baritone lends itself well to this type of music. Although songs range from playful melodies to the brassy ""Coucher Avec Elle,"" the overall mood of this collection suits an intimate evening of wine and dinner with a lover. For those more familiar with Montand as an actor rather than a singer, this music should come as a pleasant surprise. Some very good stuff."
4,A Little Bit Of France,"Montand was always a better actor than he was a singer, but this disc makes a decent case for his vocal talents. He's not one for subtle phrasing or heart-wrenching sentiments (like the great Jacques Brel), but his voice has ambience. If you close your eyes while listening to these recordings, you can almost smell the scent of a corner creperie and hear the noise of a small Paris street. Don't buy this is you want to hear a stunning voice or Brel-type theatrics, but buy it to bring a little bit of France to your stereo."
3,Individual sequences are noteworthy in this collection,"This is an interesting collection in that each film dates from a different period in the Stooges' career. ANTS IN THE PANTRY is the earliest, a fine comedy with the Stooges as exterminators who are thoroughly prepared for the job. A-DUCKING THEY DID GO has an informal bit in which the cast harmonizes on the Stooges' vaudeville standard ""Tears"" (""You'll never know...""); this charming, impromptu bit is the best thing in the movie. THREE LITTLE TWIRPS is the latest and least of this assortment, with the Stooges crashing a circus. Not their best, but Curly is memorable as the bearded lady. Overall, a decent package deal, and as good an assortment as you're likely to see on television."
5,Prime Stooge Stuff,"All 3 shorts on this tape are good--especially the last two. Larry trying to kill a mouse with a hammer, and missing, repeatedly, of course hitting Curly instead, repeatedly. The duck getting the better of Curly, repeatedly. Etc, etc"
2,Madcap Stooges with the usual routine.,"Three early shorts: THREE LITTLE TWIRPS; ANTS IN THE PANTRY; and the best of the three A-DUCKING THEY DID GO, a hilarious duck-hunters spoof that is truly Stooges. Del Lord was one of the directors."
3,SLowly arrived,"Items were in excellent condition however, they didn't arrive when needed....snail mail was the only option and requests to pay for expedite mail unanswered. Had to buy books at school, now we have two excellent copies :("
1,"My opinion of ""Fourteen Hundreds and 91 Days""","I was very dissapointed with this book. I bought a copy for my son for Christmas since he is interested in Civil War history. When it arrived I was shocked to discover that instead of being in print as I had expected, it was a reprodiuction of the soldier's handwriting and his own printing. It was so difficult to read that I doubt if my son ever read it. I feel I wasted my money on that book, and it is rather expensive. Why don't they make a regular printed copy? I am sure the content may be informative, but it is hardly worth the effort to wade through it."
1,Atrocious Book,This book was horrible. I have never been disgusted with any book since Red Badge of Courage. The author had to state in the prologue what the purpose of this book even was as it wasa not clear the entire time. Rosa Lees flagrant abuse of the American system made me even less interest to help the the underclass. The only reedeeming attribute of this book are her sons Erik and Alvin. Would not suggest this book to anyone
4,Rosa Parks,"This book was a learning process for me, I read it for a class I was taking at the time and found how much I did not know about her stuggles in her time of life. Good book for young adults to read."
3,Your Tax Dollars At Work,"This book made me incredibly angry. In a nutshell, it is the horrifying story of one woman's life and legacy of ignorance, immorality, illegality, and vice. It's a very compelling read and well-written in terms of the subject matter, but there is a consistent theme throughout the book of ""failure of the system,"" which I found insulting considering Rosa Lee and her family's grave manipulation, exploitation, and abuse of every helping hand extended."
5,Probably the best look at intergenerational urban poverty,"What makes this book superb is how it examines how what our ancestors did affect our lives. It demonstrated that those trapped in poverty remain in poverty because of a cycle of misfortune caused by the environment and the urban subculture of poverty itself. Professor Dash created such a strong bond with Rosa Lee and her family that he was allowed a real inside look at how the family dealt with their day to day situation, immersed in a world of drugs, prostitution and urban isolation. I had the pleasure of having Prof. Dash in a U of I journalism class, and he truly cares about his subject, and it comes through in this writing. A must read for any student of journalism to learn the immersion journalism technique that made this book a success."
4,8-piece triple star/XZN driver set,"Got these because Audi has a penchant for using every possible type of fastener imaginable on their cars, and I couldn't find any locally. Needed the 8mm and 10mm to install a new seatbelt buckle in my A4, and I know several of the other sizes are used elsewhere in the car, so I'll probably need them eventually. Quality seems fine - while a small amount of the finish appears to have come off due to use, I don't notice any actual deformation, so I'm sure I'll have this set for many years. The fit with the bolt heads was tight and positive, in some cases even requiring a light tap from a hammer to fully seat into the bolt. This is a good thing, as it means the fit is tight enough to prevent stripping the bolt or the driver, and to ensure that torque is applied evenly.)"
5,Well Made Product,"I had my doubts, but as soon as I received the package and opened them up...""Wow"" great set for a great price."
5,Great set VW lifesaver,"Finally found these triple square sockets, thank God. Sears, lowes, Home Depot, autozone, no one had them but Napa, and they wanted $7 for each socket. This is the whole set and they are nice quality. Do all my vw suspension, brakes, and engine work with ease."
5,Great for German cars,these triple square sockets were needed to remove and upgrade the rear sway bar on my 2011 Golf TDI. Thees metric sockets fit the bill completely and will be used many times again as I upgrade and maintain my VW. Best quality and price - would recommend.
5,Excellent buy,Excellent quality tool. I am a 35 year professional mechanic and hate paying high prices for anything that I don't need to. These drive bits are as good as anything on the market but at a down to earth price. I have seen lots of garbage tools in my time and was a little hesitant to buy these tools. I was very pleasantly surprised at the good quality of this purchase.
2,Almost certainly not needed,"I bought this book by mistake because the words ""Solutions manual to accompany..."" were at the time put last in Amazon's title tag. I did get the main book, read that one carefully and found it helpful. The solutions manual, however, never proved useful. It is just page upon page of drab computer printouts with STATA code and sparse comments. Look at the preview pages and see for yourself. I downloaded the sample data sets and redid the examples in R, and found that quite sufficient."
2,Presentation of concepts needs improvement,This booked is packed with information however the presentation needs vast improvement.Specifically the inclusion of a concept map at the beginning that gives a graphic view of hte concepts to be presented. Then concepts maps of each chapter's topics is necessary then. And if possible more concept maps for topics with in each chapter. These concepts would be more understandable with concept maps as graphic organizers of the information presented.
2,Not good...,"The acting is not good, but not horrible. It seems like a college level movie and not professional. The actors seemed like they were forcing the script, so I am thinking that the script was just badly written. It did seem that the script was very rushed. All-in-all, it was pretty badly directed and written with amateur acting at best."
4,Blue House by Marcia Ball,"From a very short piano-'demonstration'by Marcia Ball in a tv-documentary on the history of blues, I had hoped that she would be a blues-pianist, singing a little bit with her piano-performance.However, she turns out to be a singer, also playing the piano, but no solo's, so her playing the piano is 'drowned' by the other more dominant instruments.Stil a very nice CD though.The other 2 CD's which I bought were recorded in later years, and show that she is gradually 'leaving'the blues in favor of 'country'."
1,Should have been -450 stars,I have played a few rotten games but this one was ridiculous. It was one of those games that I would not buy if it was to have cost a penny. I have played the N-64 version and it was great so I figured that it would be just like it man I was wrong. I wish it would have just allowed you to not have a timer trust me this game is not worth it. The graphics are not all that great nor is anything else.
3,Still Waiting...,"I got this game on Christmas day after I got my Playstation on Christmas eve and I was so excited about it. But when I played it, it took such a long time to load:( that's one of the cons the other is the darn timer!!!!!!!! If you get this it won't be the end of the world but befor you do rent it."
3,Rush,"This game is okay, if you like car racing. it's a good game. it takes a while to load. the graphics are okay. it's addictive, depending on where you are in the game."
2,OK...if you can stay awake.,My favorite arcade game has been ruined in the Playstation version. The cars are way too easy to control. It is not even a challenge compared to the arcade. I also had trouble staying awake waiting for it to load each game. Zzzzzzzzzzz. Save your quarters and go to the arcade.
2,great idea that falls short,"the pieces of this toy break fairly easily. While the whole idea is great....all together, they just fall short.Granted, my little boy is only 5...maybe a bit rough on things, but still. The plane is his favorite, the rest just clutter up his room."
2,Not a CD-G,"There are no on screen lyrics, or even backup vocals. The words are in the CD cover. I would not recommend this CD."
1,Stay away from this item,"The clips that hold the mask straps both broke on the first day, and the snorkel had a slow leak. My other mask and snorkel set, and my friend's set are from US Divers, and both are fine. The Speedo set is now in the garbage (unusable)."
2,Paper handling very poor!,Unfortunately if you're looking for a multi-function device that handles paper well don't look here! The main paper handling section mis-handled psper within weeks of the purchase making double sided copies impossible. Now about a year later the auto-sheet feeder has failed. This is not a good purchase for a small office on a limited budget. Even with very low volumes the unit has failed to function effectively.
4,Tremendous underground psychedelic album,"This was one of those albums i held out on trying to locate in a store for YEARS, you know, the elusive album you just WANT to hunt for while rumbling through the stores. Well, i NEVER located it and said to myself, it is time to just go and get this album and see if it meets my expectations. I will say, considering the artist at the time of making this album was 15, this music is AMAZING. The album isn't a classic or anything but the music held within is something to enjoy and if you enjoy psych music ala Beatles style, this will suite you just fine.If you are on the fence whether to go ahead and grab this album,then it is of my opinion to make the purchase. So many great albums went unnoticed during the sixties, it is nice when you can unearth a high quality piece of music worth giving many spins."
5,Suddenly 1972,"I was quite satisfied with my purchase & the checkout experience. The first time I heard this album was the spring of 1972. It was absolutely appropriate then; Now, the same feeling comes back whenever I hear it...! I was very much surprised & impressed to have found such an obscure album in such a quick and simple way. It was obscure in 1972. It brings back lots of memories. I appreciate being able to access such obsure releases.'What powers' at our fingertips! This album was magick then as it is now."
4,remarkable,"this is a wonderful album. what's really impressive is jay kaye was only FIFTEEN YEARS OLD when this incredible album was released. it is orchestral psych for the most part, with occasional horns. FLY really is the best track, but NOBODY, an arthur lee and love sounding song is also great. none of the songs on the album are embarassing or boring. it isn't perfect, but its definitely an overlooked gem of the era."
5,wonderful source of daily spiritual inspiration,"This book is like an angel perched on your shoulder that whispers secrets when you most need them. It comforts, encourages and supports those on a spiritual journey seeking a closer walk with God. This book is Soul Food for the spiritual traveler."
3,Smashing good time,"This game is fun, and has a great arcade feel, there are only two cons 1) the music does not change only one song during gameplay, but you can turn it offand 2) it only has so many levels, with not that many goals to shoot for, so you beat the game pretty quickly.all that aside, it is really fun to play,the way to think of this game is it is basically, one of the big games you would have gotten on midway treasures 3, if it was from midwayso basically it is a small but really fun game, highly recommend you try it."
1,"Painful, pittiful, terrible","Ohh My Gosh. This game [is bad]!! If it was the last game on earth I wouldn't even buy it! Graphics are terrible. Everything else is terrible! Don't waste your money on this game cause if you do, you are pretty stupid. No offense. But really, I'd expect these graphics to be on Super Nintendo! Gameplay is terrible too. My friend brought this game over one time, and we started playin it and after like 2 minutes I said to him, ""Why did you buy this game?"" Someone had bought it for him, obviously the person who bought it for him doesn't have a clue what a mistake they made! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR RENT IT!! EVER!!!!"
5,"Great coverage, an essential reference","If you are a DBA or developer, working daily with databases that support SQL, you need this book. It covers in better detail than any other book I've seen, all the behind the scenes aspects of SQL. What happens when you join, union or correlate queries? How do you know you're hitting your indexes? What new indexes do you need? Unlike most IT reference books, this one should be read cover to cover but it holds up well as a quick reference on a topic as well. Together with O'Reilly's SQL pocket guide by Jonathan Gennick, you have a formidable tool for creating and refining good SQL statements."
1,Never Received Item !,"You asked for Feedback ! I am waiting formy Battery PackBargaincell- 2-Piece Value Combo Pack Of Canon Digital Camera & Camcorder BP-208, BP208 Compatible Li-Ion Replacement Battery with Charger Set- Home Travel Battery Charger + Car Charger Adapter Compatible w/ Models Canon DC10, DC20, DC22, DC40, DC100, E..."
3,good value,"With shipping, this replacement battery was 1/3rd of what it would have cost in a store. Not sure how long it will last, but at least I don't have to get a new phone just because my battery has worn down."
2,Control impedes Gameplay,"Marble Madness is my favorite arcade game of all time. And I owned a Paperboy machine for several years. So I was eager to see how these ultimate arcade classics translated onto the PlayStation console.The results were disappointing. Playing Marble Madness without the trackball is like bowling with a square ball. No control. And without the handlebars, Paperboy feels like a muddled mess.Gauntlet is a faithful translation, but ten years removed from the arcade, the game seemed a little, well, repetitive. It got boaring.that's about it much better off going for ""Pong"", which took a great arcade concept and made it even better."
2,Disapointment,"The controls on this version are horribly incompatible for paperboy, marble madness and crystal castles. Gaunlet saved this pack from being a total disapointment. So all in all you pay ... for one really good game and some duds."
4,"The original Gauntlet, straight from the arcade.","I got it just for Gauntlet, and I wasn't disappointed with this perfect rendention of that arcade classic which emptied my pocket of quarters. The other games are just as faithful, for better or worse!"
4,Sambora is a better solo artist than jovi,"I like Undiscovered soul a lot it's not as good as Stranger in this town, but it takes Sambora in a new direction. It's better than jovi's solo stuff and it has some sad songs on it, Harlem rain being the best. Well worth purchasing."
3,Baby Bop Plush 10 inch Singing Toy,"Sings only one song, but my son loves her. Carries her around everywhere along with his BJ."
3,Somewhat disapointing.,The tempo is fine on all selections. Overall though the best description is VERY BLAND. Does not make you want to dance.
5,Amazing camera,Amazon had the cheapest price (at the time) and the camera is everything I expected and more. I upgraded from a Rebel XT. At the same time I bought two new L-series lenses - well worth the money. I'm still learning all of the features this camera offers. The low-light shots are amazing - the speed is great. I'm a semi-pro photographer and am extremely happy with my purchase - even knowing that any day now Canon is going to roll out the upgrade.
4,Canon 5D,"This camera is superior in almost every way. I quibble a bit about the location of some of the controls. For example, the on/off switch is not in a great location, Nikon has a better location for this on its cameras. This type of complaint aside, which is entirely subjective in nature, You can't find anything better."
5,Amazing Camera!,"First off, let me say that I am not an expert by any means. What I have to say about this camera is from someone who knows the bare minimum about this stuff. The quality of the images both still and filmed are amazing. This camera gets some of the best footage with low lighting that I've ever seen. The lenses are relatively inexpensive for this type of camera and very high quality for the price. I was able to purchase an entire camera package including lenses, flash cards, extra batteries, other random equipment and a case to carry them all in for around $3500. For the professional level product you get with this camera, that price is a steal. If you're looking to get nice looking pics, I'd say stick with your camera phone. If you're looking to take really amazing, professional quality pictures or video, then this is one of the best investments you can ever make."
5,awesome camera poor service,The camera is amazing but to bad the one i received from amazon was defective. I tried to get them to do an exchange but they said they could not replace the item. So i had to return it and wait a month for my refund and purchase it from a local dealer in the meantime for $300 more.
4,"Nice camera, but Canon support is terrible!","I switched from the Nikon D70s to the 5D (I'm a 38-yr Nikon ""system"" photographer, work in all the big museums, MoMA, etc., and dearly love photography). Canon is the better camera, no doubt. But Canon people (as my dealer warned me) have no concerns for the customer whatsoever!!!!!I'm actually thinking about returning to Nikon just to get away from Canon ""support"" ...they'll neither stand behind you or their equipment. This may become very, very important some day. And you'll find yourself left out in the cold.Good camera, bad people.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - AVOID!!!"
4,D300? 5D? Hard choice for every people,"Actually, at first, I wanna buy D300+17-55mm f/2.8G. I think the D300 is a really good camera with a lot of advanced function. But the problem is you have to deal with the crop factor, that's how your 17-55mm become 24-80mm. So when you join in the family of full size sensor camera 3 years later,(the ASP size sensor camera will definitely be disappear) you will find your lens which actually is the most important thing for you can not suitable for the full size sensor, like 17-55mm. Nobody will use 17-55mm on your D3 or D3 mark2, right? So, I change my mind. I choose 5D+24-70mm f/2.8G. That means I do not have to buy everything new after 3 years when I change into 1Ds mark3 or something else.But, you have to know what is the meaning of 5D. 5D is 3 years old. Do not expect too much on some fabulous function. Please just foucs on the real image quality.And do not wait for the 5D mark 2. Everybody knows that the price will exceed $3000 in the first 6 months."
5,Upgrade from XTI,"Probably like most people that are waiting for that ""phantom"" 5d MKII, I couldn't wait no more. The rebate pushed me over the edge. I'm glad I took the plunge. This camera rocks! I'm so glad I upgraded. I'm sure the next version is gonna have all the bells and whistles, but this has become a legendary camera. Everyone has already gone over the specs and likes and dislikes. I just want to say anyone waiting for the new version and wondering if they got this, would they be happy......be assured you will be VERY happy."
4,"great price, small package for a full frame DSLR","I had the pleasure of testing out my uncle's Canon 5D DSLR. Its a little larger and heavier than my 40D, but it is by no means unmanageable. His camera came with the 24-105 f/4 L IS USM kit lens and it made me fall instantly in love with the sharpness and smooth zoom/focus rings. So much so, that I bought the 24-105 f/4 L lens for myself.The 5D is now a few years old, and it was a great camera for its time. While I was super impressed with the features it had, I am holding off on getting this camera only because there has been so much rumors and speculations about the 5D Mark II replacement that is estimated to be released later this year."
5,"Great camera... simple, straightforward, and excellent results","I am an amateur photographer that started with a Rebel XTI and wanted to make the jump into full frame cameras. This camera was so easy for me to get a handle on, and the pictures came out so much better than my already excellent Rebel XTI. I bought it used, I am an amateur and could not justify buying the 5DmarkII. I have had it for over a year now and am very happy with it. I would highly recommend this camera if you want to move to a full frame camera, but do not want to make the investment into the 5DmarkII."
5,"Excellent Camera! Expensive, but worth all the $",I am a pro photographer that has been using the 20 and 40d. The full frame sensor opened up a new world for my photography and lenses. I am especially impressed with the detail I'm getting out of the shadows in my images.
1,Not worth the Price Tag,"I am a camera buff and purchased this camera because I thought it would be an upgrade from my Nikon D300. I bought it from Samy's Camera and it is my fault that I did not get to open the box for over 2 weeks due to a family emergency. When I took it out of the box, it was defective. I took it back and since it was over 2 weeks, I had to get it repaired under my warranty. It took 3 weeks for me to get the camera back and it has never taken clear, crisp pics. The color is off and quality is just not what I expected for the money. I use it just now and then and still have not managed to get a great shot out of it"
5,What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"It's a great camera. My first full frame and I'm hooked already. Can't wait for the replacement to come out. My photos are taking on a whole new dimension with full frame.UPDATE: After 8 months of ownership, this camera simply stopped working. It would power on, but wouldn't take a shot. Wouldn't shot any aperture value in the LCD. I can't even get to the menu. So I sent it back to Canon for warranty repair. It only has ~2500 shutter actuations, so I'm a bit upset that something like this can happen when the camera is practically like new and well cared for (read: babied). It's never been in wet weather and never been to the beach. Though, I am glad that this at least happened while it is still under warranty!"
5,Used this book for a Hydraulics and Pneumatics class,"The book gives detailed information about a variety of topics in hydraulics. Also, has some information on pneumatic circuits as well. It has a lot of formulas, and written to understand them."
2,"The music is great, but don't be fooled","The music/singing is great, just as expected, but don't be fooled by ""2-volume"" edition - with the total length of about 50 min, it could easily fit one CD. Not exactly dishones, but below expectations from Philips."
4,A Good Read,This series focusses on three Wiccan girls trying to make it through normal life while all the while using and running into magic. This series was particularly special to me as I am a young Wiccan myself and to see a book like this that shows Wicca in such a lighthearted and acceptable manner is simply wonderful.
3,Serviceable low-D whistle,"On the one hand, the craftsmanship is not outstanding: on the unit I received, there was a 1.5 mm gap between the left-hand edge of the fipple-block and the mouthpiece, through which air leaked unless I practically swallowed the mouthpiece.But this is a $13 whistle, 1/10 the cost of the next-cheapest low D whistle on Amazon right now. It was no big deal to seal the leak on mine with latex (epoxy putty would have been even better), and even if I were to grossly overvalue my time doing so, this whistle would still amount to a very good value.It has attractive cord-wraps that lend visual interest, and more importantly, has a nice enough tone. Overall, I think this represents a passable entry level into the otherwise-expensive world of low-whistle playing.Note to novices: there's only one way to get low notes to speak on any large woodwind instrument, and that's with very slow air. This instrument is no exception. ;-)"
4,Whistle Review,"I bought this product as a beginner pipe to learn to play until I got better. I like everything about this product. The description was acurate, the price was good, and the shipment was prompt. Overall I am very pleased with this product."
1,Horrible and painful,I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly. I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night. These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor. Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done. These went in the trash.
3,Run Small,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small. I should have gotten a 6 1/2 instead of a 6.THey look good though, isn't that what counts? haha!"
4,Cute,"These shoes are better than I expected. They are adorable and decent enough quality, considering the price. They are a little tight in the toe and I have narrow feet, or so I thought. I went up a size since I fall on a half size normally. I would HIGHLY recommend that others do the same to make the toe more comfortable. Otherwise, they are easy enough to walk in, very cute, and fairly comfortable."
3,Funtasma Shoes,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
2,bad,"The shoes have a really cool look to them. I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits. However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs. The strap came off, like it was just attached with glue. That was a huge disappointment. Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you're buying cheap shoes, expect cheap results..."
3,Disco Shoes,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
5,Fun and flirty,"This shoe is a fun and flirty way to go out to the club or just for halloween, either way they are awesome."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I really loved these shoes when I first got them, but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off. The heal is completely hollow. Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever. I really liked the shoes, but they didn't last more than two months."
3,Cute and fun,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
3,This is No Pitch Black,"I was very suprised that this film really strayed from ""Pitch Black."" That film was exciting, scary, and really fun. I thought another film with Riddick might be fun, but it wasn't a lot of fun. This is an overlong, overexposed, and over narrative sci fi yarn that looked good, but was empty inside. The film made little sense, and took itself far too seriously. Judi Densch must have lost a bet to stay in this dribble that is only saved by some well staged fight scenes and some brisk direction in spots to move it along. The acting is wooden, and the screenplay introduces a lot of new characters, but fails to develop them, nor make them likable enough that we care what happens to them. Only die hard sci fi fans will enjoy, otherwise it still is worth renting."
4,Much better than Pitch Black,"I see some average reviews for this and some even said it wasn't close in comparison to Pitch Black, I don't see that though, this movie was much better in my opinion. It picked up pretty good from Pitch Black, this movie was long so if they walked you through the entire ""5 years"" since Pitch Black it would've been a 6 hour movie, instead they picked up in a good spot.Chronicles Of Riddick has a much better story than Pitch Black, TONS of special effects and eye candy that anyone will enjoy watching, the acting was better, etc. You can tell the budget was a lot bigger for this sequel and it shows. I enjoyed this movie a lot and would recommend it to anyone that likes lots of action and that sci-fi futuristic twist."
1,The Director's version butchers the movie,"The Theatrical version is actually better than the director's version. The story is told in a much better manner.Even the director's version is missing some material. Like at the very end of the movie, the Theatrical version has a slightly longer ending because you'll hear a narrator's voice explaining the conclusion of the movie. In the director's version, the narrator's voice is cut from the ending.The Theatrical version has a few other pieces that are not shown in the director's version.You're better off with the Full-Screen Theatrical version."
2,Mediocre,"Pitch Black was great. It was edgy and had a tight narrative. Director's cut or theatrical cut: Chronicles of Riddick was bloated, slow, and just flat out mediocre. Not a bad movie but average all-round. I don't know if making a PG-13 movie was intended to bring in more of a broad audience, but it definitely lost out on the hard core sci-fi fans from Pitch Black."
3,riddickulous!,"The idea that Diesl is a Furian, was totally unbelievable! The film would have done a lot better if the character Riddick remained a Bad MoFo killer/humanitarian kicking butt and taking names! Vin has got charisma coming out of the ying yang - Plus he's like Arnold Schwartzenegger that can act. That why people go to see his films. I don't think he actually made a ""really"" good flick since Saving Private Ryan and Pitch Black. Sorry mate, but you know I'm right. I think Pacifier is probably the kind of Genre that he should stick too, until he can find one with a good script and a good action genre (together).Acting - 3Action - 3.5Believability - 2Time given to go pee pee - 4(not good)First date movie - 2Total - 3"
2,Rent before you Buy,What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie. I fell asleep half way thru this bomb and didn't want to waste another 3 bucks renting this a 2nd day to finish it.
5,NOW THIS IS A MOVIE - WORTH SEEING AGAIN,"Action - in all its glory. Color, Weirderness - strong characters.Why did we have to lose Riddick's friend. Riddick was back full force with his intimadations and strange powers.This is definitely a keeper.Definitely Recommended [director's cut version] Wow!"
1,"Wow, what a letdown!","First, let me say I REALLY liked Pitch Black. Great movie. This sequel, on the other hand, was horrid. The graphics were pretty decent, and there was a lot of action.....however, the plot, if you could call it that was weak. Necromongers? Underverse? You have got to be kidding me. I put this in the category of sequels that should never have been made, alongside Speed 2, and Mad Max:beyond the thunderdome. All three of these were movies I enjoyed, followed by sequels that were a real letdown."
3,Adventurous,"Not as strong of a story. More of a formula movie. Good visuals, but Pitch Black is the better show."
3,"Goggles, goggles","I like Vin Diesel. I think he is funny, not yet an actor, and with the kind of movies he gets, he wont ever be. The Chronicles of Riddick is what I call a ""giggling movie"". You just keep giggling, somewhat in embarrassment that you are watching such a silly movie being an adult yourself and somewhat enjoying the bad acting all around (Oh, my, the Lady Vaako wants to be mephistophelian, and she is only silly, silly, silly) and the statues, and the fights, and the incomprehensible story. Did anybody really understand what was going on? And why didnt someone give Riddick a comfortable pair of goggles, so he didnt have to be puting and taking them away three times a minute. Ayway, it was nice for a nothing-to-do afternoon at home."
1,Not the theater release!!!!,"I enjoyed the theater release of this movie. I HATE THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!<spoiler>In the director's cut Riddick has visions of his home world and some angel like character gives him super natural powers. In the big fight as they are escaping the prison Riddick is basically defeated, then a miracle happens and some magic energy shockwave comes out of Riddick's body and knocks down all the baddies. LAME!!!The theatrical release had none of this BS!</spoilers>Worse, Amazon has this MIS-LABELed. It does not say director's cut above. The only place that says that is in very small print in the image."
4,RIDDICK RETURNS BETTER THAN BEFORE!!!,"it's hard for a sequal to get anywhere near as good as the first one, or in some cases surpass it as well. well this one almost did for me. pitch black and the chronicles of riddick are both so different, but are still along the same lines. the chronicles was very good, i didn't think it was going to be such a big deal, but i'm glad i was wrong. vin diesel, does what he does best. the big action hero, with an ""i don't care about anybody but myself"" attitude returns for some more. he's a great actor, and these are the kinds of movies he should do, because all eyes are on him the whole time. the follow up story was good as well. a few years later he's back and only he can save the world. he meets up with an old friend, and together they must beat this leader of the half dead necromongers. he finds love, but at what a cost. in the end good must prevail over evil. great movie, fantastic scenes, and riddick does it again. i want more."
4,Ok Action but don't look for great acting,"Vin Diesal has made some pretty good movies (Boiler Room, The Fast and the Furious, XXX). This unfortunately, is not one of his better acting efforts. The story has a lot of action though and some of the fight scenes are good. Diesal's character is has a smug attitude that sometimes makes it difficult to root for him. He does have an intimidating pressence that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.The special effects are not high tech but they seem good for what they are. There is some narration at the beginning that is important not to miss because, without it, you will have a hard time following the story. Overall I would give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,RIDDICK,"I must confess, this movie is a guilty pleasure. I mean just to see Diesel and the great Judy Dench in the same sceen is worth the DVD purchase. This movie is very well done, the special effects are first rate and the story is fascinating. I had not seen Pitch Black so i was a bit lost at first, but the movie gets you up to speed quickly. I didnt go into this movie expecting much, so i was shocked at how well i liked it. The DVD extras are good, they explain some of the back ground on the characters and locations, which i appreciated, because the movie moves fast. Highly recommended, especially if your into sci fi, though frankly if you are, you've probably seen this movie a million times, verdad?"
2,My Speech Impaired Child Writes Better Dialogue,"I am giving this two stars instead of one beacuse Judi Dench is in this. She can belch with dignity and class, which is what she practically did in this movie.Thandie Newton is a beautful woman but she should never be allowed to open her mouth to speak when the writers are so inept. The movie is full of contrived cleverness and weak attemts at wit. It is cliche and my teenagers were laughing at it, mocking scenes. ""Oh, here's the sexy prisoner! She can't fight, but she can sure talk tuff and hide blades on her body!""As much as I hated the movie, the director's note and additional information made it interesting in how they shot it and how they created affects. Still, save your money and buy HellBoy, instead."
5,awesome,i loved this movie. i liked pitch black allot but i never thought this would be better. it was awesome and i would have paid to see it but i had the free ticket that came with my pitch black DVD.
2,What a painful movie,"I saw Pitch Black in the theaters when it came out, and was blown away by the character development and story, I thought it was the best sci-fi movie since Alien. Intelligent and engaging, two words that can never describe this mess.This movie is so painful to watch in light of the superior Pitch Black. A clunky storyline, with some of the most embarrassing lines ever to stain a movie. The FX is very good most of the time, but good FX does not make for a good movie.The ""plot"" has been rehashed over and over so I will spare you. Riddick was a very interesting character before this movie. In this movie, he is turned into a shallow superhero with a bad attitude. Yeah, I know he changed at the end of Pitch Black because of ""the captain"", but this is not the same character at all.If you are in the mood for a mindless action flick, this will probably serve you well. If you want a well written, interesting movie, look elsewhere."
3,Let's have a part three!,"Although I liked Pitch Black more because of its darker nature, Chronicles of Riddick is absolutely an entertaining movie to watch. It is a little disturbing that the character of Riddick was changed into somekind of SF Chuck Norris, but still the movie holds together very well as the special effects and the costumes look impressive. If they could find a director that is able to return to the atmoshere of Pitch Black, I even think there could be a succesfull part three. (SARR)"
4,Better than I expected,"This film was much better than I expected it to be, it was an allegory if I ever saw one. Vin Diesel seems to be getting better as an actor through films with more depth than merely explosions but this at least has something for everyone in it. I say give it a shot."
1,Riddick-ulous,"Vin Diesel is confirming his status as the Steven Segal of the 21st century. This movie is a hot mess!! Vin is supposed to be an hunted anti-hero in this sequel to the hit ""Pitch Black"". He's a former prisoner caught between warring forces in an all-galaxy mega-battle led by the powerful Necromongers. Vin learns about his mysterious origins (he's the last of his breed) and faces off against the leader of the Necromongers with the future of all beings hanging in the balance. Whatever!! Anyway, this movie feels like its 5 hours long. Its an overheated and over-rated spectacle. Go see it if you must, but you have been warned."
1,Riddickulous,"Lame, tedious, uninspired. Generic plot, hokey final confrontation and woodener-than-a-hockey-stick ""acting"" from the Vinster. No fun."
1,Bunch of one liners...,"Maybe it's because i didn't see Pitch Black...but this movie made absolutely no sense to me. There is no real conversation ever just a bunch of one-liners from Riddick. Lots of people (guys I think) like this movie...but if you care about plot, story, characters, I do not recommend this."
5,SLICK....,"This sequel-of-sorts to Pitch Black finds Riddick (Diesel) arriving on New Mecca, there to battle an invading empire of Borg-style Necromongers (!), aliens who seek to eradicate the entire human race. If it's slick, stylish and slightly bonkers sci-fi you're after, this one will fit the bill."
5,Riddick - awesome,Great futuristic action flick with awesome sound. this is definitely better on a big screen. Great part of the trillogy (Pitch Black + 3rd one coming out 'soon').
4,Good action film with plenty of special effects.,"Good action film with plenty of special effects. Film moves a long evenly with no gaps in action and plot? Decent enough. Dialogue, acting, ok. Of course this builds on ""Pitch Black"", which is also a good action film. Riddick is an interesting character and actually one I like although he is a ""bad"" guy to some. Recommend for action, effects."
4,A must have for your Sci Fi library,"Great Sci Fi movie and story. As is the case with many sci fi movies, the weaker acting is a bit of a distraction but the solid story and exceptional special effects easily carry the viewer through to the end. I was tempted to upgrade to Blu-Ray but the widescreen DVD is exceptionally sharp, rivaling SuperBit and THX transfers on the high def screen. The additional footage of the director's cut definitely adds significance to the story. If you keep a Sci Fi movie library, The Chronicles of Riddick is a must have."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is the sequel to Pitch Black and wow, was it good.My husband and I watched it together and we were both thoroughly entertained by the effects, the characters, and the storyline. Although there were some parts that I thought were just plain silly like (SPOILER) Riddick and Jack trying to prove who was the better killer (END SPOILER SECTION), overall it was a good movie. Not a deep, oscar-worthy movie, but good enough to watch and recommend to others."
4,Worth it,"Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series. Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film. It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder ""why...?"" Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is. The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making. The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films. Vin Diesel is great. Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive. He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language. Actually, the action films I own are for watching while I exercise, and this is one I have watched more than once and will undoubtably watch again. Its a good specimen of its' genre."
2,Mixed feelings about this movie....,"I did not like the storyline in this movie as well as ""Pitch Black"". Although, I have to say the special effects and visuals in this movie are awesome! I watched it the one time, and that is all I care to watch it; unlike Pitch Black, which I have watched several times! I liked a couple of the characters in the movie, but overall, the story just was'nt as good as I would have liked."
4,popcorn fun,"I went to see this movie with relatively low expectations, but ultimately found it to be above average sci-fi fair. Does an effective job of balancing special effects and production values that are superb and a story that is actually pretty promising given the clear ambition to make more than one of these movies and dialogue that is highly stylized and hyperbolic.Not the most cerebral movie you will see this summer, but... you know... it's summer time people. And this is an involving piece of escapist entertainment, somewhat silly premises are par for the course."
1,15 minutes of disappointment,"I Saw this movie in the theater and loved it, the surprises and revelations about the characters came at the right times to catch those swept up in story the off guard. This unrated directors cut reveals too much to soon, and reveals the obvious too late. If you haven't figured out who caused the massacre on Furrian by the time this version ""reveals"" it then you've been napping. The scenes showing the decimated planet Furrian and the accompying explanations by the ""ghost"" weren't only irrevelant but annoying and detracting from the original story. I'll be returning this movie and buying the original theatrical release. Hopefully I'll be able to forget the dreadful added 15 minutes."
5,Best kept secret of the summer,"If you enjoy sci-fi movies and don't watch this movie this summer in a movie theater, you will never forgive yourself. Here's why:- The movie is entertaining to the core- The dialog is fantastic and Vin Diesel's delivery is perfect- The special effects are superb and are artistically done- The special effects are fresh and not a rehash of effects we've seen a dozen times already- The plot is engaging and well-planned- The pacing is great: it's not boringly slow and it's not mind-numbingly fast- The landscapes are great- The digital wolves are fantastic- The costumes are superb- The heroine is beautiful- Vin Diesel's sparkly eyes and his deep voice are great- Vin Diesel's acting is restrained and therefore respectable: he doesn't go over the top and serves the story well.- It's written and directed by the same guy- Vin Diesel was born to play this role - he's that good in the movie (and this coming from someone who's not a particularly big fan of him)"
4,Riddick,Own this movie on standard DVD and always thought it was visually stunniing. The blu-ray is out of this world. I use this movie to show how clear blu-ray is on my HDTV.
4,"Decent movie, great art direction","This movie was better than I thought it would be. It's not as innovative as Pitch Black, but it is more complex and has a great look. Excellent effects and art direction."
3,Reveiw,Item was in great shape. I didn't get it for almost a month after ordering but other then that everything was well done.
1,KILL RIDDICK... PLEASE!!!!,Another pathetic excuse for a movie. How is Vin Diesel still getting movie deals? He should go back to doing whatever he did before he starred in movies... at least that way his horrid acting didn't corrode the young minds of americans.
2,VIN WEASEL,"This movie had decent special FX,but bored the hell out of me! Theonly good movie Vinny was ever inwas, Saving Ryans Privates. DoesVinny have down syndrome? It surelooks like it!"
1,RIDDICK IS RIDICULOUS,"THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK (Universal) is the follow up to the superior ""Pitch Black."" While watching this seemingly endless mess, I realized ""Riddick"" must be short for ""ridiculous."" Vin Diesel's back as the interplanetary anti-hero. Dame Judy Dench was somehow talked into taking part as well. Huge scenes with lots of action and inventive CGI effects are meaningless when the plot (and I use the word loosely) is undecipherable, the characters unbelievable and the set-ups are often not paid off.A waste of good pixels."
2,"strong visuals, weak everything else","In this top-heavy and bloated sequel to ""Pitch Black,"" Vin Deisel plays a top-heavy and bloated antihero whose job it is to defeat an army of half-dead warriors bent on taking over the universe.At 135 minutes, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is an interminable m√©lange of derivative mythology, mind-numbing dialogue and uniformly wooden acting, made bearable only by the breathtaking design and look of the film. Diesel sleepwalks through the part of Riddick, barely managing to sputter out even the few paltry lines of dialogue the screenwriter has seen fit to assign to him. About the only point of interest in the otherwise dull and tedious enterprise is why the classy Judi Dench chose this particular neighborhood to go slumming in."
1,Flush this smelly turd down the toilet.,"Im just going to get to the point here.Chronicles of Riddick is an awful movie. Why you ask? Because of the bad acting, cliche' story and action. Ridiculous one-liners and acting. Basicly, bad everything. Bottem line is this, CoR is a realy bad movie. Avoid seeing, I mean suffering through it at all costs."
4,(:D) ....ok,"This is not a great movie but I certainly enjoyed the ride, the effects and the awesome costumes and scenery. Thandie Newton steals the show along with Colin Fiore......check out his great costume. Just accept it for what it is and enjoy.IF u ask me though i think the game is way better while i give the movie 4 stars the game for me is 5"
3,Stupid - Funny - Cool,"This movie had alot of Cool effects. It had a touch of Goth with a touch of nuts in space. In my life I would of never of thought to use Living dead people(thingys..?) as cell phones, Or using monkeys in green fish bowls as detectors. (lol) The FX was way cool. This movie in years will be right up thier with ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"" BTW has better dialoge than Riddeck. But for those lookin for a touch of *Way beyond normal Sci-Fi* I would say ""knock yourself out""."
2,hm,"I would say that the only thing less interesting than the movie itself were the special features included in the disk.Ok, there were definitely some cool action scenes. However, there was little to no character development. The story and subplots seemed to have been ripped off from a bunch of other stories (including the prophecy and the killing of the sons--read mythology much?). The motivations of the characters seemed somewhat random and irrelevant.This dvd was given to me as a gift. I would have never purchased it myself (had I seen the movie). I think this movie is worth watching once, and that's about it. No point to owning it."
3,"""Sucked, But In A Good Way""","What I mean is this film is one of the best action films of the year, and I'm not comparing this to Kill Bill. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" has no character development, no plot, in fact the video game is way better. In fact all Vin diesel does is trash talk, show his muscles, and adds no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll add a third intallment, so I can find out. This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action. ""Kill Bill"" showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all. Why can't we get the same treatment and let it be entertaining as well."
4,Hd-DVD winner,"I received this one as one of my free Hd movies, and it's an action film, sci-fi film winner. Excellent sound and crystal clear picture. I hadn't seen this one in a long time, and I must admit that the Hd movie experience is fantastic on this one. I liked it a few years ago, but love it on on HD."
3,Regret not seeing it in the cinema,"Director Twohy fancies himself a bit of an auteur. I wouldn't go that far (Dune/ Farscape, et al) but his idiosyncratic style rather won me over. I'm not sure if the character of Riddick (from Pitch Black) ever justifies the portentious deification Twohy affords him, but the possibly tragic ending is none the less intriguing. Beautifully shot, the story dares to be dark although I fear it may be too lumbering and lugabrious to withstand too many repeat viewings. I do think it was a mistake to recast Jack. The original actress had huge Bambi eyes and it's difficult to connect emotionally with a different actress. Finally, watch out for a cheeky Roy Batty/Rutger Hauer tribute scene."
3,Tries too hard. . .,".. to be an epic sci-fi movie. I had mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand, it's great to see Riddick again but I preferred the Riddick from ""Pitch Black"", rather than his incarnation of ""super hero called in to save the universe"" In ""Pitch Black"", he was the ultimate bad ass, but still a human being, albeit a deeply flawed one. In this movie, he has almost super-human powers it seems, able to mow down dozens of Necromongers at a time. As for the look of the movie, a bigger budget doesn't necessarily mean a better movie. Everything is on a grand scale and some of scenary is awesome (but some isn't so great). Also, the two other surviving characters from ""Pitch Black"" are killed off in this installment, one early on, the other at the end (boo!) All in all, Twohy should have taken much more time to tell us this story (2 hours plus a few minutes just isn't enough), too much is crammed in. And of course, the end leaves us open for (surprise) another sequel! Imagine that!"
5,A new universe is born.,"This movie really captures a world, or perhaps I should say a universe, and makes it come to life unlike any movie I've seen since the Matrix. It is complete with never before seen characters, planets, and civilizations. Ultimately, it is a tale of dark conformity and religious tyranny and the one man, Riddick, who resists it. The film actually probes deeper issues--and rather symbolically at that--and this makes it more powerful. The best aspect of the film is that its tension keeps building up to the final crescendo. The ending is most unexpected and awe-inspiring."
4,What are you talking about??,"I dont understand what most people are talking about. Sure its not the same as pitch black, but just because its different doesnt mean its bad. If anyone who is an anime and manga fan should definitly check out the movie. The fight scences rocked and the settings of the movie really show its dedication to art. If you like your action fluid and up-close, definitly watch it."
3,Not bad.......but not good,"Though I found The Chronicles of Ridddick seemed to be a good idea when first heard about, I found the execution to be lacking and was sorely disappointed. The concept is great, but there are so many plot holes and the characters are so uninteresting that I could have cared less. It seems to be a wasted effort, though I appreciate the ambitious storyline. The whole thing seems to come off as mediocre at best. I thought it could have been done much better and they COULD have achieved the original grand sci-fi film that they were hoping to make, which would be nice considering how many movies these days are rehashed from comics and books. Perhaps the DVD release will make up for what the theatrical release lacked. Better luck next time guys."
3,Not for the uninitiated,"I had never heard of this movie before I saw it in a store. I already had a handfull of choices and I was stocking up for travel. I saw the cover and thought I might enjoy a sci-fi action movie so I bought it.It was a mistake FOR ME. Apparently this is a sequel and I was missing out on the origins of the story. The definitely handicapped my understanding and enjoyment of the events protrayed. What I did see was a fairly lavish action movie with some great lines and some great stunts. It meant very little to me, however. I think I need to see the prequel to fully appreciate it.You may want this movie but you should want its predecessor first."
4,Riddick,"I'm sorry that this review is not about the movie. I was on a trip when it came out and by the time i got back my theaters weren't playing the movie. I gave the 4 stars for the trailers. This review is however about Riddick. All the critics are not realizing there is nothing wrong with his character; this is how he was meant to be from Pitch Black. He isn't big on talking, he will kill anyone who gets in his way. From Pitch Black we saw this, but we also saw that he isn't a cold blooded murderer because he wont kill the kid to save himself.I hope that this review was useful for anyone who didn't want to see this movie before because they thought the character was weak."
3,Perhaps not what it is supposed to be.,"I didn't watch this video and my review is based on reports from my son for whom I got it. He suggests I save my money in the future. This video has slight appeal for him and I gave it 3 stars because he has a generous nature. If this is the kind of thing you like, take a chance on it. One who viewed it said it was passable but nothing special."
4,Fun,"This movie is definately not the best flick of the year. I give that to I ROBOT. But, hey, it sure was fun. Nice special effects and frequent action scenes make this movie very enjoyable to watch. Sure, there was some REALLY REALLY corny dialouge (""It's an animal thing!"") at parts, but I still loved this movie, along with the first Pitch Black.I give it 4 of 5 stars!"
1,Tied with White Chicks for worst Movie of 2004,"How many science fiction and fantasy cliches can you put in a movie? Just watch Riddick and start counting. I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD. Pitch Black was great but for this ""sequel"" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie. The acting was laughable. The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars, Star Trek, LOTR, Escape from New York, forget about it. I don't want to continue listing because I think you should get the point. Don't waste any $$$ or time on tis steaming pile of crap. You might as well call Vin Diesel's career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme. Straight to cable and DVD."
4,An Entertaining Mess,"I won't go into detail, but this sequel to the sleeper hit pitch black is a bit muddled because of so many characters, places, and subplots simply making it too much, but it does have it's moments(death by teacup). Hopefully the sequel will correct these issues because after that conan ending, I'm curious as to if they have anything special in store."
3,Good popcorn movie...,"I would say that Pitch Black, the low budget original classic is much better than TCOR. This movie is a large budget attempt to re-capture on a sequal. I reminds me of Fast and the Furious vs Too Fast Too Furious. Boy stick to the original first movie. But the sequal is only a rental. I would say Dark Fury is worth the price though. These new in between DVDs are more interesting and fun."
5,GREAT! BEST OF ITS KIND!,I just recently watched this movie and I enjoyed it very much and that is why I am writing my 2nd online review ever! I only write online reviews for things I feel strongly about. If you enjoy movies like Pitch black combined with Star Wars ... then you will really enjoy this one. To me its a must have!!!!
5,Brilliant collection!,"If you want a compact collection of the best works of Astrud, this is it. This album has been played zillions of times in many situations in my life. It is hard to find an album with so much talent and passions. Astrud has not only influenced the jazz world, but many rock artists such as Stereolab, Yo La Tengo, and Broadcast. If I could take an album in my afterlife, this would be a sure one!"
1,Please...,"If you want to capture the true spirit of the bossa, buy ""Amoroso/Brazil"" or ""Joao"", by Joao Gilberto, and don't waste your time and money with Astrud, who made a career out of a casual invitation from Getz to sing in Getz/Gilberto, to which Joao Gilberto and Tom Jobim objected fiercely (these guys ""created"" the bossa nova...don't you think they would know better than you, who don't even understand the lyrics?)."
4,Prankster n chief,"If you've followed the man and his work as I have, this book is a trip.The book arrived in timely fashion and was a good way to use some of my AMEX points for purchase."
2,Didn't finish reading it,I tried to skim it since i had skimmed the first one but just couldn't get into it at all. the first one was hard enough to read but as i had bought both of them i wanted to give it a try. i couldn't finish it or skim it. the writing didn't flow and was very difficult to read.
5,Incredibile!!!!!,This is one of the all-time best CD's. EWF was my 1st concert ever and subseqently saw them 3 other times. Gratitude and Interlude are the cd's best tracks. Maurice White's voice is pure magic!!! This is a must for any EWF fan.
5,IM GIVIN GRATITUDE!,"People just another example of why i love live music when it,s done right!.Forget it,s ewf that alone would sell this cd.Just can,t get over how goooooooood this sounds 30years later.You will enjoy!"
5,"The Summer of Fun ""74"" Do you remember?",I've been looking for this CD for about a few months I use to have the album. I'm showing my age but what a age to live in the wonderful 70'd. I blast this classic cd and you should hear it with the bose system wow. Love the E.W.F. a true fan and looking for that sound once again.
3,A good video for a how-to breastfeeding class,"THis is a good visual video that can be used as part of a pre-natal breastfeeding class. It is not for a new mom to buy for herself, in my opinion. You can find the same info in breastfeeding books. It shows good attachment and positioning of babies at the breast."
5,Now that's a knife fighter,I have to say MR. Webb's Dvd was a great teaching dvd on knife fighting . He really goes into great details on many great styles of fighting. He also mentions that you will most likely get cut during a knife fight. All the other dvd never say that and never prepare you on what to do about it.Mr. Webb covers almost all aspects of knife fighting in a real and easy way for anyone to learn. I highly suggest everyone who wants to learn about knife fighting get this DVD.
3,A good basic guide,"These audubon guides are good basic guides. We got them to identify butterflies, insects and spiders in our midwestern back yard. It is often difficult to find the bugs we are looking for. We've had much more luck with Kenn Kaufman's ""Field Guide to Insects of North America"". In some ways it's more user friendly, with lots of bugs photos on one page and descriptions that are on the opposing text page. The Audubon guide is set up so that you have to flip back and forth between images in one section and text/description in another - which can be tedious - however, the Audubon descriptions are much more thorough than Kaufman's."
3,"Very good, but where are the maps?","Author Robert Pyle's butterfly cred is impeccable, and the photos are mostly very good, but I was disappointed to find that this guide lacks range maps. This is a serious omission in a field guide. I find it useful as a reference (e.g., the info on larval host plants is good to have), but not so much as a field guide."
2,Written in Legaleeze...got a better book for you,"Read ""Beyond the Grave, The Right Way and the Wrong Way of Leaving Money to Your Children"" instead of this book or before you read this book. I bought both and gave up on this book after a couple chapters. It was a struggle to get through. Very dry, written like a tech manual, a real sleeper. Go read the reviews on Amazon for Condon's book before deciding which one to order. Trust me, you want the other book."
5,Excellent!!!,"The Cmplete Book of Trusts is an excellent reference for general knowledge about a very cmplex subject! I highly recommend this book to anyone with a need to know. This author has managed to take the ""legal"" language and break it down into understandable English!"
2,TOO OLD,"It was last revised in 2002, that's twelve years ago. Need I say more for such a fluid topic. oNE MORE WORD."
4,Good book for basics of trusts but it dated in some cases,Good book for basics of trusts but it dated in some cases and and and and and and and and
3,"Misleading to call it a ""Complete Book""","Yes, it is a good book and it is helpful to anyone who wants to have an insightful look at the subject of Trust. But by no means it is a ""complete"" book. It does touch upon various types of trusts, but for most of them the discussions are very brief and hardly point you to the direction for further study. If not for the title, probably I could give a 4-star."
2,slow and repetitious,"Having made it to page 88, reading through several repetitions and reminders of character's abilities or facts, I began to wonder whether this would continue. So, I flipped to page 336 and picked up from that point without skipping a beat...or boredom. Needless to say, I did not finish this book--didn't even care who dunit. 2 stars for making it to page 88 and not putting it down sooner."
3,It's Ok,"Pros: Action, fast-paced, keeps you readingCons: superficial, testosterone enhanced, ""guy"" novel"
4,An International 'Die Hard',"I thought this story had great fun, witty comedy, and a clever, action-packed plot. Along with the other reviewer, the author makes silly foreshadowing in the ending chapters, that were completely unnecessary and dwarfted the integrity of his style; it was annoying. As I read this on vacation, it reminded me of a international-style, 'Die Hard.' If your looking for a christianity-conspiratorial-Jesus-scandal, high-speed and intense action, with some clever twists, and also excellent dialogue--specifically between Paynes and Jones...you will not be disappointed! It is a shame he has not received enough props for this as Dan Brown. This book was an enjoyable ride, sad to see it end!"
4,A Good Book,"Excellent plot, but slow connection of the three main elements of the book. Everything came together by the end of the book. Looking forward to reading The Plantation and the development of Payne and Jones."
4,Kuzneski outdoes Dan Brown with this highly imaginative thriller.,"Chris Kuzneski enters firmly into Dan Brown territory with this Jonathan Payne thriller whereby ancient evidence is unearthed that may shake the very foundations of Christianity. There may be proof that the crucifixion of Christ was nothing but a hoax perpetrated by the Roman Empire to instill their dominance over the globe. As threat of this discovery is revealed, a clandestine group begins performing crucifixions of well known people around varous points on the globe. With the secret behind these deaths being hunted by both Payne and friends along with a concurrent investigation by Interpol, will they be able to beat the race against the clock before more lives are lost or before this potential earth-shattering secret is revealed? You won't be able to turn the pages fast enough in this intelligent and highly imaginvative thriller."
4,Fun Read,"I'm a big Dan Brown fan. This book follows the same tones as a Dan Brown. I've read the other reviews and I think some of these folks are being too hard on this book. I found it to be very entertaining and a fast, exciting read. Some other reviews bash his story line -- come on people -- it's FICTION. Surely you don't believe everything you read in a fiction book. I did find it very thought provoking however I do not believe it to be true. Again, it's a fiction work.Some folks have bashed the characters in this book, but again, I don't want every major character in every book I read to be the same and have all the same characteristics. I enjoyed the plot line and the characters.No, this book will not become a literary classic, but I found it to be very entertaining. True, he's not a Dan Brown (yet), but I thought this was a very good book and enjoyed it. Well worth the price of a paperback.Overall -- Mr. Kuzneski -- good job!"
3,Decent,"I thought this book was fair. I enjoyed the plot, definitely thought it had potential, but I kept getting distracted by the author's writing style. Most of my beefs echo those already mentioned. There were jumps in point of view that were off-putting (that I believe it was the editor's job to fix) and the heavy forshadowing at the end of some chapters seemed out of place to me. The dialogue was occassionaly clunky and the coincidences/good fortune that helped the characters pursue their individual goals seemed a tad too constructed. The whole thing gave me the impression of an over-acted play. That being said, I was able to enjoy this as a light, escapist read but I won't go so far as to recommend it."
5,Fourth opus: the supreme expression of good taste!,"Eric Rohmer' s artistic personality has been one of the most original and eloquent. Expressive sobriety supported by a high caliber humor sense. In this lovable and intelligent work, the seduction issue has never been treated, as an admirable exercise of seduction that links with the purest tradition of the French theater of old ages, plenty of irony, sarcasm and fine charm.Indeed, the picture is extremely talky, and slow paved in consequence; Rohmer supports on an elegant and smart script plenty of fine intelligence; it's the art of the seduction in its highest order."
4,An unforgettable ending,"I must have watched this film at least twenty times--it never gets boring. A lot of talking in this film--if you don't know French, have fun reading the relentless subtitles. Interesting dialog about Pascal--the idea of fate, luck, wager. It serves as the film's allegory--gambling on a relationship with a person who is both sensual and pious. Can there be happiness in such a combination? One has to only take a chance. And even though you may think you found that special someone with both attributes, there's always a catch. And the catch in ""...Maud's"" is revealed at the end of the film--which is absolutely beautiful. The DVD is not as bad as some of the reviews here claim it to be--it's black and white, so with the exception of a couple of scenes with weak contrasts, I think it's an above average transfer. Heck, it's shot by Cuba's very own Oscar winner Nestor Almendros (Days of Heaven)."
4,Elegant watch,"This is a very elegant watch. It is on the heavier side, but it doesn't keep rotating on your wrist. It looks great on my wirst becuase I don't have a very small wrist, I think it might be too big if your wrist is tiny. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have any way that you could see the time in the dark. Otherwise, I would recommend this watch for the price."
1,Good movie - disappointment about region code,"I made the effort of actually order the dvd-movie from amazon to do everything correctly according to the law. I was very disappointed when the dvd was delivered and it had another region code than in the region I live in (and ordered from). I took for granted amazon took care of this problem. The movie is good (if I could see it) but the handeling from amazon in this case is poor, in relation to my expectations. They expected me to know that there are region codes and that they are different in US and Europe. I would have wanted to know this, since the product is absolutely useless for me."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","Proof of Life was a bit of a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan among others.In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the action/special effects are just average, while the plot is rather poor.Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.No masterpiece here... 3 Stars"
2,This is a terrible movie,"Although I admit to being sick of Meg Ryan and her ""acting,"" I thought I might be swayed by Russell Crowe's performance. Nope. I didn't think either actor acted very well and the story line was terrible. I felt very unsatisfied leaving the movie theater."
4,good performances,i thought this was an enjoyable film. though there was not too much action at no point did i feel board or wanting it to hurry up and end. Crowe gave a good performance as did the other actors. three days after seeing this film i bought it.
3,The movie is okay...,"the movie was okay, but a part of me knows that this could have been a great movie, if it had a better script or a better director. But the cast was great. There didn't seem to be much on this DVD as far as the special features goes."
2,This film is more effective than a sleeping pill,"Set in a small Latin American country where guerilla activity and drug smuggling is rampant, David Morse, husband of Meg Ryan, employee of Houston-based oil company, is kidnapped and held for ransom. Rescuers are Russell Crowe and his posse which includes David Caruso. Morse is decent guy but his character is overlooked in the rush to emphasize the machismo of Crowe,Caruso, et al, and their daring rescue deeds. Ryan is all nervous gestures, fiddling with cigarettes instead of acting (I think she's turning into a latter-day Diane Keaton),she has brief but hysterical outbursts every so often, and for two people who so famously had an affair, there are no virtually no sparks between Ryan and Crowe. Save your money."
4,"Great story, Good acting, Beautiful location.","I bought this movie because I heard that it was shot in Ecuador and I wanted to see what it looked like - that, and the fact that Russel Crowe is one of my favorite actors. I got even more than I bargained for because the story is well told and engrossing and the action is riveting. Meg Ryan does a fine job as the wife trying desperately to rescue her kidnapped husband, as does the actor who plays her husband. Really, the whole cast works well together to tell a thrilling story. This is one of the few movies that I could watch over and over.Don't skip the credits at the end, as the aerial camera circles the winged Virgin of Quito,pans across Quito cityscapes and rugged Andean scenes, and finally flies right inside the smoking crater of Pichincha!"
4,"Crowe is the main attraction; the story, so-so","The main attraction here is Crowe, and the story is okay. It would have been a bit better if the husband/hostage had not done such dumb things like antagonize his captors, and I think Meg Ryan was not the best choice for this particular role."
4,Second time viewing,Excellent story with a good Australian actorBased on actual events that can occur in countries less fortunate than our own
1,Sucked because Meg Ryan was in it - no more explanation needed,"But if you must know. It's the usual pathetic acting job by Meg Ryan that really brings down this movie. Little wonder most of her movies in the past 8 years have sucked. I can't believe she's cast in serious roles. Never works. Don't waste your time with this one, unless you're a Russell Crowe fan - then it's all right."
3,Russell Crowe does Steve McQueen,"In some countries, kidnapping has become a lucrative commercial enterprise. And when an American engineer (David Morse, 'The Green Mile') is taken by South American guerrillas, his wife (Meg Ryan) turns to the pros. Russell Crowe plays Terry Thorne, the kind of no-nonsense professional that Steve McQueen made a career out of. He's a hostage negotiator with K & R Consulting (Kidnap and Return) who quickly develops a soft spot for Meg Ryan (wouldn't you?) and stays on her case even after the insurance company footing the bill pulls out. The action is pretty good and all the leads handle it competently, but Ryan seems miscast. There's a good bit of double crossing to keep you guessing and the climax delivers a nice tight action sequence, but it's not the kind of film you'll remember long after it's gone."
2,Nice but,"I saw this movie about four times on a transatlantic flight yesterday (well I really watched it only once...) and I found it somewhat entertaining but not really exciting. Maybe that's a good thing. The drama side was refreshingly life-like (too bad it doesn't cater for today's scandal-hungry soap opera audience).On the other hand, the action side was a disappointment. Sure there was thrilling suspense and bullets and fire and blood, but the outcome was not very realistic. It was almost as bad as ""The Saint."" It was nice entertainment though -- I wish they could rig every war and other sports event the same way."
1,Proof of Life,"The product we recieved was only viewable in ""region 2"" which apparantly is not the United States. Therefore we were totally ripped off in our purchace of this item. Nothing stated a region viewable scenario, information as to how I could recieve a viewable edition of this video in exchange for the product we recieved would be helpful."
3,"Great story line, not so great acting","It pains me to write this,since I am a huge fan of Russell Crowe. His acting was great, as usual, but what is with Meg Ryan? She is so stiff and unrealistic! It looks like she was on a ""Saturday Night Live"" episode! The story line was good, but I just didn't get the attraction between the characters. One minute they're just kind of standing next to each other, the next minute they're kissing! It's almost as if there was no lead up to the feelings they felt for each other. I will watch it again because I could watch a movie with Russell Crowe just standing on a front porch or something, but I think Meg Ryan is better cast in her romantic comedy roles."
2,So So Movie,This movie had decent ratings on imdb. I wanted to see an action flick with a mix of thriller. This movie was ok and that exciting. All this have going for it is Russell Crowe.
3,Has Russell Crowe EVER let us down?,"There are certainly enough reviews here that give the gist of the plot, so I'll just give my opinion. I enjoyed this film because of the male stars and in spite of the female ones. Crowe, Morse, and Caruso are completely believable and intriguing. Ryan and Reed (who played her sister-in-law) are so bad they kept reminding me I was watching acting. The men could have acted opposite styrofoam dummies and done as well. It's amazing to see Crowe's Terry Thorne yearn for Ryan's Alice Bowman, whose own facial expressions reflect an awkward, gassy discomfort. Loved the film's climactic scene--excellently written, choreographed, filmed, and acted. Worth watching. The three stars are for the men. The two missing stars are for the women."
3,Proof of Life?,"This movie has good and bad points. Interesting plot, fairly executed, seemed ""real"", as in this could possibly happen although I think that the outcome was a bit far fetched-husband gets kidnapped by terrorist group, Meg Ryan tries to get help from his company, fails, hires a specialist (Russell Crowe), she falls in love with him, he gets husband back...I think that it is fairly impossible to get an abductee back, alive, after paying ransome. Meg Ryan gave a negatively outstanding performance. Didn't seem to be caring so much about her husband, etc. Russell Crowe was quite good-although I am biased-I think he is good in everything. All in all I think that it is a 3 star."
3,Deleted scenes,What I really want to see are the deleted love scenes that Taylor Hackford originally had in the movie. That would explain the unsatisfying ending between Alice and Terry. Their relationship would have made more sense.
4,Proof of love please,"I won't sum up the plot for you as others have but just have a few comments. I enjoyed the action, the tension of the hostage situation and all the acting was great. But I wish in the beginning they had made Alice's husband a little nicer fellow. He was pretty much a jerk to her and then when he's gone we're supposed to feel like she's tragically missing him? I think Russell Crowe's character was a better man to her. Not to say a wife in that situation should dump her kidnapped husband, but I would have cheered their reunion at the end more if their relationship in the beginning had been more heartfelt.The location of the movie, Ecuador, is amazing!! The photography was awesome and don't miss the closing credits with aerial views of the country and beautiful Van Morrison song. Breathtaking! Overall, really worth seeing this movie."
2,expecting better,"Whei I heard about proof of life, I set my expectations high because of russell crowe who was really good in the gladiator. However when I saw proof of life I was disappointed by the rather weak acting. Rusell Crowe has shown that he can act well like beautiful mind and gladiator but that is not the case in proof of life. The movie never quite takes off the ground"
5,Loved It!!!,"With all the obvious sexual tension betweenRussell Crow and Meg Ryan [which made the filmfor me], the breath-taking scenery and thewonderful action sequences, this movie gets my vote!There's something for everyone in it and is somethingthat anyone can enjoy. It's only a shame that therelationship between Meg and Russel was leaked outpublically which may or may not have affected theoutcome of the film...nonetheless- I loved the film so much. The actorswere great, the colors were outstanding and eventhough I hated the ending it gets my vote forbest movie!!! Kudos to Meg and Russel becausewithout their characters' tensions it would havebeen ruined!! .... it might not have won outat the box-office but it definitely won with me."
3,Slow but good,"Russell Crowe is an excellent actor, and this movie matched his performance in Gladiator. He is great as the silent, skilled, samurai type. Meg Ryan's character fell flat. The story is plausible and the supporting characters are realistic, although somewhat two dimensional. The action sequences are great. Definitely would have been worth an admission ticket and a great rental movie. Would consider buying if the price was right."
3,GOod...,"I didn't give a dime for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised after watching it. It's no masterpiece at all, far, far away from it, but Crowell, Morse, Caruso and ryan givestraighforward performances, no bullshi... included. Entertaining, if not phenomenal by any standards."
5,Very Smooth Film!,"Very good story and very good actors.I didn't use to like Russell Crowe much BUT I changed my mind after this film. He is the perfect man for this part, no doubt!The story is really good and from the very beginning we get the idea of who is who and what they do, their background and everything.I particularly liked the fact that it is realistic, without any twists-and-turns.Realistic dialogs like the fight between Alice and Peter. Realistic scenes, not like some other films where we see the hero jumping from helicopters and landing in his sofa at home and all these b...t stuff!Very good Action Film!"
2,medicore... no surprise,"Extremely bland, derivative, slow moving movie. The story is almost as thin as leading lady Meg Ryan. This movie is a waste of your time. It's not terrible but there are dozens of similar movies that are much better. I must admit the actions scenes were really well done. In a lot of action movies the action scenes feature blunders like the `good guys' surrounding the `bad guys' and shooting them forgetting the fact that they would shoot each other."
1,PROOF OF BOREDOM!,"There should be a Surgeon General's warning on this ironically titled disc that users will lose two hours of precious life and could even be bored to death as a side effect. Taylor Hackford directs Meg Ryan and Russel Crowe in a trite hostage rescue story that flirts heavily with the ""Casablanca"" plot and fails miserably. The only reason I watched the DVD was in the hopes that the infamous love scene between Crowe and Ryan would be included in the deleted material. But it is not. Hackford's insipid commentary track is a moronic description of the action on screen. (Or maybe it's meant for the hard-of-seeing?) He modestly admits he omitted the ""best love scene ... ever shot"" at the request of Ryan. What was he thinking? What about us, the voyeurs?"
3,Worth a watch,"Beautiful scenery in the movie. The idea of the movie is pretty normal, nothing too shocking or amazing. There is something about the Van Morrison song at the end that really stuck with me though. If you're out of ideas on what to watch for a movie, and like movies about people who are up for ransom / trying to find a loved one, check this one out."
3,Very Entertaining,"Meg Ryan's husband is working as an engineer in a ficticious Latin American Country. He is working on building a power plant out in the jungle, right in the middle of an area where cocaine is grown. He is kidnapped by gueirellas. Years ago the guerellas had a political agenda. They sold cocaine to finance their army. Now theire only agenda is to make money from selling cocaine. Russell Crowe plays a risk management consultant specializing in very high risk hostage negotioations. His job is to rescue Meg Ryan's husband. In the end, I wished for more resolution between Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan."
1,Proof of bad acting,"Meg Ryan's ""I need some time to grieve"" line was the best example of bad acting I've ever seen."
3,"Very typical ""Hollywood""movie","Disappointing from start to finish. The acting was wooden (especailly Meg Ryan's character, and the sister-in law character, not believable!) and the plot had all the lame required elements. I didn't pick up at all on any chemistry that was supposedly brewing between the Crowe and Ryan characters until he kissed her. I guess they cut a bunch of scenes since they were an item in real life. It took something important away there. I give it three stars because of the great location filming and the action scenes at the guerilla camp."
2,kill 'em all,sure .. lets kill dozens of poor peasants to rescue a rich American. What an offensive movie - and what's with all the smoking in this movie? is it sponsored by Marlboro or is it to show off the buffed arms of Meg Ryan - woo woo Meg - dont visually assault us with your physique next time - we'll take your word for it that your working out since you and your husband broke up.
3,Forget GLADIATOR,"Rule number one to accept this movie is to forget that you ever saw Russell Crowe in the Master Piece ""GLADIATOR""! Russell Crowe managed well to attract big number of us to attend this movie... but the movie itself failed to satisfy us!It is a weak ransom movie that I find insulting to audience's intelligence due to the fast meaningless love bond that got developed between Meg Ryan & Russell Crowe. This relation developed out of no where..!Meg Ryan reminded me of her great movie ""City Of Angels"", you can see her cry on the floor as if it was the same scene taken from her older movie... still she made a good job but she never had enough influence due to the character weak role and lines!There are so many weak points in this movie... but you may still be able to enjoy the movie as long as you do not remember Russell Crowe in Gladiator!I recommend seeing it before buying it!"
3,Two Words,"There's one main reason to pick up this PSX gem. Spy Hunter. As a child of the 80's, I'm really getting a kick out of playing this one all over again. The switchblades have a way of ruining your day, but I'm anxious to get back to the boating adventures of everyone's favorite spy. Moon Patrol, Joust 2, and Tapper are also fun for nostalgia's sake. However, Its Spy Hunter that will keep me coming back to this new addition to my PSX library."
4,Believeable tale of detective undercover in a newspaper,"John Dennison, private eye, goes undercover in the city-room of the Seattle Star to find a ""Harry"", a reporter who is black-mailing businesses to keep their bad news out of the paper. Interesting insider view of the newspaper world. Believeable, brisk, light-weight."
4,This is follow up to my review this morning,The hero's name is spelled Denson. Please correct my earlier review. the author deserves to have hte hero's name spelled right.
3,so so reading.......dull,"Gates and Juliana are both dimwitted. The book lacked something. With sharper characters, this one could have been better."
2,Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament into a brick wall.,As a diehard tennis fan and player I've been waiting for a good tennis video game to emerge. Unfortunately this is not it. Graphics and audio are good. Player characteristics are neat. Venues are very good. But just try beating Andre Agassi in the Semi Finals or even Martina Hingis for that matter. The action bears little resemblence to real tennis. The computer player pops winners down the line or cross court before you can blink. It's virtually impossible to maintain a rally of any kind. And believe me I've tried. Not only is the computer player on speed but the human player's character is conversely on sleeping pills. They should rename this game Frustration Court Tennis Pro Tournament.
3,Buy Sega Sports Tennis instead !,"Spent my money on this game and...well...it's not fun.It's more difficult than Sega Sports Tennis to master and if you're not at the right place at the right time, you miss the ball.Gets frustrating. The graphics leave a LOT to be desired and there are not many options for screen (video/audio/display) controls.You CANNOT create your own players. Characters are VERY slow to react/move.Sorry Namco...you blew it! I would like my money back please.SEGA did a wonderful job on SEGA SPORTS TENNIS...I'd recommend that one instead."
2,Fair game with some flaws,"Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament is a fair game.On the plus side, the tournament venues look good and the game controls are fairly simple to use. You can also choose from some of the top names on the tour (though there only 8 to choose from) and two player mode is fairly enjoyable.The minuses of this game are the character graphics which are a little blocky and there are only 4 tournaments to choose from; but the biggest minus is the computer controlled opponents in tournament mode. When you get to the semis or finals, the opponent is virtually unbeatable. I've played as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi numerous times and have never hit an ace along with hitting serves wide and up the middle at 120+ MPH and having them consistently hit back for clean winners. Along with not being realistic, it is very frustrating.I'd suggest waiting for Sega Sports Tennis (aka Tennis 2K2)."
1,Don't waste your money,This game is really bad. Bad graphics. Bad Game Play. Few Choices. Not realistic. ...
1,smash court tennis,smash court tennis has got to be the worst game i have ever played in my life.you can only choose from a small amount of tennis players and the graphics are also very bad.i would advise everyone to not buy this game because it would be a waste of your money.
4,"truth, justice... and the American way:?","Wow, Mark Millar ( a 'name' in the comic book world) created a story about Superman. What if he arrived a few hours later? What if he landed in the Soviet Union, and what is it about his arrival there that makes the heroes we know born in Russia. Even though there are some wierd inconsitencies, it is still a great alternate story. It stands alone. ANd it is good."
5,An Outstanding Graphic Novel,"The notion of the infant Kal-El landing in the Soviet Union instead of the United States is enough to stir the imagination, and this book doesn't disappoint. While true to the character of most of the personalities from the DC Comics universe, it manages to be neither formulaic nor predictable. It's the sort of book that improves with re-reading, which is a rare pleasure in comics these days.WikiPedia has a pretty good entry if you're looking for a detailed synopsis (there are plenty of spoilers - be warned), but if the premise of the story interests you at all, you won't be disappointed."
5,A great reimaging of an American icon!,"What a great Elseworlds tale. Superman is an American ideal but what if he crash landed in Russia in the late '30s? Well, read this and find out. This book is so well thought out and gorgeously drawn by both artists. I love all the easter eggs but they were needed for this to be unforgettable. I love how even though he was a communist he was still the hero we know. Fantastic work by Mark Millar!"
4,I hate superman comics...,"I am not a fan of superman. I think he is ridiculously overpowered and since his creation he gets a new ridiculous power every 3-5 years.BUT, I enjoyed this immensely. Some other reviewers have complained about various other characters being in different positions that they don't believe they would have occupied just because they didn't meet superman. I think most of it is plausable and when it isn't, it's more interesting to put known characters in a different situation than to just make up new ones to fill places in the plot. I don't see what others are complaining about."
5,My Favorite Superman Story,I've never really like Superman as a character. Superman never really had appeal to me. Mark Millar however wrote this interesting twist on Superman and his world. I loved it.
4,"Well written, well drawn",When I first looked at this coy of Red Son I was afraid I stumbled upon a poor reversal of Superman's roles. But I thought Amazon reader's reviews couldn't have been so wrong. I started reading it and by the end I was glad I bought it. Great scenario and an interesting combination of smart villains and political satire. The graphics nicely enhance the scenario. It's a good looking comic with a nice story and a very nice ending in my opinion. If you're reading this review I recommend you get the deluxe edition. I bought the soft cover just before I saw there was a hardcover available. It would have added a nicer feeling to it.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A very different relationship between Luthor/Superman and Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman, in this recreation of the Superman myth, witch Superman growing up a Ukrainian farm boy.Taking over for Stalin, the world becomes happy and communist, except for Luthor and the USA.A little twist at the end, too."
4,"pretty colours, interesting story, nice enough writing","Liked it, quite a bit. It's one I'm glad I own as I'll probably want to re-read it in the future."
5,Simply one of the best comics or stories ever written,"Mark Millar is a genius. His deconstruction of the DC universe is fascinating and brilliant. His depictions of Superman, Lex, Batman, and Wonder Woman show the depth's of Millar's understanding of the comic world."
2,wouldn't buy again,"Bought this guitar many, many years ago. Never could get used to the shape, which necessitates using the included strap. For some reason, maybe because I didn't use extra light strings as per Martin's recommendation, the guitar developed a couple of long cracks on the top, which surprisingly didn't seem to effect the sound that I could tell. I don't bother playing this guitar anymore and will probably be selling it soon. When I bought it, I thought ""wow, I'm getting a Martin, it's going to be great"", but I guess I was just naive. I have since learned that buying items for the name is not always the wisest policy."
2,Can't hear the low notes AT ALL,"The title pretty much says it all. It might as well be a ukulele.It's well made, and tough, but sounds like a toy, NOT a Martin.I sold mine after a week, and that's something I usually don't do."
3,Martin Backpacker Guitar,This is a very nicely made guitar with good attention to detail in both construction and finish. Very light weight and compact but the tradeoff is the lack of a full rich tone especially in lower registers. The strap seems to be essential for support since the narrow design limits use of your thigh as support (unless you hunch over). Comes with a soft case that is also good quality.
2,"Need to call it something other than a ""guitar""","This is an interesting instrument, but the sound is so anemic that I'd hesitate to call it a ""guitar"". It is to a guitar what a rubber practice pad is to a drum.It's not something you can play in front of other people. Maybe if you want to practice by yourself and you don't care about sound quality, it is acceptable. But I have to wonder about anyone who would rate this item 4-5 stars. That's being exceptionally generous."
3,The Great Mouse DEFECTIVE,"I had thought that Disney would never ruin their product when released on Blu-ray, since that format is all about QUALITY. I was wrong. Once again, the IDIOTS at Disney have ruined another glorious movie. This movie was filmed in a 1:66-1 aspect ratio. It won't take the viewer long to discover that foreheads and feet are cut in half or missing altogether in many scenes. I'M MAD, MAD, MAD!!!!!!!!!!!! WALT DISNEY EMPLOYEES, are you listening? STOP MESSING WITH THE ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIOS. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to FILL IT!"
4,Disney,As a fan of Disney animation This was one movie I'd not seen. It is a typical animation from this period of time. I really enjoy hand drawn animation. With Henry Mancini doing the score and Vincent Price as one of the voices I thought it might be a good watch. The story is not as engaging or as strong but the movie holds together well. What you would expect from Disney.
4,The game is a-paw!,"It's 1897 in foggy old London, and eminent - albeit diminutive - mouse detective Basil (he resides just below 221 Baker Street, the residence of a certain prestigious human detective) is hot on the case when a toy-maker named Hiram Flaversham (Alan Young) is kidnapped by Basil's archenemy, the vile Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price). Steeped in Victorian atmosphere, the mystery leads our hero from The Queen's palace to Big Ben and all points between. Voice cameos from Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and Laurie Main as Dr. Watson are a treat. Based on the Basil of Baker Street series of novels by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,great,"I enjoyed this very much as a child as it was dark and exciting. Now that I am older I still enjoy it, though not as much (i remember the plot way too well, saw it a billion times). I think kids around 10 will enjoy this a lot."
3,2.5 stars rounded up to 3,"We rank this 27 out of the 41 animated Disney movies that we own. We give it 3 stars because it was a nice average movie, that the kids just didn't pick to watch very often. The younger kids didn't care for Ratigan character. A mean witch is one thing, but the rat was to much for my youngest."
4,Good show for the kids,"Grand Daughter thought it was great. Good show to occupy the g-kids on rainy days. would buy it again, but all ready have it."
5,Just Like My Childhood,"I loved this movie as a kid. Being able to watch all these old classic Disney movies is wonderful!! It lets me have able to relive my childhood all over again and have able to share it with my future children. ""The Great Mouse Detective"" rocks!!"
4,The Great Mouse Detective,This is an interesting example of the latent potential prior to the Disney Renaissance.Fun and entertaining as only Disney can manage; complete with a mouse as the hero.
3,Not one of Disneys best but a good transfer,This is an enjoyable romp although it is not in the class of The Jungle Book or Robin Hood. The animation is a bit under par but by no means bad. The story is a bit weak and Basil not as well characterized as usual for Disney. I felt it was a bit scary for the very young and not clever enough to fully satisfy adults.
5,The Great Mouse detective,I love this movie and haven't seen it in forever. Very cute and original. Glad to own it.
4,Slightly Dated but Still Enjoyable,"I can see why some reviewers thought this film was slightly boring. Clearly the production techniques weren't up to par with the likes of ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladin"". It is interesting to note how Disney progressed from ""Mouse Detective"" to ""The Little Mermaid"" in four short years. Nevertheless, I find the movie charming, and thought the plot was well planned out, and the characters well developed. True, you don't have the stunning camera effects and music score that was to come with later Disney features, but this is animation at its finest at the fundamental level. Most traditional Disney animation is a work of art, and for those who study the craft, this movie is no exception."
5,I love this movie.,"Some movies you watch when you are young and think how great they are, then you watch them again when you are grown and think to yourself, that movie was not half as good as I remembered... This is NOT one of those! I love this movie to this day."
5,Classic Disney,"As always, Disney made another amazing and fun hit with Mouse Detective. Solid traditional animation, actual VOICE actors (not just a celebrity reading lines..), and solid storytelling that pulls from old legends we know and love. Love this movie!!!"
4,One of the better Disney films of the 1980s.,"Full of adventure and mystery, in this film, Disney takes a slightly more sophisticated turn and the outcome is really enjoyable. The film has really nice animation especially the scene atop Big Ben. The voice talent is great, especially the dastardly Vincent Price. The villain is good, and very malicious and powerful. The DVD is really good as well. The movie is in a new letterbox treatment- very nice. I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves the Disney film genre."
3,Regretfully too scary to recommend,"My 3-yr old loves watching this video at Grandma's house -- understandable given the appeal of some of the characters -- Basil, Olivia, etc. However, the bat and the rat -- the two main ""bad guys"" are way too scary-looking and sounding for my taste. Also, I think the theme of Olivia's father being taken away from her and then Olivia herself being kidnapped are too frightening for little ones. My son is the type who may not express his fears verbally but clearly gets fixated on the scary characters and is wrestling with their meaning inside. In turn, I simply don't recommend it for impressionable little ones."
3,"Lame title, oh yeah and missing a BLU RAY ALTERNATIVE!!!",Disney is the only company I know of that tries to push blu ray down everyone's throats yet except for a couple of Diamond Edition & new theatrical releases gives NO blu ray option. How many times do you plan to soak people with useless additional dvd releases without giving a high definition release???
2,faulty,"I ordered the movie, It got here quickly, however the movie would not play in my dvd player or computer. I emailed the seller and they were great, although they didnt have another copy, they refunded me and were very easy to deal with. so the rating is for the dvd not working, but the seller was very understanding."
2,It stinks,"All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes, but none of the charm. Dont get this movie for little ones!!!!"
1,"Not appropriate for children, weak plot, poorly executed.","I was seriously disappointed in this movie. We picked it to watch with a group of kids from 4-11 years old and none of them liked it. It has some unnecessarily scary parts with scary faces popping up out of nowwhere. Having your father violently kidnapped should be scary enough without the evil face popping in to get a scream. If it had a good plot or art, I might have given it 2 stars, but it is lacking in every measure. The strip tease act in the sleazy bar (I'm not joking. This scene is in the movie.) is completely in appropriate for children, the lyrics were dark and sleazy and no good for me, let alone my 5 year old daughter.Disney has a bunch of classics, this is NOT one of them.Mark"
2,an insult to release it at this point,"and they wonder why record companies lose money in downloads. HUGELY popular dance track that was basically out-of-print as an import single when it became big on US radio over a year ago. Various edits were tossed onto mix CDs to get people to spend money on compilations that crammed 20 dance tracks in highly chopped up mixes. Finally, the song was released with a number of mixes on a great maxi that had mixes of this, Safe From Harm, and When the Dawn breaks--with When The Dawn Breaks as the lead single. And now, they release this on its own, probably because no one realized it was on that other single. The only different offerings here are the full length Dean Coleman mix (edited on the other single) and the dubs. Track listing is:1. radio edit (3:09)2. dean coleman edit (4:10)3. original mix (7:25)4. pete lorimer's 29 palms mix (9:53)5. dean coleman's players only vocal (7:49)6. pete lorimer's 29 palms dub (9:10)7. dean coleman's dirty by design dub (8:38)"
4,The worst Way To Spend Your Summer Or Is It?,"The Worst Way To Spend Your Summer Or Is It? Four young black teens from New York are caught by the police spray painting a rail road car and are sentenced to work in an old folk's home for the summer. One of the young boys has been in trouble with the law several times before but finds he has more in common with the seniors from the home than the others. They are forced to be together, none or them liking the circumstances that brought them together; however, as they get to know each other they find their lives are changed. Earl, the boy who has been in trouble before is living with Steve and Steve's parents on a trial basis but wants to have a permanent home. The book is written as if Steve Perry is writing to his journal. If you like good humor mixed with serious problems dealing with old age then you would like this book as I did."
5,Won't Know Til I Get There,"This story is about a group of four kids that get into trouble with the law.As punishment the kids have to help the senior citizens that live at Micheaux House Senior citizens home.The senior citizens that live there are both black and white.Afterreading this book you will find out that the senior citizens home might get closed down. In order to try to save the home the senior citizens decide to open a deli and the kids help.I thought this book was funny because of the waythe people talk and the the words that they use. The pedicaments that the kids and the senior citizens get intoare pretty funny also.Plus the problem in this story probably happens every day,and this book tells you about a group of people that are different nationalities and age s worked together to try to save a senior citizens home. So all in all I thought this book was funny and realistic."
4,"Great print, missing extras","Apocalypse Now is definitely one of those films that people either ""get"" or don't. I am with the crowd that considers it one of the great film achievements of the 20th century. I agree with the many folks who have commented critically that this DVD should have included extras (beyond the extra footage), but I am very pleased with the quality of the print and the transfer to DVD. The color saturation is fantastic. I'll have to look into the criticisms that aspect ratio is incorrect."
2,The Incomplete Dossier,"This is my favourite movie of all time and I was really looking forward to the release of this box set. I was truly dissappointed that the two versions of the movie were split in half over two discs. This really spoils the enjoyment of watching the movies and I have never come across this on any other DVD. Also, the lack of the ""Hearts of Darkness"" documentary or ANY decent documentary about the film (s) in the package is a huge wasted opportunity. The deleted scenes should definitely have been cleaned up for the fans too. Most of the other extra features were largely uninteresting and criminally short or dated. I asume ""The Ultimate Dossier"" will be out at some future point but I'm baffled why this wasn't so much better."
2,A Masterpiece Defaced,"I HATE war movies.Apocalypse Now, as it was originally released, was not a war movie; it was a work of art, a nightmare captured on film. The first time I saw it, I walked out of the theater stunned and speechless, and I am still left in that same state every time I watch the DVD.Unfortunately, Apocalypse Now Redux has been Redu-ced to nothing more than a war movie, the nightmare subsiding and reality taking over. Once a masterpiece of film, every frame worthy of a spot in the Louvre, is now just another... war movie. What a shame."
3,Deleted Scenes should stay deleted!,The movie is great except that this version includes the scenes that didnt make it to the screen movie and there was a reason for that! So while watching the movie you are forced to fast forward through these annoying long pointless scenes that ruin the pace of the movie.Otherwise its still a great movie classic.
2,Learn how to retain last image while changing dics.,"Short and simple. You have to change dics in the middle of the movies. Each starts out on dics one and finish on dics two. There is new stuff, but they did leave out the destruction of Kirk's camp. Poor show."
3,"Oh, the horror...","This was one of the greatest war movies ever. The ""Redux"" version is way too long. It loses focus with the added scenes. I highly recommend the original compared to this."
2,Trolling For Dollars - Redux,"There is only one reason to have released this version of the modern classic Apocalypse Now -- $$$$. The scenes brought back from the cutting room floor should have stayed there. The stolen surfboard scene breaks the somber, single minded intensity that is the Willard character. The French plantation scene drags and drags (though the funeral portion IS good). The additional bunny encounter is pure drivel.If you have a copy of original, don't waste your money on this one. If you don't, don't waste your money on this one - find the original.It's too bad that all re-released ""Director's Cut"" editions aren't required to contain a copy of the original as a part of the package."
3,Added scenes don't add much,"The added scenes serve only to lengthen an already long movie. A bit more surfing absurdity and a lengthy scene that's as much about rape as comedy (more rape, probably--and a strange--and unfunny--comedy scene)Too many directors are second guessing themselves! Why must they alter their own visions?"
3,A director's cut taht shouldn't have been made...,"Apocolypse now is an excellent movie. Very few people would argue this, but the Redux, which adds 40 minutes to a movie already 2 hours long, is over doing it. some of the scenes added do indeed enhance the movie, but most are generally unnessecary and don't add much to the film, or draw out the story with meanlingless blather that doesn't even serve to enhance character development. If you have a DVD remote and can skip the scenes that were added that detract from the overall film, great, other wise get the VHS and pray they release the original cut."
4,This is not a War Film,"This is not a war film, though often mistaken for one, leading to the false opinion of attempting and failing. Rather this is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" set in the convienent realm of Veitnam that is more accessible to the general public than some deep, dark, primal Africa.In this effort the film succeeds remakably bringing to the fore all of the conflicts both of ""Marlow"" as he travels into the ""heart of darkness"" and struggles to resist the desires to be an effective God, or to follow his original intention, to kill Kurtz, and the depths to which Kurtz has lost himself to his dark desires. ""The horror."""
4,Fast Delivery,"Movie came on time. I purchased it for someone else, but I haven't heard any complaints about the DVD being scratched once it was opened."
5,Made a wonderful gift...,Not my favorite movie but my sweetie just adores the extended version. He was delighted with the DVD and has already watched it multiple times.
4,Apocaupse Now Redux,Very pleased with saw the origianl but had to get this on DVD. Glad they redid the film Thank you
3,Apocalypse Now Redundant,"I wish I had never seen this version of ""Apocalypse Now"". Though the original theatrical version was not without it's flaws, the insertions here just drag down the proceedings. What point was there in putting in the Playboy bunny scenes other than for titillation? The French rubber plantation scenes may be Coppola's attempt to comment on colonialization but they just upset the rhythm of the film. The only addition that makes sense here is the additional scene with Marlon Brando reading from ""Time"" magazine. This scene illustrates how his character,Colonel Kurtz, is straddling the slippery fence of madness and sanity and makes his character more sympathetic. Let me state up front that I feel that the original version of ""Apocalypse Now"", despite it's flaws, is a masterpiece and I would unequivocally give it 5 plus stars. Despite the redundancies of ""Redux"" this is still a great film."
4,Bigger is not always better,"I have been a movie enthusiast all my life, but when i saw this movie (on its original release) I was blown away.I could not believe that sound, image and story could be mixed in such a magnificent way... The movie was a trip for me.Years latter comes the Redux... Apocalypse is still as powerful as ever but some of the added scenes break the frenetic rythm of the original.Some of the scenes help us to see Captian Willard as the auto-destructive S.O.B. is only hinted in the original, but others not only break with his image, but also put the character out of context.I would have loved to give this one a 5 stars review."
4,See the Original First,"Before i knew that the redux was to be released I saw the original Apocalypse Now and regretted not seeing the redux first instead. But after seeing the redux I was glad that I had seen the original first. The original is long enough as it is. The slower pace of the redux version, coupled with the longer play time, may turn hurt first time viewers opinion of the movie as it did for my friend.The redux is at least a must see for Apocalypse Now fans; I own it, but it is not for the first time viewer."
4,Contiguity?,"Simple and straight, all this lacks is contiguity. i.e. they should have put redux on one disk and theatrical on another. Rather thatn splitting them both betweeen the two. Simply uncalled for. I know why they did it and I suppose you can consider the same marketing delimma as well. But it was not necessary. Great movie. Terrible packaging/production quality. Deserve's five stars. Would like to give other copy to friend. But why not you say? Maybe for no good reason at all."
3,The movie is spread over two discs,"Just as I said in the title, both versions of the movie are spread over two discs, which is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.It perplexes me to think that two versions of a film in a two disc set splits both movies up over two discs instead of putting one version on disc 1 and the other on disc 2. I want to know what the logic was to do this? I could speculate, but I'd love to know what drugs were actually being smoked when this decision was reached. Do the studios actually think the consumer enjoys having to change discs to see ONE movie?This is worse than selling wide and full screen versions of a movie separately."
1,What were they thinking?,"Yeah - it's a bummer that they didn't include Hearts of Darkness, but putting Redux and the original together was irresistable (although I much prefer the original).I was ENRAGED that some idiot decided to put half of each movie on 1 disc, instead of the original on one and Redux on the other.All I can say is - WTF!!!If you prefer to sit back to enjoy films in their entirety, do yourself a favor and don't buy The Complete Dossier.It's such a shame too, the packaging was insanely cool."
3,Get the 3-disc version,"There is also a 3-disc version of Apocalypse Now available as a limited-time Circuit City promotion. The third disc contains a trailer for each version of the movie, a short documentary (7 minutes), and the missing ""Destruction of the Kurtz Compound"" scene both with and without commentary from F. Coppola. The third disc comes in a sleeve inserted into the packaging. There is a sticker on the packaging indicating the presence of the third disc (""while supplies last"").I don't know if this material was intentionally withheld from the DVD solely for the purposes of this promotion, but if so, that is very disappointing and frustrating!"
4,Better than the original,"This version of Apocalypse Now--Redux--is the one to see, at least as an instant video on Amazon. The picture is brighter, the sound clearer and the pauses fewer than with the original. The original film as seen on instant video is visually dark and murky and both the original and Redux have some instances where the movie stops briefly, but these pauses occur more often with the original. A couple of scenes have been added to Redux and their value can be debated, but this is surely one of the two or three classic Viet Nam films."
5,apocalypse now on video,"I was surprised to see that it was a 2 cd set. That was great, also the fact that Francis coppola gave a scene by scene analysis. Had absolutely no problems with the transaction, price was good, and shipped promptly. Thanks"
4,apocalypse now,great movie unbeleivable cast sen it before on regular vhs now in dvd with great sound system the movie is twice better.
5,Apocalypse Now- Damn!,"There's a lot to be said about this movie, and I'm not the one to do it.I will only say that this is a fantastically well made movie, it is incrediblyentertaining and it's worth seeing just on those bases.But it's a complex story that merits a lot more analysis than I'm qualified tospeak to.Short story: I'm simple minded enough to love a truly great movie like thiseven on its simplest terms. But you will love it too."
5,The power of myth,"The first time I watched this film it ""really put the hook in me"" Apocalypse Now is the benchmark I use for watching film. The movie made me want to read heart of darkness, the golden bough, and from ritual to romance, trying to understand mankind's decisions with power. Never under estimate the power of myth"
4,Exceptional War Film,"An exceptional war film in every sense, it pulsates with artistic ambition. It reaches for truth, struggles for greatness--and almost succeeds. The central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), tells the story of his danger-filled journey toward a fateful meeting with a man named Kurtz, a highly decorated officer who the Army contends has gone mad."
2,Wanna be anti war movie,"[...].As a Vietnam veteran, one tour enlisted, one tour as an officer, this film depicts the struggles, complications, and conduct of the Vietnam War about as well as most 40's and 50's films depicted Custer's last stand. In other words, not even close. Directed by someone who had never been there, starred in by actors who had never been there, with results like they had never been there, BUT THEY ARE AGAINST WAR. DUH!!!We all know war is hell. Many have said that many times many long years ago. This slap in the face to all those who fought well and tried their best by a bunch of people unwilling to place their own hides in jeapordy for a philosophy so tenuous as FREEDOM, [is] really [bad], no matter how good the special effects or expensive the number of extras."
4,"Weird, but good","The film has a very dark atmosphere throughout it. The only flaw is that there were many un-necessary scenes and the movie could have been much better without them. There was only one major battle, and that was near the beginning of the movie. The action in the battle was fantastic. But where's the rest of the action? Some parts in the movie were really boring, I kept waiting for something to happen, and it eventually did. In my opinion, this is just an average, or slighty above average War movie.Score - B"
5,NOT FOR CHILDREN.,"GREAT MOVIE. BE FORWARNED IT IS BRUTAL AND VIOLENT. THERE ARE THREE PORNOGRAPHIC SCENES. SO, BE QUICK WITH THE REMOTE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO WATCH GRAPHIC PORNOGRAPHY. IF YOU FAST FORWARD PAST THE PORN IT IS AN AWESOME MOVIE. NON BETTER!"
2,Well made but too much,This film appeard to me that it was just written by a person that did not like Viet Nam and just wanted to make it look as bad as possible. As they travel down the river there is one chance after another to do that. Most of it I just found wierd. The acting and screenplay was absolutely superb but nonetheless I just did not connect with anyone in the film. Sorry to those die-hard that find this movie one of the greatest ever.
1,Sominex Now!,"What happens when you mix a good director with a good cast and a boring, half-baked plot? You get ""Apocalypse Now.""AN's plot is too bizarre to have even a modicum of credibility and having seen this film a few times, I still don't get the point of it. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's a perfect fit for Marlon Brando mainly because the characters are dull and one-dimensional--much like Brando himself! Moreover, AN also suffers from bad directing and editing which makes it a rather difficult movie to follow.For all its potential, AN never lives up to its hype and I fail to see why it received so much acclaim. For a war movie, AN doesn't have a lot of action so if you're a war movie buff, chances are it won't hold your interest. If anything, AN is about as interesting as watching dust settle on your VCR. Avoid it with extreme prejudice."
4,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","APOCOLYPSE NOW is a monumental war film, spectacularly filmed by Francis Ford Coppola, in any version.However, when this ""redone"" version was released in 2001, all it really did was provide me with the opportunity to see this film on screen for the first time, as I was too young to see it in 1979.With the exception of THE ABYSS and RETURN OF THE JEDI, alternate and special editions of movies have never sat right with me.; like colorizing black and white movies. As a film purist, I believe there's usually a reason film are made the way they are the first time around.The footage that's been restored here only serves to make the film much longer, and before you know it, you're watching the ""Heaven's Gate"" version of a film you already loved.It's APOCOLYPSE NOW! It's always great! Own it on DVD, but buy the original 1979 version!"
3,Not as good as the original theatrical release,"This film has been recut with an extra 45 minutes. None of the scens added are particularily good except the extra Marlon Brando scene and the french plantation scene. But the film could do with out those also. Many of the new scenes like the play boy bunnies and teh stealing of the surfboard are to the detriment of the story and the characters. Still even this cut is better than most films out there. Good to see out of interest sake, but will always watch the original release for satisfaction."
3,Reediting a great can be a mistake!?,Ladies and gentlemen sometimes a great movie needs nothing more than a re-release. I think Disney did it right in the past when they re-release movies after 20+ years like they sis with fantasia. This movie never needed to be reedited. I do not know what is wrong with just digitising movies to fix color and sound and then just doing a re-release. It seems to me that the directors have a death wish on there hands and want so destroy there greatest works! From ET to Star Wars when will it end? Listen I am all for directors cuts and extended versions but those are done as part of the movie release to DVD or Tape and not years after production. Let the greats remain great and ACOCALYPSE NOW is best apreciated in it's origional form! The Great movies of all time are great becuse of origionality and beauty they have origionaly.Thank you!
1,What the Heck,I purchased this to show my students in connection with our unit on Heart of Darkness. I chose this version because it was significantly cheaper than the original. Bad choice. The scenes that were added include gratuitous sex and violence. They add nothing to the story line. It is clear why they were not included in the original. Advice is to spend a few extra dollars and get the original.
2,Why spend $50 when you can get it for $20 with Hearts of Darkness?,"Owning this boxed set makes me feel like an idiot--the Blu Ray with Hearts of Darkness goes for $20. An A/V club featurette? Really? Save your money and buy the Blu Ray or any of the other single movie versions, there is nothing in here worth an extra cent."
1,posibly the worst movie ever,"maybe i'm just too stupid to understand it, but this movie is even more boring than About Schmidt is. i mean, it shows horrors of the war but not much more. not even worth reviewing. the only good thing is, i didn't buy the dvd i rented it."
5,Whish it was on one disk!,"Love the movie both of versions of them. I just really would of sacrificed the ""special features"" to have them put at least one of the versions on the same disk. You really start to get in to the movie and then the mood is destroyed by having to get up and change the disk knowing darn well they could have easily put it all on one disk. Had I known I would have bought a use old copy that was on one disk. But the movie is great!!"
3,WHAT REALLY HAPPENED,"The complete dossier is better than the 79 movie,complete dossier comes closer to what really happened over there than any book or movie ever has, well worth the time to sit down and watch"
1,Conspiracy theory,"I owned the previous versions and I am disappointed that the movies were split into 2 discs on this complete dossier set. The movies were not showed in the cinemas with intermissions when they were released.It does not make too much sense to arrange the movies this way. The only reason I saw it happening was to avoid 2 causal viewers sharing the cost of buying this already discount-priced set and each getting a version of the movie home. Of course, this is just my little conspiracy theory to vent my dissatisfaction with the new set.The sad part of this story is: I may buy the DVD(s) again if they do it right (possibly including the Heart of Darkness) the next time."
5,A blu ray transfer done right,"I had a lot of reservations about the transfer of this film. My fears revolved around Francis Ford Coppola and his tendency to try to impose his will on the technology involved in the tranfer. I have seen too many important films ruined by the unnecessary intervention of a director. Much to my delight there was so much micromanagement of this film...it looks great. My other fear was the overabundance of grain...but this wasn't an issue. This 1979 film looks great...and the inclusion of both versions of the film was a nice perk. I wouldn't waste money on the ""Full Disclosure"" version...Hearts of Darkness is a waste of time and money..its no more than a glorified extra feature."
1,did not work,The previews worked but the movie did not work in two differant DVD players and returned it in 2 days
2,Heart of Darkness meets the Playboy Mansion,"The original Apocalypse Now gave Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness a modern context. Redux added gratuitous female nudity, expanding the potential audience to include less literately endowed minds."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","This is my favorite movie of all time, so my rating certainly doesn't reflect on the quality of the movie at all, rather the DVD design. This is a two disc set and instead of putting the original on one DVD and the Redux on the other DVD they put the first half of both versions on disc 1 and the second half on disc 2. I think this ruins the flow of the movie because you have to get up and load the other dvd halfway through the movie. LAME!"
3,"Great price but not a ""Complete.Dossier""!","At $19.99 , this is a great bargain for a great film with a lot of nice extras but calling this edition which includes both the original theatrical cut and the inferior ""Redux"" is a complete misnomer. Most notable is that it does not include the great ""Hearts of Darkness"" documentary, argueably one of the greatest making of docs ever made! It also does not seem to port over extras from the previous edition such as the ""Destruction of the Kurtz Compound"" featuring commentary from Coppola. Mr. Coppola what are you thinking !??! I'm sure fans wouldn't mind dishing out a few more extra bucks for a true definitive ""Complete Dossier"". Looks like I can't get rid of my old edition yet. Please Mr. Coppola and Paramount, do it right !!!"
4,Great Flick,"Look this was a good movie, im gonna say if youve never seen it before you can even skip the renting stage and just buy it and you'll be very pleased with your purchase....im just posting because im so sick of seeing these people actually use the 1,000 word maximum......i probably speak for most people when i say that when i see these big long reviews i just skip right through em....i mean a simple plot summary and opinion is really all thats necessary...you supposed ""movie -gurus"" need to get a life and stop boring everyone with your insights because most of the time its a bunch of garbage anyway"
3,different...,I'm not really a war movie kind of guy and had to watch this for my English class on the Vietnam War and the literature and media related to it. The movie was confusing at times and probably needs to be watched twice to catch somethings you miss but seeing how it's a fairly long movie it's probably not something you want to sit through again. Overall it was just ok but I wouldn't bother seeing it again.
1,This movie is pathetic.,"Not a movie for a thinking person... a movie for people easily impressed by shadows and lies. I'm starting to think Martin Sheen ruins every movie he's ever been in. The whole movie makes you wait for some huge revelation. In the end there is none, just an empty pathetic husk of truth."
4,It was a gift,I purchased this item as a gift so I cannot accurately give a review for the movie itself but I will say that the shipping was lightning fast and the price was VERY reasonable. Thanks Amazon!
1,clueless...,"this film never made any sense to me--simply because this director never lived through any of it and does not get the subject. critics who praise this mess are just as misguided as the guy who made this joke of a war flick.the reason Platoon works for me is because Stone knew what he was talking about; he lived it, spent time in the jungle, was shot at, etc.what's the use?get it if you like being conned.the most hated line in the history of the cinema (for me) is ""I LOVE THE SMELL OF NAPALM IN THE MORNING.""I wished someone could have taped the actor's mouth shut for saying something so insidious."
1,Vietnam?,"Alot of people loved this movie but if you were there like I was(68-69) you'd be saying""What the Hell is this?"" They should have called it""The Manson Family of the Boonies"" Ridiculous!"
4,good helicopter Music in trailer,"If you have a sound system with four loudspeakers, you may want to skip the film and just listen to the helicopter music echoing around the room in the trailer. Seriously, it's a good film, but having watched the Deer Hunter the night before, I found it a bit tame. The plot is easy to follow: a soldier is requested to track down a top-notch colonel in Vietnam who has apparantly gone crazy. But him and his collegues' experiences in Vietnam are nothing compared to Russian Roulette (dam I keep refering to THAT film). When he eventually catches up with Brando, I was expecting loads of action, but the film just ended as if they ran out of budget. Did I miss something here ?"
1,Directors should not play Janitor,"Coppola should have stayed away from the cutting room floor. This ""redux"" is an extremely poor attempt. I can only guess that Coppola needs the money. If I could sue him for littering upon my DVD, I would."
3,Okay...,"My dad told me a scene where a soldier takes out a NVA soldier in the dark with a grenade launcher. So, thinking that was really cool, I wanted to buy it. When I did and watched it, I was bit disappointed. The plot is slow and really weird. Also, it's just Redux, it does not come with the original."
2,Poor DVD quality,I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor. towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying.
2,"Boring, dull, overrated.","This film is just boring beyond words. All it involves is a boat going up a river and stopping to blow stuff up. There is this guy called Killgore who Sheen (forget the characters name) meets along the way. Sheen needs the support of his air forces but Killgore balks because there is a VC village at the river's mouth. But then, wait for it, he changes his mind when one of the boat crewmen tells him of the great surfing available there. Thats right, soldiers in this film go surfing....And it looks fake as well, you never get the feeling there is a real war going on partly because the acting is rubbish by all involved except for Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen. And everyone looks like they are on drugs. The ending was one of the worst endings I have ever seen and I think it would have been ALOT better if General Kurtz wasn't insane and was a much better adversary.The only thing ""horrifying"" is how boring it is."
1,Too boring and inaccurate,"I very much like war movies, but I have no idea what this movie was about. It was way off in depicting the Vietnam War (if you want a good depiction of that war, check out Platoon) and besides that, I still didn't find the movie interesting or anything remotely representing an Academy Award winning movie."
1,FROM A SPECIAL FORCES VIETNAM VETERAN,"I am a Vietnam Special Forces Veteran, I served my Country from 1965- 1967 in Vietnam..... I have witnessed various horrors during those teribble times Therefore I consider myself a fair judge of Vietnam motion pictures... I can tell you that I watched various films about the Vietnam War, Platoon, Full metal Jacket, and what I believe came closest to the way it wasWas, We were Soldiers..........I have just seen Apocalypse......WHAT A BUNCH OF BULL......... Vietnam was nothing like this!!!!!!!!!Ask any Vietnam Veteran......This contribed story should be packaged with some of the Disney Classics......it just a silly fantasy or a bad LSD Trip.....it just does not tell the truth of what the Vietnam Experience was like, If you are truly Interested in seeing what it was like, please watch one of the other fore menchioned movies..their far more accurate ........"
1,"BORING, BAD ACTING, NOT REALISTIC, AWFUL","This movie is not worth seeing. Don't waste your time, and go for the newer productions. In the time the movie was made they certainly did not know what they were doing."
1,-5 not listed,"Sick! This is the kind of movie that is purely a dillusion on what happened in Vietnam. It's becuase of sick movies like this that gave America's vets a bad name. If you want to see a LSD version of the war that is sick, tasteless, and offensive, this movie is for you. But if you want a TRUTHFULL look on what happened in Vietnam, watch HAMBURGER HILL, 84 CHARLIE MOPIC, AND PLATOON."
5,An awesome film that shows the heart of darkness.,"This is a great film. It is a version of a classic novel ""The Heart Of Darkness"". I grew up watching this film with my father a Vietnam Vet, maybe not the best film for a youngster, but it didn't mess me up any. Seriously though to understand all the suttle points in this movie everyone needs to read the book."
5,Just another classic film for the purists!,"Having only recently seen the orignal cut of this movie, then picking up the Redux version of it, I can't help but rave about the techncal accomplishments, not the mention the superb editing job done on the DVD.None of the addes scenes detract much from the film, and they add a little bit more balance to certain segments--the French Plantation scene being perhaps the most jarring. I was mostly amazed while watching it that I didn't find the extra length had me looking at my watch.This would actually be a 6-star rating if only they would have included the superb documentary ""Hearts Of Darkness"", which is as good as the film itself, really. It's also missing a commentary track, which is a sin, but Coppola would have his work stand for itself, and thankfully, this is a film that does exactly that."
4,Apocalypse Now.... and Then,"It's good to see that after 20 years, this film can still engender so much passion and controversy.For my six cents' worth, I'll start by stating that neither the original or the Redux versions are perfect. Some inconsistencies of the original are ""fixed"" by Redux but I agree that some of the extra footage was superfluous, particularly the Playboy bunny scene at the Medevac hospital. However, the plantation scene serves to divorce the viewer from reality and adds to Conrad's vision of a world gone mad through imperialism in ""Heart of Darkness"". Don't forget Conrad based his novel on his experiences in the Belgian Congo over 100 years ago.PS I would have loved more extras with the Redux release and it would have been great if Paramount had included Mrs. Coppola's ground-breaking documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"" about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"" with location shots and the pure hell of putting a masterpiece together. Perhaps there were copyright issues."
2,"Rent this, buy the original","Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the most memorable and powerful films ever made. However, the ""Redux"" version is completely unnecessary, with the extra footage greatly harming the finished product. As expected, the sound and video quality of the DVD is superb, but as for the movie itself, the original version is far superior. If you are looking for a much better companion to Apocalypse Now, try ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse"", which is basically a ""making-of"" documentary of Apocalypse Now. Not only does it show you a great deal of the additional scenes in ""Redux"", but it's an absolutely fascinating exploration of the process of making the film."
5,"The Music ! , It drives the natives nuts!!","An all star cast, I went to see this movie back in 1979 in 70mm. This movie has many one liners and of course the most famous is the ode to napalm "" I love the smell of napalm in the morning ""But my favorite "" Do you want to fight or do want to surf?""And of course the music <Wagner> What a great use of!But the most interesting statement is ""Every time I am in the jungle all I can think about is home, And when I am at home all I can think about is being back in the jungel <WOW!>And ""charging a man for murder would be like handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500""This movie is very powerful way to describe war and the internal missions that are not talked about !This movie is based on the Joseph Conrad book ""Heart of Darkness""This movie is more mental<slow> than most war pictures that use action to keep the pace.But not needed here , Sure there is action but not like ""Midway""The Horror!Enjoy!"
4,I forgot how weird...and good,"I forgot how weird and good this movie was unitl I purchased the DVD. More than a ""war movie"", Its still a great movie experience most of the time with outstanding photography. However, it really stretches at times and gets a little to far out there at the end."
5,Great Movie,"There are plenty of good reviews if you need them. This is truly a wonderful movie. Rent/Buy it and see for youself (the original that is, not redux)."
4,The Most Terryifing Retelling Of Vietnam,"Apocalypse Now, which was based on the Joseph Conrad book Heart Of Darkness, is a dark and disturbing look at Vietnam. Martin Sheen gives a excellent performance as a Vietnam soldier sent to take out Colonel Kurtz. Marlon Brando plays Colonel Kurtz in his most powerful role since The Godfather. The cinematography was brilliant and brought Vietnam to life. But, this film has not that much to do with Vietnam like Platoon or Hamburger Hill. It has more to do with the horrors (The Horror... The Horror.) that changed Colonel Kurtz. The Doors made a excellent remix of The End for Apocalypse Now. I suggest everyone that likes Vietnam movies, Francis Ford Coppola, or someone that was accutally there see the redux or see the DVD."
3,One of Coppola's Finest Hours,"Francis Ford Coppola's engaging Vietnam war story is considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. While I'm not sure about that,I am sure of the fact that I do enjoy watching this movie. This isn't just for Coppola fans,or war movie fans,but is intended to entertain everybody! Wonderful performances through out the cast(Martin Sheen is excellent in his role. Also the supporting players like,Robert Duvall,and Marlon Brando)! The highlights here are the truly outstanding cimatography by Vittorio Storaro(A Bertolucci regular). Of course Coppola's directing. Brando's ""horror"" soliloquy is up there with some of the grestest moments ever filmed. I only wish there was more screen time for him,not that I'm disappointed with Sheen leading the cast. This is a must for movie lovers...make sure you buy this movie!"
4,I love the smell of a good war movie.,A.N. is an excellent war movie about everything thats good and bad about a war. It explored deep into the minds of the individuals involved.Does any1 know when A.N. will be released on DVD?
5,Much beter than the Redux version,"With a few minor exceptions this original version is a much tighter, focused & far superior edit to the rambling Redux version, often the artists are not always the best judge of their own work, like many great directors/artists even Coppola needs some contraits to weed-out the superflous scenes to make the movie flow better.Yes the Redux has it's values to afficianadios,and fans but this is a much better punchy version IMHO.BTW I have seen the 3.5 hr workprint version and it is a masterpiece but only for real movie buffs who enjoy unused scenes &the pure genious of the camera work, set design, music score & unused characters like Scot Glen (who shot himself ??)Even Brando's pudgy USA soundstage poetic ramblings are pure magic."
5,Tour de Force,"This movie is encapsulated in the narrated line, ""If that's how Kilgore fought the war, I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz."" Willard hates lies. Kurtz hates lies. However, this is the wrong war to be in if one hates the stench of lies. This theme runs through the movie, but whether this is what Coppola and Milius were trying to get across is left to conjecture.If you liked the narration, written by Michael Herr, read his book ""Dispatches."" It reads much the same as Willard sounds in the movie."
3,The redux adds almost nothing to the original,"Some of the new stuff was just plain silly, including another encounter with the Playboy bunnies. The only thing that the redux really adds is a scene in which Brando reads news clippings to Martin Sheen, and even then the value is limited. Still, it's a great movie worth seeing on the wide screen, but don't expect cinemagraphic satori."
5,One of the very best films of all time!!!,"Just to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of war movies. I checked out this classic film for the very first time and I was totally mesmerized with the dark character study of a war film. The acting was top-notch, the story very moving, and the settings of the film very wonderful. ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of those films where it will stay with you for a very long time after the ending of the film."
3,"Error in production of disc 2, additional scenes section","I love this movie and it looks great on Blu-ray. Seeing Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando in a movie made over 30 years ago looking like they filmed it last year (it was that well re-mastered) was a truly mind-boggling experience. BUT, there seems to be an error in disc 2 in the Additional Scenes section. All of the scenes are cut off in the screen, you can only see the bottom 4th of the screen and the rest is blacked out, clearly a mistake, but other features on the disc are fine. Did anyone else experience this???"
3,"Shows the madness of war, but is incredibly inaccurate","Apocalypse Now isn't particularly a combat war film like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. Instead, like Full Metal Jacket and The Deer Hunter, it slowly shows the effects war has on the soldiers even when they're not in combat. It works well in the film, but it's incredibly inaccurate about the war. For example, American soldiers never had a playmate party beside a river on a very large platform. They also aren't obsessed with surfing. The performances are all around good. I still thought The Deer Hunter was a much better film."
5,The B-52 Bombing?,"Of all the versions that I have seen, over the years, I still don't know why the village bombing at the end of the movie is never shown? I saw it one time only on KTLA Ch.5 Los Angeles, in the 80's. As the boat pulls away from the village you can hear the radio chatter, then as the picture fades to black, you normally just see the end credits. This one time, there is a flicker of light and the village is blasted endlessly as the credits roll. I wonder if that ending will be included in this package?"
1,New BluRay,Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
1,Crap product,This DVD was corrupt & didn't realize it until it toasted a tv w/ DVD player & a 2nd DVD player when installed.
4,great!,Coppola's film commentary just in itself makes this 3 disc set well worth the cost. The original version remains my prefered favorite version especially in Blue Ray. I'm not a big fan of change so the redux version takes a backseat.Kenneth HaftGlen Allen
5,APOCALYPSE N OW THE COMPLETE DOSSIER,This 2 disk set arrived quickly and as described. I was surprised that the description described it as used but in great shape. It arrived and appeared in new condition. Great seller.
2,Doors Shut out!,"I looked forward to this release so I could experience again the thrill I got from not only watching a great movie but also hearing the terrific score led by the inimitable vocals of Jim Morrison and the Doors. What a disappointment! The additional scenes did nothing: how ridiculous is that ""French"" scene!!! As to how they ""butchered"" Jim's rendition of ""The End"" during the finale is just criminal! Give me back the thrill of the original: it was far more cogent and powerful; this new one is a Tosser's version!"
1,A Good Cure For Insomnia,"What happens when you mix a good director with a good cast and a boring, half-baked plot? You get ""Apocolypse Now.""AN's plot is too bizarre to have even a modicum of credibility and having seen this film a couple of times, I still don't get the point of it. AN also suffers from dull and one-dimensional characters. Likewise, AN also suffers from bad directing and editing which makes it a rather difficult movie to follow.For all its potential, AN never lives up to its hype and I fail to see why it received so much acclaim. For a war movie, AN doesn't have a lot of action so if you're a war movie buff, chances are it won't hold your interest. If anything, AN is about as interesting as watching dust settle on your VCR."
2,Apocalypse Now Redux,Apocalypse Now Is a Movies. Order to watch 0.00. Or unless I need to payment.And help to buy or rent.
1,Couldn't get into it,This was the worst war movie I have ever seen and is too historically inaccurate and very unrealistic. I felt I couldn't get into it. It had a totally unrealistic plot also. I don't recommend this movie to anyone
5,"Cool, But Weird movie...","This movie was great for the first hour and pretty funny in parts, especially the part when they are envading. After that it kinda gets boring and very weird, I found it hard tring to stay awake. But that is just me, my dad and brother love the movie. Its weird but worth watching. HOO-YAH! Thank all war Verterans."
2,Overhype,"This movie (along with Dark City) is one that people like to say is a masterpiece with complex,inspiring messages. These people either need to stop pretending they are Stephen Hawking or watch more movies because this one is incoherent nonsense"
3,Self-impressed piffle,"Just what the world needs, another review of a 31-year-old movie. What struck me after seeing it again 30+ years later is how superficial and pretentious it is and how much it reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The bland protagonist in both films travels to a remote location and is the only survivor of his crew (yes, I know Lance was still alive at the end of AN, but he was too spaced out to count). Instead of a crazy computer, the main villian was a crazy Col. Kurtz. Or was he the equivalent of the monolith? Maybe both, who knows. Both films are long, slow, and fall apart at the end. Even the original soundtrack by Carmine Coppola was reminiscent of the Ligeti pieces used by Kubrick in 2001.AN is merely a collection of set pieces and famous movie quotes, all of which you can see on YouTube, so buy Go Tell The Spartans instead."
3,I must be missing something...,"I think I'm being generous. I really don't see what is so incredible about this movie. Sure, it has an incredible style and is definately a groundbreaking picture, but what about story? What about the characters, other than Mr. Sheen's lead and Mr. Brando's col. Kurtz? There are so many other important characters in this movie that seemed to be looked over. It's also a bit long, considering the subject matter. I think I must be missing something, because this movie really doesn't strike me as being all that great. It's got great style, but needs more substance."
1,Horrible release,"There is no excuse in 2006 for having to stop halfway through a movie to switch discs in order to finish it. I'm sad that I can't get a refund because at Best Buy, once you've opened a DVD, it's yours forever.Do not buy this DVD, especially if you already own the other DVD's. If you do own both, maybe you could buy this just to throw away the discs that come with it and use the package to store the discs you already have.Do not buy, do not buy,I can't say it enoughDo not buy..."
2,"Apocalyse Now, movie, did not have a choice for the English language","The movie began with a choice of which language I wish to view the movie. ENGLISH WAS NOT ONE OF THE CHOICES! The accompanying disk was set with english as the default language.Therefore, I needed to order a differrent Blu Ray of ""Apocalypse Now"". Please refer to my purchase records. This time I ordered the same Blu Ray movie but made sure it was sold directly by Amazon. That movie works perfectly. Thank you for requesting review. Reagards, Ted Simmerman"
3,"Blu-ray: Feature disc won't play, two different copies","1. Amazon customer service is great. They're handling my returns painlessly.2. I've tried two copies, bought the same week the Blu-ray version was released. Neither feature film disc will load. The other Blu-ray disc in the package plays fine.3. I'm using a 9-month-old Sony 360 player.4. I have 140 Blu-ray discs in my collection, and all play fine, repeatedly. Old ones, new ones, cheap ones, expensive ones.I'll do more research, but for now, it seems likely there is a manufacturing problem with this Blu-ray disc.Update December 6: In order to get a feature I now needed (USB playback from my Flip HD) I bought a Sony 370 player. Apocalypse Now plays fine on this player."
5,The horror...the horror,"It is just that.The very thing that would drive a man insane.This is a good question..You have to agree with Kurtz (brando)This film will hit you right in the face,right where it hurts...whether you want it to or not.""I love the smell of napalm in the morning...That smell,that gasoline smell....It smells like...victory."" Robert duvall"
2,Wish I'd checked here first!,"I bought this at a store on an impulse buy. I wish that I'd checked Amazon first as it is less expensive here and now I learn that you must change out discs in the middle of the film. (Who was the imbecile that came up with that idea?) When I saw that it was 2 discs, I naturally assumed that each version was relegated to it's own disc. It's a great film but this DVD set could have been put together much better."
3,Where's the film editor,The original film was brilliant. This version is bloated with fatally flawed pacing. The additional footage is embarrasingly bad - especially the French plantation and Playmate scenes. A perfect example of why good film editing is undervalued. Francis - your original vision was excellant. Don't second-guess yourself next time.
2,Tedious and ultimately silly,"This tiresome (153 minutes) film is loosely based upon one of the great long short short stories of all time, Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" Except for the fact that the protagonist in each is named Kurtz and mutters ""The Horror, the Horror,"" at the time of his death, there is otherwise little resemblance. The novel is a masterpiece of concise prose; this film is a wretched example of overindulgence.Those who share in Hollywood's professed hatred of war will probably find this film meaningful. Others, especially those with actual military experience should spend their time and money elsewhere."
2,"Very disappointed, ending mangled, even in ""Original"" version","The transfer is quite good and the added scenes are interesting (but I see why they were left out of the original cut). However the ending was completely changed. I understand that the ending would be changed in the ""Redux"" version, but even the ""Original"" version was altered. I bought this disk thinking I would get a new version and if I didn't like it I could go back to the classic, but no such luck. The new version has a few interesting points, but I think highly dilutes the original film's power. It ""humanizes"" Captain Willard (Sheen's character), but I think that was one of the critical elements of the original film, he is meant to be distant, inscrutable and harsh. The added footage in the ""Redux"" version ruins the character development of Captain Willard.The altering of the ending in the ""Original"" version is just unforgivable in my opinion."
4,Needs Network Connection,"When you insert this BLU RAY disk, at first it will seems like it is not going to play.Then after about a minute a status bar appears on screen. Then if you're not connected to the internet,about two minutes later you get the message ""NETWORK CONNECTION FAILED"" Then finally the movie starts.I like the feature that allows you to create your own bookmarks on the DVD. The movie quality is amazing.The ""Hearts of darkness"" documentary quality is fair to good. All other special features are good to excellent."
2,Two stars for redux five for the original,"Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original."
5,Great!!!,"Outstanding, pulls the original together. Color much better than the VHS version. More intellectual depth than original. Very telling of the times. I have seen the original about 20 times, I was very glad I bought Redux."
5,2nd only to godfather,spacy movie leaves a lot to the imagination dont get the REDUX all it has are spoilers
5,One of the five greatest movies ever!,"This is a powerful and intense movie, that relentlessly shows the pain of war and the evil of man. The making of the movie is just as insane as the movie itself. This is one of the most memorable and well thought-out movies ever. It contained everything that a truly great movie needs, powerful acting(which was helped by Sheen and Brando, and all the members of the Street Gang pt boat), amazing camera shots and colors, humor, emotion, and a killer song to almost tell the story itself, The End."
1,my god... the humanity...,"What was once a perfect film in every aspect has been butchered by it's own makers... It's so painful to see and sit through pointless scenes when there is so much texture that was once there in the tight editing, brutal violence, and depictions of war. Why instead, do we cut to a 30 minute waste of time that is debating politics in foreign language (the plantation). Why do we cut out the napalm ending and leave only a subtext so deep you need to be on LSD to comprehend it's ""hidden message""... Screw that. Screw this ""redux"" too, it's as bad as Greedo shooting first."
2,Apocalypse apocalypse,"I bought this two disc set from Amazon to replace my old standard-def copy. The picture and audio were fine until about an hour and 15 minutes into the hi-def disc, whereupon it locked up on my Sony 350 blue-ray player. I tried it on my neighbors Magnavox Blu-ray player and the same thing happened. Amazon replaced the product without question with another copy, but the replacement copy had the same lock-up problem. I asked for and received a full refund."
4,Dissappointing Ending,"Apocolypse Now starts off as a very promising movie. It gets into the pysche of soldiers very well. the disturbed feelings, confusion as to what they are fighting for etc. Having read many books about the conflict in Vietnam and feeling very strongly about it i could feel the pyschological tensions throughout the movie and could feel it build as it builds in the charachters as they go deeper into the jungle. However once they reach their destination i felt that the movie got lost in it's attempt to be an existential movie and got caught up in the bizarness of the camp to the point of making it freakish. the first two thirds of the movie are excellent in terms of acting and cinematography but the ending is very disappointing."
5,Copola's brilliant vision explodes off the screen.,"The film is revolutionary and induces a state of insansity evocative of Nam itself. Brando, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and of course Lawrence Fishburne star in this Doors (Morrison) imbued masterpiece of poetry, music, irony, insanity and explosive reality. If you enjoy movies that make you think and violence that elicit's a tear, this film is definitely for you."
3,Film Editing 101,"This extended version of Apocalypse Now is only of note for film students. The original edit of the movie is by far better. However, it's interesting to see how much of a film you can cut out and not effect the final output. I ran both versions at the same time on two DVD players. While continuity has been restored in the Redux version, the interest of the plot is lost. The longest cut scene is of French renegades holding out on their Vietnam plantation. This diversion adds nothing to the plot and contains another dining scene. The other long scene cut from the film is about Chef and Lance each making with a Playboy bunny from the earlier stageshow scene. It is totally unbelievable. Also, Marlon Brando's character seems less frightening in the Redux version because we see him in the daylight. A lesson learned in film editing.[DW]"
4,REMEMBERING VIETNAM,"This was an horrific movie with so much left to your imagination...and the helplessness of the VERY YOUNG men played by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, and so many other young actors starting out.Very goring to the soul...regarding what (even if this was a movie)the young soldiers and war correspondent have to deal with and the maddness it can, both, bring forth...and linger on....when they come BACK home."
3,Each Movie Version is split between TWO discs,"This would be a 5 star, except for one thing. Each movie is spilt between two discs! So no matter which version you watch, you have to stop halfway and take out disc one and insert disc two, to continue watching. Obviously there is enough room on the discs that they could have put each movie on a separate disc. Poor planning and somewhat irritating with a movie that is as mesmorizing at this one it. Disrupts your concentration big time!"
3,"Original, Redux, Where's the ""Good"" version?","No one seems to realize this but there are not two but three versions of this movie. The end of the original is too short and I find it unsatisfying. Redux is WAAAY to long and drags. A version called ""The Directors Cut"" came out on VHS some years ago and was somewhere in between the original and the Redux, having a longer end without the dragging middle. I don't like Redux and the original is not as great a film without the enhanced end."
2,Cool collection boring movie,"I bought this just because I'm a fan of Coppola & Brando & I made a mistake, I mean it's a cool collection to have if you like the Movie because it's an awesome case & comes with a collectors book but the movie itself is extremely boring"
2,overrated in my opinion,"I couldn't really get into the movie. But then again, I saw it when I was young. Everyone says the movie is adapted from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but that is only partially true. In college George Lucas(yes, the George Lucas) and John Milius wrote the story, but when Coppola wanted to proceed with it Lucas was busy with Star Wars. Coppola, who owned the rights to the movie through Zoethrope, rewrote the story with Milius and went ahead and directed it anyway despite Lucas. Lucas had wanted to direct the movie which he felt was at least half his and it put a strain in his and Coppola's friendship. Lucas felt that Coppola had wrecked his and Milius' original story. I would have liked to see what Lucas would have done with it and compared the two. Lucas retaliated with Purple Haze(never seen it, heard mixed reviews) which Universal renamed More American Grafitti."
2,What is wrong with these people?,"Is this a remaster?also, why not show the film in its ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO?-back in the days of 22"" Televisions I could perhaps forgive Coppolas and Storaros decision to give this a 2:00 transfer.But today, screens are from a minimum of 30"" all the way up to 50"" and more-THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO RELEASE AN in any other aspect ratio other than the original-2:35.What are these people thinking?Is the 2010 edition of the DVD 2:35?"
1,apocalypse !,i do not think this is the best vietnam war movie but it is not a bad one.i criticize this two disc set because there are some problems about it.for example in some scenes the moves are cut off and sometimes the subtitle is not fit to the sound.so this is not what i have expected.
2,nam?,"don't get me wrong, this is an okay movie. it's just that for once i'd like to see a vietnam movie where the entire cast dosn't go insane! all the vietnam movies that are out now make it look like all the people the went to ""'nam"" came back crazy!. i know some vietnam veterans and they are perfectly sane!"
5,Best war movie ever,"This movie is fabulous.It takes you from the beginning to the end without breath.At the end you ask yourself: Why?What is our limit in following order? See the ""Milgram experiment"" you will understand Apocalypse Now better."
5,"try it you'll like it,,,","I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AND WAS RECIEVED IN COUPLE OF WEEKS,IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION,AND AM VERY SATISFIED AS IT STATES "" TRYIN YOU'LL LIKE IT""!!!!"
1,Movies split up over the two discs!,"Lame. Lame. Lame. Why would Paramount put the first half of each version on Disc 1, and the second half of each version on Disc 2? This is grossly irritating -- to have to change discs in the middle of the movie. This is even stupider than when Mirimax split the movie AND the special features up onto two discs for Gangs of New York.And, yes, Hearts of Darkness should be a part of this set."
1,"What a giant, nut-filled turd...","The original Apocalypse was a dark classic, this new version just flat out sucks. The new scenes take away from the flow of the story (and are sooooooooo boring and unnecessary) - especially unbelieveable is that in this new bad version almost half of the group of army gentlemen have romantic encounters w/ playboy playmates! Ugh! Like that really happened to any of the real soldiers that served in Viet Nam. Skip this one and buy the original version instead. Apocalypse Redux is as stinky as Godfather III."
2,Please REMASTER the ORIGINAL movie!! This is [bad]...,I hate the new footage. It ruined the flow of the movie and didn't add anything at all to the overall experience. I returned this movie and I won't be buying it until the original is remastered properly. Thanks for nothin.
3,Apocalypse Now,"While not quite as intense as ""Full Metal Jacket"", and not as realistic as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Apocalypse Now"" is a great look into not only the Vietnam war, but the filmmaking of Scorescese. It deals with the stardard struggles, ""why are we fighting?"" ""What are we fighting for"", etc. Good movie."
2,"Saw it in theater, 40 minutes too long","I had never seen the movie so my wife took me to it because it is an important film. It was interesting for a while, but by the time the 3 hour mark hit, I was bored. The last scenes just dragged on. The additional footage added very little to the movie. It may be worth having this movie, but if they offer the original on the DVD, watch it instead of the Redux."
1,Just as good as The Thin Red Line,"This movie is too slow paced, and has basically no charater development; might as well see it, so you know what kind of trash people praise."
1,most boring movie,this movie is boring to watch and i fell asleep in it twice. its is overrated. save your self 3 hours and dont watch or buy it. the helicopter scene was overrated and the movie itself was just plain dull.
1,Totally bad!!!!,"First off this movie is a struggle to watch. The dialouge is inane and the movie has enough filler for a 90 min. sequel. The movie starts well and gets the viewer interested and then brings your hopes to rock bottom. I found this to be an insult of viewing time so if you want a good war movie with good appeal, see Platoon or Full Metal Jacket and leave this where you saw it."
4,Review of,"As wonderful as it is to have a chance to see a restored print of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made in a theater (not to mention the wonderful sound design, possibly the best in the history of sound in the cinema), it's too bad that it isn't a release of the original cut, which is superior. The original cut was great because, outside of the perfection of its cinematography and sound (Vittorio Storaro and Walter Murch are geniuses), it worked so well as an allegorical journey straight into the center of the insanity of war. ""Redux"" really harms the affectiveness of this. I didn't feel that any of the new scenes helped the film and a few really hurt it. Overall, ""Redux"" is slower, more pretentious, and less focused. Still, additions aside, the movie is still filled with amazing moments and it's hard to complain about the chance to see it all in a theater. But if you're gonna buy a DVD, stick with the original."
3,"Guys, come back to reality","Basically, one point here. When a film exceeds 200 minutes in length, a single 7.9 gigabyte disc is too little space for it. While I agree that branching was a good idea implemented poorly, and not just in this case, watching the single-disc Apocalypse Now Redux on a metre-sized plasma TV will have you weeping for a two-disc set. Trust me on this."
3,Apocalyptic Letdown,"After waiting a year or so for this extended-version of ""Apocalypse Now,"" I must say that I was a bit disappointed. The image and audio transfer are quite good but the additional footage (while enjoyable to watch) did not add anything to the overall film. If anything, it‚Äôs a distraction as the scenes interrupted the flow of the story line. Martin Sheen's character is shown to have more depth but his detached nature (in the original) is diluted with spurts of camaraderie in this newer version.I guess my biggest complaint is ""Why-why-why no additional features??"" Sure, director's commentaries take time to put together but at least throw the public a bone or two. The ""Hearts of Darkness"" documentary wouldn't need any cleaning up and would have been an ideal extra for this DVD. (...)Paramount sure made out with this bare-bones disc - but next time, I'll be a bit more frugal when it comes to buying their discs."
5,EWF Long Time Fan,Had the album back in the 1970's...one of the best out there. After seeing them in concert this past month (Aug 2008) just had to finally get all of their albums on CD. One of the best bands of all times...crosses over all color lines and musical boundaries. A must for your collection.
5,The G.O.A.T!!,"The elements of the universe.........EARTH..WIND..&..FIRE. By far they are the Greatest Of All Time. And, That's The Way Of The World, may be indeed their best album. They have and will always be a big part of my musical life and history. From my first introduction to them in 1974, at the age of three, to now. I am a proud owner of over 20 EWF CDS, which includes every studio album that they ever released, with some compilations.PEACE.I write because I suffer, Inc.r.l.will.sun."
3,well is no bad at all!,"This CD does not approach the vinyl sound quality sounds pretty poor bass and unimpressive brass, which is the hallmark of EW & F. Not the best possible remastering"
3,Mortal Kombat,"The game is fun, but when you are playing alone it gets a little boring after a while. This type of game is made to play against a friend(or enemy.) It's better when you're actually playing someone else so you can talk trash about crushing the other or making an excuse because you lost."
3,Good but...,The only thing that's really bad about this game is the A.I. and a few other things. No matter what difficulty you have it on it's good for like the first four fights. After that the computer somehow anticipates your every move and there's nothing you can do about it besides get lucky and manage to get at least 1 hit. But even when I do beat the game the game it freezes. I don't think you should get this unless you're an extremely good player or you have someone to play with.
5,The Best Version of Mortal Kombat 3!,"Mortal Kombat Trilogy is pure fun! It contains all of the characters from MK3 and MK3 Ultimate in addition to new playable characters. Plus, there are great modes such as 2 on 2 kombat, and an 8 person tournament, and I'm sure that it would be a fun and adrenaline-pumping challenge for even the most seasoned MK veteran. Overall, it's a great game with plenty of challenges, great game modes, and a wide selection of characters, 32, to be exact, plus a classic version of Jax, Rayden, Kung Lao, and Kano from the first two games."
5,THE GREATEST MORTAL KOMBAT GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Whew!!!!!!!!!...After being highly disappointed with the N64 version and playing it on the PSX with my cousin, I think that the PSX version is the BEST MORTAL KOMBAT GAME EVER!!!! I mean, how can you go wrong with picking this excellent title up to build up on your PS1 collection? This has Fatalities, Stage Fatalities, Brutalities, Fatalities and many others. Plus, you can get the classic MK Characters and stages. So, if you do not have this game and have either or all of the three PlayStations that have came out, I highly recommend you to pick this masterpiece up."
4,Mortal Kombat!!!,"Personally I think that this is the last of the good Mortal Kombats, I don't really kare too much for the one's with all the weapons plus the kombos were Killer in this one. I just like some of the kharacters from the new. I'm glad someone still has this game around. I only have too complaints it seems to freeze up after a 2 player game is done, therefore you have to reset it and the whole Shang Tsung loading thing, other than that I enjoy it and it brings back teenage memories."
3,Old News,"Even though this game IS fun, I must admit, this game is REALY old, especially now that the newest MK game vs. DC Comics is coming out this fall. This game is pretty fun, like I said before, but the game is almost impossible to beat and I think I only beat the game a couple times. If you want something challenging that's classic, get this game."
5,Awesome,"Basically, this is all the mortal kombats before it without the story lines. They have every single character. Noob Saibot is definately my favorite. You can also choose all the bosses from the beginning of the game. You can choose MK1 Kano and Raiden, or MK2 Kung Lao or Jax. This game is pretty tough. Especially when you fight Shao Kahn. But, he can be defeated. I have only beat him a couple of times. Just the amount of content in the game is amazing. The graphics are superb. There is some slowdown, but mainly at the end of an 8 player tournament or when Shang Stung transforms. Overall one of my favorite games."
5,Best MK Yet!,"This is the best MK yet(unless Advance or Deadly Alliance is better)! It has 32 characters. Also, it has 4 classic characters.I'm not sure about the 1-player mode, because I haven't played it for a long time since I'm ordering a new one. MKT is better than MK4.The N64 and arcade versions have some differences. There is 2 new characters, I think(Khameleon and Noob Saibot). You don't have to do any Mercys with 1-button fatals on. They gave them wrong Animalities(Scorpion turns into a penguin,Reptile turns into a chimp,etc.), but it's not a big problem.To make a long reviw short,this could be one of the best fighting games on PSX."
4,Very Exciting Game but...there are glitches,"This is a very exciting game. There are so many charachters and special moves that out does other characters. My personal favorites are Sub-zero, Rain and Kintaro. But, the documentation that comes with the CD dosn't have all the special moves for all the characters. You got to download that from the Web. Without these it is very difficult to fight Mortal Kombat. Also, In case of Smoke and Shao Kahn the special moves doesn't work properly. These are only minor glitches and should not hamper your enjoyment though."
5,A legend,"The book which launch my interest in origami in the late 60s. If not for the discovery of this book, my interest in origami would have been lost.The models are still very fresh even for the origamist of today. There is a very good range from traditional models, simple models to the intermediate stage. An excellent first introduction to origami.It contains works of experts who are not around today. Among my favourites are those by Ligia Montoya. Simple but extremely effective.Nowadays origami experts tend to concentrate on details making folding the models extremely difficult for a beginner. I prefer to concentrate on representing the subject just right with just the sufficient details to differentiate the model and avoiding the complexity of folding it.There are also models with sufficient difficulty to challenge the slightly more experienced.A must for all enthusiasts."
4,Evenflo car seat base,Great car seat base. Sturdy and fairly easy to fix. I have been using it for almost seven months now and have no complaint whatsoever. Good buy!
1,Completely unsafe,"I am a 170 lbs man and even with standing on the carseat base I could not get it tight enough. I had to use a locking clip, which isn't a big deal. I had to do this with our old infant carrier base. But even though the seatbelt was so tight I couldn't get a fingernail under it, I could move the base 4-6 inches in each direction and I could actually flip the base up so that it rested against the seat back. I put our old infant carrier base in and it was very snug...could barely move it in any direction. This is an extremely poor design and completely unsafe."
4,Great Base,"I purchased the Evenflo Rainforest car seat, and compared to other bases this base is really great. It has a leveler included on the base so you don't have to purchase an additional product to level the base in the vehicle. It is also nice how easy a carrier is able to be removed from the base all you do is push the handle in and lift up. We had an older Evenflo car seat that was given to us and it was a pain to remove the carrier from the base. It was not an easy task especially when trying to remove a sleeping baby. The new ones are much better to remove and handle."
3,"Didn't use it, too big for our smaller car.","This car seat base would be fine if we owned a larger vehicle with a little more room in the backseat. The base tends to elevate the car seat and angles it forward so that the front seat tends to be more cramped than usual. The reason I bought it was to make placing the infant car seat in our backseat a little easier since we only have two doors, but in the end it was just didn't work. We just buckled the baby in every time and left the base at home."
2,Sent me Expired Car Seat Base,"I bought this carseat to go with my Journey travel system that has the Embrace 35 car seat. THIS BASE DOES NOT FIT THE EMBRACE 35. That needs to be more clearly stated in the description! Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this base and I've lost my registery discount for this item. Also, the base they sent me was manufactured 6-1-2007 so it is expired!!!!!"
4,Wait a minute!,"The Schaum Outline Series has stood the test of time and Thermodynamics by Abbott and Van Ness is no exception. If you want to learn thermo beyond the typical undergraduate level, progressively working through the problems chapter-by-chapter in this book will do the trick.Although this book does follow the old sign convention for work (positive when the system does work on the environment), it properly follows the specific energy convention of ""energy/mass"". Thus, the ideal gas equation is PV = RT, where V has units of ""volume/mass"". Once this simple terminology is understood, steam tables can be readily used without confusion."
3,VHS Quality on a DVD,"I expected something special with the DVD version, but the quality is the same as a new VHS tape, and worse, there are no extras of any sort. If you are buying this as a collector, you may want to hold off. If you just have to have this on DVD, like I did, then buy it."
2,My Girl!,"Hi, I just wanted to say what i thought of this movie. It wasso good. The most i liked about it was how it was so realistic.It was very sad when Veta's only friend dies. She is heart-broken. Because her dad works at a funeral parlor, Veta is withdead people day in and day out. Everyday she goes to thedoctor's office and complains about how she is dying. The doctorexamines her but she is alright. This story reflects upon agirl who is dealing with death and her father's newgirlfriend. I give this movie a five star. It is SOOOO good."
4,They Sure Love Killing Off Macaulay Culkin's Characters,"What happens to Macaulay Culkin in ""Jacob's Ladder?""He dies.What happens to Macaulay Culkin in ""The Good Son?""He dies.What happens to Macaulay Culkin in ""My Girl?""He dies.Even in the Home Alone movies, they are trying to kill the little brat. Hollywood sure loves killing this kid. I suspect that it is some kind of sick fantasy as a result of Kit Culkin, the stage dad from Hell."
3,Awesome,It is veary sad. Vadas best friend dies because he stepped in a behive. There were to many bees and he was allergic to them. Also Vadas dad starts to like Shelly a lady who works for him and Vada is upset because she doesn't like Shelly. Vadas mom died when she was a baby. Vada wants to be a writter and has a crush on her teacher. Later Vada learns to love Shelly and becomes happy again. After her best friend died she was heartbroken but I think she gets used to it afterwards.
3,Is everyone talking about the same movie as me?,"I`m sorry M.C., but this movie was out of control. I really wanted to see this, but when I did I didn`t like it. I love movies, but not this one. I have seen way better. I know no one is going to say this review is helpful, but these are my true feelings about this and I can`t say this in a another way. I don`t recommend this movie. But it does make you cry. I couldn`t finish watching this movie. That`s all. :'}"
1,A good movie?! Get a life!,"Who the heck wants to see a comedy with a sad ending?! I felt worse than disappointed when i went to see it. If you ask me, I think either whoever wrote the ending lost his mind or some dumbstupidin focus group for studio executives made it that way. I definitely agree with George Lucas's resentment about Hollywood and the way most movies are written these days. Studio executives who give more of a darn about ratings than art just don't know what the stupid they're doing. Save your money for happier endings."
5,A novelty buy from a great and reliable source!,"My dog recently chewed up my old My Girl dvd, I was very upset as it was purchased for me from my sister. I was very glad and happy to see that this dvd was on amazon and that the seller delivered it at a timely manner. Needless to say the product was as described."
5,My Girl Movie,My daughter wanted this movie for Christmas and it made her xmas so much better. We both love this movie so much. Amazon has great stuff for a great price!
4,A Lifetime Favourite,"My Girl is one of my favourite movies and always has been. It's the story of spunky, 11-year old Vada Sultenfuss who grows up in a funeral home with an emotionally absent bother. Her best friend is Thomas J and she ends up losing him as the result of his bee allergy. This movie never fails to make me cry. It's a story that is easy to relate to and punches you in the gut.However, I was very disappointed in the DVD release. A big reason why I purchase so many DVDs is because I enjoy the special features. My Girl was lacking in that department and I wish they had gone the extra mile with some featurettes, cast interviews, bloopers, etc. Fortunately, the movie is good enough that I can forgive the lack of special features to an extent."
5,Gift for my 25 year old,The process was fast and efficient. This was a favorite of my daughter who is now 25. She and her sisters love this
4,a ninties classic,when i was younger i was obbsed with macauly culkin. i still do like this movie today though. Anna Clumsky is wonderful. macauly is pretty good he really dosent hasve much to do expect follow vada along and vget stung to death by bees. i agree with the viewers who said that this is a good way to introduce kids to death.if you have never scene this movie and like thsi sort of thing see it now.
4,"Even more a tear-jerker than ""Titanic""!!!!","Anna Chlumsky plays a very nice part in this movie with an all-star-cast. Vada Sultenfess's mother is dead (she's convinced her birth killed her mother), her father runs a funeral home, and her father's assistant is young, pretty... and could be her new mother. Then there's Thomas J. Thomas James Sennett, to be exact. The summer of 1972, when this story takes place, is a signifigant one for both of them. Vada's only friend, and her best friend. The only friend she also has is her former fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Bixler - who she has a crush on. Yet things aren't the same when someone steps on a beehive when the person's allergic and dies... but that person you will have to find out who!! (I promise you it is not Vada.)"
5,Reviewer,"Fantastic family film, excellent acting and strong plot. Humourous but also very real to life. The only element that may concern some parents is the girl reveals her panties getting into bed. But if a girl in her panties doesn't concern you this is a remarkably enjoyable family drama."
5,"I SO LOVE MY GIRL!!! 1,00000000000000000000 STARS!!!!!!","I LOVE the movie My Girl!! Though its REALLY sad,It's my favorite film.It's about children's love and friendship.Vada and Thomas.J are very good frinds,they have sweet feelings for each other.But the end is REALLY sad.Thomas.J gets stung by bees and dies.During his funeral,Vada runs up to his open coffin and starts crying and talking to him.She said,""Want to go tree climbing Thomas.J?His face hurts![seeing the bee stings]And where are his glasses! He can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses on!'' Though its sad don't miss this movie.It's a touching and heart warming film for the whol family."
4,My Favorite movie as a child (and still is now!),"I can't say enough good things about this movie. I loved it and have watched it repeatedly since I was 8 years old. I didn't appreciate it then but I do now. I didn't really understand the whole message of death either but I do now.Vada is a sweet little 11-year old girl. Anna Chlumsky did a great job playing her. She was also very mature for her age.Dan Ackroyd was an okay as the father in the movie and Jamie Lee Curtis was pretty good as his love interest.I thought Macaulay Culkin was very good as Thomas Jay, the shy and slightly geeky boy. He was geeky in a sweet way though. I think when I was 8, I had a little crush on him after seeing this movie. I was sad when in the movie, he passed on.And who could forget The Temptations song playing at the end of the movie? It was a great song and should have been nominated for an Oscar that year.All in all a great movie."
4,My girl liked it!,"Still a good film to see again. Well made movie that is sweet and funny. My girl said it was sad, but in a good way!"
5,childhood innocence,C I watch this movie over and over. sweet sweet film. funny and sweet childhood friends walking through funny sad childhood adventures
4,I love #4!,"I love this new artist! She's so great! ""I Try"" is a song I can relate to! All of the other songs are great too!"
1,Totally awful,Macy Gray is nothing new . She's just plain R&B and funk just like most other singers are . This album is just terrible because there's just no good songs on there .
1,a headache of bad imitation,who is she trying to be? she isn't as cleaver as badu.doesn't have L-boogies charm.or mary j's tempo.idenity is among many things hurting her.we have heard this style done a 100% times better by folks that got little or no love compared to Ms.gray.it's nothing special as is the sad case of most of contemparary r-n-b.
1,What the Hell is this?,"Excuse me, but I submitted a review 4 TIMES criticizing Ms. Gray and you guys never posted it! Here's my last try. If you are even considering buying this waste, please don't listen to all these people who claim that Macy Grey is excellent. Kudos to you if you can still bear through the first 10 minutes. Maybe I just don't like this ""different"" approach to music. She sounds like an old record being scratched. It is disgusting and nerve racking. (this applies to the CD and the lyrics)So simply put, DON'T buy this CD."
4,Finally!,"Finally, a distinct voice with a fresh sound in popular music! In pop music genres the vast majority of artists and bands in their respective genre sound strikingly similar. Not so with Macy's contribution. Her blending of styles, i.e. R&B, funk, jazz licks, blues and rock, along with her raspy yet controlled vocal styling ensures a great listening experience. 'On How Life Is' is not too hard nor too soft. Each song offers a unique mood, an unexpected ""hook"", and narrative (you'll even be able to understand the words -- what a concept, eh?). And, thank goodness, we don't have to bear any of that tired, over-rated rap! This is a great cd, especially if your musical taste is somewhat eclectic, or, even if it's not. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. Macy Gray's 'On How Life Is' is a breath of fresh air."
5,i love every song on this cd and that is rare,"every track on this album is fantastic; it's been a long time since i've thought that about an album that wasn't a ""Greatest Hits"" ensemble. nothing is worse than buying a cd with maybe if you're lucky 2 decent songs, i feel i hit the jackpot with Macy Gray."
5,You don't even feel strange dancing to this all by yourself.,"It's one of those (rare) CDs that you ABSOLUTELY LOVE - - every single song - - from the moment you play it! RUN .......DON'T WALK! Go get it...and SOON! She's like a young, hip, Aretha Franklin - with an amazing voice, great lyrics, 70'sish sound, etc. I just heard ""I Try"" on MTV last night and, like a possessed music zombie, ran out first thing this morning to get it! You don't even feel strange...dancing to this album... all by yourself."
2,I TRY is singularly wonderful...the rest is triple-X!,"I was disappointed! I adore Macy's song ""I Try"" & her voice is the most unique I've heard for years (think Tina Turner & Bonnie Tyler with a sprinkling of Rod Stewart & Joe Cocker). But most of the other cuts from this record are lackluster & downright filthy! ""I Try"" is the anomaly. Buy the CD or cassette single & skip the trash-mouth full-length version!"
4,One word: unique,"Macy Gray literally hit the charts in 2000 completely out of nowhere. Her unique sound and listenable R&B singles like ""I Try"" caught the music industry completely out of left field, and Gray herself achieved numerous nominations and awards at many award shows, and deservedly so. Though she isn't the best singer by any means, her style is consistent and deliciously unique. ""I Try"" is, of course, the standout track on her debut album On How Life Is, and it remains to be her biggest hit. The remaining songs on her record follow suit: from the revenge-driven ""I've Committed Murder"" to the soul-induced ""Do Something,"" On How Life Is remains a debut album from an individualistic singer-songwriter that is both completely original and completely irresistible."
4,Groovy,"If you're like me, you like all different types of music depending on your mood. When you're not sure what you want to hear but you want to get in the groove, this is the CD you want to listen to."
5,A 1999 CLASSIC,"This CD is a classic if you are a real music lover. But if you like most of the music you here being played over and over again on the radio, you know that music that all sounds the same and comes in three grate flavors pop rock pop r&b and hip hop pop Macy Gray might not be your taste. But for you people that are sick of hearing a lot of cookie cutter music cranked out just to make a buck you well here the greatness of this CD. An as for the people that gave Macy Gray one star, ... your just haters."
2,Ewww....,I liked her singles on this CD... and then her weird voice just got to me. Now I can't listen to the CD anymore.
5,She Tries...She Succeeds,"01. Why Didn't You Call Me (10/10)02. Do Something (8/10)03. Caligula (8/10)04. I Try (11/10)05. Sexomatic (10/10)06. I Can't Wait To Meetchu (10/10)07. Still (11/10)08. I've Committed Murder (8/10)09. A Moment To Myself (10/10)10. The Letter (10/10)That's 96/100 (96%). That's one hell of a CD, and if you really want to know what great music is, you'll buy it."
5,Amazing!!,"Such a beautiful soul comes through her voice. This CD hasn't left my player since I first heard it. ""I Try"" and ""Still"" break my heart everytime I hear the first few notes. Well worth the purchase."
5,Amazing,"I first heard 'Still' on the radio, and wondered who that woman with the amazing voice was - as soon as I found out, I bought the cd. I've been listening to it nonstop ever since. Macy's voice reminds me of an extreme Billie Holliday - AMAZING"
3,Still need more polishing,"In the past, I have had some successes with following the recommendations posted on the Amazon.com. This time, I have to say I am a little disappointed. Miss Gray's ""On how life is"" is not as good as some of the reviewers may insist. When you buy this CD, a stiker on the cover tells you this album features ""do something, I try, and still"". That's about it: 3 songs out of 10. Although I do believe ""I try"" and ""Still"" are very good, I don't see much artistic value in other pieces. I do agree with others however on Miss Gray's talent as a musician. She has a good potential of becoming big. At this point, based on this album only, however, she still needs to find a style which fits her voice. So, if you are contemplating about buying this CD, remember, you are probably paying for 2 or 3 songs at the most."
5,Buy this cd.,"Astonishing. And I don't say this lightly. I bought the cd after hearing a couple of the songs on the radio, and it was, to say the least, quite a pleasure to receive. I can't stop listening to it. ""I Try"" is a terrific song. It's the best, freshest music I've bought this year. More from Macy!"
5,All shades of Gray,"This lady has a voice that will transcend the generations...""Why didn't you call me?!"" is the answer to every Dear John letter...""I try to walk away and I stumble"", how much more can you say I love you than that!!!??She is a unique visionary and I hope she keeps it coming for years...Gotta love the HAIR!!!"
3,The best of Macy,Even it is a good album with really good soul and funk elements you can get bored very quickly to listen it.
4,"SIT, BACK, RELAX...LET MACY GRAY TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN","This album is simply a fantastic, smooth collection of mellow songs that ooze soul, love and passionate embraces of music genius. Gray is the modern Billie Holliday and the album will have you hooked. Ideal for a relaxing day, as background music; heat up the coffee pot, put the fire on and insert the cd. The hit single, ""I Try"", is easily the landmark track with ""Do Something"" also up at the top. A brilliant debut from a wonderful artist. Enjoy."
2,She's no Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington!,"I REALLY wanted to like this one. R&B music (my favorite genre) has, in my opinion, really been in a slump for many years. A fresh perspective in R&B was definitely welcome to me. Its nice to see a recording that definitely was not created soley to be played of VH1. I feel it still has a long way to go before it can be a 4 or 5 star album. With repeated listenings the songs get repetitive, and sometimes even annoying.Original reviews of Ms. Gray had her in the company of Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone etc. etc. If she is going to be compared to these greats, I will hold her to the same standards, and I dont see that she measures up. I will be interested to hear her follow up when it comes out, with her instant fame, she could greatly improve, or attempt to produce ""On How Life is, Volume II""... I'll be waiting, n the meantime I'll be listening to Billie."
5,LOVE IT !,"Simply beautiful. It took a few listenings for me to fall in love with Macy Gray's special voice, but now I love her CD from begining to end. Macy Gray truly sings ""On How Life Is"" from her heart. It's a must buy. Macy, I love you. The cd is true to heart and the music is breath-taking, and everytime I listen to ""I Try"", I Cry. That's how moving the song is. All of her songs are moving, but ""I Try""..."
4,Macy Gray -,"This album is incredible! Macy Gray has renewed my interest in music! It's the first album I've bought in years and I haven't stopped playing it since. Her original voice, great music - and words you can understand - have me hooked. Favorite tracks are: Why Didn't You Call Me, I Try, I Can't Wait To Meetchu, Still & I've Committed Murder. My only hope is that she never goes completely hip-hop. Macy - keep 'em coming!"
1,Let Down,"I heard a lot of people talking up this album on the Grammy's so I bought after hearing only the too much played cut"" I try"". I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about dragging some black girl off the shreets to prop up in front of a mike. I miss spelled streets similar to spelling ""you"" ""chu"" . Come on folks this is not even audable english. I bought Tracy Chapmans new one at the same time and WHAT a contrast. Macy Grey is going to the used dc store."
4,Just what I needed!,"I was driving to work one day trying to figure out what to tell my little boy's father how I feel about him and I hear this song, I Try, and her words are what I've been feelng and I had to buy this cd, this girl has major talent I stll have not heard the whole cd, but I think it'll be a keeper."
2,EEK!,"I don't have this CD, never will have it. I heard ""I Try"" on the radio uncountable times...damn, her voice is horrible! You can bash me all you want in your head for attacking a thing like that, but trust me, it's a big part of music...it's like listening to microphone feedback while turning up the bass so loud, it makes my intestines scrunch. The lyrics might be good, but I can't hear them. The only reason I give her 2 stars is because she tried. Well, she can't get anything positive from me. Sorry. And get a voice box operation...sure you have the money."
1,MACY IS MESSY - OVERRATED TO Nth DEGREE,"totally disappointing. this was BY FAR the most disappointing CD ever bought... i don't know WHAT people are thinking. i mean i was dooped, i bought the CD cause i saw her live (live TV performance) and thought her whole thing was different and cool. i was only right about the first part. it weas NOT cool ubt rather a horrible WASTE of money. trust me, as a singer myself, i could easily have made a better album. it was a horrid waste of money and cd materials and time in studio. her voice is horrible & her songs are stupid and unlistenable.lmj"
5,Astounding Debut.,"For a change, I feel like keeping this brief. I have wanted this album for months, and finally recently got it. This album would be worth having if only for track 4 - I Try. There are few people out there who have not heard this song, I'm sure. In my humble opinion, it is one of the most exciting and interesting singles in recent memory. What a surprise and a treat to find out that the rest of the album is equally wonderful. Macy Gray is an artist that deserves to be around for the long haul, and hopefully fame and wealth will not tarnish the spirit behind the songs on this album. Well worth the money!"
5,"A soulful, unique debut","I have to say that there are few CDs I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track or two. I couldn't believe when I came to the end of this incredible CD because it came WAY to quickly! I love the jazz songstresses such as Ella, Billie, and Sassy and listen to them frequently...while Macy Gray has garnered many comparisons to them, I think she is in a league of her own. I can't stand cookie cutter voices or songs (I won't mention any names, but the radio waves are crammed with them) so she is a breath of fresh air. I'm hoping this decade will shape up with more original sounds such as Macy's and do away with the lackluster, sound-alike acts that are out there now."
5,"Should be titled ""How Life Should Be""","This cd is incredible! Macy's voice has so much feeling and emotion, you just put yourself in her place like you went through the same things. I usually don't get into the lyrics but 2 minutes into listening to this CD I knew I had to look at them. The last time I took such notice on the lyrics of a CD was on Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill. She sounds a little like Tina Turner but has a more funky quality. I bought this cd after hearing everyday how Rosie O'Donnell thought it was incredible. My faves are ""I Try"" and ""Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak."" Buy this cd! You won't be disappointed!"
3,"A pleasure, a revelation, a joy...","There's some catchy stuff on here, and it was certainly refreshing at the time it came out.Now though she's beenovertaken by the superior technical talents of the likes of Jill Scott, and Erykah Badu's latest record puts poor Macy in her place. Worth listening to, though, and there's every chance you'll love it."
3,Very Unique!,"When I first heard ""Do Something"" on our local jazz station, I fell in love with the voice, song, and beat. I got another chance to see her perform on on t.v. and I loved it! The Latin, sort of urban rhythm to ""I've Committed Murder"" took me! All of her lyrics tell a real story."
4,so-so music for an up and coming artist,"Listening to Macy Gray's CD I can't help but feel like I'm in a blues bar. Most songs are great at expressing the feelings of this artist. Although I do not agree with the language and sexual references used, altogether it is a commendable first try by Macy."
1,Macy Gray allows explicit lyrics to get in the way.,"The music on this record is down right funky. I hear bluesy grooves with a taste of Prince.The song Why Didn't You Call Me fits this category. The best track, and might I add, should be released as a single is, ""A Moment To Myself"" You and I know there are a lot of copy cats in the music industry. If R&B artists would immulate the funky sounds of Macy Gray, Rhythm & Blues would be alive again. However, MS.Gray's lyrics are offensive. For example, the song ""Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak"" says ""Feels like an x x rated movie star"" One more. The song ""Caligula"" says ""Never lovin but we're always %**//?"" While singing like a person with a depraved mind, Macy has enough nerve to dedicate a song to God on ""I Can't Wait To Meetchu"" If she really knew God, lyrics like the one's I've mentioned wouldn't be on this CD."
2,Could be much better :P,Macy Gray is capable of much better! Her voice is just plain scartchy though.. i guess it's what makes her unique. She has a good feeling and interesting sound but the lyrics aren't too good at all
1,Oh How Life is.....,"I was put through the torture of listening to this C.D. This album is the worst piece of junk. The only O.K track on this C.D is Do Something. Macy has a really dreadful voice (like Satan!)Still is the most depresssing song ever. It makes me want to jump out of a window. Anyone who says this album is R n' B is crazy! If this album is R n' B, then it is a serious threat to the entire future of R n'B. Don't even listen to track no 3. It doesn't make any sense and is boring. A very dissapointing album. If you want to buy a good C.D by Room 112."
1,Macy Gray has no talent...,"An ""R&B icon in the making"" according to the editorial? This one album wonder will hopefully go back to obscurity in the next year. This CD is dreadful. Gray can't sing, can't write, and has no musical talent."
2,Where's a voice coach when you need one!,"A friend of mine made a tape of this CD for my birthday. At that point, I had heard only ""Do Something."" And Macy's voice to me was the equivalent of a really bad poison ivy rash. But my friend liked it (she compared her voice to Rickie Lee Jones) so I thought I'll have an open mind about the album. Musically, it's well-done. But my opinion on Macy Gray as a singer hasn't changed. As much as I liked the SONGS (especially ""The Letter""), her voice drove me NUTS. She sounds like Kim Carnes on helium.""On How Life Is"" had the potential to be a GREAT album, if someone else had been the vocalist. It's one thing to have a scratchy voice and can actually sing and emote (Rickie Lee, Erykah Badu) and another to have Macy, who simply cannot sing (she has no stage presence, either). And it's really too bad--how many amazing singers are out there who don't have record deals?"
1,haha this is music?,how can anyone call this music? her voice sounds like a female axel rose with a sore throat and a cracker lodged in her throat. dont buy this junk.
1,What The %#&@ Is This??!,"How long of a career do you think this funk diva will have, eh? I give her at the most, say, five years before she completely shreds her raspy sandpaper-on-broken glass voice. Will I celebrate? YES. Oh, to be rid of this monstrosity of a singer! Anyone who buys ANYTHING by Macy Gray does not deserve eardrums, because this ain't music, it's pure torture. What a waste of Vinyl Chloride!!! Excuse me, I just had to clear my throat. Heh-heh-eh-hack-hack!!"
4,Thinking About Buying?,"For a while, I had been debating whether or not to buy Macy Gray's CD 'On How Life Is'. I have a diverse interest in music which includes jazz, underground and R&B. Before buying a CD I always think about how it would integrate and contribute to my collection. After listening to 'On How Life Is', with much satisfaction and confidence, I decided to buy it. The debut album of a very talented artist is brimming with life and emotion. Her unique voice is a pleasure to listen to and the beats in her songs aren't just catchy, but special. If you are thinking about buying Macy Gray's CD, I would recommend it no matter what kind of music usually interests you."
4,Great CD,"I must admit I had never heard of Macy Gray until her song ""I Try"" started playing on the radio. I loved it and couldn't wait to buy the CD. I have not been disappointed. I've listened to it over and over and would recommend it highly."
5,top album this year,"I am amazed that this album has not received greater coverage in the US. It is the best one I have heard this year. Real soul, original singing style and easy to like with catchy tunes. It is one of those very rare LP's that you immediately fall in love with but you don't end up getting fed up with after 100 listens. If you thought the recent offerings from Mary J Blige and Lauryn Hill were great (and they were) this one will amaze you. BUY IT"
5,Brilliant Masterpiece!,"I loved it! Macy's soulful voice speaks to me and stirs something deep within. A smooth, emotional ride through heartache, sexuality, mortality and self awareness. Much needed therapy. Both poignant and powerful. Kudos to Andrew Slater on production. If you liked ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo, you'll definitely want to get your hands on this."
2,Eartha Kitt meets Donald Duck,"After two tracks, Macy Gray's voice became irritating. The music and rhythms were appealing, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the raspy squawking that was supposed to be singing. I would pass on this one."
2,...not so innovative.,"I didn't like this CD. Compared to JILL SCOTT, LEDISI or ERYKAH BADU, Macy Gray seems to me like a ""pop"" singer instead of an RnB/Soul queen...and then ""that"" voice too, some people may like it and some people don't, but what is true is that she sounds to me like my 85 year old gramma."
4,Great R&B,"I loved it! I considered my self a rock fan and I really didn't like a large portion of the new R&B but I feel in love with Macy Gray it is soulful and something to dance to, but not over done like a lot of the other R&B out today, she is passionate like Lenny Kravitz but a little less rock."
5,Very Cool!,I love Macy Gray! She has a scratchy voice that makes the song even better! I don't have the CD but I really want it.
4,Slightly Disapointing,"I bought this CD, and sadly, i am disapointed. With all of the hype, i was expecting much better. I do, however, enjoy ""i try"" and ""still"". This CD is good, but does not live up to it's potential. Even so, if you enjoy the unique music style Macy Gray, I would sugest ""On How Life Is""."
1,ewwwwww gross-- (...)pleez make there be a 0 star rating!,"yuk yuk yuk, this woman CANNOT SING! how she actually MADE a Cd is beyond me. all i can say is that the most annoying songs live on this cd and that voice is HORRIBLE!"
1,Dreadful music at it's worst,"I heard this album in a C.D store and i had to leave. Why? Because of the torture i was put through when listening to this C.D. I hate the song I try and still. Macy's voice is like a man who is choking! (No i am serious! )I'd also like to question Epic (Macy's record label. They obviously fail to notice that there are people in America without a record deal, even though they are more talented than Lauren Hill! I now seriously dislike the label Epic now! If you want an artist who can sing. It's Mariah Carey and NOT MACY GRAY."
1,"Worst ""singer"" I've ever heard","I heard some of these songs on the radio today.I did not know who the artist was and I thought 'what a terrible voice'.The voice is as rough as old bags, and she can't sing in tune.She makes Bob Dylan sound like the Pavarotti of pop.If you have musical taste, steer clear."
1,Macy's Gray,"This is Macy's worst album to date, as a matter of fact all of them [are bad]. Macy is using items from her old CD's, hence the name Macy's Gray. I suggest that you find someone to burn you the CD, literally. The CD is worth less than the 1 star given. Never listen to her garbage again. All of us Macy fans are dissapointed. DONT BUY THE ALBUM! IT [is bad]!!!!"
2,BOOO! Sombody get the Apollo's Sandman quick!,"Granted, you don't have to have a great sounding voice to be a talented entertainer. Fiona Apple, Alana Davis, Bob Dylan and T-Boz from TLC are a few examples of this. But Macy Gray's voice is just absolutely awful and irritating! I give the extra star rating here because of the music, but it was sadly wasted by her squawking over it! Her band should ditch her and get with N'Dea Davenport (the former lead singer for Brand New Heavies)."
3,"Macy Shares ""Life""","One great thing about having teenage sons...you gain perspective on some of the newer music. My oldest son turned me on to Macy Gray.She's funky, she's gritty, she's raw. And I like that. The tracks on ""On How Life Is"" are somewhat similar in beat and rhythms, however the lyrics she has written scan many ideas; from sex, to love to indignation.We recently lost our 14 yr old family dog, Taylor. The song, ""I Try"", has become our anthem to him. ""....try to say good-bye & I choke..try to walk away & I stumble...it's clear, my world crumbles when you are not near...""So, stay open, enjoy life, and seek out Macy Gray's debut CD!Thanks--CDS"
4,Foxy,"I like Macy Gray. Not because of her unique voice. It's not unique, she sounds just like Noosha Fox did in the 1970s. But Noosha was brilliant, so I'm glad someone else now sings like this, given Noosha seems to have disappeared from the scene."
1,AWFUL! DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE,"I bought this CD buying into all the hype and reviews on this site. Man was I disappointed, except to I Try the rest of this CD is unlistenable. Her voice is really bad except for the I try song. The music is extremely boring. I should have just thrown my $15.00 out the window"
2,Macy Gray is a lot like a cheetah,"Cheetahs are known for explosive bursts of speed that are unsustainable for much more than a few minutes. That's how I see Macy Gray. This album starts off soul-filled, firey tunes that make you think ""What a badass!"". And even the most cynical of listeners can't help but be reeled in by the poignant ballad ""I try"". However, Macy takes a turn for the worst when she goes the ""Sex-o-Matic Venus Freak"" route. C'mon. A more vulgar display of trite lyrics hasn't been seen since Green Day. This girl will not last. She's a Mariah Carey in Lauren Hill clothing. You'll have fun for a few listens and then lose interest until you see her pitifully performing on MTV Spring Break. Save yourself the shame and pass on Macy Gray."
2,I Tried...,"Two Stars for the CD, but Ten Stars for ""I Try"".I bought this CD because of the wonderfully smoky sounds of ""I Try"" and then I was disappointed to find that to be the only song worth listening to.I have a young child in the house, and profanity in music that I have personally selected is completely inappropriate. So, I have already resold this CD, but I look forward to giving this gifted musician another chance. Maybe once she grows up a little she'll also grow into her talent and make choices that will ultimately make her far more successful than in the limiting arena she has currently chosen."
3,So this is Life!,"I bought the album on the strength of one song, 'I Try.' This song mirrors love so perfectly, I couldn't have written it better myself. However, on further listening of the album I realised I'd been conned. This isn't how life is at all.In one of the songs, she writes about going to her boyfriends work and fighting with his boss. Who else has done that? MMMMMmmmmm! Not that many but hey, this is life! One song that does stick in my mind though, 'Still.'The chorus of this song is excellent. Who else in the world has felt like this after losing or trying to let go of love? Quite a lot I would think! This song applys to everyone, even when you take out the violence.Sadly though, I felt seriously short-changed with this album. I only enjoyed three of the songs on the album. I put this down to the fact that I'm not really a fan of this style of music, but then, I still saved money if I bought the three songs seperately!"
5,Wow.,"I happened to be watching MTV one night and they did the ""buzz clip"" thing and so I thought I would give this one a listen. Well, when ""Do Something"" came on, I was hooked. I finally broke down and bought it. It has become my new favorite album. I can't say enough about it. It is so much fun to listen to it. I love it."
4,Billie Holiday funkified,This is an excellent CD. Great for chillin around the house or in the car. Get it.
5,my new favorite album,"Ever since I bought Macy Gray's album, I listen to it two or three times a day. How did I live before this album? Do yourself a favor and go out and BUY IT."
4,"Fun, funky and totally groovy","Saw a clip of her on MTV and was interested enough to listen to her album on a listening station. Totally cool. Great vibe, good beats, jazzy and fun. I never give five stars, at least not until the album has withstood my time test (still putting it on in 5 years), so 4 stars is about as close as you can get to perfect for a new album. Buy it, enjoy it, groove to it. Like Billie Holiday for the 90s."
4,THIS IS A GREAT CD!,"When I bought this CD, I really wasn't sure how I would like it. I felt stupid to be buying a CD for one song (I Try), and even worse once I had listened to it! I usually listened to stuff like Mariah, BNL and Britney Spears-MAcy Gray didn't seem to fit into any of my ""normal"" categories. But then I started to really listen and love it! She has such a unique voice and singing style-there's no substitute for her! Her songs are SO catchy, but not in an annoying My favorite songs are: (of course) I Try, I've Committed Murder, Caligula, and Why Didn't U call me?. However, the reason this CD isn't geting 5 stars is because of the more annoying songs, like The Letter and Still. But give this album a chance! It's wonderful!"
4,Keep an eye out for Macy,"Macy Gray, if this album is any indication of things, will be around for years. Because she is truly talented. Not vain enough to call herself a ""diva"" (like Whitney and Mariah and every other female singer out there), she's the only singer in popular music right now who can even come close to earning that title. This album contains a tight set of 10 songs, all well-produced, well written numbers. Can't wait for her next release!Favorite cuts: ""Do Something""; ""Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak""; ""I Try"""
2,Lose the diva....Keep the band!,"Granted..you don't have to have a melodious voice to be a great artist (take Alana Davis, Bob Dylan, Fiona Apple, and T-boz from TLC for example). But this woman is just awful! I give two stars because I do love the music but it was sadly wasted with her squawking. Whoever is in charged with the music should ditch Macy and get with N'dea Davenport!"
3,Great Lyrics! Music Needs Some Work,The Lyrics and the feelings of Macy Gray are terrific. They express her feelings and are universal in content. This would be a great CD if not for the music. It is repetitive and has that annoying beat that seems to be in all R&B music these days.
5,This is music !,"This album is so new and WONDERFUL! It has been a long time since I have found an album that I have enjoyed so much!Her music is like nothing I have heard before!At first you may feel like dancing and moving to the music--but after you REALLY listen--it is totally different! It still makes you feel good, but in a different way!My 5 stars to Macy!"
1,HYPE! HYPE! HYPE!,"She has been compared to Billie Holliday, Aretha, etc. After listening this cd I only can say that her voice/songs are annoying, boring and disposable."
4,OK CD; most of it is clean except for two tracks (2 & 8),"Most of this CD has no profanity with the exception of two tracks. In ""Do Something,"" a phrase containing the ""f"" word was repeated occasionally in the background, and in ""I've Committed Murder"" there were two ""b"" words and one ""s"" word. This CD would not be recommended to very young children."
5,The Best Buy Yet!,"Having bought this CD for the sole reason of enjoying the ""I Try"" track, I've become one of the most popular people in my circle of friends - it is undoubtedly the best CD I've ever bought. Each of my friends who have heard it have asked to borrow it. I've now put a stop to that, as I haven't seen my CD in the past three months! Each of my friends have now gone out and bought their own copy. I have listened to all the tracks on countless occasions, even encountered it playing continuously on a recent trip abroad. It is the best all-round CD, raved about by so many people from different walks of life, each of whom have completely different tastes in music. The soul reaches out and touches all, male and female alike. I cannot wait for the next one - will be camping out at the CD store. Well done, Macy Gray - you've brought hours of enjoyment to a lot of people!"
5,Incredibly original and tasty,"This is a wonderful album. Although Macy's voice is different, it's also incredibly pleasant to listen to and provides a very interesting alternative to normal R&B that keeps this album worth listening to again and again. The songs ""I Try,"" ""Do Something,"" ""Still,"" and ""I've Committed Murder"" are the best in my opinion, and even the songs that on normal albums I would just skip over I still like to listen to. What makes this album great is that it is consistent; that is, it doesn't have one awesome single and then 11 other songs that just don't match up to it on any level. This is a remarkably mature first album and I look forward to Macy's work in the future."
4,She Speaks to me...,"When she sings 'get up, get out, do something'. In fact it has become a mantra of sorts. Macy Gray's music, like the music of Cree Summer and of Erykah Badu, is vital sustenance for the female spirit...I hope Macy is planning to be around for a long time, because she has made a new fan. Go girl!"
4,Fresh and funky,"With a voice like Billy Holidays little sister Macy introduces herself with an excellent R&B album that looks back to '70s soul with a funky vengence. About freeking time someone with a distinctive voice that doesn't sound like some cooing 14 year old came on the scene. This album is sexy but perhaps a few too many ballads to warrant a 5, but what the hell, buy it now."
3,Good tear jerker romance,"Given the mixed reviews, I didn't expect to like ""Sweet November"" and was utterly taken back to find myself not only enjoying the story, but bawling like a calf at the end. ""Sweet November"" is a bittersweet romance between Nelson, a workaholic ad executive, and Sara, a free spirited Bohemian. I agree that Keanu Reeves did some of his best acting here. He often seems flat in other productions. And Charlize Theron was excellent as the seemingly open woman who is hiding secrets about herself (her terminal illness). The supporting cast was excellent with special kudos to Greg German as Nelson's obnoxious fellow ad man, Vince, and Jason Isaacs as Chaz, the gay neighbor. In retrospect, the downer ending may have contributed to the bad reviews. Be forewarned, fellow viewers, the boy and girl do get together in this haunting romance, but the boy eventually loses the girl. Have a lot of Kleenex ready."
2,If you ever find yourself trapped on a plane,"you might just find yourself watching this. It was neither good nor bad. It's one of those movies that you won't feel you missed anything if you don't see it. Charlize Theron is an extremely talented actress, but I'd rather see her in interesting roles like in The Devil's Advocate. Keanu Reeves is still just another pretty face. This movie is not especially original (see: Love Story and Autumn in New York) nor exceptionally well acted, although Chaz (downstairs neighbor) and the kid whose name escapes me are great characters. The plane landed before I could see the end, and I dozed off somewhere in the middle, but I really don't think I missed anything. If you're looking for a tear jerker, rent Legends of the Fall or Last of the Mohicans. The stories are much more interesting and at least Brad Pitt and Daniel Day Lewis are pretty boys with acting talent."
3,Can't say,"I watched the whole movie for the first time in TV. After watching the movie, I COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP. I was keep thinking about the movie. The end bothered me very much. Why in the world Nelson go after her? I don't know, the ending just bothered me so much, I couldn't go to sleep."
2,not such a great movie,"i watched this awhile ago and don't remember much; just that i was feeling quite unsatisfied upon leaving the theater, and felt the movie had wasted its potential. the only great part of the movie was enya's ""only time""."
1,Turkey Rather Than One Star:,"What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough, the idea of this movie will, oppositely, sicken you all the way. Remember The Watcher (badly enough in its own rights), would be a classic comparing with this one.I am still confused why good actors like these two would take on a project like this. After two hours of viewing, not only careful consideration of choosing future title is needed, but also watching some boxing just to drive away the disgust this movie left."
2,Pretty weak...,"I'm not one of those people who has a problem with Keanu's acting. And I'm a pretty big fan of Charlize Theron, but this movie was pretty bad with a really bad ending. You can watch it if you want, but it's not really worth it."
2,the dishwasher !!,"I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell, I could forgive Charlize Theron anything), but then they lost me completely with the dishwasher!!"
2,Who can tell.......,"I have actually watched this film 6 straight times! Because the storyline and performances were so great? NO WAY!! Just the opposite! I watched it so many times so I could see the music credits at the end! I knew that Enia sang a number that the lyrics contained the title of this review. I guess I'll have to stop this review and watch the movie a SEVENTH time, because I still haven't nailed down the title of the song. One thing that Sweet November did accomplish though was that it preempted a 2005 remake of Love Story."
3,A story better left to be...,"I have heard a lot about this movie... so I expected a lot from it. Can't say it is not worth watching! It is a very nice movie, the setting is very catchy but I am not sure how can I describe what is missing... maybe I'd call the movie hallow! Maybe the story ought to have been left to be read in a book not acted!Keanu Reeves & sweet Charlize Theron did a great acting job. Great sound track of course as well as great settings.Again I must stress that such a story better left to be read than filmed. But still don't miss watching this movie to be the judge of that."
1,A travesty to Sandy Dennis and the original movie,"Only someone who has never seen the original could like this flick. It takes a wonderful bittersweet story and butchers it. No comparison. Whereas the original is full of surprises and has you rooting for things to work out somehow, and leaves you heartbroken, this slop has nothing to offer except to note that Charlize Theron sure is a looker! Oh, and Keanu Reeves sure is boring. Two thumbs and two big toes down. Skip it."
2,"Has its moments, but otherwise, yikes.","The only good thing about this movie is the guy that plays Luscious Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies, and the guy that plays Lex Luthor on ""Smallville"" play a gay couple. They're freakin' hilarious, but otherwise this is terrible. Keanu Reeves trying to be sensitive and romantic is every bit as frightening as you might imagine. He should go back to being Ted Theodore Logan."
4,sweet....,"THE MOVIE WAS DELIGHTFUL... IT HAD ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS, OF A GOOD LOVE STORY. A YOUNG MAN WHO IS SO INDULGED IN HIS LIFE, COMES A ACROSS AN COLLECTIC YOUNG WOMAN, AND SHE CHANGES HIS LIFE 4 EVER. ITS DELCIOUSLY INTERSTING, AND KEEPS YOU ENTICED. IT IS A TEAR JREAKER, BUT GREAT PLOT. WONDERULLY DIRECTED."
5,It's the best movie I ever seen,Well I saw the movie and it was grate and it was really thebest that I saw Keanu Reeves in besides the matrix and speed!!Also I like movies like this but it was sad at the end and I don't think that it should of ended up like it did. But it had to for the movie I guess that's what made it good!!
1,Sweet sleep ...,The best thing about this movie is that it finally finished and got me out of my insomnia spell. It was stupid and boring at the begining and so it didn't hold my interest enough to stay awake through the rest of it. Don't rush out to watch this - that's for sure.
2,Pretty much what you'd expect,"I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer, but definitely unwilling to pay to view it. Fortunately, it came on HBO while I was staying in a hotel, and I could watch for free. It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless. Keanu Reeves performed better than he historically has, but Charlize Theron was fairly flat. Though the premise was marginally interesting, the plot is completely predictable. One bright spot was Jason Isaacs as Chaz/Cherry, who delivers his usual caliber of excellence. It did jerk the obligatory tear from me at the end, but that's largely because I'm easy that way. Four yawns and two stars."
2,Not nearly as good as the original,I guess my title is basically all I have to say about this movie. The original was wonderful. This is just pale by comparison. Don't waste your time.
4,As good as original movie,This modern version is easier to get than the original. Same storynline but the actors here soften the story and make it easier to empathize with. Keanu is brilliant and young lady very very real. Enjoy!
5,Best Movie Ever!,"This is a great movie and one of my favorites, but make sure you have a box of tissue when you watch it!"
4,"I liked it, despite myself","This is one of those incurable disease flicks designed to make you cry. I didn't, but then again, maybe it wasn't as effective as it could have been. It reminded me of a remake of ""Love Story,"" the '60s film. Actually, it fooled me for the first two thirds. I didn't see the disease angle coming. It's a chick flick, no doubt. But guys will like it up to a point."
3,Melanchony and Sad - but Reeves doesn't cut it,"Okay, I don't like romances or chick flicks, and I think that this movie, except for the successful tugs on the heartstrings was poorly done. Keanu Reeves is great in action films (i.e. The Matrix) specifically because he can't emote much. Seeing him as a tearful, sincere lover in Sweet November was less than credible. Charlize Theron is gorgeous as always but I don't think this movie tapped her acting talents. Character development wasn't nearly as good as it could've been. The movie isn't bad as a superficial movie that was good at tear-jerking antics (i.e. deathly ill woman in love with life, the puppy returned, etc.) Jason Isaacs is always an acting treat, and the ending mildly surprised me because I thought the dialogue between Chaz and Sara was setting Sara up for a change of heart. In spite of the flaws, this is a great sad movie if you're looking for an excuse to cry."
2,Sorry: Can't relate to it...,"When we got this movie, my initial thought was: ""Let's get ready to watch a 'chick-flick',"" if you know what I mean. So I set myself in the ""Bounce"" or ""Automn in New York"" type-of-mode. For a while, I have to say, it caught my attention, and I was even happy to see Keanu Reeves deliver such a performance (improving on some of his dramatic performances from before). But, I couldn't relate to the concept of the movie as a whole: there's not a clear point as to why she has decided to face life the way she does (this, in my opinion, is one of the biggest flaws of the movie), but worst even, is the incomprehensible ending... I will not ruin it, but believe me: when you're done watching it, you'll go like: ""OK... What on earth just happened??"""
3,Sweet November okay movie,"I saw this movie and to be honest .To like the movie you are going to have to watch it over and over again. to like the movie its not a bad movie overall but , they tried and the effort was good enough for me. I liked it."
2,Fabulous,"You see, my son landed a bit part in that movie. I could watch it over and over as he is now having trouble in his life. He played the part of the big brother organizer. He was so thrilled to be able to do this. He was discovered in a restaurant where he worked as a bartender. The next thing he knew he was on his way to Hollywood where, like so many others, had his dreams dashed and heart broken. I think he could have done a better job than Mr. Reeves but that is a mother speaking.The movie? Well, I live near San Francisco, and love it as if it were a lover. I never tire of movies with this wonderful city in it. I did not forget for one moment that I was watching people acting, (my son excluded). End of Story."
3,sweet november,"disappointing - i watched the 2001 version and the 1968 original back-to-back; although entertaining, the remake just does not deliver the same romance; sadly, the 1968 version is only (just recently) available in vhs; if you're a real romantic, don't miss the original !"
3,A pointless remake of Love Story,"We already saw the subject in countless other versions, starting with Love Story and continuing more recently with Autumn in New York. Finding the perfect significant other, but she/he has a terminal disease. This particular movie doesn't bring anything really new to the theme, compared to the previous ones, except for the incredibly charming two main characters, both beautiful and good actors."
4,a sad drama love story,"I loved this movie. I thought it had some comidy some drama lots of romance and a lot of sadness/drama. But it was really good, and i loved the acting. Charleze Thron was the best Kenue Reeves was a little rusty in the biggining but in the middle got really good."
2,The best sings the best,"Ella Fitgerald is arguably the greatest popular female vocalist the planet has yet seen. The Gershwins were the song- writing team supreme, and there is no one who tops the music of George. Put them together and you not only swing, you lilt and coo, and stomp and woo.Ella can do it all with a lyric, and the pure tone of her voice brings out the essence of that musical freshness , that bright beauty which is the signature sound of young roaring twenties America."
2,Nancy Andreaasen,Andreaasen does a poor job of describing the genius of creativity. The presentation is not anecdotal or interesting though she does choose interesting people to profile like John Nash and August Kekule. She misses an opportunity to delve into the bipolar aspects of creativity and to identify bipolarity as a characteristic of many richly creative people. Overall this is a disappointing and poor read.
2,Boring Reading,"This book was a boring reading. It didn't stand the author's distinguished career nor as a good science writing. It may help to educate very novices on brain science as a whole. But it failed to give a solid answer to its main premise - where does the creativity lie in brain's multivaried structure. This book though gives some very important examples from extremely creative people's experiences, ""moments of epiphanies"". It mentions what Mozart, Poincare or similar person's description of their individual feelings when they were on the verge of some creative thought. On the whole this books failed to explain how and why geniuses are geniuses, but has not forgotten to mention that the author herself was a genius (at least twice in the book). Better books are by Edelman, Koch and Crick's books on conciousness."
5,Citrus Picker,Just the thing for reaching those high on the tree oranges. Very handy and practical. Eating right off the tree is healthy and tastes yummy. The pole picker lets you get to the very last piece of fruit.
5,Highly useful,This is a practical guide to nutritional support for the stressed companion of a dog with an agressive cancer. We could immediately exptrapolate her information to our situation.
5,A must for every dog owner's book shelf,"A friend loaned me her copy of this book when my sister's dog was diagnosed with cancer. Now that I've read it, I'm buying my own copy to have as a ready reference. This book will not tell you how to treat your own dog; it will help you devise a plan which is appropriate for your own dog and your own personal situation. The author reviews all of the things you need to consider, and shares her own decision making process by telling Bullet's story. It's a good story, one you'll want to finish. Even if your dog is healthy, buy this book, read it now, and you'll be prepared if your dog, or a friend's dog is diagnosed with cancer."
2,Help your Dog Fight Cancer,"This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject. Also a very moving story which I will read over and over again!The info on veterinarians, oncologists and web-sites is incredable!A MUST buy, also for those whose dogs do NOT have cancer."
4,Who says there's no Magic Bullet?,"When my pooch was first diagnosed with lymphoma, I vainly searched local bookstores and the internet for a personal story of success at fighting canine cancer that combined traditional western veterinary medicine with non-traditional approaches. Most resources were either strongly in one or the other camp, with little discussion of how to blend a variety of approaches. Laurie's book was different, and a savior for us, as it carefully and non-judgementally presented options for integrating nutritional, herbal, homeopathic, and traditional approaches (like radiation, chemotherapy and surgery). Along the way she charms us with her and her Bullet's very personal and brave story. The combination of science, heart, humor, first-hand experience, straightforward information and cutting-edge references will be useful to anyone confronting this disease, and is an absolute must-have for companions of cancer pups."
4,The Cowboy's Baby ... A Good Surprise!,"FBI agent Carly Mills and her baby go to Texas to investigate a baby selling ring. It's been a year since the disappearance of her former partner and lover, Witt Davidson. She finds him working as a cowboy on a ranch with no memory of his former life as an agent or of the love and passion he shared with Carly.This is a great story with plenty of longing and romance. It also had enough suspense and twists that kept me interested till the end.Linda Conrad's The Cowboy's Baby Surprise is the first in a trilogy and I'm looking forward to reading her next books."
3,Bad design,"Camera has a fatal design flaw - the zoom lens assembly is fragile, locks up and malfunctions easily. If camera is out of warranty repair costs $119. I am on my second repair, when the zoom lens breaks the third time I'll be ready for a new camera from a different manuafacturer."
3,It's alright...,"Bought this as a present for my wife. Quite nice. I used it from time to time too just to check it out. She uses it too, so I'm happy.What I like about it:- switches on very quickly- easy to use- not a whole lot of buttons- very small and light- durable metal housing- good batteries- appearance- flash seems quite strongWhat I don't like so much:- image on display freezes while focusing- image quality is not up to what I expected from 7.2 MP- low light - loads of noise in the pic- maybe i haven't figured this out yet, but the way the pix are organized on the harddisk after download is quite annoying (puts the pix in folders that are named after the date the pic was taken (how can I ever archive that?)- poor low light focusing (i guess just like any other camera with af)Would buy it again for that price (under $200)."
2,Nice and small but disappointing focusing performance,"I bought this camera because it was small and nicely fit into any pocket. The 7.2M pixels, video with audio, etc., seemed to be a good package. I also like the fact that the camera appears as just another drive when connected to a computer (i.e., it appears in Windows Explorer in the same way as a USB memory stick).After using it for a while I slowly got disappointed how often the camera misses a focus. When you shoot an easy target (a landscape or a face) then the camera just works fine. When you have more difficult situations (try close-up of flowers or multiple art objects placed at various distances on a table) the images are often out of focus.I'm also not very happy that almost everything is special: I understand that you cannot use AAA-size rechargeable batteries (they are too big for this camera) but why has the USB connector be so odd? Once you lose the Casio USB cable you are in trouble."
2,Great camera...for a while,"I have had my Casio for a year and a half now. When I first got the camera it was fine. Took decent pictures, was easy to use, was small enough. However just recently the focus has broken again. It stopped working the first time while I was in Europe, I had just come back from a weekend trip, left the camera in my desk drawer and the next weekend the focus was completely broken, it was impossible to use either the auto or manual focus to adjust it. Luckily then it was still under warranty, I sent it back and it was replaced. Unfortunately this past weekend the same exact thing happened, I had just taken a picture, turned the camera off, turned it back on and the focus had broken again. This time I am not under warranty. I will not buy another Exilim."
4,Nice Camera,"I rate it 4 stars because I'm sure there are far superior cameras out there, but I don't think you can get them for the price.I've only used the camera for about a day now, but it took great pictures of my horse, even in his stall. The flash is really good and the pictures turn out so nicely, this is my first digital camera that I've owned so I was very surprised at the quality. It's pretty easy to fidle with and pretty user friendly to me. It's so tiny, I'm afraid to put it in my pocket or in my purse for fear that it might scratch-but that's not a bad thing, it makes it very easy to carry around, like carrying around another cell phone. It took good pictures in a poorly lit horse stall, so I'm very excited to see how well it does at a horse show or at a concert (the primary reasons I got the cameara) in even darker settings. Hopefully it will do well. You may have to mess with the colors in low lighting, through photoshop on your computer, but once you do the colors turn out perfect."
3,A Nice Pocket Camera,I just bought this camera. I like it's small size and the images seem good. I cannot find a way to have the camera auto-rotate vertical images and this is a disappointment. The battery charger uses a big and bulky cord. This is in contrast to Canon's sleek wall chargers. Still the camera is very thin and make good images at a reasonable cost.
2,Worst Quality Ever,"I bought this camera and was quickly impressed by the look and ease of use. Once I started taking photos with it, it was a whole different story. The photos are very noisy and the camera will not produce solid blacks. Looking at many of the photos taken with this camera - it's unbearable, they look awful. I am so disappointed with the quality of these photos that the camera is pretty much useless now."
4,Rough start getting better,"My brother in law is a district manager for a large camera retailer. When my other digital camera died over the holiday weekend he suggested I buy this one. It was a special holiday package that came with the charger, carrying case, and 512 mg card. He said he had just bought one for his parents and felt for normal every day it was a great camera.I have had it a week. I was becoming very frustrated at the blurry pictures or not so clear photos. I don't expect Nikon professional clarity but I do expect clear/crisp photos. This wasn't happening regardless of what I was taking a picture of.It wasn't until I sat down for an hour playing with all of the settings and ""best shot"" features that I really started seeing the camera's value. I love the Black and White feature.In the end, I think this is a pretty good $200 camera and it just has a learning curve on the various settings (best shot, flash, color, and zoom) to get the quality you are looking for."
2,not worth,"you can get better cameras that too at much lesser price. Quality of pictures is not that good as you would expect from a 7.2 megapixel. It is equivalent to 5 or 6 mega pixel of any good brand like Nikon or Cannon.in short, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM"
4,wow,"I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA A FEW DAYS AGO, AND I HAVE ALREADY FOUND IT TO BE A GREAT LITTLE POCKET CAM. I HAD A SONY BEFORE , WHICH GAVE ME PROBLEMS. THIS IS WONDERFUL. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A SLEEK AND STYLISH CAMERA AT A GREAT PRICE."
5,Great Camera,"I just got this camera a few days ago and havent put it down since! This camera is very compact, sleek, and well built. Great for travel which is why I got it. When I want to go out anywhere, it fits in my front pocket."
4,yaa! woo! woo! woo! woo!,This is the greatest pac man game ever! This is in fact the only pac man game I have played that is 3 dimentional. But I give it 4 stars awesome!
3,a pretty good game,"all in all a good game, but it gets borring after a while.the controls aren't to great ethier."
4,over all a pretty good game,I liked this game alot. it was the first game we got for our gamecube. It could be longer but even after you beat it it makes you want to play again.some of the water levels where you wear flippers are to easy.The graphics are pretty good but the camera can be hard to operate. definitely worth buying.
4,What's not to like?,"Fan of pac Man or not-this game shall be worth your while!I thought that this game was going to be cheezy, since it involved pacman and wondered how Namco could pull this off. I was wrong. This game kicked ass! The Graphics are not that bad, close to being the best. 3-D pacmam never looked good. The game gets addictive fast, but it isnt the graphics that get hardcore fans wild. Here is a game that is easy to beat(Too easy I should say) and you don't have to throw your controller across the room in frustration. This game is in fact easy enough that I think this game was made for children. But don't let that stop you from buying it. Also, the game was too short and the bossess were harder then the some three levels combined. Spooky, being the last boss, was pretty easy compared to the rest. Even if you beat the game, you will re-play. I guarrentee. Buy one now or rent one and see for yourself."
5,Very Inspiring,How wonderful for someone to write a book on a topic we would all like to do but may not know how to start or ideas to get it done. This is a very inspiring and wonderful book on the importance of leaving a wonderful legacy to our families. It is fun and impotant. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
1,The movie was positively dreadful,"I didn't have high hopes for this film, seeing how it was a bomb at the box office. Now I know why. Seems they put a lot of money into effects and then just let Will Ferrell and Danny McBride kinda improv through the entire thing. They miss more than they hit, that's for sure. I imagine if you were sitting a room of half drunk frat boys, it'd be hilarious, but I barely cracked a smile through the whole thing. It's unfortunate also that the old series was family oriented and this is barely one step below R-rated humor. Skip this film (like most people did when it came out) and rent the original series instead."
2,funny but gross,There were some funny scenes that made me laugh out loud. But there were some scenes that were very distasteful and disrespectful which ruined it for me.
1,possibly the worst movie ever.,"The only ""Laugh out loud funny"" about this movie is how I wasted two hours of life watching it. An absurdly ridiculous movie, not funny, and hardly anything made any sense. Maybe I was expecting a kinda 'Jurassic Park' or 'Lost World' with some funny characters thrown in to the mix, but men in cheap monkey costumes, a T-Rex with scooby-do type slap stick expressions, and no plausible plot, I did not expect. Ok , the two seconds that the monkey suited man fondled Anna Friels' breasts were....but, I digress. All in all, probably the worst movie I have ever seen."
2,Don't expect the same thing as the show,"This is really nothing like the fun show of the 70's. The only thing similar are the idea of going back in time, dinosaurs, the character names only. The rest has been transformed into modern day sexual and bathroom humour.Remember years ago when special effects played secondary to a good script? This isn't years ago.If it's one thing I miss is just how funny comics were in the past without resorting to potty humor.If you take this an do not compare it tothe actual show, it's an ok time waster movie. But if you put them both side by side, what a disappointment this movie really is."
2,So dumb it does not even make sense,"Will Ferrel has a knack for turning a great idea for a comedy into an utterly stupid movie. This remake of the old classic is a perfect example. Mr. Ferrel plays a mad scientist in this movie, one who builds a machine that can take him to another dimension that fuses different times and places in earth's history. He has two unwitting fellows on his trip, a nerdish groupie played by Ann Friel and an unknown actor playing a redneck with some good intuition and common sense. The three of them have a hell of a trip that blows the bounds of knowledge and logic. And like any typical Ferrell movie, we have toilet humor, scenes with dangerous animals, narcotics, weird foods, and other props found in a slapstick comedy. But some scenes were just too dumb, like the part when Ferrell's character passes thru the digestive tract of a T-Rex, and comes out with his hair in perfect condition."
1,really bad movie,hi Hate this remakewhy did they bother making this movieif they we're not going to do itright. thank god i only watched it on hboi am so glad i didn't buy itTerry
1,Negative five stars,"This has to be one of the worst shows I have seen in years. I bought it on sale thinking if it is only rental worthy I did not spend to much more then that to own it. Bad idea, it is not even worth the rental/PPV fee. I don't consider Will Ferrell to be a good actor at all but I had high hopes that this would be at least a B movie given the shows roots from a 70's series, it is not, it was a total waste of time to watch it. If someone really wants to see it I would advise to wait until it is free on TV, it just isn't worth money to watch."
3,Have To Be A Fan Of Orginal Show,"As my childhood began in the 1970's, I loved watching the original show. The remake in the early 1990's was good too. However, this movie can't appeal to the general public.I never watched it, until I bought the DVD. The acting/comedy was weak; the storyline respected the original show. As a fan of the original show, the movie appealed to me. Other than that, movie fans will call it a dud.Will Farrell did his best, but it couldn't save the weak comedy. He was a fan of the original show and looks like he had fun. The only salvagable part, was they made it home. Unlike the TV series', it left fans hanging; as to whether the Marshalls/Porters made it home. (Rick Marshall made it back, but Uncle Jack was stranded). Appeals to original fans, but not others."
1,Pathetic,"Pathetic might actually be giving this film too much credit. As I watched this movie I kept thinking ""This is supposed to be acomedy, somewhere along the line there just has to be something in here that is funny, not just stupid."" Well, I stand corrected.There wasn`t. That about says it all."
1,Worst TV to Film adaptation ever,"I don't know who these shill reviewers are writing for the studio. This was the worst film of the summer. I am a HUGE Land of the Lost fan and this was not what fans wanted. It was not what anyone wanted. It was sophomoric, crude, and indicative of all the grist mill garbage that is spewed out of Hollywood these days. With such a big budget and a loyal fan base this film should have been a great nod to the original show. Rather what we got was a nod to ridiculousness. The original show, if anyone cared to watch it, has some very intelligent plot lines and was quite creepy. Will Ferrell went through the intestines of a T-Rex. Comon?Any execs reading this? The film was terrible. Hire some real writers next time to bring a serious version of this to the screen. This could have been the best thing since the Matrix. Unfortunately it was the worst thing in 20 years. Anyone who likes this film has lower than low standards."
1,Not for kids or even teens,"There were a few almost-good moments, so we kept watching even after the smut-meter went off the charts. Too many foul words, too much crude humor, and at times it didn't even make sense."
3,This is a Will Ferrell movie!,"I'd like to give this movie 3 1/2 stars. I can't believe all the 1 star reviews. I watched this with my two teenagers and we found plenty to laugh at in this movie. No one should have expected a serious action/adventure move with a few laughs. This is a Will Ferrell movie! It's goofy and kind of rauncy, but it is funny. Someone complained the T Rex was inconsistent. Come on people, loosen up! The T Rex understood English in the first scene it was in. How hard do you want to think about this???!? I agree it's not for small kids, but nowadays PG 13 seems to be aimed at about 16 and up. If you're going to let kids watch a movie you pretty much have to do some research."
3,Could be worse.,"This is an OK movie. Not the best. And yes, it is cheesy, but just the right amount. If it were a no name cast, I wouldn't have gotten it..But Will Ferrell and Danny McBride keep it from being a total bomb."
1,... really?,"Will Ferrell has been in some hilariously wonderful movies. Elf, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory... but this movie is NOT one of them. It was just... holy mother of god! Yes, this movie was supposed to be funny... but it failed on pretty much every level. The acting is awful and so is the writing. The only reason I saw this was because it was playing on TV several nights ago, and I am glad I did not pay to see it."
5,"Amusing movie, Purchased it for Child's Play Charity","I watched a downloaded copy of this movie a while back while we were on a trip. It's definitely a family movie and has jokes that are aimed at a fairly wide demographic. It's a pretty funny movie, super cheesy but I think that was intentional. Not like the original series was an award winner. It's a great movie to watch on a weekend if you just need something mindless and funny.I actually purchased this for an Atlanta hospital participating in the Child's Play Charity ([...]) It was very easy to do and hopefully it brought some happiness to the people there."
1,An Insult to the Original Series,"The original series was a cool Saturday morning sci-fi show that the whole family could enjoy. This movie is a wasteland of bathroom humor, sexual jokes with even an ""F-bomb"" thrown in. Sid and Marty Croft should be ashamed of themselves. I am so happy that this movie was the worst bomb of the year! FYI, I have no problem with adult humor, but I do have a problem with them taking kids shows and converting them to fart and sex comedy fests."
3,reviewing Land of the Lost movie...,"This product is in decent shape except for ""one skip"" experienced during a third viewing. Disc has a couple of scars, but seemed to be working fine until the skip..Edwin Newton"
4,very amusing,"had slow moments in the beginning, but picked up quickly. my 5 kids thought it was amusing to watch."
4,Will Ferrel classic,"I like the movie a typical Will Ferrel movie, funny yet odd. if you like Will Ferrel's movies you'll like this one."
2,Out LOUD Laffs,"Gag-reel type out-loud laffs abound, with second-grade humour. Not one of Wills better movies - this one will have you farting and giggling - or both - throughout"
4,Open your mind -- It's funny!,"We watched this movie on our DVR, kept it around, watched it again, and then again, and then again. By the third time, we found it to be really funny and my family still quotes the movie all the time. It's not 'Black Swan' but life's too short to ignore this movie. I only wish they'd do an 'Extras' version but that's probably not going to happen."
1,I LOVE WILL FERRELL!!!!!!!!!!!,"But this movie was BAD! I loved Land of the Lost when I was a young, easy to please youth but if this movie was meant to duplicate that series or even to mock it in a funny way; then it was a poor job. I even finished watching it, forcing myself to do so like a child forcing down their vegetables. I feel two regrets as of this moment. 1.) I hate to give such a rotten review to a movie whose star actor is someone I admire. 2.) I wish that I wasn't one of those people that believed in ""Just say No"", because I really think that I would have enjoyed it while under the influence."
2,"the good, the bad, and the ugly","The Good: Will Ferrell and Danny McBride make the most of a bad movie. Their dialogue is hilarious, and they execute their jokes well. These two actors are the film's saving grace.The bad: The sets are both modern and retro. Some special effects are great, while others look like they were stolen from the original TV series. I'm sure the campiness is deliberate, but it just feels weird when combined with more modern special effects.The ugly: The film can't make up its mind. It's like they wanted to make a film that attracted adults but was still suitable for kids. The result is that they ended up somewhere in the middle - too much adult language and jokes to make it appropriate for kids, yet not enough substance to appeal to teens and adults.The film ultimately fails because it tried to make a modern adult version of an old kids show, and it was a half-hearted attempt. If you're a diehard Will Ferrell fan, you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Two hours of my life wasted,"If you are a fan of the original TV series you will be sorely disappointed. This movie bears little resemblance to the TV show other than character names and some sleestak. If you are not familiar with the TV series and have no expectations then you might find it mildly entertaining if you have a ""simple"" sense of humor. But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb."
2,Blech. Will Ferrel movies continue to get worse and worse...,"Remember when Will Ferrel used to be funny? I do. What happened? Will he just agree to do any movie that comes his way no matter how witless it is? This movie is a dog. All of the humor is crude and unimaginative, and if you were ever a fan of the original series, you will likely be turned off by this dull ""comedic"" reinvention of the Saturday morning classic. Glad I got this movie from the library so I didn't pay anything to watch it. Skip this one for something worthwhile - unless you're into comedies that aren't funny. In that case, you won't be disappointed, as I was."
1,Terrible and a waste of time and money,"This is the worst movie you will ever watch...no plot, no story, terrible casting and nothing to do with the original series. Ugh. It sucks."
2,TWO STARS FOR WILL FERRELL!......AND THAT'S GENEROUS!,"Well I guess I didn't expect much from a film based on a low budget Saturday morning TV show, but this has got to be Ferrell's worst film to date. Sure the effects look pretty good with some nice dinosaurs and the Sleestaks, but the jokes that work are few and far between. If not for Ferrell, I don't think I would have laughed at all. Not only is the film bland, but it doesn't even know who its audience is, with some jokes that are very juvenile and others that are crude and may not be suitable for younger viewers. I'm not saying its unwatch-able, but there are so many better films out there than this boring turd. I didn't expect much, but with Will Ferrell I at least expect to laugh!"
1,Utter disaster,"Awful, unbelievably stupid, boring movie. The kind that makes you think about hitting the Stop button after 5 minutes, and end up doing it after 15... Don't be misled by those enthusiastic critics. This is definitely a complete and frustrating waste of money."
2,It's funny if you don't watch Will Farrell,"There are a lot of funny moments in this film but none of them belong to Will Farrell. I wanted to like the film and to like him, but he just wasn't funny. Watch the action going on all around him, instead and you will have some laughs. This could have been a good movie but it was too much about Will Farrell being certain that he's funny and stopping the movie to prove it to us... over and over and over."
2,It's an okay movie,Has enough funny parts to keep you interested and before you know it the movies over.
1,One of Will Ferrel's better movies,"Thank God it was free. If I had to pay to see this movie, it would be like flushing your money down the commode. Although it is Will Ferrel's better movies, it does not reach the level of being a real funny movie. My suggestion is, just borrow it from somebody rather than spending your well earned money on a almost totally worthless movie. It will probably be in the bargain bin at Walmart. Two thumbs down and one star on Amazon from me."
5,funny,I thought the movie would be stupid. But it was so freaking hilarious. And effects were amazing. I loved it. A+
1,What a waste of time!,"OK, I was looking forward to this movie, because I just love Will Ferrell. But this movie is plain and simple stupid, boring and so not funny. Don't waste your time or money."
2,What a dumb movie,Rented it for my grandson. It is stupid. Would never watch it again. Not a will Farrell fan anyway and this movie is one of the reasons.
1,Tank Girl was worse,I'm not sure who the makers were trying to impress with this sad excuse of a movieMy review title sums it up
1,"wrong item sent in post, avoid!!!!!!!!","Ordered a totally different item, one with plain red no stripes, except those on the shuolder, and a white logo, and i received this, probably best avoided.."
1,So What...a waste of space,"Jack kerouac's sexuality...ummm...a subject for a book on his life. I read it through. There isn't anything new here if you read or listen to any of the Beat novels, poems and journals. It's interesting that in Kerouac's ""Vanity Of Duluoz"" the dedication page states ""Extra special thanks to Ellis Amburn for his emphatic brilliance and expertise"". It's pretty evident what drove Jack to write. It's all in his books. ""Dr Sax"" comes to mind. One good place to look for the real Jack Kerouac is not with this waste of time book but at a clip of him reading on the Steve Allen Show...look at his face when he finishes...closely. It said more about him than a thousand pages of bio's and bad press."
