5,Miss Pumphius,"This is an excellent book. The prose and illustrations are beautiful. Through the adventures of a little girl, growing into a young woman, then into an old woman, this book lets children see that they can do something to help make the world a better place. I use this as a teaching tool in my 5th grade classroom. As a result we made and sent Valentines to soldiers in Kuwait--we also invited our school to participate and as a result sent about 300 valentines overseas. Even children can make a difference in their world."
2,Lupines are pretty if you don't mind spreading invasive species,"I believe Lupines are an invasive species, are they not? So while the flowers may look pretty, Miss Rumphius is really not doing the world any favors by scattering seeds for plants that will outcompete other ""pretty flowers"" that are native to the region. This may not have been known or understood at the time the book was written. While it's hard to disagree with the general sentiment of the book, it fall short of presenting a good example of how to leave the world better than you found it. Don't mean to be snarky, but between this and the wooden Indian issue mentioned by another reviewer, this book's message seems to be overshadowed by its misguided examples. Maybe in a few more decades the story will be so obviously outdated as to be quaint, as is the case with many much-loved classics in which we recognize but allow ourselves to overlook their flaws."
5,Miss Rumphius,"Great book! It has a wonderful message on doing good for the environment and for mankind, but also touches on family and on how life is a continuum, and on how to ""pay it forward."" Overall interesting story, beautifully illustrated, with the kind of message I want to convey to my grandchildren! The story and pictures kept their attention (at 4 and 2), as well!"
5,The Lupine Lady,"Miss Rumphius, by Barbara Cooney, is about a girl who becomes a lady. She wants to go to far away places and live by the sea. Her grandpa said that there is one more thing that you have to do. She was told to make the world more beautiful. She was able to do all 3 things. She is very interesting because she did all 3 things. I think it is a good book. I like the pictures, the things she does, and how she makes the world more beautiful. I think other people should read this book.By Raina C.Miss Rumphius, by Barbara Cooney, is about Miss Rumphius who was told to make the world more beautiful. First, she went to different places. Then she found a home by the sea. Finally, she was able to make the world more beautiful. You will have to read the story to Find out how. You should read this story, because it is a good story. I liked the part where she found out how to make the world more beautiful.By Rachel W."
3,"It's a good book, it's just not one that grabs me","First, let me mention that this is a pretty wordy book. Maybe a bit too wordy, because it does seem to drag on in parts. I'm constantly cutting out a paragraph here or there because it doesn't add much to the story and I really want to get on with things anyway.And, you know, it is a nice story - about a woman who ""makes the world more beautiful"" by planting lupines - but there just isn't much to it.It's not very compelling to me. We read it only occasionally."
3,OK,"Beautiful illustrations! But the story in itself is a little bland. Sure, Alice Rumphius is very noble and ends up following her heart and listening to her grandfather, but... Somehow i was left wishing for more. Maybe some drama?"
5,I LOVE This Book,"As a Pre-K teacher I read this book to my 4 year-olds and each group of children loved it. I've read it many times now and each time I read it, I get a really good feeling from it. If you're a parent looking for a good, thoughtful book, this is one of the best. If your child is four or five, you might want to break the reading into two or three parts; leave off at a really good part and you'll keep your kids on the edge of their seats waiting for the next reading. It always worked for my little ones. This story gets them thinking-great discussion book."
5,Inspiration for all ages.,"Duing a summer past I had the joy of discoveing this book at a local library. My friends and I were home from college and hd spent the afternoon reliving our childhoods in the children's section reading aloud to each other. When Miss Rumphius began, both the story and the illistrations had us captivated. I recommend this book to readers of all ages, who still believe in the power of love and imagination."
5,Miss Rumphius,"The narrator's great aunt, Alice Rumphius, wanted to travel the world and do the one thing her grandfather told her she must do. He told her she must do something to make the world more beautiful. Miss Rumphius travels the world and comes back to live by the sea where the story began. She discovered her way of making the world more beautiful was scattering flower seeds so everyone could enjoy the beauty of the colorful flowers. The story ends with Miss Rumphius telling her great-neice that she must do something to make the world more beautiful.Teacher Notes: This book would be excellent to read if you were doing a unit on plants or the earth. Even though this book is fiction, realistic things happen like the wind and birds scattering flower seeds. Kindergarten and first grade would enjoy having this book read aloud to them. Second and third graders could read it on their own."
5,Great Inspiration and I Love The Lupines,"I discovered this book in the mid-1980s when I was an elementary school librarian in Pasadena, Texas. This book was in the biography section of the library because it is based on a true story. I was attracted to this book because the Texas Bluebonnet is the state flower. Each spring I would read the children ""Miss Rumphius"" and we would talk about the beautiful blue flowers.I also liked this book because Miss Rumphius just happened to work as a librarian and she loved books. This is truly the best ""librarian story"" that I have ever read."
3,Miss Rumphius,"Miss Rumphius is about Lady, who when younger traveled all over the world just like she told her Grand-father she would. After she traveled many places she hurt her back, so she moved into a house by the sea(also like she told her Grand-father she would), she also planted Lupines(which she loves) and just lived life to the fullest. She was told that she also had to make the world more beautiful.This is a very good story that says that the simplist things make your life and world a better place. I would recommend the book to everyone, it is a very good read.Lynsi"
2,Compact Dictionary,"Maybe my mistake, the dictionary is too big - I chose one with a CD and that did not come with dictionary. Not blue words as expected, simply dull black and white."
5,Great!!,I got these to wean my daughter off the nipple shield. I wore these all the time the first day and by day two she was latching correctly and off the shield. I say these are the best thing for a mom trying to breast feed with inverted nipples and I have tryed everything this is the only thing that helped!
1,Not for me!,"I have large breasts with flat nipples. With my son, I tried these nipple shields several weeks before he was born under the advice of my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the moment I took them off, my nipple would return to its flat state, and my poor son could not latch on. I had better luck drawing out my nipples with the Medela Breast Pump (the Pump in Style) prior to getting my son to latch on. Unfortunately, in the long run, nothing seemed to work.. and I ended up eventually feeding him formula after pumping for 6 weeks. Hope they work for you, but don't be dismayed if they don't."
5,SEXUAL ROCKS!,I think this song ROCKS! Amber has a great voice and its a wonderful song to dance to!
5,A GREAT romantic dance tune...beautiful writing. . . . ! !,This song makes me dance...move and sing along with it. It is so meaning full for ones who are deeply inlove. The words and there meanings are amazingly put together...so sweet. I love this song...I'll Never lose interest in this song. It reminds me of how I feel about my boyfriend and how I see him in the sense.
5,You won't be able to sit still. This song jams!,This song makes you want to dance and party! Best dance song of 1999
5,Highly recommended from someone who doesn't recommend much!!,"What else can I say? It's a must buy! You don't believe me? You obviously have been sitting at home playing with your 8-track still. You need to go out and hear this incredible song, especially at a club with someone really close to you!! HEHE!"
4,Bought it for Thunderpuss Mix & Dub...,Worth buying only for the Thunderpuss mixes (Club + Dub). Fast BPM with strong beats makes it a 'very club' song. I bet it was a big hit when it was released. Other mixes are not good enough if u r an experienced club music fan. They r really nothing special. Anyway a 'must have' CD for every club music fan!!!
3,Good tool with some inherent problems,"This is good, reliable, nice-looking tool. There is one design flaw however - buttons get pushed too easy - when the pen is in the pocket or in a bag loop. There are also two trade-off features with good and bad signs, First, the pen is nice metal. Nice and sturdy, but it makes it very heavy and tall. Not the one to wear in a shirt pocket! Second, the clip is firm - will hold securely. But also hard to slid the pen down the pocket. The clip drags the fabric."
3,Laser Pointer,"Of course the best feauture is that it 4 things combined.Plusses:1.No problem with any of the individual items, the laser works fine, nice light, good pen and good pinter...2. Stylish, nice to show off with.Minusses:1. Uses a lot of expensive batteries2. The pen tends to dissassemble itself when carried loose in a bag...batteries then fall out etc..All in all...let's call it a real good gadget for the gadget lovers."
2,Disappointed,"Works great except the batteries burn out very, very quickly. Considering it uses watch batteries, that's way too expensive. Don't like this product because of that."
1,unsatisfactory,"unsatisfactory----no packageing, instructions, and only 3 loose batteries. Also looks refurbished and not new."
2,"Good idea, marginal execution...","The idea of a 4-in-1 lazer-light-pen-stylus gadget was too good to pass up. Now that novelty is gone, reality is; poor battery life, marginal construction, pen & stylus get ""stuck"" requiring constant disassembly & coersion. All in all a good idea, but I'd say pass & save a few dollars & headaches."
3,The ink did not last,"This is a cool item, but the ink in the pen did not last for even one day. Other than that, I have not had any problems yet."
2,Oy Vey,"I usually love assigned school books e.g. charlotte doyle, maniac mcgee but this one made me want to curl up inside of my desk and sleep. There are some worthless parts to this story, and though a very interesting and amazing topic the main character was lacking. With some strange plot twists (remember me by these persimmon seed buttons! [what was that about?]) and some boring bits ( being stuck in a tree for more then one chapter) This book is not my favorite."
3,My opinion,"This book wasn`t the best book a lot times it was confusing.It also tened to be boring and it went really slow I wanted them to get home sooner than they did. It didn`t say that much when they were home. I want to know more about the house they were moving into also about rosellen and davey.I liked story it was telling over all but,it skipped aroud a lot.I also lot though it was to much contry talk but if you like that it could be a great book.People have differant opinions."
3,Ali's opinion,"This book has a very good story but it is boring in some parts.Some one should read this book because it is a story that is sad,funny,and in between.Some one should not read this book is they are looking for something quick to read.A historical-fiction person should read this book because it's all about the Civil War!I don't want to give it away but my faverote part was when Rosellen & Hannalee put a bonnet on Hannalee's little brother,Jem.My faverote charater was Hannalee because she is determand and kind but she is also strong both fisacly and mentaly."
1,Please Turn Homeward Hannalee Already!!,"My 5th grade class a few weeks ago started reading this book and right after Hannalee left Georgia I wanted her to go straight back to Georgia already. This book to me was not very intrigueing. I suggest you don't read this book, but if you still want to you, your going to take a lot of time up in your life to read through this boring book."
1,Horribly written,"This book desperately needed a thorough editing. The writing is dull and repetitive, and the lumpy structure simply does not work, including multiple repetitions of the same scenes, long and uninteresting ""character development"" scenes that flop around, and inexplicable jumping back and fro between timeframes. The book is boring -- after slogging through about half the book I started jumping entire pages ahead to reach the end, which is ridiculously flat. The characters are uninteresting and confusing. And the prose is banal -- even scenes that could support exciting changes in pace are poorly written. This is undoubtedly the worst book I have read in years and I felt cheated by the glowing reviews that were simply misleading."
4,Good coverage of vocabulary and skills,"In my job as a middle school teacher, I have a new responsibility. Our school has recently implemented a series of ""exploratory"" courses allowing students to have exposure to a wide variety of subjects in 6-weeks rotations. I teach French for three weeks, and then I switch to Spanish with the same students. This resource is very helpful to increase vocabulary and skills (such as posing questions and conjugating verbs). Also, the Spanish version of the same resourceSpanish, Grades 6 - 12: Middle / High School (The 100+ Series)(author Rose Thomas) is a mirror of the same images and workbook pages, so it serves as a nice resource to connect between the two subjects for my students and me."
5,Really great resource for French Tutors,"I purchased the ""beginner"" workbook for 10 year old I tutor and her vocabulary is growing exponentially! Such a great teaching tool, I'm hoping they have more workbooks for young French learners!"
3,works pretty good,"Gets out most stains, but does not seem to touch any stain that may have a pink or reddish color in it. My carpet is tan, so I'm not sure if it would be different on another color carpet."
5,DiDi 7,I can't remember a time that I was more pleased by a product. DiDi7 took care of a red stain on my carpet that no other product could. I used every other leading product to no avail then I purchased DiDi 7 and was literally blown away by how easy and quick it was to use. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a stain problem.
1,DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I ordered Didi 7 from this seller over 3 weeks ago and after 2 weeks,(had not received yet) I contacted them and got NO REPLY. I filed a claim with Amazon and they cancelled the order and I got my money back. On another note, I did some research on Didi 7 and it turns out, several years back, Didi 7 was created using a recipe they had stolen from a stain remover called ""OFF""! OFF can be found nearly everywhere in big grocery stores and big retailers for about half the price as on here. If I wanted a product from ""TV"", I'd buy it through my TV or better yet, wait a few months and get it at my local Walgreens!! Stay away from this so-called-company...."
5,This stuff is amazing,"I have used DidiSeven for years and it is amazing. If you follow the instructions, it will take out stains that you cant get out any other way. My favorite use is taking out ink. Also, it takes out rust stains when you use lemon juice to wet the area. When you rub on the DidiSeven, it just makes the rust disappear before your eyes! It smells funky, but works great!"
1,Unhappy consumer,"I used this product many years ago and it was excellent. This ""new"" product did NOT take out ink or blood stains.I am not pleased with this overpriced product."
4,Slow to hatch,"The sea monkeys did not ""instantly"" hatch as the package & directions indicated. We waited 2 days & then gave up on them. However, we did not dump the water, and about a week later, we finally noticed sea monkeys swimming around.Since that time, we have continued to follow package directions, and the sea monkeys have grown & done great. My kids have really enjoyed them!"
5,Perfect for winter travel,I bought this for my daughter because we really didn't have any blankets warm enough for the rough Chicago winters since our daughter was born in the middle of July. It has been washed twice and each time it got softer. I looked at the Koala Baby fleece blankets but I liked this better because it was more girly and it matched her crib bedding. She fell asleep instantly in my arms when she was wrapped in this blanket.
4,Autism - a non-clinical case study,"A first read this book in the 1970s when I was about 16 and was very much impressed with the story of Ann. I knew nothing of Autism and didn't understand the book to be advocating a certain way of dealing with Autism, but rather promoting the story of a family that had worked to achieve so much for their daughter by integrating her into the society we live in, without medical guidance, because none was available. It was clear that the smacking was not something they really would have chosen, had another option with similar results been offered. The book itself is of its time and when I re-read it recently I could pick a whole load of faults in it. However, I was left with the impression that what her family chose for Ann was a better option than the alternative at that time - institutionalisation and sedative drugs."
4,It's A Great Cd Player,"Man I don't know what the previous owner is talking about. I owned the cd and it's a great cd player. I had no problem from it. But if you want a super cd player and you are willing to spend money, get the sony xplod cdx-m630. And I owned that cd player too and it's amazing."
2,"Great movie, bad format","It's wonderful to see Hou Hsiao-hsien's films available on DVD at last, given how difficult it is too see them in theaters, and this is a fascinating and rewarding film. But FoxLorber have in their wisdom decided to present it in fullscreen only which is a big, bad mistake because (1) With DVD you'd think they'd at least offer the choice of fullscreen vs. letterbox, and (2) Isn't it likely that most people who would bother to buy this DVD would want to see the film as originally intended by the director? Very disappointing and I will stick to my PAL VHS widescreen version of this movie instead."
2,Stinks,"I got this book from the library. I'm a beginner to wire work. I do mostly seed bead work. I can make spirals now (per her instructions) but I can't link them so they look nice. My bookmarks just didn't work. My caged spiral is garbage. My leaf shapes, none of them look the same. I hate this book. I'm getting my Thing-a-Ma-Jig out and I'm going to the WigJig site for some good help. This book has some really pretty stuff. None of which I have been able to duplicate very well. She doesn't address the issue of how to create pieces with some measure of uniformity."
3,BEWARE ! Scenes of Animal Slaughter !,"I loved this movie but please Beware....there are horrible scenes of animal slaughter that I found so disturbing I am going back to being a vegetarian ! So horrible that I could not sleep well the night I watched this movie and had I been forwarned I would not have watched it. There is no mention of this anywhere. There is also a scene where a goat gives birth to 2 stillborns which was so sad. Yes, I know...such is life yet I still wish I had been warned. The rest of the movie was so touching and enjoyable I experienced these scenes as a big ugly scar on the rest. I just want to warn those of you who might feel the same."
1,Nauseating Animal Cruelty,"This film contained scenes of gratuitous animal cruelty that contributed absolutely nothing to the story line and would make any decent person sick to their stomach. Hanging a screaming pig upside down from a forklift, shooting it in the head, and slitting it's throat. A cow was killed as it looked directly into the camera. I didn't know cows had expressions, but after looking into it's face as it died, it is something I doubt I will ever forget. And the two still born goats? How do you suppose the Director managed that? Killed a female goat and two newborns, gutted the ""mother"", and pulled the dead fetuses out through her dead vagina? If you are the kind of person who enjoys watching animals suffer and die in the most direct and in your face manner, then by all means buy this film, it was made for you. Otherwise, save your money and make a donation to the SPCA or Humane Society."
1,I didn't like this film.,"I am not sure how so many people thought this movie was good. The cinematography was not as good as many people reported, the story was so so, and it just wasn't an engaging movie. There are better ways to spend 103 minutes."
4,The Girl from Paris is Superb!,"Great characters! Great story! Great scenery! It made me want to move to the Vercors in France - the Rhone Alps are beautiful! If you have ever thought about getting away from city life, this movie shows that doesn't mean ""getting away from it all"". Michel Serrault is terrific as Adrien, the old goat farmer, who wants/needs to retire and sell his goat farm. However, he resents Sandrine (Mathilde Seigner), who buys the place with the condition that he is allowed to live there another 18 months. It's interesting to see how his feelings of hostility turn to...well, just get the movie and watch it. You won't regret it."
3,Unknown facts about the suffragist movement,"Before reading this book, I thought women's suffrage was only about a group of when marching down a street asking for the right to vote. This book gave so much insight into the movement and five of its most prominent leaders. It does a great job of showing all the different angles and reforms that the suffragists were pushing for. I recommend if you are interested in a more in depth look at what was going on in that time period."
2,"Nice overview, but very simplified and watered down.","Sisters offers a nice introduction to a very complex subject matter, however its brevity is also its downfall. The author explores how the personal lives of these women influenced their involvement in the movement, which while fun and captivating to some, offers little to scholars familiar with the suffrage movement and its many, many activists."
4,Opening Doors,The book provides a great overview of some of the primary voices and personalities in the suffrage movement. I had to read this for a class on Women in American History. I enjoyed it - found it a smooth read and it has elevated my curiosity to read more about some of these women. If you are interested in women's history; particularly in the US - I would recommend this.
3,Left Wanting,"The author does a good job with telling their stories, and backing up the stories with historical facts, without being mundane; however, she seemed to stray to side topics and then get stuck in a rut. The story loses momentum, and these women were very interesting, there should have been more photographs!"
4,Good,This book is very interesting. I love that it does not read like a history book. I have a hard time reading non-fiction but this book reads like a story. I recommend this book to anyone. Not even just the history buffs.
3,Susan B. Anthony,"How dare this author for accusing Susan B. Anthony of being a lesbian!Wear did she get her information?I have Lynn Sherr's book, ""Failer is Imposiable, ""and no wear did I find this accusation. As part of the Anthony family, I resent Jean Baker, as I have done Anthony genealogy for over 10 years, and have never found anything about Susan B. Anthony being a lesbian!"
5,Handbook for understanding teens.,"What insights it gives into the temptations our kids face daily. It has helped me understand the teens I attempt to help at the nearby Juvenile Detention Center and prepared me to answer their crazy arguments, like, ""There's nothing wrong with Pot; God made it!"""
4,Bluetooth Motorola HS820,"THis bluetooth works very well, I used to have one years ago and the battery died but could not find a way to replace battery. Tried a newer Motorola H700 and other brands too but found most people complained that I sounded muffled on other end.HS820 works very well on hearing and sending, not as convient shutting off or turning on as a flip bluetooth but it has very good range > 30' and does not distort when you walk away from it. Highly recommend"
1,The WORST TOEFL Book on the Market!,"I am a professional instructor and must warn anybody who is thinking of buying this book: it is simply *horrible*! There are many mistakes in the book, the grammar is too simple and the listening section is amateurish. There are much better choices!Try the Longman book! It is 1,000 times better!"
4,this album is trippy fusion,"The first guy who wrote a review saying that McLaughlin was ""aping Hendrix"" is stupid. This album is awesome, far more harmonically elegant than Hendrix usually was. The playing is inspired and primordial. The production is good - very live, almost raw. I heard this album for the first time this week and I much prefer it to Mahavishnu Orchestra (wish I've heard for the last 15 years). I thought Mahavishnu were sometimes brilliant but generally selfindulgant wankers.Buy this album. Buy Magma's ""UDU WUDU"" album too."
3,rock disgression for j.mc laughlin,"this album has been remastered from the vinyl copy(i'm in accordance with billynorm usa)and however i think it deserve an accurate best packaging with bonus tracks ,booklet and photos .The tracks are very peculiar with jazz rock influence in some parts.I like Marbles track(it was taken and arranged by Santana for his live with Buddy Miles)and this album represent a period of transition however intersting but not fundamental in mc laughlin's discography. Very beautiful the photo cover."
2,QUESTIONABLE REMASTERING,"I bought this item on the strength of the REMASTERING claim, only to discover that a vinyl edition of the recording was used - and it shows. At various points, analogue hiss can be discerned and even a crackle or two. This re-release does the magnificent original recording a disservice. It is time this fusion classic was given the state-of-the-art remake it deserves. Plus, there must also be a number of unreleased tracks still lying in Douglas Records` vaults. However, once again, the music industry is asleep at the wheel..."
3,"NOT aping Hendrix, NOT remastered","McLaughlin could have easily ""aped"" Hendrix, but he never did. Even though Buddy Miles (who stank up every session he ever played on) plays on it, I love this album, but not this version of it. This CD was ""remastered"" from a vinyl copy & for that reason alone, I would say avoid it if you can. If you can't, ""any port in a storm."""
5,Great RAID controller!,"I've got the ADST114 RAID controller hooked up to 4 SATA drives on my home server, and have had no problems at all; everything works just as it should. Installation was a breeze. Note if you are using new drives most likely you'll need to format them. You can do this by going to start and hitting run, then typing in ""%SystemRoot%\system32\compmgmt.msc /s"", clicking storage, then diskmanagement. Quality RAID controller."
5,Great Product,I now own 3 of these. Two in one computer and one in the other. These have allowed me to use SATA hard drives. The support from the manufacturer was great.
2,SLOW...,"I wanted to make file server so I bought Dell computer and 2 x 1.5GB hard disks and this RAID controller. Vista home premium was installed on Dell and I put this card and connected 2 hard disks as RAID 0 (mirror). It worked. But after installation, I tested the copy speed. It looked strange. It takes to long to copy the files. I changed several settings but it was still slow and about an hour later Vista reported that one of the disk is failing. At that time I found that Dell has RAID 0 function on board. I took out this controller and connected 2 disks to the mother board and set as RAID 0 (it only supports raid 0 - mirror). It works great. Much faster than this controller. In the future I may need another RAID controller to connect more disks because on board sata ports are full now. But I won't choose this one."
4,"Good - but definitely ""geeky""","If you are an experienced video person, this book is for you. It does a good job of explaining the difference between all of the different digital video standards. It's helpful if you have experience with analog video before reading this book.Be advised that it's definitely NOT a dummies book. It's very academic. You have to read through things a couple of times to get them to click. If you've just started in the world of digital video, you need to find another book.The best thing about this book is that all of your standards definitions are all together in one place. Wondering what the encoding format is for NTSC HDTV DVCam? It's in there."
5,Going Back 43 Years,"After looking at all 5 seasons, I concluded Season II wasthe best. From this Part II, Barrage, The Pillbox, The Eyesof the Hunter, Counter-Punch, Weep No More, Rescue, andCommand all made my personal top 50. 8 more from part Imade my top 50, have separate review for that."
2,READ ME,"These by far give the best for the money ,but no head adjustment so your eyes have to fit this perfect or you will send it back like i did...my eyes or to wide apart."
1,Warning! Coding/Authoring/Manufactoring Error On Get It Together,"This is more of a heads up warning for folks. There is some kind of coding/authoring error on this disc.The song Get It Together is flawed. For some reason, right into the first chorus the are a couple of really obvious jumps and skips. These are not the result of scratches to the disc itself. This error is in the digital transfer or authoring of the disc itself. In fact, the sample of the song Get It Together that you can listen to right on this page plays the exact spot where the error occurs. I double checked my disc on three different CD players and the same thing happened on all three players. I also checked my Soulsation 25th Anniversary set and the song Get It Together on that set doesn't have the same problem that this disc has.So, buyer beware. The disc is flawed and you are not getting the entire song Get It Together. Listen to the sample on this page and you'll hear what I mean."
4,J5 begins really to dance!,"Good CD, Skywriter, Halluluyah Day, Get It Together and Dancing Machine are the most famous tracks."
5,Enjoyable Great Album for MJJ Fans and The J5 Fans,"This album has many great songs togetherwith great music.It`s about funky,disco and soul sounds created for dancing.From this Jackson Five album,even though many of them were not Number One Songhits but they sounds absolutely so good,so vivid and yet so fresh even until today.This album is a rarity album for Michael Jackson`s fans and admirers when Michael was neither a child nor an adult but an inbetween singing with his brothers.Michael`s voice has changed a little but his vocal quality was still there as good as before.You can hear clearly that everybody in The Jackson Five gave all they had in each part of their work altogether so beautifully harmony sound that it became one of the Great Albums.It worths money ordering for Michael Jackson Collection and The Jackson Five Collection and I heartly recommend Skywriter / Get it together Album"
3,"Five stars for Get It Together, one for Skywriter","Bubblegum J5 songs were good when they were released, but not 30 years later. Adding that Skywriter was the worst (and luckily last) of J5 albums from that era, it is easy to hate this album right now.But the following J5 release was a major change in the acoustic side. They started to do funk, and the result was quite good!It's a pity G.I.T. hasn't been packed together with Moving Violation."
2,A Bubblegum Music Fan,"Although I do love the SkyWriter album alot more than Get It Together,I wish that instead of putting the Get It Together album with SkyWriter that it had been SkyWriter and the Maybe Tomorrow albums.To me the Get It Together album is the weakest album of all of The Jackson 5 albums,and a change and a departure from their Bubblegum style,which is why I liked them for to begin with.That is why I was disappointed when they could have put two of their most Bubblegum albums of all,together on one CD instead of putting the Get It Together album which pales in comparison to both of those albums by far.It was a big disappointment,at least to me it was for someone that is a huge collector of Bubblegum Music and The Jackson 5."
5,Love the container,"Wife and I in Paris two years ago, walked into drug store asked for authentic parisian cologne with citrus aroma. They sold us Mugler. I love the light clean scent and most of all the bottle with a splash top and alternative spray tube in the box."
3,Good stuff but not too happy about Sucralose,"Spend some time on Amazon reading reviews and finally settled on this one.Taste is good except for the ""fake sugar"" after taste.Everybody that has accidentally taken a sip of Diet Coke knows exactly what I mean.It has the same aftertaste as all of the other artificial sweeteners.Should have read the ingredient list better.Sucralose is the same as Splenda.Google Splenda and you'll find out why I don't want it.I'll finish the jar and not buy it again.Shame really,one of the few Whey Proteins that doesn't give me excessive flatulence in the gym."
2,Scarne Knows Poker -- NOT Writing Books,"The content of this book is very informative and helpful. It focuses on specific rules of many poker variations and some statistics to go with them. There is no shortage of calculated odds tables in this book for you to try to memorize. However, John Scarne needs to get his money at the poker tables because his writing struggles. You will not be fond of this man after your first 15 minutes of reading. To get through this book, you must have alot of determination; you will not be reading it for fun. Perhaps the toughest, most boring read of my life. In my opinion, any improvement on your poker game is not worth the pain of reading this book. There are other great books that will teach you far more efficiently."
2,News to Me,"I have to begin by admitting that I did not read this book in its entirety. I was startled, however, to learn that John Scarne invented the game of poker! I was going to read works by several authors and compare them, but since Mr. Scarne invented the game of poker along with many other popular pastimes including craps, keno, bacarrat and breathing air, I think I'll take another run at his book."
3,Somewhat useful,"The information in this book is useful only to those who are clueless of SQL. Most of the insights are rudimentary and its ""best practices"" are common sense to most experienced SQL DBAs. If you are an experienced SQL DBA, I would recommend this book for only two reasons:1)You want to obtain some stored procedures as a DBA utility. If you are already a good T-SQL programmer, this will bring you limited value.2)You want to have a good understanding of SQL Clustering and Log shipping. The book does better job than most in describing both SQL clustering and Log shipping. But the explanation is very general and more architectural than explaining how to implement and manage one."
1,Not a good choice for practical information.,"Nooooooooooooo, this is not what I'm expecting from a Resource Kit Book. This is a purely conceptual, theoretical book, not necessarily about SQL Server 2000 and don't fit in Deployment or Support & Maintenance category. Instead it fits very well in Strategy & Planning or Evaluation category. This type of information is general to enterprise databases, not only SQL Server 2000."
4,Great coverage of SQL Server Data Warehousing topics,I bought this book after searching for a good practical and design guide to the new data warehousing tools in SQL Server 2000. While not perfect none of the other tomes that I own on SQL Server do justice to this topic which is very hot in database circles these days.
1,great idea... but,"but it doesn't work for the single deluxe medela pump which i have.i bought this adaptor so i could pump in my car on my lunch break but apparently the power is too much for the motor on the single deluxe.unfortunately, the product details do not advise that this only works on the in style pump or else i wouldn't have bought iti wish they would make one for their other pumps and i'd be glad to use it."
1,Not for use with DoubleEase pump & carry All,"Just wanted people to know - I purchased the DoubleEase Breastpump & carry all. The site told me that other consumers who purchased this pump also bought the Vehicle Lighter Adaptor. What a GREAT idea! However, you should NOT use the adaptor with the DoubleEase Breast pump. They advise you right on the box. Do not waste your time and money!"
1,If only it worked consistently,Would be a great product but barely worked. Had to mess with it for a while and then it would but would still shut off. I contacted medela and they offered to replace. I think I'll take them up on that.
5,Time Saver,Married mom of a 3 yrs old boy and infant boy. This product allows me to pump on the go so that none of my boys are neglected of my time with them.
5,It makes my life much easier!!!,"Before I found out this adapter, I couldnt leave my house more than a few hours. I often need to rush home to do the pumping. Now I can pump in the car wherever I go. Very convenience. Itis a life saver! It works as good as the regular plug, I dont feel stronger and weaker. I never drive and pump, I often park the car in the quiet parking lot or I pump when my husband is driving. It is a MUST HAVE for me!"
2,Great...if it works.,This adaptor made the medela pump work even stronger than when plugged into the wall. Unfortunately it stopped working after 3 weeks or so.
5,I have had this adapter for 6 years now!,"What a life saver. I work full time and this is a huge time saver. I don't have to stay longer at work anymore, I can just pump on the way home. I have used it with all three of my kids. I do not notice, as other writers have written, a change in suction with the car adapter vs using it at home with the AC adapter. I have used this in three different makes and models of cars varying in years with no change in suction. A must have!"
1,Does not work on Subaru Tribeca,"I tried to plug in to my 08 Subaru Tribeca, It was very hard to push in and pull out. i didnt even attempt to start in. Afraid I would cause a short in my new car. if anyone has any other suggestions. Help. I have athe old Pump and style backpak."
1,Only for Medela Pump In Style,"I didn't get a chance to use it. It's not stated in the description, but you can only use this for the Medela Pump In Style."
2,must have for nursing moms,My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year. I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day. I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it. SO I would go in my car and do it. All I had a first was the battery pack. I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again. We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA. My husband would drive and I would pump. It is great..
4,Glad I added this to my pump purchase,"I will admit I haven't yet used the vehicle lighter adapter for my Pump in Style; I'm still on maternity leave and haven't had a need for it. I do spend a fair amount of time in the car for work, so I thought it would come in handy.I'm glad I bought it. A friend of mine with the same pump and who is in the car a lot for work too used hers quite a bit and was very pleased with it. Based on her rave reviews I would give it 5 stars, but since I haven't experienced it myself yet, I only gave it 4."
4,Get the right volt adapter (12 or 9 volt),"BE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT VOLTAGE ADAPTER! There are TWO different Medela vehicle car adapters. One is designed for 12 volt pumps and the other for 9 volt pumps. If you use the 9 volt adapter on a 12 volt pump, the suction will be weaker and/or a different pace than what you are used to using the regular AC plug adapter. Mismatching pumps and adapters will, over time, stress your breastpump motor and/or your car battery.Read the product information and examine the labeling on your pump to be sure what kind you have."
3,Convenient but tricky,"It is important to realize that the car adaptor works differently than the AC adaptor. I use my Pump in Style on the highest settings and found that with the car adaptor it was now pumping very fast and shallow. I assume I could get used to that. The big problem that I had was that the quick short pumps drew milk up the tubing several times. What a mess to clean out all that back flow! Lowering the speed did not help it pump more deeply. I ended up pumping very slowly for it to work.All in all, this product was worth it for long trips- I have time and lots of baby wipes on hand. If you are planning to use this product daily (on the way home from work or on your lunch break) you may want to reconsider."
5,For older Medela pumps,"Older Medela pumps need the 12 V lighter, which is frequently not sold at Babies R Us. Do not be confused and get the wrong size of volts. I think the cut off is 2007. You might want to double check that though."
5,road trip helper,This is so much better than running on 20 AA batteries!!! I had been struggling with the pump slowing down and not working as well because the batteries died all the time and this fixed everything. We went for a road trip (6 hours) and I didn't have to worry about my pump working. I just wish I thought of ordering it sooner.
5,Great item for mom on the go,I can't imagine my life without this! Works great. Working mother of 4 That needs to pump between drop offs and pick ups and to or from work. This is a must have
1,Cost me $300,I used this with my medela Pisa from 2005 and it burned up the motor! Had to buy a whole new pump
4,Worked well for a while,"I purchased one of these when I was nursing my first child, and I used it twice a day, 3x/week for nine months. Now, with my second, the adapter up and died. I'm about to replace it with another, but I got pretty good use out of the first.Lots of people like how long the cord is. I think it's almost too long, considering I pumped as I drove (don't ask). It just ended up getting tangled up in my feet and on the passenger seat next to my cell phone charger!"
2,"Paslode, not what it use to be","I bought this tool to replace my old Paslode finish nailer. I was first skeptical about the magazine and housing being all plastic and almost bought another brand that still used aluminium. It has held up, but the tool is taller than the old one and does not seem to have enough power. I have also had several driver blades break in only three months. I will put this one on the shelf and either look for a used old Paslode model or switch brands completely."
2,a review of Modern Physics by Hans C. OHanian,"This book is certainly not one that simply assumes a knowledge of classical physics. The text assumes (at the very least) an introductory knowledge of modern physics, as it quite liberally employs terms and concepts unbeknownst to most classical-physics entrepreneurs. As i consider myself to be one of these, this book, prior to my professor's lectures, was utterly useless. While the material contained in any modern physics text may be somewhat convoluded, this one in particular does the amateur classical physicist no service. However, a previously-accredited modern physicist can almost certainly gain a thorough review of many generalized modern physics concepts via this book."
3,POOR PACKAGE!!!!!!!,"Beauty Glasses but i bought 12 and 7 arrived broken very, very, very bad package!!!"
3,"Nice book for a read or two, but pretty boring after a couple reads.","Book contains two stories based on the characters of Snow White and Cinderella. It's a light, easy read but I find the stories to be a bit inane due to basic writing and lack of interesting storyline. I much prefer another book that we recently got:Happily Ever After Stories (Disney Storybook Collections)It's a heavy hardback/compilation, not a paperback like this one, but the stories I find to be of much higher quality, not to mention all of the other nice qualities of this book (see my 5-star review)."
5,Beauties in Bloom is a Beautiful Book,"My 2-year old daughter loves this book. After reading both stories, she then says, ""Again, Mommy"". A definite collection of short stories to have."
4,American Angels: Baptism of Blood,"If you are a fan of female wrestling at all, this movie is a must see. However, if you are looking for something that is realistic or even semi-documentary in nature, you will be disappointed. This movie is more of a thinly veiled excuse to have beautiful, half-naked women in close physical contact with each other. It is more of an erotic or sensual film than it is sport related, although it is not in any way pornographic."
3,"So-so movie, even for women's wrestling fans","When you compare this movie to the benchmark of all women's wrestling movies ""All the Marbles"" this movie barely rates. The match choreography is fair-to-poor and the storyline mediocre. The women in it are attractive and it does have a couple of matches in it, so I had to give it ***. (...)"
3,"Bodies, Bodies, Bodies","If you want to see scantily clad women, this movie is for you. I was looking for something more about women in sports so this was not the video for me. If you want real athletic action and stunning women too, see SHADOW BOXERS the great documentary film about the worlds best , and most attractive, female boxer - the very awesome Lucia Rijker."
5,A Must Buy!!!,"I bought this DVD collection a few weeks ago and wish I would have done so sooner! I first heard about it from a tuba playing friend of mine that got it for Christmas and enthusiastically recommended it to me.If you're a fan of Solti or the Chicago Symphony Orchestra this is a MUST for your collection! Most of the footage is of Solti and the CSO (a plus for me). Great shots of former CSO Principal Trumpet Adolph ""Bud"" Herseth and the rest of the brass section. If I'd have to pick a highlight, it would be Bruckner 6&7, although there isn't a minute I don't enjoy!Buy it today!...or at least add it to your wish list;)"
5,MB,"A very comprehensive collection of CSO broadcasts over the past many years. I believe some of these were recorded back in the 70s, so the video quality will vary accordingly. The fourth disc with the Vienna Philharmonic was recorded in the mid 90's, includes some rehearsal sessions, and is especially nice. In all, this is a very well put together set and was well worth the money for me."
3,Just okay,"Taste is fair. I went through the box, but haven't ordered more. I decided to get extra fiber from other sources."
1,Too difficult for kids to shift,"These shifters came on my daughters trek bike and she cannot shift back down because its too difficult to turn. grip shifts should not be used on kids bikes, or any bikes for that matter. they should just stop making them and only make the trigger shifters, it would be cheaper in the long run to only make the quality ones."
1,Addresses-Fell short of Expectations,I was looking for a nice address book to give as a gift as a housewarming present and when i saw it I noticed what a waste of money it was. It cost much more than other address books. The cover is decorative but don't let it fool you.. Don't buy this book!
5,best yet,"this is david's third solo album and represents his best work yet -david wraps his keen lyrics about time and faith and hope with a terrific array of sounds: from solo acoustic to bluegrass to jazzy pop to slightly classical,"
1,HORRID ELECTRONIC SOUNDS SCARE MY 1 YR. OLD,"My well-meaning and dog-loving mother gave this to my son for his first Christmas. My usually very bubbly, curious, and non-nervous baby burst into tears the second the toy made noise! He has other toys which are motion sensitive and which make equally obnoxious sounds, but this one STILL scares him 3 months later. (For awhile I hid it in the bottom of the toy chest, but just walking throught the room would set it off & set the baby crying...) Now I have it on top of a low dresser where my son can reach it if he's interested. He reached for it last week, and burst into tears as soon as it made its ZOOOM noise. I personally don't like electronic toys but was willing to love this if my child did -- but this one makes truly horrid LOUD sounds which apparently push my son's buttons..."
4,forgotten classic,"This is one of those classic records that's often sorely overlooked due to the shadow cast by similarly great records by the artist (in this case it's Wyatt's ""Rock Bottom"" - certainly an essential purchase in itself). Prior to Wyatt's ""comeback"" in experimental-rock circles in the mid-'90s this was often dismissed as a self-indulgent mess best left on the record company's deletion list... what rot! This is pure inspired experimentalism on a plate, a fantastic mix of free jazz, vocalese, musique concret and psychedelia. Very much in the same league as similar artists of the time - Tim Buckley, Can and Miles Davis - ""End of An Ear"" creates a seamless blend of many disparate styles, creating a new genre of its own where rock, avant-garde and jazz meet as one. Comparable in parts to Can's ""Tago Mago"", Buckley's ""Starsailor"" or electric/psych-period Miles, this criminally ignored piece of work in the Wyatt puzzle deserves some serious re-evaluation in the rock-crit circles."
4,A Step Beyond Soft Machine,"Robert Wyatt's first solo album can best be described as a Very free jazz continuation of the Soft Machine's album THIRD. Whereas the tunes on THIRD had melodies and a certain sense of cohesion , there is none of that here. If you're not into experimental jazz (and this IS good stuff), this is not the place to begin your Robert Wyatt collection."
3,Unspectacular with exceptions,"Book-ended by the only two stellar vocal-driven tracks, the majority of this masturbatory attempt at psychedelic free jazz falls flat for lacking a melodic glue and plays instead like Kraut-rock throwaway tracks. Still, ideas abound, some even revolutionary in production I'm sure, plus the actual merit from those two actually developed sonic experiments which obviously were strategically placed to distract from a more hollow center."
5,Beautiful Poetry,"I was stunned by the beauty of your book, and having read Norman Corwin's review, I can only echo his aptly-put assessment. Thank you so much."
4,hi def nostalgia,"a long time favorite and key film from my youth based on a story by a key writer from my youth. transfer is great, could be better but won't complain. just glad it's made it to blu!"
5,Buy it,best movie there is its my personal favorite and i beleive that everyopne should watch it and im just a huge fan so i got the delux version
2,"Confortable, Cool looking, But with a serious catch","Ok nice looking shoe. Big wide toe box, good sole, comfortable fit with no real break in required.So whats not to like? A: Build Quality.It sucks. the insides of htis shoe are ripping out after 2-3 months of wear.For the price, I expect a better made shoe. Several friends of mine had similar experiences with their Keens, my recommendation: stay away until they improve their durability.-D"
5,G money ! !!!!,I only have one word to describe these swords -MANNNN! I just recived these swords in yesterday and they really have me excited . Now i think everyone over here wants some of there own . Even though the paint chipped in some areas of the of it it's stil was and is a great set to own . Now only need to find a ninja outfit and i am good .lol
5,Inspiring Movie,The Motorcycle Diaries in my opinion is probally one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is very inspiring and shows how Ernesto Guevara becomes Che Guevara. I think everyone should read the actual book and see the movie. Seeing and hearing about the injustice in the world will open your eyes and make you want to do something about it. I was a sociology major to begin with but Che has inspired me to persue Social Theory more and want to be a human rights activist. He was right and is still right. There is so much injustice in this world.
3,Motorcycle Diaries,The MotorCycle Diaries was a hard movie to understand because of the language. I did not liked how we had to read the sub titles. The best part that i liked was were they kept falling in the motorcycle.
4,Motorcycle Daries,"This movie was outrages because it shows a young boy named Ernesto who has a dream of becoming a medical doctor. He went to Amazon jungle to help the people out with leoprasy. In the end he ended up changing people's lives. Later on Ernesto was caught by the CIA and was later murdered, so that he wouldn't be able to control people and have alot of power."
3,Okay,"This DVD was okay it was not that great, but it was okay to watch as a movie to learn about El Che. I didn't reallly like the part whenever you had to read the caption because they tlaked to fast for you to understand what they were saying."
3,The Motor cycle Diaries,The thoughts that i had of the movie were that it confused me since I couldn't see anything that was visual. But from hearing the movie it seemed like it had some comedy and that they had nice long adventures. I think they had fun with eachother and that they were determine to help people for any reason they had. It was a great movie though.
5,The Motorcycle Diaries,"ased on Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara's memoirs about his eye-opening trip and political awakening, Salles's lushly photographed ""Diaries"" is an impressively acted and superbly directed coming-of-age story. As the journey begins in Buenos Aires, we meet two bon vivants from prosperous families who wish to see the world before embarking on a career. Ultimately, they encounter South America's impoverished Indian communities, and spend an entire year ministering to the ailing denizens of a leper colony. Anchored by Bernal and De La Serna's hearty performances, ""Diaries"" is a rousing portrait of political integrity and humanitarian commitment."
4,Very intriguing movie!,"This is a great movie with an interesting perspective. When most people think of Ché Guavara, they rarely think of his life before his involvement with Cuba. A bit elaborated, but makes for a great movie experience."
4,The Motorcycle Diaries,"This movie is very inspiring.I was motivated by Ernesto's determination to help the lepers.He showed them that they are not just outcasts.He made the people feel loved and cared for and he not only fought for them, he also fought against all injustice."
5,The early 'Che' ...,"Long before teaming up with Fidel and overthrowing the corrupt Batista regime, and long before becoming not only a world famous revolutionary but also immortal icon, a very young Ernesto Guevara went on a very long motorcycle ride with his good friend, and learned a lot about life.This excellent film moves right along at a good pace, has brilliant cinematography (they even show the two at Machu Pichu) and tells a wonderful tale. The motorcycle (a 500 Norton single cylinder) dies about half-way through the story, but Ernesto and his friend continue their journey. While his friend is busy chasing latin skirts (!) the future 'Che' is busy putting it all in perspective and building his own unique world view.All in all a beautiful tale of 'two lives who ran parallel for awhile'. Highly recommended on it's own terms, and also for those who are looking for early Che's life story."
3,The Motorcycle Diaries,This movie is just like the book. I haven't finished reading the book yet but the movie seems like it is going to be just like the book. I didn't like the movie very much because it is all in Spanish and I had to read the subtitles the whole movie so I really didn't like that. We also watch it at school so I really couldn't understand what was happening but in the begining I understood it because I read about it an dwe discussed it in class. It was a good movie.
3,it was ok,motorcycle diaries was ok i did not under staned what thay were saying. the sudtitels helped a lot the one thing that i did not like adout the movie was that the whole movie was in spanish
5,Che,The movie was good. The movie moved me because of what Che did as a revoultionary. It amazes me that one person can change things in the world.
2,"Politics aside, a decent film","I watched this movie specifically for it's cinematography. South America is a beautiful, exotic, and diverse continental rich in history and culture. Having traveled there several times I find the land fascinating.However.......It amazes me how today's liberals, who adhere to an ideology supposedly based on tolerance and pacifism, actually admire Che Guevara. The film glossed over the fact that he was a bigot at times and a murderous thug, having participated in the execution of untold numbers of political enemies. Young people today who sport ""Che"" merchandise are totally ignorant of the real historybehind this man."
3,Mild road-movie,"A Hollywood film co-produced by several countries, where the director of ""Central Station"" can show parts of South America for First World consumption. The question is: how you would have filmed it? (If not as a tourist travelogue). The thing is that makes Ernesto Guevara a bones and flesh man (or boy), but could had used a little bit of film magic to foreshadow without bold statements the great man that Ernesto is on the brink to become. Maybe too episodic for his own good, but all road movies have that structure. Better if you speak Spanish, and great if you are Argentinean (to feel again that is the best country of Latin America)."
4,Motorcycle Dairies,"This movie was really good. At first I thought it was going to be very boring, but it wasn't. It changed my perspective about alot of things like: money, different people, and different points of view. You should watch this movie and see if it changes or atleast affects your life a bit. Watch it and you'll see."
3,Motorcycle Diaries,I really enjoyed this movie. It was really interesting. I liked it because I saw how Ernesto and Alberto went through life.
4,Thought provoking,Thought provoking examination of the conditions in which many humans live. Picturesque. Well done movie. I particularly enjoyed the end.
1,Disgraceful,"As the grandson of a farmer who was made to dig his own grave and then was shot in the back of the head at Che's command, I find this canonization of Che to be an utter disgrace. Thank God my parents and I made it to America where I can be free, I can have access to the internet, and I can speak without fear. I only wish my dead grandfather, my dead uncle, my dead aunt, and my imprisoned and tortured cousins could have been afforded the same basic human dignity."
3,glimpses of a journey,"this is not a typical movie which revolves around a plot,then reaches the climax and the end credits roll-on,and you come home feeling entertained.No...this is not such a movie.this is a film about a meaningful events of a man who later became a REAL hero.its full of fun events in the beginning of the film,later slowly transforming in to something very intense and meaningful.ofcourse the music is of great quality and the picturesque landscapes are stunning.but this film is more on the documentry side...so be prepared,if you gonna watch this"
3,Oustanding and totally realistic portrayal of a compassionate hero on the same level as Ghandi.,"I thought this was a beautiful film. The great actor, director, and deep thinker Robert Redford really did an outstanding job of realistically portraying South America in the 1950s and telling the story of Che, the great humanitarian who now adornes so many T-Shirts. I thought the best part of the film was the scene at La Cabaña prison in which Che presided over the executions of over 500 political prisoners, including children. It was such an act of heroic compassion on his part because he was able to rid the world of so many vile, contemptable capitalists in such a short period of time. I can see now why so many people like and admire Che and bear his image on their T-shirts. Well done, Robert Redford. ""Tengo una remera del Che y no sé por qué."""
2,The Life of Saint Che,"This film is the cinematic equivalent of a ""Che"" t-shirt: a sanitary and simplified image of a complex man, custom-made to appeal to college kids. Some see Che as a hero and others see him as a monster. I see him as neither - I went to this film hoping to get a look at the human side of the young Che, so that I can better understand why he did the things that he did later in life. Instead, I was treated to a shallow hagiography which (as one reviewer so humorously put it) made Che look like Mother Teresa. We might as well call this film ""The Communist Gospel According to Saint Che."" Go read a few books to learn more about the real Che and leave this film to the t-shirt wearing college kids."
3,Hard to See but quite alright,The movie was like I said hard to see when my 9th grade watched it yesterday. I did see some parts and they where quite funny even if it was in Spanish and I speak English.
3,motercycle diaries,The movie was good overall. The movie had funny parts and some strong language. It had moments when you got confused but overall it was straight forward.
3,MD,"motorcycle diaries was intresting.i thought the story or plot was great. it was little aggervating when you have to read subtiles, when they were going really fast. butj overall the movei was good!!!!"
4,The legend,"The movie portrays the journey of Erensto and Che as they set out for an awsome adventure. It has love, action, and comedy in this cuban film. Even though you have to read the subtitles in English, you can still understand it"
3,OK !!!! but it could be better,"ok, could be better in actions and more scence of Che going against the government."
5,Motorcycle Diaries,Well done and interesting film offering accurate background on the subject: Che. A favorite of my students.
2,Que pasa con los subtitulos?,"That's right. What's with NOT being able to turn off the English subtitles, despite the option to do so. Ridiculous. The movie 'Traffic' affords this option, so it CAN be done."
4,"Excellent movie, dissapointed with subtitles","The movie is excellent and I don't feel the need to say anything more about the plot or cinematic features than what has already been said.I gave the movie four stars because I bought the DVD hoping to be able to take in the movie in Spanish without the English subtitles. I was very dissapointed that one can't disable the English subtitles--rather, they are permanently superimposed over the film. Personally, I find them to be distracting. For others hoping to do the same, be sure to find a DVD that is formatted without the English subtitles (if such exists)."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I don't see how this movie could possibly merit five stars. The first half is your typical ""buddy film"" with the cinematography stealing the show. There's not much substance here, but it's nice to look at and the actors provide some comedic moments. Unfortunately, the second half quickly degenerates into a preachy and embarrassing piece of communist propaganda. Except for the cinematography and an occasional laugh, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Oh well... I guess that's two hours and eight dollars that I will never see again."
5,sensational,Motorcycle Diaries is a emotional and inspiring movie to watch. This should be on your movie priority list because of the messages. It will also create emotional reactions at some point. Morotcycle Diaries will leave you thinking towards the end wanting to know more about the truth behind the entire movie.
5,Motorcycle Diaries,"This movie is about 2 friends and their adventure, they travel across South America. Motorcyle Diaries showed me and made me realise that there are people out in the world who are cruel and unfair..but not all of them. Ernesto ""Fuser"" is a medical student and this is his journey along with his friend Alberto. As they travel they find out that people of the lower class and others below that are treated as animals..I loved this movie, and I really reccomend for you watching it."
4,Hmm...,This movie made me think about many things. I now want to learn and explore more about Che Guevera and the things that he accomplished. There were so many scenes that showed the beautiful features of South America. They also showed the realities of many peoples lives. They also show how badly people were being mistreated.
5,Great Travel Movie!,"I love this movie, especially since I've done a lot of traveling abroad recently. If you're the type of person who loves to travel or is dreaming of traveling, this movie will put you in a wonderful mood. Of course it's in Spanish and the subtitles are in English, but after watching for a few minutes you forget all about that. You'll enjoy the beautiful scenery, the wonderful movie soundtrack, and of course the moving story. Plus the lead actor (Gael Garcia Brenal) is very attractive! The tale is about the youthful adventures of Che Guevara. You see him being affected by his trip through South America which helps him tranform into a revolutionary figure eventually."
2,OK....,"First of all, I have no compliants about the acting or who this person really was. I didn't know about this guy before I watched the movie. I think the movie is somewhat over-romantized. It's supposed to be a story about how this journey had changed the main characters. But, the movie tried to put too many incidents together like I haven't developed enough ""feeling"" for the situation, and they had moved on to any place. Almost towards the end, the way the movie portrayed how he swam across the river just to celebrate his birthday with those patients suffering from leprosy, is a bit .... hollywood heroic style. In short, if I want to know more about Latin America's history, I think it's better to watch a documentary film. The movie is neither informative nor very entertaining (to my taste). But, if you're someone who like ""artistic"" movie, this may be for you."
1,strange propaganda movie.....,"Yes, I watched movie. And then I realized movie is based on main character letters and in reality we had two main characters. Why we see movie from point of view of Che and not second guy? The reality was same for both why the evaluation and reaction was different?It is especially funny to see results 50 years later when violent struggle and revolution resulted in creation of concentration camp called Cuba.And now people risk their life just to get out of communistic paradise--is this Che vision? Or results always independent from our intentions?"
1,Becareful --- Communist Propoganda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dumb me!!!I should read more reviews before I purchsing the movie.I though this is a movie about touring the beautiful South America with motorcycles. I did not even know who they portry in the movie. Then I found out when I was watching half way of the movie,I suddenly felt I saw this movie before! Ha, It is a communist propoganda! Somebody must learnt from either USSR or Chinese communist propogada machines to fool inocent people to believe those mass murderers are poor people's heros. I lived in Communist country for many years and this is exactly how they portry the dictators as heros who care about poor people. There are plenty of such movies in USSR and China to portry the dictators sush as Stalin and Mao in the exact format. Do not fooled by the movie.I gave it a one star because I can not gave it zero or negative.The beautiful scenes of the beautiful South America and the mass murderers can't be mixed together."
4,"Good, but misleading","Just a short and sweet review here.The movie is very good and exhibits the passion of a young Che Guevara, but it makes the mistake of assuming that being around the poor people in society automatically makes you a socialist.That just isn't the case."
1,The Motorcycle Diaries,Ithink that the DVD was kind of boring even though it was a type of good learning of El Che you still had to understand a lot of parts of the movie which I really didn't understand that is why I gave this DVD a 1 star.
5,Motorcycle Diaries,"I enjoyed watching this DVD. It showed so many new things that I've never seen. Like the mountains,the bodies of water,and the animals. It reminded me of when I went to Bolivia this summer. It was Amazing."
3,LIke it or not,This shows how a regular student training to be a doctor and becomes a revolutionary leader. Its story of two people that ride an old bike and head on to face the road by themselves. And and it shows how Ernesto( Che) grows towards being a revolutionary and helping out Cuba.
3,"Beautiful scenery and good acting, yet a disappointment","I was excited to finally see this movie after hearing a lot of positive reviews of it. The film has some stunning images of South America and Gael Garcia Bernal does a fine job in the role of Che, but I was expecting more from this film. It was my understanding that the journey across South America played a crucial role in Che's later transformation to a revolutionary, but I felt that this wasn't easily apparent for the majority of the film. Perhaps it was just too introspective or subtle for my tastes. I'd recommend Bernal's Y Tu Mama Tambien instead, as it's another road movie with wonderful visuals but I feel it also has more thought provoking political moments."
5,Best Movie to come out in years,"I saw this at a little art-film theater in January and was absolutely mesmerized by it. For all that you hear about Che's years as a great Cuban revolutionary, I really knew woefully little about what had driven him to become such an influential man.What starts as a feel-good buddies on the road together story slowly transitions into a deep film about the human condition, as Che's perspective on the world deepens and matures. You go from laughing at the traveling companions methods of getting free meals and continually falling off of the overpacked motorcycle, to being touched by how caring and courageous Che's behavior among the unemployed incan laborers and the residents of the leper colony.This is a fabulous movie, with all the dynamics and timeless messages of a true classic."
3,Not Too Insightful Look At Che Guevara,"The Motorcycle Diaries is an unusual biographical movie in that no real attempt is made to gain insight into the main character. Why did Che Guevara go from being a young doctor into becoming a human killing machine? While members of the medical profession did periodically join revolutionary units, it was almost always as soldiers serving in a medical role. Medical student Guevara was unusual in that he became a leader instead of remaining a medic.Basically, The Motorcycle Diaries does not present a whole picture of Che Guevara's growth. It is mainly a nice exhibition of countryside cinematography. Its something of a buddies on the road picture. It offers little insight into Guevara or why he would abandon medicine for killing people in the name of Marxist revolution.Basically, The Motorcycle Diaries is just cotton candy for the mind. Watch it for fluff and simple relaxation only."
4,hasta la victoria siempre!,"this spanish language film accounts the early life of che guevara, and his tour thru south america while on vacation from medical school in argentina in the early 1950s. whatever one thinks of che, one cannot dispute the charisma. and gael garcia bernal (who is dreamy creamy, btw) evokes that on screen. the sequence in the leper colony can not help but get to you. and if the movie is a trifle overlong, im not sure what i would have omitted. worth anyones time."
1,CRUEL MOVIE,TRULY A CRUEL FILM FOR THOSE THAT LIVED AND DIED AT THE HANDS OF THIS MURDERER CALLED che
1,"Awesome Movie, not so great DVD edition.","The movie is great, lots of reviews about it. But this edition has subtitles embedded on the movie that you CAN'T TURN OFF. Beware of that before buying it ;)"
2,The motorcycle daries,I really did not enjoy the whole movie even thouugh there were caertain parts that I really enjoyed.My personal opion was that I really don't enjoy this types of movies but the funny parts were the ones that I really enjoyed. And there were parts were the charecters really captured my intrerest by doing things that would make there parents proud. I also thought it was a good idea that he went with a friend so that he did not have to go through all of this alone. And he would have somebody to share his expierence even though he was not that good of a friend and was not a very good friend. But the sad part was that he ended dieing in the end anyway
2,Disappointing,"Here we have an example of a filmmaker who is afraid (or unable) to look past the surface experiences of a character and dig for a deeper motivation and a deeper meaning. We are presented with the historical facts of Guevara's life (albeit in an entertaining fashion) yet we can only guess at what interior conflicts led Guevara to make the choices that he did.Great filmmakers such as Tarkovsky and Cassavetes have the ability to ""humanize"" their subjects. In other words, they avoid all biases and stereotypes and take us directly into the minds and hearts of their characters in a way that helps us to understand their choices and accept them on a more personal, human level. I believe this is what Salles was attempting to do here, but he failed to do so. Perhaps he was afraid to stray too far from the iconic facade of Guevara and socialist ideology or perhaps he has simply reached the limits of his artistic ability. Either way, this film falls short of what it could have been."
3,Dragged out,"The movie, at its core, is a good movie; yet, I found it to be long and dragged out, at times. Could have been better..."
3,If you're looking for Che the revolutionary...,"Look elsewhere. The movie is an often quite boring look into a motorcycle ride Che made with a fellow ""doctor"" (neither were exactly) to see what exactly was happening in South America. It ends with the two going to a leper colony and seeing the hardships of the natives. What the movie does show is how idealistic and somewhat naive the young Che is. He is seeing that they need to do something. There is hardly any plot to the movie and hardly anything actually happens to them. The acting, though, is superb. It's not a movie that I'd want to see a second time."
1,Motorcycle Diaries,"The title is miss leading. This flik has little or nothing to do with motorcycles or anything else. I wish I had known ahead of time that it was a forign film with hard to read captions. Save your money, I tossed my copy in the trash."
2,Fallido retrato de la infancia de un revolucionario,"La película resulta bastante decepcionante porque retrata con una ingenuidad sorprendente la toma de conciencia de uno de los mas nefastos fanáticos que ha padecido latinoamerica. El personaje de Guevara resulta endeble y caricaturesco al extremo, con una carga de arrogancia insoportable.Si eres un extranjero que no conoce nada de la historia de sudamerica como y estas habituado al folklore revolucionario que existe al respecto, como la música del francés Manu Chao, tal ves la disfrutes.Lo único rescatable son la actuación del compañero de Guevara, Alberto Granado, quien aporta humor y el toque de humanidad ausente en el protagonista, junto a los bellísimos paisajes de America Latina. Pero para eso mejor es ver un documental de viajes."
5,A love letter to a pre-Che,"I've read both books that this DVD is based on, and the way they are put together makes an interesting film. If you haven't yet discovered the talents of Garcia Gael Bernal, you certainly will want to see more of his films after this. Beautifully photographed, will make you want to take a tour of Latin America yourself. Perfect casting all around. Truly gives you a better understanding of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevaro's motivation for who he was to become. The Widescreen edition is a must to appreciate the magnificent magical feeling that makes you want to get on the back of the motocycle with them."
5,"Brilliant acting, breathtaking landscapes & music, touching","This is a road movie about Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, before his ""political"" times. Actually, it is fair to say that it depicts in a romantic way the road trip through the heart of South America that opened him up to the things to come later. He embarks on a 10K+ KM journey with his buddy Alberto Granado, riding ""La Poderosa"" (The Powerful One), an oil-leaking motorcycle, going from Argentina to Venezuela, through Chile, Peru and Colombia.The performance by Gael Garcia Bernal, once more, does not dissapoint, turning him into one of the most versatile (yet controversial) actors of this generation. The music by Gustavo Santaolalla is breathtaking, becoming a perfect match for the monumental South American landscapes (think Andes, Amazon river...). The movie as a whole leaves you feeling good in the end. Highly recommendable."
5,amazing,saw this many times on tvloved itit was hilarioustouching and very powerfulI like the actingthe scenerythe direction and directingI give all of Arnold's movies a chancebecause you can't always please everyone.and he did a good job on this in my eyesit's a classic comedy/action movie and it's brilliantI got this on dvd now and will watch it again and again. it's just too memorable to forget a movie like this.
3,Meh,"After a magical ticket blasts a young boy out of his seat and into the movie he's watching, his wildest fantasies come true -- battling the bad guys with his crime fighting hero."
4,"""don't give up your day job"" says jack slater","this film is quite odd it's been brought up in a quite smart way, a young little boy goes to a cinema with a magic ticket given to him, the ticket makes the boy go to the movie with arnie, as the boy saw who murdered jack slater cousin he becomes partners with arnold , together the two help one another and together are going to get revenge, on the people who killed arnie's cousin.if you dont like the typical action well then forget about this because this is arnies biggest action film when impossible things happen like when arnies driveing with no hand and busy shooting the bad guys.if your the erson who does love his typical action films then your in he right place to buy it because your be watching it over and over until you die."
1,Last Action Zero,"This film is a seventh-rate Terminator wannabe.The acting is secord-rate & over the top mainly with Lieutenant Dekker.The action scences are quite decent at best .The celebrity cameos are pointless.Some jokes were funny but not all of them.Not to metion,the lack of realism in the film's ""real world"" segment.I give this film a 2 and a half out of 10."
5,"TWO WORDS: ""TOTAL QUALITY""","What is wrong with you people? Don't you know a quality film when you see one? I first saw this movie when I was in seventh grade, it was a great movie back then and now, six years later still is.Like the guy from the UK said, this movie was supposed to be a spoof, if you can't see that you're some kind of ding-dong. From the great begining to the hard rock and loud explosions all the way to the end credits. Jack Slater is one bad mo fo. I could go on and on about this movie."
5,Under rated Hero,"This is a GREAT, GREAT movie. Swollowed up in ""Jurassic Park"" fever in 1993, this funny ,clever send-up of hollywood and action films never got the attention due such a fantastic movie!"
5,One of my favorite!,I don't know why the critics panned this movie. It is one of my favorite movies. I can well remember those times when I was a youngster wishing that I was part of a movie. This movie fulfills this fantasy. Don't try to make any sense of it....just enjoy it!
5,Excellent film -- A must for Arnie fans,"This is one of those films that you just have to watch.Excellent humour, tons of action and fighting. What more could an Arnie fan want. Schwarzenegger is great in this film. He shows us how different the movie world is from the real world. This is something that hasn't been done before.I hope they make a sequel to this."
4,"Fun movie, blu-ray is lacking though","Hi Folks,this is a review of the BLU-RAY edition. This movie was a bit of a financial failure I believe in its release but I enjoyed it for a fun/dumb action flick!I actually have the regular DVD edition from the UK which as1)theatrical trailer2)a featurette3) music video featuring AC/DC and Arnoldall fun bonus features and NOT on the Blu-Ray?I've deducted a star for the fact that they've delivered a 'bare bones' Blu-ray and besides the ability to carry higher resolution one of the benefits of Blu-Ray is the bigger storage so there is not excuse for having elminated bonus features already produced?and the Blu-ray on this isn't substantially better than the regular edition to my eyes..I can't recommend an upgrade for the money."
2,"What if they made a comedy, and nobody laughed?","""The Last Action Hero"" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly. The action genre is certainly ripe for a mocking, what with the thousands of ""Die Hard"" clones Hollywood has thrust upon the public. This could have been the perfect spoof film- team ""Die Hard"" director John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie, the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess.Aside from a humorous bit with Arnold as Hamlet at the begining, this one is a real dog."
1,Unbelievably boring,"In my opinion, this movie has got to be Arnold's worst movie. It was so stupid and boring, I turned it off 15 minutes into the movie. I would give it NO STARS if I could! Thank goodness Schwarzenegger's other movies make up for this turkey! Definitely not worth renting let alone buying. I would pass on this one."
1,FORGET IT.,"Truculent, unispired directed movie. The original idea was good, but was wasted while developing it. THi child is annoying, not a good actor at all."
1,This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen!,I first saw this movie in the theaters and I really didn't like it. It was so corny and the plot wasn't that good. This movie is getting really annoying because it comes on TV almost everyday. I thought this movie was like a two an a half hour TV skit from Saturday Night Live.
1,the most crapiest movie ive ever seen,arnold cannot handle comedy this is what he clearly shows here after kindergarten cop. the action was just ooooooooook! I wish the guys had a half star.
4,great film,this movie was under appreciatedit's a hilarious motion picturearnold schwarzenegger played the part perfectlyit's making fun of a typical action style movie and that's what makes it so hilariousif you want to see a movie appropriate for all ages that will make you laugh over and over again get this movie!it should be part of everyones collection
3,What's wrong with making a fun movie?,"I realized something the other day. Sometimes we take movies way too seriously. Yes, the screenplay and the acting in Last Action Hero are sub-par, but who cares? The movie is a lot of fun to watch and it has a lot of good action in it. It may not be a masterpiece, but who ever said it had to be? A movie like this isn't meant to be taken seriously. I like it, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,A decent movie,"I avoided this film for the last few years because of all the horrible reviews. I finally gave in and watched it the other day and have to say, it ain't that bad. It could have been a lot better (i.e. they could have chased the bad guys through other films), but it wasn't near as bad as the critics would have you believe. Definately worth a look."
4,Underrated and unfairly-trashed comedy,"Please do not believe what you here about this movie... it's merely everyone jumping on the bandwagon. If you are an Arnold fan or even a fan of action and comedy, it is a must see. Sure it has some flaws, but that is what happens when you try to do something original. Keep an open mind... and bring your sense of humor, some intelligence, and an eye for sarcasm."
4,i bought the movie because its good,it has a ton of reallity check lines and any movie that takes place in action hero land is cool
2,The most disappointing movie of Schwarzenegger's career,"After making numerous hits, this was Arnold Schwarzenegger's streak-breaker. Great and very original plot, but VERY badly done. It tried hard to be funny where it shouldn't have. Annoying kid had too much screen time. I'm a big fan of Schwarzenegger and I was extremely disappointed with this film."
3,One of the olny PG-13 rated movies i like.,"O.K. waht does this have to do with any thing. Not a lot of story, wath is there for a movie that is about a movie with in a movie. Some good action stars like Sharon Stone, Jean-Claude Van Damme and pop up in the film here and there, but that is about it. See it if you are in a mood for a PG rated comdy/sci-fi film."
3,Not to bad!!,The movie was very stupid. It was funny at times but overall the movie could have been made on a higher level. Some little kids may like it because of the animation. Students ranging from grade 4 and up would not enjoy this film. END
1,Don't waste your money,It's sad that the average review stars is higher because it doesn't reflect all the people who didn't bother to write about this. Not to mention there isn't an option for giving it no stars. The movie is just plan bad and boring. It's the first movie where I actually felt like I was being tortured while watching it. Luckily the exit was nearby.
1,How do you get from Hunt for Red October to this?,"Last Action Hero had all the markings of being a great film. A good director, good actors (Charles Dance would be a wonderful villian). What made it fall apart was a weak story, and this would follow nearly all of Schwarzenegger's films post True Lies. To say Last Action Hero was rushed is quite an understatement considering John McTiernan did such a marvelous job depicting Bruce Willis and Sean Connery as two badass heroes in two brilliant written stories. If your a Schwarzenegger maniac go ahead and pick it up. But if your looking for that ""movie within a movie"" premise, skip this and check out Wes Craven's A New Nightmare."
1,"An unremarkable, dull action picture","Here are the ingredients for making a summer blockbuster hit: a big name star, a pretentious theatrical preview, loud action, and a PG-13 rating (hey, they want people of all ages, kids and their parents, to make it break records). But it fell flat since Ah-nold's prescense doesn't make up for a lack of plot, the action scenes were laughably substandard, and its competitor was JURASSIC PARK. Recently, I rented it as a time killer and what I got was just a total waste of time. It's so maniplutive and derivative in how it borrows elements from classic foreign cinema to the Hollywood classics of the 40's and 50's to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO to all the successful teen comedies/dramas/adventures. Even die-hard fans of Schwarzenegger will be very, very disappointed."
3,YOUR AVERAGE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER FILM,"A BOY [AUSTIN O BRIEN] IS GIVEN A MAGIC TICKET, AND WHILE HE'S WATCHING HIS MOVIE HERO'S LATEST FILM, HE ENDS UP BEING A PART OF THE ACTION. THIS STAR-STUDDED ACTION MOVIE IS OK, TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT FOR REAL, HOW DID AN INGMAR BERGMAN STORY GET INTO THIS MOVIE? ANYWAY, THE MOVIE STARTS OUT GREAT, BUT MOST OF THE SECOND HOUR IS A DISSAPOINTMENT. AS ALWAYS, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS FUN TO WATCH AS JACK SLATER, THE MOVIE COP WHO'S THE BOY'S IDOL. CHARLES DANCE IS COOL AS THE VILLAIN WHO MURDERED SLATER'S SECOND COUSIN. THIS MOVIE FEATURES APPEARANCES BY MANY STARS, SUCH AS; JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME, LITTLE RICHARD, TINA TURNER, TORU TANAKA, ART CARNEY, AND MANY MORE. FAR FROM ARNOLD'S BEST, BUT IT AIN'T A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Arnold Is Best Portraying Himself,"This movie has a campy charm to it. Self-referential comedy can be fun, as when the ""real"" Arnold argues with Maria over plugging his business interests at public events. The Stallone digs are good too. Enjoy this movie for what it is, cotton candy for the mind."
4,Self-Deconstructing,"This is probably the most self-deconstructing film of all time (something that literary and film students could have a blast with) -- plus, it is action-packed and full of laughs. A winner!"
4,"Strange Sense Of Humor, But Entertaining.","It is neither your typical movie, nor Arnold's typical movie. It is silly, but pack with continuous action and comedy. So tune-up your expectations for a brainless, silly, and funny action-adventure film, and you can actually enjoy this one."
1,poor quality,"This coupler broke almost the instant I first used it-- the metal clasp fell apart and was not repairable. The thing is, my dogs are 25 and 15 pounds-- not the kind of hulking beasts that should destroy a brand new product. I would not recommend buying this coupler."
2,Not for Huskies!,"I own two huskies, who walk fairly well on a leash. I thought this item would make it alot easier for me to walk the two together, but I was wrong. The clip that does the adjustment of the lenght isn't strong enough. It was constantly allowing slippage and the lenght that I had set between the two dogs was becoming larger. I would not recommend this item for dogs over 50 pounds that like to have a tight lead. My dogs don't drag me down the street, but they aren't the greatest walkers either, and this just plain didn't work for them."
1,poor quality.,"I recently purchased this item and the second time I took the dogs out the coupler broke at the metal adjuster. I do not recommend purchasing this product, although I have not had any problems with other sporn products."
5,Great,"I am a woman, but bought these because I have large feet and wide calves. They are great, sturdy boots in an unobtrusive color. They have sufficient support in the feet so they don't hurt after a few hours of standing around. They weren't very expensive and they keep my feet dry. What more could I want?"
3,Big Wide and did I say Big?,The boots are made for men really. If you are a woman make sure you take a size smaller than your usual shoe size. They are very wide so are very good for wider calves. My main issue with them though is that your feet don't breath inside them. You definitely can't wear them for more than a couple of hours.
5,Great Boots!,"My only negative observation is that they don't hold heat very well. They weren't designed to, so it's fine by me."
1,The New Becoming Vegetarian: The Essential Guide To a Healthy Vegetarian...,I returned the book for a refund.I already have a great deal of reading material on the benefits of a Vegetarian diet so did not need another book on this subject. There were only a few recipes so I did not wish to keep the book.Virginia A. Dickey
2,It was alright..,"I know some people would consider this book essential to vegetarian life but I read it. I was not impressed. It was incredibly boring. And no, its not because it didn't have pictures. It was just not that interesting. As for vegetarian reading, there are better books out there."
5,First book to read when you decide to go veg,This book is an excellent reference for new vegetarians. It answers any nutrition questions you may have about how to go vegetarian healthfully. I've been veg for a couple of years now and thanks to the info from this book I feel comfortable that I am doing it right.
5,Excellent resource,"I have purchased a few books on vegetarianism, and this is the most informative. As a new vegetarian who is still learning, I feel that the authors are not snobs about the subject. They clearly feel that the lifestyle is the healthiest, but I think they make an effort to be objective and accepting of those who do not adopt a strictly vegan menu. Additionally, their book so far is the most informative. I am learning so much about nutrients and how they affect each other. Even if you do not ultimately choose a vegetarian lifestyle, the book is an excellent choice if you just want to learn how to eat better."
5,Great guide,-easy to understand - helps make transition smooth. I recommend this to anyone wanting to become a vegetarian or just wants to eat healthy.
2,Not good,"There are some good informations, but the recipes are awfull and I can't believe that, with all the researches underlying that soy is bad for us in many ways, almost in all of them there's soy, also they don't say that eating frequently seitan is not a good idea if you want to protect the calcium in your bones and that if you're celiac you mustn't eat it at all."
2,Not That Useful,"Contents would have been okay if free but wasn't worth the price. What little I learned from the book I either knew or could have found easily on the Internet. This was more of a ""Why"" book then a ""How"" book. Some recipes included but not enough to really be helpful with eating vegetarian, especially factoring in ingredients that will be hard to find.It's equivalent to buying a book because you want to repair your car but getting a book that just tells you how it works in general with out telling you any significant specifics on repair."
4,vegetarian,"A good beginner book for anyone thinking about eating no meat, or just even cutting back on meat. Recipes are interesting."
4,The New Becoming Vegetarian: The Essential Guide To A Healthy Vegetarian Diet,Ignorance might not be bliss if you are giving up meat. THE NEW BECOMING VEGETARIAN has the information you need to develop a healthy eating pattern. It is approachable and you will stay healthy with it.
1,Useless Kindle version,"This book was converted to Kindle content using tables for almost everything. As a result, there's 10-15% of the content that extends off the screen and cannot be read. This is annoying in the beginning parts of the book, where you may lose a sentence or two, but is simply unusable in the recipes section where several recipe steps may be missing. The publisher should never have released such an obvious hack of a Kindle edition and should hire a proofreader."
5,la mejor cancion de 1999,"""Una Cancion"" (numero tres) es la mejor cancion de 1999 y las otras canciones son buenas tambien. Si, le gusta 'rock' va a gustar este grupo."
5,Shaking out the Roots,"Four measures of jazz comping behind Mountain Music Giant, Ralph Stanley is enough to entice you to hear out the rest of the project. Like nothing you'll hear anywhere else, the merging of folk, bluegrass, fusion, Klez, and straight-ahead jazz by this acoustic ensemble retains the identity of each ingredient, without beating the cake batter into tasteless pulp.Flavorful. Captivating.Come on folks, we want more!"
5,Best cover ever????,"I probably shouldn't write a review until I get the CD, which I'm ordering now. I heard ""High On A Mountain"" on our local community radio station this morning (KRCL, SLC, Utah) and it knocked my socks off... this may very well be the best cover of any song by any band! Not only was the delivery on the vocals excellent, but the fiddle really pulled it together.Then I saw the lineup... Matt Glaser, Andy Statman, Tony Trishka... it all made sense. I'm a fan of Jazz, Bluegrass, Folk, etc, so the other reviews discussing the mix of styles just intrigued me more. I can't wait to hear the rest!"
3,Sony STR-DE 1075 is Good But ..,"The Sony STR 1075 has 6.1 and a host of other features. But, many movies and DVDs are not even in 5.1. The receiver has excellent connectivity options, and automated detection of type of signal. The electronics are sound. For a sophisticated electronic device, I find the user manual very weak. It barely covers the basics, and is not well written. Also, Sony has the idea that crowding the remote with buttons is good. It's not. Many of the buttons are set-up related and should be under a flip-top, not comingled with all the ""every day"" buttons."
1,Not compatible with Vista!!!!,Belkin does not offer a Vista driver for this product. Don't waste your money if you're running Vista!
5,Belkin F5U228 Hi-Speed USB 2.0 DVD Creator,"We had tried several different USB DVD Creators prior to this one and found they would not work properly and caused problems for our software, after purchasing the Belkin our system has work great!!"
3,Only for Otis Spann devotees,"This CD is special because it Otis's last public performance. The music is fine, and Peter Malick has done a fine job in recovering the 25 year old tapes. My problem with the CD is Lucille's singing. She clearly *can* sing, and is a natural blues singer, but why did she have to shout and scream? The distortion produced by Lucille's outbursts is compounded by (apparently), poor quality microphones. I'm sorry, but I'm a little old fashioned. I can't accept that *anyone* needs to shout in order to show that they are a strong singer.I do recommend this album, but only if you know Otis Spann. If you are looking for blues piano albums, and you are new to Otis Spann, then I strongly suggest that you look at ""Otis Spann Is The Blues"" and ""The Blues Is Where It's At"". Very fine albums."
3,A good live show in parts,Otis sounds great as does his wife and Peter Malick. The problem that I had with the performance is that Luther Johnson's guitar is way out of tune for the whole set. I have stop listening after a while. It would have been a great recording otherwise. Just my 2 cents.
5,50s Junk Pile jigsaw puzzle,The picture is beautiful. Too bad part of the picture on the cover of the box is obscured by overprinting.
3,Eehh,"I've had this receiver since 2001 and it is good (not great, not terrible). The sound produced is fine, the power is fine, the fact that it has a lot of inputs (including 1 (or 2?) digital) is convenient and it is easy to set up. I have had some problems with the CD (not digital) inputs on several different pieces. All in all, it is fine for a receiver, great for the money, but now there is much better out there (if you have the cash). Considering you can get this for under $200, why not?"
3,Good Starting Receiver,"Has ample power and features. The bad part is that is has no bass, treble, or equalizer settings that can be changed. If you like to fine tune and play with different settings, this is not the receiver. If you want a receiver that has Dolby Digital, DTS, Surround etc this will do the job for you."
5,I cant believe it!!!!!,"I can't say enough about this product. I have never, never had nice nails. So I bit them. I thought why bother. So on a spur of the moment kinda thing, I bought the formula 2. I've been using it for two months. Oh my god.I have really nice nails. They are long and strong and when I went home for a vacation, my long time friends thought they were fake. Hee hee. If you ever thought you couldn't grow beautiful nails, try this product. This is the first time I have ever wrote a review. But this product worked so well for me, It was worth the time it took to tell you about it.."
4,Hoping for strong nails,"After using this nail strengthener it seemed to be working till my nails severely began splitting as what usually happens when I use nail polish. If my nails would just stop splitting, I think this really would do the trick to strengthen nails."
5,Good stuff!,I've used this product several times after discontinuing the use of acrylic nails and it has brought tissue paper nails back to being strong. I highly recommend.
1,"Nailtiques 2, not 2 Plus","The product was advertised as Nailtiques 2 Plus, which is what I wanted, not just the ""2"" formula. So, I was not happy after waiting for it, to be the wrong thing. I should have returned it, but I can't get around much, since I am in a cast. Do not order from this vendor if you want Nailtiques 2 Plus."
5,Stands the test of time,"I was given the first edition of this book when my son was born 33 years ago. It became my go-to manual for every aspect of childcare - from the technical to the practical to the spiritual to the emotional to the FUN! The book really focused my attitude on the joy of caring for a child while dealing with all the challenges. The writing is so personal - it feels like a conversation with a wise older friend. I've gifted this book to young mothers for 30 years and have re-read the entire book recently. It's still so up-to-date and fresh. If you just buy one childcare book, this is it!!"
5,practical advice,"Many years ago I received a version of this book. I turned to it again and again since I was the first of all my friends to have a baby and I lived too far away from my mom to call with every little question or concern. I loaned it out numerous times and everyone liked it. However, I never got it back the last time - my guess is that the last person I loaned it to loved it and kept it. So when another of my friends got pregnant recently I bought her the book. She loves it too. It gives practical advice with a touch of humor which made me keep my sanity over the years. My kids are now grown into young successful adults but this is the one and only book I remember from those early years so that says alot."
3,Nifty,"I bought this so I could eliminate my Flextone II while still having the sound and presets I used it for. This has allowed me to do this. I'm not such a huge fan of this whole modeling phase we seem to be going through, as it seems to have stifled innovation a bit.Still if you want an amp modeling software this will probably do the trick. If you want something to cook chicken on I would try something else."
5,very rare film cllips is worth the price of this dvd.,"this is one good dvd about the british invasion because it features rare never-before-seen film clips of very popular british groups of the 60's. i would recommend this for all those british invasion buffs because some of the film clips were performed live, others were lip-synched but still very nice to watch to reminisce days of the 60's. highly recommended."
1,LowLife,Sony low life battery. Should last more than 1 year. It would be cheaper to buy another vendor's camera and use akaline (throw-away) batteries. Why should this thing cost [$$$] dollars?
1,Ugh - Low Life!,"Like the other reviewers, the NP-FS11 that came with our DCR-PC5 camcorder stopped taking a charge after about 18 months. This is with very limited usage (maybe we've recorded a total of 3 hours of tape - and taken a few hundred digital still photos.) I have not bothered contacting Sony, but am thinking that I might need to spend a bit more on the NP-FS21 or NP-FS31 to see if I can get around this problem in the future. Doesn't look like replacing my NP-FS11 will be worth it based on everyone elses' experience."
1,it's the baaaad battery!!!!,"I have the {VERY EXPENSIVE} quick charger, and I still have the same problem with the battery. I am sure the battery is defective, not the camera. I ordered my camera while stationed in Iraq, so you can imagine my frustration, as it is extremely difficult to remedy the problem from here."
1,np-fs11,i have a case for underwater photography and it does great but my story is the same as the rest on mine the battery low blinks and blinks but will last 15 min were it used to last two dives or two hours without tv on cause it heated up and would fog but i was wondering if the np-fs21 is the same size as the 11 cause i hate to buy another battery but im going to have to cause i need two batterys for dives what can we do to complain ty greg
3,WOW! I'm not alone!!,"I have the same problems. Unfortunately it wasn't until AFTER the vacation that I found out the information on the battery. Quite honestly I wasn't having any problems with the batteries. Finally one day while on vacation after charging it up, the indicator started flashing. (The one with the battery with the slash through it). I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-P50.Believe it or not as long as I have the flash on, I can take a bunch of pics as suggested. Unfortunately I didn't know this while on vacation so I missed taking some awesome pics. But it's ok. Glad to know I'm not alone!!rj"
2,Sony NPFS11 Camcorder Battery,I was reading the reviews about this battery and saw how many people are facing the same problem. I would like to be added to the list of people complaining as I have (for a long time) had the same problem with these batteries. I have a Sony DSC-F505. I hope Sony will soon come out with a solution to our problem although I doubt it.
1,Hopeless,"I purchased a DSC-P1 camera with an extra NP-FS11 battery in October 2001. Even when these batteries were in peak condition they did not last more than a few hours (providing use of the screen was heavily rationed) In August 2002 I purchased another battery as the first two were not providing much battery life. It is now Jan 2003 and all three batteries are completely dead and will not hold more than about 3 minutes of charge. If Sony charged ""less"" for these things I would not mind so much, but to blow about ""a big amount of money"" on 3 batteries one of which is dead after 5 months is ridiculous. I quite like the DSC-P1, but I would not buy another Sony product requiring a rechargable battery because of the hopeless performance of this battery."
1,Thought it was just me !!!,"I, too, have had a bad experience with my NP-FS11. The first one died just over a year after I bought the camera (DSC-P1). I bought a second one and it died about 3 months afterward !!!I don't know if this is because of the camera or the battery. I have been thinking about getting my 3rd battery but lucky that I saw these reviews from Amazon.com. I may just hold off getting a new battery if this problem seems to be too common. After all it ain't cheap !!!"
4,Go to Sony support site for advice on battery life,"I had 2 batteries that lasted 3 years. I guess I was lucky, ormaybe just did not use the batteries enough.That being said, perhaps the following link to Sony customer support describes the problem everyone is having with the low battery life. Good luck.http://www.ita.sel.sony.com/support/news/dscp1svc.html"
1,Sony Infolithium short life battery,"Having purchased two of these batteries with my camcorder, I was rather unimpressed to find that they offered less use time than the battery on my rechargeable razor. These things are not what they are made out to be. Bad news is you don't seem to have much choice but to buy Sony and pay the price!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I HAVE BOUGHT SONY NP-FS11 BATTERY FROM THIS SELLER AND IT WAS NOT WORKING, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW..."
2,Don't count on it for more than 12 months,"I have no complaints about this battery, other than it would only work for 12 months. After that, it just refuses to charge. I have a Sony Cybershot DSC-P50, and the only way to use that camera is with this battery (actually, you can use 2AA, but it will only take a couple of pics). After 11 months of using it, my first battery refuse to recharge, and I called Sony Customer service, who send me a new one (great service!). However, now, after 10 months of use, the same it's happening. Will they send me a new one? I don't think so, but it just seems like the battery has a big problem. I'm thinking about buying a new camera 'cause of this, maybe a Canon S30."
2,Poor longevity,I'm a little upset that I have to replace this battery after just two years light use. It's probably been recharged around 30 times and now won't hold a charge at all.
2,OK for 18 months use,"I generally love Sony products, and have a whole bunch lying around the house. This battery came with my digital camera and for 18 months worked great. Recently, it started refusing to hold a charge giving me a couple of photo's before running out even though the camera showed the battery as fully charged initially. A lot of other users have also suffered this fate with this battery. Unfortunately, as I love the camera I'll have to fork out for another one as there are no alternatives. For getting less than two years service, for the cost these batteries seem pretty expensive to me."
3,Great recharging info,"I too had the low battery problem. I followed the instructions here about taking pic after pic with the flash until the battery runs out. I also saw the note about pausing and when I paused for a while the battery indicator came on with 77 mins left. Now dumping the pics off the camera and the timer went up to 106 minutes.We will see how long the high charge numbers last......thanks for the posting, you saved me some bucks too!"
1,Entirely Unproductive,"This book was assigned me by a professor for a master's class. Throughout the week I have been plodding through it, and as I sit here preparing to write on it I find myself losing respect for very degree I am earning. A masters in education cannot mean what I thought it did if this is the kind of postmodernist pablum that passes for thoughtful discourse. Unabashed leftism is the rule in education in the United States, but this book even offends those it purports to befriend.Simplistic. Thoughtlessly antagonistic. It adds nothing but poison to the great American experiment."
3,has its moments,this album is OKAY. i heard Denile on the radio and thought it had a catchy chorus...so i bought Home....not the greatest...i'll take Korn or Limp Bizkit over these guys any day. Bender makes this album worth while
3,KoRn with a better vocalist,"I heard my drum teacher regard this band as the next Pantera, which prompted me to get into this band. He pbviously must have been talking about their latest album, because this one was typical numetal. The guitarists use the 7-strings and try to get the some of the weirdest possible sounds out of them and not too complex riffs nothing really special here. I must admit that there are some really danceable tracks here and the singer has a great vioce, especially when paired with the female vocalist on licking cream. But other than that nothing other than a listinable album to pass the time. If you're just getting into the band start out with their first album."
2,Boring and the same rehashed riffs over and over agian,"The lyrics aren't that wonderful (I guess their ok), the guitars just flat out suck, and every song is so freaking similar. Bands like this makes me wonder about the how great the music scene is now days."
1,What a waste of money!,"Reading the reviews below it's hard to believe that I have heard the same album as these people descibe. The critics review of this album is totally accurate. The bland, repetive songs lack any melodic hooks. The first Sevendust album was amazing, this one has left me regretting. Listen to a friend's copy to hear for yourself. Save your money."
3,dont own it yet but sounds pretty good,"even though i dont own this cd yet ive listened to alot of the songs, waffle, denial, bender, and rumble fish. i like how heavy they sound on this cd and the drumming is very good too. some of the chorus's with the exception of denial and waffle kind of annoy me for some reason but still good. ill write a full review when i listen to the whole cd"
2,Did I miss something here?,"Sorry, but this album didn't impress me at all. The riffs are really short and distorted, and try too hard to be heavy, but aren't. The solos (if you can even call them that) are more of the ""use your distortion to make noise"" technique that many nu-metal bands seem to be picking up these days, and the repetition is ridiculous. It's very easy to listen to this album, and think you accidentally hit ""repeat"". The vocals are not bad, the guy can actually sing, but a lot of the time he just gets on my nerves, and the guy screaming in the background is even worse. The only good song is ""Denial"", because it's different from the rest, but that's not really enough to save this album. The female vocalist on ""Licking Cream"" is cool, but Chino Moreno is (as always) just irritating. I don't see any point in buying this. If you like this stuff, go buy some Staind or Godsmack, or (the ultimate) Alice in Chains, but this just ain't worth it."
2,1 great song does not an album make,"Sadly, what we have hear is a classic case of a whole album riding on the success of one good song: ""Waffle."" I listened and tried but only ""Headtrip"" offered some truly trippy guitar work - not enough for repeated listens, though. They've got a decent sound. The singer's voice is great for a heavy band. The songs themselves just don't cut it. Tried hard to like this, but don't."
1,Home Fails to Meet the High Standards that the Debut Created,"After buying and falling in love with the edge crushing debut by Sevendust, I have to wonder just what they were trying to accomplish on their sophomore effort. This album is nothing like the debut. Where the music should be hard, it is not, where Lajon should be wailing my ears off, I hear a melodic woman's voice. Sevendust has officially joined the group ""I Was At the Top of My Game and Then I Went Bombastic and S**t"", along with Korn, Metallica, and Megadeth. Stick with the debut."
5,Best Cd in a while,"This cd is great. Most of the cd's i get have a few good songs and the rest kills space. This cd i can listen from #1 to the end and it is ALL good. They really rock hard and its great to listen to on ""those"" days i love it"
3,Their self-titled was better.,"If you want to buy something from Sevendust, buy their self-titled cd. This one is not that heavy and is kinda boring. I got tired of this cd in less than a week."
4,"Not Bad, not bad at all","I bought this album yesterday and can gladly say that after my Machine Head mishap (you can read my review on Machine Head's new album ""The Burning Red"" if you wish), I was pleased to see this band still producing good tunes. This album is a decent follow-up album to Sevendust's first album. It doesnt supercede their first album by any means, but it should definitely keep Sevendust fans sated. I'm not sure if I consider Sevendust as the next big ""soft"" metal band for the new millenium, but they DO know how to continue what they started. I didnt give this new one five stars because some of the songs sound too much the same creating a redundant feel, but the album is still good overall."
4,Hard Hitting in your face metal!,"This album is ten times better than their first release. Songs like ""Home"" ""Bender"" and the first single ""Denial"" are excellent. He doesn't rap alot, and there isn't alot of turntable action just kick @$$ metal. I gave it four stars because it doesn't really change throughout the cd which makes alot of the songs sound alike, but this is probably one of the better new metal bands out there."
3,could it be any more average,"Since metal first came around back in the early 70s, it has become more and more varied as a genre. Everything from death to thrash to black to progressive to power to hair metal has popped up over the years. And a lot of it has been damn good. Excellent in fact, and thats whats the problem here. The new Sevendust album isn't exactly bad, its pretty average in fact, but these days that dosn't cut it anymore. Not when other fantastic artists like Nevermore, Machine Head and Meshuggah (to name a few) have so much better music to offer. The songs offer little in the way of variety and all show average songwriting skills. The lyrics again aren't bad but nothing fancy at all. If this was my first metal album i'd have to say i'd be impressed, but with so much other excellent metal out there, being average hardly means anything. It is a step above the first album though (as if that was a difficult feat)"
5,Incredible Sophomore Effort,"I loved the first Sevendust album and couldn't wait for this album, especially after catching their blistering set at Woodstock this summer. Luckily, I was not disapppointed with this incredible album. Every song is extremely hard yet highly melodic. The title track, which opens the album , is unreal. I also love the track ""Licking Cream"", with Skin from Skunk Anansie. If you liked their first album at all, or are just looking for a great album to kick you in your a**, pick up ""Home"". You won't regret it."
2,You call this original?,"I bought this album hoping they would be as cool as Korn and Limp Bizkit, but Sevendust can't compare. Their guitar beats aren't original, the singing is horrible, and their sound is terrible. I may not be a big fan of heavy metal in general (that's why I gave it two stars, for everyone who is), but I know good music when I hear it, and sevendust just sucks."
3,decent effort overall...,"I've had this CD for a long while. Although I've yet to hear their self-titled debut, this one has more industrial leanings to it. Overall, this album is good. However, the band could use a little more focus and direction instead of playing the same riffs over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this band is talented, it's just that I believe that they can definitely fulfill their potential. Best tracks: Home, Denial, Headtrip, Rumble Fish."
5,Its the stuff,Great album. Very good 2nd album. Some awsome tracks my favourite of which would probably be Denial. All the tracks are good none could be said to let the album down. Brilliant go buy it now if your a metal fan.
4,sevendust rock,sevendust is a real good band and i think 2000 will be a big year for them i think home is better than the first album my favorite song is denial and bender (which also includes guest vocals by the deftones chino moreino) if you like metal but dilike this album go see a sevendust concert they sound even better live
3,Nothing great but definitely good,"Palm mutes are cool and all but enough is enough. The first song is a complete bomb, mostly because of the palm mutes. What is that? Dramatic pauses? Please. It sounds horrible. Then again there are many spots on the album that made me sit with my jaw hanging open mumbling ""god damn..."". I'd definitely reccomend this cd, but there's a lot of better stuff out there."
2,repetative,"I heard ""Headtrip"" off a compilation and loved the wickedly awesome catchy guitar riff and was surprised coz the singer could actually sing and thats not something you hear a lot with these metal bands. So i decided to get ""Home"" i tried to give it a chance but i found that the songs were all extremely repetetive and seemed to all sound the same. Every song is basically a main crunchy riff with slow vocals and screaming choruses. not much variation here."
5,This Album is Fantastic!,"Having just got this, I have to say that it's one of the best albums I have ever heard. There just isn't a bad track on the entire thing. Get it now! NOWW!"
4,This is a good CD!,"I started liking SEVENDUST since i heard ""Denial"". So i baught the CD and I am very happy that i did that. It took me a while to get into the music but after i started to listen to it enough i fell in love with it. ""Home"" and ""Denial"" are very good songs. Actually, every song on the CD is good! ""Rumble Fish"" is probably my favorite song. It has the same style as Limp Bizkit's ""Trust"". If you like Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Static-X, and Rage, then i strongly recomend this cd."
4,SELF-TITLED BETTER,"Don't get me wrong. This album is very good. My favorite songs are ""Denial"", ""Waffle"", ""Reconnect"", and ""Rumble Fish"" on this album, but their first album didn't compare to this. Songs like ""Black"", ""Terminator"", ""Face"", ""Will it Bleed"", ""Too Close to Hate"", and ""Wired"" are really incredible. If you like singles like Denial or Waffle, you'll love their self-titled album."
4,FROM LEFT TO RIGHT...Right to the register and buy the CD!,"I've never heard the bands music until I bought ""Home"" and it is definitely one of the best metal CDs to come out this year. The song ""Licking Cream"" is by itself worth buying the CD(with guest vocals from Skin of Skunk Anasie). The lyrics are simple and sometimes don't make sense(like ""from left to right"" repeated over and over in ""Home"") but the music and vocals more than make up for it."
5,i love this cd!,this cd has the best guitar playing ever! what an amazing band. this band has some good talent. home is a really good cd. you people have to get this cd for some very good music.
2,Has two really good songs.,"This album has two really good songs - Waffle and Licking Cream (with a good guest vocalist). Denial is not bad, but the yelling or screaming on almost every song is annoying as hell. I don't know why singers can't just stick to singing without the chanting/yelling that seems to be getting more and more popular. The two great songs almost make it worth buying, though."
5,This album is not for most people,"this album is something really special, I bought it after I bought slipknot and at first I thought it was nothing special, after I got tired slipknot I started listening to this album and as I listened to it more I started paying attetion to it and I loved it, This is one of my all time favorites, if you're too much into death metal you probably won't like this much, but if you have any knowledge of music you will love this, I recommend this to anyone but I won't say that it'll be your favorite.This bad should get a lot more attention, Sevendust is something really special, the first album is also very good, I love them both."
4,This is sum heavy sh.... i mean stuff!,"I liked this album for sumone who doesnt normally like the heavy, scary metal stuff, but i have to admit this is sum great music, i think ""waffle"", ""denial"" and ""insecure"" are the three best tracks of the 13 that sevendust offers this time around... however their were a few loose ends... i didnt like some of the sounds, and the songs ""Feel So"", ""Grasshopper"" and ""Crumbled"" didnt really appeal to me much..... but all in all this is a great album and it deserves the 4 stars that i so generously gave it...."
4,"no bad songs, and quite a few greats.","I am not a headbanger, but when I heard the song ""Denail"", which featured heavy metal-like guitars but un-heavy metal-like vocals. I decided to try the album, and liked what I heard tremendously. There were other songs as good as Denial in the same way(Reconnect and Bender), and also there was not a single song I could not listen through."
3,"Okay, but not as good as their first","This one is more industrial. More noise without the harmony, all of the songs sound similar. But the first one, borrow this one."
3,"Half good,Half bad","I had heard alot of good things about this band before going to buy their CD.What I should have done is buy their 1st album before the 2nd. There are some good songs on this album like ""Denial',""Reconnect"",""Waffle"",Licking Cream"",and ""Bender"".I could really do without all of the screaming background vocals.They totally kill all the good stuff frontman Lajon Witherspoon is trying to do with the songs.The songs are heavy & fast guys, just lay off the screaming so much,&you guys would have a very kick ass record."
4,Sevendust - HOME,"I bought this album as I knew that Skin from Skunk Anansie was singing on it. I had never heard Sevendust before (I come from the UK.) When I played the album I was surprised as they were actually really really good. A number of the songs sound very similar, which would be my only criticism, however 'Licking Cream' is one of the best songs ever written. Skins voice is beautiful and it has become one of my favourite songs. Other songs I like on the album are Denial, Home, Crumbled and Rumble Fish. Overall it's a really good album and I might look into buying the first one."
4,HOME-BOYZ,"THIS CD REALLY TOOK ME BY SURPRISE, I HEARD OF SEVENDUST BEFORE (THE POPULAR SONG; BLACK) BUT NEVER GAVE THEM A SECOND THOUGHT, UNTIL I HAPPENED TO PURCHASE THEIR LATEST CD OUT OF CURIOSITY. AND MOST OF THE SONGS, WERE ""OFF THE HOOK"" ESPECIALLY ""DENIAL"" WHICH LYRICS, WERE SIMULAR TO MY SITUATION, THESE GUYS AI'NT NO HOOPTIE & THE BLOWFISH! THEY KICK MAJOR @$$"
2,Nothing special,"This album was alright. Sevendust is one of those bands I just can't get into for some reason. The only song that I liked was 'Licking Cream' which featured Skin from Skunk Anansie. He singing was the high point of the CD, and thats not good when it's not her bands album. There wasn't much that set the rest of the CD apart from anything else. These guys are good...I just don't see anything original here."
3,its ok...,"hey ok well this isnt the best cd, they sound kinda like staind and its kinda like boring but some of the songs are really good i love denial licking cream and bender! all in all i think this is a good cd but it would be better if it were more heavy metal and yeh kno a little more energetic.."
5,A must read,"If you are interested in fashion, this is a must read. The House of Klein is a fantastic book. The author shares the story of Calvin Klein with all the intimate details of his life and business. This is a book not to be missed!"
2,Not much juice,"I expected to get a lot more from this book and was sadly disappointed. I hoped to read more about Calvin Klein's life and found myself struggling through dry chapters about corporate sales and whatnot. I went into it knowing this was a business book but thought it could've been better. It might be ok for people who read the Wall Street Journal regularly (then again, if that's the case, you probably would know everything in the book anyway). If you're just a fan of fashion and more interested in Klein's clothes and a biography of him, this is not the book for you."
4,Need to spend 90 minutes distracted and smiling?,"This is nonsense, and doesn't pretend to be anything else.When you're in a cranky mood and want to forget your problems sit down with this and a bowl of popcorn."
5,Father's Day Gift,We have seen this movie several times & laughed just as hard each time. I ordered it for my husband for Father's Day. It is a must have movie!! If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor & watch it.
5,it was hilarious,i loved it. its great to laugh that hard. i would definitely recommend it to my friends and family members
4,Soap Dish DVD,I have enjoyed watching this movie more than once. Kevin Cline's humor is excellent...all of the cast is great! I would buy it again.
3,Soap Dish is Hilarious,"I have always loved this movie. I was sooo happy to find it on Amazon! I had to wait a whole week for it, but that's because other movies I ordered were not available yet. It was certainly worth the wait. Still as funny to me as it was back in the day! DVD was brand new."
5,great product DVD,"I received this product. I had told seller when I needed it for a gift and he made sure I got it. The packaging was great. Overall ***** very satisfied, would order from this seller again."
5,Hilarious,"A sopa opera star diva facing career doldrums is challenged by the sudden re-apperance of her ex who is also the father of their daughter. But, wait, the daughter thinks her mother is her aunt and she has a date with her father who doesn't know she is his daughter. Confused? Don't be. This is but the tip of the iceberg in this incredible comedy about the soap opera world. Sally Field is without peer as the hapless diva. Kevin Kline is incredible as the has-been ex. Elizabeth Shue is terrific as the returned daughter (niece?)....Relax, get some popcorn and enjoy. Don't miss a very Murphy-Browneske Garry Marshall as the producer."
5,One of the best comedies in a century!,"Fast-paced and unpredictable, this is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. I've always loved this movie. Now I can memorize the lines, which are hallarious. Sallie Field's delivery is unmatched and Whoopi just pushes it that much more over the top. The movie pokes fun at not only the daytime soaps but also the prime time soaps we all used to watch - like Dynasty and Falcon Crest. Enjoy!! I know I did.. and will over and over again."
5,SOAPDISH,"Kevin Kline, Sally Field, Whoopi Goldberg, Terri Hatcher, Robert Downey Jr., Elizabeth Shue, and Cathy Moriority all get together to make this one of the FUNNIEST movies I have ever seen. WE LOVE THIS MOVIE - so it was only natural that we buy the DVD to have waiting under the tree this Christmas. WHAT A HIT!!! If you've never seen this one - BUY IT!!"
3,Fun and funnier!,"This movie is funny, witty, and just downright fun! It has an all-star cast, with the standout being good ol' Robert Downey, Jr. But I'm biased--I love all his work. His talent shines again. He plays a producer who only cares about one thing--himself. And he will do whatever it takes to take care of himself, no matter who is involved. Kevin Kline is also a great, having some of the best lines in the film. This is a great Sunday afternoon film. Try it. And see for yourself why I love Downey."
2,Has funny moments but not enough this movie could of been why more funny,"Good concept for a movie but bad outcome. The film is set behind the scenes at The Sun Also Sets, a soap opera starring Sally Field that is suffering a ratings slump. To gain back ratings the creators bring back a dead star played by Kevin Kline, with whom Field and him where lovers. Whoopi Goldberg, and Cathy Moriarty steal away all the scene's they are in. There are good moments but not enough. The movie was boring and was flat and had no life. Overall it was ok and had some funny parts but wont be good enough to make you liek the film."
5,Wonderful! Funny!,"If you grew up watching soap operas or had to watch them for a living as I did (yes, seriously) you will LOVE THIS MOVIE! Super performances by all, especially Cathy Moriarty. Even my husband loves this flick! Highly recommended!"
4,Soaps should all be this hilarious,"A talented cast, a screwball script, and fast-paced direction come together to create a fun-filled movie. Silliness and overacting add to the madcap flavor of ""Soapdish"". A good film to watch on a gloomy day. If you enjoy Sally Fields and Kevin Kline's comic genius, you will surely enjoy them in these roles."
4,Just a really funny movie!,"So silly, so funny -- the near-sighted Kevin Kline trying to read his cue cards (bran flavor? brake fluid? brain fever!), Whoopie Goldberg's exasperated writer (what do you mean bring him back? He was de-capitated! How am I going to write for someone without a head?!). Great cast, funny funny movie."
2,Disappointing quality sound and picture.,"This is a disappointing set as a lot of the film clips are poor quality. There are some good ones,like a color film clip where the Who perform live,but the many poor quality ones spoil it.For example,there is a poor live performance by Cream which has terrible sound and poor picture quality. There is a James Brown clip(filmed in B&W)where he is obviously miming on his own. Compare this to the Ed Sullivan DVDs where James Brown performs live with a huge band backing him and you can see that this is a very average collection of DVDs. I would recommend either the Ed Sullivan,Music Scene or Hullabaloo Music DVDs as they are much better quality than this mediocre set."
2,If you like lipsinking,If you like lipsinking you will like this set. There are some live performances but most are TV show performances with lipsinking. I was disappointed.
3,It's promising but....,"If only I could cross this with the Baby Bjorn bib. I love the flexibility of this bib, but it is hard to fasten on my 11-month-old. I just wish it fastened on the side, like the Baby Bjorn, instead of at the back of the neck. Baby just hates to have it put on."
4,"IKEA look, IKEA value, IKEA quality","From its appearance, this TV stand would seem flimsy and unreliable. However, it is quite sturdy and of high quality. It is not the biggest entertainment unit out there, but it functions quite well for me. Ideally suited to those with a small to moderate amount of equipment, this unit is versatile enough to accomodate my 27' TV, a DVD-Player, VCR and stereo. The open space in the rear is great for wiring, as you can easily access everything and adding a back panel afterwards (like I did), hides the wires perfectly. For someone with a limited budget, small amount of electronics, confined quarters and an eye for interesting design I'd recommend this unit."
4,What About the Browns?,"No, not the Cleveland Browns of the NFL, but the St. Louis Browns. With the Cardinals still playing ball in St. Louis, the storied if sometimes depressing history of the Browns is so often forgotten. In this title we get a glimpse of the 1944 season, when two neighboring teams that did not play in New York faced off for Baseball's ultimate prize. Of course, World War II had created manpower shortages among the better teams that allowed the lowly Browns to win their first and last pennant, but that is immaterial. Those who were unfortunate enough to call themselves Browns' fans got one season to remember before their team left for greener pastures in Baltimore, MD. If you can get a hold of this title, you can marvel at the Midwestern version of the Brooklyn Dodgers."
3,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaghghghg,"Okay, I've had this little ""gem"" for 2 years now, and I've yet to program it properly. I can't seem to get the speakers to an optimum level at any time. It is far too complex, and the remoted does not control the cd player."
2,surprise,"(STR-DE885) I have bought many Sony products before, with one of the benefits being able to control them all with one remote. So it was a surprise to me when none of the Sony remotes could control this unit. If it does not make it easier, it goes back."
4,Found at last,"I've been looking for information about an old damaged recipe book that I picked up at a yard sale in an old country town in NY State. The front cover and all the first pages through page 12 are missing from my copy. But it is a wonderful cook book from ""the old days"". I believe this is the one I am looking for. I am excited. My only disappointment is that there are no pictures or information of the inside of the book, like the Index or the Contents. That would help me be absolutely sure that this is the book I want."
4,Packed full of interesting stuff,"David Crystal provides a well-researched, authoritative account of the stories of English other than Standard English - the dialects and differences. It is so dense (or so am I ) that I am still reading it, in small sections before going to sleep.Each time, I find fascinating new thoughts and insights into the English language and its development to the present time. Fantastic stuff."
2,Specialists Only,"Ugh! I tried, I really tried, but this was just too dry and academic. I liked the author's premise, and he certainly knows his stuff, but this is definitely not a book for the general reader. This is written like a textbook for a graduate level course in the various dialects of English. Not recommended for readers who do not already possess some expertise in this field."
3,Interesting but heavy going at times,"I am very pleased to have read this book, but I was glad to reach the end on page 534. I found the multitude of facts incredibly detailed and sometimes repetitive. The occasional flashes of humour and interesting snippets kept me going, particularly as the author came closer to modern times. This book is probably required reading for students of the English language. For interested amateurs it might at times prove to be heavy going."
4,Interesting book,"This book, as stated in the preface, unlike many other books on the history of the English language, tries to include nonstandard English forms as well, and the author also claims that he is not emphasizing England (as opposed to the rest of the English-speaking world) as much as is traditional. As another reviewer has pointed out, he does not succeed very well in the latter goal, but in the rest of his goals he succeeds very well.The book is quite thick and will not read quickly, but there is a lot of interesting material in it. I'm not very fond of his organization, where he has a chapter on the standard language followed by an ""interlude"" on nonstandard varieties, but at least he gets to cover both that way.I would recommend the book, but not so whole-heartedly that I'd give it a top rating."
3,More of a textbook than a good read,"After reading a glowing review of this book in the New York Times's Book Review section I had high hopes for ""The Stories of English"" by David Crystal. However, by about page twenty I knew I was in trouble. While the author makes some terrific points about the evolution of English, dialect changes and linguistic notations, this book just isn't an easy or pleasurable read. Since the bulk of the book mainly focuses on British English, as an American reader it didn't really pick up for me until toward the end when Crystal writes a chapter entitled ""New Horizons"".I can't easily recommend this book but I'm sure there are those who would find it to their liking. Two much more fascinating books about our language are Robert MacNeil's ""The Story of English"" and Simon Winchester's ""The Meaning of Everything""."
4,Great projector with average remote,"I purchased this projector to upgrade from the previous InFocus X2 model. The projector is great, but the remote is very basic. They removed the volume controls from remote and has no laser pointer. They are esentially getting you to buy their upgraded remote. I do a lot of presentations with video and need the ability to control volume."
4,"""Time Management"" in paperback","As a Social Worker leading two groups daily, this book has given me more time for my other duties. The book is geared towards all age levels, both adults and children, and can be adapted accordingly. There are pages which can be copied and used as written material for the clients, and some which can be used to reinforce the topic of group discussion. My co-workers come in and ask to borrow the book frequently and now have ordered the next editions. I strongly recommend this book to any professional who needs new creativity in leading groups."
3,"The product was fine, but the dropper didn't work!","I don't want to give this company a bad rating because I got the product in a timely manner and Red Clover is Red Clover give or take, right? It's just that the dropper didn't work! It is faulty so you have to just try and guess at the drops, poor it from the bottle. I am sure they weren't aware of that or they would have corrected it. I am enjoying having red clover and the price was very competitive. Just... check the container."
4,A GREAT FIND! by M. Boucher,"In the tradition of Jackie Collins, Brenda Joyce pens her first non-historical novel about Hollywood, and succeeds in doing so by entertaining us with two strong characters who are destined to be together. Belinda Glassman is a rich girl who wants to make it on her own. She meets Jack Ford, a sexy actor with a dark secret, and the two of them fall in love. But true to the form, problems arise for both... Juicy, engrossing, and very well written, LOVERS AND LIARS should please soap opera fans everywhere."
4,ROMANCE & LA LA LAND,"Brenda Joyce's first non-historical novel takes us into the Jackie Collins world of Hollywood where a rich but independent heroine has the hots for a bad boy turned actor with a past. True to the form, the path to hooking up is one bumpy ride, but Joyce's account toward this destination is a juicy, glossy, sexually-charged roman à clef that lifts from its first page and stays above water. The author evidently has fun with her subjects. (SPOILER AHEAD) Their hot and cold attitude towards one another satisfyingly builds up to a grand sparks-fly union destined to become happily ever after. Joyce's world of caviar and champagne may not always be original but the passion and dedication with which she writes make for a fun and exciting experience.-----Martin Boucher"
5,Gives the Heritage a Human Face,"The Westminster Confession has a lively reputation -- it is either loved or hated, depending on your theology. Everyone knows it is about the most influential work of its kind ever produced in the English language. But few people know anything about the men who composed it. This is the only book I know of that has composed biographical portraits of the Westminster Divines. What Dr. Barker so well illustrates is that these were a diverse group of churchmen, with different temperments and experiences. They were united by a common commitment to the Word and the threat of royal execution for their participation.Dr. Barker is a gifted historian and writer. He really makes these heroic figures come to life.This book will stir your heart and your head."
2,Beware when you float these floating candles.,"These candles are even cuter in person than they are in the picture. However, they're not as water resistant as I expected floating candles to be. If you burned them right away and had it done with, you'd be fine. But, if you want them as decorations in a bowl of water (as I did), they get very worn and faded, very quickly. They also made the water disgusting and a film got on the glass bowl that took a lot of scrubbing to get off."
3,Red Light Rita Review,The sizes are way too small. I normally wear a small but could have easily worn a medium in this outfit.
1,This CD [stinks],"This CD is sooooooo stupid. It has one track which is about 30 minutes long, & on that one track is a guy with an annoying English accent talking about Snoop's life. The most pathetic thing about it is that a ton of the stuff he says is wrong, that's right, WRONG! The only cool part is the few minutes of Snoop talking. This CD also comes with a 100 page full color picture book. Save your $$$ & buy a Snoop Dogg CD with music on it, cuz this CD [stinks] I would have given it no stars, but the lowest you can go is one star."
3,Interesting,I enjoyed the book because it discussed a subject close to my grandfather who lived in Leadville at the time it was built. I would have liked to live there at that time.
4,Fun for about a week,"I was recently at Border's bookstore & this dvd was at the dollar section. I searched to see if it was official <check> was it a game <check> was it convincing enought to buy <check> of course I would buy it for a dollar, but originally it was 20 bucks <YIKES!> 1st thing i did was, I called my friends over made some snacks and put the dvd in. It was fun & everybody said it was cool. But the dvd only has 6 games, all which have different puzzles, but are recycled again & again. Oh well, its just a DVD. After a week it got boring, but in a month I'll have forgotten most of the hard questions, & will have fun once again...Do I recommend it? Sure, just as long you don't get bored easily."
3,Goin' Back To Indiana is not so good,"Lookin' Through The Windows contains good songs, but Goin' Back To Indiana isn't so good with Introes, Medleys..."
5,Stellar,"A wonderful mix of old time favorites and wonderful new songs. One of the most unacknowledged rock 'n roll bands in America, the Radiators pull out all of the stops with this cd. Kudos to the band for 29 years of consistency and innovation. Highly recommended. Lets Radiate!"
3,Disappointing because....,I bought this DVD simply for the appearance of Barbra Streisand. The rest of it is boring.
3,falls apart,I bought this for my 13 mo before going on a short road trip. He really loved it but within just a few months he (less than 2 yrs at the time) ripped off the button board. We do still have it and read it as a regular book.
3,A review on contemporary poety,"""Just Let Me Say This About That"" is a very good read and is in a format not like others. It deals with many of life's big questions and keeps the reader interested in the next question and response. The answers to these questions seem at times philosophical, but after explained by the speaker, seem to ring true.In John Bircuth's ""Just Let Me Say This About That"", he explores what truth is in its core essence and what truth is to different people. The book takes form in a question and answer format and the questioners or reporters are The Bird, The Fish and The Fox. The speaker is either God, The President of the United States, everyone's Father or a combination of all three. Life lessons are explained through situations and circumstances in ""the game"" of life. Everyday occurrences seem to take on a deeper meaning when examined more closely and I found this narrative poem to be fresh and clever."
1,Not sure,I am not sure about this product. I had a heck of a time getting it to install then it did not show me any restored files. I eventually got my files back but I don't think it is from this program. I can't recommend it.
3,Good value indicator for tight places,"While this is obviously not a top quality indicator, its fine for home or light duty shop use. This size indicator is getting to be fairly hard to find and is great for very tight places. I use it for finding TDC when timing my motorcycle as no larger indicator will clear the frame and fuel tank. The only drawback of the indicator is it does not have the reverse numbering on the face which would be nice to have.Sincerely,Steve Britt"
3,Good General Guide,"The Ascendancy Strategy guide is a fun book, and it has a very nice poster of the various different specisis in the game. However, there are also three ""scenerios"" speaking from viewpoints of different alien races as they attempt to gain 'Ascendancy.' I found these to be a bit poorly written, as well as the fact that some things in the guide are just plain wrong.Just something to think about, but it you are a die-hard Ascendancy gamer--like I am--then purchase it."
4,check him out,"one day, i heard early b and instantly fell in love....this guy is funny as hell with some nice old school reggae. i had never heard of him before i happened to stumble across it. and it is definately worth buying..."
1,Terrible!,This movie is horrible. The story is lacking and very predictable. The graphics are less than terrible. The acting is worse. Don't waste your time with this movie. It's 90 minutes of your life you will never get back.
2,"Not Very Complex,","This movie was recommended by my boyfriend . We watched it but it had to freeze every 30 mins for some reason and im not a big fan of movies with chics taking their clothes off every 20 mins , hahaha."
1,BAD,This movie was BADDDDDDD! Im a horror buff and love lots of the old B rated movies;but this one just fell off the grid.It was campy!
1,A real disappointment and piece of junk,"This would have been the 6th Sony DRU burner I've had, but I am SO done with Sonys. Even the older models that worked fine only lasted a year or two. Big waste of money. And now this new DRU 830A won't even read straight out of the box!! It did manage to write to a DVD, but created a half dozen coasters -- which it can't even read itself. This has got to be the biggest piece of crap burner I have ever seen. I am returning it today for a Pioneer. I have one of those already (I own a video business) and the Pioneer has no flaws at all. Sony drives are pure junk. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
2,Finally got it to burn properly,"I have tried a few different brands of media and all but 3 have been an unsuccessful burn. I use mainly Verbatim which IS compatible with this drive. After about 20 unsuccessful burns, the thing magically decided to burn media properly. I'm happy with it now, but my rating won't change for this because you shouldn't have to go through that many discs to ""break in"" a product. It costs an extra $8 for those wasted discs. Next time, it's Lite-On. Their products seem to work out of the box, not a ""break in"" product."
2,I wish I were as happy as the other reviewers.,"I have a Sony Vaio computer, so when my DVD burner died, I figured I'd get a Sony burner to replace it. It was easy to install, but the face plate doesn't line up exactly with the front panel of my tower, so when I have the front panel on the drive won't open. So I have to leave my tower's front panel off. And I've been only haveing about a 50% success rate when burning DVDs. I don't know if this is because it's a dual-layer burner, but I'm still burning single-layer discs or if it's some flaw in the burner. Either way, I'm making a hell of lot more coasters than I made with my previous burner."
4,It's just okay,"I suppose that for the money, this DVD-R is a good deal... but I had just a few minor problems with it. For one, while installing the drive into my computer, I had the hardest time trying to change the different face plates that it comes with. After trying (and others even tried to help me) for around 30 minutes, I finally gave up and left it with the white one, which I knew would look odd in my computer. However, my worries were for naught. When I put the screws in it, I realized that it is sunken about an inch into my computer tower. Oh, how lovely. It look horrible!!! Other than that... it's fine. It works fine and all, I just would have liked a smoother look."
5,Still Beautiful work,"I got to say Julie Bell's work is not my kind of artist but her artwork is outstanding. and I would tell anybody that has an interest in ""Good"" artwork to check her work out too,.."
5,Boris Vallejo And Julie Bell : The Ultimate Collection,"This book is the best to purchase if you are interested in viewing the works of Boris and Julie throughout their entire career to date .It shows the grestest of all and more .Anyone who is a fan this is a must have . Their works are fantastic, covering a wide range of genres and topics .5 stars, a great book .Was this review helpful to you?"
4,"If you are a fan, this book is a must","I've been a fan of Boris Vallejo since the late 70's. He was a major inspiration for me in my own artistic aspirations. Say what you want about his composition or subject matter but you can't deny that he is the undisputed master of his technique. His wife, Julie Bell's style is almost indistinguishable from Vallejo's but she has mastered Boris' painting techniques with enough expert panache to make them her own. Although I wish there was more emphasis on Boris' earlier work, this book is a beautiful compilation of some of Vallejo and Bell's best work. The print quality of some Boris' classic pieces is below par for this type of book, but overall this is a must for longtime fans and newcomers alike."
5,Very full collection!,If you are a Boris Vallejo fan then this is a must for you! I bought it for my Dad for Christmas but will soon be purchasing one for myself after seeing it. Just beautiful!
2,frustration,"This item is useful only if you are able to find a toaster oven that works for it. ANd expect that search to be hard-- long, frustrating, and almost impossible.Then try to mount the hood and connect the toaster oven without adequate instructions. It is again a huge and frustrating task. I had to use a dremel tool to take off two flanges that were in the way and no explanation for their use."
2,Short term love affair......,"I bought this about one year ago (2001, Dec.). I loved it. It was light, and also very easy to operate. However, it broke right after the warranty (2002, Dec.). I had no idea why it broke....I didn't drop it...didn't abuse it.... it just died.So disappointed."
4,it a god thing,i have had it for 1 year and it play good and does not skip and i will be using it for the frist time in my car so i dont no how it will sound but i hop it will sound good
2,No Line Out!,"This was a waste of money. The manual says that the line out can be connected to stereo system, but when I tried it, the sound was terrible. My old player was fine with line out (MZR55), but this one actually has less features."
5,Why is this out of print?!?,"Simply put, one of the most essential products of that space-time-continuum-disturbance known as punk."
4,Why people like these guys...,"Whenever I play my ""Generic"" cd in front of friends, they usually tell me two things; turn it off, and why do you like that music? Most Flipper fans, as myself, understand what we're listening to. Flipper often plays slow, sludgy sounding rock with shouting vocals, all that are obviously lazily done. I've heard teen garage bands play more in tune and in pace than these guys, but that's part of the beauty of Flipper is that they don't give a f#*$. Their guitars may be tuned horribly, but their music is a perfect fit for witty lyrics such as ""Ever feel stupid, and then know that you really are"", as it solidifies Flippers status as dirge-indie-rock Gods. You'll know what you're dealing with after you hear the last line to their first song: ""Well, have you ... ever .. I have, So What""."
1,it's Flipper,"Album - Generic Flipper Well, what's to say, it's Flipper. You're either going to hate them or hate them. Yeah, that's clean."
2,A one-joke band,"Most of Flipper's schtick was based on the simple premise of playing slow in an era (hardcore) when punk bands were playing faster and faster. Which was funny in 1982 -- sort of. But it's not something to base an entire career upon, especially when a band has so little to say musically. ""Ha Ha Ha"" (a single not on this album) was a good song, a couple others (including two or three on here) OK and that's it. Sludgy, tuneless, and unmemorable. Oh, and yes, Kurt Cobain liked these guys, and this album was on a bunch of rock critic geek lists. So what."
2,I'm disappointed.,"I'd always heard Flipper were an amazing band, and that this was their best album. I think ""Ever"" is a really cool song. To me, it encapsulates all the promise of this band. No explanation is necessary as to why Kurdt was such a fan of this band. But the rest of the album really really let me down. Even the much-lauded ""Sex Bomb"" kinda bored me. Its an sax-and-punk Detroit-style jam, but having heard the real-deal Detroit stuff, it just sounds repetitive and kinda ""no fun."" Its not the juvenile sass that I don't like about this band - I was down for that - its that they're just not that great."
5,Sludge Rules,"Crowbar managed to sneak a new album by! I hadn't heard anything at all about their new album until I saw this on the rack. I felt so lucky to just find this by chance on the very day it was released! This album continues the progression that started with Odd Fellows Rest, and continued with Equilibrium. The Lasting Dose, and Awakening stand out immediately. If you're in to HEAVY, HEAVY, Sludge, This album is a can't miss."
5,Interesting book,I downloaded this book on my device and my 14 year old son instantly downloaded it to his kindle and started reading it immediately. I was impressed how it caught and kept his attention. I am a home school teacher and I am happy with the context and historical facts in the book.
3,Nice late night formula vigilante movie.,"""Next of Kin"" is pretty much the standard vigilante movie. Only the actors were changed to protect Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"" (1974) and Sylvester Stallone in ""First Blood"" (1982) from this overplayed formula movie.Truman Gates' (Patrick Swayze) brother has a brand new truck and is selling wholesale cigarettes. He should be shot for that. Oh, he was. Evidently against the advice of his partner the brother decided to protect the cigarettes from hijackers with his life. On the other hand little Joey Rosselini (Adam Baldwin) is showing off and can not back down from the challenge.Now Truman must identify the person whom his brother insulted and incarcerate him. You guest it; the rest of the kin which includes Blair (Liam Neeson) thought you were supposed to ""incinerate"" him. So the fun begins. Bang! Bang! Soot-um up."
4,Great Movie,"Next of Kin is a great movie, Partick Swayze and Liaam Neeson are great actors and their performance was excellent."
3,a hillbilly takes on the big city mob,"The backwoods comes to the big city in this movie:in one scene the older brother is hand loading his ammunition in his hotel room. The youngest brother is killed my a mob sub-boss and sets off the chain of events where a hillbilly cop and his older brotherfind their brother's killer.There is a lot of action and the one hillbilly does a elevated traintop ride that is kind of fantastic.I kind of liked the action here, but a bow and arrow against tommy gunsis just too much contrast?"
5,next of kin one of the best,"Next of kin""s action blasts throught chicago right from the get go. The mob wants to muscle in on a local business but they make two mistskes. They kill a youth whose brother is a cop is truman gates ( patrick swayze ) transplantfrom appalachia's backwoods to chicago's mean streets."
5,For Christmas,"Next Of Kin. I bought it for one of my sons; I have seen it many times, and still love it."
5,Next of Kin,"The movie I received was a good copy, but I thought I chose to buy a new copy for an extra couple of dollars to be safe. I am pretty sure I was charged for a ""New"" copy but when I got it, it was marked used. The difference between the two was only a few dollars but it is just the point that I thought I was paying for a new copy. Otherwise everything else was good with the transaction."
3,next of kin,The price and delivery was a bargain. The movie was recieved and worked properly but the case was damaged.
3,I'LL LEAVE A LIGHT ON FOR THIS MOVIE ANYTIME.,THIS IS PATRICK SWAYZE'S BEST MOVIE. THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS WHEN ALL HIS KIN START GETTING CALLS TO COME AND PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY. THERE'S NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THIS FLICK. IT WOULD MAKE ANY SOUTHERNER PROUD TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
2,Next of Kin Patrick Swayze DVD,Movie is OK if you like Swayze but the format is terrible. Huge black lines down the screen resulting in very small picture.
4,good,very good very good excelent greatWONDERFUL a GOOD MOVIE excelent actor very good scenes excelent quality abcd efg hij klm opq n
3,Will satisfy fans of the leading actors,"Patrick Swaze is the big city cop from the backwoods whose younger brother is shot dead by the mob and he vows to track down those responsible.However,when he takes his brothers body home to be buried,his elder brother,loose cannon Liam Neeson,is disappointed with the lack of direct action;and threatens to become involved.Neeson does become involved with tragic results which brings a variety of strange hillbilly types into the big smoke to extract retribution.Reasonable action thriller,but could have done with more of""the kin""and Michael J Pollard;now approaching the veteran stage;steals every scene he appears in."
3,Way underrated film 7.5/10,I'm going to be reviewing underrated 1989 action Next Of Kin starring Patrick Swayze as Truman Gates Liam Neeson as Brair Gates Andres Catsulas as John Clsabella Helen Hunt as Jessie Gates it has a lot of well known actors & a simple plot Truman Gates brother was killed & he's investigating the murder Brair Gates his older brother comes up from Kentucky to take the law into his own hands this made things a whole lot more interesting. Not much of a review but just really me talking about this movie it has a great cast decent action decent plot its underrated like I said. If you see it in Wal Mart go ahead & buy it I got mine for $5 if you see it on TV which is where I 1st give it a watch if you can't find anything at the Video Store rent it's definitely worth a watch at least once. I would've liked Patrick Swayze to have done more action movies. Sucks this movie doesn't have special features it's just plain bones. Maybe will get a special edition with better PQ.
3,From Back Cover,"After Olivia Lockhart finds her boyfriend and now ex-roommate in a compromising position, she swears off gorgeous men for good. They seem interested in only one thing - and it isn't commitment! But when sexy photographer Justin Hawthorne saunters into her lingerie company's office, she wonders if her decision wasn't just a little too hasty. Could this heartbreaker with a megawatt smile actually be more than she bargained for?Forced to work together on a racy swimsuit shoot, Justin is clueless why exotic Olivia's ice-queen act is directed squarely at him. But he's willing to put his pride on the line if it means getting close enough to melt her steely self-control. He may not be looking for happily-ever-after, but who said a hot little fling couldn't be sheer decadence...?"
3,Tale of a man and a ghost...,"The debt collector, Tsai-Shen, arrives in a small town in order to collect a debt. However, during a massive rainfall the water has destroyed the records of the debt that Ning is suppose to collect. Penniless and friendless Tsai-Shenseeks shelter in the Lan Ro temple oblivious to the reputation of the temple, which is known for its ghosts as well as its deaths. During the night Tsai-Shen meets Hsiao-Tsing with whom he falls in love with, but he is unaware that she is a ghost. Chinese Ghost Story is a touching love story full of swashbuckling adventure and humor as Tsai-Shen ignorantly tumbles through an adventure with horrors around every corner. However, the comedy is not as well balanced with the horror, since the comedy removes the suspense as it often is slap-stick humor. In the end, the audience experiences a action comedy that will entertain and offer some hilarious moments as Tsai-Shen struggles through this adventure."
3,Great movie; what's up with Media Asia's DVDs? Help!,"Has anyone but I had trouble with accessing the Langue section of the Menu on Media Asia DVDs? I returned one, thinking it was defective. However, any DVD I own from Media Asia is the same: It seems as if it's entering the menu and then just ""bounces"" me back to the main menu! The rest of the menus are fine; only the Language is this way. Thanks. Scangemi@ohpny.com"
5,Simply wonderful!,"A chinese ghost story is one of the best chinese ghost movie ever made. It is simply a classic!! it talks about a poor scholar in love with a ghost. the love story is simply lovely!! get this dvd, u will not be disappointed."
1,This movie SUCKS,"I don't get the rave reviews. This is nothing more than a chinese b-movie: poor acting, laughable ""monsters"" & effects, minimum plot.I'm sorry that I bought this DVD, which I did based on the reviews on this sight. Oh well."
1,HAHAHA 100% TRASH MOVIE!!!,"HAHAHAHA!!This is one of the funniest movie I've haver seen! But this is not a good thing. It is 100% trash movie. Its effects are the worst in the movie history. The caracters are stupid. This is garbage. The story is even worst. The worst of all is the Swordsman's mustache. My little brother could do something more real. Really, this is a MUST NOT see. It takes 90 minutes of suffering. It looks like 10 years!!! This one is really terrible... This is a proof that sometimes people can really SCREW EVERYTHING UP. Sucks big time!!!"
1,Don't buy refurb,"NOT Happy with this machine. I bought machine 11/27/09. The dvd player works fine; however, the vcr no longer functions properly. It will play a tape for a few minutes then the machine completely shuts off then ejects the tape. I called in the warranty and it is actually more expensive for service ($69.95) at a local service center than I actually paid for the machine. Now I'm stuck with a piece of crap machine. Thanks a lot."
1,poor product,"The dvd/vcr was difficult at best to setup. And to make matters worse, I was never able to use it to record any dvds. Last but not least, the vcr stopped working after a two month period."
2,Poor customer service of returned DVD Recorder/VCR,"Received Emerson DVD Recorder/VCR in timely matter, but DVD did not work. Returned to DiscountJungle for credit. No e-mails received acknowledging their receipt of product and in turn no credit to my credit card. Called 800 number and left message but no reply. As of today 6/1/08 still have not received credit for purchase."
3,"It works OK, but it's cheap.","I received the first machine. It took about a week to exchange it. It wouldn't turn on...no power at all. No problems with the exchange. The second has to have a tape in it or it makes a loud machine gun sound of loud rapid clicking. I have used it to make at least 20 DVDs from vcr tapes. Can't figure out how to dub more than one tape to one DVD-maybe you can't. It was cheap and did what I wanted it to do. I just couldn't see spending $300 on something that contains a VCR player/recorder in it. It will be obsolete very soon, especially when I convert the last VCR tape to DVD."
4,Magnavox MWR20V6 DVD Recorder / VCR Combo,"Won't play REALLY old tapes, but does great otherwise! For the price it is the best!"
3,Magnavox MWR20V6 DVD Recorder / VCR Combo,"I received it in good time and though the manual power button on the front of the machine does not work, it seems the remainder works with the remote control. I am still testing out the entire system, but so far there have been no other problems with it."
1,very poor,"this item has a poorly built bult vcr, which when it misbehaves the dvd recorder will not workthe player will automatically shut off in the middle of a recording"
1,Gaming Spot,"I've already given a review from my purchase of the piece of junk from the""Gaming Spot"".If the ""Gaming Spot"" wants to credit my account first(around $70) ...$69.98 to be exact-for the piece of junk+shipping that I spent,fine.Trust works both ways.I trusted them in the 1st place,but they mislead me about their claims of the product+will probably continue to do the same with other consumers"
5,why the bare bones version,"I had been searching for this dvd for about 3 years now and had no luck as it was out of print. Then finally I found it and at only 9.99 But then again this is Universal were talking bout here, so why have such a goregous movie and do a bare bones version. There was no menu what so ever and nothing extra at all. I would be willing to pay more for a special edition. The movie itself wal extra sharp looking and the audio was outstanding the big plus is that it was wide screen. Universal people dont care for cheap dvds when they are bare boned versions"
3,"Awesome love story, Absurd sex scenes","Undoubtedly I would give this film 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it contains THE most ridiculous sex scenes that have ever been shown in a movie. It's definitely not for kids to see! I first saw this on TV and fell in love with the story, so I bought the DVD so there'd be no commercials. That was a big mistake. I'm no prude, but I can't even stand to watch those parts."
5,one of my favourites,This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. A feel good movie that is one of the best around. I love it.
4,White Palace,I like both actors featured in this movie.Had seen it years ago and remembered it.I think it is a good love story.A bit predictable but well worth watching.
5,This is one hot flick!,"This is a great movie. It has an interesting story, hot action, and it flows well. The best thing about it though is that my wife loves it, and she always feels romantic after watching it. It's worth buying for that reason alone."
4,Love and Courage&#65533; Touching and Honest,"The author shows real talent and courage in this true story about and by a birthmother who found her two children later in life. This bittersweet, honest, and touching tale is a poignant read for anyone who has ever dealt with adoption... either as a parent, or a child"
3,Comfortable But Old Fashioned,"These shoes are very comfortable, but not stylish at all. They are good for running out to the grocery store or CVS, but I would not wear them for going out with friends. Definitely not a dinner companion."
3,Delighted,"I was delighted to find this book. It has a few crayon scribbles in it, but that is ok. I read this book to my granddaughter so many times and now she is 32 and expecting her own, so the tradition will continue. There were 2 books she had mentioned that she wished she had saved - Forest Hotel and A Day At The Beach. Thanks to Amazon I found both of them and she will be so surprised when she opens them at our family reunion in a couple of weeks."
3,Does not hold up well,"This farce creates characters which are too easy to lampoon, and has few moments of real humor. Good idea for a movie, but a lot of dragging parts, not well realized, and doesn't hold up well over the years. Furthermore, it's obvious that recurring comedy elements draped with fanciful music borrow heavily from Woody Allen's ""Bananas"". Not a classic. Sky above and mud below throw-in is a snoozer."
5,Rockin' folk with a huge heart !,"Droge presents his musical narratives of love and loss, personal loneliness on the road, a best friends suicide and other matters of the heart in a spirited, richly textured manner. A Pacific Northwest artist deserving of a much wider audience."
4,An excellent unsung record in the vein of Tom Petty's best,"If you like Wilco, Matthew Sweet, or Tom Petty, you'll love this wonderfully diverse album by a guy who should be getting much more justice."
5,Debi does it again!!!,"Wow what a triumph, frugal living for dummies delivers common sense ideas that everyone could employ in their own lives.It allows you to pick and choose the bits that suit your situation and bypass any that are not applicable to your own circumstances,thus giving a flexible approach to the idea of saving money whilst living life to the full, without a sense of restriction or a feeling of doing without.The book takes you step by step through the mine field of eliminating credit card debt and the like to show us a new life without the constant worry of mounting obligations that can not be met each month.For me this was truly an inspiring read and in my opinion worthy of a place on anyone's book shelf who wants to be free of the constraints of monthly out goings which exceed their income.Remember a tight budget does not mean living without any luxuriesjust prioritising the money available to be able to live life to the full within your own means."
5,Frugal Living means Smart Living,"Frugal Living for Dummies is NOT a good title. No one in today's economy is a 'Dummy' for trying to live frugal! This book gives hundreds of great, easy to follow tips for living better on less in the ""for Dummies"" format. A very good read...especially in tough financial times."
3,Great for those new to the lifestyle,"If you're new to frugal living then I'm sure this book will be of great help to you. I've been living a frugal lifestyle for a few years now and was hoping I might get a few new suggestions by reading this book but unfortunately I was wrong. I would recommend this book to those who are interested in saving a bit here and there. Frugality doesn't mean that you need to move to a teeny tiny apartment, clip coupons and eat rice for every meal. If you're looking to get out of debt or maybe try to simplify your way of living, this book would be a great start."
3,Basic but good,"This is a very good basic book for beginners with families. It will give the first time frugal adventurer a chance to dip the toe in to get started.If you are looking for more advanced ideas, generally the Dummies series will not satisfy.Do a quick ""Look Inside the Book"" to see if this touches on the areas you feel are important. For many this book just might be enough as a good starting point to allow a beginner to start thinking differently about their personal finances.Frugal Matters"
2,"Disappointed Dummy, Deborah!","As a veteran of the simple/frugal living movement, I pre-ordered this book in hopes that it would be chockful of fabulous new ideas! NOT! I was so disappointed because there is not one new or original idea in the entire book. It's just a compilation of common-sense money-saving ideas.If you have never read a book on frugal or simple living, this book may be just what you need. It is a compilation of all the common shared knowledge for frugal living. If you have read about or researched or even jus thought about frugal and simple living, this book will be extremely boring. There was literally not one item in this book that I had not heard or thought of myself before."
1,This is a stupid book,"This book has ideas such as play a board game with your family instead of going out, cancel cable, do anything that is free, not frugal, and then has the gall to give you tips on eating at a fancy restaurant (go during off hours). There is a difference between being frugal and being a MISER! That is why they call it miser. Being Frugal is a state in which one is conscious of his/her expenses and gets the best quality that their money can buy, be it Target or Saks, because of the longterm investment. This book is about either not having any money in the first place and having to survive, or having a whole bunch of money but wanting to take it with you. It describes no method, nor does it give any kind of roadmap to where frugal living will get you. It should either be called ""For Dummiest dummies"" or ""Existing for Dummies."" If you do not believe me, go to the library and borrow it."
5,Perfect intro to frugality basics,"I turn to Dummies books when I want a lighthearted, basic intro to topics I know nothing about. Like other Dummies books, Frugal Living for Dummies is written for beginners, for newbies, for people not afraid to laugh at themselves or jokingly admit they are sort of a dummy when it comes to the subject matter of the book. This book is not directed at an audience of black-belt frugal folk. It is a humorous, basic intro for people new to the practical steps of living well on limited means. If you have never worried about tightening your budget belt before but have unexpectedly found yourself drowning in one of these scenarios (losing a job, deciding to have a stay-at-home parent, recovering from exessive debt, struggling to survive after a messy divorce), then this book would probably be the perfect life-line. I think it would also make a good gift from a frugal person to their spendthrift friends. It is arranged in topical, easy-to-use chapters."
2,"Unless you are clueless about being frugal, don't bother","I learned very little new information from the book. All it did is to confirm that I am frugal about most of my money spending decisions.. and I am not that frugal! The best price diary was the one helpful thing I am walking away with. But little else was new. On a positive note, I did enjoy reading the chapters about saving on groceries, but I am not sure how helpful the infromation will be considering I knew most of it and what I did and did not do to save money was a conscious decision on my part based on taste and convenience."
2,Okay for free,"No line breaks, no bookmark for the table of contents. The text is there, but if you can about things like stanzas you should get another edition."
4,Excellent quality,This product arrived in a very quickly after ordering. It was well packaged and in perfect condition. I was very happy with the quality of the fabric and stitching and it was well-worth the price! It was a gift for a relative who lives in Utah and he was delighted with it.
2,"Amazon disapoints, item not as title describes","I have shopped on Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I have been disappointed. I ordered what I thought was a BOYS size medium hoodie, but upon arrival it is a MEN's medium; not what I was expecting at all based on the item title. That said, it is an amazingly well made product and feels very warm. Amazon needs to do something about the title of this item since a Men's medium will not fit my 12 year old and now I have the hassle of returning it."
2,Sent wrong size,"Company Under Armour "" Ua"" sent the wrong size. Problem is I have to pay the postage to. Return it"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this hoodie in the hopes of wearing it on my trip to colorado for christmas. There was a couple of things that disappointed me about the item: 1) the claim was that it was true to size, meaning that someone like myself with a 42 inch chest should order a large, FALSE! should have ordered a medium. 2) the lining on the inside of this particular color (true gray heather) is different in texture and weight than all the other colors in this and other model hoodies that under armour carries. I verified this by going to a local store which carries a full line of the brand. This particular hoodie was not warm at all. It may be that this hoodie is specifically for excercising or that the looseness of the fit allowed too much cold tho come in. Either way I was very disappointed with the hoodie and gave it to my brother.On a positive note the hoodie was very nice looking, and had it fit me I would have definately kept it."
4,that's clean Flipper,"Well, what's to say, it's Flipper. You're either going to hate them or hate them. Yeah, that's clean."
2,"Great range, but alway loses sync with the antenna","The only reason i bought two of these is because of the great range. I thought it would be the perfect solution in a large presentation room.But guess what, every time I reboot the PC the USB Antenna some how loses sync with the keyboard, mouse and remote. Every time. I have replaced the batteries, I have put the keyboard and mouse and remote right next to the antenna during boot up, and still nothing. I have to keep a paper clip next to the PC to re-sync all three devices. I have tried the other USB Ports on the computer to see if that can make a difference, but nope. It's still the same.Oh it's not just this one. I have another presentation room on the other side of the building, and it does the same thing."
2,Not too good,"I use the mouse and keyboard less than 8 feet from the CPU. The mouse batteries wear out quickly. I had to replace the batteries after only about 10 days of use, and I only used it about 1 hour per day. I've also had to replace the keyboard batteries after less than 2 weeks of use. The keyboard loses communication with the computer occasionally. The only way to resync it is to remove the keyboard's batteries, wait a minute, and then reinstall the batteries. Only about 90 percent of your key presses are recognized, so you'll spend a lot of time using backspace to reenter lost characters. There is a slight delay between keyboard and computer too. Given those problems, when it works it works pretty well, but can be really frustrating, especially when you remember that you dropped almost $80 for it."
3,"Great pianist, so-so voice","It is lovely to have the complete songs all on one CD. The late James Barbagallo accompanies with great skill. I might like a little more prominince at times, but he has the technique to do wonders. (He also has 4 CDs of piano music. He unfortunately died in his 40s just when he was to make more recordings.)Stephen Tharp is not such a great find. His voice is serviceable. He takes a few songs in a higher key. The problem is that certain portions of his voice sound labored,needing a higher, brighter vowel. His legato is at times too much, because we just don't get words. Thomas Hampson has recorded Opus 11 and 12, and the difference is incredible.Mr. Tharp tries hard, but his tone is not ingratiating. Still, for most of this music, you have no alternative. So buy it and enjoy it for what it is. It's just too bad Naxos couldn't have found a better choice."
2,"Tepid music, tepid performances","I'm sorry to have to say it, but this recording contains music that is undistinguished in performances that are competent only. The music is Grieg-and-water. The American tenor's voice is light-weight and charmless. The pianist is excellent. You can't beat the price, though, if you really want to hear this repertoire."
4,Turkey Johnson,"I knew the author and several people in his life. He had a turkey farm near me when I lived in Pennsylvania, and several times provided turkeys for the White House over Thanksgiving. He began a summer season restuaant in Delaware and had a summer cottage next door to me. Turkey dinners were a specialty, as he would fly the turkeys (in his airplane) to Delaware for fresh turkeys for the restuarant. Very folksy book !"
2,Disappointed,"I am so excited about being the Mother of the Groom for the first and only time in my life. I immediately ordered this book in the hopes of doing everything right. We are in different states and I want to be involved as much as possible without interfering. This book mentions the fact that mother and son could be in different states, but gives no useful advice as to how she can be of assistance in that regard. It also seemed that many of the scenarios and suggestions were not necessarily things that the mother of the groom would be responsible for. It seemed that according to this book she is involved in everything. It also made it sound as if every bride is a Bridezilla and that is certainly not the case in our wedding, nor is the mother of the bride disagreeable. I would pass on this one. I am going to try to find something that ""hits the mark""."
3,95% of content is for mothers of the bride,"This book is pretty basic and could definitely be a book for mothers of the bride. It is all the typical information that books for mothers of the bride would contain. I haven't read any of the author's other books, but I feel certain that this information was just cut and pasted from a book for brides or mothers of the bride.There is very little information specifically for mothers of the groom. I especially wanted information on rehearsal dinners (creative ideas, do's and don't's, proper etiquette, etc.), but there was not a whole lot of information on the subject. I should have returned the book but waited too long."
1,Not so helpful,"I did not find this book to be very helpful. I was looking for specific information about the etiquette for hosting a rehearsal dinner, my expected contributions for the wedding etc. etc. I did not find it in this book. Consequently, I will head to the library to get the information I need."
5,Mother of the Groom,"Everything, from pre-planning to the wedding weekend, is included in this book. It's an easy read and a great resource."
2,"choose wisely, Weedhopper","This book would be an excellent resource for anyone interested in pursuing a very conventional kind of participation in her son's wedding. I am not, so it has limited information that will be useful to me."
3,Just OK,"I read all of th1s book to help prepare for my son's wedding. I don't think I really learned anything important. To a big extent, this is geared more at people that want a big lavish wedding and don't mind spending big bucks. Second, apparently there really aren't any real rules any more, just go with the flow."
2,Too Old Fashioned,"What a disappointing book! It is too old fashioned and out of date. I was hoping for an updated guide that helped the groom's mother deal with issues in the real world, not the world of the 1950s."
3,Just another MOG book,"After reading online reviews, I purchased MOG: Everything You Need to Know to Enjoy the Best Wedding Ever. A complete reading did not provide the type of information I was expecting. The book appears to be a 'cut & paste' version of a MOB's planning guide."
1,not all it is cracked up to be,Can't say I learned anything that anyone with any common sense wouldn't know. Not worth spending any money on.
3,Mr & Mrs Country Music For The Record,"By the time they stepped into the CBS recording studio in 1971 George and Tammy had been married two years, he was already considered one of the great traditional artists in the genre and she was the industry's First Lady. They were sitting on top of the country music world. The downhill slide was only a few years away, but for a brief time they were country music's camelot ... they were the original ""Mr. & Mrs. Country Music"". Only a few of their duets went number one (GOLDEN RING, WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON) and some seemed to miss the mark all together (THE CEREMONY, A PAIR OF OLD SNEAKERS), but the simple joining of two of country music's most famous voices makes this BIGGEST HITS collection a haunting, biographical journey into the country music of yesterday that shouldn't be forgotten nor missed."
1,16 Biggest Hits George Jones,16 Biggest Hits by George Jones & Tammy Wynette. does not have any songs by Tammy alone. Too much George Jones
4,REMINDS ME OF MY CHILDHOOH,"Johnny sounds just as he did when we use to sit around the radio listening to other country greats. "" Battle of New Orleans"","" Johnny Reb"" & ""Don't Sink the Bismark"" and let's not forget ""Whispering Pines"". All country lovers should that the time to listen, young and old."
2,MP3 Download,The album is great but only had 11 of the 16day Greatest Hits download. The site was difficult to maneuver through.
5,Purchased the CD,I have always loved Johnny Horton and love this CD.It has his greatest hits. I love Whispering Pinesand North to Alaska.
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"The transition from cassette to CD was easy with this one. I grew up listening to Johnny Horton, even singing the songs at night with my father before bed. A great storyteller and singer. This CD will not disappoint any fan."
3,"Great, But Incomplete","This book is beautifully written by a woman who discovers that her cochlear implant has changed her life. It has many inspiring passages and, if you already have a CI, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you read this.However, CIs are not always so successful and, at times, are a complete flop. That is not portrayed at all and I think that many people considering a CI or who have a family member considering a CI read this book as a way to see what will happen to them next. That is unrealistic. It isn't healthy to assume that one person's results from this operation are what will happen to everyone. Of course, her experience will be had by many.....just not all. This is coming from a cochlear implant recipient who not only didn't get any success, but regrets greatly that it was performed.Looking for inspiration? This book can provide that. Looking for an unbiased idea of what a cochlear implantee can expect? Definitely NOT a good option. Just this deafie's opinion."
5,This is a must read for Cochlear implant people,"although this is an older interpretation of the now newer cochlear implant system available, it is relevant to my implant in 2009 - every tiny sound and experience is mirrored in my experiences of my implant even though it about an early model they got it right back then I fell in love with this book I can still open any page and say - yep! thats what I heard and how I felt - even if I wrote it myself I would need to change nothing as it tells you what it like both Deaf and to return to normal life"
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!,I bought this for my little sister's 4th baby shower we had this past weekend and everybody aahhed and oohhed over it! They all loved it and all asked me where I got it. It is so cute!
2,small little cloth set,"I was very upset when i received this purchase it is soooooooooooooo small and i think i was deceived especially with the sheep, they make it look like a decent size but it is as small as a chew toy and now i have to buy something else to give along with this gift. This was not worth the money i spent.=("
5,Baby Sleep Sheep,I bought this item as a gift and it is precious. I wasn't familiar with the product line and will definitely be looking for more of the Cloud b Baby items.
3,Disappointed,"I had just received my package in the mail... Expecting exactly what the photograph was.The only issues I have with these items are that, The ""Baby Rattle"" is the size of a small, extremely minute chew toy I would give to my dog to play with in its spare time, let alone give to my newborn baby. In the photograph the rattle appears to be decent size, when in reality its smaller than my hand. The spill cloths are decent but this is nothing I would willing pay for again knowing the outcome. Seeing as the total was though only 15$ and some change.. Next time I plan on just spending the extra money and ordering from the Cloud B official website. I ordered something from there official website before and was very pleased with the outcome... This mistake, will not happen again."
5,Sheep Rattle and Spill Cloths,The soft and quiet rattle helps my 5 month old sleep every night. She loves to touch it as she falls asleep. The spill cloths are top quality for absorbtion.
5,Gift Recipient Loved It!,"I purchased this for an expectant 28 year old mom & dad, who loved it. They have already begun using it - playing the sounds to her stomach! Hopefully the baby will also love it, but the parents were thrilled! I felt like a smart and thoughtful gift-giver when I heard the response to this sheep!"
3,Millefiori Watch,There was a hairline flaw that you can see if you look very carefully at the watch. Otherwise it was a nice watch.
3,Disappointed,"I ordered these for my wife's birthday, but she says last year's flowers were way better.Although the flowers come with a vase, they were shipped in a box. My wife had to arrange her own flowers when they were delivered.She also tells me that there's only one type of flower in her bouquet (irises). The ""florist designed"" bouquet must have been designed by a florist who was lacking time and creativity.Overall, she was much more pleased with the flowers I bought her last year at 1800flowers.com."
5,love it!,"Bought these mats for my cowgirl daughter. She drives to the barn everyday so they get alot of use,they are durable and a good value for the money. The heavy duty rubber makes them easy to hose off. She loves them."
4,Exactly what I expected,They look just like the picture and are half way heavy duty floor mats. We did not have to trim them so no troubles there. My mom LOVES them - they were her birthday present!!!
1,dissapointed,This is just a short screenplay of the movie and not really a memoir. Rent the excellent movie.
5,Brad Strickland's First and Best.,"Out of all of the six Bellairs/Strickland books published thus far, ""The Hand of the Necromancer"" still remains the best. Even though Brad Strickland was bold to say the least with this one, he managed to pull off an excellent story line and introduce a new character to boot while still including all of the original Bellairs magic and charm.The dust jacket design by Edward Gorey is one of the best - the hand and globe on the front immediately tell an important part of the story without even having to open the book, and the illustration on the back of Johnny, the Professor and Sarah at the park with Mattheus Mergal in the background brandishing his staff is marvelously done. We will sourly miss you, Mr. Gorey!If you decide to read any of the Bellairs/Strickland books, make this one the first title you pick up. It'll set a good mood for the next five. Also check out the other four titles written by John Bellairs and completed by Strickland..."
3,"Good, but not as good as Bellairs...","Strickland does have a good sense of Bellairs' style, and yet he doesn't. He has a need to make Johnny's life happier in each book, which really does nothing for the stories. Also, the villians and plots get a little hokier each time. Bellairs' stories were all DARK. He had no need to make it seem less believable or gorey just to make the reader sleep better at night. The story was good, though. The whole idea of cursed artifacts and an evil man on the hunt for them was cool, although I prefer Fergie to Sarah anyday. Also, the characters seem to be changing...Higgie is not as dark, the Prof is trying to quit smoking and Johnny...well, no one can totally become Bellairs and Strickland does do a pretty good job of emulating his style. It's worth a read and if you love the characters, and you'll be happy to see them out adventuring again. Oh yeah, bring back Gorey's cover art!"
4,a good find,"this is the kind of book i really engoy because of the good writing style and plot. i enjoyed this book because of the idea of the nacromancer. if you enjoy this type of book i recomend reading ""Sabriel"" by Garth nix and his other books too."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Yes, these designs *are* lovely, unfortunately, they are also riddled with errors. Errata or contact information? Nope. Not available. I can and do design my own knits, however, when I purchase a book of patterns I expect to be able to knit from it without spending hours re-writing the patterns. Having wasted more than enough expensive *luxury* yarn on this book from a designer who can't be bothered to adequately check her patterns for accuracy, I've dumped my copy in the trash and I certainly wouldn't recommend that anyone purchaes this book."
3,Can u hear me now?,I had the latest headset from Moto with the mike boom and loved it. But for now reason the mike quit working. But for a year it was a blessing this 4th generation HS850 worked perfect. THIS one I bought because of the price $30 and figured it would suffice. It has a better fit and audio but it's temperamental and having to turn it on and off is clumsy. I'm using a Moto V330 cell. I gave it 3 stars because not having wires is such a relief and it fits so well.
1,Lasted one month.,"I am very careful with all my electronic toys. My PSP and Black iPOD video have not one scratch! This little thing felt like it was made out of hollow plastic. It might as well have been. The light slowly got dimmer and dimmer as I charged it and then it just died. I am going to try to see if I could return it somehow but I'm sure if it's even possible, it's going to be a huge hassle. *Sigh. Teaches me to purchase things in a store I can actually drive to in order to exchange items."
2,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray,"This headset came in on-time. Lightweight enough, but didn't feel substantial enough to me. Connected it to a Motorola Cliq running Gingerbread, but the connection wasn't too strong and my conversations were difficult to maintain. Rather than bother with shipping it back, we're passing it around the family to see who can get good use of it. Price was reasonable... going with Plantronics HD next time..."
1,Motorola HS 820,Piece of junk. I ordered it to replace an H730 my son broke and I have regreted it since then. I had to reorder a new H730 which fits the bill. The HS 820 for some reason stop functioning shortly after I purchased it and I still have it and do not know what to do with it. Let me know if their is something I can do to return it since it only lasted a few months.
3,Disconnected from Sony Ericsson far too often,"For $7 after Cingular/Amazon rebate, I picked up one of these each for myself and my wife and returned the $60 Jabra headset that I had bought from BestBuy a few weeks earlier. You get what you pay for. The motorola headsets would frequently disconnect from our Sony Ericsson phones for no good reason and were less comfortable to wear than the Jabra. Range and sound were good though, and maybe they work better with other bluetooth phones. Now that my wife managed to lose both of them (good thing they only cost me $14), I'm happy to be back to a Jabra headset (which was free after rebate from a CompUSA promotion). Bottom line, let the price decide which headset to buy, and if you wait and bargain hunt, there's usually a way to score a bluetooth headset for under $20 about once a week."
4,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray,It is very convenient and good for avioding cell phone tickets
1,Broke within 30 days,I used it with my Treo 650 and it broke in the 1st 30 days. It may be a good product. I just got a dud. The range and sound quality where pretty acceptable. I could go into another room and it still worked fine.
4,Almost perfect,"I purchased this headset for use with a Mac PowerBook G4, for use with programs like Skype as well as for use with my cell phone. It works great with my phone. Easy to use and never a problem. I have still never been able to use it with the PowerBook. It could be user error, but I eventually just gave up on pairing it with the machine."
3,"Good cost, poor outgoing sound.","This was the first bluetooth headset I've tried with my Treo 650. I read a lot of reviews and decided to go for it. It paired well with the Treo. It lasted a long time for me on one charge. My two complaints about it are that it didn't feel too steady on my ear, but this wasn't a big deal as I was using this when I was sitting at my desk or in my car, not while I was walking around. The very big complaint was that outgoing sound quality was TERRIBLE. If I was anywhere but a quiet room, people would tell me that they could hardly hear me. I sometimes had to take the earpiece off and speak into it like a mic or shout. I would not recommend this headset."
2,Too Quiet...Design Issue,I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised. I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume. Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise. I found it only adequate in a quiet room. I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal. I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car. It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.
5,I love it,This is my first Bluetooth headset and I really like. I bought it to go with my T-Mobile RAZR and have no complaints. I drive a Sebring Convertible and I can still use the device while driving around town with the top down. My only complaint is that it is so light weight that I forget about it and walk into places with it on my ear.
3,One drawback,"I had great luck on my end with it, but others often had a hard time hearing me when I used it. It does not lend itself to a quiet conversation in an area where you don't want to talk too loud. I changed to the Motorola HS810 (now the HS850) with the longer boom for the mike and the problem went away. All of them (820, 810, and 850) could stand more volume from the earpiece. I usually have to hold them against my head in areas that are not absolutely quiet."
3,Get the HS850 instead,"This was comfortable and I could hear OK, but I had a hard time telling if it was on or off when it was on my ear. I need to be able to answer calls while driving, and this often didn't work. Also, after a year of use, mine wouldn't hold enough of a charge to last through even a short call. I replaced it with the HS850 and that's a huge improvement - I use it all the time now. Using the boom to turn it on makes it so much easier - and it has yet to die in mid conversation. The Amazon price isn't that much more than the HS820, and the difference is worth it."
2,"""Disposable bluetooth headset""","At first is was a good headset for the price. Also easy to use, lightweight and comfortable.The bigest flaws of all is the battery life.After 8 months of use it began to have communications problems with the phone. Then I realized that I had to charge twice a day the headset.One month later it completely died.Finally I concluded that this is a disposable headset because if the battery can't be changed so you have to buy one every nine months.What are you suppose to do with the headset when it dies? to throw it away?A waste of money and pollution to the planet."
3,Earpiece set works well,My expectations I guess are too high. I didn't feel like the battery life was very long in between uses. But it does work well.
3,Severly Medocer,"The head set is what it advertises to be, a bluetooth head set. However the issue of sub standard volue and the way it seems to simply hang on the ear instead of fitting securely have both made me reconsider my purchase. For the price (under $50) you realy cant go wrong and unless you are looking to spend the money for a better one by all means please do not go cheaper."
3,Motorola Bluetooth HS820,"I was excited about receiving this handsfree earpiece for use with my new Blackberry 7100. But after I charged the battery and followed the directions, I found the volume very weak!!! I could barely hear the phone call. It will be returned."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM -- Quality Lacking,"While the price is very good, you can get more for your dollar with other models. I previously used a sony-ericcson headset, but this headset is like talking on a speakerphone. The headset is so light that it won't stay on your ear well. The speaker on the headset is not loud enough to hear in noisy environments. Don't be tempted by the price!"
1,Only the price is right. You get what you pay for.,"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a design defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use."
3,Short delay in connection and bit fragile,I had to return the unit after it fell off of my ear and it stopped working. Amazon.com replaced it in a prompt manner.There is also a short delay to connection when you answer your phone using this Bluetooth unit.
3,works but too big and volume and reception is not great,"This device paired easily with my Motorola cell phone and also with my Gigabyte bluetooth USB device for my computer. However, the headset is too big for my ear so doesn't fit snugly. It tends to move around a lot and I'm afraid it will fall off. The first one I had had the microphone die within the first couple of days, so this is not a very resistant device. Also, when the volume in my ear is very loud and I turn the sound down, the person on the other end can't hear me anymore. Needs two separate volume controls, one for speaker and one for the ear. Overall, I'm not impressed. I am looking for a replacement."
4,Not bad,"The sound is good. But it is not perfect for everybody. It is good for my husband to wear on his ear, but not good for me. I guess because my ear is smaller? ... Except this, it is good."
4,Motorola HS820 bluetooth headset,I really like this set becaues it allows me to use my cellphone safely while driving .
1,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset-Hematite Gray,I have not received this product yet and I am wondering where it is. I also have not received an e-mail telling me what happened to it.
1,I would like to know the charger information,"i am living in Australia, and the voltage in Australia is 240 not like USA 110, therefore can this product's charger using in Australia ? thank you for anyone who can help!!"
5,Voices in my head,"The only bad thing about the HS820 is that people think I'm nuts and talking to myself unless they happen to see the headset. On the plus side, I can just put the thing on and have all the conversations I want with the other voices in my head and people stop thinking I'm nuts as soon as they see the headset.Seriously this device works quite well with my phone (Motorola V330) and if you really need to drive and talk at the same time it's a hell of a lot safer than juggling a phone. It really isn't much different than having a conversation with someone else in the car."
2,Stopped working after 8 months,"It worked great while it lasted. One day though it stopped working. The blue light came on and stayed on as long as there was charge in it, and I couldn't get anything to connect to it or it to respond to any button presses. My wife and I got free cheapo Jabbra headsets when we bought our phones. I lost mine and got this as a replacement. This died in 8 months. My wife's cheapo Jabbra has lasted over 2 years."
3,Works but can be hard to hear,"Since there is no rubber to ""gasket"" your ear, noisy environments can make it hard to hear. i.e. in you car."
4,Ok,I know alot of people with this product and it work pretty good for them so i bought one.. I have no complaints. Plus it was shipped and received and a timely fashion...
3,Works well for the price.,"This is my first bluetooth headset so I don't have much frame of reference. I absolutely love the hands free functionality and that's the main reason I bought one. The advertised 30 foot range is the main gripe I have because real range, before you hear a lot of static, is more like 10-12 feet. Go beyond and you'll either drop the call or can't have a conversation because of the static.Lastly, the unit has dropped calls randomly on occassion for unknown reasons. It can be annoying, but I figure the convenience outweighs the cons.The sound quality isn't great, but it's better than some wired headsets I have used in the past. Bottom line, works well for the price."
2,poor audio quality,"the design is great, the comfort fine, but the whole reason you buy this is so you can use it! cranking up the volume enough so you can hear causes the person you are speaking to on the other end to hear an echo of their own voice coming back to them. i have tried fiddling with the phone volume, a new motorola clamshell, with no luck. the verizon guy in the mall kiosk had no soution either. in fairness, i know other people who like it fine but it has been a dissapointment to me."
4,Pleased with the HS820,I was in need of a Bluetooth Headset to use with my computer. After researching on-line reviews of several headsets I purchased the Motorola HS820 and am glad I did. I found the ear piece comfortable and was pleasantly suprised at my callers response to the microphone pick-up. I've had no problem with the battery life. I'd recommend it.
4,I'm glad I got one,I get an upgrade on my cell phone about every two years. I got a phone that was able to use a bluetooth. I loved the idea to have a headset without a a cord. I looked around and found the hs820. I am glad I got this. It was easy to set up. I used it in my car mostly. For the price I could not pass it up. There is really only one thing about the hs820 that could be better is that the volume could get a little louder.On a busy road outside it becomes hard to hear. I think that's becauce it doesn't set in your ear like some other ear pieces . But over all I'm ver happy with the purchase.
1,"Never worked, and Tigerdirect couldn't care less.","The headset was not in the original Motorola package. That would have been ok, if the headset worked! I called Motorola and they agreed that it was defective and gave me a case # so i could return it to Tigerdirect. The lady I spoke with at Tigerdirect was very unprofessional, and acted like I was bothering her by calling. She did not care what was wrong, or why I was calling. She also seemed to care even less when she noticed that I purchased this through Amazon, and not directly from them. I was going to get an exchange with them, but after that experience I'm just returning it and spending my money elsewhere."
2,"Junk, barely usable","Using one button for on/off, answer, redial etc. without a way to configure it means that people are often getting accidental calls from me. The volume is not nearly adequate to hear in a car. Comfort is poor."
4,"not perfect, but pretty good","It is not the ""greatest"" The sounds works fine on most calls. it is not very good on call overseas. people don't hear very well. However, I am mostly satisfied with it."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. This is a piece of junk. It sounds like a transistor radio. If you are driving in a car, it is almost impossible to hear. I recommend Motorola H720. If not this, anything else other than this one."
3,old design,"At the time I ordered this I noticed a little message from Amazon that I had ordered it in the past...Yep, sure enough when it arrived I realized it was the first one I ever ordered...it comes with its own charging plug that is for it specifically...later versions of it had the little mini plug that all Motorola products have/had. I sent it back as I wanted a newer design. Ordered the Motorola H17Motorola H17 Bluetooth Headset (Black)and love it...see my review of it...This was a great Bluetooth in its day but there are better products out there now."
3,Does what its suppose to.,"When I use the headset, I have a hard time hearing the person on the other line, as well as the other way around. However I only use this in the car, so I can talk as loud as I want. If I were to have bought this for all day use, I would not be happy with it = /"
4,"Good product, but less battery life",the product is great but it would have been better if the battery lasts a little longer and a usb charger.
1,Broken after three months,"I loved the HS820 when I first got it, but after about two months it was no longer discoverable by either of my Motorola V600 telephones. After spending 45 minutes on the phone with Motorola technical support, trying to make them understand that the device simply wasn't being discovered, I was told that there was nothing they could do. I wanted to like this headset, but sadly it's just a piece of junk."
4,Good,This is a very affordable bluetooth headset while we wait for the prices to start dropping. There are a couple problems. The first its hard to hook up if you have no idea what your doing. I brought it to a cingular store and they hooked it up in a second. The second problem is knowing how much power it has and when its going to die off. there really isn't any solution from my knowledge that can fix this but I don't really need this headset I just wanted it for home use.
3,Compatible with Sprint LG LX350,"This bluetooth was the first bluetooth that I ever purchased. I actually purchased this bluetooth twice. The first time I purchased this product from Amazon it was great. I was shipped from Amazon. I didn't have any problems with the echo, noise or any such type. I no longer had this product because it dropped on the street and no longer worked. I came back to Amazon to purchase this product again which it was shipped from A1 Accessories. Now it was the same product and actually came in the actual Motorola box. This time the product did not acutally work well. The other party on the other end would tell me sounds like I am far away and also heard a echo. I don't think I'll buy another bluetooth. I'll just use me speaker on my phone. I am unsure what other bluetooth would work."
2,Not too great!,"I had high hopes for this product, but the simple fact is the reception is not good. I have to stay very close to the phone if I want decent reception. It works best inside a vehicle with the windows closed. The audio level seems pretty low. I can't recommend this."
3,Light but volume is low and sometimes has static,I don't know if static and low volume are general problmes to all the bluetooth headsets. But some of my friends who I was on the phone with complained about it. I never used it while I drove but I suspect those problems will be bigger when I use it in the car.
2,Sweet little toy,"Unlike others, there are no volume problems experinced on the receiving end. Once a friend had trouble hearing me, but only once, out of many calls. While I haven't used it outside a ten foot range I haven't had any drops. Wolume is easily adjustable. Initially, I thought I had connectivity problems, but realized that when you are connecting to the phone you hold the button only so long as it takes for the light to flash once. I had been holding the button too long. All in all I am quite pleased and if I could change the number of stars I initially gave to 5, I would."
2,Unsatisfied,"The quality of this product is poor. I get people saying that they hear noise in the background, as if I was under water."
3,Lots of static,Not that great. Very difficult to hear at times especially if others are taking around you. Lots of static when in use
4,Well worth the money!,I purchased 2 of these headsets. They were very affordable and I'm pleased with their performance. I really like the studiness of the reversible ear piece and the ease of set-up and operation.
4,This does the trick!,"I read the reviews for many different bluetooth series & brands before purchasing & none seemed overwhelmingly better than another. This item was quite reasonably priced with decent reviews, so it was a go for me. It does the trick! Occassionally it falls off my ear if I'm trying to put on/take off glasses and I would prefer it to be a little louder for times when there's lots of road noise. Also, the one-touch button has been a little tricky, there were times when I wanted to redial that I ended up turning it off or activating voice dial. Overall, I find it very functional for a great price!"
2,Get what you pay for,"it worked, i will give it that. but it was very loose on my ear. it felt like it would fall off with any activty. and people could hear me but i couldnt hear them half the time. i bought a new one within 2 weeks."
4,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray,"Product is good value for the money. Sound quality is good, too. Although I really only ever use it at home, indoors, as my cell phone is my only phone. That said, I cannot say how good it would be outside on a noisy city street, but I'm happy with it so far. It also charges up quickly."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM - I wish I could give it -0- stars,I just got this headset and it won't charge or turn on. It looks like it has been used or refurbished. I say that because the first Motorola Bluetooth headset I got was from my Verizon store and it worked wonderfully for over a year until I recently lost it. This headset from Amazon looks different and is truly an inferior product. I tried to save $20 because Verizon is charging $60. Now I can't wait to return this and go to Verizon and pay the extra $20 to get one that works. I also called Amazon to file a complaint and suggest that they stop selling this item immediately to avoid more bad customer relations. Listen to all of these BAD reviews and don't get this from Amazon. I wish I would have done that.
2,"Good looks,poor volume.",I just recieved my 820hs unit and having lots of trouble hearing anything from it.Poor volume.I don't recomend this model to anyone!
5,Works great!,"I purchased this item for my daughters phone, she is thrilled with it. She hasn't quite figured out all of the features (there are many) but says it works great, she has had no problems with the headset. She says there is no background noise and she doesn't hear herself repeating as some have commented. It is a great headset, I would highly recommend the Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset to anyone looking to purchase a headset."
3,Worth the Money,"This ear piece is worth its cost. It is light weight and recharges in a short period of time. The instructions for marrying the ear piece to the phone fall a little short, but there is an 800 number for Motorola and a quick call helped me to get the two communicating."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I've had this headset for about two months now and although it was inexpensive, I wish I would have saved my money and gotten a more expensive one. I have it paired with my LG 8100. The static is horrible even when the phone isn't 30 yards away. I have the phone right in my pocket! People on the other end can't hear me and I can barely hear them. I always just end up cutting the bluetooth feature off and just putting the phone to my ear. This is my first ever bluetooth headset so I know I will have better luck with the next one I purchase. It couldn't possibly be any worse than this. So if you're interesting in it, please make another selection. Hope this helps:)"
2,Not Great,Sound quality is lacking. I end up using a hand to push the earpiece closer to my ear so I can hear- not exactly hands free. It is comforatble and if you are in really quiet place- it gets the job done.
3,Motorola HS820,This was my first exerience with a Bluetooth headset. Everything worked well on the headset but people were not able to hear me very well. I turned up the volume as high as I could but still was to faint. Send back and now looking for one that has a better mic and is a little less obvious when worn
5,Great Motorola Headset,I usually pay attention to the reviews before I buy anything but this time I went ahead and purchased the Motorola HS820 reguardless of the bad reviews. It works perfect with no problems at all. The charger is even the same as the one for my Motorola V551 cell phone so I don't have to use two chargers. The volume is great and I even forget im wearing it sometimes until someone calls. I don't think all the bad reviews were appropriate for such a great item. It is very compfortable to wear and looks alot nicer that some of the more expensive headsets. There is no echo at all and the people who I am talking to have no trouble hearing me even with the windows down in my car.This is a great buy for the money and you won't regret it.
1,Don't bother,"I bought this headset to pair up with my new Motorola v600 cell phone. It works okay with only minor static even when 2 feet from the phone, however, the volume of sound this headset is capable of is very poor. Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying. In the house it works fine as long as the TV isn't on, however, in an automobile or any environment where there is even average background noise, this is a poor performer. Given the price, I definitely do not recommend.As a side note: No I do not have a hearing problem. I have had a few other 'wired' headsets and they have all been louder than I needed. I am always turning them down."
2,Find a better earpiece option,"Used with a Motorola 815 handsetOthers complain they can't hear me.Others complain of an echo.Does not line up in my ear canal, so I often don't hear very well.When the volume is high, the sound is distorted.My expeience shows battery life to be good.I'm shopping for a replacement."
1,Broke within 6 weeks of purchase,Worked ok until it stopped charging. Could not be fixed. Bought a different model since this one died so quickly.
1,What a letdown...,"I went to my local Best Buy to buy a Bluetooth Headset, and this one is the one I came across. I was impress with it first hand. However, after a month, it stopped working! I couldn't even turn the darn thing on! I went back to get a replacement. The replacement wasn't that much better. At first it worked. After a while, however, I could listen to the other person, but the other person couldn't hear me for some odd reason! I'm very disappointed considering the fact that this Bluetooth Headset is from Motorola! Sorry to say, avoid this one at all costs!"
4,Good range,"I've been using this paired to my laptop for skype calls, and it works pretty well. I can move throughout my apartment without loss of signal. Sound quality is decent."
4,Not a bad headset,"Works as advertised. Doesn't do anything flashy, but I wasn't expecting it to for $25. Battery life seems sufficient, and haven't had any issues with it losing the bluetooth signal. My only complaint is that I wish it were a bit louder, but I find the volume to be enough for most situations where there isn't a lot of background noise."
3,Good Product,"Product works well, as you'd expect from a Motorola Bluetooth device. However, the hinge gets loose after a month's use and I find that the volume does not get loud enough for me at the highest setting. This could be a function of my hearing (have not been tested in a while and probably should be) but I sense that it just doesn't have a really good volume range."
2,"going, going gone.....","Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day."
2,I heard too many complaints,I stopped using this item after hearing too many people complained they couldn't hear me well when I used it. I wasn't able to stick with it long enough to know whether it's very durable.
4,Overall Good,"Light weight, easy to use. At first feels like it is gonna fall off but it doesn't. Works good.Just wish they would make them with smaller ear piece. Good reception."
1,that one star is generous,"This is an AWFUL product. It advertises that it fits on either ear, and it is really only designed for the right ear because the stick part does not rotate around the ear loop to accomodate the other side. Also, everyone you speak to while on this headset will get really frustrated because you sound like you are in a tunnel miles away. Well, you might get frustrated, too, since it means you have to repeat yourself a million times. If you like being frustrated and making returns, then I say go for it! Otherwise, find something better."
2,Use HS850 rather than 820!,"I have used both 820 first and then 850. You get much better voice calarity and don't have to speak loud when using 850. Pay slightly more for the 850, but total worth it over the 820."
1,Don't buy! there is a bug in the firmware,"Hi,I purchased this item andit hung on me withing a week.There seems to be a bug where when you charge the headset it canget stuck in pairing mode and not respond to input. It won't turn the light off now and can't be used.back it goes to amazon on tuesday!"
2,Several Issues,"Having owned a previous Jabra 250 headset, I must say this Motorola was of piss poor quality. The first and foremost issue is the echo everyone claimed to hear when I used the headset. Furthermore, if the headset was not perfectly directed to your mouth, people could not hear you. Otherwise, the device had stadard consumer electronic build quality i.e. poor build quality. I advise you spend more on a better model or pass on Motorola all together. Have a nice day."
2,El Cheapo,"This product feels flimsy and cheaply constructed at first. That is because it is flimsy and cheaply constructed. Charging up to $80 for $.20 worth of plastic seems like a crime to me. This product is simply not suited to the everyday life that a Bluetooth accessory endures. It worked fairly poorly from purchase, with it's multi-function button being as finicky as a two year old child. Microphone quality is average. Ear speaker quality is below average. The range from base is quite over stated; at any more than 10 feet from the phone sound becomes very distorted. I have now owned the product for 3 months, and it has (gasp!) stopped working. I am amazed that it lasted this long. I believe that Bluetooth technology is a boon for the wireless nation. I think that it may even save lives. I also think that Motorola's entry into this world is an abject failure. A cheap, overpriced piece of garbage. For shame, Motorola. For shame."
3,This Item Is alright.,"I received the item very quickly, nicely packed. The item was just a defect, but overall it was an okay item, the updated models of the Motorola Headsets are better. Don't settle for less."
5,Great Device,This device works great and is 10 times more comfortable then any other blue tooth headset I've Tried.
1,Buy something else,"They say you can walk 30 feet away, it should say 15 because after that it gets statick. Also, driving in the car is horrible. Sure its nice to voice dial (after 3 or 4 tries) but the volume is too low. You have to hold the earpiece to your head to have a conversation. I would NEVER buy this junk again."
1,why isn't there a zero stars rating?,this is horrible. can't hear out of it. i've tried with two of these headsets and they blow. do not buy.
3,good but I lost it,I have a Treo and it was easy to install but I found the volume low at times and it was looseas a result I have lost the itme and need to purchase a new one!
3,Needs better quality,"When I first bought this headset, I was very happy. As a busy mom of 2, it was great to talk while keeping my hands busy loading up the car, etc. However, I have a few issues: 1.) Headset will not hold a charge. I turn it off with a full or almost full charge, but when I go to use it a day or 2 later, it's dead. 2.) People complain that I sound muffled and they have to strain to hear me, although I can hear them well. 3.)Portability issues: They need to introduce a neck strap and miniature case for storage. It gets lost in a purse, and often I need to remove it from my ear but want to have it near."
3,"Good reception, short battery","The reception on the device is good, even if I am several feet away from the base. What I don't like is that I can only use it on the right ear (I wish I could change it back and forward to both ears) and the battery only lasts about an hour or one and a half tops after being all charged. And while not using it the battery keeps dying too. So, many times I pick it up to use it again and it's already death. As long as you keep charging it it will be fine."
2,Frustrating,"The only reason I gave it two stars was because it actually did free my hands to drive, as I have a standard transmission. The sound does not go high enough, and often the people I was talking to had trouble hearing me.After the first week or two, it would start automatically switching itself off, after and sometimes during a call. And it would lose interface with my handset very often throughout the day, especially while trying to place calls. This created an almost maddening experience.I will definately look elsewhere for my next one."
2,Poor (very) volume for driving,"I use the headset for driving, mostly highway, 25K miles/yr. Volume is VERY poor at 65 mph in a '04 Passat. It'd be OK for city driving (all windows up please!). Other features are fine, including extremely light weight and battery life. If you will only use ocasionally while driving, you'll be fine."
4,like it a lot!!,"I have been using this with RAZR V3 for 2 months now. I had a couple issues but I learnt to resolve them over time.1)Low speaker volume - set the headset volume to max AND phone volume to max.2)Single button - wish they had separate buttons, atleast for on/off because it gets confusing as the same button is for ON/OFF, sets up bluetooth connection, connects calls, redials. The function depends on how long you have the button pressed. It Took me a while to get used to that!!! (took away 1 star)Pros:Clarity ++battery life ++compatibility with Motorola RAZR V3 ++connection qualitylooksfit to earCons:single button usage.overall... am satisfied!!"
1,Too Quiet!,"This headset is simply unusable in noisy environments. I have found it nearly impossible to use while driving because I have to keep my hand cupped over my ear just to hear the other person. So much for ""hands-free"". Using the headset in busy airports or on buses is impossible. You just can't hear. I also received several complaints from the people on the other end of phone calls saying the singal was terrible. I used to have a Sony bluetooth headset that worked wonderfully. The HS820 cannot even come close."
3,Volume!!!!,"What is it with bluetooths and volume. This is my third and I have to turn it all the way up and than press it in to my ear at times when there is ambient noise around (road noise while in car, crowded rooms, etc.)I want to know if anyone ever uses the lowest volume setting on their headset.Otherwise, a simple to use headset. I like how it just hangs on the ear and I forget it's there."
2,Refurb Sent Instead of New Product,"This item was shipped and to my knowledge was ""as described"" in the description, until recently when I looked closer to see a ""REFURB W"" stamp on the underside of the ear piece. I am well beyond any time frame for returns or exchanges at this point, and am VERY disappointed with Amazon and TigerDirect for not monitoring more closely the products they sell. Selling a refurbished item as new is simply wrong."
1,worked then broke,i used this headset with my mac book pro to talk via skype. it worked well for about two months and then just completely stopped working. i would not recommend this product.
2,"Hello, can you hear me? Nope!!","The headset doesn't fit in your ear. So unless you are in a very quite environment, you'll have a hard time hearing anything. It was almost useless in a car. Battery life was normal. One positive, it did seem to pair quickly with my IPAQ h6510, but there was huge delay when answering calls. Overall you could buy a better product for the same amount of money."
1,This headset in 3 month is not charging,"I recomend to buy other brand this one is not good, in less that 3 month the battery life last only 2 hrs. (BAD)"
4,Good headset.,"The headset does everything the brochure says it should do. Very comfortable fitting headset. Good batter life, and very good voice quality. People that I talked to on the headset, could not tell that I was even on it."
3,Okay but not great,"This product was okay but not great...reason is it is not very loud...if you are going down the highway, it is hard to hear with the volume all the way up. However for the price of online to retailers is fantastic. Easy to use and lasts for long time...It is very light, but I also feel that it hurts when you put around ear for a long time. Needs to have a comfort adjustment for ears or something...I would recommend for the people who can't spend the extra 10 bucks on the better headset."
3,Great product when it works,"I love this Bluetooth. Unfortunately, of the three I purchased, one is completely inoperable, one is spotty at best, and the third is being used right now! When it works it's better than most other brands I've tried. I'm working a refund/replacement for the broken one."
2,They Break too easily....,I've had 3 of these now. I like them I think the sound is good and the weight is light. They are easy too setup and use. The charger goes in upside down to what you would think and if you put it in wrong you end up breaking the connections and it no longer works. This happened to two of them. The last one just stopped working for no apparent reason. I tried to charge it and it didn't charge! I would try a different headset next time.
4,I forget I have it on ...,"I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time, but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it's kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good, it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder, but it serves my purpose."
3,Decent quality but can be hard to hear when driving.,"The main reason I bought a bluetooth headset was to have hands free conversations while driving. This headset sits a little too far away from your ear (especially when you wear glasses) to hear the caller clearly over the ambient road noise. I don't really regret my purchase because the price was good and it is wireless, but if I were to purchase another headset, I would definitely get one that fits into the ear instead of just sitting outside of it."
2,Very Poor Volume,"Functionaly the headset works fine, however the volume is very weak. If you spend alot a time at airports or places with a bit of background noise I would avoid this headset.03/05, Headset died, now I would rate it 0:-("
4,I joined the rest of the people who look like they are talking to themselves.,I have been waiting and waiting to have one of these cause I am always on the go. It is lightweight and easy to use. The thing I don't like about it is sometimes it is hard to hear the person I am talking to unless I am in a completely quiet environment. I find myself constantly trying to turn up the volume. I haven't tried any other models.
3,Not What I thought,The reception is not as good as I thought it would be. When I am out driving I still have to use my cell phone because the headset will say that the signal is weak.
2,Owned two HS820's...not buying a third.,"I have had two of these headsets. I bought them because the price was right. Sound quality and useability turned out to be fine, but both quit taking a charge after 1yr +/-."
2,"Not very good, you can do better.","This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan."
3,"Okay, but not loud enough","This headset is super lightweight, and the sound is good, but the thing is just too darn quiet for traveling (car, airport, etc.). I have to shove it closer to my ear to hear what people are saying when there is any level of background noise. Might as well have the actual phone stuck up against my head."
2,Not for me - realized that late,"Pros : Small, virtually undetectable(compared to other bluetooth headsets). Works great with NOKIA 6230. Clarity and ease of use - the best.Cons : Not much of a comfort fit. Blue light flashing is annoying and irritating. Low battery life. My ears started to ache after couple of days useage. Probably its compatible with Nokia and not with me !."
3,Comfortable but volume not loud enough.,"I use the HS820 in conjunction with a Motorola V551 phone. I bought the phone so I no longer would have to be tethered to a Jabra Ear Boom (which frequently broke and the cord got caught on everything). But the volume of the HS820 at maximum is just too low to be useful. If there is any background noise at all, you cannot hear a conversation using the HS820."
4,Sensitive Tooth....,"Price of model very competitive and delivery prompt. Pairing with phone more time consuming than other models I've used..Unit seems sensitive...when utilizing ""Call Button"" you can deactivate the unit...in error.Reception on unit is good..."
2,Motorola Bluetooth,It worked fine the first few months. Now the battary well not hold the charge and the distence suffered for some resson. I've heard a good review for the billtronic so I think I'm heading that route.
1,Horrible,"I've had this headset for over a year, but I rarely use it for the following reasons: it picks up a lot of road noise; people on the other end have a hard time hearing me; it fits too loose; it looses its charge quickly; and the volume, at the highest setting, is way too low. I end up having to press it against my ear which defeats the purpose of a hands-free. If you plan to use your headset on the road, then be sure to buy one with noise-cancelling: check out the Plantronics Voyager 510 instead."
3,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray,"I won't recommend buying this Bluetooth Headset. I think it is outdated, even though it is discounted. Whoever I called to complained about poor sound quality, like i was talking far from the headset. Also, there is no way to shut a headset off w/out disconnecting it from your phone. A better choice is Motorola HS850, even though it costs more."
5,Motorola Bluetooth Headset,Excellant product. I bought it for my husband. Price was great. It works well. He loves it.
4,Bluetooth,"This device takes your cell phone to a whole new level. While driving alone and using the bluetooth, it's like having another person in your car instead of being on the phone. Much less distracting - a must for everyone who likes to talk and drive!"
2,Disappointed,"I had to return the product because I had to 're-pair' my phone and the earpiece every time I turned off the earpiece. I have just received a replacement and it appears to have the same problem. The only reason that I gave it a 2 vs. a 1 or a 0 is because it works; however, it is annoying and sometimes unsafe to have to go through all the steps each time to get a connection."
1,G-A-R-B-A-G-E,"Hello? Hello? BEEP (searching for bluetooth signal...searching for bluetooth signal)...this is, however, the slickest looking piece of garbage I ever bought!!"
5,Much Better Than Its Predecessor,I enjoy this headset b/c it looks much cooler than the previous one that I bought. I don't hear anyone complaining of an echo anymore and the clarity is much nicer. The Bluetooth headsets make life easier b/c I can do all sorts of things while stil holding a conversation. I also appreciate this one more b/c it fits comfortably on my ear which was a problem w/the previous version b/c it didn't take into account not all of us have normal or large ears.
1,Worst Bluetooth Headset Ever?,"This is my third bluetooth headset and it is the worst I have had. It doesn't hold a charge for more than a couple of days and it will power off by itself without pushing any buttons even when the battery has just been fully charged. If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it."
2,My first Bluetooth experience,"I bought the HS820 to go with my Motorola V3 RAZR which I've complained about elsewhere. The headset was my first Bluetooth headset and my first over-the-ear headset. I never liked over-the-ear units before and I still don't find them all that comfortable but I got over that. My first gripe is that I don't think the volume is high enough for my use in an econobox car that has lots higher pitched background noises-especially at highway speeds. Then after three months of use I noticed a marked reduction in battery life and the charge port started to wear out so I couldn't get a good connection to the charger (which doesn't help run times). I use other Bluetooth devices now and after almost a year of use, my HS820 will no longer take a charge and is dead. Hey, at least it's light and looks cool on the counter."
1,Broken,It came broken. I called that day and got a return number. I mailed it back the next day and I still do not have my money back.
2,1st blue tooth headset,"This was my first bluetooth head set and I was not impressed. The sound was very tiny, volume was poor, and it broke within 2 weeks due to the motorola power interface being so tight that while inserting the male end into the device it bent the internal contacts.Now I see why this model was on sale when I bought it.Only think I liked was its size and confort while wearing it."
4,Good for Price,"I bought this one as a replacement of Logitech. Found more versatile than Logitech, But not perfact, you can hear noise when its inactive. Its range is too short, its activate and deactivate by itself when phone goes off the range and comes in range, it should be a good feature but because of short range it becomes annoying sometimes. other than all these over all Thumbs UP!!! Over all Liked it."
5,Great Technique Illustration,"I have gotten frustrated by books that only show a person how to make product ""X"". This book teaches the reader several techniques and how to apply them. From the beginning of the book the reader is encouraged to consider the creative process and experiment with their own techniques and designs. While you are learning specific techniques, Tori Hughes also points out that changes in color and style will also work well. Through this she is teaching the reader, not just showing them how to do a project. That alone makes this book a valuable asset to a book shelf. I highly recommend this book."
5,Theory and art classes as well as projects,"I just received this today, and have read quite a bit ofit. I'm thrilled to see that the author has elaborated herapproach to art as well as provided ""projects"" to practicewith. I have taken her live classes and used alot of hervideos and appreciate her whole life attitude to art. Besidessharing the tiniest details of what makes simulation sowonderful, she expounds on the thought process and role yourmind and body plays in art. There are no errors, just waysto collect information. Well done, great photos, nicecollection of work in the gallery portion of the book."
1,Puzzled,"I can't understand why this book has such rave reviews. This is the reason I purchased it but was very disappointed and sent it back. I think it is a waste of money and maybe my view is based upon the fact that there are so many good polymer clay books that followed this one. If I hadn't sampled these newer books maybe I would be like the other consumers here, giving it five stars. In all honesty, save your money for something better."
3,Kripsi-licious,"I buy these to save money in the long run, because the children tend to waste more if they use larger boxes. Unfortunately, the cereals packaged in their own bowls seemed to be used more in our house and I will probably go back to those once these are gone. All in all, they are good, and if they were a different variety (say, fruit loops) that could be snacked on a little easier they would probably have used them as a carry along snack food."
1,plastic parts are not good in quality,"Ive used this item for just few weeks and the rotating head part becomes sticky I send email twice to the seller but they dont give any response, I may consider it is really light in weight but not durable enough"
5,"Hamza al Din, move over","The best Nubian oud playing since Hamza al Din. Only Mustapha is Sudanese, vs. Eyptian, and his playing is sweeter and smoother. Great music by a great artist."
4,Good designs.,"This is generally a good book, I use it quite a bit for designs. However, the charts are not as readable as they could be. For example, the Englebreit books are excellent in this respect and have better color. From a fourteen year old who has been doing cross stitch for three years."
3,"Good, But Disappointed","This book has many, small cross stitch patterns which may be combined for a larger sampler or project. My disappointment came with the Christmas section. Every pattern involved Santa. There are only two small patterns, one a fireplace, and a small Christmas design using red and green floss. There is a good section on florals, and another on pets. The patterns must be photocopied because the book does not stay open while you work on your article, which is frustrating."
5,A must have,"If you do any of your own graphing or mixing of patterns, this book is a must have for design ideas!!!"
5,A wonderfully eclectic mix of music for children and parents,"What a wonderful mix of rhythms and styles, languages and tunes! My 15 month old loves to dance to Fatu Yo, the song from Senegal. It is a pleasure to find a children's album that isn't sacchrine or monotonous. It is a delight!"
5,So much fun!,"This cd is really fun for all ages - yes, including adults! (my 7 kids are between the ages of 1 and 13)We usually listen when we are in the van - and the kids often ask for several of the songs to be repeated. I like the diversity from tune to tune and that the selections are from around the world. This is a great choice if you want a refreshing change from the usual children's selection of music."
3,Not what I expected,"I, as an adult, really enjoyed the cd but was disappointed for my 16 mo. old daughter. I was unable to preview it prior to purchasing it but read all the great reviews and decided to buy it anyway. I was expecting or assuming that the songs would include voices from children. I believe only one of them does. My daughter is fascinated by children's voices and didn't respond much to the adult voices. The music is great for bopping up and down and getting into a dance mode but still feels too much adult-like music for me. I have many other Putamayo cds that I listen to and enjoy. I just expected this to be geared more to little people."
3,Not Bad,We received this and Rhythm 4 Kids at the same time and we preferred the latter for its selection and rhythms.
5,Evenflo Home Decor Wood Gate,"FYI - Only gates manufactured prior to September 2001 were recalled due to faulty hinge mechanisms. There have been no recalls on this model of Evenflo gates since then. I've only owned this gate for a short time, but so far I love it. It's extremely sturdy, well-made and looks beautiful!"
2,Wasted Weekend,"First of all, I am not an engineer but am pretty savvy with instructions and installations. I have purchased several other gates and never had a problem.1. This gate is made of quality material but the hardware sent with it is crap.2. If you buy this, throw out the directions. They are COMPLETELY worthless.3. The gate latching system isn't easy to use and honestly hurts my finger as the day wears on. When my small baby arrives, I will have a hard time juggling him and my toddler while trying to open this gate. Not good.4. Your stair configuration must be PERFECT or this gate will not work. We were one of the lucky people that this DIDN'T work for. I opted to install it in our hallway versus sending the gate back. Honestly, I wish I had sent it back. It really doesn't serve my needs like I wanted since the stair option was out.5. If I could do this again, I would buy something else and forget about blocking my stairs (pressure mounted gate with foot pedal or something!)."
2,low quality finish,"We didn't even get a chance to install this gate. It came chipped and the finish is very cheap and seems it will chip as soon as your child puts their mouth on it, which is inevitable."
3,Nice Gate Terrible Instructions,"Although this gate is very pretty once you get installed, I had to hire a carpenter to interpret the instructions. He installed it twice and the locking mechanism would not work. I finally gave it a go myself (after 3 mos) and finally got it to work. I would recommend that these instructions be overhauled. They were probably written in a foreign language and then translated to English. Something gets lost in the translation."
5,Beautiful Gate,I am an in home child provider and I have received multiple complements on this gate! Very durable. Only problem is that the screws given would not hold the gate mounted onto the wall. I had to get toggles and they hold it up great!!
2,Bad Hinge Patend (Plastic Breaks),I have this same gate and my 24 month old was standing next to the gate and pushed it and the gate broke from the plastic hinges and he and the gate both went flying down the staircase of 12 steps. I just called evenflo and they are sending me the replacements hinge base... but will take over 2 weeks to get that. They claim that there haven't been too many problems...but I've read a few of this same thing happening on here.... well my son could've broke his neck or even worse. They really need to see why this is happening with these gates. The hinge base should not be made of plastic.
2,Do not buy if you have irregular walls or banisters,"Yes, the woodwork is lovely and I was very sad that I couldn't use these in our house, but what the description doesn't tell you is that it can only be mounted on a perfectly flat surface. So, if you have molding along the bottom of the wall or woodwork on the banister, you can't use it. The instructions even say you can't use it. I thought about buying a gate adapter to attach to my banister but it doesn't fix the wall problem. Yes, I could've drilled a piece of wood into the wall that was flush with the molding and then drilled the gate into it, but that is just silly."
1,"Don't bother buying this gate, not safe.","Please do not bother with this gate. I had mine for my 1st child, the hinge broke, but after 3 years, and he and friends were playing with it, so I thought nothing of it. Didn't need it anymore anyway. Now I have a 15 month old. I ordered replacement hardware after discovering that there was a recall. They sent me the LATCH hardware not the hinges. Re-ordered the hinges for $12. They broke after 1 week, and the lower screw heas was snapped right off. Ok... so I thought maybe I installed too tight, but nothing really explaines why the screw broke. Called them, orederd the hardware again, the credited me my $12, gee thanks. Started to re-install, and every screw I tried BROKE. I am NOT superwoman. This was completely unacceptable. The scres are now stuck in my bannister. I cannot re-install the gate at all, nor go I WANT to!I have filed a complaint with CPSC, they are doing a home study."
2,Gate is ok.,"First off, this product shipped from Target and they shipped the wrong color. Amazon handled the exchange well but it was an inconvenience. Second the installation instructions are not that clear. I had to use the spacers thinking that they should be directly across from one another. This is not the case as the latch catches are not on center, so when the gate is closed it is not parallel with the wall. Its not that noticable, but if you install it yourself, you are reminded of it every time you see it. The other thing is that I had to cut a board to mount the hinge side to my stair railing. The height of the gate is a lot shorter than a normal railing, so if you don't have square ballisters, plan on an additional piece you will need to make for a good installation. Overall the gate seems sturdy and my daughter loves to pull herslef up on it and look through especially if someone is on the otherside. I trust it, and I guess that is what is important."
3,Poor hardware,"The gate itself is nice and looks great with our stairs. It is easy to operate, although I wish my 3 year old could open it herself. The hardware that came with it was very poor though. We stripped screws, broke the heads off of the screws, and overall had a very difficult time assembling it. The instructions were not very clear either. I talked to my daycare provider who has two of these gates and she said that they used all of their own hardware for it because they had the same problems. If you are handy and can supply your own hardware, its a great gate, if you are not a DIYer then maybe look for a different one."
1,flimsy plastic hinges & locking hardware,"The gate itself is sturdy but the hinges are cheap plastic. In the one & half years we have owned it we have had to replace broken hinges, which are now sagging & looking like they will break again soon. my toddler has knocked the gate off the hinges and now the dog simply puts her nose under the gate & easily pops it right over the locking mechanism"
2,Hinge problems,"This gate looks great. It is classier looking than most child gates and matched my decor very well. However, the hinges were inferior. They are plastic and just didn't hold up well. We tried to find other solutions, but were unsuccessful. After spending a lot of money to purchase this gate, it's sitting in the basement because it's unusable. Save your money and buy a different gate!"
4,"great product, difficult to install",We really like this gate not only it's looks but functionality. A bit on the difficult side to install but worth it.
4,"Nice Gate, Installation tricky.","The gate itself looks and operates good, once you finally get it installed. There are several issues with the installation instructions to avoid. The screws sent with the gate are poor quality, don't use them. The instructions also say to use an 1/8"" drill bit. This pilot hole is too tight and will snap your screws off. I went to a 5/32"" bit and had no problems. The shorter screws sent for fastening the gate brackets are not tipped. these would work if the factory drilled pilot holes on the gate lined up with the brackets (they don't-they are offset a bit). I used my own self tapping screws and had no problems. Lastly, as the gate panels off set, you need to make sure and offset the wall template towards the latch side, otherwise your gate will be installed at an angle (no mention of this on the instructions)."
4,Throw out the included screws,"While I like the gate design and attractiveness I had difficulty installing it because the screws that were included kept breaking and no kindergartner could understand the instructions and illustrations. So my advise is to throw the screws out and purchase new ones. I wished I would have followed this advise that other reviewers had posted. But I thought I was smarter and a better carpenter. Boy was I wrong. Even with pre-drilled holes, the screws snapped off. The other thing I don't like about it is the latch mechanism. While I know it is meant to be for the safety of children, it is extremely difficult for larger adult hands to open until you get the hang of it."
2,Screws need upgrading,This screws supplied with this gate are too weak. I predrilled all of the holes as outlined in the instuctions. Double checked my depth an still ending up stripping one and breaking another. Just what I didn't want in my hardwood railings extra screw holes from broken screws.
4,Attractive and works,"This gate is wooden and looks nice with the wood trim of the doorway. I needed a gate to install above the floor level, to keep an adult out of a room. This gate opens totally, without leaving a support bar across the bottom, so it is one of the few that are suitable for using in the vertical middle of a doorway. Most pet gates have a support bar across the bottom of the gate so that would block the opening if the gate is used above the floor level."
4,Evenflo Home Décor Wood Gate,Looks great. Very well made. Bought it to keep our Huskies out of the bedrooms. One clap of thunder and that was the end of that. Lifted it right up with her nose. Will work well for most dogs. Just remember it's closed when you walk down the hall at night with the lights off.
2,Stopped installation to come write this review!,"I have to agree with all the others about the installation! It's terrible and has taken up the better part of my day. They could use a lesson from Ikea in PRE DRILLING holes into the spacers! I also don't understand why Evenflo would put plastic hinges on a sturdy, heavy gate. This gate is pretty, but a headache. Evenflo should send a guy with the gate to help get it working (and I say that while my husband slaves away trying to finish the job)."
4,Product OK--Assembly Instructions Terrible,"I had read the on-line comments about the difficulty in assembling the gates. These comments were absolutely correct. The manufacturer should be ashamed of these dreadful instructions. I made it through by trial and error and generous use of a drill. (The oak is extremely hard wood,and I broke several drill bits.) Anyway, the parts are labeled/named poorly, the diagrams are hard to follow, and the wood spacers can be avoided if you properly place the spacer brackets. Good luck to future purchasers."
5,Best gate ever!,I have this dog gate in my home in NY and it looks more like a decorative entry to my kitchen then keep my dogs confined. It is made of sturdy wood and not too bad to install.They give you a template for lining up the closure. It can even keep my 4 lb chihuahua in. The coloring is beautiful and will match any decor. Worth the money and the durability and quality is excellent. I also purchased it for our home in FL and I am just so pleased with the item. My daughter has one at the top of the stairway to keep my grandchildren from doing a header down the stairs. Childproof and a nice wood accent. I recommend it for anyone that doesn't like those white plastic baby gates or the ones that have the plastic netting. I got the Harvest Oak and color blends with everything.
4,Book on what food and cooking was like on the Oregon Trail,"Finally, the book I've been looking for in researching the Oregon Trail, WAGON WHEEL KITCHENS is a detailed description of food acquistion and preparation on the Oregon Trail. It was also an interesting book to read."
4,NOT a cookbook,"This book dwells on the stocking up of wagon trains. Dried foods, Cured meats, and staples that can be easily rationed until the next supply center.While there ARE certainly some recipes, they are interspersed with the narrative, and not separately cataloged. So if you are looking for a specific recipe, you will be unlikely to find it. But, if you stumble across one, they are often very tasty, and fun to try on your friends.It is a nice historic prairie kitchen account."
2,I dont know what to say.,It works well but it doesn't hold a charge for too long after about 2 months. I just us the power outlet from the wall now.
4,Very Good Battery For The DSC-F717!,"This makes the fourth NPFM50 battery I have bought for the Sony DSC-F717. The first battery konked out after a time without knowing why exactly, but the two after that have worked flawlessly and for a great length of time. I expect that the fourth battery (which hasn't arrived yet) will do just as well. This battery has great longevity in between charges and is well-made. I take away one star because of the original battery konking out."
1,Beware - NOT a new battery!!!!!,"To anyone thinking of buying from this company - think again. I read a few reviews about this product and company and chose to disregard the warnings but I should really have listened. The battery was shipped to me very quickly and arrived long before I expected it. Unfortunately, that's the only positive thing I have to say. You'll notice that they only advertise NEW batteries but the batteries ARE NOT NEW!! I opened the package and out fell the battery - by itself with no packaging or anything and small scratches all over it. Don't trust this company. This is obviously a used or refurbished battery (thus the price) and I wish I would've known."
5,Sony NPFM50 InfoLithium,"i recieved great service .got product in a fast manner. i have purchased many things from amazon, and every one has been excellentthank you"
2,Sony NP-FM50 InfoLithium Battery,"I have been surprised and dissappointed in this battery. This is the battery that my camera uses and because I always use what is recommended for my products I felt purchasing this Sony battery would be good. Wee, it worked for a couple times and today when I turned on the camera it says - For ""InfoLithium"" Battery only. It then procedes to turn off. I threw my old battery out (same kind as this one) and now without a camera! Would not order again."
2,poor performance,"did not last very longThese don't seem to be TRUE Sony batteries.I think they were counterfeit, did not last as long as original Sony batteries."
1,Do not buy from them!! Not a new battery. !!,"Received this battery, and found out that it is not new. It clearly have been used before, for there are scratch marks all over the place.There is no where from the descripion says it's used. I will not buy from them again.!!!! :<"
1,This is not a SONY battery,"The battery I received is NOT a SONY battery, but a ""for SN-NP-FM50/55H"" battery. I still have not been able to figure out the chinese manufacturer behind this copy. Who is responsible if this thing blows up in my hand?Did not check the performance yet, but feel cheated by the product description. Would welcome comments from vendor."
5,Works great!,This battery looks and works exactly like the original battery that came with my Sony camera. Works great and it is nice to have a second for backup.
2,You can get all these recipies online,"Saveur is amazing. Their magazine and website are very comprehensive and filled with amazing recipes and ideas. With that said...you don't need to by this book to get French recipes. Every one of these recipes is online either on the actual Saveur website or from some other source. I can't fault the recipes in this book because they were authentic French recipes, but I was kind of hoping for recipes that were a little obscure. French onion soup is fairly common and the recipe in this book is really dated. I suggest finding a different French cook book. If you want classic get something by Julia Childs."
2,Let's be honest folks.,"1. Probably the best cooking in the world is now done in the US. The most money, the most flexibility, the best ingredients, the most time. 2. This is a great picture book3.These may be classic french recipes, but it ain't going to turn your crank.4. The recipes are boring.I hate to be boring and aggresive, but Charlie Trotter, Emeril Lagasse,Miller from the Coyote Cafe, Ming Psai, are more creative than any chefs in the world.Sorry."
4,"Authentic French A Big Hit, 3 Receipes Family Success!","I have ""worked"" to identify in the book and bring forth three receipes with complete detail without alterations to the table. I have had unconditional success with my Family, my most honest critics!"
1,Awful!,"I've read other Lori Foster books in the past and liked them. So, I thought I would give this one a try. I hated it! I couldn't get into Carlie's character. There was no background as to why she was so prickley and I ended up hating her because I thought she was such an idiot. If I had a hot guy like Tyler poring his heart out to me, I wouldn't push him away. I didn't like how she acted and her personality just stunk. Not a good read, don't know why it is getting good reviews."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"I'm not quite finished with the book; I'm just over halfway, but it has been a battle to get this far. I understand the jerk ex-husband and him killing her self esteem, but I really feel like that has been blown way out of proportion. Enough with the I'm chubby, no one will like me. Of course no one will like you if you keep treating men the way Carlie is treating Tyler! He just keeps trying to get to know her and she just keeps refusing. I just think the ""poor me"" character was taken too far and that is ruining it for me."
5,NURSEKEISHA,"This is a very good book about the adventures of finding that one true love even though you are totally from diffrent leagues.This book has the added bonus of hot sex, and mystery.yummy, yummy :)"
3,A taste of things to come..........,This is Lori in the begining. The diffculty I found with this book was that I already read all the books Lori had written but... I found this one a bit lacking. This book is a recommended purchase for those who have yet to taste Lori........and for those who have read Lori's other books and wish to maintain a collection (as I have).
3,eh..,"I like the storyline of this book, but the main female character's attitude was a bit off. She seems very insecure (which she had valid reasons to) but also very defensive about everything. Over all, it was another good book from Foster."
2,My first and last Harlequin romance,"OK, it was on Kindle and it was cheap, so I took a chance. Started off with a bang with a hot sex scene and never regained any hotness. Way too much pop psychology for my taste. The dialogue was often painfully off, and the guy didn't seem like any guy I've ever met. I didn't find out it was a Harlequin romance until about 80% through it, so I kept hoping it would improve. Now I see that it was probably Lori's first published work back in 1996. No wonder it was such a dog. I did finish it because it was short and I needed another book on my list to catch up with my wife. If you're not counting, don't bother with this one! I give it 2 stars just because I had to find out what happened at the end. Give me Lisbeth Salander any day. Or try Paulo Coelho's Eleven Minutes."
4,Good Read,This was one of the first books I ordered on my Kindle and I am happy I did. Carlie and Tyler were so cute. There were times while reading I wanted to scream at Carlie and then hug her the next. This book is definitely worth reading.
4,"Quick, fun, witty read","How can I prove to you that this story is worth reading? How about the fact that I loved the story so much that I'm slowly, and painstakingly typing this review on my Kindle.The story and characters were simply amazind. I loved the fact that it made me feel. A number of times I could actually feel pangs in my heart when the characters had a bad interaction. And for the price? Its more than worth it."
2,Not very impressive,"This books explains the very basic knowledge of available-light photography, like when and how to use a tripod. Additional information is given about how to choose and use the right (Kodak-) film for specific situations. Thus I can recommend this book only to beginners in this field or people with their own lab. The photographs in this book are old and not very impressive."
2,kitchen collecting of mashers,If you love potato mashers you will love this book because 40 pages are full of nothing but mashers. That is why I gave it 2 stars.
1,The worst Star Trek season of all time,"I am a big Star Trek fan and watched all series and movies and read also a lot of books. ENT is clearly the worst Star Trek series but however there are some good episodes in the first two seasons.It is the first season of ENT with Star Trek in the title but this season is a betrayal of Star Trek. Capt. Archer tortures a prisoner, steal a Warpcore from friendly Aliens and did a pre-emptive strike against other Aliens. This is not Star Trek!!!Therefore spend your money and your time for TOS, TNG, DS9 or VOY but not for this rubbish."
2,Five for the Seasons but 1 for the UNbox,"Too many bugs in the system, just fully downloaded only two of episodes the rest getting error x&80bblahblahblah. No matter how apt you are with computers the system is just not user friendly..Love the episodes after watching them on DVD but wished this system would work."
4,One of the better Enterprise episodes,"When I saw the title and the synopsis I was thinking ""oh no not another cheesy western Star Trek episode"". I'm glad I gave it a chance, it's done right. In fact this has taken a place on my favorites from this series. It's got great action, the back-story is original, the guest actors are superb, and the conclusion is awesome.Now if only I could have seen a six-shooter laser pistol :D"
3,A bit of a distraction,"It was a risky gamble to dedicate an entire season to one story arc. It didn't quite pay off. There are many great episodes, like ""Twilight,"" ""Similitude,"" ""Azati Prime,"" ""E Squared,"" and ""Zero Hour,"" however, the effort probably could have been better spent on expanding on the mythology related to early Trek species rather than creating an original storyline."
3,Lost,"This was the season where I lost interest. I loved the first two seasons, but don't want to have to keep up with everything because each episode is really just a continuation of the last episode. Weren't the first two seasons a hit? Almost completely stand alone episodes. They ruined the show because after each episode I felt like it's not over. How do you watch one of these episodes when you know you are left hanging. After season two ended with the attack on Earth, I figured next season would be two or three episodes to deal with the enemy and move on to regular stories. That's what they should have done. There was nothing wrong with the show but then season four is comprised of mostly two, three or four part episodes. The original Star Trek and the Next Generation were mostly stand alone shows, but I never really liked Next Generation, too politically correct for me."
1,Almost unwatchable,"Wow...I have never given an episode of Star Trek a 1 star...but this was atrocious. I get the ""point"" that was trying to be conveyed this week, but the execution is so boring and amateur...this whole episode should be on the cutting room floor.especially compared to last week's episode which was amazing (one of the best of the series so far)."
2,Same old same old,"You'd think after being burned so many times these people would know better than to take in someone who was a little too eager to get on board their ship. It never ends well for them.Considering how often they seem to be boarded and attacked, they should've replaced most of the crew with military personnel.Another slight ramp up in the Xindi plot, with more in-fighting amongst them, and continuing thin reasoning behind this burning need for genocide."
5,I love this last Star Trek series!,"Sure, there are other Trek series I prefer, but I've grown to love this one and I have watched the complete series several times. Great cast, great character development."
2,"Move along, nothing to see here.","Not good by any means, so I will only state what you would need to continue any subplots that have been running. Trip and T'Pol have more massage therapy (seriously). Oh, and Porthos gives birth to a penguin. ;> (not seriously; though I enjoyed typing these last few sentences more than I did watching this episode). That's. About. It."
3,Not the worst series,Ask me several years ago about Enterprise and I would have said BLAH! It started to grow on me over the years and I wish I had given it more of a chance. I just couldn't get past the whole going back to a ship that predated the original series. Give it a chance you might be surprised!
3,better,this actually wasn't that bad. comment on stem cell controversy with a sci-fi twist. nice ethical dilemmas. decent stand-alone episode overall.
5,Older Star Trek Fan,Finally the series has become more adult. The Captain has grown up and all the other characters have gained more depth. I am surprised to find that they only made one more series. It is a bit like Buffy and Angel - they became more focused on inner conflict and their characters became more realistic or the writers matured and decided to write for a grown up audience. I was so impressed with this series I bought the 4th and final series.Michele Gladden
4,Good but noisy fan,Got this fan to replace a noisy fan in my Dell 8200. It is a decent good quality fan but... I thought that it would be very quiet at the slowest manual speed but it wasn't. The problem is that it vibrates and the Dell fan enclosure amplifies the vabration and the noise at the pitch that is very uncomfortable. I had to return it because it ended up being noisier than the original Dell fan. Another problem with this fan is that the cable is very short barely enough to reach the motherboard.
4,"Better than the first, but not best","I was impressed with the first Dark Dreams by Massey & Co. It wasn't the best horror and suspense/sci fi collection but black writers haven't been showcased before. I thought Zane was out of place and just a way to get other fans into it. I figure Eric Jerome Dickey was the same thing for Voices from the Other Side but his story is very, very good. T Due, Banks and Chambers never disappoint, and the overall quality and depth of this collection is much better than Dark Dreams. I hope the third time will be a charm, and stand up there with anything Clive Barker, Stephen King & Co. come up with. This collection would make a great anthology on cable TV."
5,did not disappoint,"With my hectic schedule, I have time for anthologies , but rarely novels. This one, (Voices From the Other Side)as well the first installment, were alot better than most ""compilations of horror"" I've purchased. I always look forward to the Dark Dreams series, and I hope they keep em' coming. That being said, this series is far superior to other horror fiction.....and the fact that the authors are exclusively black, is just icing on the cake."
2,Searching for Ruth Page,"I have been searching for this book, because I know something about her - that she was a dancer, from the Chicago area, and her life was very interesting. Having found your listing of it, I was very disappointed that it is out of print. Although I doubt that I would have been able to afford the $500.00 dollars you have it priced. I'm hoping to find it in a library."
1,Counterfeits,"I could tell right away the cable I received was not a genuine Mogami. First, it did not come in Mogami packaging. Second, it did not have the protectors on the ends with the Mogami name in gold.After some investigation I learned that these cables are constructed by some guy in Michigan who buys bulk Mogami parts and constructs them himself.This by itself is not bad. That was the only way Mogami cables were available for many years. The problem is he represents them as the genuine article when, in fact, they are counterfeits.I contacted Mogami and they said, ""Premium Audio Cables is not selling cables made by us. He is making them using Mogami and using our trademark without permission.""I also contacted Amazon, but as of this writing, they are still selling these phony cables. I thought you should be warned."
5,The best cable,"I decided to spring for a Mogami cable and am now a believer. Yes, other cables out there may be cheaper, but you do get what you pay for and in my case that means noticeably less line noise in my home studio recording."
4,Plug Works,"Used to plug a KillAWatt unit into an outlet and still be able to use the other outlet.Nothing fancy, just an extension. Would purchase again."
4,Dianic Wicca's Bible,"This book is highly recommended by nearly every Pagan I know. And I too enjoyed, more for the fact that it is a book of spells /and/ theory essays. Anecdotal and practical, it is a hodge-podge of Dianic spirituality. Z.Budapest knows her stuff, and this gathering of knowledge from witchy women is wonderful. The only problem I had was the fact that I prefer organised books, and this isn't one.Blessings."
5,a classic. must read.,"This is a classic text for all those interested in goddess religion. It is written by one of the founding members of the Goddess Religion Movement. It should be read as a foundation stone and as an example of an ""early"" work."
1,Sabine Spring was origionally issued as Two For Texas,"After waiting several months I finally received a used copy of Sabine Spring. It is an understatement to say that I was disappointed to discover that this book is a reissue of Two For Texas, origionally published by Pocket Books, Inc. in 1982. I have no idea why Burke issued the same book under two different titles but I hope that this review will prevent others from purchasing the same book twice as I have."
1,Cheap - Picture is Deceiving,"If your girlfriend / wife likes Dolphins - and this pendant appeals - do yourself a favor and skip it. It is so light, and cheap as to be confused for plastic. In fact, if it didn't have a metallic 'clink' when it touches metal I would swear it was.Very cheap."
1,Experimento,"Este es un experimento, de ninguna manera pienso leer este libro (no quiero escribir ""no"", para burlar a los motores de búsqueda) pero no le doy solo una estrella para probar si la gente de este sitio lee los comentarios en español antes de publicarlo. Si logras leer esto, entonces, obviamente la respuesta es no."
5,Great space saver!,"I love this rack! Not only can it hold all your pots, it has a upper shelf as well. I keep my bread up there! It's very pleasing to the eye! Highly recommended! Easy to install too!"
2,"Quality looked good, but finish was not attractive at all.","I have to admit that I agree with one of the earlier posters, the finish is nto attractive at all. It looks as if it was painted with splatter paint. I've returned the item and decided it's worth it to pay a bit more money for a higher quality product."
4,"Very nice, but mount to studs","This is a great space saver, but unless you're using it for only a few pans, I would definitely advise against using the wall mounts included. Instead, follow the instructions submitted by Dave regarding the 1/4"" x 2"" lag screws and put it directly into studs.The 'shelf' included doesn't feel terribly sturdy, so you will probably find that you hang most items directly on the rack instead. I added a photo of our rack to this item, it's the one that's off center over a butcher block."
2,Fuctional but unattractive finish,"Do not let the term ""hammered steel"" deceive you. The rack has a very unattractive industrial black/chrome finish over a smooth steel surface. This is not the same finish that is seen on more expensive racks. On the plus side the unit seems sturdy and functional."
4,Very pleased,I am happy with the pot rack I chose and it has proven to be very practical. It does not take up a lot of space (which is what I needed since I have limited space) and is very useful.
1,Not Worth the Money,Not worth $12-doesn't even have a cover for the paper box the checkers came in.Also made of some very light-weight (cheap) wood.
1,Buyer beware!,"These are attractive pieces, but please note the warning that came on the package: ""This product is not a toy! It is not intended for use by children under 13 years old."" As it has nothing to do with the size of these pieces (otherwise they would not be suitable for under 3 years old), the warning may have something to do with other safety concerns -- perhaps something in the paint or stain? The box does not say where the pieces are made. (We're not risking it; we returned them.)"
4,Simple & Cheap,"These are simple wooden checkers.Quality is OK for occasional use but they lack the weight required to provide the tactile pleasure generally provided by some of the older style sets which are hard to find these days. This means the pieces are easily moved by accident, for example by the cuff of your sleeve. Of course it also means they are safer to have in the house if you have little ones who like to throw things :-).If you are looking for cheap checkers for occasional use or have young children who may lose or throw them these are a good buy."
3,"Not bad, will do the job.",Not bad.. Not quite the quality I expected. Thought for the price they would be a little more better quality.
5,Design It Yourself,I love Design It Yourself. I've been looking for months and this is the first time that someone has been able to explain how the design process actually works. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
3,Very general,Not that detailed but great if you are not going to sit down and read an involved design book. Quick tips.
2,dull,This production is dull in the extreme. I haven't personally heard other versions but expect they might be better. Usually I find Dvorak quite enjoyable but not here. After two attempts to find something interesting here I have moved on.

4,Warm and educational,"I thought the movie was very good. Ms. Alley gives one of her best performances yet. A very warm and moving story, in a fast paced New York lifestyle, and educational. A must see for those who have or know someone with children afflicted with mild mental disorders."
2,won't be trying any other studys like this one,"I won't be trying any other MacArthur studies after this one. It was dry and difficult to get through. Yes it took you verse by verse through Colossians but there was NO life application. The questions were not thought provoking at all. It told you what verse to look at for the answers and honestly most could be answered with generic answers like ""God"", ""Jesus"", and ""the bible"". Glad we got this for cheap."
4,A Good Resource for Expositors,As with the rest of MacArthur's commentaries this volume publishes his sermons from the text. This expositional commentary proves to be helpful in prepartion
2,Not worth the money,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. We thought it would be much nicer than what it turned out to be. Definitely not worth the money. Better to buy a real journal and real stationary.
3,so so,"It seemed like the product sat on the shelf too long. The stickers were very hard to remove from the backing and the scissors were worthless. However the girls were very happy with the product and it entertained them for almost 2 hours. The price was right, but I was hoping for more than a one time use."
2,Maybe for short flight,"This seems like a well-made product. It slipped over my 10-month-olds head easily and fastened snuggly, although the straps attached to the buckles shown in the photo are tightened and held in place with velcro, which doesn't seem as secure. The major problem with this for us was that we were on a long overnight flight. Even though the vest isn't bulky, the buckles were placed so that they seemed uncomfortable when she was lying down in our laps. Also the loop that attaches to your seatbelt is on the back, so your child would have to be sitting up and facing forward for it to work. If you plan to shift your child from place to place, or have them lie down and sleep or nurse, I don't think it would work that well. In the end, we used it for 5 minutes and decided it wasn't really helping. Not sorry we tried it, it just didn't work for us."
1,sear restraint,I didn't get to use the product. the airline no longer lets families with small children on first so we had less time to get situated. Felt rushed trying to get my two kids comfortable and ready for the long flight.
4,A Nice Book to Have In a Reference Library,"Before obtaining Dress Design by Hillhouse and Mansfield, and Modern Pattern Design by Harriet Pepin; this book was one of my go-to books.It contains much of the info you need to clear up some of the jargon you'll often find in other sewing books, and other tasks you first encounter in sewing; I used this book often and in conjunction with the 1972 Vogue Sewing Book.I recommend this with the Vogue sewing book for the would-be beginner, or as an addition to a sewing reference library."
5,Everthing about sewing in one book,Great book about sewing. I hadn't sewn in twenty years and this book's great illustrations and text have guided me back and I'm now a better seamstress than I was back then! It covers topics from beginner needs to advanced seamstress issues. This edition and ealier ones apparently have more information included than the newer ones.The book is organized in a logical way that makes finding what you want a snap.
3,Some good stories,"Most of these are not worth reading more than once. However, ""The Legend of the Paper Spaceship"" is a haunting, beautiful story. To me, that redeems the book. The rest of them are amateurish at best, though ""The Savage Mouth"" has a certain shock value about it."
2,Hope these are not the best.,"With a few exceptions these stories are dull and tedious. I know the Japanese can do better than this, I've read better."
1,Scifi Haiku from Japan,"This collection of Japanese scifi was touted by its translators as a splendid collaboration mixed with much eating, drinking and general fooling around. Unfortunately, these stories must have seemed fabulous ""under the influence"" but to a middle-aged American scifi fan of over 45 years, the tales are too simplistic and unoriginal. Mainstream Japanese fiction is much more interesting than these pale, inscrutable stories."
5,just what i wanted,"I had been looking everywhere for this dvd since i was in high school. When i became a member on amazon, i found it with one description!! i enjoy working out to billy blanks ultimate abs it firmed me up when i was in school, now i am working on doing it again 8 years later..thank you Amazon!!!"
1,TERRIBLE,"THIS is a terrible textbook. The material is not well written and should never be used in a classroom. The study questions are tooooo easy. Basically, poorly written & toooo easy for students."
1,Not worth it.,"The chair itself was alright, very short/low back makes it far less comfortable than most. My biggest complaint was the cost of shipping ... far more than the chair was worth. I would not purchase it again."
1,not so great,"so i ended up getting rid of these fairly quickly. used on 2001 Ford Excursion (basically an F250) and it ruined my front tires. i verified this, i wouldn't say something like this if i wasn't sure it was the shock and not my badly aligned front end. my tires cupped badly, all over. got rid of these shocks (fixed nothing else) and now - no more cupping.my truck mechanic told me that he knmows several other ford guys who used these, ran into same issue, sorry to say."
3,I wish that the night light fit outlets that are horizontal,"We bought this nightlight because it is part of our theme. However, I wish that they made a nightlight that would look okay in a sideways outlet. For us, the bear looks like he is laying on his side rather than sitting."
2,Excellent description of air crew life.,"Fantastic flight sequences. Makes you feel like you are almost onboard. The politics, hi-tech jargon and see through characters with the 1950s military propaganda (we are the best) attitude is a bit much. For true flight freaks"
4,Great read,"This book both entertains and educates as it follows a ""possible"" scenerio, but brings the reader inside a high tech world of military aircraft. It could only be written by a man that knows."
4,Exciting and realistic read,"Excellently told military thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. A highly-recommended read that begs not to be put down. Great characters and plot. I am new to Dale Brown, but he's a master story teller. This is a thriller that I would highly recommend for those deep dark nights. You'll forget the storm outside for a little while..."
5,GREAT SHOE,"This was a great purchase, I was a bit hesitant to purchase shoes online but I did it anyway and it was a great buy. They are very comfortable and well worth the $."
5,Doc Martens Slip Ons,I would highly recommend these slip on shoes for those who are on their feet a lot. Very comfortable and they go with just about everything.
3,Great shoe!!,"I have LOVED Doc Martens since I was in high school and this pair is no exception!!! Now a mother of 3 I am always running around and these are the most comfortable shoes I own. The only problem I had was that I have a high arch and these shoes come up pretty high oon the top of the foot. I simply cut the elastic out of the sides and they are fine now, but beware if you have a high arch or instep."
1,worst view-master reel ever,"This was the worst waste of 12$ ever - the best image on the single reel is the one on the cover- all the others are underlit and poor subjects for stereophotography. The park has so many amazing and colorful settings, sculptures and buildings but none of them are on this reel except for the picture you see on the cover. As a stereophotographer, view-master collector, Gaudi fan and visitor to the park I can truly say this reel bites."
5,The best grammar book for English as a second language learner,The best grammar book for English as a second language learner. It took about 3 weeks to ship to Australia.
5,Conclusive Historical Evidence,"David Barton and Wallbuilders own over 7,000 original documents from the pens of the Founding Fathers. This evidence proves beyond all dispute that the Founders were strong Christians and they regarded the concept of ""separation of Church and State"" as repugnant. Jefferson, who coined that phrase, (to bridle the government, not the church, and to avoid an official State Church), placed two textbooks in the D.C. schools, over which he was Superintendent -- the Bible and Watts Hymnal. Strange for someone who might think schools shouldn't teach religion! We've been fed a bill of goods by modern educrats, and David Barton sets the record straight. Recommended for every teacher, minister, educator and school board member you know."
1,Deadly Vows sucks-anything with Gerald McRainy always does!!!,I had to set through this horible predictable piece of garbage today at work because some one was watching it. Any time you see Gerald McRainy in a movie or TV show--you are gauranteed that you are going to be bored out of your mind. I love Peggy Lipton and it's a shame that this good actor would be in a movie with A Simon....why does this kind of predictable tripe appeal to lifetime viewers? If you like this kind of a movie you need to get a life!
4,This is what I was looking for,"One of the most awesome sounds in the worlds is that of an approaching thunder storm, culminating with the slow sprawling crack of thunder rolling across the top of the clouds from horizon to horizon. Its an event not to be dismissed. ""Storm"" had captured the elements with purity, dynamics, and depth. I also purchased a less expensive CD of the same subject matter, and ""Storm"" has it beat on every level. Fork over the extra cost, this time you will get what you pay for."
1,A Worthless CD,I have ordered two pf these and neither one will work on any of the players that I own. This is a unique experience in the over 1400 cds and dvds that I own.
1,vey bad,"1. belt was danmaged 2, the same with mask ,3 two left biceps 4 lines and mistakes on chest , very bad for 660 dolars"
5,Foreign student interracial love,I love this movie i was born in Europe and interracial couples is not a big deal by the way this movie is a true story .I love to see black women with white European men i am part black and interracial love is the best thing .
3,Interesting,"You will love the movie if you are a Robin Givens fan. The movie is about a relationship that Robin has with a foreign student(he is European or French). Society doesn't agree of the relationship, but they continue to see one another."
1,Among the worst text books I have used.,"I had a lot of problem with understanding Reinforced Concrete, I thought it was me, then I discovered the MacGregor text book. If your professor requires the Nawy book, you should still not get it. Get the MacGregor text book instead. This book is very confusing and hard to follow. You will follow along an example then all of a sudden they insert some variable with no explanation. You will then hunt through the chapter for an explanation of the variable only to find out later that it was mentioned four chapters ago in passing in a random paragraph, or was taken from ACI318."
1,Buy a different book,"This book exemplifies the the way a book should not be written. The examples, writing techniques and homework problems in this book are extremely difficient. Numerical mistakes seem to be everywhere in this book. The examples are far from real world application. Very little theory about reinforced concrete is in this book. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,Students Watch Out!,"This book portrays concrete design in a cookbook fashion with little emphisis on actually understanding the material. The explinations that are given are wordy and not clear. While this book might be considered a good refrence book, I would not recomend it for students."
1,Terrible!,"Not only is this book poorly written, the errors contained in this book is confusing for anyone trying to learn about reinforced concrete. The approaches for some of the basic fundamentals can and should be taken differently. I highly discourage this book for learning purposes."
2,Too Easy!,"Along with some of the other reviewers, I was misled by some of the comments and thought that I was ordering the exact piano pieces from the score. These are broken down, beginner versions of these songs. While it is still beautiful music, they are far too simplistic to be enjoyable to play. :("
4,Pretty Sweet,"I like this book a lot. The songs sound like they do in the movie, like they should. However, some of the songs are very very easy, leaving one without a challenge. Overall, it's pretty funny, but I prefer harder stuff. :)"
5,Great for learning,"Every pianist should learn these timeless, fantastic scores. Usable for any situation up to and including weddings, recitals, etc. Such soothing music."
2,Note: Two versions!,"I received the Easy Piano version, not the regular one pictured. Will have to send back for a replacement."
2,for beginners,"I was really disappointed with this product, I am not an advanced piano player but this was a really, really for beginners. I had to go back out and buy a more complicated version - total bummer."
5,A MUST for anyone who loves the movie and knows how to play piano.,The songs are the exact notes from the soundtrack of the movie. And it's very easy - it accomodates piano players from beginner to advanced. I feel like I relive the movie whenever I play it for myself. :D
3,"The music is there, but at a sixth grade playing level.","I ordered this book after having been in love with the soundtrack for about five years and after receiving the sheet music for ""Dawn"" and loving it. However when I got this book, I opened and to find that all the beautiful arpeggios had been replaced with dotted quarter notes. It makes the book appropriate for someone who has not been playing very long, but for me it was sad because it takes away the movement and the expression that makes the performance by Jean-Yves Thibaudet so enchanting.Maybe I just didn't read well enough before I ordered, but I wanted to make very clear for everybody else that this is not the actual original music - it has been simplified, and if you're looking for anything of a challenge, go find another edition."
2,disappointed,"My daughter loves this movie and wanted the music to it. She was disappointed in this purchase because the music is very simple and does not even sound like the music from the movie when played. It was our mistake for buying the wrong thing, but if you are looking for the movie music... this is not it."
3,Nice book,"I bought this music collection because I like the music from the movie, but all the songs,of course, sound similar so if I had to do it again, I would probably look for a collection that included some P&P selections with other musical movie scores. Pretty pieces though."
5,Haven't received the item yet,I don't doubte this product is wonderful. But I haven't received the package but even though it is already charged to my credit card.
2,Simple sheets,"This is a book for people who are introducing piano studies. Most of the songs are quite different from the original soundtrack, still pretty but a little poor."
5,Great Gift,I just bought this gift for my daughter who has been in piano for about 7 years. She said it was a little difficult but with a little practicing she will get it down.I listened to the piano music compared to the soundtrack and I think the book sounds pretty much exactly like the music from the soundtrack. Then again take out all the other instruments and it sounds lovely. I really enjoy this piano book.
4,"Walton's Middle Drawer Isn't Bad, Either","I've been listening a lot to Walton concertos these days, and I'm convinced his concerted music is finer than Britten's. That said, none of the works on the current Naxos disk are from Walton's top drawer, but the Variations show the composer's usual meticulous craftsmanship and dazzling orchestration to good advantage, and Peter Donohoe is a very able spokesman for both concerted works. And then Naxos throws in that great rable-rowser the Spitfire Overture for good measure. Pretty irresistible stuff. Excellent sound, too, as usual from Naxos' English recording venues."
2,"Really, really needs a thorough editing.","It's clear from the author's acknowledgements that he has a very hard time meeting his deadlines and it really shows -- it's obvious his publishers did not have enough time to edit this book!He will gloss over terms many new students may not be familiar with (variance) and define things that are obvious (e-mail survey). He veers from being cloyishly condescending (golly, doesn't ""operationalization"" have a lot of syllables!) to careening through complex calculations on reliability.His information in and of itself is valid, but frustratingly presented. Also, the dude is not nearly as funny as he thinks he is. He spends a lot of space making cutesy comments that could be better used to more fully explain concepts.Maybe future editions will be improved. These comments relate to the 2005 edition (which I believe is the first)."
2,Epic? I don't think so...,"I don't understand all these people who are raving over ES Posthumus like they're amazing gods of music. Each track consists of literally a melody that is repeated throughout the song in almost the exact same way. It's as if they just copy and pasted the melodies, then threw in some different instruments, pretending that this justifies the length of each song. If they had shortened the song, the repetition would be minimized as a result, leading to a more interesting album. If I had to recommend this album to anyone, it would probably be to people who are just getting into the 'epic music' genre and are transitioning from hip-hop. For those who are long-time epic music fans, you have better options like Audiomachine, Two Steps From Hell, and Immediate Music."
4,Something else,I was looking for a different type of music and decided to give this a listen.It is very intense and something I can enjoy for a long time.
5,E. S. Posthumus,I love this CD and it has great music. I got it in plenty of time and I want to buy another CD just like it when I get the chance.
3,"Once it works, it's wonderful","Being able to adapt a V400 to Bluetooth is wonderful. However, these adapters are mass-produced in China (check the packaging to confirm) and do not always work out of the box. This happened to a friend of mine, and then it happened to me. It will APPEAR to be in pairing mode but not link with a headset -- and I tested the phones and headsets on other devices to confirm this.So it's a great idea, and it works well -- ONCE IT WORKS. Be prepared to exchange this product; so far two out of four didn't work!"
2,Great Concept... lacks in implementation...,"Okay, I love my bluetooth enabled PDA/Phone combination... it's just a little too clunky to be bringing it to places like the mall, or the like, so I have a barebones cellie to use for just that situation. Since I have the bluetooth headset, I decided to buy the adapter for my Motorola V300 phone. It worked fine, it does what says it's supposed to do, wireless headset connectivity.It works, it does exactly what the box says with audio and data, but when using audio, it's a bit shoddy. The sound isn't clear like with my PDA, and the attachment gets in the way all the time. Overall, it serves it's purpose, it does what it needs to do, not very well implemented, and a bit shoddy in quality. I expected a little more from Motorola."
1,Nextel I-series cell phone owners beware!!,"Unfortunately, someone forgot to put in the product description the fact that this adapter DOES NOT FIT ALL MOTOROLA PHONES. I have no idea if it works because the thing wouldn't even plug into my I315 phone. Will think a little harder next time I may want to order ANY electronics from Amazon or Motorola. The tiny bit of money saved isn't worth the headache I've gotten trying to figure out exactly what adapter it's going to take. I recommend buyers go straight to the source and maybe THEY can tell you if the thing will even fit your phone."
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars] Good natured lighthearted fun with vet actors and 'Tardy Boys', the Barbarian Bros.","Cute little yarn about Barbarian Bros., lovablemuscleheads who dirve truck for Richard 'Bull'Moll of nightcourt fame. Ari Meyers hitches a rideto try to save kidnapped boyfriend being held byevil (get this!) Martin Mull! Dave Carradine playspsycho repo man, in one of his funniest roles sinceSafari 3000. Good showing by everybody and they allwatch their language well in here for PG-13 rating.Followed up with sorry R rated sequel 'Double Trouble'."
3,"Nice product, not sure how useful it is.","The vest seems nicely made. I took it on my first trip with my two year old g'daughter thinking it would hold her on my lap for safety and curtesy to seat mates. I did not use it as the first flight progressed because the flight was very calm and she was not restless. On the way home, I had accidently packed it in my checked bag,,, did not realize that until I had checked it."
2,"I did not even use it, though we had it available.","When I bought this item, I felt that I needed to safely restrain my infant while flying. The product description said that it should not be used for take-off or landing. Those were the times that I needed it most, so I didn't use it at all."
3,Not what I expected,The product looked well made but I didn't understand the correct usage for the product before I purchased it. I thought this product was a similiar one approved by the airline industry for toddlers to wear in thier own seats instead of using a carseat. The vests are to be worn only on an adult's lap and CAN'T be used during takeoff and landings. I was looking for a product that would keep them safe during takeoffs and landings. I sent the products back for a refund.
4,A must have for flying,"Its tough to rate a essential safety item, it should be 5 star regardless. This vest I just used is far superior to those provided by international airlines. You need practice to put it on and off your little angel, don't wait till your sitting on the plane to try it. Buckles could be less bulky for a comfortable sleep on your lap. But this harness I do love and I can even snooze knowing my baby/toddler can sleep quite securely."
3,I was not able to use it,I bought it but Air France and Iberia did not allow me to use it with my 5 month baby......
1,"Not neccesary, you won't be able to use it on the plane.","I bought this product in anticipation to our first flight with our infant son. We didn't purchase a ticket for him, but was bringing him on as a lap child. Being the over-cautious mom that I am, I totally fell for this, hook, line and sinker. If I was truly worried about my baby's safety, this product would not protect him. We brought our car seat with us and 2 out of the four connecting flights we were able to use it when there was a seat available. The other 2 times I just held him in my lap.The product clearly states on the packaging, that you are not allowed to use it during take offs and landings. Probably the only two times you might really need it. I would say if you are really concerned about the safety of your child, purchase him/her a seat. Or bring your car seat on the chance that you might be able to use it."
4,"Works well, but may not be necessary.","This is useful on Domestic (U.S.) flights, but on International flights we found that the airplanes came stocked with extra toddler seat belts (which also work as extenders) that go around the waist. Not quite as secure as the Vest, but it does almost as well and is a bit less confining than the Vest. A good investment if you plan to fly a lot with a toddler (under age 2) but for one-time travel you may want to borrow from a friend, or use an airline-provided belt."
3,"No complaint about product, but hardly used it on our flight.","The product is made well. I have no complaints about the Baby B'Air Toddler Flight Vest. I wish you could use it on take off and landing, but you are not supposed to do so. That is an FAA limitation, not the fault of Baby B'Air. We did hit some turbulence on our flight across the country to California, and we put it on our 11 month old then. However, for most of the trip, our baby wanted to face us, and the way this vest is designed, the baby sits in your lap, facing away from you. I would bring it with us again on future flights to put on her when the pilot announces that there will be turbulence, but she probably won't wear it if there is smooth flying."
5,xtra safety & comfort,Extra safety & comfort for the 1yo. Better than the belt the airline provides. Much better.
2,Not FAA certified for any phase of flight,"Purchasers should be aware that this product is not certified by the FAA for take-off, landing OR TURBULENCE. It is not certified by the FAA in any way."
1,"Not Approved for Taxi, Take Off and Landing","I'm a flight attendant for a major airline in the US and this type of device, or any device that tethers the child to the care giver, is not approved by the FAA. Flight attendants are supposed to ask parents to disconnect child until the cruise portion of the flight. I would not advise anyone to waste money on a product that cannot be used during the most dangerous parts of the flight. As a parent and a flight attendant I think that it's safest to have the child in his or her own seat with an approved child restraint device (CRD), such as a car seat with harness or a CARES harness."
3,Flight vest,"This seems like a good idea in theory, but I couldn't keep my wiggly 7 month-old still while on my lap during a recent 2-hour flight. He didn't like having to face forward the whole flight. I guess I can try it again but I was kind of disappointed."
1,Useless,"You can not use it during takeoff or landing. Even when you can use it, there is so much slack that there is not point. One slight dive of the child, and they would be hanging off your lap. Yes, they wouldn't land on the floor, but their head would have already smacked against the seat in front of them, and they would just be dangling there."
2,Confusing...,"The idea is great, but airline will not allow you to have it on during take off and landings when you feel like you most likely want it. When everyone else is allowed to take off their seatbelts, that is when you are allowed to put the baby be air on? Strange. Only used once."
1,NOT allowed on planes by FAA,"I was about to purchase this item since it seems like a good safety device for my son, whom is flying as a lap baby. I just called the airline (AA) and any harness that straps the child is NOT allowed on the plane, as per the FAA, so do not bother buying it."
1,False Security (I'm an ex-Flight Attendant),"This product does nothing to protect your child if anything goes wrong. It is basically just something for turbulence. The only way to fly safely is to have the child in a car seat and to strap it into a seat. There is no alternative.Never have your child in this for take-off and landing. Your weight could come down on the baby in forward impact. Their site implys that this product will be approved but that is not the case. They also claim that it meets some sort of FAA standard, which don't exist.A good baby carrier will do EXACTLY the same thing."
5,This is a good fan,This is a good fan if you whut to keep your computer or other stuff cool it is loud but it is a great product this is the best fan you can get out there have a great day.
5,GO DAVID SEDARIS!,"I received an audio book as a birthday present and it sat on my shelf for five years! I had never heard of David Sedaris. Now I am hooked. I have listened to four books total so far. My only dislike, is when they throw in a chapter or two of Davis reading out loud to an audience and the sound is distand and you hear the crowd laughing. Other than that, he is hysterical!"
1,With Purposely Blurred Genitalia and Carefully Discrete Angle Shots...,"With purposely blurred genitalia and carefully discrete angle shots, this movie simply brought on the urge to string up the video editor by the balls...a visual tease through and through. The only thing that makes this movie barely watchable are the models are still very beautiful, just one of few traits this flick has in common with other Penthouse videos."
3,"Not bad, but could have been better","There really are only 4 scenes in this DVD, not the 6 claimed. Two are two boy/girl scenes and the other two are girl/girl. The models (guys and girls) are all attractive, and the activities may be real, but the video could have been much better. The first boy/girl scene is the best of the 4 by far. The other b/g is pretty good also. The 2 g/g scenes are rather dull."
2,An okay first book.,"The strength of this first book was the depiction of the locale. The characters, particularly Tal, June and Henry had some interesting points but could have been much stronger. A major weakness was that I figured out the killer relatively early on. But, I didn't figure out the motive, so a definite point there. Overall, it was a good first book but I'll hope to see great improvement with the second book."
2,Sounds as if she's talking to a first-grader,"This book sounded at first as if it were designed for me--for someone with ADHD who has trouble getting rid of clutter. But the tone was so condescending and painfully patronizing I couldn't bear it. Why all the CAPITAL LETTERS? Afraid I WON'T UNDERSTAND? I'm attention-deficit--not STUPID. I felt like I was in KINDERGARTEN. There are some decent tips buried in here, but with all the obnoxious little names like Nancy Neatfreak and pretend aliens, you may want to knock the author in the head before you get to them."
2,"Okay, but then what?","This book is about the psychology of things - how and why we acquire then, how and why we organize them - or not, and how and why we do or do not discard things.The author suggests an approach to acquisition, organization and de-acquisition.Fine. I figured a few things out about my psychology. Get fewer things. Throw more things away. But - the middle step - the organization - is what I'm clueless about.This book offers few if any concrete hints for organization. Evidently the psychological insight alone is supposed to get you through. Uh, no.I wish I could return this book. I read it in one night and now it's just another thing to organize."
5,WAY BEST!,"This is by far the most useful book on decluttering I've read. It gets right down into your heart and helps you sort out what you find there. It doesn't tell you what products to buy, but helps you understand what blips in your brain chemistry or psychology may be contributing to the clutter problem, and suggests specific strategies for dealing with the various reasons."
5,Making Peace with the Things in Your Life,"This is the most insightful and helpful book on decluttering yet. I've read many how-to books but this book actually gets to your relationship with things, and gives you practical straregies to help over come our problem with things. Fantastic read."
1,Wow. Not worth the money.,"I read this book with high hopes. There were a few helpful suggestions if you truly have no idea how to get yourself out from under a mess of ""things."" But this book does NOT go into the depth I'd hoped, providing any sort of insight into why things are overwhelming for the typical person (as in, one who is NOT a hoarder). I also found the name assignment--""Sandy Makeit"" the crafter; ""Sally Gatherer"" the hoarder--pedantic and foolishly silly, ultimately undermining the goal of the book. I'm so not impressed."
1,Total loss,"This book may be the most pointless waste of time I've ever read. I blame myself for continuing to read it on the premise that ""it can't stay this stupid throughout."" It did, at least until I gave up.This book is not about reconciling the dialectic between materialism and asceticism. It is not even about how to organize your possessions. It is a collection of trite observations along the lines of ""Some Things seem to accumulate in piles."" Yep, that's as deep as it gets. Add to that some of the most sophomoric and even offensive propositions from the cesspool of pop psychology, such as a definition of autism as ""staring at Things for a long time,"" and you will have a clear understanding of this book without bothering to read it. Move on, pilgrim, before you sink into this vapid quicksand."
3,Review for island of flowers,"A young woman travels to Hawaii to visit her father that she has not seen in 15 years since her parents divorced, her mother kept her secluded in Paris. Meets dad's business partner, falls in love crosses many obstacles. Romantic adventure for anyone who has experienced and conquered life's problems."
2,Estranged Child Renews Parental Contact,A somewhat overworked plot: A child of divorce locates her long-lost father only to discover her recently deceased mother withheld the letters and attempts of the father to remain in touch. Not a very engaging plot.
3,nice shirt,Great looking shirt. I would not recommend drying it in the dryer. It shrank slightly....enough to be uncomfortable to my husband.
2,A terribly boring examination of a fascinating figure,"The topic of Deng Xiaoping's legacy is really fascinating, however this book really fails to engage the reader in any interesting way. This book is very dry and academic, and although there is a ton of information in here, the author fails to create a compelling narrative to tie it all together."
1,Disaappointing,Recording Engineer took unrealistic liberties with his high-tech level controls when recording. Low-levels by composer are exagerated and cannot be heard when volume control is set for normal listening of everything else.Very disappointing.
2,Poorly engineered,I must agree with Richard Keefer - the sound engineers have taken a silk purse and turned it into a sow's ear. What a pity!
5,"Another ""new"" work by Ferde Grofe!","The close of the last century was a good time for the late American composer Ferde Grofe, with two never-before-recorded works popping up on CD! I refer to ""Broadway at Night,"" recorded by the Beau Hunks, and ""Niagra Falls Suite,"" the last and best performed of the three suites featured on this CD.The sound quality is quite good, with a sufficiently spacious balance. While the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra's versions of the ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Mississippi"" suites are merely competent, its dramatic and robust presentation of ""Niagra"" is an unforgettable listening experience. The piece is great escapist fare, mild in intent but brilliantly written and orchestrated. The asking price amounts to a giveaway, so don't miss out on this one!"
2,SF Niner shirt,"I love the Niners, but this t shirt is of poor quality. The material is very thin. (And they run small) so if you get one, get the next size up."
5,Must have for any 49er's fan,This is one of my favorite shirts. I wear it all the time. It's comfortable and lightweight. I love wearing it!
1,NO-GO ON THESE BARS,"The package looks appealing, but the tiny bars have a tiny taste, stay away from these.Would never think of purchasing the likes again"
5,So very beautiful and inspiring,"I have always had an ""outside looking in"" fascination with Our Lady's Office.It attracts me more than an any book of hours. Probably because I have a deepand abiding sinner's love for Our Blessed Lady.This book takes you through the Little Office and accompanying devotional,practical and mystical elucidations follow throughout. Written by a holy nunin 1954 who seems a saint and a scholar. I am so edified by this book and lookforward to better praying and not just saying the Little Office.Christopher Cleveland"
1,Piece of Junk,"Received RecZone Laptop Poker [Laptop Touchscreen Poker]for Xmas. When plugged in, the whole thing would not stop blinking. Returned item for exchange. Received new item to find it not only blinked constantly, when it timed out, it would not restart without unplugging and jiggling cord, thus losing existing score. When it tried to pay out higher amounts, it stuck unless you kept pressing the deal/draw button. Finally having to return for a refund, as they are cute, but nothing but junk."
1,laptop video poker,The laptop video poker game was sent to us with Instructions and a car adapter missing. Once plugged in to play the game the display had missing numbers and or the card letters. Trying to return the item the sellers street address was incorect.The seller has not contacted me yet for a complete refund.I do not recommend this seller to anyone.I am seeking Amazon's help.Touch Screen Travel (Laptop) Poker
1,Piece of Junk,"Do not waste your time or money on this game. It is a piece of junk. It does not work correctly, for example: if you bet 50 and win (say with a high pair) you should get your 50 back plus 50. But you just get your 50 back. Unless you are extremely lucky, you will never win this game. It has no on/off switch (it shuts off after two minutes of no use, not good if your using batteries). Battery life is extremely limited as the game uses too much energy. No real instructions or manual explaining the games or odds, just a tiny fold out pamphlet. The company website has the wrong manual listed under downloads for this game. Overall a PIECE OF JUNK!"
5,Good buy!,"Not sure about the educational value, but this game is a lot of fun if you enjoy poker! Light weight, folds flat, easy to read screen...have owned (and played) this game for several weeks and have experienced no problems with the ""toy""."
4,really good sound,The sound on these discs is great. The images of the soloists and orchestra are sharply captured. The playing of the soloist and the orchestra had no obvious defect as well. However the overall product of the effort is not my favorite. Mutter/Karajan might be preferrable although the orchestra there is somewhat heavy. edit: see my review of Lin and Leppard (Concertos 1 & 4 on Sony).
2,No thank you,"This story of a thirteen year old fatherless boy has three main issues: a bully at school, a beautiful girl, and a brother with Asperger's Syndrome. The storyline pertaining to the bully and the crush are overly typical. The relationship between Alex and his brother is what could set this book apart from other young adult literature, but the portrayal of the main character leaves much to be desired. Instead of concentrating on what it's like being the sibling of an ""Aspie"", more attention is focused on the other aspects of the storyline. While this book could be appreciated by an ambitious young reader, a teenager is not going to identify with the characters."
3,A rather interesting story-line.,"This is not your usual one-plot story, instead it is a collection of short stories about children who have magical adventures. I think the one called ""Justnowland"" is the best one but there are some really good ones. Anyone who likes Narnia or Middle Earth will enjoy this, I think."
4,Amazing,This book is amazing it's the first time I read on my kindle foreign like how it has different storys
4,Quite good.,"This one is sort of variable. Some of the stories were wonderful, while others did not hook me. That being said, anything Nesbit does is well-written and interesting. Especially as they were written in the early 1900s!"
2,Great stories but e book badly formatted for the price,This e book is really badly formatted and you can get the same stories for half the price by other publishers so check what your buying.
2,fast book,"i rated this book 2 stars because it went to fast for me. for example, the first story ""the cat-hood of maurice"" the only things i got out of the story were that he turned into a cat then by the cat then got turned back into a human at the end by the same cat. my suggestion is that if you are the kinda of person who like stories were they speak old english and make you read fast so you have to keep your self at a steady pace this is the book for you."
2,fast book (revised),"I rated this book 2 stars because it went to fast for me. for example, the first story ""the cat-hood of Maurice"" the only things I got out of the story were that he turned into a cat then by the cat then got turned back into a human at the end by the same cat. My suggestion is that if you are the kind of person who like stories was they speak old English and make you read fast so you have to keep your self at a steady pace this is the book for you."
2,"""White"" is Bland","There must be something missing in the translation. This film of alleged deceit and revenge is neither interesting or erotic. It's just plain boring. The film starts out fairly promisingly but just lumbers along from there on out. I was a fan of director Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Red"" but this film is not as remotely excellent as that film. Haven't seen ""Blue"" yet but it can't be any worse than ""White""."
2,overrated,"Only just got around to watching this after hearing years of raves for ""White"". In a word: overrated. Slight comedy. Others say symbolism. More like cheap and obvious. The whole motivation behind this tale of revenge is unbelievable and contrived. Go on to ""Blue"" and ""Red"" for rewarding viewing."
5,Fade to Dream,"Excellent! This film begins with harsh reality, progresses to a harsher reality, and then devolves into surrealism. The final scene is one of the most unexpected and disturbing in all film. Keep watching until the end and then ask yourself: ""Was it a dream, or a nightmare; and who was doing the dreaming, Karol or his wife?"""
4,Wonderful performance by Julie Delpy,"Delpy's performance in ""White"" is one of the best of her career, perhaps only eclipsed by her role in ""Before Sunrise"". If her performance isin fact more impressive than the one she gave in ""Sunrise"", it's because, unlike ""Sunrise"", she has such limited time to establish her character, Dominique. Delpy's difficult job is to find some small dose of sympathy in the hatefuly vengeful character she plays.There is a very brief moment where Karol tickles Dominique with her hair while she is in the middle of throwing him out. For a very brief moment Dominique's cold exterior melts and we see the beautiful young woman that Karol fell in love with.This picture is recomended if, for no other reason, than to see Delpy's brilliant performance."
2,Ah..... huh??,"What the ----. ""A tale of revenge""? Why does everyone in their review say that? B/c it's written on the box cover?? This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the ""REWIND"" button and saying, ""what a minute, is it OVER?? Did I miss something??""Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film. My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven); he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married. ??????How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film? Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about. It was NOT about revenge. Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.Sorry, can't really recommend this one!!"
2,Not the Originals,I was thinking about getting this collectionuntil I heard the samples. These songs are re-recordings!
1,Does not do justice to Ray Price,This CD just doesn't have the quality it should. Some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as Danny Boy. I have the Cassette and it was great but this just doesn't do justice to Ray Price or his songs.
1,"I agree with, ""Don't buy this item.""","The quality is not there and as said in previous review, do not try to ""chop up"" a classic. For someone who wants a wonderful Ray Price assortment, true to the LP arrangements but on CD, you might consider a 3 disc collection from: www.timelessmusic.com which is a lot more Ray Price for the same money. It is a Sony product and has chrystal clear sound. I have been a Ray Price fan since ""Night Life"" and this album is not up to his standards. That is just my opinion."
2,Clipping Service?,"The book is mainly a paste-up of Times articles published during the election. While this was of course first-class reporting, the book offers very little new analysis or other fresh material. If you read the Times regularly during the election crises, you have already read most of this book; others will be left reading six month-old newspaper articles."
3,Wolves CD,"Loved the sound of the wind in this CD, & agree w/ other reviewers that this company should make a CD of ""wind sounds."" If you want a CD to relax to while sitting in a chair, then this should be a good choice. However, if you are buying this CD to listen to as you fall asleep (as I did), then you're making the wrong choice. There is one howl where the wolf apparently comes close to the microphone, & the volume of his howl is loud enough to wake you up. This howl is looped into the CD in several places. Also, being an avid outdooresman that (many a time) has fallen asleep to the distant howl of coyotes in the Rockies, there is a good bit of looping in this CD. The exact same howls are repeated several times throughout the CD. For that reason + the lone howl at too high a volume for falling asleep, I only gave it 3 stars."
3,Needs tracks,"I bought this to try to get my husky to howl. I just wanted wolves howling, without music. It's mostly howling, but it also has very subtle music at times. I also found myself having to fast forward alot because I would get to a good part, and upon rewinding accidentally bump the button again to go to the beginning. I was sometimes a half hour in! annoying.It's not bad if you don't mind the music and lack of tracks."
2,Not a good book,"This book is really a stylistic overview of different stairs.It doesn't measure up to Birkhauser's Construction Manual Series. The 'Case Study Section'(the body of the book)is almost worthless from a technical point of view. You will find many obvious statements used to describe what you can already see in photographs. You will find precious little ""behind the scenes"" nuts and bolts discussion here. The price of the book in combination with the contents of the book calls to mind the word: ""Hoax."""
3,Not Quite What I Thought It Was - But Is A Good Documentary,"The DVD is not quite what I thought it was - but it is a good documentary. For whatever reason, I assumed that this would a movie/story based on the DVD title/theme. Instead it is more like a talking point. I must say that it was rather informative for me and it reinforced some thoughts I've had about the slave culture in those times."
4,Informative,"This video was an eye opening experience, it definitely answers alot of questions we all have in the back of our minds but were afraid to ask."
3,HP 935 Experiences,"I have owned this camera for approximately 2 1/2 years, and my experience has been very frustrating. Rarely do I get a good picture when using the zoom (very noisy). I have also experienced many problems with taking pictures indoors, and in low light. The most frustrating problem is that I can take multiple photos of the same scene with the same settings and get different results (some light, some dark, contrast inconsistencies, color inconsistencies). I have also experienced the battery drain problems that other reviewers have reported, but have had great results using Lithium batteries. About have the time, the camera gods smile, and the camera takes a great picture, but I've lossed two many precious moments to take another chance. Time to get a new camera."
1,very poor quality,"I was initially wowed by how great the photos were, but the camera has a faulty battery reader - it was intermittantly shutting down when the batteries still had charge, and the battery reading varied wildly. I coudn't get HP's tech support to believe me - they had me do elaborate testing and because the problem was intermittant, I didn't get the right results. I got tired of waiting for them to call back & thought heck, I'll just make sure to carry extra batteries, I can live with this. The warranty expired last month, and weeks later something failed in the zoom lense - it will no longer focus and makes an awful whirring noise when turned on an off. HP is not a camera company - I'm getting a Cannon this time, but this was an extraordinary expense for a year's worth of use. HP is not the quality company it once was!"
5,"excellent camera, easy to use, great battery life","im 15 years old and been taking pics most of my life. i bought this camera at Target for $300 and have been happy ever since. i use NiMH rechargeable batteries with 2100 mAh. there the best rechargable batteries ive had. i got 134 pictures using the flash and lcd screen for most of them(hint: only use the screen when your taking pics, dont have it on the entire time). the best part is the Auto feature it has, all i do is point and shoot, the camera chooses the best settings for the enviroment your in. you can use manual controls which i only use some of the time. the flash is a little slow, it takes about 2 secs to flash and take the picture. this camera takes awesome pics and when i show them to people, they're amazed and ask me what kind of camera it is."
5,Very good Camera,"An awsome camera. The only bad thing about it is, it drains batteries very quickly when using the live view. Make sure to buy a more memory for it. The 32 meg that comes with it holds less then 16 pictures on the best quilty."
2,Good camera but is a battery hog!!,Have had this camera for about 7 years. Works well for me but eats batteries like a hungry dog! Would not have purchased it if I had known about this problem.
1,Camera broken twice,"I've had this camera for maybe 18 months. It broke once-- pictures hopelessly blurry, NOT user error-- and HP sent me a new one. The second one is now broken-- the lens is retracted and won't extend-- and now I'm stuck because it's out of warranty and HP won't even repair it at my expense. When it did work, it sucked batteries like crazy. Do yourself a favor and find another brand."
2,HP sets a new standard in substandard technical assistance,"This is a really great camera, but just try and call HP tecnical or customer service to ask about upgrades, and you will be sent from incoherent message to incoherent message without access to a human being to answer questions. I cannot believe HP would put a product on the market and walk away from their customers!"
2,"Oh, the battery life","I got the 935 at Staples, who claimed that it came withrechargable batteries. It didn't. They were 1.5v lithiums,not rechargeable.It's a nice camera, but 2 1800 mah cells last about 20minutes, no matter what you do. These are good cells, butthis thing eats electricity like General Motors.Hard to believe that HP would produce such a thing. I'msticking with my 1-2 megapixels cameras.Then again, it might be defective. Of course, for $50, you can buy an AC pack that you can take with you on a long expeditionin the veldt, with a long extension cord.Good lord, how could a company drop the ball so wonderfully????And Hewlett Packard.Jerry O'Dell"
1,very poor chose,"This was my first experience with a digital camera. I had heard great things about digital cameras and thought that I would invest in a good camera. I was dead wrong.I totally soured on digital after using this camera. I have invested countless dollors in batteries, sd cards, and other accesories.Can only use this camera for 2-3 pictures even without a flash before batteries go dead.The recharger does not work, we cannot use it at all. It takes 1-2 minutes of warm up time before it even turns on. Then is only good for 2-3 pictures.I THINK THAT IT MUST EAT BATTERIES OR SOMETHING.WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK."
4,WONDERS NEVER DO CEASE,"Once again the adage that wonders never cease is proven. This time by a fine bit of paper engineering enclosed between small covers (4 "" by 5 "").The seven mysteries, which include Atlantis, the Bermuda Triangle, Easter Island, the Egyptian Labyrinth, the Nasca Lines, Shangri-La, and Stonehenge, are each introduced by a concise yet complete text that provides appropriate background information.Shangri-La, known in fable as a paradise on earth, emerges from a bank of puffy clouds. Yet, of all the three dimensional illustrations, perhaps the Egyptian Labyrinth is the most fascinating with its pillars reflecting the intricate colorful art of the Twelfth Dynasty.- Gail Cooke"
5,The 5.1 System Bose Should be Making,"Bose is marketing their products wrong and I can see why so many people don't like them. The Lifestyle and Acoustimass systems are overpriced and don't do the job. Solution: Front L/R speakers = Bose 301. Center = Bose VCS-10. Surround L/R = Bose cube speakers (come with Lifestyle and Acoustimass systems, but if you call Bose tech support, you can order then separately... or eBay). Subwoofer = Polk Audio PSW110 with the crossover set at around 90hz. Sorry Bose, your subs are no good. Amplifier = Yamaha HTR-5940 (read the manual and set it up right!). This is what Bose should be selling. It sounds AMAZING!"
2,Rangered,"There's a reason that Bose doesn't disclose the stats on their speakers. It's because they are very inefficient and basically only reproduce the middle range (in a muddy fashion). I sold my VCS-10 after 2 weeks and replaced it with a Klipsch..WHAT A DIFFERENCE! It was only $50 more, but is a light year better. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk, it will disappoint you."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Like everyone else has said, this thing is a waste of money. I have had mine for 3 years now and have not once been able to hear the actors speaking during a movie. I thought it was my tuner, but it must be this piece of garbage"
1,Don't be fooled,"I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed. The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this. No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not high end. After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable. Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all. Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth."
3,It fits--that's it,"I bought this to fit on top of my Sony 50-inch screen. It fits (with help from Velcro to stabilize it). It takes a while before you realize how limited the frequency range--AND how critical it is. I thought since center channels basically carry dialogue why worry about the crash of cymbals resonating. Wrong. A soung engineer who lives in the buildingchuckled when he said ""Bose--no highs, no lows"" Turns out that's an sound industry joke. The speaker looks great and the sound is clear. In retrospect, had it been less expensive I wouldn't be so tweaked. It's not good enough to really be happy with it, but not bad enough to replace it. I'll wait for some divine intervention."
2,"Ok, but definetely showing its age and not for me.","I like the styling of the speaker, however it just does not have any range. It would be good for a very basic system. I have a pretty serious system and I had to cut the fronts down (Klipsch) to +5 and leave the center at +12 just to hear without issue.. It is not that it is not a good speaker - it sounds good - it just cannot keep up with my surround sound system. The delivery of it was fantastic - however I knew I was sending it back the same day. I have no problem with BOSE - just this speaker is showing its age - it has been around and not modified for around 10 years.."
2,"Small, neat design, but very poor sound quality.","I have a question for those people that rated this item with 5 stars: did it get 5 stars because sound came out of it when you hooked it up, or did you actually compare it to ANY other speakers?? Yes, it has a small, neat design, but it sounds bad. Try comparing this speaker before you buy and I guarantee you'll immediately see what I mean. The Bose VCS-10 sounds so much worse than even the cheapest ($50) bookshelf speaker you can pick up from any of your local stores. The center channel is such an important part of your surround-sound system - I wouldn't even use this in the $30 Kmart all-in-one surround-sound system. If you want something that looks pretty, buy a nice ornament and put it on top of a decent-sounding center-channel speaker :-)"
3,"Sounds good, but not nearly good enough-- for the price.",It's not bad. But for $200? No way! Get this speaker instead. I don't think Bose is all that great. You can always find better speakers for a better price.Infinity Classia CC225BK Two-Way Center Channel Speaker (High Gloss Black)
5,Great Speaker for the Intermediate Enthusiast,"I just received this speaker as a gift. I am extremely pleased with this product. Most who complain about this products clarity are looking for flashy sounds such as those associated with accentuated bass and/or treble frequencies. While those sounds may be initially attractive to the novice, they are not real and not enduring like the Bose Center Speaker. The reviewer above sounds like this type of person. None compares to this for the price. In addition, you can find it on sale too from time to time."
4,Good quality!,"I believe it is a very good product, even though you cannot find it in the store anymore. Good price, good quality as well!"
5,awsome speaker,great speaker that will enhance any surround sound system. This speaker can be places anywhere in the room and still deliver that perfect clear center speaker quality sound that is expected and demanded by bose quality.
5,Center speaker 5:1,Much higher quality that the small center speaker that came with my stereo system. As the center channel provides most of the sound it was a worthwhile investment to buy this speaker from Bose.
4,Better than it's reputation!,"I almost didn't order this based on the poor reviews and Consumers Reports findings. I needed a thin center speaker to go with the acoustimass cubes - this was the logical choice. After researching it at length there were mixed reviews with many negative comments. I called Cruthfield and the Bose Outlet to get their opinions. They were surprised to hear that there were negative comments. The Bose outlet advised theirs sounded great and noted it must be hooked directly to the receiver - not the module like the cubes. I have had the speaker for a couple weeks and it sounds great. I have two other surround systems, one high end and a lower end system and the Bose performs admirably for such a compact system. The articulation of words coming from the center speaker sounds like a real person. I don't understand the bad reviews - unless it's not being connected properly. Worked for me - and as most retailers note you can always send it back."
5,Made a huge improvement in my system,"I've had the Bose Acoustimass system for 6 years and have been using a 5th cube for the center channel. I purchased a new home theater cabinet for Christmas and decided that the center cube wasn't visually appealing so I purchased the center channel speaker strictly for its appearance. I wasn't expecting the speaker to make much difference in the sound of my system but, when I turned the system on WOW what a difference it made. The surround separation is 50% better and the center channel is much more clear. Well worth the money.I ordered through Amazon and received the speaker from 6Ave in two days."
1,These sound terrible. Bottom of the list in independent tests,"Consumer Reports placed these at the bottom of the list of one of their recent center channel speaker comparisons, and I COULD NOT AGREE MORE. Lower costing speakers performed far better. In some calculated tests of my own, I found these had far less range and ""presence"" than other major brand speakers. I have a Yamaha NS-C444 speaker that provides full, lifelike sound, and handles plenty of power.This Bose center channel speaker was a major disappointment, and far from representative of their generally outstanding audio components."
2,Worse than $60 Yamaha center speaker,"I was thinking about this center speaker since seems this is the only one can be put onn the top of my Sony LCD rear projection TV but since read so many bad reviews here I decided to try one from CircuitCity.Installed tonight and watching movies ""Collateral"". A lot of talking in the Cab but I can't hear clearly. I tune my receiver for a long time but only I can turn the volume very lound that I can hear the talking clearly but backgroud music is too lound.Tried my Yamaha speaker bought from Bestbuy for $60 and wow... All I want to do is packing the Bose speaker and return it to the store.Bose makes some good speakers but not this."
2,Average Sound,"I just purchased the VCS-10 to replace my outdated (or so I thought) Polk Center. Boy was I in for a surprise! The VCS-10 sounded worse than my 7yr old Polk. Thus, the VCS-10 got returned. I just purchased the Acoustic Research AR4C for less than the Bose, and it sounds great!"
2,weak sound,"I bought this primarily based on the BOSE reputation as well as the fact that it would sit nicely on top of the TV and fit in my stand.I could not have been more disapointed. I was replacing a KLH 3 way center channel, and the sound was not even close to that.The sound was weak, with little presence. After bringing up the center channel 12db and dropping the left and right channels -10db I could finally hear the dialogue from the center channel. I was not expecting bells and whistles, but I was expecting that I could actually hear the dialogue CLEARLY, and without a 22db difference in loudness between center and left/right."
5,Fantastic Read,"These Old Shades and Devils Cub are my two favorite books by Georgette Heyer. I love the witty conversation and the characters. If you like historical fiction, you will like these two books!"
2,"One of Ms. Heyer's earliest efforts, and not her best","On the Georgette Heyer reading list on the Internet, DEVIL'S CUB is consistently cited as one of the favourites by listmembers -- but it is one of my LEAST cherished Heyer books. The hero, the Marquis of Vidal, is not so much a rakehell as a spoiled brat who kills duelling opponents in fits of temper and attempts to rape the heroine (who manages to protect her own virtue by shooting him, thus winning his admiration and love!) Many Heyer fans seem to find such plot lines irresistibly romantic; for myself, I find this book and its hero rather repugnant. If you enjoyed THESE OLD SHADES, the ""prequel"" to this books, you'll love this one too -- but I find those Alastairs to be the least appealing among all of Ms. Heyer's characters."
3,Devil's Cub,"Devil's Cub is the sequel to These Old Shades and concerns the son of Justin and Leonine, Vidal. While These Old Shades is my second favorite Heyer, after Frederica, I was disturbed by the character of Vidal in Devil's Cub. At the book's beginning Heyer shows us two scenes from Vidal's life, in both of which Vidal kills a man (a highwayman and another aristocrat in an impromptu, drunken duel) with no regrets or even concern. Unlike his father in Shades, who is converted by love into being a better man than he thought possible, Vidal remains a spoiled, little boy on the inside. That his love interest likes that about him is unfortunate. I give this book 3-stars for the scenes with Justin, Duke of Avon, which are witty and wonderful. I just wish more of the father had found himself in the son."
4,Classic Heyer,"I admit, I didn't love this book the first time I read it.. After reading several more Heyer novels ( and noting that some of her secondary characters are infuriating) I re-read this one and really enjoyed it. I'm used to contemporary authors who use the secondary characters as an introduction to a future novel, but most of Heyer's books are stand-alones, so I can feel free to dislike them - they won't show up as heroes/heroines in another novel!I liked Mary from the beginning, but Vidal was harder to like, though eventually I came around. Nice, classic Heyer - worth re-reading!"
5,"Loved it, loved it, loved it","As a new fan of Georgette Heyer, I can't be more thrilled that I found her!! I've read Arabella, These Old Shades, Masqueraders, and Devil's Cub (this one being my favorite). So witty, lots of romantic tension, great plot (which others said lacked but I was pleased). I have no problem slipping into this era but bare in mind that is exactly what you must do to appreciate these books. Going into them with 21st century ideas will simply make them seem outdated with the male characters looking harsh and egotistical and the females looking all damsel in distress. Enjoy them for what they are in the era that they were written and you'll love them."
3,Devil's Cub,"This sequel to ""These Old Shades"" is a little thin on plot. Basically a series of chases as the heroine runs away from the man she loves, who abducted her in a fit of pique. She doesn't want to bring him down to her level by marrying him, although he's already a murderer, gambler, and quite likely an alcoholic with no self-control and extremely selfish and devoted to having his own way. Hmmmmm... Of course he's rich and handsome, which makes it all OK.I really like some Georgette Heyer books - ""The Unknown Ajax"" is very funny, ""The Reluctant Widow"" is witty and entertaining, ""The Toll-Gate,"" which is a thriller and very effective, and others with more likeable characters and more interesting plots. If you are new to Heyer, read some of her better books first before reading this one."
2,Irritating Characterizations,"This book was a big disappointment. My main criticism is that there is little reason for Mary, given the description of her character, to be in love with Vidal. The premise of the story was deeply flawed. It would have been different if he had been shown to have any redeeming qualities. The book would be much improved had there been some background on how his character became so selfish and indifferent to others along with examples of him showing glimpses of a good or interesting personality underneath the shallow and mean picture painted of his character.Also after reading These Old Shades, the prequel, I had hopes that Rupert's character, Vidal's uncle, might improve. Instead in this book he became unlikeable and unappealing. I could envision Rubert's character as originally written as the main character in this novel instead of Vidal.Some portions of this story reflected aspects of Georgette Heyer's stories that I enjoy. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
4,Bridget's Review,"Dominic has decided who wants to have as a lover. When he is exiled after losing a duel, he decides that he wants to take this woman with him. In the end, that woman's sister, Mary, comes between them. Mary is a strong woman who will bend to no man. She even shoots Dominic when he gets a little too comfortable with her. Soon, Dominic's family discovers that Mary is just what Dominic needs.This was a very fun book that perfect for an afternoon of relaxation."
3,Piano Machine,"Art of piano playing is all about how to make the instrument sing and breathe like a human. With all his artistry and technical polish, the piano still sounds like a machine under Pollini's hands. Not my kind of pianist."
4,Dracula's Parish Priest,"The third go around for Lee as dracula, but the fourth in the series, takes place from the end of ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" A priest and Monsignor make the treacherous journey to Castle Dracula to ward off the evil that lurks over the quiet village below, during the trek the two become seperated the monsignor places a large crucifix upon the door to seal in the evil. The priest, however,falls and bangs his head on the ice, dripping blood into the Count's frozen tomb. Dracula now reborn, unleashes his fury against the one who defiled his castle,with an intern ....wait, that's another horror story. the monsignor and his family are the prey. Some great action, a good story line and Christopher Lee. The ending is intense and abrupt. The only real complaint is it isn't widescreen"
5,vintage dracula,My favorite vintage Dracula flick. Story line is a bit different than the usual Van Helsing chasing Dracula plot. Christopher Lee is at his awesome best!
4,the many deaths of dracula,"first off let me say i love hammers dracula series. this the third in the series is in my view one of the better ones. the death of dracula in these movies were always the hi-lite of the film, and this movie has what i think is the best and most orignal.enjoy and watch out for big crosses"
4,Dracula has risen from the grave,"Dracula has risen from the grave. I found the storyline quite narrow,but it was still solid entertainment. It was the second Dracula hammer film that I had purchased and I enjoyed it very much."
3,just have a little faith!,"Nice entry in the long running Hammer films Dracula series. Although Peter Cushing is absent, Christopher Lee still sends shudders up your spine. In this film he is taking revenge on a Monsiegner who performed an exorcism on his Castle. The priest is foster father to his pretty niece, who becomes the target of Dracula's revenge. Dracula is aided by another cleric who has lost his way and fallen under the spell of Dracula. Some bawdy bedroom scenes would fetch this film a PG-13 today. Good film overall. This VHS release is not available in Widescreen. I could not find the film at all on Laserdisc. Perhaps it will be released on DVD in the future."
3,Religion goes Goth,"Religious symbolism romps through this installment of the Hammer Dracula cycle of films. And as the Brides of Dracula was hurt Lee not returning to do battle with Cushing, this film lacks the avenging presence of Cushing's Val Helsing. In John Elders script, Lee's character is even more one dimensional, continuing the trend Dracula Prince of Darkness did by giving Lee no dialog. Many of the scenes were shot through a red colour filter, which strangely falls flat, Freddie Francis direction offers a lot of evil, but just does not live up to promises. Veronica Carlson is beautiful, the music is great, but the whole movie starts the decline of the quality Hammer Vamps.Still, is a must for Lee - Dracula fans."
5,Classic Hammer Horror at it's Best,"This Hammer Dracula Film, the third with Christopher Lee is excellent. Full of atmosphere, Gothic touches and beautiful photography. This film will make some understand why to many Christopher Lee is the definitive Dracula. Excellent musical score too, a must-watch for any Horror fan, without a doubt one of Hammers best!"
1,worst of all hammers,"Dracula gets locked out of his house and is justifiably upset. Then follows 2 excruciating hours of boredom. The Dracula cycle was never as good as the hammer frankenstein cycle. Why? because Dracula never has anything interesting to do... always its vengeance against those who have awakened him, no plot, no cushing or morrel, horrible photography (unusual for hammer) and dismal, though doom laden score.And dracula is such a wimp too....."
2,LOOK INTO MY EYES,"THIS AN OK DRACULA FILM IN THE HAMMER SERIES,THE SUSPENCE IS NOT THAT GREAT AND THE ENDING IS PREDICTABLE.THE ONLY GOOD ACTING IN THE FILM COMES FROM CHRISTOPHER LEE WHILE THE OTHERS IN FILM ARE DECENT."
3,Third installment of the Hammer Dracula cycle.,"While the story line for this third installment of the Hammer Dracula saga is routine, the film is distinguished for its more than usually Gothic look, especially in the early mountain scenes and the clever use of matte paintings; this is thanks to the directorial work of Freddie Francis, who went on to win an Oscar as the cinematographer for Passage to India. Also adding to the film's overall gothic effect is the musical soundtrack by James Bernard, a more dissonant score than he normally delivered for Hammer. END"
4,Good outing for Hammer,"I have been a fan of Hammer films since I was a child growing up in a U.S. Air Force family. I remember seeing this movie at Anderson AFB, Guam back in the 70's. I loved it then as a child and appreciate the quality of the work now from a much different perspective as an adult. The film has the standard hard driving, ear jarring score associated with Hammer Horror and solid performances by all of the actors. Finally, I very much appreciate the quality of the conversion from Film to DVD. While I'm sure younger audiences may find this film to be ""cheesy"" by today's digital gore standards, I would respond by saying ""I saw Twilight....and it sucked."" Pun intended."
3,A Pain in the Neck!,"They just don't make'em like this anymore, do they? Corny acting but still fun to watch. Chris Lee did a great job as ""the man"" and I think he still had some of that ""power"" in that last Star Wars flick he was in!"
1,Almost DOA,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. My wife bought me one for Christmas this year. It played for about 5 minutes and died. I couldn't even get the disk out. I had to take it back for a refund and disk-removal. I guess this could happen with any brand, but I've never had a Sony, JVC, etc. die right out of the box on me."
4,So far so good,"I bought this player about a month ago. I have played about 5 DVDs so far and they have played perfectly. The sales person at the store I purchased it from said that many of the new discs are ""layered"" and that the inexpensive players didn't play them very well, but so far I've had no problems. I don't think you can beat this player considering the price."
5,"Great, basic machine","I just purchased this player as a first time DVD user, and I am more than pleased. The picture is perfect and the sound is amazing. For those who said that the video didn't play well, I am wondering if they tried hooking it in through a VCR, as that will mess up the picture (either no picture, or a picture that fades in and out). THIS IS EASILY REMEDIED.If you have an older TV, one with only a cable input and no video input jacks, you have to buy an RF Modulator (which the directions could have more clearly explained in my opinion), for about $30 at any (local store), in order to properly split the connection. This allows me full function of my two VCRs and my cable box along with the DVD player.The machine is easy to hook up, is lightweight and attractive, and works very well. The directions are a little unclear, but it is a great ""starter"" machine, especially for the money."
1,Lack of quality control at Apex,"I bought a few of these units a month ago and NONE of them worked from the start. Some would continuously close and open the DVD tray when plugged in asking for a disc; the rest would not even open the tray - all you could hear was constant clicking until they were unplugged. I got tired of going back and forth exchanging the unit. Besides, the guys at CC told me that most of the AD-1500 players come back to them sooner or later.It is such a waste to produce something that no one at the factory has time to power up and check. It would not take more than 15 seconds to do, save shipping costs across the world, and maybe it would even get them a few loyal customers in the long-run.I would be very reluctant to buy an Apex DVD now no matter what advanced or other great `hackable' features it might offer on paper. This unit sounds too good to be true, so when you buy it, make sure the store is close by, so you can easily return or exchange it..."
4,Possibly the best of the low cost players!,"This low cost dvd player does just about everything you could want a player to do. It will play dvd, cd, cd-r, cd-rw, vcd, svcd and mp3. How many other machines will do that for less than $100? The picture quality is great and the sound is good. It even comes with parent lock. People I know with this player love it, and people who don't have it wish they had waited and saved some money."
3,loud dvd player,"this dvd player is really loud,when i put a cd or a dvd disk in it sounds like the ground is shaking or something like that.if you want a good dvd player under 100 dollars go with a rca or something,not apex."
2,Low Priced and Cheap,"I bought the Apex AD1500 for a great price, and nine months later, it won't play any disks. Apex says it will fix the machine for [price] plus shipping. I can't get it fixed locally because Apex won't sell parts or service information to others.While it worked, it produced good entry level sound and picture. After all, digital is digital, but I'll never buy another Apex product again."
1,Broke after 10 minutes!,"I bought one of these at Circuit City. The video quality was mediocre. However, I had to return it because the disc tray was defective. When I put in a DVD it would either NOT close properly or would get stuck when I hit the open tray. Although the price and supposed hackability of this player can't be beat, I would NOT buy this player as your everyday DVD player."
1,not what it appears to be,I bought this item thinking it would at least function. Not.First it took the dvd and started to play it. Then it shut down and would not spit it out. I had to disconnect all wires and plug it into an outlet. Finally after 5 minutes and repeated open commands it spit the dvd out.I selected 3 new dvds and it did it to all of them.At least circuit city refunded my money to my credit card.
3,Fully valued.,"Despite the attractive pricing, this machine is certainly no bargain. I thought it might serve as an upstairs complement to the Panasonic DVD RV31K I have downstairs. But especially in the light of recent price drops on the latter machine, it's difficult to rationalize purchase of the Apex, even if it's currently in the same price range as inexpensive VCR's. The tray doesn't slide open: it opens with a loud scrape and thunk. The minimal on-site controls (4) practically force you to rely on the remote, which features the largest number of tiny buttons I've ever seen crammed onto a tiny surface area. Unless you have laser eyes and muchkin fingers, it's unlikely you'll be able to punch one button without hitting several others. If you factor in the cost of returning the unit along with the postage you might have saved on another machine, you'll probably realize, as I have, that in this case less is simply less."
4,MP3 compatibility,Will play MP3 off CDR. Random function is crippled. Will only play randomly from one folder. No display or use of enbedded MP3 header tags. Correctly decodes VBR MP3.Will not recognize MP3s burned to DVD.
2,Fix It?,"Here is a very useful link on how to ""JUST MAYBE"" fix your DVD player if it is Locking/Not Reading.Lots of Info here if you are willing to get your hands dirty!( http://www.nerd-out.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=117757#117757 )Here is some info I used:Update: I opened the player that locked up theworst in my earlier testing and found the trimmerpotentiometer that RickH described.As he said, it looks like a little phillipsscrew head (that appears to be made of whitenylon). You can't miss it on the power supplyboard. It's toward the outside of the case andseems to be marked on the board as RV(variable resistor?) and is to the right of R27.(A couple of inches to the right of the fuse.)1) Removed cover2) Turned the pot 1/8th turn counter-clockwise3) Thought it might be better set too low than too high4) Adjusted a micron more counter-clockwise5) Replaced cover.6) Enjoyed flawless, no-freeze playback!Goodluck Rick..."
4,An excellent DVD player for the money!,"I have this dvd player, and a Sony that I paid more than 3 times as much for.The Apex player is not as fancy as the Sony, but plays just as well. In fact the Apex plays many things that my Soney won't including VCD's!!I've had no problems with skipping, or warbling, and play purchased, rented, and net flix dvd's with it.The only thing that I don't like about this player is the remote. It's easy to use, and has your typical dvd player functions, but it is underpowered. You have to be pretty much dead in front of the player for it to work well. If you are off to the side more than a few feet it doesn't always pick up.But for the money you simply can't go wrong with this player. It's well worth it."
4,Good deal,When this dvd player came in I eagerly set it up and put in a dvd. I was a little worried because when i purchased the dvd player i read some negative reviews. However I have been very happy with the picture and the sound quality. A lot of people complained about the remote which comes with the player and i admit its not the best remote but it could be a lot worse. One of my favorite features is the MP3 capabilities it has. I burned a cd with over 120 mp3 songs on it and it played them with great sound quality. I would definately buy this dvd player because it is a great bargain.
4,"Good, basic DVD","Works really well with DVD, VCD, MP3, CD. Good Picture & sound. On the downside, it has a really weak remote and it has a lot of operating vibrations & sound. Still, you can't beat the price and it's a great second unit."
1,You'll regret this purchase if anything goes wrong,"I bought a similar ""value"" Apex DVD players from Amazon about six months ago. The thing had an annoying hum at times, but worked... at first. After two months it wouldn't play DVDs longer than maybe 90 minutes. I tried calling their service line - no one answered the phone. I went to their Website and wrote to their service e-mail address - I received no response, ever.My guess is they figure (rightly) that no one is going to go to a lot of legal trouble over a device that costs less than $100. There are other companies that make low-end DVD players and other equipment - patronize one of them instead of Apex."
2,It was good while it lasted,"Add me to the list of owners whose player died in the eighth month. What did they do, put time bombs in these things?At the current price I doubt it would be worth paying the labor and shipping charges to fix it. I'll probably throw it out and replace it with a game console or a better brand of player."
2,Almost plays everything.,"The good thing about this DVD player is that it plays just about every format you might want to play.The bad thing is that it doesn't play them very well. It works OK on new disks, but on the scratched disks ..., mine just plays distorted incomprehensible sound. Even on the 14"" TV it's connected to, MPEG artifacts are visible much of the time.... I bought the Apex AD1500 as a second DVD player, but the cost savings vs buying a second RV31K really aren't worthwhile.Summary: ... Spend just a little more and get something you'll be much happier with."
3,not bad...when it worked,"First unit was doa.Second unit worked for 4 months, then died. just out of warranty for labor. tech support was nice but still charged me labor.Great simple player and price cant be beat"
1,Poor Integrity,"I can not rate the perfomance of the product because it did not work, but I can tell your the construction is low quality. Problematic cd door that easily breaks or does not open. If you are going to buy this and not have it shipped (store pickup) and are gentle with it you may be ok."
2,works during warranty coverage...doesn't as soon as it ends,"APEX [is weak]!Not that you should expect much when paying such a small amount of money for such an electronic device, but it is frusterating. Mine lasted just beyond the termination of the warranty coverage and then completely stopped working. It worked great until that point, but now it would cost me more to fix it than to just buy a new one. Instead I'm going to invest a bit more money and purchase a quality dvd player.good luck..."
2,Issues with the player,"Unfortunately, the player had technical issues initially when opening the DVD/CD bay. I would not recommend this item. It does not play latest DVDs...and it has issues with some VCD formats."
4,Worth the Money,"This player is well worth the money, however for a few bucks more you can buy a better unit.This unit works very well for an inexpensive DVD that is used on occasion. It falls short in the following respects:1.) Although it plays perfect DVD's very well, it doesn't play them if they have slight damage. It will not play a DVD that plays without a problem on my Toshiba DVD player.2.) It does not have a universal remote. The included remote is ok but has limited function."
2,"worked okay 8 months, then died.","I had the same experience as most of the other reviewers who have owned this player for 6-8 months. I've had it eight months, and it worked fine for that time and I was satisfied with the performance. Then yesterday I tried to play a DVD and it was broken (nothing comes up on the small display and nothing plays). I thought it was a deal at the time I bought it, and I guess I got my moneys worth, but my next DVD player will not be an Apex."
1,Junk,"This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. The first one I purchased stopped working. I bought another. The tray door broke. I returned it, and this replacement also broke. Three out of three broken days after purchase, not a good record. I have bought a Phillips DVD623. I am satisfied with this."
1,Junk right out of the box,"I bought this Apex 1500 DVD player through [a store] online. When I got it home I found that the thing didn't work correctly at all. The ""setup"" key, necessary to conform the DVD player to your system, didn't work. Disc playback locked up on the first track, and the owner's manual leaves a lot to be desired. This DVD player is cheap, but you get what you pay for! Thumbs down..."
4,Great DVD player,"This is a great DVD player for playing burned or bootlegged movies. However the remote could be better, the one I have crapped out on me after about a month. The remote still works but you have to be pretty close to the DVD player for it to work (I thought that the point of having remotes is so that you can be lazy and not have to get up if you want to fast forward or anything)."
4,Best Value for the Lowest Price,"Like many I have a high caliber Sony DVD hooked up to my Surround Sound but I needed a low cost DVD for my bedroom. The Apex was recommended by a friend for its ability to play MP3 and VCD movies. Both of these formats do not play on my Sony so it is nice to know I can watch VCD's that I press or my friend does. The DVD comes with all the features you will need for basic operation, it does have Dolby Digital Output so it can compete with the big boys. Yet if you are looking for 5.1 Decoding and Component Output look elsewhere. For less then $... this is the best DVD on the market, avoid the Oritron and other no names and stick with the Apex."
1,Stopped working in 3 months,"This DVD player stopped working in 3 months. Interesting thing is the warranty only covers you for 90 days. To return it to Apex to be repaired is ""going to cost more money"". If you want quality don't buy this DVD player. If you just want a 90 day ""inexpensive"" item with below average warranty you found it."
1,Horrible,"This is an absolutely horrible DVD player. The first thing you will notice when watching a movie is the sound falls out of synch with the action, extremely annoying. Don't forget to leave your dvd's in the player after watching your movie or the player will burn the dvd.. it ruined two of my dvd's ... you get what you pay for, but with this item you get less for what you pay"
1,Did not work,Didn't work right out of the box! The disk tray did not slide out when pressing the button on the machine or the button on the remote. Kept making a grinding sound. Had to return this immediately for a refund. This problem was not addressed in the instruction manual nor on Apex's website. FAQs were very basic and unhelpful.
3,low end player,"this is actually a good player. but the build quality is just minor. for this cost don't expect much. it has all these features which is nice and fitting, but the build quality is low par at best. first of all, the doorto the player is flimsy. mine fell off. so in closing, you get what you paid for for this player. despite the door falling off. it plays wonderfully.very [lower end] model, but that is my only gripe, that the craftsmanship is very [poor] looking, other then that, the dvd player is good for those looking for an inexpensive player."
4,Something more current.,"I picked up this item in mid 2002.I have had almost no problems at all with this machine since i bought it to replace a Pioneer unit that was stolen from me. This unit from day 1 worked better than the unit it replaced at half the cost.I have only had problems playing about 5 discs, and I play anywhere from 2 to 20 movies/anime/mp3's/cd's a week. The remote may be on the smaller side but well designed (except for the placement of the mute button) It can be a tad loud on the ejecting of the disc tray, but it's not loud enough to be a concern.Easily one of the smartest purchases i've ever made."
3,"Very good, considering the price","I bought mine 11/2001. Compared to some of my friend's dvd players that were purchased near the same price, it was great. The sound and picture quality were pretty good. Two small complaints - 1)The remote buttons pop off easily 2)The front of the disc tray (the panel)came off and with the help of a 2 year old got stuck inside the tray area. My DVD player died 1/2005. Not from my son; it would start freezing and skipping at the beggining and end of scenes."
3,3.5 stars for almost 3 years,"This player can play anything which is good; it even played DVD-RWs for a limited time but then didn't. I still have the receipt to the Apex AD-1500 which I purchased 03/20/02, so I guess if you get lucky it will work almost 3 years. It could have possibly pushed 4 to 5 if I only used it for my other region DVDs like I did in the beginning, but recently have been playing everything back to back in it. If you are going to use the Apex for multiregional than it's a good buy as long as you use your other player for everything else, just don't pay too much for it. I still think it's unreliable though."
2,Great until it broke,"I bought this player a little over a year ago, mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to region-free. Played everything I put in it until a few days ago, when it started having intermittent problems- graphics were staticy and blocky, sound would just buzz and it wouldn't eject discs until I shut it down and restarted it. That lasted for two days before the problem became permanent. Now it's a doorstop. The Apex web site appears to be down right now, but based on the other reviews here I doubt there's much point in contacting them."
2,Not so good for rental dvd's,"Cheap player. Plays new dvd's fine, but freezes on the rental dvd's. I know it's the Apex player that is at fault because when I play the same rented dvd movie on my Pioneer dvd player, it worked fine. This has happened twice in 2 weeks. I am definitely returning it for a refund."
4,Regionfree,"If you Google for this model, you can find out how to easily make it region free, so you can watch the foreign DVDs you bring back. It is pretty solid, but has no R/G/B or optical outputs; RCA and S-Video only."
2,Picture Fades In & Out,"Ok, so I was a little sketched out buying this brand at first because I had never heard of it. But, I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot; It seemed like a lot of people had dvd pictures that faded in & out. However, there were a lot of people (and the manual as well) who said that was because they weren't hooking it up directly into the TV. Well, I did hook it up directly into my TV and still got a picture that fades in & out and isn't really clear. Also, there is a clicking sound when a DVD is played, which is really annoying after awhile. I should've listened to my instincts and paid a little more for some quaility. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because I like the size of it (very compact) and the size makes it a great bedroom DVD player...now if only it'd play the way it is supposed to."
1,Terrible product,"Don't waste your money on this product. I bought it because it's [inexpensive]. However it has trouble decoding most DVDs, quits playing CDs about halfway through, and injects static into music. Spend ... more to buy something from a reputable manufacturer; you'll be a lot happier."
2,Brightness is a real issue,"My unit plays all disks and seems fine at first glance. But it has a seriously weird problem: when you play a rental dvd the picture appears very bright, as if overexposed. It does this only with rental dvds -- I have 3 or 4 bought at stores, and these play great. I haven't heard of others reporting this problem, so it doesn't seem frequent, but certainly it adds to the quality issues mentioned by others."
4,"Easy on the eyes, soft on the pocket book","I bought the APEX 1500 on Valentine's Day and have been in DVD viewer heaven ever since. I bought this very inexpensive unit with the idea that it would be `throw-away' electronics but now find that - wow - this unit delivers everything I need right now. I put the popcorn in the microwave and before it was done popping, I had the unit out of the box, set-up, connected, and was watching my first DVD movie before the popcorn was cooled.You know, until one matches a DVD player with a HDTV, one isn't getting the full `visual value' of the DVD capability. So, until those HDTV prices drop, this unit's low, low price and great image delivery looks fantastic on my 27 inch, 12 year old, Toshiba television. .I watch only purchased or rented DVDs (about 2 or 3 per week) - I do not play MP3, CD, underground copies of movies and the like."
1,This thing [is bad]!,"I received this dvd player as a gift Christmas of 2001. The sound often goes out halfway through the movie being watched, and periodically the entire machine goes out and has to be unplugged to ""reboot"". Recently, it went out completely. This is not due to wear and tear. This machine rarely gets used and is only a year old. It should be in peak condition. Do not waste your money on this machine!"
3,Middle of the road,"The polarity on these reviews seems to tell a tale. Everyone either got a 'good one' or a 'bad one'. I didn't start getting 'no disk' errors until I had used the machine (fairly heavily) for 11 months. But you know what? I'm still satisfied that I got my money's worth, based on the cost of the player. Sure, it's a hassle replacing it - but I'm seriously thinking about buying the same model again.While it was working, we had no problems at all. Excellent picture and sound quality. I purchased this particular model after reading many reviews for low-cost players. This was one that seemed to have the best features and reliability in the price range I was looking for.The way I look at it, you can buy two or three 'disposable' units by the time you pay for one high-end machine. And, the way things change so quickly with electronics these days, I'm not in a big hurry to invest in a 3 - 4 year machine just to find it limited or even obsolete in 2."
1,Piece of junk,"Stopped working after about 90 days, at whichpoint the warranty no longer covers labor.No wonder it was the lowest priced."
1,Chinese made junk,"Bought this fine product in ... 2001... Rented approximately 6 DVD's since purchasing. Six months later went to watch a DVD, and the player is dead, and does not turn on. My whole theater system is plugged in a high quality surge protector, and everything else works fine. Assume the [money] I paid for the DVD player was not worth the bargain. Suggest a Sony or name brand player."
1,Problems with picture,Its hard to describe so let me just say the picture was doing a lot of screwy things and the colors were off.
1,Explanation of Problems - & Other Issues,"The problem with the video-changing brightness= You cannot run it through a VCR or other device. It must be directly connected to the tv. Also...it helps if your tv is digital... The brightness is an issue when you have the device near or running through other electronic devices.Other issue. After 20 minutes of dvd playing, it starts making a chopping sound...and each frame starts skipping. POJ. I knew I shoulda gone with the Sony...."
5,Beyond PV and the trinket shops,"Biodiversity junkies are always ending up off the pavement in the jungles or on mountain tops and wondering where do we get our next meal, and how the hell are we going to get out of here. Mader comes up with answers in a country where surprisingly little has been written to guide the booming ecotourism trade. Lonely Planet and Moon barely scratch the ecotourism surface and brush over Mexico's fantastic national parks and reserves. Mader lives down there so this is no parachute quickie research junket type book. He has done his homework and gone beyond the obvious places (Palenque, Copper Canyon) to explore some of the most remote but best spots. Lucky gringo. I found his book helpful for finding contact leads in Oaxaca and Veracruz states that led to great guided trips with local enviro groups."
4,Very good CD for background ambiance,"I recently bought this CD when I moved into an in-town apartment after having lived in a rural area for several years previously. I found I missed the sounds of nature I had taken for granted at my previous location, especially those sounds you hear in the afternoon and evenings.I don't know where the recording was made, and though I'm fairly certain it was not in the northern forests I am familiar with, it was a close enough approximation for my needs. As one reviewer noted there is some hissing to the recording if you turn it up fairly loud, but as I wanted this CD just for background noise, I keep it turned down low and the hiss is not noticable. I like to put it in my CD player by my bed and fall asleep listening to it.My only complaint would be the shortness of the tracks, which measure around 30 minutes each. This is a minor matter, however, and can be got around by looping the playback."
5,My Favorite Sounds-of-Nature CD So Far!,"I've listened to many nature CDs but this gentle soundscape is the first one I'd actually recommend. What's fascinating is: it's good for working, relaxing, or falling asleep. Perhaps because it's composed of the sounds I heard as a child, it induces sleep or energizes, depending on what I need. Beautifully orchestrated (no music -- just surf, crickets, birds), the way it's all put together is intriguing enough to block out distracting thoughts and noise. Because it's never boring or repetitive I enjoy listening again and again.Thank you, all honest reviewers! It's because of you I bought this recording, and I hope the more we review, the better these products will become."
5,Great Sound from our Bose speakers,"Attached to our Sony LCD HDTV, It makes the sound of watching movies, lisening to music and watching sports - great. We like the compack design & ease of connecting."
5,Wonderful,"Great! I owned my BOSE system for two years....kept saying that I could have purchase a cheeper system...that was until I placed the speakers on the stands and the real BOSE sound filled the room! Great Product, Great Price and easy to put together!"
3,Better slot for wires,I would suggest that the stand be made to accomidate the speaker wire flush against the upright stand pole. The wire cures outside even though it is unseen.
3,BOSE UFS-20 UNIVERSAL FLOOR STANDS,"PURCHASED 3 SETS. AM USING 1 SET FOR MEDIA ROOM, AND THEY ARE FINE, BUT RETURNED 2 SETS DUE TO THEY ARE ONLY CONDUCIVE FOR BOSE SPEAKERS, AND NOT BOSTON ACOUSTICS WHICH CAME WITH AN EARLIER PURCHASE"
4,speaker stands,The only reason I give these a 4 star rating is due to the instructions. They are only pictures and the pictures apply to multiple different Bose speakers. After spending the time to figure out which picture matched my speakers they went together fine. They are very sturdy and the wobble base is weighted so it won't tip over unless someone purposely tips it over. I do not reccomend them in a house that has small children for that reason. It was easy to assemble especially for me with not much mechanical expertise. Another top quality Bose product.
4,Great Stands,Great stands. They are exactly what I ordered and look and perform as advertised. good price too.
4,"Expensive, but worth it.","If you've already sunk the money in for the speakers you might as well get the stand built just for the speaker. The base is heavy, and they are easy to put together. I thought that I would constantly notice them, but it's surprising how unobtrusive they are. And they put the speaker at just the right height."
4,overall good buy,Sturdy and elegant at the same time. Makes the entertainment center more aesthetic. Also helped sound quality since speakers at the right level of hearing while in seated position.
4,These were included in the Costco unit for no charge.,Very solid stands and attractive. A must have to obtain the necessary distance apart unless you have a wide TV or component stand.
5,Excellent Product,Excellent choice for small speakers with customized wiring. The material is great and the design is simple yet elegant. Highly recommended!
2,"These are not ""universal"" stands","I can't speak to the quality of the product but you should know that these stands are made specifically for Bose speakers and will not mount speakers with keyhole mounting brackets or 1/4""-20 mounting threads."
5,Just the ticket.,We didn't want to use wall mounts in our great room for our Bose speakers. These get the speakers off the furnature and out of the way without tearing holes in the walls. They hide the speaker wires very well.
4,Nice stands,I like the stands. Assembly was easy and they hide the speaker wires nicely. I think there are lots of stands that would help produce the same sound quality but I wanted to keep my whole system Bose. I have a Bose 3-2-1 system and it works greats for these speakers.
3,Adjustments needed:,The Bose floor stands are sturdy for their sleek design and seem to disapear into the landscape. My only and major disappointment is that it shorter then I expected and wish the stands had an adjustment to allow it to be postioned higher. I wanted the speakers to be in the middle of my TV.
3,"Useful, nice looking","The product itself is very nice, slim and sleek it hides the speaker wire inside it's tube-like body and promotes that wireless look, very easy to Assemble. Once assembled and the speakers attached the stand holds firm with no worries of them tipping over, I am very happy with the looks and performance. I'd say if there is anything negitive about this product it would be the price, I strongly feel they are way over priced for what they are used for."
3,Looks nice,"I bought these stands for my Bose speakers, I have an older speaker system 1996. These stands work with the speakers ok but you can tell they are more for the newer style speakers, I still like them though they look really good. But because of the fact that the speakers don't fit on there quite the way the directions states I give it the three stars."
5,speaker stands,Just perfect. We were not sure what to expect and got the unexpected. They were brand new and just what we wanted.Very happy
5,Bose Speaker Stands,"The Bose stands are heavily weighted at the bottom and are easily assembled. A great buy here on Amazon. Other sites, stores, etc. sell these at around $99.00/set. An excellent product!"
5,Great Bose Speaker Stands,"These are exactly what you would expect from Bose - sturdy, easy to put together and very sturdy!"
1,Bose UFS-20 Universal is,Others have noted shortcomings - poor design features including the speaker mounting assembly. The speaker pole is held in the base by a plastic nub which BREAKS! End of your expensive investment. Do not buy these speaker stands if you expect to move them about as when cleaning. The base is quite heavy and torque generated by the swaying pole will crack the plastic nub.
3,Way overpriced,I haven't had any problems with these (but then what sort of problems does one have with slabs of metal?) but the price is about 10 times higher than what it's worth.
3,Bose speaker stands- jewel cub speakers need shorter screws,"Bose UFS-20 Universal Floor Stands (pair) - BlackThe ""jewel"" cube speakers are a bit of a problem as they require shorter screws than what is provided. Hardware stores do not carry black so you will need to paint them if you are particular. Also the speakers have a plug-in to the rear of the speaker not allowing you to run the wire through the the stand as intended. the back cover does not fit as the plug-in is to large and is in the way of the cover, so it can not be used.I like that they are easy to assemble and have great balance using smaller bose speakers."
2,disappointed,"The stands are very sturdy, the bases are heavy. But I could not get the Bose speaker wires to stay in the slots on the stem,therefore am returning them due to my disappointment."
2,Not Bose quality,"Sorry, the speakers don't attach well, and the quality of these stands is not what I'm used to with a Bose system."
4,Beats going to BOSE stores,I saved some bucks by not going to my neighborhood's BOSE store for this product. I am satisfied with this purchase.
2,don't expect them to last long,initially these look great and are fairly easy to set up. Over time the speakers start pointing down about 15 degrees even if you try to tighten everything-I've had mine for a couple years
4,"Nice, but there are other alternatives","The stands are nice, but I think if I were to do it again, I would go with the more generic stands that fit the bose speakers. For the money they want for the ""Bose"" name on the stands, you could save some $$ and go with the generics instead."
3,"Great stands, but not universal","The stands are really well built. They are solid and heavy, able to hold a good sized speaker. They are not universal though. My Yamaha speakers did not fit. I had to use different screws and add some nuts to make them fit right."
5,Afterall it's Bose!,Does not need much explanation - It's original Bose product and perfect Bose quality. If you order it from Bose's website you will end up paying $100 so better order here and save ~40%. The base is quite heavy to hold the speaker of cine-mate series and the bar has place to hide cable that goes to speakers. Like some other reviewers notes you won't believe but it improves the sound quality (particularly surround sound) a lot (may be 30-40%). If you have speaker and are currently keeping them on your TV stand you are not fully utilizing their potential.
3,Its short,It fits perfectly on my bose speakers as promised although its a tad short as compared to the pictures. And it wiggles slightly when on top of the carpet as compared to standing on hardwood floors.
5,Heavy Duty Stands,I have a Bose Cinemate GS II setup and these floor stands were on my list to get for a while now. They are super solid and very simple to put together. I couldn't be happier with these. A quality product at a great price!
5,Nice product,These look great and work great. They got a nice finish and make my living room look cleaner with out the cables in the way.
5,Bose Speaker Floor Stands,Perfectly designed speaker stands for the Bose speakers. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble.
4,Awesome and sturdy,Easy to assemble sturdy. I wish it could have adjustable height and rotating arms for the speaker it would have help a lot.
5,I saw these at the Bose store at the mall for 99.00 each.,I saw these speaker stands at the mall for 99.00 each. I got them on Amazon for 59.00 for the pair. You cannot beat the price.The stands look great. The function extremely well and look high tech and sleek. They become invisible in the room.
1,Awkward fit for older Bose speakers,"I bought 4 of this. It is well made. I would have given this product a 5 star if not because it is not a good fit for older Bose speakers. I have to put the speakers upside down in order to make it work. It is change of design that does not add value to new customers yet creates huge inconvenience for old customers. Again in all fairness the product has no defect or something like that, but it is a design change on Bose part that I do not understand and do not like."
5,Bose speaker floor stands,"Everything dealing with audio I purchase Bose. Even there speaker stands are the best, as funny as that may sound."
5,Excellent design,I bought two sets of this to go with my Yamaha speaker system. I have to say the build quality and design are amazing! Way better than any $60 stands you can buy.
5,Sound Improved,"These speaker stands have improved the quality of sound. We had the speakers on top of the cabinet, about three feet high by about three feet apart from each other and was disappointed in the sound. After using these stands, the sound has improved. The speakers are now about five feet apart from each other and about five feet high. They are very heavy at the base following a slim tube (enough to hold the wires) and the speaker sits on that. Very nice design."
5,Versatile Dance Album,"Hi! We've taken a lot of time to put together this album. We hope you like it. ""T-Spoon"" has become a very versatile album with musical styles ranging from eurodance, future trance, euroreggae, europop and R&B. Keep in mind that we are a dance band so... all tracks will do well on the dancefloor, except for the ballads of course.. but they can be remixed:). We hope you like the downtempo songs as well as the upbeat songs! For more info and samples go to http://www.t-spoon.com"
5,Hilarious,"This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is I think quite different from US movies in that the comedy does not come from a witty script but from slapstick and absurd situations executed with real flair. The actors are marvellous, Jean Reno in my opinion taking second prize to Christian Clavier who plays both his roles with jaw-dropping skill. There is so much comic detail in this film that it works best second time. And this is a great family film: the nippers will be as delighted as I trust you will be. A treasure. Please discover now."
5,French DVD,I'm from France so I grow up with this movie. I'm teaching French and I think it's a really funny movie to show
5,"It was a great, funny and exciting. Also very enjoyable.","Jean Reno, Muriel Robin et Christian Clavier: partis pour une nouvelle aventure dans les couloirs de la comedie. I would Reccommend it to anyone. There was plenty of laughter, and comedy. I watched it on Channel SBS Australia on October 4 1999."
3,Festive movie.,"OK, OK, it's a French movie with subtitles. But it's really very funny. Knight & lackey get wizarded to the present, both meet their descendants. Of course, no one believes they are who they say they are. Medieval customs and morals values confront modern French customs and moral values. Hilarity ensues.Some of the costumes, armor, etc, are off by about 300 years, but the movie's a lark, so who cares."
1,Do not buy this DVD unless you speak French !!!,"I've bought this DVD recently through Amazon.I've been looking foward to watching this movie, and I've got theDVD. However, there is no way that I can enjoy this movie. THERE IS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE !!!"
5,Amazing acting!,"What makes this film work so well is the believability of the performances. Jean Reno absolutely masters the combination of brutality, arrogance and chivalry one imagines 11th century knights to be like. Christian Clavier is wonderful in dual roles as a peasant and a hotelier. Valerie Lemercier is brilliant in her modern day role coming from old money. Nothing the eccentrics did phased her: the smells, the behaviorisms, the disasters. Her husband on the other hand, plays the new rich, self made man, who can't control himself when something happens below his modern standards. I can't wait to see The Visitors II."
5,Inteligent and funny,"This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Funny from start to end. It's inteligent, it's refined, it's funny! Just imagine a medieval knight thrown into modern times by mistake of a sorcerer just to discover its castle turned into a hotel and owned by the grand-grand-son of his servant. Oh, this is comedy. Don't miss it!"
5,Hilarious,"This is the funniest French movie I have ever seen! Yes, it is in French with English subtitles, but I think it is funnier in French anyway. If you just can't deal with it being in French with subtitles, get the alternative movie, Just Visiting, it is in English with the same great actors."
3,Jean Reno is great!,"Ever since I saw ""The Professional"" I've been impressed by Jean Reno and have been waiting to see more of his work. I just saw on cable the film ""Just Visiting"", the english remake of this French version, I got many laughs out of the film and Christina Applegate is always easy on the eyes. So I wanted to see the original.The Visitors, is a good movie, no doubt about it, but, I prefered the english remake. The DVD is very limited without any real extra features. Great for french students, because you can turn off the english subtitles. I don't regret the purchase but, it seems a bit pricey for what you get."
2,Mediocre comedy,"Having seen the movie once I would definitely say that I will never come back to it again. May be I have overgrown this kind of movies. But still it is more for kids than for adults. It is a disaster if you compare it with the top French comedies with Belmondo, Richard, de Funes, etc."
1,"My copy was ""French Language"" only","It said ""English"",it came with only ""French"" (English Subtitles). My copy would only be good if learning French was your objective."
1,Disappointed,"I had the movie Just Visiting and I loved it. I thought it was extremely entertaining and hilarious. So I decided to get the movie The Visitors, I was so excited to get it. When I finally did receive it and put it in the player to watch it, I realized that it was in french. No where on the cover or on the site in Amazon was it noted that it was filmed in french with SOME subtitles. I was very disappointed and it was too late to return it since I had already opened the seal. I had expected for Amazon to at least mention that slight detail for it's consumers before they make their purchase. Had the DVD itself noted that anywhere on it, I would not have opened it and just returned it."
4,Very funny film,This is a very funny film. I laughed out loud several times. It would appeal to all from age 12 and up. Shows the mayhem that happens when two medieval Frenchmen are transported to the modern world. Very good tonic for the blues!
5,Best book I have read in a long time.,I appreciated the honesty in this book. Especially concerning the struggles and sacrifices it takes to become number one in your field. This book has inspired me to go as far as I can in the aviation world.
5,Fascinating. A must read!,"This was a book I couldn't put down. Although the writing style is not 100% focused, this story of one woman's quest to find herself and her purpose in life was inspiring. Growing up in Japan, Switzerland, and California, with post-adolescent years in Australia and Alaska, Patty's life has been far from common, yet she touched a part of me left over from the 70's. I'm sure other women will relate to her yearning search for her own identity as well.In addition, her explanations of flying, aerobatics and why she was drawn to aviation are clear enough for the layman, yet inspiring for other pilots as well. Although Patty is no longer a competition pilot, her book clearly shows that she has what it takes to make a mark on whatever she chooses to turn her attention & dedication to in the future. Go girl!!!"
5,Desert photos,"I live in Arizona and wanted protection for my camera when I take hikes, this was it and a lot cheaper than anywhere else I could find. Great little product, had to pull and tug a little when mounting my Tamron lens on, but Canon lenses cleared with no problems."
3,Camera Armor review,"I bought this because I thought it would be a good idea to have on my camera during backpacking trips, but it collects dust like a dust magnet. My concern is that it will end up attracting more dust into my camera. It also makes it a little more difficult to press some of the buttons, but I'm sure most of that is just getting used to it. I do however like the lens hood.....when I don't want it around my lens all i have to do is fold it back instead of screw something off. I'm not going to use the camera body armor, but I am going to continue using the lens hood."
5,John CA-1112-Blk Camera Armor is outstanding,"I think that the CA-1112 Camera Armor Case is an good ideas, I think that all cameras need a case that fit like a glove. The rubberized comfort protectes your camera."
4,Not too darn bad.,"Actually very happy with this product. I don't use the lense armor that came with the package because it collects dust, hair, and dirt. But the camera armor is superb. Fits very well, and covers all important parts. Allows full use of camera, but it has a different feel. (You have to be more patient and deliberate about how you push your buttons.) A great buy, and excellent value. Glad to own it, and will buy more for each camera I own in the future."
4,Hope this Helps !,I hope this info helps prevent anyone else from making the same mistake that I did. After much research I incorrectly presumed that this armor would also fit the Canon Rebel XT. IT DOES NOT! The lcd screen and some other small button placement differences prevent one from using this cover. I accept responsibility for misjudging this product. It would have been helpful to have the protection for my Rebel XT when I travel.
3,Armor Fit.,"The construction material is very good. The operations glass cover is plastic but a good fit. The Armor fit on this model is better then the fit on the T2. On both, the fit where the lens attaches, is a little to much and changing lens requires pulling the armor away as your attaching the lens. Sitting on the couch doing this isn't such a big deal but trying to do it in the field is difficult and can be hazardious for your equipment as it can easily slip from your hands to the ground. The PLUS side of this is that if you don't plan on changing lenses very often, then the Armor gives a nice tight seal between the lens and body to keep dirt out.The MINUS side of the armor is that being what it is, the fit is not a 100% acurate fit, but for the price and what you're trying to accomplish, it's worth the low price."
5,Great armor for the XTI,I love this product. I didn't use the lens armor so I can't comment on that. But the armor for the body fits perfectly and does a good job of protecting from small bumps. Two thumbs up.
4,Worth it to protect your camera.,"I mainly use my XTi to shoot family gathers or when I go on trips. In both instances the camera armor works great. When taking photos of my nieces and nephews, they would always want to see the photo...and touch it. The armor protected my camera from all the sticky dirty kid hands. On travel, I like to just sling the camera over my sholder and that's it. Usually this means my camera will bump against a wall or something. Hiking it is good for too.Don't worry about the dust/dirt. It's suppose to protect your camera not make it look pretty.The lens hood protect thing is useless.If you spent 400, 500, 600 dollars for your camera, this is worth it."
5,Great protection for the Canon Rebel XTi,"This item is great protection for the Canon Rebel XTi, hiking in the woods or for an urban expedition. I only wish they made one for the Sigma SD-14 (my other camera)."
5,Tricky fitting but works great,"As with other reviews I've read, it does take some negotiating before you figure out how it slips on. And other arguments about collecting dust - well I'd rather have dust collecting than scratch and dings on my camera.Expensive? I guess if you think protecting your camera isn't worth the money then perhaps, it is. The lens piece is useless as other review suggests."
4,Very pleased,I'm very pleased with the way Kevin Michael handel my problem after telling him that camera I brought from him was not the one I was looking for.With no qustion ask he put a check in the mail and ask me to send the camera back to him.Kiven Has his phone listed in case u can't reach him by e-mail. When I wrote him to tell him that this was not the camrea I was not looking for and if he would take it back I thought oh mg ghosh I lost my money.But not a day later Kevin e-mail me to tell the check was in the mail. Thank You Kevin. Cindy..And The same day I taked to some one on the phone who knew Kevin I sent out the camera.
4,Close to five stars,"Good protection, it looks like a ""Batman camera"" but it really works!!HOWEVER...!!! the plastic hard cover for the screen make difficult to access some functions, so that's why I prefer use it without screen protection."
5,Good buy! Compact and light DSLR.,"My last SLR was a Canon FTb which I bought around 30 years ago. Yes, you can just imagine the change in technology. Even though I currently own a Canon G3 and familiar with digital photography, I bought this camera to improve my Hockey photos, primarily to use a faster shutter speed and remove that annoying delay in camera response during shooting. I've been very impressed with it so far. With a cheap $120 Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 lens, I am able to use it in Tv mode, ISO 1600, AF Servo, and a shutter speed of 1/160 to take pictures that just need a little fixing-up in photoshop to produce near professional quality pictures.My next step would be to save enough money to be able to purchase a faster lens (f2.8) to increase the amount of light reaching the sensor in dark-lit hockey rinks.I recommend this DSLR to anyone wanting to improve their school-based sports photography on a budget."
5,Best for the money,"You can not go wrong with Moog. Replaced the inner tie rods and so far they're great. No issue with them non what so ever. If you need to upgrade your suspension, I would recommend Moog product."
1,Dont waste your money...,"This book has one over-riding theme repeated constantly: The White Man is always wrong and the Indian is and has always been an innocent victem. I won't list details, but the lack of objectivity and obvious implications to the promote the theme are insulting. Although the book may contain some valuable and useful facts about Native Americans and their lifestyles, it is impossible to determine how authentic any of them are due to the overt propaganda that is being constantly asserted."
2,This Crystal collection doesn't glitter with hits,"House diva Crystal Waters stunning the music world with club hits like ""Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)"", ""100% (Pure Love)"" and ""Makin' Happy"" you might think that she may have more to offer through her career span of albums, she does, but it's not here tho'.This is called THE COLLECTION, 14 total tracks, 11 somewhat hits, 3 remixes. This is a collection? There are remixes of ""100% (Pure Love)"", ""Makin' Happy"" and ""Relax"" and a club mix of ""Just A Freak"", shoten ""Just A Freak"" and omit those other 3 remixes and you'd have 18-20 selections total, easy. She also does a Dead Or Alive cover of ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)"".THE COLLECTION is missing songs to even be called a collection. Done by Spectrum Music, the same peeps who did Ce Ce Peniston ESSENTIAL collection, obvious that record company did not follow the Ce Ce Peniston pattern with this disc."
3,Musicians of Today,"I'm ordering this book as a replacement copy for a brittle book in our music library, so I had occasion to review it briefly. It's well written and pleasant to read as well as giving an interesting glimpse of musical culture at the turn of the nineteenth century. I would consider it worth purchasing for either a library or a student who has interest in music history."
3,to much smoke and to many sing alongs,"This BD is average , could have been great with clear video(to much fogg /smoke) and less audience participation ."
2,Had to Return the DVD to get my money back!,"This is her worst concert to date. Her outfits were beautiful as usual, but the there were barely any lights and the atmosphere was dark. I enjoyed the other DVD's more with the bright lights and dance moves!"
2,Boring dvd!,"OK i love Beyonce. I think she's a talented artist and a very entertaining performer. She usually gives it her ALL. I went to the ""I am Yours"" concert in Anaheim in 2009 and she blew my mind. It was amazing! That being said, i was disappointed with her intimate performance at the Wynn. It was a snoozefest. I slept about 3 times through the dvd. She sang songs i didn't know like satellite & some others. Why couldn't she perform more hits like baby boy, upgrade you?! Bottom line: Don't waste your money buying this dvd unless you're looking for something to help with your insomnia! Check out ""The Beyonce Experience"" dvd instead."
2,Not What You are Accustomed to from Queen Bey,"This concert was a very watered down production of her normal show. I saw her in my home town and she was much better. I recognize that in Vegas you must put on a different kind of show, but she should not have put this out on DVD. She should have taped in one of her normal cities for her fans. Still if you are a Beyonce fan like I am, you have to have it."
1,Memorex - not on imacs,I have a new imac 5 intel that can't read the memorex dvd...my older imac 4 also can't read it...don't waste your money trying.
1,Memorex DVD-R disks for computers and CD-R for music,"I have had no success using Memorex DVD-R disks for backup with my iMac G4, nor with a new MacBook Pro. They simply do not work. Nor will Memorex CD-R disks work with my Sony CD player/recorder.Charles Hans Winecoff"
3,"Nice, but not quite as much as I was hoping for...","I bought this book in the hopes of finding some more detailed data on spacecraft and space facilities in the Shadowrun 'verse, everything else would have been a side benefit. While it did have some nice fluff, I had been hoping for some more maps and statistics, something that D&D; 3.x/Pathfinder is quite fond of ladling out by comparison. Sure, this game's a bit less map-oriented and kind of free-form, but there's only so much I can handle myself. Ah well. At least I now know what the Desert Wars are.I see why they complained a lot about cruft in 3E, organization leaves something to be desired in these books. I'll figure out how to make use of it somehow...or I'll find a more skilled GM to sell it to."
3,i liked but compared to reggae gold '98 this was a let down.,"i loved the songs that was on the cd but some of them did not belong on reggae gold '99, maybe on some other dancehall mix. this is reggae gold and though a song maybe good does not mean that it is gold. there is a certain quality that a song must have in order to be on reggae gold, and this year not all the songs in my opinion had that quality. i do however recommend this cd for other listeners."
4,Solid!,"Given that most of the songs are remakes, the artists definitely know how to add reggae harmony. This particular album is consistant with the previous ones, you'll find songs you love and songs you hate. But over all this is one CD you can bob your head to!"
3,Not too bad!,"Alright,Reggae Gold series has alwayas represented.As for reggae gold 99, it was alright. I think that the best word for it. The song on there that don't make ya regret buying it would have to be Sancez's ""Only You"" and Beenie Man's ""Fire Burn"" and the combe of Mr.Vegas & Sean Paul ""Haffi Get a Gal"". Everything else was so-so. If you listen to the cd maybe two,three times after you first buy it will grow on you. It doesn' hit you like Reggae95, which was one of their best series. They have next year to improve on it."
3,It aint that Good,"It wasnt great and was barely good. I had high expectations for it but I only like Buju/Beres's song much. This was pretty weak, VP should have used some of the songs from Planet Reggae for this."
5,Just Groovin' Rasta,This cd shows what reggae is really about! All of the hottest reggae singers show why Reggae Gold is the number one collection to buy. Keep on making reggae music!
5,Wonderful Spring Basket!,This came super quick and it was so cute! I am going to use it for my Godson's first Easter Basket and it will be perfect. It has just enough space for small candy and a few trinkets and of course if your an Elmo fan you will love this basket for sure!!!
1,Disgraceful Desecration of the United States Flag,"This item is disgraceful; it is a desecration of our beautiful United States flag! The eagle may also be a proud symbol of our country, but this depicts it destroying the flag. Both unpatriotic and in very bad taste, it is just horrible!If you must, fly a separate flag with the eagle beneath the United States flag, not on top of it!!!"
5,The Miracle of Dialogue,I found the book very instructive as to the definition and practice of dialogue. I recommend it to many others.
5,Would never have to buy another trash can!,"I have gone through so many different types of trash cans through out the years and I have to say that this one would be my last one. Its wonderful! Great for dog owners. My dog who would get into the trash every now and again is unable to get into this one for there is no space for her to stick her nose in to open the lid. Same with kids, it can not be opened unless u step on the stepper part to open it there is just not enough space to stick your finger in it. Its nicely closed. You never see the trash bag hanging over for the outside of the trash can, it just all stays inside. The lid does not fall off when I step to open it, not like the plastic ones that slam open and shut. For this trash can closes slowly (no slams)! To top it off it looks great and with this shape u can stick it anywhere. Very highly recommended!!! Not only I ended getting one so did my sister and mom as well. Its worth every penny!"
3,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the of the Daw Feb 1987 paperback editionCover art by John HarrisWhen the exploratory spaceship Starventure had soared to the stars in search of new worlds for mankind, top science journalist David Drummond had been proud that his own brother Leon was part of the crew. Now Starventure was back in the solar system, heading for its long-awaited rendezvous with Earth.And suddenly the logical, scientific foundations of David's world were falling apart. For though he knew his brother was still millions of miles away, David also knew that he had seen Leon walking the streets of Earth that very day. And before long, the whole world would know what David was about to discover. Something was terribly wrong aboard Starventure, something that could change the entire future of all humankind!"
5,Nice Case,"I've traveled with laptops since the early '90's, all makes and models, many cases. My last case was a alum. Samsonite which after many miles broke a latch. My new laptop is a HP ProBook 4525S with a 15.6"" screen which fits in this case like a hand in a glove, & with sufficient breathing room. Don't expect to carry your AC adaptor or full size accessories in this case, but if you're out for more than a day, you've got other luggage with you anyway. Newer laptops are thinner and this slimmer case accomodates nicely. I'm in and out of my laptop 20 times a day, access it while in the case & store it on the floor board or on the car seat. Hard side cases keep me from dumping the laptop out on the pavement if the softside top isn't zipped when I grab the handle and go. (Don't understand why they don't fit softside cases with two handles.) Fit and finish on this case is beautiful, sturdy with substantial latches which are easily opened and closed. Couldn't ask for more."
2,"poor packaging, possibly defective",I purchased this as a Christmas present for my grandson. The packaging was pretty beat up and even had a hole n the box. It was close to Christmas so I decided to take it to North Carolina to be assembled. The assemblers say the frame is bent but they might be able to fix it. I don't know if that is acceptable. I do not want my grandson riding an unsafe bike. I may just return it. This is the first time I have had a problem with a package from Amazon.
5,Great Bike,My son loves his bike. We've had no problems! He rides it all time. Dont leave it in the sun the plate between the handle bars fades and breaks quickly
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I have to say that this is the first thoroughly disappointing product I bought from Amazon. I purchased this for my son's 5th birthday. When I took it out of the box the night before his party to put it together, I found a) that the bike was white and not blue as depicted in the picture; and b) that the package was missing a few items - including the SEAT?!?!? I debated whether or not to order this based on other reviews and cave in given my son's great love for spider man. My mistake.On the positive side, Amazon was quick to offer a refund (replacement is not an option as of 8/23/12 given that a number of people had issues with the bike). As always, I'm grateful for Amazon's customer service."
2,Rear wheel with a large hole from the inside and this manufacturing defect,"Rear wheel with a large hole from the inside and this manufacturing defect ,I hope the illustration, and I want to replace the rear wheel only"
5,Good bike,"I recently shipped this cycle to my 4 year nephew who calls himself ""The Spidy"". He thoroughly loves it and would'nt stop biking now. This is the latest addition into his spiderman world. The spiderman helmet set goes as a fantastic combo with the bike."
3,"Nice bike, but a pain to assemble","Good looking bike, but assembly was a bear. The front wheel didn't fit into the front forks. I had to beat, twist, and pull for an hour to finally get it to fit. Also, the handbrake, which controls the rear wheel, was very loose and doesn't tighten up very well. I've put together many bikes in my life, but this one ranks up there as one of the biggest pains. My son loves it, though, so it was worth the effort. I did see it cheaper at other sites but, I bought this a few weeks before the best deals came out to ensure I got it. Overall, a decent purchase, although the fit and finish should've been much better. I recommend if buying this bike, get it where you can have it assembled!"
3,Spider man bike,"I bought this for my son's 5th birthday. I went to put it together and the back brakes were bent, there was a dent in the back bar, the chain guard was misshaped and rubbed on the chain and the paint is chipped all over. My husband fix the big issues and over all the bike is good and my son was totally thrilled."
1,Toxic Bike,"We bought this bike 5 months ago. It came partially assembled, and we had no problem putting the rest of the bike together. It was attractive, and we were fine w/quality....but the bike stinks really, really badly. We took our son to a parking lot that was enourmous. When the wind blew I could smell the bike (kind of a toxic smell that is worse than paint). I thought that leaving the bike in our parking garage would solve things.....5 months later we still can't transport the bike in our car because the fumes are so stong."
1,Total junk,"I bought this bike from Toys'R'Us in a box and had to return it because it was next to impossible to assemble and overall built quality was horrible. This is an example of a product produced evidently without any quality control whatsoever. The front wheel was about 3-4 mm wider than the front fork which it was supposed to fit into. There were only two ways to get it in - use brutal force and expand the fork at a risk of damaging it or assemble it incorrectly by removing the nuts which should go inside of the fork. Perhaps this is how toy stores have to do it - but in this case I would not want this bike anyway. The wheel bearing felt overtightened to the level that wheel would not spin freely, the handlebars would turn only with signficant friction and effort. I was amazed to see what kind of junk this bike is. Stay away by all means."
2,stinky china,bike had strong rancid smell most likely tires. I think they are aloud to use outlawed chemicals. seat had a stain from tire. paint had chips. all bearings needed to be repacked with fresh grease. they used some kind of grese that hardened and race was overtightened
1,Avoid this bike,It is poorly constructed. They used substandard bolts for the rear wheel. Traning wheels are junk and dont come with the stabliser to keep them from going backward or foward over even the smallest curb. SAVE your money for something better.
3,Low Quality China Bike,"The old saying ""You Get What You Pay For"" definitely applies here. This bike is low quality but you shouldn't expect much these days when you pay $[...]. Good bikes are $[...]+ even for children. We put the bike together and found that both wheels were out of round. I had to true the wheels but even after that, the rims are still so low in quality that they weren't very even. One other issue is that the caliper brakes are almost useless. I had to adjust them to the max just to get them close to the correct spot on the rim for them to work. The pads fall short of the metal part of the rim. The manufacturer should have saved the $[...] on the caliper brake and put it into better quality rims. It is ridable and my son loves Spiderman so we will keep it. Bear in mind that it will only be used for a year or two and you will be OK. If you are in the least bit worried about quality, go with a better brand at a bike store. I bought this bike at Target for $[...]."
1,"Wheels wobble, unusable.","This ""Spider-Man Bike (16-Inch Wheels)"", was intended for my Grandson for his BIG Christmas present. Sadly the bike could not be used because both wheels wobbled badly after assembly. My Son-in-Law went to Walmart at 8:30pm Christmas Eve. He found and purchased a Huffy ""Disney Cars Boys' Bike"" and Christmas was saved. Lesson Son-in-law learned: Don't wait until the day before Christmas to put together the big present! Amazon arranged for UPS to pick up the bike and we returned it for a refund. Amazon sent the refund very quickly including shipping costs, no questions asked. This is the first time that we've had any problems with something we've ordered. I will continue to order from Amazon, actually already have!"
3,ok for the price,Took a bit to assemble and my son kept disconnecting the brake wires.. but he was only three at the time.. He also struggled with it as it is quite heavy but ultimately got the hang of it.Now he is almost 4 (and the size of the average 5.5 years old) and we bike regularly but on a flat safe surface so he almost never needs to use the brakes.The only real problem we have is with the pedals. Every now and then I will be biking with them and one of them will become unscrewed and will fall off. This is easily fixed by screwing the pedals back but is a little scary. i can imagine this being a real problem if we were biking fast and or going on a hill.
3,wheels suck,"The wheels on this bike are not align, it touches the sides of the frame. If you know how to fix this problem get it. You are going to need to pay to get it fix."
5,A wonderful set of measuring cups!,"This is a cute and very functional set of measuring cups. It takes up very little room, pops open and snaps shut easily, measures accurately and snaps together easily, keeping them all in place. A totally perfect set that does exactly what it is supposed to do."
3,Encino Man,"Great quality, no scratches or worn-out areas. No complains on the shipping. I got what I paid for. I think I was in a weird movie phase when I bought this a few years back."
3,A real guilty pleasure,"I find it hard to put a movie down that gives you some real good laughs and this movie does have it's moments. It's so unfathomable in it's plot, but that's what makes it a good escapism movie. The three leads (ASTIN, SHORE AND FRASER) are all aptly cast in their roles. Fraser plays the caveman (a little too convincingly), Shore is always good as the [silly] side-kick (but man is he good at that) and Astin..well he is so [darn] cutein this movie, who cares about his acting. ;)If you are looking for an intelligant and profound movie watching experience, don't rent/buy this. Stick to the classics. If you want 88 minutes of silliness and nonsense, you're in the right place."
4,bodacious,"well i stumbled upon this diamond in the rough whilst trying to look up T3 and pirates of the carribean.what a marvelous storyline, link pulls at your heart strings right from the word go, i hope i can be a caveman."
3,SWEET AND LIKEABLE,"ENCINO MAN has no agenda, no political statement to make...it's a sweet and likeable film. And I'll bet there are many future PhD's who quoted liberally from this one...and can repeat verbatim the convenience store scene. Sometimes it's great to just sit back and watch one like this."
5,This DVD/Film...,"I think this is the best ever made movie and Sean, Brendan andPauly are the best ever people to live and walk the earth! Wiez thejuice and I'll be ba-ack!!!!!!!!"
3,buddy,i got this because i love pauly shore. its a cute film and worth a wATCH. I HAD TO ADD IT TO MY AMAZING MOVIE COLLECTION
5,LoveThisMovie,Bought this movies fo ny father its one of his favorites. Recieved the dvd earlier than date shown which was a huge plus! Buy this dvd cant go wrong. Instant favorite
2,A pretty good hard rock version of 'Wild Thing' by Cheap Trick helps a decent soundtrack but the movie...,"...has a pretty thin plot. Ice/'Cave' Man isthawed out by ""Rudy"" (Sean Astin) and (Ass)Pauly Shore [who's (bogus)'West Coast SurferRap' has grown pretty lame by now]. BrendanFraser is likable in this yet another attemptat Pro-Evolutionist b.s...."
1,Another disaster from (use)Les Mayfield,"This stinking cesspool of dung is one of a long list of movies starring Pauly Shore. Forgive me, Dinah, but your son may be the most useless and unentertaining clods Hollywood has ever offered, and this movie showcases Pauly's terminal buffoonery. Did girls at the time think that he was ""cute?"" Perhaps, but as far as being a convincing actor, even in the horrible parts he has played, he has shown me nothing but a foul odor. I have also read the list of movies directed by Mr. Mayfield and, while having a fair amount of success over the years, he has failed to leave us with anything truly memorable. Most of his films are aimed at stupid teenagers and are supported by VERY shallow comedy. I wish Mr. Mayfield well and hope that someday he can find something to direct that he can be proud to be remembered by, not some Martin Lawrence crap or this awful, awful movie. This is in my top 10 WORST movies of all time."
1,A horribly stupid movie,"This movie was bad beyond words. Pauly Shore as usual was pathetic and the plot was nonexistent. What a joke, Frasier can do better."
5,Funny Movie,"If you want to have a relaxing movie to watch, this is the movie to watch. You can see some well known actors perform in the early parts of their acting."
