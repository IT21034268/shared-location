5,A *MUST* have for every computer owner.,"Incredible.It is true, experienced or new - this book is a definite must read for anyone who makes a living in the computer field. Whether you are a developer,administrator, or Engineer, this is practical advice from obvious gurus in the industry.These men are serious about giving you real, solid and invaluable knowledge about securing your comptuer systems.Instead of wandering through blah-blah-blah and making the book huge (which seems to be the case with most computer-related books these days) the authors do a great job of sticking to the purposes of the book.In a single summary, you are only doing yourself GOOD by reading this book."
4,"Respectable coverage on Windows Security, from trustworthy folks","Ben and Brian, (my ex-Microsoft colleagues) have done a great job at providing well-rounded, valuable and actionable coverage of almost all aspects of Windows Security. Good job guys!Thanks,SanjayFormerly, AD Securty PMwww.sanjaytandon.com"
5,For Use with Callahan's bestselling book,"Concise, easy-to-use workbook offers clear step-by-step instructions to work through the four stages of effective long-term planning in Callahan's book. It's organized so that the local church can move through these four stages in six planning sessions. It shows how to determine your church's strengths and weaknesses in each of the 12 central characteristics and how to set key objectives ande timelines that increase the effectiveness of your congregation."
3,Charger,"Was delivered in timely manner. I haven't used it yet though so not sure if it works or not. I'll comment further when I use it.Joe OTomball, Tx."
4,Aconcagua video,This was an excellent video. It was very factual and realistic. Gave a good account of the work and determination that is needed on this mountain. Also shows the realities of high altitude lack of oxygen. This mountain is not to be taken lightly. Great video!Mark
4,"a bit amateurish, but very useful","The movie has a 'home video' feel, and yet it is a very useful tool for anybody who has in mind to climb Aconcagua along the ""Falso de los Polacos"" route (see Secor's guidebook for more details on the route). I watched the movie several times before actually climbing the mountain, and found it extremely useful. It gives an idea of the challenges one will have to face (mostly altitude, and weather). It is regrettable that the movie does not have any scene filmed in the Canaleta, the crux of the climb along the Normal route (and the Falso route connects with the Normal route a few hours below the Canaleta). Also, the movie does not show any use of crampons, though on summit day it is often necessary to use them to cross a snow field after Independencia, as well as on the Schiller ice just before the Canaleta. All in all, however, a really enjoyable, stimulating, and somewhat inspiring movie."
2,Lack lustre home video,"You have to give them full credit for trying, its not easy to take a camera up a big hill for 2 weeks, but for people with some climbing or trekking experience this film is likely to prove a disapointment.Our tape quality was not good, and there were few moments of apparent elation, suspense, or any other of the good ingredients that go into a compelling documentary experience.Like the reviewer below, our tape also broke (snapped actually), after a couple of months and just 3 or 4 showings.Try and catch the National Geographic TV doco on the Australian guiding company ""Field Touring"", who took a group up in 1999, that was a very real and compelling drama, and its free...."
2,not good,"We saw a copy of our friends before going on the second Field Touring filmed trip last year. It didnt really tell the story of climbing aconcagua, but I guess it is different for us as we have been there. The Field Touring film is being sold to cable tv, its pretty good by all accounts but not purchasable from them. (Probably on National Geographic) you can try to contact , their version was shot over 3 years and is a very compete account of the climb - I think we are even on it!!"
2,Chapters incorrectly cut,"This is one of my most favorite and most watched Chinese movies. I decided to buy a copy of its DVD.Unfortunately, this DVD version on Amazon has incorrectly cut chapters. The sequence of the chapters are totally messed up.I recommend this movie, but I won't recommend this specific DVD."
2,Messed Up Chapters,"Agree with movie345. Having read the story (both CHN and ENG), the disjointed jumping around is disappointing. How that could happen I'm not sure, but it sure is sloppy. Looks like I'm going to have to edit/re-arrange. What a pain in the ass. Subtitles are amateurish as well, but that's about par for the course."
5,Gay Street by Jack Mauro,"The reader is offered the opportunity to put his eye behind Mr. Mauro's creative lens in order to examine the author's ""catalog of possibilities."" The insights into the human predicament are mesmerizing.His characters are caringly wrapped in poetic prose which carries them from street corner to street corner, back and forth across Gay Street.I would not attempt to select a favorite story because each thrives in the buzzing cluster to which it attaches."
3,"Not terribly helpful, a little limited","This book was more about the love story than the grieving, and it did not help my mother much in trying to understand, accept, and eventually overcome her grieving.Judy Conrad"
3,Grieving: a love story,"This book was highly recommended to me after I lost my husband. Probably later on I'll be able to use it. At this stage, it is not the kind a book that I am ready to read and apply. I'm keeping it on the shelf for a couple of months and probably will find it helpful then."
2,DVI-out doesn't work,"Just a warning, if you're planning on buying this card to use it's DVI-out with an LCD monitor.*It doesn't work.*It didn't work with my Viewsonic VP181 LCD monitor, and many others have reported to Hercules' tech support that the DVI-out wouldn't work with their LCD monitors either.Symptoms are green and white ""snow"" all over the display, flickering, and darkening/lightening of the display.Hercules' tech support has yet to acknowledge the problem, let alone provide a fix for it.Analog output seems to work just fine, but buyer beware if you want this card for its DVI-out."
1,"DVI, HIGH power Requirements","This card is fast, but there are some serious problems...1. DVI does not work with Viewsonic, Princeton, or the Apple Cinema Display pictured on the box. This has been confirmed by tech support.2. This card is power hungry, and is not recomended for a MB with a linear power supply. (not stated anywhere until you call tech support)3. UNSTABLE. Lets face it, 2 bios revision and 5 drivers releases in 2 weeks? Houston, we have a problem.It is fast, but don't expect to run all of your games with one set of drivers. If swapping drivers to play different games, editing the registry to turn values on and off is your thing, go for it.I got 3 of them to see if it was a bad card I got, 1 mail order, 1 best buy, 1 compusa. No 2 cards would do the same thing, heck you can't even run the demos out of the box without crashing.."
1,BAD CARD,"This is a very bad card, no one of my games can run with it :-\Very very very very bad card..."
5,Good for all golfers who want to be in better shape,"I thought this book had all the information I needed to be in better shape and more flexible, stronger, and more motivated to reach my fitness goals for golf"
5,"If you want to feel great again, read this book","As someone who wanted to drop a few pounds and feel better about himself, I read this book with the expectation of looking better, feeling better, and playing a ""stronger"" game of golf. In regard to looking and feeling better, this book has helped me with my energy and allowed me to avoid feeling as tired as I play throughout my rounds. If I had read this book a few years ago, I would playing well above my expecations."
1,Weak Attempt at a Difficult Subject,"In my estimation, part of the reason golfers don't exercise is the lack of good information. By good information, I mean how this will help me without hindering my swing mechanics. Well, this isn't it and I was very disapointed in the book in that each chapter was more like an introduction than a real chapter."
1,Not Strong Enough on Strength!,"I am a teaching pro who lifts a lot for golf, and found this less than adequate in the strength area. I try to mix different forms of training and this didn't give me any new ideas. The cover promised a good deal more than the book delivered."
5,Awesome book for golfers and those who want to feel great!,"If I had known that doing some of the exercises that are in this book would help my golf swing as they have, I would be playing on the PGA Tour by now. I have never felt better and know that it is because of the exercise methods in Don Tinder's book! This book is written for those golfers who are skeptical about taking the time to exercise, as I was. But after reading the chapter on motivation, and taking the time to do the stretching exercises from Chapter Four, ""Stretching Your Limits"", I have more control over my swing and feel better, too!!! My mental approach to the game is much more clearer and focused!! Thanks Don, for helping me find the player that I knew was inside of me!!"
1,Another fitness trainer jumps on the bandwagon and falls off,"Very weak attempt at covering weight training for golf, I already do more in the gym than this book suggests. Nutrition chapter was especially disappointing"
1,Poor attempt at golf exercise,"Eventhough it's not a golf book, Getting Stronger is a much better guide to weight training for golf than this book."
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution/Writing Style","This book had alot of promise on my first fast reading. However, the more I looked at it, the more I found the format less than optimal, such as poorly-placed or photographed exercises. Also,in writing style, way too quick on the explanations without some significant back-up(sorry, the author quoting himself in the reference section extensively is not good). The information looked like a quick complilation of some basic exercise books I have on general fitness, and then added the word ""golf."""
5,This is a GREAT GUIDE FOR GOLFERS WHO WANT TO STAY FIT!,"I follow the recommendations in this book and feel great. I don't want to be bored with useless information, and this book hits at the heart of what to do both in the gym and on the golf course. The author has motivated me to work out again! Thanks Don!"
3,A bit concerned at pre-use,"This beanie baby is okay. My concern is that it is obviously not brand new in the sense that you can tell it has been handled quite a bit. It is not stated on the order page that the item is not brand new. I am a bit disgusted and will not give it as a gift, but will wash it and give it to Goodwill rather than spend the money to return it."
4,DUKE STRIKES IT RICH WITH ANOTHER CLASSIC!,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. A great movie with all the elements of a Duke classic: fist fights, Indians, love affairs, drunken debacle and tom foolery. Duke is at his best with his one liners and Joe cool attitude. Wayne's character in the movie (Dan) has shades of Wayne's characters in ""Red River"" and ""The Searchers"" Dan is so intent on getting 10,000 gallons of oil to Oklahoma, that he'll do it at any price. He'll starve his men and forgo their dinners. It takes the reason of a woman, Cathy (Martha Scott) to help Dan to not only think of a means to an end, but others' well being as well.I highly recommend this movie. Ranks right up there with my favorites, ""Red River"" ""El Dorado"" ""The Comancheros"" and ""Hondo""Simply a classic...."
2,Buyer Be-Aware,"You need to know that this is NOT a professionally produced DVD. Rather it is a burned (copied) DVD using a DVD-R. (Another reviewer questions the ""legality"" of this DVD but I don't know anything about this.) The DVD label and case insert are poorly done. The quality of the actual movie is fine and compares to other old B&W movies of the time that have been released on DVD. This is a good (not great) early John Wayne movie. My only concern is about the quality of the DVD that was used to burn this movie. Is it a high quality DVD or not? I don't know. So, how long will this DVD actually last. That remains to be seen. But, alas, this is apparently the only way to get War of the Wildcats (aka In Old Oklahoma). So, I would give the movie at least 3 stars, but the DVD only 2."
1,Cheap packaging,"The front and back cover of this product look like they were printed off a cheap home printer. The back cover has four lines containing the Title, Studio, Release Date, and Disc. These lines aren't formatted properly and parts of the words are chopped off."
1,Outdated book,Not really relevant in 2012. Would look elsewhere for more insight into tomorrow's culture. This guy is clearly not a current church goer.
5,Tears of Saints,"Anyone who is interested in sober and sincere philosophy is a must to read. If you did enjoy Wittgenstein, Russell- you will like Cioran."
1,But it only if you wish to complete your Elvis CD's....,"This was the first Elvis soundtrack I bought when it originally was for sale and I took it back to the record store with a white lie or two that it was defective sound-wise. It really was! Not so much the actual sound, but the crap they put out on record disguised as a record. I bought this only to see if I was correct in my original assessment bacvk in the sixties and to complete my Presley collection. I must have mellowed in my old age (64) as it's not so objectable to my ears as when I was younger. Still some really crappy songs and it just bothers the hell out of me that they actually speeded up the theme song ""Girl Happy"" rather than record it and release it at it's proper speed. By it only if you're having flash-backs of your younger years! Garbage is garbage!"
3,"BUY SONGS INDIVIDUALLY, NOT THE WHOLE SOUNDTRACK","APPROACH ELVIS MOVIE SOUNDTRACKS CAREFULLY.IF YOU WANT TO BUY SONGS FROM THIS MOVIE, I SUGGEST LISTENING TO EACH TRACK ON AMAZON AND BUYING THEM ONE BY ONE. DON'T GET BURNED WITH THE FILLER MATERIAL THAT RCA GAVE ELVIS FORCED TO RECORD.PROBLEM WITH ELVIS SOUNDTRACKS (NOT ELVIS HIMSELF) IS THE MATERIAL HE WAS GIVEN, AND THE SONGS WERE WRITTEN FOR THE SITUATION IN THE FILM, AND NOT INTENED TO BE MORE THAN THAT.THE 2 GREAT SONGS ON THIS SOUNDTRACK ARE GIRL HAPPY & PUPPET ON A STRING. THE REST ARE FUN SONGS AND WORK WELL IN THE MOVIE, BUT TO LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK AS IF ALL THE SONGS WERE HITS, IS NOT FOR MOST MUSIC LISTENERS, ONLY HARDCORE ELVIS FANS.I WOULD APPROACH ALL OF THE SOUNDTRACKS THIS WAY."
3,"""What a crazy, way-out way to be!""","How do you review an album with songs such as ""Do the Clam,"" ""Wolf Call,"" and ""Do Not Disturb?"" Well, a sense of humor helps! Actually, this album deserves 2.5 stars, not three, but Amazon forces its reviewers to round up or down a star, and all things being Elvis, we give the higher score. If nothing else, the first three tracks -- ""Girl Happy,"" ""Spring Fever,"" and the goofy ""Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce"" (YOU try rhyming ""courts"" with ""thoughts!"") -- are fun film throwaways and still rate a cut-above what was to come later that year, the truly awful HARUM SCARUM soundtrack! The understated ""Puppet on a String"" is the lone classic to be found here; ""The Meanest Girl in Town,"" ""Startin' Tonight,"" and ""I've Got to Find My Baby"" are so generic they barely warrant the term ""filler.""As usual, BMG muffs the original album art, but it's nice to finally have a clutch of these Elvis soundtrack albums available as individual spinners."
4,A Must For the HP PS 100,This paper makes fantastic borderless prints on the HP PS 100!We bought a PS 100 and a pack of this for use at a family reunion. The results were simply amazing. We are a photo crazy family and had digital cameras ranging from .3 Meg (640x480) to 3.3 Meg resolution and were able to print pictures (right from the media card - no PC) that rivaled professional prints.Pros:Prints are sharp and clearPaper stock is fairly heavyCons:Fairly expensive per pageTab does not always remove cleanly (hint - bend tab forward then backward for cleaner removal)This is wonderful paper!
3,"Produces very good pictures, but fragile surface","The picture quality is decent from this paper, but I have lost a few pictures from handling.They bend much easier than standard photopaper, and scratch easily. Best thing to do is let them dry and put them in an album or separated by soft paper in a photobox right away."
1,Read the fine print!,I thought that I was getting 20 sheets of 8 1/2 x 11 photo paper but they turned out to be 4 x 6 in size. I don't think the ad made this clear.
1,Not What I Expected,"This is 4 inch by 6 inch. If you want 8.5 inch by 11 inch, don't buy this product. Sure, I realize you can scan through all the info and find it is 4 inch by 6 inch, but it is not right out in front where it should be. I did not return this, as it was my mistake, but ... did not make it easy for me to see that it was not the size I wanted. I have no doubt they would be glad to take it back, so this is not a comment on their return policy."
2,neck problems,"I have been using the great body super stomach with Debra Crocker. (1985) The new super stomach is too hard on your neck. She uses exercises that use too much of your neck. Now, I know your not suppose to pull your neck but it's hard when you do so many reps. The old one is so much better. Your using your shoulder blades to hold almost all the time and when you do hold you neck, she tells you how not to put pressure. Was not happy with the instructor."
3,"great for the abs, awful for the arms",This workout video is great for getting your stomach firm; I always feel like I have really worked my stomach after I do the video. Super Stomach is a name that fits perfectly. The worst thing about it was it made my arms severly tired. It was also sort of a strain on my neck.
4,My favorite exercise video!!!,"I used this video back in the 80's it worked then and it still works...if you work it :). I use italong with other exerice videos to trick my body. I will always be a big fan of this workout tape, it works for me!"
5,excellent CD,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. He saw the Seldom Scene several times during the 70's and he was so happy to get this CD. It takes him back to those carefree days of his youth!
2,Clips make Stroller too wide,"I ordered this bar to go on my Baby Jogger City Series Double Jogger. The clips snapped on easy enough, the only problem is that when I go shopping the clips make the stroller too wide to fit through a standard size door. I kept trying different angles, but the clips snapped off every time. O well, live and learn..."
5,Great Guitar Book!,"When I first buy a music book, I usually do a quick read and play-through to see how I like the songs and will mark a little dot next to the title in the front contents page. If it comes with a CD I might just skim through the CD. I found myself marking nearly every song in this book. there are some very beautiful pieces in various celtic styles. I like that each song has a little note about the piece and where the author found the selected pieces."
4,Used to be one of the best books on Transformational Grammar,"John Grinder studied Transformational Grammar at large during the late 60s and early 70s (he did his Ph.D with Chomsky). During the 70s he was an assistant professor at the University of California in Santa Cruz. He now is better known as one of the co-creators of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a domain in which you'll find his name mentioned in many books, either as co-author, or somewhere in the book...(for other reviews on NLP, see www.7EQ.com/books )"
4,Great camera but beware first.......,".....the machine will only work with a serial port on your computer. We had just bought a new Compaq notebook computer and I figured this camera was a perfect Xmas present for Jill. Woe is me! No serial port on the Compaq. Now I'm scrambling for all the stuff it takes to hook the thing up. Probabl solution: a new color printer with a slot to insert the memory card, thereby bypassing the computer entirely.In summary: check your port first."
5,Intuitive...,"The best personal digital camera for the money. Kodak should have never discontinued this camera. I've used it in the construction industry and the military prior to that. It's been rained on, snowed on, in the desert and in the mountains. I've tried other Kodak's but this is the one for me. Keep the prices low, pretty soon I'll have 5 of them. Thanks!"
1,Battery Tray Breaks Easily,"Battery carriage breaks easily. I now have to use duct tape to keep the battery carriage closed and that works for about one day. I'm not the only one with the problem. Check out eBay -- lots of these cameras are up for sale, but with a broken battery carriage."
2,Unreliable for heavy useage,"I've had my camera for a year and a half. Since I'm a real estate appraiser, I take lots and lots of pictures and have found this camera to be less than reliable. During the first year the ""zoom"" assembly failed and had to be repaired. Fortunatly it was still under warranty. On damp days the camera often would not operate properly. The battery compartment is flimsy and most everyone I know has theirs secured with rubber bands. Often times when I got back to my office, pictures which showed up on the LCD as takes, just weren't there. The best feature of this camera is it's metal body, light weight and good picture quality. Maybe just for home use, this would be a good camera."
3,Minor Problems,"One problem I came across: Many times, not always, after I press the Shutter button, the LCD shows the picture with the delete icon, I believe unless I want to delete it, I should just wait for the camera to keep this picture and be ready for the next one. However, the LCD goes off. I have to press the ""do it"" button to bring back the LCD preview to be ready for the next one. (My batteries are charged). Is this normal? Need to ask Kodak. Meanwhile, if you know the answer, email to jeng2000@ureach.com"
2,Decent if you like huge heavy clunky cameras,"This body design is so outdated, it is not worth the price at all. It is huge and heavy. The performance isn't bad, but one problem I had (I owned 2 - not because I liked it so much but my company uses them) and I had the same problem on both of them - the battery compartment won't stay closed and you have to hold it closed with tape. Also, sometimes it will have a brain fart and the screen will go all snowy, and you will be snapping pictures but they aren't taking, even though it appears that they are. But when you go back to review them, they aren't there. I also had this problem on both cameras but it wasn't as common - it only happened about 3-4 times over a year period (and I use the camera almost daily). The battery life is pretty good - I can usually get 75 or so pics out of it before I have to recharge the batteries. But I would not really recommend it since there are definitely other models out there that are much better for this price."
4,Great Camera,"I received this camera for my birthday and really like it a lot. It's a big upgrade from the Casio QV-11 I was using.What makes this camera great? Well, it is very easy to use. It's simple to change the settings, uplink to your PC and use in general. And the results are really top notch.It also feels much more durable and is nicer to handle than comparable models made by Olympus, Canon and Minolta.The way I have the camera set up, it takes 35 pictures at a very nice resolution and quality on the 4MB Compact Flash card that is included. I just bought the 16MB Flash because I'm using the camea so much, so keep in mind that at some point you may be dropping another $40-50 on memory, as the amount that comes with the DC-215 is passable, but not spectacular."
2,Poor color accuracy with the DC215,"Feature are limited, but not bad for an entry level camera. The big deficiency with this camera is color accuracy. Color intensity and accuracy (particularly with greens) is terrible---really substandard. In fact, color accuracy is much worse than my old Olympus D-400L that this was meant to replace. I have since seen the same complaints mentioned in reviews of this camera in various PC magazines.Not recommended."
2,Poor quality product,"I have owned my DC215 for about two years, and I have several gripes about its quality.* Occasionally, the flash will go off an instant after the picture is taken.* After a year and a half, it started powering itself off randomly. Now it does this all the time.* It tends to scramble the order of the pictures in its memory. Occasionally I've had pictures disappear.* The viewfinder doesn't accurately represent the picture that is taken, so if you rely on the outlines in the viewfinder, you tend to cut people's heads off.Overall, it's a semi-decent camera, but I'd recommend choosing something else."
4,Kodak DC215 Battery compartment,"Yes, i really have thought this camera has been great for the two years I have owned it...until my battery compartment wont stay in the camera any more after the tiny plastic clip holding it in has snapped!"
2,I thought Kodak would be higher quality,"Admittedly this is the low end of the Kodak line, but even keeping this in mind I was disappointed with the picture quality with my DC215. Furthermore, after about 3 months the flash developed a nasty habit of going off a half second after the picture is taken. I would recommend either a different brand, or a higher-end camera."
3,It helps,This definitely keeps my bread fresher longer. The down side is that its hard to get the loaf of bread inside.
4,Rubbermaid Bread Storage Container,The container itself is great. The only downfall is the new containers don't have the slide-out tray the old containers had... Bummer
3,Not as described,"Its a little bigger than what I thoght. The tray that goes inside the keeper does not come with the product, at least in my order."
5,Rubbermaid Item,I love this product. It holds all of the different size bread items I purchase. It keeps it fresh and safe. It also travels well and keeps the bread from being squished.
4,As Described,"I bought this keeper to replace a large Rubbermaid box we were using for bread and pastry-type things. This container is perfect for holding large loaves of bread, and has a nice tight seal. The long line of the keeper gives me more space on top of the fridge where we keep our bread. More space is always good. I will buy one of these again and would recommend to friends and family."
2,bread loaf container,Was looking for a loaf container for bread-machine loaves. This is strictly for store-bought bread loaves. It is less convenient than the plastic bag and twist tie. Not sure where it would be benificial.
3,disappointed,This loaf keeper is great for sandwich loaf style bread. My only draw back is that you can not bring the wrapper onto the plastic and slide it over. The keeper is way too wide. So it is kind a pointless to use it. Having to dig down into the keeper and get your bread.
2,RE: I laughed while I learned this DRY subject,"This review above was obviously written by the makers of the product. Is the video series funny? No. ...More interesting than some of my business classes? Yes. Worth $100? Are you kidding? No, maybe $40. Each topic is only about 10 minutes long, so this is hardly a ""compilation."" Overall a good concept and product, but again not worth 100 bones."
4,Muy práctico,"Un libro muy bueno, que tiene mucha información útil. No me gustó que el índice es poco claro por lo que cuesta encontrar algunas preguntas puntuales."
4,"Un buen libro, aunque la traducción es muy sencilla","El libro es bueno, aunque la traducción es muy sencilla (Supongo que en parte porque muchos términos en Español varían dependiendo del país). A veces es un poco repetitivo conforme se pasa de mes a mes, pero al menos eso permite que alguién pueda aprovechar el libro sin tener que leerlo todo desde el principio.El mejor valor agregado se obtiene leyendo el libro incluso desde antes que nace tu bebe, para aprovechar los consejos y tips. Sin embargo, todo bebe es único, y además se debe siempre dar prioridad a los pediatras y médicos."
3,Buyer beware you may not get Blue as pictured,I am only giving this item 3 starts because of the product I received. Here I am in the rush of the Christmas season and I didn't read the entire page where it says assorted colors. I ordered this for my brother thinking I was going to get what was pictured (a blue one) and I got a pink one. So not cool. and now I cant order another one before I leave for Christmas. What a bummer to put a pink item in the box and put an I owe you in there too. So disappointing. If they have assorted colors available why not let the person choose??? instead of surprise here is one you dont want that you just paid money for. again so disappointing!
3,Nice coverage but....,"These toothbrushes seem to do a nice job. They are very full brushes so they cover the tooth area very well. However, they loose bristles. Bristles get stuck between my teeth, in my gums, etc. This is a real pain in the neck. I've used them daily for about a month and they still loose bristles."
2,definitely - Don't buy it!,"I changed my review from 5 stars to just 2 - the reason? I had one which was awesome,it was made in Italy, these brushes are made in China;the bristles are nice, but the handle!it's almost square, painful to hold,there is no curvature to it making it very awkward to brush. Shame on Swisco for cheapening the design."
4,I really needed this book,"Several months of being WAY stressed out and I decided to take a little stoll in the self help section to come across this book. I read it in only a few days (put it down/picked it up). It made me laugh out loud a few times. I'm now searching for more things from this author (I never knew she was out there). Several other women in my life are in bad relationships...this book made me think...what the heck are you doing in an unhappy situation? Life IS short. Why do we waste our time stressing ourselves out instead of enjoying life? And the mention of getting angry over being caught in traffic, etc...that was me. She makes you want to sit back, relax, and enjoy the little things around you that you never notice because you are in too big of a rush."
4,Life Is Short-Wear Your Party Pants...,"I felt this book was an easy to read, motivating simple reminder that being to serious in life is pointless. But LaRoche's humorous approach is what is really unique and very refreshing."
4,Fun Read,"This was a fun read. It helped me to change my perspective on stress and how I deal. I think I am ready to do more of my own work to reduce my stress and improve my quality of life, but I would definately recommend this this book to anyone suffering from stress and anxiety"
2,Cute title story is too little for most.,"If the book's title and the story behind the title were typed on one sheet of paper, you could post it and read it often to remind yourself that life is short, so live every day. For a few of us, that is how shallow most of our problems really are and therefore we probably do not need this book, just that one story. For many, however, their problems are real, their stress is real, and they are looking for real answers to help them live every day. Unfortunately, they will not find them in this book. Little depth and even less understanding or acknowledement of the real pain in people's lives leaves a ""cutesy"" book but not much help."
3,Humor and funny,"I liked the book it is very funny, but not life changing. Loretta explains life in a very funny way, even with complex problem."
1,"Earring Organizer fails - Hard to use, holes too small.",This item is hard to use. I have since taken out all the earrings and put them in another jewelry box. The holes are very small and hard to put the earrings in and take out. Who has that much time?
3,Holds a lot of studs,"This holds tons of studs, and some small dangles, but don't expect 210 pairs to fit if you have a lot of large dangles or hoops, also some hoops will not go on here becuase they do not fit when you slide it back into place."
1,Terrible quality,Product is plastic and terrible quality. Earrings are very hard to get in and out of holes and you must be careful that you don't bend the back of your earring.Very poor customer service from Stacks and Stacks. It took two months to for them to credit my account after I returned the item back to them.
4,earring holder,"I really enjoy the design of this organizer and the fact that so many earrings can be put in such a small space. Just wish it had arrived in one piece. The packing was faulty and it arrived with a large crack in the side and one of the holders had a crack. I received a discount for this item instead of returning it as it was an overstock item and the only one available from this ""warehouse deal."""
4,Almost perfect,This is almost the perfect solution to my earring storage. The only drawbacks that I have found are that the holes are a little too close together for many earrings and certain pairs don't fir at all.Of course you must be diligent about replacing the earrings on the rack.
4,Great Item -- Room for improvement,"I am trying to get my 30-year collection of earrings under control. Like previous reviews indicated this will hold 210 pairs of small post earrings and you will lose storage space with larger posts and dangles. This product could be redesigned to hold more panels by adding more slots to the main holder. Just by adding more slots with additional storage panels you could add another 100 pairs of earrings. However, I am happy that I purchased this item because it is allowing me to find earrings that went ""missing"" in my jewelry armoire. If the company ever redesigns it as indicated above, I will purchase another one without hesitation."
1,I could not keep up,I am familiar with the basic crochet stitches. I wanted to learn how to create the stitches from this dvd. I watched for a while and tried working along. I could not keep up with the teacher.
5,Crochet Like a Pro!!!,"Crochet Stitches in Motion was perfect for a newbie to crocheting like me because the ""Basic Refresher"" section brought me right up to speed. This dvd has a ton of projects and the step-by-step instructions makes it sooo easy to learn even the more challenging patterns. Even though I've only had this dvd for a few weeks I feel like I've learned enough to venture out and explore my own project ideas. Crochet Stitches in Motion is a tremendous resource, go and buy it NOW!"
1,BEWARE!!! FAKE REVIEWS!!,"Click on ""see all my reviews"" next to each reviewers name and you will notice that 99% of them reviewed identical books, all with GLOWING reviews. All of the books ""reviewed"" by the posters are from Leisure Arts. Coincidence? I think not. Because of these false reviews I will NOT purchase anything from Leisure Arts. Making their own reviews, puh-leeeeeease!"
1,Why,"Thats right WHY!!!! There is no reason to put up with this kind of problem. Ink sticks to plastic, glass and even each other if you put one picture on top of another. Ha!!!! Get out a hair dryer and dry the ink...Why Hp is giving this paper away when you buy ink, and the 4x12's,,,buy 1 and they will give you 1 free!!!!!!Why!!!! because the paper sucks,,, Don't buy it I'm sending mine back for a refund or for a paper that works I really have to laugh when I look at the pics and can't understand WHY people would try to talk themselves into using this paper. Mabe if you put tape on the back of the pic and hang them on a line you could look at them this way. Let me read what it says on the 110 vivera ink Brilliant, long-lasting. NOW! Water- and smudge- resistant prints. This is the kind of mix-match that the company's tell you can happen when you use aftermarket paper or inks. Shame on you HP"
5,Every new scientist should have it!,"Oversized, with lifelike illustrations that are so much more appealing (and detailed) than photos. Paper is that attractive coated semi-matte that stays bright and clean. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent product,I wish I had discovered these sooner! I started skating a couple of months ago and was struggling with upper side of the skates boot pushing on the tendon in the ankle. These pads protect the whole ankle area by providing a thin (but sufficient) layer of gel. It is basically a tube that is padded with gel on the inside. This has allowed my sore ankles to heal while continuing skating. It is a must for anyone struggling with new skates (mine are Jackson figure skates and notorious for being hard to break in). The pads are a bit expensive but worth the money.
5,Love!!,"My son complains every 5 min pre-bunga, when I got these for him... ta-da.... no more complaints. His words, ""mom, this is sooo comfortable"". Saves me from readjusting his boots every 10 min... no kidding."
2,Disappointed,"While the product overall seemed to be high quality, I was very disappointed to learn that my 35 lb border collie bent the 'extra sturdy' wire the first day we had it, making it unable to be used any longer. I would recommend this extra large kennel for a small breed who wants lots of room, but not for any dog who shows much strength."
4,Nice Ride,I found this to be really fun ride. From the start right through to the end it tells the story of a fairly inept soldier and his rise to an assasin...even if he doesn't want to be. The only reason he can even be an assasin is because of this POWERFUL magic sword a wizard made him...and the wizard was upset with him at the time....I found the dilemas Valdor experienced to be quite an unusual take on the subject of fantasy. Usually it is cruel Lords and evil Ladies...I found the more mundane elements he had to contend with a refreshing take....
5,One of the Best Ever,"This has got to be one of the best fantasy books i have ever read. Watt-Evans has a real talent writing books about believable heros with realistic problems without losing that fantasy touch! quite unusual, let me tell you. Watt-Evans writes like this frequently, and his newest book, ""Dragon Weather"" is also good. But this is his best."
4,Enjoyable stuff.,"I don't always see Lawrence Watt-Evans' books on the shelves, and I think it's a shame. The basic plotline(ordinary guy thrust into extraordinary situations) isn't new, but along the way we get a lot of exciting adventure, interesting magic, and a sense of humor. A fun story, and a good read. Try it!"
3,Read this book as child,"I liked Watt-Evans' ""The Lords of Dus"" reasonably well as a child, so decided to try this book. Turns out, I had also read this as child. Though the writing is simplistic, the premise of the story is interesting and one of the few books that I continued thinking about long after I had read it. I enjoyed it more when I was younger."
5,Look and feel fabulous,"These shoes are great! They look good and are very comfortable, even for all-day dashing around the office!"
5,I loved this book,I want this book to be required reading for any sports fan. It exposes the enormous pressure Major Taylor endured and demonstrates why his was one of the USA's greatest athletes. It is disheartening that so few know his name. Every bike rider needs to know this story. One of the best biking books I have read.
5,A Mind-Blowing Experience,"This is the most incredibly entertaining book I have ever read. You will pick it up years later, and see new details. The strange, surreal landscapes depicted will entertain you and open your eyes to new sensations. Ellison's commentary is often effective in showing you a new perspective, but don't buy the book for the literature: buy it for the art. The detail Yerka uses with his art will create an indellible mark upon your conciousness. Highly, highly recoommended!"
4,Kindle Version Review,"This is prime 1950s-era Nero Wolfe and well worth a read. Not only is Stout's writing here vital and pithy, but the plot takes some memorable twists and Nero has to adjust his strategy accordingly. There are some great Archie/Nero character moments and some nice use of the Saul Panzer-led squad of hired investigators. The Kindle version is well-formatted, but note the cover is missing and the publishing date, ISBN, etc., appears at the end of the text instead of the beginning."
4,Getting better -- much better,"This is my second Nero Wolfe book, and I'm getting the message. Wolfe's an eccentric; Archie is someone I'd love to meet; the stories carry me along. The denouement in this book is not exactly shocking, but I'm getting into the rhythm of Stout's writing and plan to keep going with more stories until I'm hooked -- or not."
4,Mistaken Identities,"A hunt for a missing son turns into a deeper mystery when it seems that their long lost might be the accused in a murder trial.Archie goes to bat to find out who really killed the caddish husband, eating well and charming the ladies along the way.As is usual for Nero Wolfe books, witty and well-written. Not an exceptional series entry, but a solid example of what makes them entertaining. Suitable for either Wolfe novices or people familiar with the series."
4,wow man .HARD,"not bein into gabba or hard/speedcore,. i was gettin bored with my flatmate playin gabba,. ... until i heard NYC speedcore. buy this record.your life will be better.."
3,Fun but not durable,"I got this for my 5 year old daughter when she was 4 years old. She was so excited to get it and it was very, very cute. She immediately, with my help, decorated the jewelry box with all the decorations provided. Soon after the skirt decoration kept coming unstuck. For a few months we were able to just push the skirt back onto the little stickers and it would stay for awhile but eventually it came off completely. After that all the other little decorations began to fall off to. This was about a year ago and now the music box is still in great condition and plays music but most of the decorations we added are gone. So it is fun to decorate, but don't expect it to last."
2,Mom and Daughter Dissapointed,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we had a lot of fun decorating the box. The only problem is that nothing stayed on, the pink netting fell off within a couple of days, the sticker gems were falling off. I tried to re-glue using a hot glue gun and they still fell off. Right now, there are 3 pink gems left on the top and that's it. I would not buy this item again."
2,Not a practical guide to the transport pricing of electricity,"This book is a collection of papers by academics on the transport pricing of electricity networks. I think this book would be mainly of interest to academics working in the same field. Certainly you would probably need a graduate level of education or equivalent in economics to make sense of the work. This is not really a book for those looking for practical guidance on the transmission or distribution pricing of electricity. Also the book isn't good value for money. I might expand this review later with more detailed comments, but in short my feeling is that only academics would get much value out of it, everyone else should look elsewhere for guidance in this area."
3,Great Camera when it Decides to Work,"I've had the camera for a couple of years now. I sent it back to Fuji when it was under warranty because it had a hard time recognizing the SmartMedia card. They fixed it promptly. Then I sent it to their repair company in California when it decided to turn itself off randomly. They fixed it and it worked for a while. Now it is acting up again.Now I love the results I get from the camera, but I wish it would work when I want it to instead of when it wants to.I'm about to send it in for repair under the warranty from the previous repair. If that doesn't work, I think I'll give up."
4,Great Pictures while on Manual Mode,"When I first bought this camera (2 years ago) I used the 'Auto' and'Portrait' settings. I found myself taking average quality picturesthen proceeded with the manual setting and the whole perspective onthis camera changed, all I can say is WOW.The camera consumes a lot of battery so make sure you are carryinga fast charger and at least 3 sets (2 each) of fresh batteries.I often have problems with the selector changing the picture modefrom auto to manual or portrait without me turning it. I oftenlose shots while previewing them.Would've I buy Fuji again ? Maybe, the competition is a lotbetter than 2 years ago and unbelieveable prices ..."
4,Follow up to earlier review,"Earlier I reported that the AVI's were not 100% compatible and that friends I sent them to were not able to play them.I spoke to Fuji tech support tonight and they indicate that you must use Quicktime to view the 4700's AVI files. Not a big problem if you know ahead of time.Still very happy with the camera. With the new ... price, it is really attractive now!"
2,Disapointing,"I bought it becouse it looked good and had good specs, but here is what I found out!* Optics distort streight lines. and make them curved* Pictures during the day are superb, as soon as it becomes twilight the camera can not focus properly and about 50% of the pictures are useless as they are misfocused.* Claims of 4.x Megapixels are marketing ploy as the CCD is 2.4Megapixel* Batery life is OK, I have seen better."
1,"""Pop"" goes the zoom lens...","Worked great for 1.5 years. Then, this weekend, after taking a perfectly sharp picture, the zoom lense (I kid you not) FELL OFF the camera! Turns out there are 3 tiny little stubs that hold the zoom lens to the camera body. Somehow, two of those stubs eroded, and my camera now an expensive LCD display unit. ...So, other than the fact that I'll never buy another Fuji, here is my assessment:When it decides to focus correctly ...you get AWESOME pics.Blue eye reduction worked well, but really ate the (NiMH) batteries."
1,Focus error,"My Fuji Finepix4700 has been workink fine for 2 years but now it shows problems with the optical zoom. The error message ""focus error"" is deplayed in the display."
5,Watch out for this feature,"This camera has an 80 sec Video feature in JPEG format. That means you can play the video back on your PC. However, to play it back on your TV, make sure you buy the camera with the right format. In the USA the TV format is NTSC, whilst the rest of the world uses the PAL format. Look on the side of the packaging for the correct format when you buy, as it in not indicated on the camera itself."
2,Small Camera - Big problems,"This camera is amazing, great pictures, convenient size. However, the lens cover has a tendency to get jammed and the lens will not come out leaving the camera inoperable. I have three friends who have this camera and have run into the exact same problem."
1,Manufacture Poor Warranty Coverage (Lense got Stuck),"Lense on camera have zoom problem, given msg ""focus error"" where it cost camera to stop function, will not retract or focus either with the camera on or off. Lense will not retract into place (stuck). Warranty is cover only if you provide receipt of purchase or fill out the warranty card. Unfortunately, I don't have neither, so there're no warranty for me even though I provided the serial No. on the camera."
5,Fujitastic!,"Bought for no messing, straight forward family pics and this little beauty does the trick. The AVI feature is handy for a bit of live action, though the quality of picture and sound can never beat a dedicated movie camera. Buy it if you want a great quality no nonsense digital camera."
2,I DONT CARE FOR THIS CD,I BELIVE THAT THE SINGER OF THIS BAND IS TRYING TO BE HEAVIER AND MORE HARDCORE THAN HIS BAND CAN BE. I BELIVE IF THE SINGER WENT TO A HEAVIER BAND HE WOULD HAVE MORE SUCESS AND IF THE BAND FOND A MORE MELLO SINGER THE WOULD ALSO HAVE MORE SUCESS.
5,Great Addition To A Great Game.,"Anybody who has played Rush Hour must know the nice feeling you get when you finally pass the 40th puzzle, and the bad feeling you get when you realize that it is over. Well Rush Hour has made three expansion packs of 40 new challenges each. Each will sharpen you concentration an logic skills.Rush Hour Two comes with a Convertible Red Escape Car and 40 new challenges from Intermediate to Grand Master. Now Grand Master might sound scary but it's basically the same as Expert. The cool difference is that in some Challenges you have to clear Both escape cars to win. This is a wonderful addition to an already great game. Remember that you must own Rush Hour to use this expansion. A DEFINITE MUST BUY!"
3,It's not the best but it is usable.,"When using the scanner and documan software make sure you go into the scanning options and set the ISO for negatives that you are scanning. The film I use is ISO 400 speed film. I scanned without the ISO setting and with the ISO 400 setting and there is a significant difference! Anything other problems not caught can be fixed in the adobe photosuite software that comes with the scanner.Also, contact the manufacturer to have them send out there latest documan software and drivers. The most current ones are not shipped with the scanner.The power button is a little wobbly and I had to return the first one I bought becuase the power button got stuck inside the scanner. Be very careful when turning it on and off."
1,Tamarack Technologies 2400 FS Film Scanner,"Over all this scanner is OK. It does a good job scanning properly expoused negatives and slides while not breaking the bank. Plan on spending some time experementing with the settings before you find the best setting to produce quality scans. I was able to produce good quality 8x10 pics from scanned B&W and color negs & slides (ISO 50 & 100). Technical support responded to my e-mail within 1 hour and I was able to get updated drivers and DOCUMAN 3.0 witin 3 days. for the price, this is a good scanner for beginners."
1,Horrible scanner.,"This is bad news. Save your money! I considered many film scanners, and ultimately decided to spend a little more for a top notch Minolta Dimage scanner.This one is the WORST! It is cheap feeling and looking, scans VERY slowly and the images are often poor. There is no Digital ICE (needed after you scan to remove dust, scratches from imge that you cannot see when you place negative/slide for scanning.) This scanner is basically useless, unless you dont mind poor scans with ZERO quality.Spend a few more bucks and get a Minolta Dimage."
1,You get what you pay for!,"My first disappointment with this scanner was that I could never get it installed on my Win 2000 Pro PC. I was able to get it to work with Win 98 SE without a hitch. It worked great for a few weeks before I began noticing streaks in scans run at more than 1200 dpi. I contacted Tamarack and they acted like they had never seen this problem before. They sent me a replacement scanner that, once again, began streaking after a week or so. I think I was able to figure out what is going on: dust on the optical sensor. When I blast the sensor with canned air, the streaking is reduced, but not completely eliminated. Unless you live in a clean room, you will probably have dust streaking with this machine. I'd recommend this scanner for folks looking to do scans of less than 600 dpi where dust isn't as much of a problem."
2,multiple problems,"The scanner came with a bad power supply, so I don't know ifthe scanner itself actually works. There is no writtendocumentation for installing the USB driver -- you have tosearch the CD for it. The scanning software hangs if thescanner is connected via USB but is not powered on."
2,Inexpensive but disappointing,"I've owned this scanner for more than a year and have scanned hundreds of negatives and slides. It works, generally, but it does not do a consistently high-quality job. Many of my scans have horizontal streaks in them; sometimes I can get rid of them by shutting down the scanner, letting it cool, and then scanning all over again. But it doesn't always work. And keep in mind that the manufacturer is reportedly out of business. No support! This seems to be the cheapest negative and slide scanner on the market, but there are reasons that it is so inexpensive. Beware! You may not get what you pay for with this one, no matter how cheap."
2,Searching for HELP,"I bought the 2400 FS Film Scaner( Tamarack) two months ago, since very begining it hasn't work properly. I use DocuMan 2.07 and I'm searching for a version 3.0. I have scenned 300 slides with quite good result but negatives are unacceptable! Maybe version 3.0 will help? Where can I find it? I would be pleased with any help. Is the problem of dark edges tipical ?"
1,Revised Review,"After having used this product now for three days, I wish to amend my previous review. This product is a piece of junk. I am returning it. It seemed marginally OK at first, but more extended use has proven it to be absolutely frustrating and inadequate for any purpose. I am rating it one star only because there is no provision for a lower rating."
3,Tamarack Film Scanner a Mixed Bag,"This scanner does an excellent job, and at an almost unbelievably low price, but getting it up and running proved to be a challenge. The documentation is so minimal as to be useless, and the help files seem to apply only to flatbed scanners. Everything is written in less-than-perfect English, to make the matter a little more perplexing if a little more entertaining. I was never able to install the scanner as a USB device, even with the prompt and courteous help from their email support. I had to use it with the parallel interface.Once I had arrived at this point, however, I was most pleased with the performance. This scanner is much easier to use than the initial difficulties had made me fear. The scans are fairly quick and of excellent quality. The software is equally good--once you figure out how to use it. This scanner is a good bargain, and I would recommend it for most ordinary uses."
4,Wonderful Family Devotional,"Like other reviewers, my biggest beefs with this book are the outdated illustrations and the ""Thee/Thou/Thy"" prayers. But our kids seem to enjoy the lessons, and the 4 year old can easily answer the questions. I know he's really taking it in because he brings things up and asks me about them days and weeks later. We do this book at dinner, and as soon as my husband or I have a clean plate, my 3 year old pipes up, ""Read the Devotional!"" This is a great introduction to the faith for any family."
2,This might be a good guide for someone not knowing where to start,"I had to alter so much of what I was reading because I thought the author took so much liberty with her theology. I read through a lot of it on my own, but stopped after reading 5 days with my daughters. Reading the Bible has seemed to bring up all of the questions she is asking and answering, and I would rather just refer to other scripture passages to teach theology."
3,"""Sprightly, conversational style"" with KVJ?","I can understand that a book written in 1962 would quote the Bible from the King James Version. And it's ironic that I'm reading this book to my own children who are about the same age I was when the book was first written.But I'm disappointed that the publisher didn't update the quotes and hymns to reflect where children are today, perhaps a more ""sprightly, conversational""* translation and choruses the kids might hear most Sunday Schools? (* a quote from back cover describing this book)I'm sure we'll still be able to reap much of what was sown by the author for our children, by paraphrasing the KJV verses and singing simple choruses.Whither thou goest, let thy buyer bewareth."
4,A great book to teach small children basic bible truths.,"""Leading Little Ones to God"" by Marian M. Schoolland is a tremendous book for teaching small children basic bible truths. It answers typical questions little children would ask about God, what God requires of us, how one gets to heaven, etc. This book is great for bedtime reading. Originally published in 1962, this is a timeless classic for children's books about the Bible."
4,Great basis for kids' religious education,"I've been looking for a ""curriculum"" to use with home-churching my kids. This book should do the trick - each lesson has suggestions on readings, prayers, and hymns to go with it. Do a web search on the hymn music and you can have your own little church service in your home! Perfect for those who want to have more control over their kids' religious education or if you don't have a church with a good children's program near you."
4,A nice start to the day...,"This has been a great way to start the morning. If you have very little ones listening along with your school age children, it can be a a lot for them to try to grasp. (Our daughter (3) has gleaned some *interesting* ideas because she didn't fully understand the language.) The version of the bible used is full of thees and thous, and the discussion of sin is pretty heavy. It helped a lot when I explained that 'thee' and 'thou' were used to refer to people who were close to you, like family, since the perception is generally opposite on that one. Anyway, great resource, just be careful to take extra time with the very little ones."
5,Great book,This is a great book. I found it at the local library and liked it so much I ordered it. We use it as a family devotion book. The lessons are short enough that the kids don't get bored but still get a good devotion every night. There are discussion questions and suggested bible passages for every lesson.
4,Leading the wee ones,"I purchased this book for my wife and her childhood dreams. As a child she was given this book and it seems to have grown wings and left. She immediately started reading the book on its arrival. Once completed she was led to meet this wonderful person whom is an elementary school teacher. My wife gave her this book so she could read it to her students. This book has, and will, get lots of use. God Loves You, He always has and He always will.The book was used and I expected to see frayed corners on the bindings. It arrived in near new condition, Great service."
1,Perfect if you don't want to spend time with your kids,"I'm horrified that so many have rated this book with more than one star. It teaches children that their needs are not important, their parents are justifiably too busy for them, and when they appeal for attention from their parents they are just being selfish. I'm sure this will asuage the guilt of many a parent, but I feel sorry for those darling children that just want to play a game or have pancakes with their parents. Hopefully, they have loving nannies."
1,A disturbing book,"I bought this book thinking it would give my mischievous 5yr old a good way to think about right and wrong. Instead, it encouraged her to do more devious acts (the girl in the story puts pencils up her mother's nose, having her parents clean the chimney with their tongues and makes her father shave all of his hair off. I can only wonder what went wrong in this author's childhood to give him such a bizzare mind.The illustrations are attrocious.I did not find any redeeming value in this book. I hope I can sell it at my next yard sale.My 12 year old daughter read it and thought that ""the little girl in this book is a schizophrenic whacko in great need of a certified therapist""."
5,A great one when you want a book you won't want to put down,"I just finished 'The Snow Queen' last night and have spent much of this evening rereading sections I particularly liked. I only do that with books I really enjoy. The characters were well-developed and had personalities that could be identified with, the pace sped up at the right rate and the setting and story felt realistic. There was some philosophising and moral messages, but it didn't go over the top like some sci-fi does. And although the scene is set for a sequel, I didn't feel like I was left hanging like in many sci-fi series books. This one was complete with the key questions answered. A great read when you want a book you can get lost in and you have the time not to put it down."
4,Great book with vivid imagination,"I've read this book back when I was a 9th grader in high school, and I like it very much. (I review it 3 years later because I don't have a computer back then.) For some reason, the story is just so vivid that I can't seem to forget the image that was built in my head as I read through the book. And of course, at some point I just can't put the book down... (I am an artist; and yes, the reason I picked up this book 3 years ago because it had the cover illustration by Michael Whelan.) Therefore, for those SciFi fan who love the unusual and totally-out-of-this-world story should read this book. :) PS: a few things I REALLY REALLY don't like about this book is that it contain some offensive language. (Yup, one of the popular words that start with the letter ""F"" and ""S"" are those I REALLY HATE) PSS: I also enjoyed ""The Summer Queen"" (sequel). But due to its length (almost 1000pgs), so I never finish it (didn't have the time in my Junior year)."
2,Not as good as one would expect,"I'm afraid I'm one of those readers who read the reviews for this book and bought it based upon them.I did not enjoy this book because of it's writting style. It is very foggy and slow moving. When I read Sci Fi, I want my details more clear and straight, not wondering what was going on."
5,The start of an epic cycle,"I have to admit, it took a couple of tries before I could get into this book the first time, and when I did, I was glad I'd persisted.This book shows the amazing journeys of several people from or living on Tiamat, a planet that is only open to interstellar travel for 150 year periods before being cut off. The young and determined blossom, the tainted grow more corrupt, and a love spanning the stars takes root. Clashing cultures and a race against Change add a profound element to the story. What could be just another tale about the price of immortality, becomes so much more, thanks to Joan Vinge's wonderful writing."
5,Fabulous,"As a voracious reader of s&sf, particularly enjoying fun and extremely well-written, stories with reference to mythology, wonderful female characters, and alternative social structures, this book has been on my top 5 list since I read it (mumble...) YEARS ago. I haven't loved Vinge's other books like this, but this is on par with Le Guin, one or two of MZB, and some of the best of Andre Norten and James Triptree Jr."
3,"Works fine for legs, not so much for under arms...","I purchased this shave gel last month. The can I have looks like a slightly newer design, but it seems to still be the same product. Anyway, I used it on my legs and felt it did a good job making them smooth/moisturized. However, when I tried to shave my under arms with it, it caused the problems. I noticed that after shaving, it made my under arms' annoying dark discoloration WAY more noticeable than with my previous shaving lotions/gel/bar. I'm not sure if that was due to it not getting a close enough cut (for the record I was using a new razor, so it wasn't dull), and the hair is causing a shadow, or if something in it is reacting badly with my skin (it doesn't hurt or itch, though), and earlier I tried it again, and this time I have weird bumps (not itchy, though) on the skin surrounding my underarm (where the shave gel had touched)So all in all, I'd say this is an OK product for your legs, but wouldn't recommend it for your under arms."
2,"Nice gel, ridiculous pump...","I found this shaving gel to offer a very lush lather, a good smell and overall good value for the money.However, the pressure under which said gel is contained is excessive. Please be careful to press *very, VERY* lightly on the dispenser button when dispensing gel.Indeed, on first use I instinctively applied the same pressure on the nozzle as I've been doing with Gillette gels, Barbasol gels, etc. To my great surprise, the gel not only landed in my hand, but *ricocheted* off the hand and all over my face! Some of it even landed on the ceiling!?!!If this pressurization was done on purpose, perhaps to shorten the lifespan of the product (planned obsolescence), I would find it quite shameful on the part of Johnson & Johnson.Final note: acting on the hunch mentioned in above paragraph, I called the 1-800 number on the bottle explaining the situation and asked for a refund; they promptly sent me a check, no questions asked."
4,"""Cut"" makes the cut........","I bought the book ""Cut"", not really sure what I was expecting, but looking forward to reading it. I was pleasantly surprised at what I received. There are many, many pages of interesting information and pictures about ""stars"" and ""celebrities"" whom I had long forgotten about or had never known existed, and this made it all the more interesting. As well, there was lots of information about well known celebrities and the ""how"", ""where"", ""when"", and sometimes ""why"" of the event. This book helped me so much in gaining an understanding of the personalities and situations which occurred at the time of the person's demise by writing in an easy, understandable vernacular. This is a book I will refer to time and again, and I highly recommend it. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and hardback, very well done, and very reasonable economically. Enjoy!!! Doodlereader19"
4,Morbid Reference Book at Bargain Price,"I found this heavy, handsome volume on the bargain table at the bookstore and decided it would make an interesting reference book for my Hollywood/Movie-themed library. Obviously trying to cash in as a high-brow version of the popular ""Hollywood Babylon"" sensation, this is an admirable collection of abridged biographies of many Tinseltown notables and their (often untimely and/or tragic) demises.There is even a handy guide to gravesites for tourists compelled to visit the final resting places of the scores of celebrities covered in the book.My only gripe is that better editing should have been employed, particularly in the photo captions. There are some major mistakes that will be obvious to even the less-than-diehard movie buffs, which makes me suspect that there may be even more glaring errors in stories presented as fact.Maybe that's why/how it ended up on the bargain table. It might be interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it as perfectly accurate."
3,Informative but not the best,This is a huge book with lots of information. Unfortunately if you are looking at more details into the stars' death then this is sort of a dissapointment. It focuses more on the life story of each star instead of their death. But don't get me wrong it is a good book. If you want more morbid details of their deaths etc then Hollywood Babylon is a better choice.
4,a true story,"This was an important story. It was hard to read because of the horific nature of the abuse. I love to read testimonies about how the Lord changes peoples lives and how even if the circumstances of our lives seem unbearable, He never fails to holds us tight."
5,One of Gerhardt's Best,"This is one of the best albums from the classic film scores series conducted by Charles Gerhardt with the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Max Steiner composed most of the scores represented here. Max Steiner was one of the greats. My favorite cut is the ""main title"" from A STOLEN LIFE. This tune was uesd again in A SUMMER PLACE with Troy Donahue. Both films have their central settings in New England. This tune greatly captures the feeling of the land and sea and the people living on the New England coast. This is a lush and beatiful cd."
5,Priceless for all old movie fans,"I have had this album for years and was thrilled to find it is out in CD. This is a must have for anyone who loves old movies, especially movies of the '30's and '40's. The music is beautiful and fully orchestrated by the National Philharmonic. Each selection elicits all of the atmosphere and attendant feelings of the film for which it was written."
2,Fooled,It Barely Removes The Hair Plus It Comes In A Small Round Tube . It Isnt Worth The Money Yall
4,The Second Wife,"I do not know who chooses the titles for her books as they are published in America, but I do think that the British titles are more evocative of what the story is about. This was not a comfortable story, but an extremely realistic one. It portrays women in a realistic way as our pragmatic, adaptable and callous selves and I felt it was well worth the read. I started reading Buchan's work after viewing ""The Good Wife"" on Masterpiece Theatre. I was entranced with the grays and the caculating personalities, had to discover, much to my satisfaction, the original work it came from. Give this book your time."
3,Sequel doesn't match original,"A so/so sequel to ""Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman,"" which was a much better book. Easy and fast read, but lacking the depth of emotion in the first book. This one is narrated from Minty's perspective, aka ""the other woman."" Unfortunately, Minty was the most one-dimensional character in ""Revenge,"" and this book did little to add meat to her bones. Likewise, the other characters seemed more like caricatures rather than an extension of their personalities from the first book. Not a horrible read, but my advice is to skip it in favor of her other, better books."
1,I didn't finish it,Let me just start by saying that I thought the first book was brilliant. I really loved it. I just couldn't get into this book though. The main character was too whiny and depressing right from the start. She irritated me so much that I stopped reading!
2,Disappointing sequel,"I loved Rose in ""Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman"" and was looking forward to reading more about her. However, Rose doesn't put in an appearance until almost halfway through this book. It's all about Minty, the second wife. I found this book disappointing and light on the plot that the first book had."
3,A tame sequel,"I like Elizabeth Buchan's incisive yet gently writing style and her sharp characterizations, but I had a few problems with this novel. First, Minty seems too different from her character in Revenge of the Middle Aged Woman. Second, there was little plot in this book, so the narratve had to be very character-driven, but without strong characters, it went almost nowhere. The wives in question did not behave badly at all, under the circumstances of the one ""big event"" of the plot. But then again, there was not much revenge in the first book so maybe this author's book's titles are wildly exaggerated to hint at things more exciting than they really are. She does have a really nice eye for detail, and for the ups and downs of modern life, marriage, and childrearing. but can a person like MInty, who was so shallow in the first book, truly become so transformed in six years?"
3,No emotion,"I shouldn't have expected much as I didn't fall in love with Buchan's previous ""Revenge"" book. But I was still disappointed with this novel. Minty was impossible to empathize with, and most of the other characters generated a similar feeling of apathy, if not downright antipathy.A drawn-out tale of just rewards."
4,A good read.,I enjoyed this book. It is not a Desperate Housewives sort of book. It gives you much more to think about. When a husband cheats and leaves his wife there are many complications that go on forever. Enjoy.
3,dont be fooled,these back to back series always get me. the sound is never great. they are of artists who only had enough hits to fit on one cd for the two artists but when you listen closely if you remember the songs they are usually complete later remakes by the artists. at least the michael johnson part is. very very disappointing. i love his original take on ALMOST LIKE BEING IN LOVE. now the stephen bishop songs do sound like the originals so i'm glad to have this for SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY and ON AND ON so i guess it was worth the very cheap price just for those.
3,AND THE WINNER IS....,"This K-Tel combo of 80's troubadors Johnson and Bishop offers five of the artists biggest hits. Unfortunately, Johnson's are pulled from an ""unplugged"" album and are not the radio versions. While performed well, they aren't the popular versions listeners are expecting. Good songs but K-Tel should've given us the original renditions.Bishop's tracks, however, are the familiar versions and spotlight his distinctive voice and creative songwriting. Only IT MIGHT BE YOU from ""Tootsie"" is not a Bishop composition, but Marilyn and Alan Bergman's song is one of Bishop's finest recordings. Another outstanding offering is SEPARATE LIVES, a song from ""White Nights"" and a smash hit for Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin. ON AND ON shows us Bishop's humorous side, an infectious tropical cocktail. SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY and EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE are exuberant up-beat pop ditties.Overall, Bishop comes out the winner over a disappointing Johnson representation."
4,"Good, with some limitations","I really like that the holder has a hinged cover to keep the dust off. I also like that it revolves, making it easy to see all my earrings. The unit seems to be well made.However, if you have lots of post/stud and wire/drop earrings, you may want to store them in separate holders. When I tried to store both types in one, things got awkward.You can't store anything, except post/studs, with the unit on its side (my preference, looks more organized). Otherwise, anything longer than 1/2"" gets hung-up when you try turning the revolve knob.I stood the holder vertically (knob at top). It's okay, but earrings are cluttered and you can't see some if most spaces are filled.Trying for more ""organization"" I re-spaced the earrings further apart, but that cut down on number I could store."
4,Satisfied with this product,"I like the earring stand, but it is really best for stud earrings, and small ones at that. The holes are very close together so anything larger than a stud has to be spaced every other hole, and larger earrings even farther than that. But I like the quality and the looks of it. I would recommend it."
5,Earring holder,This is an excellent solution to storing and finding earrings. Its transparency allows you to quickly find the pair or color you seek. It stores easily on a dresser or in a cabinet. I like this the best of all earring holders I looked at. And the price was reasonable.
4,Functional and just the right size,"As others have said, great for short earrings 1"" and under, not so much for chandelier types. Works fine standing on its end, makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Some styles that have the rigid clasps don't fit or drape well, but as long as you only have a few of those, it works just fine. I'd recommend it."
2,Not very good.,This is not what you would expect from a sabbath tribute. It's more industral or techo tahn what sabbath would play. This would only be for a ture Sabbath fan and even then it would not come close to Navity in Black. But if you're look for a Sabbath cd with a tist this for you.
3,to much industrial,"This is not an album for the average Sabbath fan. It is much more industrial and death metalish than most. Although Cathedrals Wheels of Confusion is a good cover. A really heavy version but still maintains integrity. Anal C**ts version of ""killing yourself to live"" might be one of the only songs i have ever listend to and not undrestood despite knowing all the lyrics."
4,to much death/grindcore for me!,"but cathedral two cover song are heavy and one or two other tracks are great brutal truths cover is real heavy but the vox kils the cover,dead sadly."
3,a case of poor production and a matter of taste,cathedral has 2 excellent cover but the production of the whole cd has a very bad sound.many of the other cover fall to the bands bad choice of dieluting the orginal song structure and useing massive technology to spruce up their lame attempts.knowing this is earache and they put out deathmetal/gringcore and doom I can't complain about the vocals brual truth and sleep due great covers here but the rest the vox are seriously bad
3,"Takes some getting used to, but...","This is actually a fairly decent album if you can give it a chance. Cathedral puts in a powerhouse preformance on two tracks, ""Wheels of Confusion"" and ""Solitude"". Other tracks that impressed me were ""Snowblind"" by Sleep and ""Zero the Hero"" by Godflesh. There is also a very interesting techno version of ""Paranoid"" by Ultraviolence. Not sure if I like it or not. The downside is that there is some pretty heavy death metal on this one that may take some getting used to. Overall I still think this album was worth my money."
3,5 FOR CATHEDRAL!!!!!,"I dont think I paid more than 7$ for this back in the day!The CATHEDRAL song's are AWESOME!! why these were not added to make a re-relase of FOREST is beyond me!! the Brutal Truth one is good,Confessor is good, sleep is ok, godlfesh is ok, rest can be SKIPPED!!CADAVER are suppossed to be on here with ''sweet leaf'' but for some reason they arent on it?BUY THIS IF YOUR OBSESSED WITH EARLY CATHEDRAL LIKE ME!!"
1,Ms. Cornwell's children's book is a dissappointing,"While she gives it a good college try, I was very disappointed in this book. I had trouble reading it to myself and can not imagine reading it out loud to a group (which I do often as a librarian). The words did not flow smoothly as they really need to in a children's book. I was also disinterested in the story completely."
5,Full of Charm,"Life`s Little Fables is a charming ,engaging book .written for children but I love it and the pictures I think are little works of art.I enjoy it over and over again. it is happy and colourful and uplifting.Joan Blacklock/uk"
5,very nice,the quality is superior. very easy to open the tools you want. sharp and durable. It's more expensive than the one I had before. but this one has more functions and looks very cool. nice company with your hiking and trip.
5,Useful and sized right,This knife has been a useful addition to my daily hip pack. Holding up well over time and is a small enough footprint size to carry comfortably.
5,"A good value, with good features","I did extensive research on digital cameras before choosing this one. It has optical (as well as digital) zoom, a USB connection (essential since I use the Macintosh), a LCD preview that you don't have to use (which saves batteries), and a relatively small size. Given the price, it was definitely the way to go.Took the camera to Europe, and came back and viewed the pictures on-screen, as well as had them printed by Ofoto (""trusted partner""). The results are at about the same as with the film camera I brought. Since it was much smaller than the film camera, we used this one almost exclusively. My only real complaint is that there's no audible indication of when you're switching from optical zoon (better quality) to digital zoom (less quality). Given the price range and picture quality, I think this is the best camera to buy."
4,Fiji film finepix 1400 digital camera,"good camera. Hard to handle though. Good clarity of pictures. Could stand different zoom buttons. Good size, good usb and good software. Nice LCD to veiw pictures. ALso very handy to have a veiw finder especially in the sun. Long battery life compared to others. Don't use the LCD if you don't have to. Gussles battery life."
4,Fujifilm Finepix 1400Zoom ~ A GREAT CAMERA!,"Yes, it takes wonderful pics, blah, blah, blah. What I REALLY like about it is how easy it is to upload onto the computer. Also, I was a little hesitant about using the smart media chips, but have found them to be reliable and easy to use. I highly recommend it! The only drawback is that it sucks power when viewing LCD screen."
4,Amazing camera at a great price!!,"I just purchased this camera about 2 days ago and I am very pleased with it!! The picture quality is the best and it is very easy to use! Actually, I took it out of the box and started taking pictures right away! I did a lot of research before I bought a digital camera and I found out that this one had the features I was looking for (such as zoom, USB upload, high resolution) for a reasonable price! I also found out that if the camera is set to the lower resolution(which has about the same picture quality as the higher resloution) you can get about twice as many photos on the included 4MB smart media card. The only negatives I found in this camera is the LCD monitor is difficult to see, if taking pictures with it, in low light. Also the software was a bit challenging to upload on my PC. Still this is an awesome camera! Buy it you will definetly be surprised & pleased!!"
2,Fuji Finepix 1400 no good with Windows ME millenium Edition,"After researching many digital cameras, I decided that the Fuji Finepix 1400 was the best deal. The camera works fine, but I could not take advantage of the USB connection since the drivers included for Win 98 and Win 2000 are not supported by Win ME. The Fuji website was not helpful either and I ended up having to buy a Smartmedia card reader in order to really evaluate the performance of the camera."
4,Great Digtal Camera,I am a new user to digital cameras and received this one with my new computer. I thought it would probably be cheap. Well to my surprise it's not. It is very easy to use...
4,Easy digital fun,"Good camera for the entry level novice type new to all this wacky digital stuff. I was able to get all started and whatnot prettty quick, it wasn't too technical. I have a mac and the software was painless to install and use. I'd recommend buying the rechargeable batteries (get 8- 4 to keep in the camera and the other 4 to throw in when the ones in die). They arent kidding when people say these cameras suck batteries dry fast! Good stuffs, this thing."
4,Great camera but ...,We purchased the camera in November and have taken 2000+ photos. My experience is similar to the other reviews - produces very good pictures at an excellent value. My only disappointment has been the lense cover which now fails to stay in the open position unless you hold it open. If you let go of the cover it moves towards the lense causing it to retract and shut the camera off. Before purchasing the camera I had read a similar complaint on a different site. I suspect that this is a weakness in the design. The camera still works fine with this annoyance. I'll probably continue to use the camera as is rather than deal with the hassle of getting it fixed.
4,Great little camera,"I got this camera, for christmas and found my self taking pictures of everything i could find. I would have this camera a five except that it sucks batteries so get rechangeable ones. Other problems is it only comes with a 4mb memory card, so if you want to take more pictures i'd suggest getting a bigger mermory card. Now for the good points, it's really easy to work, the pictures turn out great. The Usb port works wonders because you can get your pictures in a matter of secords. Unlike a parrallel which is really slow. It has great zooming features. There isn't very many things that don't explain themselves. Overall I think it a great camera."
5,Great Product!,"Within less than half an hour of receiving the FinePix 1400 (as a present), I was taking great-looking pictures.While much of the basics of using this camera are intuitive, I do strongly recommend reading the manual (and maybe picking up a book, such as ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Digital Photography"") for the somewhat more advanced topics.I do love it -- easy to use, produces great pictures, well-built."
3,Good Entry Level Camera!,"I recently purchased the FinePix 1400z and overall have been pleased. It is very simple to operate and has a very clean design. There is only one drawback to this camera. The LCD screen is useless when used outdoors. The LCD screen is so dim that it is impossible to view what you have taken a picture of. It is a great indoor camera, but out-of-doors you must use the viewfinder and hope for the best."
4,Good reliable camera,"I've had this camera for over 2 years now and haven't had the need to upgrade it. It takes clear pictures and the 3x optical zoom comes in handy. Memory is a steal nowadays. With a 64mb card, I can take ~150 fine pictures. I print photos at around 4"" X 6"" and they turn out fine. Perhaps I'll upgrade to a camera with a movie mode and tv out capability, but for a beginner that just wants a simple point-and-shoot or someone new to digital photography, I'd recommend the Finepix 1400."
5,Great shoes!,"These are great shoes, especially for chubby feet. I have problems getting my daughter's feet into other shoes, but these work great. They're very cute and she seems to be very comfortable in them."
2,Food for thought.....,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this book. I had hoped to have purchased a factual, and unbiased piece of non-fiction. And I soon found out that this book fulfils none of the above. After about 90 pages I got the opinion that the author was trying to persuade me to think that every Muslim was a gun-trotting fanatic ready to blow himself to pieces. His ""free"" interpretations of some parts of the Koran or his explanation of what a jihad is are ""interesting"" to say the least. Also the author's attempts to create hypothetical cases of future terrorist threats are amusing at most. There are definitely better books on Islamic Fundamentalism, but there are also worse."
1,OVERSIMPLIFICATION,"In the wake of the 11 September tragedies in New York and Washington, it is no surprise that Americans would want to know more about Islamic terrorism.But it would be wrong to oversimplify a complex issue. This book is such an oversimplification. It draws heavily on two previous books: one is Anthony J. Dennis's "" The Rise of the Islamic Empire and the threat to the West"" which came out six years ago and the other is Amir Taheri's "" Holy Terror: Inside the World of Islamic Terrorrism"" which appeared 12 years ago.Both those books offer a far deeper, and fairer, analysis of the phenomenon. They are also free of the obvious hatred that Norval has for all Arabs and Muslims. A READER IN ENGLAND"
2,another uninteresting reissue.,"With all these Japanese reissues of Sparks' 80s output, they just haven't made them worth an inflated price tag with these bonus tracks if you've already got the original CDs. Here you get a minute long radio promotional commercial for this album, plus 3 unreleased demos: Kidnap, A trying Day, and Dancing Dangerous. Okay tracks, but not any kind of must haves--a Trying Day comes closest to being worth it if there had been a full studio recording done."
3,Tv,"Tv works ok, but pic shows black, which is what I wanted, but white was sent. Make sure you get the right color before its shipped."
2,Not for hoops,"Probably seemed like a good idea to someone, but it totally does not work if you have hoop earrings....which I do and quite a few pairs at that, ranging in size from small to 3.5"" in diameter. Look again, there is no way these will fit in this design. My long dangly earrings don't fare too well either as the rows are too close together so long earrings overlap onto those below; also if you have spring ear wire types (french wires?) they are almost impossible to put onto this. Bottom line: too limited to bother with at least for my big earring collection"
3,Not bad..,"This is a neat holder except that you can't put smaller hoops on it because they won't ""wrap"" around the plastic."
5,Truly a Remarkable Upgrade,"Wow... took a long time to get one but when I did, what a difference!!I was running a TNT2 card on a P3 800 system with DVD hardware decoding and I thought I had it all.Once I put in the Prophet II, however, the improvement was amazing. It runs most games in the highest resolution possible without a hiccup, the software DVD decoding works far better than the Real Magic Hollywood + I had in it, and the 2D graphics are crisper and cleaner than I've ever seen.Good luck getting the card, as it's always out of stock everywhere. But when you do, it'll be the best computer purchase you could make!"
5,Awesome,"I was so glad to see one of my favorite shows on DVD and so cheap, it arrived at my house in real good time."
2,Easy to see why so many people hate this film,People either love this film or hate it. I am in the group of people that hate it. I am a Louis Koo fan and I have loved many of Johnnie To's films but this movie is completely moronic. People just go around challenging others to judo matches in the streets and they flip each other over and over again. This movie would probably be very offensive to people that compete in judo because of how cheesy and stupid it is.Louis Koo hardly says anything in this movie and it is probably the first time I have not liked him in a film.You are taking a chance by getting this film. You will either love it or hate. That's the risk you take.
3,Could have been so much better,"This book gives a good overview of how the state of Washington was formed and what you can expect to see in general areas. If, however, you are expecting to be told exactly where to go to see specific formations you're in for a disapointment. Instead of ""As you travel 6.4 miles north of the intersection of highway xyz look at the road cut on the west side of the highway and here's what you'll see..."" we get a lot of ""Here's a picture of what you might find near, just north of, around, a few miles from, inbetween this town and that town... etc.""The best you can get from this book is the ability to cruise around a given area and hope you stumble on to something that resembles the formations pictured in the book. Guys, guys, we all have maps of Washington, tell us where to stop!"
5,Want peace?,How great it is to be reminded how much you are the sheep being protected by the shepherd. This book fully explained an already popular and comforting verse in the Bible and took it to a level that allowed it to serve as a rock for me during tough times. I give this to others who need reminders that they are not lost sheep but rather protected and Safe in the Shepherd's Arms.
5,Safe in the Shepherd's Arms,This is a wonderful little book for both men and women. It explains the 23 Psalm in a way that will touch your heart.
1,"Bad, bad bad!","I bought this mystery collection because Rex Stout is one of the authors included, but none of the other writers are worthy to carry his empty beer-cap. The recipes might be worthwhile, but that's the only reason I gave this dud even one star. Too bulky to use for propping up wobbly tables - I can't imagine any household wanting to have this waste of paper on its shelves."
2,Obtuse and ungenerous,"This is a surprisingly mean-spirited and disingenuous book. Ms. Morton runs a sexy personal ad (""English female, 30s, slim and attractive, seeks professional male for fun times"") and then is shocked, shocked to find herself in the company of men looking for sex. Some of the respondents are in fact entertainingly weird. However, I was more often struck by Morton's vicious rejection of even the most pedestrian quirks. She seems to have no real interest in or understanding of the human drama around her. These guys may be creeps, but many of them deserve a better date than Ms. Morton."
4,"Educational, interesting, and depressing","Ms. Morton shows us the dirty underbelly of the world of personals dating. It's ugly. The only problem I have with the book is that she goes on these dates without any effort or contemplation of being romantically involved with these men from the beginning. Most of these men were totally undeserving of a second date (are there men out there like this?) but it doesn't seem fair for those men who may have actually been looking for an honest relationship. So as ugly as Ms. Morton shows America how bad the dating scene is, she also comes from a pre-not interested stand point."
1,1000 American portraits of one woman,"No, I am not in this book and I am very sorry to waste my time to read it. Cynical, annoying and unfair. I have much better suggestion for all that man in the book. Why not to write a little review about date with Ms. Morton and publish another book with the title something like ""1000 American portraits of one woman"". Well, every game has it own rules and the main rule of ""seek for fun times"" game is PRIVACY, which does not exist in Ms. Morton code of rules. So tell me, how can you judge people if you have big ethical issue in the first place? Entertaining? I don't think so! Sorry Ms. Morton - cannot score that way."
5,In the grip of the nyika,"Great book.. Hard to put down, good adventure story of a time sadly passed. I should have been born 100 years ago"
1,Marginally helpful,"Thomas reviews all the tenses and modes using various common expressions very consistently. His technique is translation: ""How would you say....,"" which really teaches very little."
5,Paul H. Lang,"This book is what one comes to expect from Henri Nouwen: simple, winsome, deep, and compassionate. I serve as a pastor and find his comments still contemporary, though they are the product of Nouwen's contemplation of twenty years ago.Nouwen borrows not only the content, but the habit of desert wisdom in providing commentary that is brief and compelling. His invitation to follow in the practice of Abba Arsenius by embracing three movements (to flee, to keep silence, and to pray) is simply organized and powerfully presented.Nouwen's description of the 'compulsive minister' is accurate in every detail and served to draw me into the lessons as if this book were written for me in particular.""The Way of the Heart"" is directed at those who are engaged in the practice of ministry - but it's lessons are easily applied to life outside the practice of ministry. I heartily recommend it to one and all."
3,good - not too deep - quick read,"I enjoyed the perspective of being oversturated with words in our society. We are bombarded by advertising and have become numb to the spoken word. The highlight of the book is "" Through spending time in the silent presence of the Lord that gives strenghth to our words"""
5,Interesting Book,"The Way of the Heart is Henri Nouwen's classic work on the Desert Fathers. The late Nouwen was an influential Catholic priest who left his post to care for a bed-ridden man who would never speak, eat, or walk.In this book, Nouwen draws upon the wisdom of early monastic Christians. From their writings and lives, he illuminates three essential pillars of their faith--solitude, silence, and prayer.This is a short work, less than one hundred pages, but what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up for in quality. Nouwen is able to interweave our modern world with that of the Desert Fathers, making their isolated ways seem possible in our busy world.This is a great book to take for a weekend camping trip or a just a quiet day at home. It's a good book for reflection and takes some time to soak in."
1,Brenthaven buckles break,"Front plastic buckle broke after normal usage. The keyring buckle also broke much earlier. The lifetime warranty does not cover shipping and handling in either direction. I can understand having to pay to ship the product to Brenthaven but they should have the decency to fix it and send it back. Instead they want you to pay $15 for the return trip. That might be ok if they made a quality product that lasts. Instead, the bag will be thrown in the trash where it belongs. For free."
4,Weather Forecaster,This has worked well for us - although it forecasts rain whenever it is cloudy (we live in Las Vegas - very little rain) the temperatures inside and out are very accurate.
3,"Works OK, base unit very large, does not display more than one remote senor at one time.","BAR888RA Wireless Weather w/ 2Got this thermometer for Christmas. It appears be accurate and it works OK.The base unit is very large. The display looks like a credit card in an 8x10 picture frame. Also the base unit only displays one remote sensor at a time.Have one remote sensor in the garage and another in my greenhouse. The sensor in the garage stays associated with the base, but I have to reset the base unit when I want to see the temp. in the greenhouse. The greenhouse is about 75 ft form the base unit.I would look for a little more refined product if I had not got this for Christmas."
1,poorly built product,"i only had product for 10 days and it stopped working correctly, i opened up the unit to discover a circuit board had been hod poged on to the main board and it soldered connections had broken, i would not advise the purchase of this item, it is poory put to gether on the inside"
2,"Not Accurate, Won't Last",I have had the unit for a few years and would not reccomend it. I purchased it primarily for the remote temprature capability. I have a pumphouse that I wanted to monitor the temerature in as well as outside temp. The temperature from the remotes worked pretty good when new but now doesn't at all and the weather forcasting capability has gone down the tubes as well. It will show sun on a rainy day and rain on a sunny day. The atomic clock is nice though and that still works.
3,Instruction on DVD is OK,"Some of the drills are useful, but many are useless. Overall, DVD is OK, but his other titles are much better."
5,Iron monkeys are the best kind of monkeys,"I cannot understand what anyone who has any interest whatsoever in Eyehategod and other bands of their ilk would be unable to appreciate Iron Monkey. This album is fantastic, if not a bit short... but then its an EP so I guess I don't have much to complain about in that area either. Simply amazing. What else is there to say?"
3,Eyehategod with a stupid name,"Yup. That covers it. Pretty decent sludge/swamp riffs, screamy vocals... you'd swear it was eyehategod with a dumb name."
3,average crust with amazing vocals,"While i find the merciless japan metal screams to be amazing , the music here is what lacks.The viscous chords are derivative of all the horribly mangled doom metal bands like Grief , Sleep and Toadliquor. While there may be catchiness , their music lacks the said bands level of emotional intensity and originality. All in all , a decent recording , with some bizarre shrill vocals....."
2,Hmmm ...,"These guys are somewhat okay, nothing I haven't heard before though. The vocals are decent. I think I will stick to Eyehategod."
2,a lie,"there is a spell contained in theis book (the spell of making) which reads... ...ANAIL NATHROCK UTHVASS BETHUDD DOCHIEL DIENVIEthe truth to the spell is that it translates to the gaelic version of mary had a little lamb. otherwise, a good learning tool."
5,A thoroughly wonderful book,"This is just a marvelous book... A very enjoyable read and also very fascinating if you are interested in the Arthurian legends. It is not, as some people suggest, fabrication, but very real. The story chapters are very engrossing and the rituals are very deep and meaningful. One of my favorites."
5,great fiction,"I suppose this book could be rated high or low depending on what angle you're coming from. As I'm not a Pagan/Druid or even spiritual, I read this book several years ago for its value as fiction alone, and was not disappointed.Monrose is a talented writer and no one I think would argue that this is not a wonderful story.As for the historical or spiritual value of the book, I cannot comment, but for those of us who enjoy fantasy or fiction with a Celtic theme I certainly recommend it."
2,I have purchased the book and found it very entertaining.,"Like most people I found it very entertaining but do belive this book is not very pratical in ""teaching"" the reader anything except maybe the herbology part. As an herboligist some of what is illistrated for the leaches are acurate but then anyone into the CRAFT can find the knowledge from any field of magic. A good read if you like the legend of Arthur."
2,mixed bag,"I found that there are infact many inaccuracies in this book--as other reviews have pointed out. But if one keeps this in mind and reads it with one hand on a factual account of history (little hard anyway as Druids did not keep actual written records) then the lessons can be insightful and helpful. I like the style of the book, using teaching stories to get points across but I had to remember about the inaccuracies as well. So, read and judge for yourself. But keep looking as well as this is certainly not the only book on Druidry."
1,"Misogynistic, racist, and incompetent","As a writer, Monroe would make a good dish washer or garbage collector. Scanning the book, I cannot find any redeeming quality. The writing is poor; the magick is constrained, poorly thought out, and uninspiring. The ""scholarship"" is lacking: since when have potatoes and pumpkins ever ""dotted the English countryside"" in Arthurian times?! Potatoes and pumpkins (and corn) are NEW WORLD crops. The rampant racism could be excused if it were presented as only the author's opinion, but it is NOT excusable when it is presented as historical and scholarly."
1,A Detrimental Book at the very least....,"All right, this is one of the books I read when I first became interested pagan spirituality. I was instantly put off by the sexist overtones in the book. As I read further many of the statements were completely different from information I had obtained from other souces. From the start Monroe made it clear that his book wasn't for women and its great to have sprituality books just for men, lord knows there are enough for women LOL, but it doesn't say anywhere on the cover or backflap that the book is geared torward men. Also, Monroe claims that druidry in is entirely a religion for men, that is just not true and I have yet to find another book that makes this same claim.Its a waste of time, but thats just my opinion."
1,Utter crap,"Do not waste your money on this book. Factually incorrect, misogynist and dangerous as well. Any book that supports ingesting mistletoe is flat-out dangerous. I absolutely shudder when I see anyone recommend this tripe without a caveat! Please educate yourselves."
1,The 21 Lessons of Merlyn,"This book is a complete fraud. Those that recommed this book for those interested in Druidism need to seriously re-read it. There is no truth in this book and it was written with the sole purpose of furthering the author's political agenda and making him a quick buck in this fast growing genre. I would agree with Mr. Bonewits that there are much better works out there; John and Caitlin Matthews, Rees, Carr-Gomm and Ellis are much better to inform the new explorer of Druidism. The story itself is acceptable as FICTION. That is all. Coinneach MacFaoilte (Kenneth White) Chief of the Independant Order Of American Druids"
1,pure fantasy,"if you want an amusing read then waste your money on this book. if you are looking for some kind of historical representation of druidic practice then move on. the book that these teachings supposedly come from (the pheryllt, probably spelling it wrong, never could get welsh right) is a complete fabrication. it never existed. try studying historical and folk tale accounts of the celts and join up with one of the reputable celtic reconstructionalist groups (imbas and adf). STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! if amazon had a rating less than one star i would've chosen that instead."
2,Historical interpretation of the 21 lessons,"Well, this book is a great read if you like to read for story value, but I think that the book lacks much in the way of factual information. No one can tell a person how to practice a religion, but if you are interested in ""real"" druidism, look somewhere else, please."
2,Fluff and good story telling,"The authors view of women is also very disturbing. Yes, women were druids AND female druids could achieve just as much as male druids. The author puts female Celts in a negative view.I neglected to give this book 1 star because the author tells a very creative fictional story of Merlyn . Monroe managed to keep this book interesting throughout. He just needs to find more reliable resources. I hear his second book ""The Lost Books of Merlyn"" makes up for this one by being more historically accurate, and the biased which turned me off and there are better books on Druidism. I will not recommend this book because it is sexist content and inaccurate views of druidism and how it degrades women in celtic paganism. nice story but not worth time buying it."
1,Not worth the paper,"I sell books for a living. Metaphysical, druid, occult, wiccan books.I won't even carry this one.Complete drivel. Historically innacurate. Theosophically unsound. A blemish on the face of Paganism in general and an outright insult to druids.Merlin and Arthur stop along their journey to eat . . .CORN AND PUMPKINS?Even as a work of fiction it falls short, as it stomps ""suspension of belief"" into the ground!Obviously a simple ploy to make money off naive individuals desperate for druid lore, or very gullible readers who simply don't care about what their practicing so long as they get to ""play druid"". Author has no conscience or ethics in writing this complete piece of crap.Would personally love to introduce the author to authentic old-school druid practices.If you absolutely want to see for yourself, check it out at the library. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK. You'll be angered and disappointed if you do, and you'll be supporting an ignorant unethical author."
2,Good story...but I'm sick of prophets!,"Well, another self made prophet who writes good stories. Just like Raven Grimissi and his ""Sregheria,"" and Jesus and Buddah and everyone else trying to get people to follow their lead. They come up with beautiful stories and rituals, but lack originality! I'm sure these prophets are great people...but puhleeze!"
4,Wisdom within Wisdom,"Despite what others say, the Lessons is an excellent book for anyone who concerns themselves with things other than magick. The stories hold excellent moral and life lessons which we can hold to. Although some of the magick at the end of each chapter may not be true, some of it can be applied to what we do believe. As for the author, perhaps he was simply smoking something at the time he wrote it and wasn't sharing. Other than that, I enjoyed the book greatly and always will. Peace out."
4,A great place to start.,"This book is an intriging one. Many of the lessons it teaches are great and the chants are pretty well done. The author did a nice job in presenting modern day druidism and this is one of the books on druidism that actually kept me awake! Sure, Carr-Gomm's book was resourceful but this book does something to the mind that awakens the druid from within yourself. The lessons it teaches gives you adequate insight into the ""Mysterious"" (ha ha) world of a druid. I recommend this book to anyone interested in druidism because if you try to read another one do blame me if you find yourself falling asleep after the first page. Believe me because I did.The NecromancerP.S. The herbal section can be of help to some though not all because some are to chicken to actually try the remedies for themselves.But the herbal mixtures most if not all will work (I've never gotten a chance to try all,but if you follow the directio! ns with the mistletoe it WILL not kill you)."
1,21 Lessons of Fantasy,"An editor's nightmare. Not only is this book chock full of grammatical and spelling errors, inconsistencies, and historical inaccuracies, it is an altogether flight of fantasy based at least partly on a KNOWN FORGERY, The Book of Pheryllt. This book is best used as a prop for wobbly furniture, or perhaps a projectile at unwelcome guests."
1,Awful,"The main reason this book makes people excited about druidism is because it fills their mind with all the fantasy they'd hoped real druidism had. It's all nonsense.. filled with incantations and rituals from movies and an over active imagination. If any of you DO manage to conjure up Merlin from the incantation spell, I'd be thoroughly amazed."
1,Inaccurate and possibly fatal.,"While I do not claim great scholarship, I do feel that thisbook is largely a creation of the author, dealing very little with passed-on knowledge. The author claims thatDruids used pumpkins, which are a New World plant.On another note, the author's misogynism is obvious and repellent. I've checked with those who have studied this area more than I, and they find no evidence that the Druids remained celibate, and have found evidence of females who were Druids.I am most concerned, however, with the herbal information, and various recipes advised in this book. These include, for example, narcissus bulbs and wormwood, both extremely danger to life or mind. Also, a ritual in this book could result in a forest fire.On the whole, I find the book at best doubtful, and at worst dangerous."
1,"Uh, what?","Don't get me wrong. I love Celtic books in general. And I tried to read this one.....The 21 Lessons of Merlyn is confusing, incoherent, and sexist. I can't follow this book from one paragraph to the next, since it doesn't seem to be organized very well. It skips from topic to topic. And, the author seems to look down his nose at women. He suggests that the young boy's ""girls are icky"" attitude is actually the proper attitude for a grown man, and that socialization is to blame for any attraction a man may feel for a woman. He claims that no one can become a powerful magician if he ""depletes his power"" through sex. This book has turned several women of my aqcuaintance away from the Celtic path, and that's sad. If you must read this, make sure you read some other Celtic books first, so you don't come away with the impression that this system is the one and only Celtic way."
2,Fluff and good story telling,"The authors view of women is also very disturbing. Yes, women were druids AND female druids could achieve just as much as male druids. The author puts female Celts in a negative view.I neglected to give this book 1 star because the author tells a very creative fictional story of Merlyn . Monroe managed to keep this book interesting throughout. He just needs to find more reliable resources. I hear his second book ""The Lost Books of Merlyn"" makes up for this one by being more historically accurate, however still biased and there are better book on merlin and arthur. over nice story but not worth time buying it.I will not recommend this book because it is sexist content and inaccurate views of druidism and how it degrades women in celtic paganism."
3,A book for the experienced Spiritual Seeker.,"This book is not for a person who is just starting to delve into the many layers of the occult. The author uses misinformation at every turn and does not accurately depict either the beliefs or the culture of the Druids.This being said the book can be taken in two ways. One, it is a reasonably well written fictional work with nothing more to offer than a few moments of entertainmOr to the trained eye, that of the Spiritualist Seeker, there is much information on the versatility of various religions and spiritual paths. The book does an excellent job of portraying a non-traditional view or spirituality and how a person might form their own personal spiritual path that includes various teachings from different areas as well as a bit of their own special spiritual spice.This book is a convergence of many different sects of belief. Its only real tragedy is the author's blatant misrepresentation of the Druids."
1,"""But there's gotta be a pony in there somewhere...""","If you know the joke which ends in the above punchline, then you know what I think of this book.Enough said..."
5,21 lessons of Merlin is WONDERFUL !,"The 21 Lessons of Merlin was the first book I had ever bought and that was about 20 years ago! And I must say that it is the only book that stays on my coffee table while my other magical books are in my office, and I have many books! It IS that wonderful!If you don't read it for the magick, then read it for the psychology and look inside yourself for the answers that Merlin presented to Arthur for they are there with in you as well.This is a book well worth your time and I highly recommend it for the beginner and a 3rd !This book will teach you that everything you want, you already have with in you! Just don't be afraid to look and you will find something wonderful :-) Monroe has wrote this book like if someone gave you a nice, juicy watermelon on a hot day, you just can't take one bite !!! His writting style makes you wanna read and read ! Thank you Douglas Monroe :-)"
1,entertaining tripe,"21 Lessons Of Merlin is the biggest hindance to the revival of Celtic Paganism and Druidry out there today. The book is historically inaccurate in almost every detail, and spiritually innacurate in ways that make it a real danger to honest students. Once you've read a half-dozen good books on celtic ways you might want to give this a look. The author *does* manage to craft some interesting rituals, but the basis for them, and the theology behind them, is just horrid.Ian"
1,21 Lessons of Hogwash,"As a modern-day student of Druidry, I cannot recommend this book, it is full of gross inaccuracies; to name two: (1) Monroe states that pumpkins were a ""sacred plant"" of the Druids, however pumpkins are indigenous to North America and were utterly unknown to the ancient Celts; (2) he recommends the ingestion of mistletoe -- mistletoe is a very toxic plant, and should *NOT!* be ingested in any form. I would recommend ""The Apple Branch"" by Alexei Kondratiev, also on this site, and books in its bibliography for those interested."
2,"Good fiction, not historically accurate at all!!!","I felt that as a fiction story it was fabulous. I enjoyed the storyline very much. I gave it two stars because it was a good story, but for historical accuracy I would have given it zero stars.If you're looking for books about actual Druidry look somewhere else. There are many out there that are historically accurate and an interesting read. Try any books by Philip Carr-Gomm, Ellen Evert Hopman, and Caitlin and John Matthews...just to name a few.If you're looking for why this book [is not good] regarding Druidry I suggest going to the OBOD (Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids) website and do a little surfing to the library page...very enlightening."
1,What a disaster,"OK firstly,I have NOT read this book. Only a few reviews posted here.Although I am sure it is entertaining reading for some, some of the specific points that were raised indicate that this is not authentic, not druidic, not even historic.One reviewer said :-------- ""there is a spell contained in theis book (the spell of making) which reads... ...ANAIL NATHROCK UTHVASS BETHUDD DOCHIEL DIENVIEthe truth to the spell is that it translates to the gaelic version of mary had a little lamb. otherwise, a good learning tool. --------Well, that was ALSO the exact line of the movie Excalibur that Merlin was using as the charm of making. Embaressing.Be wary of this one."
1,In A Word....,"Absolute junk. Don't waste your money on this one, historically inaccurate (despite what the guy below says), and magically inept. A well-written work of fiction. A better place to start: The World of the Druids by Miranda Green."
5,Online Book Club Reading,I joined an online book club and they were reading this book.There ia another book in this series that they read too. I bought thisbook. It was fun to read the difference takes on what is said in this book.It's a good book to read.
5,This book is an incredible account of Arthur and Merlyn!,"I have always been interested in Arthur and Merlyn, so when I saw this book I immediately bought it. This is the best book I've ever read. An incredible account of Merlyn and Arthur!"
3,"Very entertaining, well written, questionable scholarship","Mr. Monroe would enjoy far more praise if he could back up his resources convincingly. Sexist content. Not a reliable resource for serious Pagan research. Content may be functional, but unless Mr.Monroe can really prove otherwise, fictional."
3,Just a good read,I have been studing the Druid way for about 10 years and found some thing in the book that were factual. For the most part the book was inconsistant with the Druid way of life. For the price it would still be a good read
1,This book is junk,"Influential junk, profitable junk, but junk. Its claims have no basis in history, archaeology, or any other reputable discipline. Some of its claims, such as the idea that the druids were vegetarians, can be disproven with about an hour's easy work. Monroe clearly didn't do any work other than reading novels and contemplating his wallet. Don't waste your money on this."
5,"An elaborate, and concise work on the indo-european culture.","I have cross referenced the work of Douglass Monroe and have found in my own investigations, his work to not only be concise but remarkably incitefull. I have read and studied this work for 7 years, it is the most information on one subject that one will find between two covers. I don't recomend this book to just anyone. Only those whose interest is true on the subject of theology. If your looking for a, how to cast neat spells and how to belong to something book mysterious, I suggest you go look in the wicca section, it's right up your alley!"
3,Deal with it,"I see so many complaints about this book and it's ""sexist views"". I have spent much of the last 12 years reading and researching Keltic magic, shamanism and Druidry. And in this time I have had contact with several Orders of shaman( please excuse my bad spelling). The one thing I have come across continualy is that the sexes have two different roles in the magical realm and woman is not intended to teach male roles and vise versa men deal more in the casting of more forceful or testosterone drive style of magic and well it should be there is not to be the role of a feminan man men grew to be hunteds and fighters women also fought in battle but is was more of a mans role. Women had a broader dealing with the spiritual then men but not in the harsher forms. They are ment to be our other half the half the deals more with caring and feeling divination and the perhaps more beautiful side of life while men had a firm harder role in the spiritual realm ."
1,21 Steps to Delusion,"This book, I feel, tries to show its great wisdom in being nearly unreadable, and by taking the ""One True Way"" road, can be very intimidating to the reader. I assure you, I know many MANY Druids in both the UK and the USA who have either done quite well NOT reading this book (the book isnt available in the UK without special order), or found it laughable. I do not know any druids, personally, that took this book seriously."
2,Dangerous and irresponsible,"My exposure to Druidry is with this book, and Mr. Monroe's later book ""The Lost books of Merlyn.I just wanted you to know my Druidry information is extremely limited.This book only deals with the Welsh version of Druidry.I disagree with Mr. Monroe's vegetarian stance in this book. Some people absolutely need some meat in their diet to function properly.It is DANGEROUS and IRRESPOSIBLE for the author and publisher to recommend preparations in this book. The American version of Mistletoe is a DEADLY poison.If you have questions or comments, E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda"
1,Inaccurate fantasy,"I have to say that this book is many things, but accurate is not one of them. Relying on sources that are known to be falce sets the tone for the book. I did find the explanations of the fantasies to be quite amusing though. Unless you are wanting a book to keep in the bathroom, I would not recommend this book."
3,Cool Story For What It's Worth!!,"I do not profess to know anything about druidry or its principles, but I did enjoy this book as a good story about young Arthur and Merlyn from a different perspective than other books I've read about Arthurian legend. I don't know if any of it is accurate historically, but I did enjoy the story for what it's worth."
2,Some Later Considerations,"One of the first books I ever read on the subject of Druidism/Druidry, whichever you prefer, I can only thank this book for setting me on the path of learning more. Looking back on this path after many years, I feel that I must steer others away from it. I won't bother rewriting the downfalls of this text, that has been done by many other reviewers. The book has two good points: First, the story portion is an inspired work of fiction. Second, it may help the student to discern fact from fiction. Read this book and the works of DJ Conway, if only to understand what is NOT true."
1,a excellent work.......... of fiction that is,i was frist intrested in this book for i love celtism and would get anything on it i could browsing in a local new age store and i found this it said a study in druid magic and lore i was like wow i expected a book filled with lore magick and some hisory about druids what i found ways a work of ficition that is about as good as lord of the rings
1,An amusing work of fiction.,This book is an amusing work of fiction. Besides being highly inaccurate and full of anachronisms it is offensively sexist in maintaining that only men can achieve the highest grades of perfection. If one reads it as a work of fiction and keeps in mind that it is pure fantasy and bears no relation to any reality that ever existed I suppose that there is little harm in it.
5,A realization of truths.,"It is very hard for modern Druids to decipher between fact and misinformation since most of the old sources have been lost. Though this book may be interpreted in different ways, the truth can always be found. This book gives clear information and methods for self-discovery and performing ancient rituals. The storyline helps in understanding directions, and keeps you interested in the book. The many charts are easy to follow and learn from. As always, the more you learn, the more you grow into a different person, shaped with wisdom and knowledge. This is not just another one of the useless books, and I fully recommend this to anyone who feels ready for an in-depth look of reality."
4,Absolutely intriging,A must for all with a bent for the metaphysical. Insightful and entertaining. Strong Jungian influences.
3,"Enjoyable, but I'm not an expert","I enjoyed this book as light reading. I am not an expert on druidism, so I can not comment on the accuracy of the material."
3,Interesting Story But False Information,"I give this book a five because it had a very intruiging and interesting story line, but extremely false information. All one has to do is read some of the other reviews for some examples of how this book contains false information. I am not an expert in druidism, in fact this was the first book i ever read on it, However through further study i have found that many things about it are indeed false. However i was touched by the story, and feel that it would still be well worth the money to buy"
2,False but inspiring,"This was the second book I read on the Celts and Druidism in particular. In hindsight, I am a bit angry at the lies it fed my eager mind, but also still thankful for the imaginative inspiration it fostered within me. I think that most will agree that the book has a good story (albeit fiction) and overall ""magical"" feel to it, and this is where I think that we should pay the most attention. The format and ""feel"" of the book should be a sort of guide post/model for future authors in this genre. I have been on many mailing lists that attest to the great number of young pagans/druids that this book inspired to further their knowledge. Yes, it can and has done harm, but as a source of inspiration to those looking for an introduction, etc it has done its job. An eclectic view of mixing and matching the good of the book with the good of quality scholarship could be a good thing indeed."
2,Content needs updating...,I have this workbook and I feel that the content needs to be updated. I photocopy the exercise pages and others but I would prefer a different workbook for Calligraphers. I don't use carpenters pencils...but my Sheafer Fountain Callgraphy pen broad nib works with this book. I think for what I paid for it that I could have gotten a better deal elsewhere.
4,"model builder ,for collections","I am a model builder and collector,I mainly use revell and amt kits because they are thouroughand parts and instructions are always accuratein retrospect these are all the cars I remember since childhoodand is very exciting,and nostalgic, I recommend these kits tothe beginner up to enthusists"
3,Lejos de lo que ha hecho antes,"El disco tiene 3 tracks muy buenos (""La Muerte Chiquita"", ""La Cuchilla"" y ""El Último Trago"", pero el resto suena poco inspirado.Su voz no suena tan poderosa como en otros materiales y la música en algunos temas pareciese un archivo midi descargado de internet o una pista de karaoke.Si quieres escuchar a Astrid Hadad en su máximo esplendedor consigue ""Corazón Sangrante"" o ""Ay!"", que incluye sus clásicos ""El Calcetín"" y ""La Tequilera""."
4,A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion,"I found this book to be rather comprehensive in terminology and volume of terms. I would have liked to have seen some dates for items, at least approximately. Eg: It is important to know when the zipper was invented in order to make a historically correct dress. But all in all the book has been helpful with definitions and illustrations."
1,not worth it,"This text was required for my costume history course. I found it lacking -- many definitions do not have images to illustrate them, making learning difficult. Definitions are not very descriptive: if you're looking for a comprehensive fashion dictionary, this isn't it."
2,A good Book for Costume buffs,"This book has a very vast colection of terms and types of dress throughout history. It reads like a regular dictionary, but consists souly of clothing terms. This would be a good book for those who plan to study costume and dress through history, but not a good book for those with just a casual interest."
5,the best hoop earrings,"i ordered these earrings because of the price . these are a great set with decent back clips i was really amazed at well made they were and delivery was super fast. love these earrings they are my favorie, pick your size"
5,Very nice earrings,"These earrings are exactly what I wanted and my gf likes them very much. She says the clasp works, they're light weight, and the color is not dull, it's shiny."
4,Nice for Price,"I was really surprised at the quality of this set of silver hoop earrings, especially priced as low as they were. I tend to lose earrings but they latch securely and I've already received several comments on them. Little do they know what a deal they were!"
1,Gold colored earrings that tarnish!,These earrings look great when you take them out of the package but after one use they tarnish and turn brown!
5,Can't live without them,"I love these earrings. The got here fast, were an excelent price. I wear three pair everyday. They are simple and well made. I just can't live without them."
5,king combines several threads,The problem considered in the book is of great interest and is rarely exposed in modern literature.The book has pleasing elementary expositions on geometry of groups and galios theory. The description of the use of special functions(theta etc) is good. My only complaint is that I would have liked to see more about equations beyond the quintic. Also it might be fun to see how his code works
4,A UFO book ahead of its time!,"This book was first written in the early 1970's when UFO's were still very much a fringe subject. Taking this into account one can appreciate how far ahead of its time this book was. The authors addess the UFO topic and its connection with the occult/paranormal. They chronicle the US Government's early projects (including the use of psychic mediums/channelers) in dealing with the UFO phenomenon and the startling results. Furhter, the authors give a Christian perpective to the subject and put forth a startling hypothesis. Of particular interest is the appendix, which is loaded with scientific information (even the late Dr. Carl Sagan is cited). The only reason I could not give this book 5 stars is because it is so old, but this book hold its own despite its age. This is one of the earliest books that deals with the UFO phenomenon as something that is absolutely real and as something that should not be ignored by anyone."
2,Not a Good First Choice,"The singing and acting in this video are very good--sometimes excellent. The video quality is also good, and the opera house, orchestra, and conductor do a fine job interpreting the score of this great opera. I have two major reservations in recommending this video wholeheartedly, and they are as follows:First, the modern costumes/props really detract from the opera production as a whole (the Don drinking Coke from a can is but one example). The costumes are somewhat plain and appear very low budget.Second, the sets are very minimal.I believe in accurate, full-bodied sets and elegant period costumes for this opera, and I guess these two major reservations made me dissatisfied with this production. I realize these issues may not detract from others' enjoyment, but at least you'll know what you're purchasing."
5,WebTV Hardware,"Dealing with this vendor was great. We had a small problem, but the vendor had his phone number included in the product description, so it was resolved quickly and to our satisfaction. He also provided email documentation on the progress of the shipment which provided assurance that the product was on the way."
1,Not what I paid for,"I was disspointed from this buyer. Unfortunately, the body spray smelled horrible. I've been using this sheer for a long time so I know what it's supposed to smell like. I ran out and the department store didn't have any in stock so I thought it would be easy to order online. Definately not what I paid for! I tried returning the product but they said I only had 5 days to return. Because I knew what I had ordered I didn't open the package rigth away. I had to throw it away!"
3,PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS,"CHIRALITY 4 really ends things up with a bang. Virtually every page features a breathtaking beauty rendered as only artist extraordinaire Satoshi Urishihara can do it!As usual, the story takes a bit of a back seat to the characters and how they relate to each other. And, once again, I find myself compelled to mention Urishara's fantastic renderings of the space babes.If you like HEAVY METAL magazine, then CHIRALITY is a safe bet for you!"
2,Thin Cheap Plastic,"I used the diaper genie for my newborn and by the time she approached her first birthday the thin plastic hinges on the diaper genie lid were broken and cracked off and the sharp thin plastic pieces under the lid (used to cut the genie plastic when the pail is full) also cracked off. The diaper genie does not completely take the stink away once your little one starts to eat solid foods (This includes the ""toddler"" diaper genie refills too). Also, I found the diaper genie refills to be expensive over the long run and most grocery stores carry a low inventory or are often out. Myth: There exists a diaper system where the stink will be completely hidden. Moms, Dads, don't let the expensive ""diaper systems"" fool you. Save yourself some money. Buy a regular diaper pail (I got one for $16) that uses cheap scented trash bags and change the diaper pail every night before your little one goes to sleep. You'll both be happy you did so and you can use the money you saved to do something fun."
1,Buy the Diaper Champ instead!,"The Diaper Genie was a gift 2 years ago when I had my son, and we thought it was the way to go. It's pretty good at holding in odors, I'll give it that. But it's difficult to use: open this, push that, shove the diaper down (without having it leak on your hand!), twist the thingie, close the lid..... Family and babysitters can never figure it out, so the diapers are left sitting on top of the lid. The mechanism that cuts the ""sausage"" of a bag with the dirty diapers in it warped almost right away, making cutting and changing the refill cartridges difficult. The refill cartridges get expensive, $4-$6 each depending on where you shop, and you have to change it about every 2 - 3 weeks based on single toddler use. We bought a Diaper Champ last week on a friend's recommendation (because the lid of the Genie snapped backwards, and baby #2 is due next month!!), and we LOVE it. Check it out instead."
1,Buy something else!,"Ugh. Great idea. But it is a pain in the *** to use! Doesn't work right - you twist and twist and it gets jammed in the top, or doesn't twist the diaper. You have to stick your hands in the diaper mess to get the diaper down low enough to twist off. I got this as a gift - good thing I didn't buy it myself or I'd be back at the store raising hell."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EITHER SYSTEMS,hi i have used both and they are horrible! the diapers will not seal. this is a waste of money trash bags work just as good the thing is a waste of plastic platex customer service needs working on do not suggest to anyone
1,I thew this thing away within one month,I thew this thing away within one month of having it. It was the biggest waste of money. We kept trying to figure out where this nasty smell was coming from in our house. We finally put the diaper genie outside. And the smell disappeared. I threw the thing AWAY. I'll stick with good old tied up grocery bags...
1,waste of money,"This product is complicated and does not even work right. The few times that I tried to use it, the diaper would not go down the tube, and it would not cut the string of diapers for disposable. What I ended up doing was throwing the diapers into the trash can and taking out the trash every night. Don't even waste you money to try it."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE,"This diaper genie product is horrible. My daughter's room always stunk when you walked in it. I even bought the stage 2 refills because my daughter is going on 2 and I always smelled the ""poops"" when I would walk into her room. DO NOT BUY A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I was able to return it to BRU and get my money back!"
1,Don't waste your time and money - look elsewhere,It stops twisting the bag after a few days. I returned it and got another piece a few days ago and found the same problem with the new one as well. Will now try diaper champ.
1,Peeewww!,"Yuck! Don't waste your time and money! This one is super stinky. The Diaper Genie II is much better. They both do waste plastic, but at least with the Genie II, you don't have to use an additional trash bag to throw out the old diapers."
2,"Okay, but not as good as the Diaper Champ","The Diaper Genie does do what it claims. It helps keep the odors in and looks much better than an overflowing trash can. I originally bought it thinking that it would do a better job of keeping odor trapped than diaper pails that did not use the twist and tie system and just used ordinary trash bags. But just to compare, I also bought a Diaper Champ....MUCH better. It did just as good of a job with the odor, was much easier to use, and I can use ordinary kitchen trash bags instead of expensive diaper genie refills. I got rid of the diaper genie and bought 2 diaper champs instead."
1,SMELLY>>>,I used mine for about a month. Getting the bags in is a pain and the SMELL. It just lingers throughout my baby's room. It went right in the dumpster.
1,Horrible,"We got this for our daughter, and it was a huge waste of money. From day 1 the thing smelled, and it was very hard for a 1st time sleep-deprived mom to figure out the darn thing. Plus it's a pain to empty, and you have to buy special diaper bags. After the first week it hardly got any use at all, and after a month it was in the garbage."
3,It's better than nothing I suppose...,"This is a review of the NEW & (supposedly) IMPROVED diaper genie... not the old one. I LOVED the old one. I had the old one with my 6 yr old and it was great.This new one ""seems"" easier but it doesn't work as well. My daughter is little and still uses little diapers (she wears size 2). In order to keep the bag twisted I have to wait and put in 2-3 diapers at a time just so that they are big enough to be caught in the clamps. And the first several diapers are never sealed separately. I never had these problems with the old one, and it by the way was just as easy to change the bag.The new genie does keep the smell pretty well (as long as you have them sealed properly). Though for the really smelly ones I first wrap the diaper in a plastic bag (the bread bags from glad... $.94 for a 75 box) before putting it in the genie. This is mostly because I only use the genie for really wet or poopy diapers not for the lightly wet ones."
2,Not all is cracked up to be.,If I would do it all over again I would not buy the diaper genie. I breast feed and my daughter has very stinky poops. I switched to stage 2 and my daughter is only 2 months old but I thought it would keep the smell out better. But it doen't. The smell goes away after a little bit but every time you open the diaper genie the smell comes out. And I have a bit of a problem every time I reset the genie. The first few diapers don't seem to want to turn in. The just untwist. Also it is little and I am having to empty it every 3 to 4 days.
2,Raved about but didn't stand up,"All I ever heard were great reviews on this product. Unfortunately, not long after having the product, my husband tried refilling the ""bag"" & ended up squashing the edges of the ""liner"" ring. Its very difficult to replace the ""bags"" now & I struggle to get the ring back on. I'd prefer something else that uses regular trash bags. My son is already 2 & I see no point buying anything new. I'd rather just use the regular trash pail for now & empty it more often.When we have another baby, I'll opt for another product than the Diaper Genie. Not a preference for me...."
2,Much too small,"I really liked the diaper genie at first. It is easy to use and def. hides odors. However, now that my son is in size 3 diapers it gets fulls so fast. I have to empty it every other day and it now goes through the refills really fast. I have stopped using it and am looking for another diaper pail system!"
2,What a pain!,"I bought the Genie despite my friends warnings against it. I wish I had listened! It does, in its defense, contain odors. However, you have to PUSH or STUFF the diaper and its contents which could possibly squish out when the diaper is forced into the Genie. This alone was enough to discourage my husband from even using the Genie. Then you have to twist to seal, which sometimes doesn't work because you have the correct ratio of bag to diaper for it to actually twist off and not open again when the next diaper is added. Also, it doesn't hold very many diapers, even for little guys. The refills are also a drawback, as they are expensive and you can't ever find coupons for them. I would definitely go for the Diaper Champ--"
1,Run from this product!!!!,"Ugh! Where do I start? This diaper pail is the biggest pain! When you put a new diaper in, it pulls open the twist that is supposed to hold the last diaper in, and yes, I am talking about the ""new and improved"" version. I'd hate to see what the original version was like! In addition, you have to really push the diaper in for it to work, and who wants to squish a dirty diaper in their hand like that? Yuck! I prefer simply dropping a diaper into a bin, not shoving it halfway down.Our local Babies R Us said that the Diaper Genie is the Number 1 most returned item in the store. Don't waste your time. Find something else. I mean, do you really want to wrestle with your diaper pail every time you change a diaper?"
4,Not as improved as it should be,"Overall, I think the Diaper Genie is a good product. It's pretty easy to use and refill. I don't think it will be good at keeping the odors concealed once my daughter starts solids. Right now it doesn't contain the smell of breastfed waste. Her nursery smells like butter when I walk in. And I change the Genie at least twice a week.My biggest complaint is not so much the smell, but that you have to push the diaper through to a level before it actually seals the dirty diaper. Pushing a full diaper home is not my idea of fun.I was in IKEA one day, in the changing room and the diaper pail in there was a pleasure to use. You just put the diaper in a hole and the top rotates and viola!! It's gone! No need to touch anything."
4,Not a bad product but...,I like how of course it hides the poopy smell that comes with a baby's diapers but when I open the bottom to empty it the film you put the diapers in is what stinks! It's not the poop smell but just a foul smell altogether. I received it as a gift so I guess I can't complain.
1,Terrible Product,"The genie was on my registery and I did receive it and now wish I had never put it on the list. Odor barrier my foot....My daughter is now 17 months old and the smell has gotten so bad that I have had to move the thing into the bathroom so she doesn't have to smell it. The other disadvantage is that it has never ""sausaged"" for me. I always wind up with a bag of nasty smelly diapers. The cutter never works and the refills are very pricey for the stage 2 ""film"".Despite the fact that it is supposed to ""keep pets out"" as I had read in one of the ads for it, IT DOESN'T!!! My 3 year old Labrador Retriever has no problem popping open the lid and ""retrieving"" a few dirty diapers for me. I plan on pitching the Genie and buying the Diaper Champ or Dekor system as reccomended by my friends who have older children."
1,Lid Breaks Off,"My Brother's family has gone through TWO diaper genies and we have now gone through ONE. The lid breaks off of them after a while, around a years worth of use, not abuse. I am very dissapointed by this and we can't be the only family that this happens to. I am going to try to reach Playtex to see if they will send a new lid for ours. It depends upon their response whether or not I will buy another one for our next child. It is no use buying Stage 2 refills as they are more expensive and do not control odor any better than the stage one. By the time they are old enough for Stage 2 they usually only poop one to two times a day and I could use the fresh air I get from taking the diaper out to our big trash can outside after changing that kind of a diaper anyways."
1,Diaper Champ is much better,"Don't get suckered into buying a contraption that forces you to spend money on proprietary bags. You can get a much better product, called the Diaper Champ. It's very easy to use and you can use whatever trash bag you want. You really won't need it, but if you are so worried about the smell, you can buy the Glad Oder Shield bags"
2,Smells putrid even with deligent cleaning,"I've had the diaper genie for a year now and I'm ready to review. The first 5 months the genie did well. I found it easy to use and it did contain the stink from my daughter's diapers. Then, well, she started solids and the genie started smelling REALLY bad. Like port-o-john on a hot day bad. I used Lysol to clean it twice a week and let it airdry, but it didn't help. The lid also broke off. I wouldn't suggest anyone purchase this unless they plan on buying another one every 2-3 months."
2,Not great for older kids,The Diaper Genie worked well for the first year of our son's life but lately (he is 16 months now) it has been really stinking. I washed it out and sprayed it with Lysol and it still stinks. I have stopped using it and am looking at other brands to use for our second baby- due in a month. The Wall Street Journal just ran a review of diaper disposal systems and they really liked the Diaper Dekor Plus.
3,Be sure to use correct liner!,"This genie works great keeping out the stench of dirty diapers as long as you remember to use the correct liners or empty it frequently. There is a stage one for formula/breast fed babies and a stage 2 for when your baby moves onto solids. After forgetting to move onto stage 2, I cannot get rid of the smell from the genie itself. It is easy to change liners, easy to empty and reasonably priced, but I won't make that same mistake twice about the liner stages!"
1,Pick A Different Diaper Pale.,"We bought the diaper genie on a recommendation from a friend, but even word-of-mouth suggestions only go so far. My daughter was breast-fed so when she was a newborn her poopy diapers didn't smell much. But the moment she started on solids, and we really needed the diaper genie to work, it FAILED MISERABLY. Her room started to smell almost right away. Even though the bags are scented it doesn't help. We used this item properly, and truly hoped that it would've worked, but it didn't and it was simply a waste of money. I recommend you choose another diaper pale instead of this one."
1,Gross,"I hate the NEW diaper genie. The refills are very hard to cut when the pail fills up. Also when it is emptied it smells sooo bad....take it outside before you even open it. Lastly....I had olny had about 5 diapers in there and they were all pee diapers and I opened it and there were bugs inside!!! Do not get this. I would reccommend the Diaper Champ or simply a small can with a doedorizer or air freshener, Safety 1st has a nice one."
2,Doesnt lose the smell,"bought it for my 2 month old nephew and he's on fomrula feeding and wow...the diapers smell awful even inside the genie diaper and the refills are expensive and they don't last more than 3 weeks, so don't waste your money, don't buy it!!!!"
2,Not the best in diaper pails,"I didn't know too much about diaper pails so when we got this, we thought it would work wonders. Wrong! The pail still has smells and you have to buy special containers to refill. My daughter goes though about one bundle a week and then we have to change it. We still however use it. It's been with us for about a year but I am defentially looking for a new one. Just make sure you have an air freshener near buy when you're changing the pail."
2,Not the best,"Spring for the extra $10 and get the Genie II or the Champ. Once your baby starts to eat foods (cereal, purees etc..)her/his BMs are going to make a much bigger stink than they do 0-4 months.I find that the twisting system is imperfect- for one thing, when starting a new ""bag,"" you can twist one diaper in there but once you get a second or even third diaper in there, the bag unwinds (so you end up having several diapers to a single ""pod""). It is not until you have so many diapers in there does it finally begin to twist them individually.Secondly, independent of the first issue, the ribs on the lid don't always catch the bag so it often takes time before your twisting becomes effective in order to ""close off"" the bag.Third, too often after using the razor, it continues to cut the bag even after you've released it. So if you start a new sleeve, it's still in cutting mode. Too wasteful."
2,I Threw Mine Out,"I used one of these for the first 8 months after my baby was born. It made me mad because it wouldn't twist properly, I had to press the top down and twist at the same time (using both hands). It was pretty frustrating as a new parent, just one more thing to make you feel inadequate, not being able to figure out the silly diaper pail. When we started solids it could not contain the smell (yes I used the #2 refills). And the plastic that the Genie is made from soaks up smells. I sprayed the inside with Lysol and let it air out between emptyings, and it still stank! Finally I soaked the darn thing in the bathtub in bleach. That finally got the smell away, but after a few more weeks of use it soaked up smell again. I threw the freakin' thing in the trash and now just use grocery bags for poopy diapers. I'm looking for a new decent diaper pail."
1,Diaper Genie = Your nursery will smell like a sewage plant,"We HAD a Diaper Genie, it's a total waste of money and plastic. The Diaper Genie was so hard to use and didn't do anything to stop odors. My son's room smelled as if we threw the dirty diapers in an open garbage. And the fact that you have to buy their ""special bags"" added insult to injury.We replaced it with THE FIRST YEARS CLEAN AIR DIAPER DISPOSAL SYSTEM. It's so much more effective and easy to use than the Diaper Genie, and you use your own tall kitchen garbage bags.The greatest thing about The First Years Clean Air Systen is that it can store about 6-7 days of my son's diapers without NO yucky odors. WOW!! We love this product so much. Our son's room smells clean with no poopy odors, and we save money by using our own tall kitchen bags. It's also very easy to change--no confusing bag twisting.STAY AWAY FROM THE DIAPER GENIE. You'll just end up having to replace it because your baby's room will stink terribly."
4,The best out of the rest,"I have tried almost every diaper pail out there and I always come back to the Diaper Genie. It just does the best job out of all the diaper pails available. I also didn't like having to buy expensive refills, but they last along time for me. I only use the Genie in the baby's bedroom (upstairs), when downstairs in the living room, I just use the regular kitchen trash can. I like the locking top feature, b/c my 2 yr old was trying to open all the other diaper pails we have tried. The sausage linking of the diapers is what keeps the odor locked into the bag, so you get no odor when the can is opened. It is pretty easy to cut the bag, open the bottom, and discard of the trash. I really like Playtex products, so it didn't surprise me that I have always stuck with the Diaper Genie,especially the new and improved one...it is MUCH better than the older models, just drop in the the new refill and tie the end of the bag. Keeps our nursey smelling diaper odor free."
4,The Best Yet,I have gone through about 4 or 5 different diaper disposal systems. This one seems to work the best. I wish I could find something that eliminates the odor completely but I think that's impossible. This new genie seems to be the best there is :)
4,Can't imagnie NOT having one!,"I have been using the same Diaper Genie for 19 months - and I can't imagine having anything different. I had a Diaper Champ for a month, and hated it. It didn't seem to make any difference in the smell of the room any better than a regular garbage can. Diapers smell - it's a fact, and the Genie seems to at least cut the smell by 3/4. I empty it every other day, the refills last me about 4-6 weeks (now that baby is older, probably mostly 4 weeks) and I buy a bunch of refills when they are on sale to help with the cost. I would probably spend just as much on regular garbage bags for the Diaper Champ as I do on the refills for the Genie.My daughter just broke the lid on hers off yesterday, and I am off to the store this afternoon to get another one!"
1,New & Improved.......what a joke!,"If this is considered a new & improved product, I would sure hate to see what the older version was like. This is my first experience with the diaper genie and DEFINITELY my last. In a matter of 6 months, I purchased 3 diaper genies as they have all broken.After reading all the rave reviews on the Diaper Genie, I expected more. I gave in to the idea of living with the continual odor that escapes everytime you open the lid. Yet at a friends house I realized there is bigger & better out there, not just life with the diaper genie. I finally came to my senses and switched to a BETTER diaper system (the diaper champ) and am much happier!!!I have several friends that are expecting their first child and I am steering them AWAY from the diaper genie as best as I can."
4,The best I've found,"After using the Diaper Genie for about a year, we decided to try the Diaper Champ to save money on the diposal refills. Well, after a month of smelling poop - we decided the refills were well worth the price! The Diaper Genie holds in odors much better than the Diaper Champ simply because it ""sausages"" each individual diaper. A garbage bag full of diapers (like you get with the Diaper Champ) is sure to stink. So - even with a 2 year old - we still use the Diaper Genie and I plan to use it again with our next child."
2,"it's OK, but not good.","I think it's OK, I dont think it holds very many diapers cause of the particular way it collects the diapers. I personally prefer the diaper champ."
4,does a good job,"i just purchased a new diaper genie as a shower gift for a friend. i've had one for 6 years through 3 babies and it functioned just fine. my babies rooms never smelled and i didn't find it a challenge to operate. i never found that having 3 diapers in the first ""sausage"" a big deal, closing the lid kept in most of the smell. I did wish it was bigger so i could stuff in more especially when you get to size 3 and 4 diapers and the cost of refills can be prohibitive for some but then again, i'm one of those creative people who figured out how to use regular trash bags in mine.If your bothered by the smell of dirty diapers for a few minutes when you change the bag, just think of what you are in for when the real fun of potty training starts."
1,Do not buy this!,"I am extremely dissatisfied with my Diaper Genie. The refill bags are expensive (and keep in mind that once your baby starts eating solids, you have to purchase the toddler refill which is more expensive then the stage 1 refill). It really doesn't keep the odor out. Sometimes it's difficult to twist the bag closed, and just recently the lid broke off! We only had the diaper genie for 10 months, and now I'm looking at other brands, I'm considering the diaper champ, since it's had some good reviews. Think twice before purchasing this overated item. The main reason why I purchased it was to keep the odors from smelling up the room, and I was willing to pay the cost of the refills, but it didn't even do that. If I could give this product 0 stars I would."
1,Don't bother!,"I received this as a gift and it's a royal pain. The worst thing is that when you empty it (every other day!)the next few diapers you put in go straight to the bottom. I went to the diaper genie web site to make sure I was doing everything right and I was, it's just a bad design. I am sorry I didn't register for another brand with better design and less expensive refills."
4,Like it but not that easy to use,"I like it but I have to say it's not the easiest thing to use. I do like not dealing with really smelly diapers stinking up a room but I do have to say replacing the cartridge is a pain. Could be made easier, if I figure that one out i will let their company know."
3,Wouldn't buy it again.,"I have used the diaper genie since my son was born (he just turned two). But now I have found that the back of it has cracked around the top and that the refills are more difficult to replace (probably from use). Also when you graduate from infant to toddler refills the price goes up and you need to buy refills more often which means more $$$. The toddler refills are going for $5.99 each where I live. It's getting too expensive. I'm now pregnant with my second child and will not buy another Diaper Genie, instead I'm going to try the Diaper Champ. The Diaper Genie served us well when my son was an infant (once I figured out how to use it, which is another story), but once he got older and his diapers became fuller and stinkier the Diaper Genie was no longer cost effective."
1,"!!This ""Genie"" should have never been let out of the lamp!!","Good concept, bad execution. This pail has the specific liner insert that you HAVE to buy to make it work. One more trip to the store you shouldn't put yourself through! The ""spin"" mechanism (to twist the liner and block the smell) does NOT always engage and just spins for its own sake. The cutting mechanism has worked as advertised 1 out of 10 times. That's 10% in my book, that's not good enough when you are tired, the wife has asked you to empty the pail in the dark of night and your fumbling with a knife or scissors to cut the bag off. Need I say more?!?I've just added the ""Diaper Champ"" to my baby registry and am glad I saved the box so I can put the Genie back in it and take this back!P.S., the ""1 star"" is really a "".50 star"" that gets rounded up to 1."
2,Stinky Genie,"We've had the Diaper Genie for 14 months. It has started to smell so badly lately, I gag when I put a diaper in. We have washed and washed it. And, in 14 months, I have never figured out how to use the refills. My husband has to do it every time. I haven't found anyone that likes the diaper system they use. Same problems with the Champ, and the Dekor one from Right Start - you can only buy refills there, and it's pricey. My friend said it's not worth it."
1,WAITED 10 YEARS TO RATE!,"When I was a new mom ten years ago, building my baby registry, reading Amazon reviews, and since then over the years (three kids later), I have been waiting or the day I could come back, seasoned, and pick my best and worst. This makes the WORST list! No matter what, no diaper pail is worth the hassle. If you really really want the mess/smell out of your room/house, keep a supply of recycled grocery plastic bags on hand; tie that nasty thing up and throw it out in the garage/garbage can. PLEASE resist the urge to buy a diaper pail - use that registry list for a few sets of high quality white twin sheets and mattress pads; because in a few years when that baby goes in a bed, you'll be so happy to move to twin sheets and white matches everything through the years no matter the room theme :)trust me :)"
3,It works,The Diaper Genie is okay. It is easy to use but hard to empty. My husband has to do it because the cutter is hard to press down. I only put wet diapers in it becuase I couldn't stand the odor of the poopy ones. We wrap those up in a plastic bag and put them out to the trash immediately. I guess I wasn't paying attention when I registered because all I ever heard about was a Diaper Genie. If I would have looked and read the reviews I think I would have went for the Diaper Champ.
2,Changing the liner is very complicated,I do like having a disclosed place for the smelly diapers but I could live without the difficulty on how to get the new package of liners back in Genie. My husband has to do it. I would go for something more expensive that I have seen on the market that is easier and masks smells better.
3,"Plastic absorbs smell, so you have to empty it often!","The design of this item is nicely engineered, but maybe could have been made of a less absorbent plastic, as it becomes irreversably stinky over time! Be sure to read the manual and don't be discouraged if it takes a couple times to get use to replacing the bag cartridge. We methodically emptied it at the end of each day, but over time the plastic absorbed the smell of the soiled diapers and we just couldn't get it to wash out - even after soaking it in bleach water overnight (not recommended as the ammonia from the diapers and chlorine in the bleach could potentially make a poisonous gas). We ended up throwing ours away after 7 months of use and resorted to putting the wet diapers in a small, metal, plastic bag-lined, covered garbage can and taking the soiled ones directly out to the dumpster (in a tied, small plastic bag). This meant more leg work, but no smell!"
1,The Diaper Champ is far superior,"The diaper genie was a waste of money. People on a limited budget cannot afford the refills. The ""sausaging"" kept coming undone every time I changed the genie. The worst of it was when my baby started using larger diapers the genie needed to be changed at least once a day. The Diaper Champ is about the same cost initially and saves you money because you can use any type of garbage bag, even generic and it eliminates the smell just as well as the genie. The bonus of the Diaper Champ is that is so simple to use. I disposed of the genie when my son was 6 months old and have been using the Champ for 3 years. Lets face it, until your children are potty trained you will be dealing with stinky diapers which are costly anyway, why waste extra money on something that does not work as well as they say it does."
1,Save your money!,"I did not have the ""new & improved Diaper Genie"" I had an older version that someone gave to me. In fact she gave it to me because she didn't like it. One thing the refills are expensive! When emptying the Genie the diaper on the bottom never seem to come out. I always had to reach in grab the last one! YUCK! I had to keep sissors in the garbage can so I could cut the one that wouldn't come out! And it doesn't take away all the odors! Maybe the new & improved one is better to use but the older ones are awful!!"
1,Bad Product,"What a horrible piece of junk. First of all it's a pain to empty and takes to much time, the cutter doesn't work. The first 5 or so diapers do not twist and you wind up with a bag of them at the bottom. To top it off it smells. There is no oder protection not even with the thick stage 2 bags. What a waste. I would never reccomend this product to anyone. It is a must not have. I switched to the Neat Diaper Disposal System. So much better, threw my diaper genie in the trash."
1,too much trouble,The diaper genie is not user friendly. It is hard to figure out how to open at first. I forgot to mention it to a baby-sitter and when she leaned over to figure it out my 11 month old son fell off the table and ended up in the emergency room. I have purchased the diaper champ for my second child and love it. The best part is it takes only one hand and has much more room. What a relief.
1,New and Improved is a LIE,"For some reason, I didn't listen to my friends. They said not to even bother with the Diaper Genie. But I said- ""This one is NEW AND IMPROVED"". What a MISTAKE. The turning system to cut the bags is joke. Sometimes, the cutter catches, other times it doesn't. And when you start from scratch after disposing the diapers, getting it started again is a pain. Sometimes I have 3 to 4 diapers in one bag because each time I push a diaper through the clamps, it goes into the old bag, and once again you have to start from scratch. This is such a piece of garbage- I can't believe I've kept up with it for 9 months. I was trying to go as long as I could because I found the system 2 refills for 1/2 off at a store that was going out of business. I would rather lose my money and save my sanity and get an new system. Needless to say, I'm going out today to purchase a new diaper disposal. After reading the reviews, I can see I'm not the only one."
1,Just Say No,"This was horrible. We couldn't even figure out how to make it work. It just didn't make any sense. And the refills are impossible and soooo terribly heavy. After a couple months of walking every diaper to the outside trash can, I invested in a Diaper Champ, which is a dream. Easy to use and clean and affordable to USE unlike the expensive and complicated Genie."
1,I did not like this at all!,"I don't know why I chose this product over the others on the market. Perhaps it was because it was the only one I had heard of in use. It was not a pleasant experience. First, it holds very few diapers and needs to be emptied frequently. The liners are expensive and when you are spending your money on diapers is the last thing you think to buy. I still like the concept of twisting the diapers though I am not sure why, but it did not always work until a load of diapers hit the bottom of the pail. My husband was so frustrated by this product that I always ended up putting the diapers in it. I have since used a first years pail that works much better with larger capacity."
1,just an OK diaper pail,"I registered for the Diaper Genie because it seemed to be the most popular. Now that I have 2 of them (one upstairs and one downstairs), I wish I would have registered for the Diaper Dekor. The Diaper Genie does not hold a lot of diapers, is tricky to use with one hand and its very difficult when you first start it after emptying it. I would not recommend this product. The only plus about it is that it does keep the odor to a minimum only when its closed. I would recommend the Dekor instead."
1,Don't waste your money,"A friend gave us a Diaper Genie and a pack of bags before our first baby was born. We had a hard time just figuring out how to get the bags in it properly, and a few test-uses convinced us that this was a piece of useless junk. We gave it away before the baby came, and bought a Diaper Champ instead. The Champ is far and away easier to use, and you can use any trash bag in it--you aren't required to buy Playtex's bag system. If I could've given the Diaper Genie zero stars, I would have."
1,JUNK!,This thing is junk and a waste of space. It does not twist correctly. The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it. Don't waste the money.
5,I LOVE this Diaper Genie!,"I had one of these when I had my first born 8 years ago, and now that I had another in June 2007, I thought I'd try the new Diaper Genie II. I HATED the new version! It LITERALLY stinks! There is absolutely no odor control! If I had just one poopy diaper in there, you could smell it every time you added a new dirty diaper, and then the smell would linger even after the lid was closed! So I bought the original Twistaway, and I LOVE it! With this one, there's no smell not only because each diaper is twisted up, sealing in the smell, but the liner is lightly scented. The new one doesn't seal the diapers and the liners aren't scented. The new one is also harder to empty, due to the fact that you have to empty it out from the MIDDLE for some reason, instead of the bottom.I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,I can't stand this thing!!!,"We purchased this when we had 2 foster children in diapers. I didn't like purchasing the refills constantly and found that when I actually got pregnant, the smell of the deoderizer in the toddler refills made me gag. I tried using the infant refills but they were so thin, they broke. Now that we're having our own baby, I registered for the Diaper Champ - no refills needed and I can choose the scent of the bags I put in!!!"
1,Stinks,"I totally agree with C. Robbe ""Momrobbe""!! You can get a big paint bucket with a lid for around $5 at wal-mart and use much less expensive bags. It really isn't such a chore to take the bag out each night to control the odor. You can even hang one of those toilet bowl deodorizers over the side to help control odor too (just don't unwrap the whole thing)."
1,Amazon's delivery of the Diaper Genie,"I bought this Diaper Genie off of a friend's registry. I did not have it wrapped and sent it to my address, since the closest store (Toys R Us) only had the old one in stock.I am sure the Diaper Genie as a product is fine, but I was very concerned when it arrived: Amazon.com just slapped a mailing sticker right on the actual Diaper Genie box and shipped it off. I do a lot of online shopping, and was shocked to see they did not put it in another box to ship. The product box, when it did arrive, was a bit banged up. I did not have the time to complain/return it/ask for another to be shipped properly.DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT TO BE SHIPPED TO YOU, UNLESS AMAZON.COM MAILS IT WITHIN ANOTHER BOX. Hopefully, if you ask/pay for it to be giftwrapped, they won't just slap a mailing sticker on it and send it on it's way..."
3,it's okay,"I have the so-called new and improved diaper genie. I hate to think of what it was like before they improved it! Yes, it does it's job by masking the odor of dirty diapers but from what I hear from other people with babies, they had the hardest time figuring the thing out! My daughter was 3 months old before I finally figured out how to use the scissor button! i just wish there was a little less to it and is easier to work"
1,Stinks,"This diaper pail is cheap, for how expensive it is. The plastic is thin and the odor is awful. It worked for about two weeks, then the odor came. I washed it with soap and water and it helped for a short time. After that every time you opened it to put in the diaper, the smell just about knocked you down. The cutting system on mine only worked ""sometimes"". I had to keep sicsors by the pail. NOT GREAT"
3,Great product ... just not for me,I purchased this product but after about a week of use I realized it just wasn't for me. It seemed like a waste of money when I could just walk the diapers out to the trash and save the hassel of the diaper genie. I ended up selling it to a neighbor for half the price that I paid but at least I didn't waste tons more purchasing all of those refills. :)
2,Doesn't hold many diapers and a pain to change,"My husband really wanted this and we received it as a gift for our 3rd child. This is just not convenient at all. While it does cut down any odor, it doesn't hold many diapers. It is not the easiest thing to empty and then trying to put another bag in is not easy either. You have to buy the specialty Diaper Genie bags that you can't find just anywhere. A person would be just as well to buy some sort of small garbage can with a lid and buy any type of small garbage bag. ""The Diaper Champ"" cuts down on odor while any garbage bag can be used."
5,Excellent product!!,"This is one of the best baby gifts we received! It is easy to use and keeps the nursery smelling fresh. As for the cost of the bags, we only use it for ""dirties"" and our daughter is 2 1/2 months old and we are still on the first canister. We empty it once a week on garbage day and never deal with the smell of dirty diapers. It is definitely worth having."
1,A piece of garbage - no pun intended!,"This is a very cheap product. After less than one month of use, the cutting function broke. Shortly there after, the ""twisting"" feature also broke. Now I have a glorified garbage can. Wish I had read the other reviews before buying this!!"
1,Stinky,"After our Diaper Champ started to stink, we decided to get another diaper system. We went to the store and debated between the Diaper Genie and the Neat. We went with the Genie and were very sorry. It smelled just as bad as the Champ and was so much harder to use. We went back and got the Neat system. We love it! No stink and pretty easy to use! Don't waste your money on the Genie."
2,"Handles odors, but there are better ways to do that","The Diaper Genie system has you drop in a dirty diaper, then twist the plastic liner to seal off odors. You end up with sort of a daisy chain of diapers wrapped in a long, twisted-up plastic bag. It uses a LOT of plastic. Those diapers surely won't decompose until eons after all the other diapers in the landfill.I used the Diaper Genie with my first child. I hope the new version takes care of the many, many problems mine had, including the lid that breaks off. But it still uses that twisted-bag system. I have the Diaper Dekor for my second child. It uses a lot less plastic and I haven't noticed any odor problem. Plus, I can use it with one hand, which is a huge benefit. I don't have to let go of my baby while I drop the diaper into it."
5,Well worth buying the refills,"We waffled on whether to buy the Genie or buy a pail that doesn't require the special refills, but because my husband has a very sensitive nose (and we have a bassett hound in the house) we decided to try the Genie. We've been using it for 9 months now, and we have no complaints. When you open it to put a diaper in, you don't smell anything, which is great-- otherwise, my husband would never change a diaper! Recently, our daughter had the stomach flu and some very smelly diapers, but you couldn't smell anything from the diaper pail. One suggestion I have for buying the films: shop around, it surprised me how much difference in price there was between Babies R Us, Target and Walmart-- it was more than a few pennies."
4,Can't Believe The Bad Reviews,"I agree that this product does take some getting use to. You can't push the diapers too far down or they will go past the grabbers, you have to push down as you turn the cutter, you have to twist the bags about 4 times before you close it up, and changing the refill is kind of a hassle. But all in all, I'm very happy with my diaper genie. After switching my daughter to solids we still had some stage one refills on hand, and we soon learned you really need to switch to stage 2 too keep the stink out. And if the last reviewer thinks breast-fed baby poopy stinks then she doesn't know what she is in for. I don't think my daughter needs her diaper changed less than any other baby, but I don't need to empty the genie any more than every couple of weeks. She is at daycare during weekdays though. I feel our diaper genie has kept my daughter's room sanitary and stink free and I would buy this product again if I had to, although it is holding up perfectly."
1,Still awful...0 stars,I used the diaper genie with my first two children and hated how hard it was to use and how expensive it was to refill. The diaper champ is now out and I have used it with my third baby. It is wonderful...so much easier and more cost efficient. Don't waste money on the diaper genie. One $10 box of trashbags will fill the diaper champ us as long as your baby is in diapers!!
2,The old Diaper Genie was better...,"I honestly hate the new Diaper Genie. Yes, it was a pain to replace the older version's refills but at least it kept the odor out. We finally decided to replace our old one with a fresh one. (The other was not so ""fresh"" anymore.) What a waste. We don't even use it because you put two diapers in and the room stinks. We never had this problem with the older version. I say go for the diaper champ or the one that uses just regular diapers. We've had success with both of those."
1,WAY too much trouble,"This product is WAY too much trouble for the sake of stinky diapers. I used it for about two weeks. At first I didn't even understand how to use it. I even kept the instructions on my changing table. My husband, being the man that he is, gave up and wouldn't use it because it was too complicated. The inside liner kept ripping, I couldn't get the diapers down into it without takeing off the ring thing on top. Then I had to put it back together in order to twist the diaper down into it. Then, trying to change the liner was IMPOSSIBLE!!! Anyways, I should have asked my friends. They all had the same complaints. I ended up with a normal Safety First diaper pail, and though it doesn't mask odors completely, it works with out any trouble."
4,Keeps the room smelling good,This is easy to use and keeps the smell out of my son's room. Only downisdes are that I feel like I have to empty it too often and I have to constantly buy the special refill systems.
2,Great until you have to refil it.,"It was a little hard to figure out at first, and not something to do one handed, but seemed to keep in the smell of the newborn diapers. We were happy with it (bought it used...with the bag in it).Then we had to refil it. Very tricky. Each time got trickier--there's this ring that's supposed to fit into the diaper refill. Well, it doesn't--every time I've had to force it. Forcing it caused little bends in the ring that made it fit worst. The time before last that I changed it I actually cut my hand on it (and it's plastic). Then this last time trying to force the dang thing on I finally broke the Genie--it won't close now.It doesn't keep the stench in on older baby diapers that well anyways. Every time you twist it a little cloud of stench comes up, and when you change it better take it outside first. I'm sick of it. I'm going to try something else."
2,This is not a great product,"It takes two hands to dispose of a diaper when using the Diaper Genie. This makes it impossible to dispose of a diaper when holding an infant. Additionally, this system doesn't have a very large capacity. We'd end up needing to change it every one to two days! Do yourself a favor--buy the Diaper Champ. It's easy to use and holds many more diapers."
1,From a Mother of 3,"I've had a diaper Genie since I was pregnant with my first son. We had the older style wide mouth genie and it lasted through both my boys. Finally the hinge on the back of the lid broke so we purchased one of the newer models when we had our third child. The hinge on the lid of the new models is totally useless. I've already gone through one of them and the second one is breaking as well. My daughter is 15 months and I'm getting ready to have to purchase my 3rd diaper system since she was born. I'm really disappointed in the new design. The plastic is cheap. I hate to try something new or buy a completely new system when my 3rd and last child is so near the potty training age, but it looks like it will be inevitable that I have to. I don't have a system to recommend over the Genie, but I can't give the genie high reviews either. Keep looking is all I can say."
1,Can not handle twins,"We had received a diaper champ that uses regular trash bags but needed another diaper pail for downstairs and bought a diaper genie.....we ended up throwing it away. With twins boys the diaper genie just could not handle the volume of diapers. Not only that but it was too complicated for my technically challenged mother-in-law so I'd come home to diapers sitting on the bathroom counter because she couldn't figure out how to throw them away (even after a demonstration). Neither my husband or I wanted to empty it because it was quite a process compared to the Diaper champ. We ended up buying another diaper champ it uses regular trash bags so no running out of refills, and I add a little bit of baking soda in the bottom of every new bag and it controls the odor better than the diaper genie did."
4,"Two Kids, one on the was","I had the first one and found it difficult to cut the liner. The cutter needed to be removed and attached every time you needed to use it. It did however, last for 6 years, between babies, toddlers, and relatives! This new one is much easier to use, I just need to make sure my daugther hasn't already tried to cut the liner herself, when I twist off an old diaper in there!"
2,"good, then bad","I used the Diaper Genie since my son was born. It worked great the first year or so, while he was mainly breastfed, but once he started eating different foods it sucked. At 16 months, the Genie seems to have developed it's own poop smell when it is EMPTY! Even a thorough disinfecting doesn't make a dent in it's stench. We had to throw it away because of the smell, eventhough it is in good working condition. A friend of mine had the stinky smell problem ever since she got it. I would NOT buy another one. I just bought a Safety 1st Neat system because it boasts to be truly odor free. We'll see..."
2,Not a must have item!,"When having our first child I had the impression that this was a MUST have item for the nursery. I would have to say I gave in and bought it and wish I would have spent my money on another item that was needed. I ended up using grocery bags that were in our home already instead of buying expensive refill. Another complaint is that when you start the ""string of sausage"" it is rather difficult and doesn't always start off well. I would just suggest putting your money on a better item."
1,"Okay, if you like touching dirty diapers....","I thought the diaper genie was a wonderful idea. But I realized later how yucky it really was to use. You need to push (not drop) the diaper through the clamps. Have you ever tried pushing on a full dirty dity? YUCK!! Emptying the bags is no picnic either. It does cut the bag, but you still have to slide the mound of diapers out of the pail, which start untwisting the minute you pull it out. It is just awkward!The product is great at keeping the smell down. The refills also add up after a while.I recently bought the CHAMP and it is a drastic improvement. I use any bag (grocery/trash etc) that I have in the house. I place (not push) the diaper and use the clean handle to rotate it to the bag. I LOVE IT!! I had the Genie for a year and threw it in the trash after one week with the Champ!!"
1,Don't bother,"This thing is worthless and not worth the expense. While I pride myself on being somewhat educated and mechanically-inclined, this thing tests my patience when it comes to replacing the refills. Buyer beware."
1,Waste of money!,"Don't get fooled! For a newborn who is breastfed, you really don't need anything to seal in the odor--breastfed poop doesn't smell bad. The refills are absurdly expensive.If you really want to be frugal, use cloth diapers (the modern ones are as easy to put on as disposables, and doing a load of laundry, when you have a newborn, is easier than running to the store to get more diapers!) and just a simple diaper pail, like the Easy Saver. You can cloth diaper your baby for about $200 for the first year, as opposed to $1500 for disposables--not even including buying outrageously expensive glorified garbage bags for the Diaper Genie!"
1,This product stinks like a dirty diaper,"We registered for this product after hearing raves from other people. We could not be more disappointed. Among other things, we were never able to figure out how to get this thing to work. My husband and I have four masters degrees between us, and my father is an engineer. And yet we still could not figure out how to get this thing to work. Out of depseration, we took the genie to the local baby store and after 45 minutes even the staff could not figure this product out. How much genius does it take to make a diaper pail this complicated. We are much happier with the diaper champ."
1,"great idea, but... it sucks!!!","I bought it for my 3 month old baby and he's on fomrula feeding and wow...the diapers smell awful even inside the genie diaper and the refills are expensive and they don't last more than 2 weeks, so don't waste your money, don't buy it!!!!"
1,No Fun!,"It really is a hassle. It does keep the smell out even if you don't do things exactly right, but it does take a scientist to figure this thing out!!"
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"The Diaper Genie is a horrible buy. I am just thankful I got it as a gift and didn't have to pay for it. You can't even work the stupid thing. My husband is a Mechanical Engineer, and even he couldn't figure the thing out. Save your money, get a garbage pail and a plug in."
2,Not a must-have for breastfed babies,"We registered for this and believed that it would be an absolute necessity, but I wish we hadn't, at least right away. Because if you breastfeed your baby, the diapers really DON'T stink that much! It's not worth the extra money for the expensive refills, so we've just been plopping diapers in the regular trash can which goes out a few times a week. I have noticed no particular odor since we started doing this. However, once she starts solids, I'm going to get the diaper genie back out and use it again.My other complaint is that the cutting mechanism doesn't work properly. Every time we've tried to empty it, we ended up getting out a pair of scissors."
1,a VERY BIG mistake !!,"As a first time mom I thought this would be a great item to have, oh my was a WRONG!! Fisrt it was dificult to figure out how to use it then once I did it just never seems to work the way it should! My son is now three months old and I have used it maybe 10 times and every time just end up very frustrated! I would recomend doing some research and finding a better product! If I had'nt thrown away the box this item would have been returned a long time ago!"
1,It Does Stink,"We purchsed the original Diaper Genie 2 years ago for our first child and did not like it. We're expecting again and saw that there was a ""New & Improved"" one on the market. It may be new, but it has not improved! It does not contain odors at all. We had to change the liner for just 1 stinky diaper. It is also a hassle to change and empty the liners. It is more convienent and cheaper to use old plastic grocery bags for your regular trash."
5,A must-have for the diaper'd child,"Of all the things I use, this definitely is ranked the highest. We've been using this since we brought our son home from the hospital. It is easy to use; so simple to change the refill.... and it really keeps his nursery odor-free. I'll admit that I don't empty the pail as often as I should - the manufacturer directions say every 2-3 days - I probably get around to it more like once a week. We fill this sucker to the brink before we empty it and have never had a problem with odor. My son is on solid food and it's never been an issue. Tip: Spray the inside of the pail with Lysol each time you empty the pail. It disinfects and kills any suspicion of odor."
1,Buy a Diaper Champ,"I bought 1 diaper genie and 1 diaper champ. The Genie was tried several times throughout the year and each time was stuck back in the closet. I read several reviews and help guides and just couldn't get the thing to work without the bags tearing. It was a lot of work, basically, to get it to function. When I got it to function, it was satisfactory in stopping diaper smell. But it was a ton of trouble to function.In contrast, the Diaper Champ was simple to use and simple to clean. It could be done with 1 hand (so you can hold on to the baby at the same time), whereas the Genie needs 2. It needs to have its bags changed out less often than the Genie because it stops the smell very well.So I bought a 2nd Champ and sold the Genie to a 2nd hand store. Save yourself a step and just get the Diaper Champ."
1,Don't bother.,"I work in a baby store and work with this product a lot. I would highly recomend NOT getting it. It's too much of a pain twisting and cutting and buying the refills. Granted the refills do last awhile, its money that could be spent better. I would recomend getting the Diaper Champ. We actually have this in physical use in the store and I do have to change it at night. So long as you use it properly..ie flip the handle over and dump the diaper..there is no smell or stink! and the great thing is..you can use a regular size trash bag!Don't waste your money on a diaper genie."
1,More of a pain than a help!,"This takes two hands, expensive refills, and it still allows the smell. Not worth it at all. We went to a regular trash can that we empty in the evening! So much easier!!!"
2,not so great,the only really good thing abot the diaper genie is you dont have to smell dirty diapers. it has more cons however. i dont like having to purchase special refills. and the hassel to empty it makes me wish i never put this item on my baby registry
1,GENIE GETS KO'D BY THE CHAMP,"The Diaper Genie is very unreliable whether it is new & improved or not. Our was tossed to the curb after only 2 months. First, the cutter mechanism did not seem to ""reach"" the bags consistently. Also, the ""twist"" mechanism was unreliable. There were just too many problems & you had to buys their bags. Our Diaper Champ, on the other hand, has been in daily use for over 2 years with no problems."
1,Worked well for about 2 months,"I don't see what's ""new & improved"" about this diaper pail. There is still an obscene odor and the cutter hardly works at all. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,"""New and Improved"" - HUH?????????????????","We replaced an earlier version of the Diaper Genie with this ""New and Improved"" one. Big mistake. Wish I had kept the box so I could mail it to Playtex with the the stinky diapers that are stuck in it. Can't cut the bags, so I have to use scissors to get the bags out. And the kid's room smells worse than a public bathroom. I have never used another brand, so I can't give you a recommendation, other than to avoid this product. And, PLAYTEX, if you are reading this, take the Genie off the market until it is truly ""new and improved""!"
5,"great product, great company","Keeps the nursery smelling fresh. The real kicker that gives this 5 stars though is that Playtex stood behind their product. After several months of use, we accidentally knocked it over and the hinge broke. Playtex shipped us a new unit for free, and sent us a pre-paid label to return the broken unit. We've been using it for a year and a half now and are very pleased with it."
1,"hated it, threw it in the trash",We absolutely hated the diaper genie. It never worked right. After suffering with repeatedly having to retie the knot to start the sausages over we finally took it to the dumster. We started using the regular trash can and emptied it nightly until we got the diaper champ. We highly recommend the diaper champ. Do not waste your money on the diaper genie.
3,Ok product but found better option,"I received this as a gift and like most other moms, found the refills to be expensive. I opted for a step lid pail purchased at a discount store and use regular grocery bags. I empty the pail daily which keeps the odor down and find that I have no problems...and save googobs of money."
1,It's a better buggy whip,"This is a fine product. But it's also a silly one. Once upon a time, the Diaper Genie's approach was the best idea out there -- a better mousetrap, no question. But the Diaper Champ is simply a better design...because it's simpler.The basics have been brought in several reviews here: diapers stink, you can't change that. These devices are just ways to store and eventually throw them out with minimal odor. Both devices do a decent job of that. But the Diaper Genie requires expensive, proprietary refills to do so.Simple is better. Get a Diaper Champ: any bag works & the flip-lever design is really really easy to use."
2,Nursery still smells like poo...,"I have not used any other diaper pails so I am no expert on this. I am used to the operation of Diaper Genie and do not find it that difficult to use ""butt"" I don't think this pail contains the smell really well. Before Katie was born I bought a plug in wall freshener unit in a pretty rose smell and her room always smelled so nice. Now it smells like a diaper and she only makes #2 every other day and I empty the Genie at least one a week. I am thinking of trying the level 2 refills before I buy a whole different unit though so maybe that will help. Wiping the Genie out with disinfecting wipes and spraying with Lysol helps a little. I can change a poopie diaper like a pro but everytime I empty out the ""strand of pearls"" I gag."
1,Just bad,"Difficult to use: you have to bend down to operate this machinery while your baby is wiggling on the changing table. Emptying it requiers two people (one holds the genie, another garbage bag under it) and PHD. My mother in law who is babysitting my daughter still can't learn to do it. And to add to all its good features, after 7 months of use, its lid broke off. That's it. I'm buying DiaperChamp."
1,On Shipping & Handling,"I ordered this item as a gift. It came in today, delivered in the actual box...not within another protecting box. The box is beaten up badly and is not presentable for a gift. There are no directions and warrenty info (missing?). I won't know if it is damaged until I give the gift.Two Big Thumbs Down on delivery by BabiesRUs & Amazon."
1,This STINKS!,The genie works great prior to a baby eating solid foods. Shortly thereafter the pail really starts to stink. My daughter is 13 months old and I have already thrown out 2 genies. Find an alternative!
1,Do not buy this product!!!!,"This product is a hassle!!!! Sure it works at minimizing odor, but putting in refills is a pain in the patootie!!! I have tried on multiple occasions to change it out quietly after my daughter has fallen asleep but have rarely been successful. The thing that twists the plastic wrap is almost impossible to get into the genie refill. Trust me, buy something else!! My daughter is now 4 mos. old and I would rather just stick her diapers in a bag and throw them away verses using this piece of junk."
2,Not worth it,I found it to be complicated to use (as did my husband). It still smells when you open it. Don't waste your money!! I read these reviews and still added it to my registry. I should have returned it and listened...
1,EWWW,"As a first time mom, I thought I needed everything, well this is one item you can do without. First off the refills are to expensive for plastic bags, with a little baby powder smell to it. Second, it doesn't cut throw the bag, half the time I would have to use a knife, you can't really turn it and when you can turn it, well it just doesn't cut. Last, THE SMELL DOES NOT COME OUT!!!!, I tried everything, and it has this lasting smell of well you know. I found that just empting the trash everyday keeps the smell out. I would not recomend this Item to any one."
2,don't bother get the diaper champ instead,"When I was considering items for my registry, I thought that this would be a good thing to have. After i began using it, i began to like it less and less until i finally stopped using it in favor of a regular trash can. my biggest complaint is that you have to push the diaper down deep into the bottom of the container. this is VERY messy espesially when the diaper is really full. my second complaint is that it doesn't hold very many diapers. my husban bought me the diaper champ yesterday, so far, i like it much better than the genie. the only thing that i like better with the genie is that it is smaller than the champ"
1,WASTE!!!,"This thing is horrible! The bag tears and is difficult to put it in. It does a bit to help the smell, but it doesn't eliminate it like it claims. A big waste of money."
1,Broken in 5 minutes,"We had the original Diaper Genie, and although it was difficult to change the refills at first, we thought it worked well. (until our son was about a year old, when it developed this interminable smell, which would not leave even after cleaning it with full-strength bleach). Now we are expecting our second son, and my 2 year old was helping me put one of his diapers in the New Diaper Genie, and somehow managed to break the entire lid assembly, exposing two small gears that would be choking hazards to a small child. I was very surprised and disappointed."
1,Not worth the money,"I found this to be a huge waste of money. The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail. The worst part was the odor. It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it. I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper, better option."
4,Great System!,"I have used Diaper Genie for seven years now. I purchased the New Genie to replace my old worn out one, and it is easier to use. The only problems I have is occasionally the plastic won't cut if I get things in the wrong position. You have to learn from experience to get the technique down right. Be sure after cutting the plastic to turn the handle while open to get the cutter to click back to the original position. I have loved using Diaper Genie! It keeps things so neat!An experienced mom and grandma."
2,Diaper Champ is better,"We had this product less than a year before we switched to the diaper champ. It was fine at first before we fed our baby to solids. The smell would leak out. We clean the diaper genie every week. Maybe the reason the smell was quite strong was becuase we just use it for the BM diapers and regulars trash can for the other diapers that way we would not have to constanly buy refills.It's not a bad prouduct, I suggest emptying it out daily. I would strongly reccommend buying the diaper champ keeps out the smell."
5,New Mom Loves It!,"Originally I wanted to buy another type of diaper pail, one that uses regular bags. I recieved the Genie as a gift and I'm so glad I did. What makes the Genie different is the bags. They are scented andd thicker then normal bags to contain the odors. The only change I would make is to have the whole system a little larger, but it does hold about a weeks worth of diapers. I find it simple to use several times a day and easy to refill about every three weeks. The refills usually cost on average $4.50. I have never used any other diaper system, and will recommend the Genie to others. In facT, I have already given one as a gift."
2,forget it,"Okay - the positive is that the customer service is great. My first one was broken and they immed. sent me a new one.Bad news is the product isn't worth it. The cutter doesn't really work and I hated changing it so much that I only used it for poop diapers. Well after 5 months it stunk anyway. I say use those little blue powdery diaper bags you can get a Walmart, BabiesRUs or wherever. This is a piece of trash."
1,What a waste,"The diaper genie stinks, literally. There is nothing new or improved about it, it's as bad as the original. The only ways to prevent this thing from stinking up your house is to only put wet diapers in it and take the poopy diapers into an outdoor trash can, invest in a case-load of Ozium because you'll have to spray it every time you open the pail to put in another diaper, or tie each diaper in a plastic grocery bag BEFORE you put it into the diaper genie. Plus you have to buy the 'special' bags for it that don't work either.Don't waste your time or money on this thing."
1,Not very improved!,"I got the diaper genie because my friend had one and really liked it. The new and improved model that I purchased would not cut the plastic! We would push the button and turn and sometimes it would not pop up or pop up too soon! It was a pain. I borrowed her ""old model"" diaper genie to get me through until I purchased a Diaper Champ---which is way better than both models and cheaper because I don't have to buy the expensive refills!!!"
3,Not bad,The overall function of the daiper pail is awesome. It contains the smell extremly well. However the refill process is still quite complicated. I also find that it is very noisy so we save nightime diapers until morning as to not wake the baby.
4,No smell and easy to use!,"This diaper genie is great. It is easy to use, and there is no smell in my son's small nursery. The refills last longer than I thought they would and are relitivly inexpensive. I only gave this 4 stars because sometimes the blade on the cutter doesn't cut the bag all the way, but this is a minor thing. Overall, I'm glad we have it!"
1,yuck - do not buy,I have a two year old son and I used the diaper genie and I could not get the smell to go away even after I cleaned it. I bought the new and Improved (haha! that is a joke) one and it has the same problem. The smell is absorbed by the plastic and there is no cleaner that I found and no about of soaking that can get the smell out.
1,I WANT TO DROP KICK THIS STUPID THING,"The Diaper Genie is the worst piece of crap I have ever used. When it works it is fine, but the stupid inner funnel ring has broken and had to be replaced 3 times already. The people at Playtex were very nice about replacing it, but come on! Do you know how many diapers a baby goes through between the time this thing breaks and the time a replacement part arrives? We didn't even do anything to hurt the ring, sometimes if you just open the unit too roughly it will shear the edges and then it won't fit back in the top. We have given up and bought a diaper champ."
2,playtex diaper genie twist away pail system,i'm not as impressed with this product as i am the genie 2. this twist away pail system only holds 30 diapers whereas the genie 2 holds many more. it's also difficult to twist when it gets nearly full and the cutting mechanism never works and i end up having to cut the bag from the inside with a sissors. i will likely purchase another system soon when my child starts to eat solids.
1,What a waste..never worked right,"The diaper genie was such a waste of money...luckily I was able to return it to the store. The diapers never twisted into an individual sack, just went into one big sack at the bottom. I never knew if it was actual twisting, always had to check after each couple of twists, then usually twist again. Don't waste your money..."
1,Boring!,"If you love to watch footage of hockey players showing off their kitchens, sportscars, and hobbies, you'll flip you wig for this DVD. However, if you want to see actual hockey, look elsewhere--it ain't here. The previous ""NHL All-Access"" DVD, released back in 2001, was a fun look behind the scenes of the game, from the expansion draft to the broadcasting booth, spotlighting historic games such as Patrick Roy's career wins record and Wayne Gretzky's final game. This disc (save for the final five minutes, centering around the Stanley Cup) is a snoozefest."
2,"Why not title this ""You need Jesus""?","This book is a deviously disguised religious tract, advertised to sell as an ""information-packed, thoroughly researched manual"" by a medical doctor on the very real dangers of crystal meth, but in truth it is an attempt to convert the reader to fundamentalist Christianity. I fail to see how teaching intelligent design in our schools leads to drug abuse, and I remain unconvinced that people turn to drugs because they don't have Jesus in their lives. I wasted my money on a piece of propaganda. Surely there are other books that provide accurate information without discrediting my religion under the guise of education."
3,crystal meth they call it ice,was sent to my son in jail he said it was a good book but not as good as another he had read where the writer had been through it and knows first hand the problems it causes
1,A Misleading Book on Crystal Meth,"I was very disappointed in this book because it starts out factual then turns into a sermon from the pulpits. Chapters 1-8 gives great information on how Meth affects the Brain. Then the book is turned into a venue to spread God's message with scripture quotations. The last two chapters go even further to tell us her opinions on Intelligent Design in Public Schools and Medical Marijuana. The author was good at capturing my attention on the subject of Meth, but then I felt deceived by her craftiness in leading me to her own personal belief system and opinions."
2,"The first few chapters were good, she should have stopped there.","The first few chapters detailing how meth affects the brain of users, including how moods are effected were great. After that there's a bible reference on nearly every page. Way too religious and non-factual for my liking."
1,Uses meth for another agenda!,"While researching material on Methamphetamine and the damage it is causing our country I came upon this book. At first glance I was very impressed with the medical information provided on how meth use affects the body. The photos are high quality and her research is compelling.However, I was greatly disappointed upon further examination of using this forum to further a Christian Fundamentalist belief system. For instance, the appendix includes the, Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula. This might come across to readers to have ulterior motives for this book.The resource section does not include AA. I have been in recovery for 18 years and practicing the Twelve Steps has provided a frame work in recovery for many addictions. Please pay attention to Step Three: Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as WE UNDERSTOOD HIM!"
2,Didn't work for my application.,"Every time it rains on my Christmas lights the GFI in my garage trips, and my FIOS internet and T.V. go out. I thought I could plug my lights into this, so only the lights go out. It did not work for me."
4,Good movie,"It's a (sigh) good movie but about 30 minutes too long. Or is it forty? I like the music, choreography & action in it."
3,I'm biased,"I love outkast since day one. I liked the fact they added some of their previous songs to the soundtracks. Some of my favs.The crappiness of this movie features Macy Gray. What the hell!! I could have done without her in this movie, especially singing. I like her voice for acting but not so much singing, it's ridiculous. the first 25 minutes or so I was having problems getting over some of the other ridiculous things going in the movie. like the rapping in 1940's Georgia. alrighty then!! also Faizon Love's acting and that voice were the pits. Moving on!!The best parts were the shoot outs. And the scene on the dirt road with Cicely Tyson and the bible she gave to Big Boi's character.It's something to watch to get you through the day or nite."
2,An extended hip hop video,"I think everyone can agree that visually Idlewild hit all the right points. It's the bad acting and predicable plot that has you cringing in your seat. I understand wanting to do something different with the rap-they were trying to reach their target audience, but it's so jarringly out of place that you can't quite forgive them for it. The shootout scenes are the best part of the film, but overall the film doesn't have that much to say. Did I mention that the acting is bad???"
4,Precival Percival !!!,"From the jump I will say that i LOVED Andre's Character Percival...He made him so real to the point where I really do believe there's a Percival out there..(Hopefully with another name) BUT the point is I really did like this movie..Some parts were veryyyyy distracting and unNEEDED..Like the part where Andre was singing with all the CLOCKS..*SILENCE* ..waste...and the rooster constantly talking to BIG BOI..*SILENCE*...and some of the music scenes were way too long..and it bothered me that this movie was suppose to be in the 1950's or 60's I believe, But Big Boi was rapping about stuff TODAY !!..Overall I would still recommend this movie because I did like it, just minor stuff urked me...it's a really good movie though VERY GOOD !"
3,For blacks only,"A musical set in the Prohibition-era American South-- no way!This is by far the worst movie I have seen since 'Better Luck Tomorrow' three years ago. I have a scholarly explanation to support my reasons, but was not allowed to have it accepted. Censorship is still alive and well in this country.Today I went to see a movie I expected to showcase some jazz as it was touted as being a musical about the probition period. It was anything but jazz. About a piano-playing mortician who hauled around bootleg liquor in shiny wood caskets and Ace who dressed in overalls. All of their meetings were in that club where the dancing was amateurish and the music bad. There was language we don't normally hear and some nudity in the acts. It was so upsetting that I had to get up and leave."
2,Out of place and time,"In the speakeasy of the prohibition era both jazzand blues got their start. Musically rap and hip hopcame much later: break dancing is also a later result.To be fair the music and plot are pretty good,but King Arthur doing rock and roll is as likely as30's blacks doing rap. Historically it shames the heritageof jazz."
2,"5 stars for ambition, but This movie sucks...................","The Technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where. What's the point? 3000 is creepy as usual and Big Boi's acting is horrible when he's paired against Terrence Howard. They only got 1000 screens nationwide for this movie but it doesn't matter. 3000 screens or 1000 screens, the bottom line is that This movie sucks."
1,Thriller or Comedy?,"OMIFG! This was one of THE worst movies ever made! Me and my cousin watched it last night, and were crackinig up, the script is hilarious! Who actually talks like that?! We watched it for a half hour only because we wanted to see if it would get any better, uhhh...sadly, no. We watched ""American Beauty"" instead *brilliant.* I really loved James Marsden in ""Gossip""-which was an excellent movie, but the only thing 'disturbing' about this was the writing. Like James, l also liked his weird friend in ""Wasted"" but not at all in this. I love Katie Holmes, but even she couldn't help this project, talk about a WASTE OF FILM MONEY AND TIME!"
3,suspense filled & a great cast,"When I started to watch I glued to the telly, my brother is always leaving the super glue around."
1,Disturbingly bad.,"James Marsden is the new teen in school who discovers there's some mind-altering experiments going on, turning rebellious students into upstanding citizens. With a premise that MIGHT have made an okay satire, this one plays as a straight suspense flick, and it's one boring, visually dull mess. Flat acting from Marsden and Katie Holmes doesn't help matters much. Silly without being the slightest bit of fun, which is quite an accomplishment. Of the many post-Scream thrillers out there, this is probably the worst."
2,"Had Potential, But At Least We Get Katie Holmes","This teen thriller could of been something interesting. I've heard rumors that it was butchered in the editing room and studio people toyed with it. I believe it. It seems like there was more there than the final product we got to see. James Marsden stars as a kid who's family moves to Cradle Bay. He soon realizes the good students at school, called the Blue Ribbons, are not what they seem. Think of it as ""The Stepford Students"". The cast is all pretty decent, especially Nick Stahl. James Marsden is too much of a jock to feel that he would be much of an outsider. It's always nice to see Bill Sadler too. But, if all else fails, there's Katie Holmes. Sweet, lovely, adorable Katie. Bestill my beating heart. Sorry. Where was I?. This is an okay film that doesn't exactly make you think you wasted your time. It could of been so much better. There was so much promise to it."
2,A laughing stock.,"Disturbing Behavior is pretty much awful. The plot has promise, but is brought down by downright horrible acting (most notably from Katie Holmes, who provides nothing more than something to look at in this film), and pitiful dialogue.The one saving grace of the movie is Nick Stahl who plays Gavin. He portrays two different roles very well, switching from one to the other halfway through the film. Other than his performance, everything else about Disturbing Behavior is laughable. Need I even mention the ending, which is so dull it makes Al Gore seem like Jim Carrey. This film might please teenagers eager to catch a flick about other teenagers, and maybe catch a glimpse of partial nudity.But I would not recommend this film to anybody else."
4,Review,"This is a good movie, I really enjoyed the concept. There have been alot of ""mind control"" movies in the past, but this one was directed by a competent director. David Nutter is known for his brillant work on The X Files, and he has been able to successfully bring his special blend of wit and drama to the big screen with Disturbing Behavior. And Katie Holmes is hot."
3,Quite 'Disturbing',"William Sadler plays the janitor, not Dan Zudovic. The 'professional' review was wrong. I didn't know that Carly Pope was in this movie, interesting... ""Disturbing Behavior"" definitely has its flaws but it's still entertaining. High school students are paranoid about the preppy kids who seem to be out of place. Are they aliens? Is somebody controlling them? Well, it's up to James Marsden and Katie Holmes to save the world! Or town. The movie has an X-Files touch to it since it was directed by David Nutter (a director for the show). Too bad Mulder and Scully didn't come down to teach these kids a lesson. It had potential that never delivered, but it was entertaining."
3,Katie was awesome in this!!,I think this movie was a little odd and kind of stupid. It had a good plot but the way it was presented was dumb. Katie Holmes was the only good thing about this flick. She is such an awesome actress and she earned all the three stars that i gave by herself! I LOVE KATIE!
2,Slightly disturbing,"After seeing the trailer for Disturbing Behavior, I was really looking forward to seeing it. Even though I work in a movie theater and had the advantage of seeing it for free, I was disturbed and disappointed by this so-called horror film. Despite the fact that the acting was good, and it starred the very easy-on-the-eyes Katie Holmes, I thought this 80-minute opus left a lot to be desired. There were a few parts where I wondered what was going to happen, but I think the filmmakers could have done a lot more with the intriguing story line. If you're a fan of Katie Holmes, or cheesy horror movies, then go rent it. Otherwise, stick to the Scream franchise."
3,Average Teeny Bopper Flick.,"I'm only 18, so who am I to call something a teeny bopper flick?... Oh, well. Disturbing Behavior is a sort of Clockwork Orange-y movie about a group of kids in high school that are nothing less than perfect. It's kind of dull, and you never really find out why they're doing this to these kids, but the colors in the movie are bright as hell and should grab your attention. It's less than an hour and a half long so it shouldn't be too hard to get through if you're totally not enjoying it. Katie Holmes was a very VERY nice touch; that dance she does in the truck just makes you say, ""Hey."" Not exactly the worse of the teen horror flick craze, but it's definetely not the best. Try renting it first just to be on the safe side, even if you are nuts about Katie Holmes like I am."
4,Neat,"This isn't as scary as Scream, Scream 2, or IKWYDLS, okay it wasn't scary at all. But it was insanly clever. It also had good acting and some suspence. This is a movie for Fans of the X files and scream."
2,There is nothing scary about this movie.,"This movie was okay. That's it, no better no worse. I've seen better and I've seen worse. This movie was just blah. There is nothing scary about this movie. It's more like a really good tv movie of the week."
2,It was a little boring,The movie was really boring and not scarry at all. I was expecting a scarrier movie than what I really saw. The plot was pretty cool but a little boring.
5,Absolutely Purrfect Movie,Great movie. It has wonderful actors/actresses and a marvelously original plot.I love it!!!
3,"A Clever, modern, sci-fi, horror...","Jimmy Marsden and Katie Holmes make this a pretty good movie with a cool plot. The story about students that turn perfect overnight by an operation. With Jimmy Marsden, Katie Holmes, and Nick Stahl"
1,"awful, and overdone","the plot on this film was very bad. the acting, well nothing to be desired. it was just another one of those trendy ""horror"" films that have all the fav. teen actors in them."
2,Unoriginal and dull overall.,"I wasn't impressed with Disturbing Behavior. It held my interest (to a degree) for just about an hour, but after that my attention faded almost completely. This film was unoriginal and the plot was weak and quite vague. I can't say that the acting was poor, it was okay. This movie wasn't completely bad, but it was below average though. The most impressive thing about Disturbing Behavior was the opening scene with the night sky. Skip this one."
1,Disturbingly Bad,This movie is terrible. Do NOT buy or rent this drivel. I can't even call it predicable. It is so incoherent and the whole thing seems to be made up on the spot. All characters are cardboard cut-outs and stereotyped (especially the adults and ESPECIALLY the parents).James Marsden is the worst actor I've ever seen. He emotes absolutely nothing in his role and is waaaaaaaaay to old for the character. I laughed out loud in a scene when his father asks him if he is worried about his first day at school. FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL??????!? This guy is a quarter of a century years old!!!Such a boring film with no directorial flourishes or worthwhile moments or even any sense. Why this movie was made I'll never know even if I live to be a 1000. Never watch this for any reason.The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.85:1.
4,Better than people give it credit for.,"I thought that this movie was a lot better than people have been saying. My friends and I are huge horror movie fans and went in looking for a good movie and that's exactly what we got. I thought that it had pretty good casting, great atmosphere, and I for one liked the ending a lot."
2,"Good start, terrible ending.","Risen from the Dead of 1998 Direct to DVD hell the cast of Katie Holmes, Nick Stahl, Steve Railsback, Bruce Greenwood and William Sadler make an entrance here in this bit part movie that copies ""The Faculty"" without trying to be very different - drug themes, school themes, monster themes, bullies as football players, it is all the same. NO CGI or special effects, this is acting driven... but off the cliff, its sudden appearance in 1998 as a shelf space filler does not do it any more credit now. Watch another film with these fine actors in it, certainly the ""The Faculty"" instead, or even William Sadler in ""Demon Knight""."
4,Great Teen Thriller!,"James Marsden is the new kid in a town called Cradle Bay which is not what it seems...He begins to suspect something weird and strange is going on between the Cradle Bay Teens.There are no drunk drivers,everyone is a straight A student.They are all into bake sales[aaahhhhhh! ],hanging out at yougurt shopees[aaahhhh!] and listening to Olivia Newton John[AAAAAAAAAHHHHH! ].He and a gang of outsiders come together to stop all the madness! That is before his parents put him down for treatment....After directing all those X Files episodes some of the scary magic should rub off onto this movie and it certainly does.James Marsden is a stand out performance in this movie,thin story line but hey it is a teen [sort of] movie.Great DVD extras including theatrical trailer,several deleted scenes,an alternate ending,directors commentary and a music video.Way cool movie too.4 out of 5"
3,one of the better ones,I would say that this is one of the better horror movies of the 90's but not the best. I would suggests watching this movie to anyone who likes horror
5,Great Movie,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's really well done without the cheesiness of today's horror movies. There's actually some reality to Disturbing Behavior. Love the movie soundtrack too! This movie is in my top 5.
1,Not Worth Watching !,"Predictable: Almost a copy of an Outer Limits EpisodeScarey: NOT !Racey: They have to do something to keep people watching, so they threw in sex and nudity.What I would have preferred to be doing: Digging lint out of my bellybutton.CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED !"
5,"quite ""disturbing""","this movie is different from the horror movies i watch, but in a good way. i had to get this dvd because i loved it as a kid. superb acting & a great plot. plus it has everything you could want in a teen horror flick. i feel this movie is totally underrated. thats ""bad wrong wrong bad"""
3,"Weird film, had potential","This movie started out strong, but it eventually sputtered out. Good acting helped this film, because at least the actors did a convincing job in their roles, so at least that compensated somewhat for the bad writing. Between the acting and writing, I have to give this movie 3 stars. I only wish the story and writing had been better thought out, I found implants in the eyes a bit hard to buy, wouldn't implants in the back of the head or whatever have been a better idea? Oh well."
2,"Disturbing Behavior, just plain disturbing...","I was excited to hear about the next episode in the Stepford Wives tradition. But, the 1970's movie was more interesting, and more scary than this flick. The story was not so good, the psych hospital looked like a representation from the 1950's, and if it had a scary moment, I missed it. I was really disappointed with this film."
2,I had better expectations...,"My friends had recommended this film to me and we rented it and watched it the other night. It was completly and utterly dumb. The acting wasn't great, and the characters were too dumb to care about. It's basically just a bad version of a much better movie of this sort, ""The Faculty"". If you want to see a movie about a bunch of brain washed teens, rent ""The Faculty"" instead. Skip this one. The two good things about it were the musical score, and the last few minutes of the movie, which were creepy."
1,It doesn't even deserve that one star.,"This is easily one of the most godawful piles of swill ever commited to film. I mean, where do they come up with this stuff? Plot holes you could drive a mack truck through, really bad acting (That's an understatement), and a really terrible ending all combine to make this the movie that you should all miss. I didn't even pay to see it in the theatre, and I STILL felt ripped off- I can never have those two hours of my life back. Spare yourself the exposure to this drivel and buy something that's worth your hard earned money."
2,Weak laugh inducing effort,"This film is a strange attempt that rips off too many decent horror films to count. Katie Holmes can't be faulted for this turkey, she tries her best. The premise is weak, and the horror is virtually nonexistent. I think maybe it would play out better for a young audience however, all others stay away. The janitor is extremely amusing."
1,There's a reason it's bad.,"Contrary to what some people may say, the reason this movie's bad is simply because it's dumber than a doorbell, is extremely dull, and features far better ideas than it deserves. For a better film of this plot, go to the original Stepford Wives. For a better young-adult oriented horror film, go with Dean Koontz's Phantoms."
4,"A very good movie overall, but it could have been better.","I think this movie was probably meant to be creepy and thought-provoking, and it succeeded in both those areas, but it definitely was not a horror movie. James Marsden and Katie Holmes did a wonderful job of acting in this movie. Now that I've seen the scenes that were deleted from the movie, I think that probably a little too much was deleted. Also, the movie's ending sort of left me hanging on a few issues, but other than that I thought the movie was very good. This one is worth buying on DVD."
1,"Mainstreet science movie, not horror movie!","I knew already from the beginning that this movie isn't going to be a good one. The beginning looked like a comet-searching science tv-show and you couldn't even see the actors' names! And what did Katie Holmes there? Did she have a some kind of main role? NO!!! She was there only to make the movie a bit more beautiful. I have seen thousands of movies like this. This is an old movie clichee. I have seen many more bad movies which end like this one. WHETHER YOU'D LIKE KATIE HOLMES (as I do), DON'T RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE, please."
3,Gullivers Travels DVD,This was an Ok movie. Ted Danson did a marginal job as Gulliver but more often than not came off as a if he was spaced out. Worth a look but not nearly as well done as Tin Man.
4,Great!,"The DVD was loose in the case when I got it, so I was a bit scared it would be scratched, but it survived! I can't believe I it was in such good quality to find such a rare find!I would recommend in the future."
2,A Sign of What Could Have Been,"I had had this DVD of Gullivers Travels for a couple of years and finally got around to watching it and I was really, really disappointed. Why on Earth did they have two plots running thru it . A couldn't tell what part of the story I was watching half of the time. And I'm really not a stupid man. It was a great beautiful production. Wonderful cast. I have seen films that weren;t as half richly produced as this one. But the story kept going 'in & out' of realty & fantasy too much. I had to go back to scenes to 'try to understand the damn thing. Ted Danson was a perfect Choice to play Gullever, but it should have been played straight as the original ""Gullivers Travels"" was written by Jonathen Swift wrote it. I had seen the new Jack Black version and that was a disaster too, Give me the old cartoon version compared to these two lousy versions. Sincerly Bob ""Ziggy"" Anderson"
2,Poorly Done DVD,"The image on this DVD has been cropped to produce an artificial widescreen image. It was originally shown in full screen. It's completely possible that the director didn't even authorize this change. The composition of the scenes is [messed] up by this, as tops of heads push the top black bar throughout. Also, there is no feature to watch the movie from beginning to end. The DVD producers were so incompetent that they put a break in between the first part and second instead of combining them. Oh, and they also make you sit through opening credits on the second part. How stupid is that? How about actually using the space which DVD affords you and put the whole thing as 1 movie, instead of part 1 and part 2? The only reason it was split into two was because it was shown on two different nights. But it is *one* movie. There is a nice ""making of"", but for all the reasons I've listed, I can't recommend this DVD. Stick with the video."
4,Gulliver's Travels,"Everything about the product has been exceptional - delivery, packaging, everything - but the DVD itself wasn't the cleanest. Once cleaned, however, it has played over and over again perfectly. Very satisfied."
4,excellent family movie,"This is a wonderful movie, well produced with a great cast. Its a long movie but one where the whole family can watch and enjoy. There is a lot of satire in the movie, some very good philosophical insights. Highly recommended."
3,Its not right!,Any reader of a Jonathan Swift story would know that the intent in his book is by no means represented in this movie. Gulliver is never sent to an assylumn in the book and never reconcyles with his family at the end because in the book he cant stand any humans whatsoever after he leaves the Houyhnhnms! Not to mention all of the nit-picky things that deviate from the original story line. I do admit however that I did enjoy the movie but Swift is turning in his grave!
5,Wonderful Book,"My son loves the Farmyard Tales so its great to have them all in one book. The only disadvantage is that he wants me to read the whole thing! Which is why the CD is so good. It teaches him to listen and to concentrate on going through the book himself. A good quality book, I like the fact that it comes with a ribbon bookmark too."
1,poorly realized version of a potentially interesting story,"i bought this book based on the high ratings here on amazon and was really disappointed...the plot has holes so big you could drive a dog-team through them...the main characters are not particularly likeable, much less believable. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss."
1,Gordy ripped off Sugar Bunny!!!,I have a pig at home named Sugar Bunny. He walks and talks and has his own buisness. He walks around in a suit all day giving stock quotes. I want some money from this movie! GIVE ME MONEY!!!
2,He's no 'Babe',"Gordy (voiced by Justin Garms) is a live-action movie about talking animals - with its emphasis on porkers - who must endure the cruel whims of man. When Gordy is stolen by an aspiring country singer named Jinnie Sue MaCallister (KristyYoung), his life changes for the better; that is, if you'd rather go to beer-swilling hoedown yodeling concerts than be turned into a BLT. Tough call.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Corny,"This was a predictable and corny kids movie, and for that it just eeeked out the third star, but maybe two and a half would be a better ranking.In any case, it's not in my ""to own"" list, but if you have young kids, they'll probably be entertained at least once watching it."
4,Gordy not Babe,"Gordy was a copy of Babe, which came first??? Well its like Babe theres a talking pig and some family gets stuck up north. i own it but 4got what happens since i just relized i had it. Its got these people and (i dunnt wanna spoil it..............."
1,Not suitable for children.,"The story is vapid, the characters cartoonish cliches. The production values are seamless Disney. The humor is not funny.The only bright spot is Kristy Young, who is a very talented young girl. However, her catchy country tune about your ""butt check"" and ""fly zip"" as you look for love on the dance floor is completely inappropriate for a children's movie, let alone for a 12 year old girl to be singing.The frosting on the cake is the audio cameo by our thankfully ex-President Clinton and his simpering wife. The movie is an insult to the intelligence of American children and to the State of Arkansas."
3,"Good product, but not very solid","This is a good value for money. Not a particularly solid piece of furniture (different length of legs - I had to adjust with additional pads once assembled). It was rather simple for assembly, though. The surface is good, but not excellent - tiny bumps and unevenness. If you have other pieces from the same product line, this makes a lot more sense in decorating your home. By itself it's not worth it."
2,"cheap table, it will not be recommended","Chrome ring not in the socket, table surface and lags not polished. side panel and legs are not even, will not buy from this manufacture again"
2,Hall table,"We never were able to receive this without damage in shipping.So I have no review, everytime we tried to get a replacement, it would show up with damage. We gave up. it looked like it would have been a beautiful table. We had no luck with shipping, if the package were more secure we would have had no problem, poor quality in packing."
5,Perfect sturdy little table,"Purchased for my bedroom as a computer table- hold a laptop and small printer. Very sturdy, pretty, dark brown with reddish undertones. Easy to assemble. Great at the price"
2,Poor Quality,First table I received was scratched and I had to get it replaced.The 2nd one that came the leg fell off. Not happy at all.
3,Not as good as Winsome's other products,"It was easy to put together, that's the positive thing, and it's functional without being too wobbly. It's a compact narrow design which is perfect for smaller rooms and walkways.Cons are that these are very generic slabs of pine wood without any elegance to it with moldings or decorative trim. This is unlike Winsome's computer desk which is so much higher quality. Also, it's black paint on the wood which I assume is used rather than stain because the quality of wood is quite low. Also, there were four pieces of chrome ""spools"" you see in the corners of the image - these are supposed to be wedged in there when you assemble the legs. Only probem is, the offset isn't quite as tight as it should be so two of these were loose fitting. I will have to glue them in or something.Overall, dissappointing considering the price paid. Would like to see this go for no more than 50 smackers and it would be rated much higher."
1,"Cracked top, returned",Very cheaply made. Packing was not damaged but the table top had a big crack through most of it. Returned
2,looks cheap,Table looks like pine painted black. I thought espresso was dark brown -- it's pitch black. Purchased for spot in reception area -- looks awful.
2,Poor Quality,"Product shipped as expected. Unfortunately, when I opened the package there were several knicks in the wood. The table was poorly put together, as the underside/skirt wasn't screwed in tight and didn't fit appropriately. The top had a large crack in the seam of the wood, which is very visible and wasn't even filled with color. I ordered the espresso, but I received a black table. This just was not what I was expecting, I'm disappointed."
4,Good value for money,The package was delivered as expected. The color of the table is exactly what I had hoped for. It matches the rest of our furniture! The quality of the table is also very good.
2,Had gouge marks & legs broke when screwing it together,"Not very good quality but figure you get what you pay for. The finish on top is uneven, there are gouge marks on the underside that go right up to the edge and while putting in the screws two of the particle board legs splintered. We braced the legs to keep them on and put the gouge marks to the back. It seemed to be the best for the budget I have & was needed in a hurry so I did not even try to return or replace."
3,All levels the same?,"All the levels resemble the last level with some slight variations, always different objectives, I bought this for my 4 year old who LOVES spider man, and can play the games on the PS2, but for some reason, hes just not into this game as much as I anticipated."
5,Wonderful,"What a lovely book. Sure, it has cute pictures of cats and funny observations of catly ways. But it also has thoughtful--and thought-provoking--suggestions on how we may draw inspiration and instruction from the way our cat friends live.Joanna Sandsmark writes in a quiet, gentle, yet confident tone. I look forward to reading this talented writer's newest book, ""The Wisdom of Yo Meow Ma."""
5,Complete Package if you're serious about the staffing crisis.,"This book presents it all in various chapters examining the crisis in human services. It's not just about the money anymore and these authors cover all the bases. From advertising and recruitment to how to improve longevity - it's all in this book and it's based on RESEARCH!This book is a must read for everyone in Human Services and should be on the list for aging BabyBoomers - not only isn't there going to be any Social Security for us, there won't be anyone to work in the nursing homes and retirement centers either!Highly recommend this book!"
4,"Solid writing, interesting reading","This fast moving tale focuses on an environmental services company which provides services to the U.S. water supply. Sarge, a chemist and terrorist, has targeted the company for a heinous plan to corrupt the water supply of the nation. Kelsey Cooke, on the other hand, is the Chief Operating Officer and has become concerned with the number of accidents recently in the company. A well-woven story it is an excellent study of human nature at its best and worst as Sarge takes advantage of corporate culture, internal politics, and human desires to gain access to the company. At the same time, the internal politics and corporate culture interfere with Kelsey's investigation. Will she be able to find out about Sarge's activities before the water system is compromised? Will one of Sarge's unwitting accomplices figure it out and create a problem for him? Written in a smooth easy-reading style Labs of Deception keeps the reader interested from beginning to end."
4,Doing Nothing Says Something,"This first-time effort by a physician-novelist is an auspicious beginning. It is a chronology of a young man as he proceeds through four years of medical school and four more years of post-graduate training in Internal Medicine. The hectic, often chaotic, life these eight years encompass is described in vivid (some might think too vivid) detail and with a mixture of dark and light humor, sex and pathos. Many interesting characters, probably drawn from real-life, pop in and out of the pages, which can be read briskly with a chuckle and occasionally a tear. The book begins in a cynical tone and ends with a strong sense of hope and humanism. This transformation faithfully reproduces the actual experience of physicians-to-be and those moving thru the often-grueling life of post-graduate training. Altogether, I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable book. I look forward to the next one."
3,Give peace a chance,"Violent or non, organized or not, protesters had one thing in common - a desire to end the war in Vietnam. An informative look at the groups, individuals, and events rocking the end of the 60's and early 70's until the conflict ended. The government and other officials are, of course, the bad guys, while the protesters are idealistic and self-sacrificing. A very readable text, enough for reports. Black and white photos, bibliography, and index are included."
4,Works - but has a couple of negatives,"Firstly, this cap works as advertised.You can get a good white balance and keep your lens protected when not in use.BUT...The 2 'buttons' that you press to place or remove the cap catch on things, especially when you put your camera in your bag. I often find the cap just stays in the bag when I pull the camera out without me knowing. So I have to be a little more careful now instead of just pulling my camera out to take a quick photo.Also, I thought I could just use the cap, take a picture of the subject like the real picture, then use that photo as the white-balance source image. But NO... You need to remember that if you do this, that any subject item that is colored will affect the white balance. What you have to do is take a direct picture of all the light sources, possibly even from the subjects perspective.I still count this as a useful tool though that will quickly get past most white-balance issues."
3,"Appears to work as claimed, but one big weakness...","I just bought the ExpoCap and used it once, and it seems to function as claimed. However, it has one shortcoming that it may share with the entire ExpoDisc and ExpoCap lines: No protective case.The ExpoCap works much like a filter, over the lens; and every filter I have bought came in a durable case in which it is stored in the camera bag, protecting it from dirt and damage, notably scratching, throughout its life. The ExpoCap does not. Since it must be used and then put away, possibly frequently, it's handiest stored in a camera bag or even temporarily in a handy pocket; however, such frequent handling and storage invites scratching and other damage. Therefore, a snug case sturdy enough to protect it when it's not on the lens is imperative and should be a part of the product."
3,"""Just Look, What A Mess You've Made Of My Linen!""...","HUSH has all the right ingredients for a terrific thriller. There's the beautiful, young victim (Gwyneth Paltrow), her idiot, clueless husband (Jonathon Schaech), and his insane, psychotic mum (Jessica Lange). Unfortunately, things get a bit too bogged down in the wimpy, soppy, pouty-faced Gwyneth vs. Lange (doing her best southern-fried maniac) snit. I kept waiting for things to spiral out of control, or at least for a murder or two, only to see the story slooowly grind along, up until the ""Gotcha!"" climax. It was OK, but I can't imagine watching it again..."
2,Quiet please!,"Hush? There was really no need to call for quiet during the first hour of this grandiose, but rather slow thriller.....the distinct lack of action and overdeliberate development of the characters produced a sufficiently soporific effect to ensure silence. The success of movies of this ""evil matriarch"" ilk seems to depend upon evoking a feeling of hatred for the mother figure and, eventually, the urge to strangle Jessica Lange is almost irrepressible, but it all takes too long to happen. So, a beautifully shot film with a luxurious country estate backdrop and a top draw cast (Nina Foch is delightful as the down-to-earth paternal grandmother), but this ground has been covered with more malice and a smaller budget by movies like ""The Stepmother"" (Diane Ladd)."
2,Movie Condition,Conditon was used but not exceptable. Only paid $2.99. DVD is scratched and skips when played.Not worth my time or gas to have it returned for refund.
3,Great Campy Fun,"In the tradition of ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" and ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,"" comes another guilty pleasure that is just pure B movie camp. It's a hell of a lot of fun too. The film's got problems (I hear it was originally close to 3 hours and a lot of footage was cut) and a commentary or some deleted scenes would have been a great addition to this disc. As it is, it's worth buying, but I would suggest renting it first, because it's not for all tastes."
4,The Mother-In-Law From Hell!,This was a great thriller about a jealous mother-in-law that believes she's losing her son to his new wife. So she begins terrorizing her so they will move back in with her on her farm. But the woman begins to uncover dark family secrets resulting in more harassment from the mother-in-law. Things continue to escalate to the point of violence and madness between the two. You should definatly see this heart-pounding thriller!
5,So Sad This Didn't Get 5 Stars Across The Board,Jessica Lange did an Outstanding Job as the Sinister Mother - They couldn't have got a better performance from anyone - The low prices listed for a Used DVD make this a remarkable Value - Buy it - You won't be disappointed
2,Let Down,"this movie was critically bashed, and thought i wouldn't like. i was suprised to fine it kind of entertaining until the ending which totally ruined any suspense that was building up. the ending is really bad, and dissapointing to what COULD have a pretty good thriller. the only thing that makes it really watchable was probably Lange and Paltrow. and the guy who played the husband of Gwyneth was totally unbelievable as a farm boy. he wasn't the type. and plus he was a bad actor. rent before you buy"
3,No one leaves Martha!,"I liked the film for it's intense conclution that just had me so anxious it wasn't funny...but there are some distracting elements, the main one being that everyone except Gwenyth's charactor seems to be really stupid. I mean, the fact that no one catches on that Jessica Lange is freaking insane is poposterous. I love my mother, but I can even attest to times when she's crazy, never this crazy thank god, but this guy thinks his mother is a saint when clearly she has way to many screws loose. So heres my word of advise. Watch it at least once, it's worth that for the final confrontation (and the baby's delivery which is just heartwrenching) and then decide for yourself how you feel. I was just so frustrated half the time that no one saw what was so obvious that it took away from the real terror of the film. Jessica Lange plays a great psycho and Gwenyth does good as the distraught wife of a mommies-boy."
2,Predictable,"A predictable narrative and soap-opera-quality encouneters dominate this drama of familial jealousy and intrigue. The one feature that might have rescued it would have been the performances of the stars (the innocent-looking Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange) but this isn't so, and Lange overacts as the scheming matriarch."
5,A Must Have!,"This movie has a great story line to it. When I watched it I was glued to the TV. If you like surprises, trust me you'll like this. Whenever there's something scary on the screen I either hide under a blanket or run out of the room, same if I think somethings about to happen. Anyways, I hid a whole lot during this movie, and yet was just so great to watch, and I loved it."
3,hush,"This movie was pretty good, but the end was quite predictable. Not the sort of ending you're looking for in a thriller. Jessica Lange was marvelous and scary."
3,3 is good,"I didn't really like the film as much as I thought I would. Since part of the movie was filmed near my hometown(Culpeper, Va), I was excited to see it and got let down. The Plot needs work. My 3 stars go to Jessica Lange. One of the sexiest females on Earth."
3,What Happened?,"HUSH is a diaster! What happened that made this film so terrible? Gwyneth Paltrow is my favorite actress and she has public said that she has NEVER seen the finished product because she is so embarrassed by it. She, herself, knows it is a terrible film. Originally entitled 'Kilronan,' this film must of needed some revisions because in the film some scenes has Gwyneth wearing a wig. Most likely, after filming Sliding Doors, where Gwyneth chops off her hair, she was called back to reshoot many of the scenes. The film kept my attention, but yet some scenes did not run smoothly and some parts of the film were plain ridiculous! Only reason the film is getting 3 stars is because I enjoyed Gwyneth!"
2,A Wannabe that Never Makes It There,"This movie is a wannabe. It wants to be a shocking, spine-tingling thriller...instead it stops at just plain shocking -- how could Gwynnie and Jessie make such a horrid movie together!!??The plot could've been well-done, but it goes in a completely unbelievable direction before the first act ends. The beginning is o.k., the middle flounders terribly and the end is just sheer torture. What were these people thinking?After seeing it on HBO, I was so glad I never spent money to see it. I *almost* rented in on Pay-Per-View and before that I *really almost* saw it in the theater. I'm so glad I saved that seven bucks!!And it's a shame because the trailers for this film made it look *so* good. If you're in the mood for a thriller with a crazy old bat trying to rub out somebody who lives with 'er, see ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""! Don't bother with this one!"
1,Embarrassing for Lange,Is this what a quality actress has come to? It is unfathomable that Lange would accept such a role. Where are the producers and directors who might supply a a script worthy of her talent. Boring film. How in in the world did the actor who portrays Lange's son get this part? Paltrow is Paltrow - the same in every role. Her powerful parents stole the oscar from Blanchet.
1,A TOTAL BOMB!!,"Whatever possessed Jessica Lange to appear in this mess will never be known. The payoff at the end is a huge disappointment. Jessica Lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in. Gwyneth Paltrow is unbelievably bad. But I think this is not their fault. The screenplay and direction could have been better. This could have been a very good movie along the lines of ""Misery"" or ""Fatal Attraction"" but it fails in every department. As I said, the payoff at the end is a real disappointment. This film is a waste of time and money. Stay away from it!"
1,Not a scientific view,Sam McCracken is not a scientist and spent most of his career as a speechwriter for crank contrarian BU president John Silber.
3,"Not really legendary, but not bad either","German hard rock band New Legend emerged in 1990 with this self-titled album on RCA. It's a fairly straightforward rock & roll album with a vaguely bluesy, vaguely Southern edge not unlike UK rockers Little Angels or American bands Roxy Blue and War Babies. It's not terribly original material, but it's pretty rocking and has a hefty dose of swagger that makes it fun to listen to.New Legend never really found an audience, recording just one more album (1992's Deep Colours Bleed) before calling it a day. The New Legend debut isn't a mandatory rock album by any means, but if you're into the late 80's and early 90's melodic rock sound, you could do a lot worse than to try it out, especially since it is available so cheaply.The track listing is as follows:1. No More Crazy Nightmares2. Lowlands3. Crazy Mama (Little White Temptress)4. Felt So Good5. A Lonely 1000 Nights6. Paradise (the Price You Paid)7. Angel of Mercy8. Mean Mistreater9. All the Love in the World"
5,The best book about sewing technique,"This is an incredible book. It is clearly written with profusely illustrated with excellent quality photos. It has greatly expanded my ideas about what is possible on a sewing machine. I read it from cover to cover even though I don't actually plan to use many of the techniques. However, I have already put the author's advice on blind hemming and narrow hemming into practice. I am also intrigued by the possibilities of hemstitching (stitching hems and hemstitching are totally different things). I love this book."
3,Heirloom not Couture,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. The techniques are generally those used for Martha Pullen's style of ""heirloom"" machine sewing. There's nothing wrong with that but I was hoping for something about using the machine for various aspects of ""couture"" garment work and did not find it here. Mostly the book addresses surface embellishments, not construction, and has extensive information on how to add machine ""heirloom"" embellishments to purchased garments. If you are looking for information that involves wing needles on linen, machine hemstitching and stabilizers, this book is for you. It's a very pretty book. If you want to take your machine sewing to the highest levels, it is not the one."
5,Essential for fine sewing!,I learned more in the first 15 pages of this book than I've learned about fine sewing in the last 35 years of experience! I highly recommend this book to those interested in learning and fine tuning their heirloom sewing skills.
5,Very good book,Very good book with good instructions and illustrations. I has helped me to do a better job in my sewing.
5,I Loved This Book!!!,"Charity and Mike are as different as they could be. Charity is a not so successful virgin Las Vegas Showgirl, Mike is a minister, ranch hand, cowboy. What more can you say. Charity goes to Wyoming for a family visit and runs into Mike Flynn and the sparks fly for both of them. Their story is a rollercoster ride of laughs as well as touching moments. You will see some old friends Lauren, Max, Sam, and Jack from other Pattie Berg Books. The nice thing about that is you don't have to have read Berg's other books to understand or enjoy this book. A must read."
3,sounds familiar,"The story is very similar to Sandra Brown's ""Tempest for Eden"". In that story, a minister (who is also widowed like Mike) falls in love with a nude model. That too is a story about two unlikely characters falling in love. Dont know which story was ""inspired"" by the other. Although I like Berg's story better. Hated Charity. Very self-centered and whiny."
4,Another Patti Berg delight,"I have been waiting for Patti Berg to write Mike Flynn's story. If you've read Wife For A Day and Born To Be Wild, you'll recall that he's the manager of Jack Remington's ranch.Oh yeah...he's also a minister.Don't let that fool you though, he's 100% red-blooded man.In Something Wild, Mike meets up again with Charity Wilde (Max Wilde's sister) when she visits from Las Vegas to attend a family reunion. Sparks immediately fly, tempers flare, and Mike and Charity discover that there's something going on between them.Mike, however, has his doubts that Charity would be willing to give up the bright lights of Las Vegas and become a preacher's wife in the wilds of Wyoming. Charity has herself convinced that what she's dreamt of forever is a career onstage. Little does she know that fate (and Mike) have other plans in store.I enjoyed reading Something Wild; it's a sweet story, with some sensuous moments as well. Patti Berg has penned another winner."
1,Item not compatible on Windows 7,I have this item from 1996 and it not compatible with windows 7. I have XP mode with windows 7 and it is still not compatible.
2,warning,Fans of serials beware. This is an amputated bore which misses all the cliffhangers to produce an endlessly running movie without highlights.
2,not sized properly,"These were too small for their stated size, 11.5. I wear 11.5 in Nike shoes and have a pair of white Lunar Control shoes in the same size. These were too short and narrow. Amazon took them back with no problems."
5,very comfortable,"i just got these so my review is for the early use of these shoes. right out of the box they are as comfortable a nike shoe as i have used.for me,, no need to break them in..excellent traction also..as in the past they seem to run a little small size wise. full retail at my course pro shop was $115.00.i would get another pair,,nice shoe"
3,Usually love anything nike,"The look of the shoe was disappointing.....almost looks plastic. Would not buy this product again, obviously this shoe was not cheap."
2,Alessi Richard Sapper Espresso Maker,"It makes great espresso, but since manufacturing was switched from Italy to China, the build quality of this espresso maker is not what it used to be. It does not fit together as well, and there are sharp edges in places. I've cut my hand on it twice. I am going to try one made by Stella, which is reportedly still manufactured in Italy."
5,Outstanding,"A very important product of the culture that Byzantium achieved during its long life (>1,000 years). This female author, most learned in the ancient literature and philosophy, decided to write a history of her father who refocused Byzantium prior to its decline and fall.As with most historians in the era, Anna describes in detail the proceedings of her father's court. The reader will come face-to-face with the religous discord in the empire, medieval politics, and Anna's dislike of the ""Franks,"" i.e., Latin forces of the First Crusade."
5,"If Not True, It Could Be Literature","The Alexiad is a great read both for the events described -- especially the emperor's battles of wits and might with a (from Anna's perspective) rogue's gallery of kingdoms and adventurers -- and for what the author reveals of herself, both overtly and unwittingly. By and large, Comnena is remarkably objective and a graceful writer, at least in this translation (where her occasional rambling asides are generally shifted into footnotes). The translator's footnoted comments are perceptive and unobtrusive."
2,Writing in a language 1200 years old,"Can I bring to the attention of anybody swayed by the over enthusiastic reviews of this book that Anna Comnena was writing in a language that at that time was 1200 years old and was not in use other than literarily. Can she truly give historical justice to her subject when you consider that she maybe bending her subject matter so that she can slip in those classical references that will be picked up by the toffee-nosed audience of possibly 200 people who at that time were fluent in Ancient Greek? Also considering that the language she was using was not in common usage at the time there would have been concepts and ideas that could not be expressed in that Greek, anymore than one could discuss the age of the internet in Chaucer's English. Take her with a grain of salt."
5,A Book for Wanderers,"In The Golden Apples, Welty offers a cycle of subtle, complex and often hilarious stories/myths from the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi. Told from a variety of perspectives and voices, the cycle uses southern imagery, greek mythology (sometimes via the poetry of Yeats) and musings on art and music to narrate the history of a cast of characters either absorbed by or isolated from Morgana and the surrounding world. The reader, in assembling meaning from the flood of rich narrative becomes more than a casual observer, but a participant in the ongoing mythology of Morgana.Like Winesberg or Yoknapatawpha or even Middle Earth, Welty creates a world so complete and convincing that we can't help but immerse ourselves. And what lies in the gaps between the stories and known chronology becomes just as captivating as the story we're given.Golden Apples, in its complexity, can be a lot of work. But the payoff is huge."
3,Short Story collection mascarading as a novel,"Golden Apples is a novel by Eudora Welty that reads like a series of bizarre short stories with the same recurring characters set in a fictional town in Mississippi. Some readers may find it difficult because of its use of language (...). Others may find it difficult just for it's odd prose. The chapters are not linear nor are obvious segues ever used to cue the reader in that a jump in time has taken place. There are also lots of characters with similar names making it easy to lose track of who has done what, when. If I were more drawn into the book I'd want to reread it to get the pieces I missed or misunderstood but frankly I'm just not captivated enough to want to do that right now."
4,The virtuoso plays with the micro roman,"This is a tour de force of interwoven life fragments. George Perec was apparently always far a head in all Oulipo style games (Oulipo was some sort of bizzare literary group imposing on themselves impossible challenges) and this is the result of such a self imposing dare.Well, what do you expect from a guy who wrote a long roman in French without a single instance of the letter e!Anyway, the book at hand is mainly impressive. It tells about a zillion little stories, some parallel, some crossing. All along, you feel the craftmanship of the author, in designing the characters and giving them depth and interest.Still, to me it was too post-modern to be considered a real sweeping read. If you're into a bit of experimental literature but won't give up concepts like narrative and characters, Perec is the author for you and this book (preferably in the original French) a good selection."
2,Okay but too powerful,We bought this for our outdoor cat for use in the Winter. The water became too hot and our cat would not drink from it. Would have been nice to have a heat control and/or even make a smaller version for smaller animals.Would not buy this for cats or small animals.
3,Black & White,"Not one of Gina Gershon's best roles. The plot has plenty of twists and turns. You won't know ""who dunnit"" until the very end of the film. Some interesting nude scenes. If you're a Gina Gershon fan...buy BOUND. Much better."
3,"GINA AS A HOT, HOT COP","Good cop\ba d cop is a hollywood staple, the only thing that raises this film,even a little bit, is the performance by the always wonderful and sexy GINA GERSHON.GINA, in this one MAY be a BAD cop and a KILLER. If this film had a better script, direction, and secondary cast it might come close to a film noir classic.But once again THE GREAT GINA is saddled with second rate back-up.GINA I love you,but the film is only so,so."
2,letdown,"I have recently watched Thief and Internal Affairs for the third or fourth time and both of these movies are still more engrossing than B & W which I saw for the first time. There are several flaws in this film not least of all casting, directing and script! It starts off with high expectations and quickly fizzles."
5,Suspenseful drama in a submarine,"This film is not easily forgotten for its intense suspense, stellar cast and engaging storyline. Many things happen and must happen in a submarine prepared for the worst when US is at a verge of war. Decisions must be made at the highest level of authority and it is no trivial responsibility. People's lives are involved. Must protocol be followed at the cost of good judgement? Must experience make way for prudence? What would happen when the two most senior commanders of the ship have differing views in a critical situation? The film deals with these issues in a compelling manner. The impact could not be more heightened by the brilliant performances of Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Their facial expression, movement and dialogues command our undivided attention. This is a film that stands repeated viewings. Highly recommended."
3,Disappointing transfer to DVD,"This review refers to the 1998 edition of 'Crimson Tide'. The movie itself is good, worth 5 stars. The transfer to DVD is relatively poor (not horrible, acceptable)for a recenet movie (1998). The format is widescreen, but NOT enhanced for large screen TVs, so you wind up with the ""letterbox"" picture with large swaths of black on all sides of the picture--not good for an action film like this (why do the studios still issue DVDs with this format? It is so annoying!). The sound is OK--Dolby 5.1, but the picture is somewhat grainy--moreso than it should be. The DVD transfer is mediocre at best. I viewed this on a 46-inch high definition TV, played on my Toshiba 1080p HD DVD. This movie is now available on Blu-ray which is supposed to look great. I'll repurchase the movie in Blu-ray after I decide to get a Blu-ray player."
2,"Great soundtrack, insult to submarine veterans everywhere.","I can understand the inaccuracies on the technical side, and the dramatised story. It just wouldn't appeal to the general public if it were accurate. But the portrayal of the enlisted as being a bunch of incompetent children is an insult to the men and women who have served this great country. Enjoy the story line, but know that this movie is FAR from reality."
5,SHOOT - DON'T SHOOT,"STILL AN EXCITING MOVIE AS WE LOOK AT THE DECISION-MAKING AND TENSION BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND HACKMAN. THE CONTROL OF THE SUB BECOMES THE BIG ISSUE AND SHOULD THE MISSILE BE FIRED, PROBABLY STARTING THE NEXT WORLD WAR. A GOOD MOVIE AND STILL HAS A TOUCH OF REALITY, EVEN THOUGH THE COLD WAR IS SUPPOSEDLY OVER. BUY IT..."
4,"""War itself is the Enemy..."" That and Stupidity","The Sub action is o.k. but once again the plot involves a courageous young rebel daring to ""Speak Truth to Power"" about how Nuclear war is destructive and to be avoided at all costs. The nexus of the supposed ""tension"" in this film is that ""Oh my God, he's going to launch Nuclear Missiles when he doesn't have to!!!"" Gene Hackman's character is so ridiculous and such an over the top example of ""blind obedience"" that he might as well be a cartoon. We are asked to believe that he won't even bother to confirm a garbled message to see whether or not he should launch Nuclear weapons! Fortunately, our young hero manages to get the Sub crew to mutiny and the Horror is averted. My goodness gracious, just how blood thirsty and stupid are we Military types supposed to be??"
1,Life is too short to waste any of it watching this film...,"To a former ballisic missile submarine sailor, this movie was a huge dissapointment. With fine talent like Hackman and Washington (not to mention the intriguing quality of Hackman's character) and an initial plot premise loaded with potential, this could have been a top-notch drama along the lines of but much better than Seven Days in May or The Bedford Incident. Instead the writers developed a plot so attenuated in its relationship to reality (no boomer sailor can sit through this film without feeling the urgent need to howl bulls--- with ever increasing frequency as it ""progresses"") that all you're left with is a very low grade 'B' adolescent shoot 'em up picture. What a shame. If you're at all interested in the dynamics of life aboard a ballistic missile submarine and the ""what-if"" issues raised by this film that are inherent to that life, I don't know where to tell you to turn, but don't bother looking here."
5,What dreams may come,"This was an excellent movie, I was hoping that they would all be happy with each other and when all the tragedy struck I couldn't wait to see if they would all find each other again. Gripping story."
2,Give me a break!,"First of all, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are two of my favorite actors. That said, as an ex-submariner I found this movie to be absolutely laughable and an insult to those of us who have served in the ""Silent Service"". Yes, it does raise some interesting questions, especially at the end, but the way it was done did nothing to give most people anything resembling the workings of an American nuclear submarine. I can only hope someone will get it right one of these days."
1,"""Tide ain't a-rollin' ""","Received DVD in just a couple days, however, it was poor quality, kept stopping and starting, skipping erratically, quite a nuisance to watch. Only paid six bucks for it, so I guess the adage is true, ""you get what you pay for"". Would be hesitant to order from this site in the future."
5,Very good,A great movie and the sound effects on my home theater system had my whole end of the apartment complex shaking. Lots of suspense and action....another submarine thriller along with Hunt For Red October.
3,"Great movie, poor package","I hate to give a movie I enjoy so much only three stars; understand I'm critiquing the entire package, not just the fun, well written/directed/acted movie that I still watch eagerly. I thought by buying the latest version it would have more, not less, than those previous. I was wrong. Except for the digital copy, it doesn't have so much as a trailer for the movie. And for a DVD released in '99, I would have thought it'd be formatted for wide screen TVs: it's not. I enjoy featurettes, behind-the-scenes, etc., and I know I've seen them years ago, so they do exist. You just have to buy a different copy."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, sood picture. We have seen this movie before but is one we will watch over & over. When"
5,Thought provoking.,"A well written, thought provoking story, with superb acting by D. Washington and G. Hackman. Kudos, gentlemen. To the enlisted men who claim insult, I say, ""Get off your high horse!"" Nobody ever claimed this movie represents the naked truth. It is meant to be ENTERTAINMENT! And it entertains very well. If actual veterans are so peeved by this movie that they'd give it one star, and whine about it like a sissy, then you have to wonder what DOES go on down there in the deep. Then, the movie is even more thought provoking."
2,Improbable,"This movie is a lot of fun and Gene Hackman is his usual talented self, although he reminds me of slim pickens in Dr. Strangelove - although he is portrayed as a well meaning guy, but the plot has more holes than a leaky barge. A nuclear sub only has one radio? If this is true we are in alot of trouble, The fate of the world rests on one man - the radio man??? A captain who ignores a countermanding, or at least modified command, before destroying the world. It would be his duty to find out what was on that message, not a nuisance. If he had to place his boat in jeopardy, so be it. I hope this is not the way we decide how to destroy the world. Scary."
3,Would I Want An XO Like Him?,"I dunno, but I feel that Denzel's character had an ""attitude"" that was, well, odd. I wonder what die-hard Navy types would say about him. And then would a nuclear sub have a commander as old as Hackman? This is an interesting film, but I would like to know how it would ""play out"" in the real Navy."
4,Good movie!!,"I liked this movie for many reasons:1. Top notch acting from Hackman and Washington2. The plot was strong and kept the movie going all the way through3. The action in it was fairly good, but was more of a drama movie then action.4. I could watch this movie more than once and not get bored5. Shows the sides of the military and how hard it really is to make a command!Overall, I was really impressed with the movie. It didn't depend on special effects, the actors did great at their part, especially Hackman and Washington, and the movie didn't drag. Plus, it wasn't even two hours, like Lord Of The Rings, Titanic, Pearl Harbour and Gladiator, were all too long. But this was the perfect length for a movie, maybe 10 minutes shorter would have really done it, but give and take a few, this movie was really good, all is said and done, watch this!!"
3,better than the hunt for red october!,"the hunt.. was good , but this was more excitting to me.denzel is a great actor, and when it comes to being a black military officer, noone is better than he."
1,Unrealistic and an insult to submarine professionals,"Dumb. Highly unlikely and highly insulting. It's ignorant movies like this that give the U.S. Navy a bad name. At least the folks who made the movie know more about submarines than the guy who wrote the novel (Richard Hendrick). Portrays relationship between Navy personnel as based on fear, tyranny, and intimidation. I've been a submariner, a Navy enlisted sailor, and a Navy Officer and was thoroughly insulted by the movie's portrayal of all. And what's up with this submarine that looks like a dungeon inside? Submarines are quite well lighted (who wouldn't go insane living in a dark hole for two months?). I sleep well knowing that this movie is so far fetched.... if this movie were plausible, we'd have already blown up the world."
5,complex and fast-paced,"This movie combines moral complexity, fast action, and great dialogue with plenty of humor and wit. The best part is the contrast between the two main characters. The theme of the movie is that a man strong in military theory is teamed up with a man who has more military experience...and the question becomes who will be the one to make the final decisions? Things come to a head quickly, and I was really glued to the screen. It manages to deal with violence without graphic gore, but the emotional pitch is high. Like ""the fugitive"" in that way."
3,good movie,"It's a good movie but it's still a Hollywood breed. Pets are not allowed in US Navy vessels. Outright insubordination, mutiny, attempted shootout, and much more are inconsistent with today's Navy and, as a consequence, are not easily ""dismissed"" as the movie implied."
4,Good,I thought the movie was entertaining. It did not have an all that believe able plot and that is why I gave it a 4
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW DISC SET COMING OUT. Finally this morning, Disney has delayed the DVD release of the Crimson Tide: Unrated & Extended Edition from 3/14 to 5/16. No word as to why."
4,Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman,"As the black equivalent of Errol Flynn, Denzel Washington could now be teamed up with quality leading actors. 'Crimson Tide' is such a film, and it brings together the antagonist of 'Superman' (Gene Hackman) and the protagonist of 'Malcolm X' (Denzel Washington). In it, both actors battle against each other on the same side, and the film becomes a war of internal struggles rather than external victories. Overall, it is one of the best films of 1995."
5,Special edition?,Where is the special edition? why is it taking so long for it? It is already on the european market. please release it soon this is one of the best submarine warfare movies of all time.
5,Crimsom Tide,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and I have over 200.I even watched it 3 times on one boring rainy day. I've seen it a total of about 12 times. Brilliant acting and amazing excitment for taking place on one small navy sub. Denzel showed amazing dignity and restaint with Capt. Ramsey."
5,"Surprisingly good, much to my chagrin!","I normally don't go for movies like this one, but the comical performances of Ryan Lowery and Steve Ladden as the transvestite and Toby (respectively) had me rolling on the floor laughing! This is a great movie for a beer night with the guys!"
4,4.5; Anticipating Grandadbobs future releases,"Yet another house music record that doesn't have something else going for it. I first heard this (and well pretty much was first introduced to) Grandadbob on PGR2. A great game w/ fresh music. This album is great to listen everywhere, whether its in the car or home. Thank goodness Miss Vanessa has a lovely voice behind these funky house beats. I will definitely be antcipated in their next release."
4,More History than Mystery,"This book is definitely more of a history book than a mystery book, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. The wild ride through old Germany and the adventures that befall Falco's ragtag bunch of recruits is fun. The more I read of Falco, the more likeable he becomes. And the characters we are introduced to in each book make quite an impresion. In this case an effeminate barber called Xanthus, and the lovely Helena's younger brother. Her characters seem alive, and it makes for a fun quick read. If you are interested in getting an idea of what Germany was like in 71AD, you could do worse than read this book. Looking forward to the next installment."
2,Very few worthwhile projects,"I was very disappointed in this book. It says it has 150 projects, but who really wants to build a wood napkin holder? This might be a good book for a child/young teenager who is just learning, but the projects are quite boring. I was looking for something that would either have plans for useful things, or things that could be given as gifts, such as wooden toys. There are a number of designs in here that I thought were basically the same, but with slight variations."
4,The Big Book of Weekend Woodworking: 150 Easy Projects,book came promptly and was in excellent condition. Thanks.
4,a lot of good ideas fo quick projects,easy to read and use. great for grandson projects. tried several and they came out as predicted and the kids had fun doing the work ( fun).
3,"Book filled with ""duh"" plans and projects...",Some vaguely interesting projects. Nothing here to extend woodworking skills beyond cutting and nailing boards though... A couple of nice clock projects. Some toys projects that might make good gifts or projects to get the kids off the video game consoles and doing something...You might just want to check this book out from your local library before deciding if you want to spend your hard earned cash on it...
4,Woodworking 150 Easy,I bought this book for my 13 year old son. It did not have the tools and wood explanations that I wanted but the projects are simple and look like great ones to do once we learn.
3,A bit too complicated for me!,"This is a cool book, but a bit too complicated for a novice such as myself. The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition, but there are only a few projects within that I feel capable of doing. I especially liked the vintage projects, though."
4,Great book,We purchased this book to inspire my grandfather to start working in his shop again. He has already picked out 3 different projects! The designs are not too complicated and there is a great variety of projects to do.
3,"Smaller than you think, but still fun for the kids","I'd rate this higher if the bow wouldn't have broken after only one day. Luckily, we have another bow from another toy violin that works on this one too. It's really just a simple piece of wire, but the bow is a really weak plastic stick. Also, read the specs carefully -- it's only about 6 inches long."
3,Overpriced,"These compartments are fantastic for jewerly storage. My only issue is the price. For those of you looking for a bargain don t buy here. I found the exact items at Bed Bath and Beyond, priced from 6.99-9.99. Needless to say I was really pissed off. I did not return because I had unpacked and already placed my jewerly away. However, I purchased four other compartments and I paid 9.99/ea. at BBB."
1,Disappointing,"I found this book difficult to read much less follow. I have a great interest in ""old"" Hollywood and have read many books on the subject. This book would be at the bottom of the list."
4,French journalist?,"Astonishing mistake in the Editorial Review above. That Natasha Fraser could be called a ""French journalist"" boggles the mind, since her father was the British M.P. Hugh Fraser, her mother is Lady Antonia Fraser (herself daughter of the Earl and Countess of Longford), and her mother is married to Harold Pinter! Authors all.This woman comes from as distinguised a line of BRITISH authors as can be imagined."
5,Her Best Yet,"Both ""Lita"" and ""Dangerous Curves"" were very good but I think this might be her best one yet. Lita Ford is the best female rocker of all. Strong vocals, good quality hard rock and roll, and some very nice ballads. She does it all well. Would love to see some more music from her. If you're a Lita fan, this is a must own. If you don't know who she is, this CD is a great start."
5,f***ing killer!!,Stilleto is a awesome! Lita is the Queen of Noise and one of the all time great female rockers and an absolute pro! Buy this now!
4,CD by Lita Ford,The CD was in excellent condition and I could not be happier with the swiftness of deliver. The crystal case was the only thing that was cracked but the CD was pristine.
3,Someone find this person an editor!,"Memoirs are, by nature, self-indulgent. But what made this particular book so disappointing for me, was the fact that Teri Hein had a spectacular story to tell, but it was utterly lost in the rambling, endless (and often meaningless) names and events. I started out wanting to love this book, and it WAS truly funny and endearing in parts (hence, the 3-star rating). But by the second half, I was wondering where the real ""meat"" was...the promise of a larger, more important story that was simply promised, never realized.Add to that the growing feeling that under all the snappy wit and intelligence, this is not a particularly nice person...her work with cancer victims aside. Perhaps she's trying to pay penance for a sometimes venomous take on people, but some of the depictions truly left a sour taste in my mouth.All in all, I hope this author takes another stab at writing, but I hope she finds a much better editor the next time out!"
1,albino alligator,rent this first. storyline no good and acting not very well done. boring and very slow all thru the movie
1,An attempt by great stars to make something from nothing.,Only Sinise's performance as the crook with a heart and Dunaway's tough but motherly bar maid saved this from untimate disaster. If it had a reason for being I failed to discern it. Same thing goes for a plot
1,Rank!,"This movie is convoluted and so hard to follow. It is not worth the effort. These characters are all fine one on one, but they do not come together well for a coherent story. I like Kevin Spacey quite a bit, but he needs to stay in front of the camera. It's a nightmare you will want to avoid!!"
3,Great cast with dialogue that doesn't quite match up,"I was drawn to buy this movie because of it's cast. The movie revolves around three desparate second rate crooks that get themselves in a mess and end up taking a tavern's patrons hostage. Watching this moving in 2005, it seems dated, even though I didn't think it needed to. I remember another movie involving hostage taking; a much older film, called Straw Dogs, yet it did not seem awkward watching it years later. There are a few tense moments and a few surprises along the way, but this film could have been much, much better."
1,Filmed by Democrats,"I figured a National Geographic documentary would at least attempt to be bipartisan, but this is a very political commentary, and neglects to show how many of the detainees committed terrorist acts against the U.S."
5,Semper Fidelis,"Burke Davis wrote a definitive account of the legendary 'Chesty' Puller. It's as much a biography of Puller as it is a history of the Corps, for the two were intertwined for the better part of forty years. Very easy read, always entertaining, never a dull page. Should be required reading for all military professionals, especially Marines. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Semper Fi!,"I expected to learn of all of the fabled stories of the greatest fighting Marine ever. I did and more. The author interjects with letters to his home and children which showed what a truly decent and true person that Chesty really was. I will always remember the scene where he has just survived and won some of the touighest battles in history and then scrolling a note of concern for his child's health. He was tough as nails, yet his men saw his caring side. He did not need a strategic planning session, mission statement or staff retreat. He just went for the attack and got the job done. I was truly inspired and remain so. Good night Chesty...Wherever you are!"
5,A MUST FOR FUTURE MARINES,"An excellent book! This has been the most inspirational and incredible book that I have ever had the privilege to read. The life of ""Chesty"" is an archetype of the Marine. I recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of joining the Corps. The only thing bad about this book is that it wasn't longer. Because I couldn't put it down, I had nothing to do the day after I bought it. Semper Fi!"
5,One of the best military biographys of all time.,Burke Davis has written an extraordinary book about one of the best Marine Corps officers. Lt Gen Puller's life from childhood to Korea and after is chronicled in this book. The story covers how Puller dropped out of the Virginia Military Institute and joined the Marine Corps as an enlisted Marine. Later on Puller becomes an officer earning the rank of Lieutenant General and five Navy Crosses. The only Marine in the Corps' history to earn the nation's second highest award for valor that many times.This book gives insight into one of America's best Marines. Both inspirational and helpful to Marines and other service members that have to lead troops of their own.
5,Branagh is the Master!,"Kenneth Branagh is the master! This film exhibited all of what the man is capable of giving to his performance...comedy, heartbreak, struggle, and compassion. My only wish is that Helena Bonham-Carter and he will continue to make films together in the future, because this truly is the perfect onscreen duo!"
3,If you are on brink of suicide - buy this movie.,"This is the only movie in history that made me cry. Honestly. I wish it were a happy-ending Hollywood style, but she died. And I couldn't stop my tears for half-an-hour. Who said that the America desensitization process is now complete? This movie knocks out a few bricks of that wall. I'm ashamed of myself - who knew that I can cry from a movie. The bottom line is that it is apparently based on a true story. I wish I could excercise my second amendment rights right about after the final credits. The performance of Helena Bonham Carter is impeckable. My emotions are so mixed up - I better stop writing soon. Watch for the hilarious scene of the bank robbery."
4,"A touching, compassionate story.","Based on a true story of a young woman dying of ALS and a man whose personal & professional life is falling apart. This is an excellent film with two very good performances by veteran actors Kenneth Branaugh and Helena Bonham-Carter. It's is a very touching, compassionate and heartfelt story of two likeable misfits who find love under unusual circumstances. While it is sad I also found it very uplifting and quite humorous at times. It gives you hope that anyone can pursue a dream and love truly conquers all."
2,Palacios Chorizo,I was a disappointed when I received the product later than expected (after paying more in shipping than the product cost) and found that the product had expired almost 2 months ago.
2,dissatisfied =/,"Really not as good as the one I brought home from Spain. It's is much harder, even after a few minutes on a warm skillet and has far less flavor. It looks like you get what you pay for, so if you like this type of Chorizo like I do, I would look elsewhere."
5,One of the greatest latin jazz albums,"""Nobody cooks like that man!"" ...This cd could do without the poem track, but the music is truly amazing. If only bands like this still existed."
4,Pretty good place for your Palm Z22...,"This case for the Z22 is well-built--the materials are stitched leather and synthetic leather with rigid reinforcements in a few areas. It arrived in very good time, both ahead of the predicted time and ahead of the Z22 it would hold. It does allow for storage of my business cards and a few reference cards I like to have handy. It has an easy to attach belt clip, but I haven't felt the need for a belt accessory this large too often...The only real concern I have with it is that the Z22 is not really locked in place within the case. It can readily slide out of the top of the case if I'm not careful. This is ever so slightly handy for quickly grabbing the Z22 for use outside the case, but it all still worries me. I'll be keeping an eye on it.But overall, a really good product!"
3,An enjoyable paperback...,"This is one of the better Max Brand paperbacks. Mr. Brand did an excellent job in the developing the main character, Thomas Gloster -- slow, simple minded, caring, trusting. For an enjoyable evening of reading, this paperback just might ""fit the bill""."
2,Loose bristles are picky.,"I tried. I'm a died in the wool, only-compact-flourescents-in-my-house, drive-a-hybrid eco-nut. But this brush leaves bristles in my mouth. Don't know if they skimped on glue... or what. But this isn't up to the quality of my ReNew toothbrush. I wanted to love this, too. :("
1,Boring and deceiving,"I found this album to be boring and deceiving. I expected a musical CD and found music is the last priority, most of the CD is a narration. I wish I would have known before buying it. Furthermore other reviews were misleading as to the content of the CD."
3,Angelina Box Set is GREAT!!! The prices are OUT OF WHACK,"If you like at the prices for the newer box set (released in 2006) are clearly closer to the MSRP of $27.95. This clearly NOT that much of a collectible to warrent prices in excess of $30.00! Even Amazons price is a bit more than $18.00. Pay a bit more attention to other items, ISBN numbers - don't take the first thing offered."
3,Spice Rack,"While this item adequately meets my requirements, it is expensive considering that it is merely 2 pieces of very plain, ordinary plastic that merely lay on the bottom of my cabinet. I also thought the shipping and handling for this light weight item was too much."
5,Perpetual freshness,"This DVD will be enjoyable in repeated viewing. There a freshness in presentation, a thrill in the clarity of its Gospel presentation, and sheer delight in the superb harmony and lyrics. As an 80 year old I sure do love and appreciate. I rfeckon an yone would at 8 or 28 years, as well."
1,"""Blade Runner meets The Da Vinci Code""?!! -- Not even close.","To even attempt to put this movie on par with ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Da Vinci Code"" is absolutely laughable. This movie was a failed attempt at trying to be artsy and intellectual. On top of that, during the entire movie I was saying to myself, ""Hey look, those are actors pretending to make a movie."""
4,Interesting book,"I read this book while living at the orthogenic school. To tell you the truth, I found it intriguing but I didn't really enjoy the style of writing.For people who the the Orthogenic School was abusive- most place at the time would lock disturbed children in rooms and tie them to beds for weeks on end. Race theory was prevalent, as was insulin shock therapy. Autistic children were likely to be institutionalized for their lives in dark, cruel places. In this respect, the Orthogenic School was revolutionary- it attempted to do neither of these things and tried to treat children like human beings. Were there a lot of therories that are majorly messed up? Yes. Was Bettelhiem abusive? Probably. But I have trouble believing that the school wasn't better than the other alternatives of the time."
1,Amazon Can Not Get This Book - try Used and New,"I ordered this book in January with an expected delivery date of 2/9 - 2/16. I recently received the 3rd ""Order Delay"" notification with an expected delivery date of June - July timeframe. The book is out of print and the Amazon direct page still states ""This title usually ships within 2 to 3 weeks"".I ordered it from a local bookseller and will pick it up this weekend. You can also try ""Used and New""...looks like many are available."
4,I can finally see my jewelry!,"I've had my jewelry in boxes as far back as I can remember, and is the reason why most of them never got worn. It was always a hassle to have to sift through them, with much of the necklaces being tangled. This completely solves this problem. Velvet fabric is a nice touch, as it's color is rich and makes the pieces stand out. The compartments are nicely sized, some smaller than others for more dainty pieces. I did mark it down one star for it's very flimsy top cover, but at least it came with one. Would have preferred a more solid plastic for added stacking stability, but so far, I am satisfied with it overall."
1,Need more,I normally have been using the Exam Cram books to study for the Microsoft TCP/IP and Windows NT 4.0 certification tests. Using the Exam Cram books I was able to pass both tests with flying colors. I decided to deviate from the Exam Cram books and try the Exam Prep book for the NT Server test and did not pass the test. The book is informative for someone who has minimal experience. But you need more on target information to prepare you for the actual tests the way the Exam Cram books do.
4,Surprisingly Good,I really enjoyed this book. I picked up a pre-pub copy and zipped through it in a couple of days. There were a few far-fetched parts but overall this book was highly entertaining. I was left wondering what Nine would do next!
5,Loved it,"Coming from experience, I could relate to Nine....I loved it. Absolutely loved it. It was hard trying NOT to read it ;)"
3,Great Romance but sometimes hard to follow...,"I loved the romance between the characters. There relationship starting out was so interesting and hard to put the book down, almost made me want to give it 4 stars BUT the book was hard to follow sometimes. It had references that I had know idea what it was even talking about, which made it hard to follow at times. (Not talking about the poetry aspect.) I will say I bought the book from Books a Million and I was pleasantly suprised to open the cover and find that the book was signed by the author and dated. That was really awesome I had never seen anything like that before. So kudos to the author!"
5,Excellent!,I honestly could not put this book down! It was so interesting. It's also good because it is an issue many high school girls think about. Many don't go to the extremes that nine does but it is an issue in our lives. I definately reccomend this book!
5,First Love,"Teach Me is an intense story about a smart, funny, focused high school senior girl called Nine, who gets blindsided by the attentions of her English Literature teacher, Mr. Mann. The attention turns into romance, and our previously focused-on-schoolwork high school senior becomes focused on the teacher. The author handles a taboo topic with sensitivity and humor--I want to read more about Nine! And what happens to Mr. Mann!"
1,Inappropriate,"How is this book viewed as anything other than totally inappropriate? Unless I am missing something, it is about a teacher using his position of authority to ""consummate"" his ""relationship"" with a high school student, and it is on the book shelves in the young reader sections. This book should be widely condemned, especially given all the stories of high school teachers taking advantage of students. Parents should not allow their children to read this book, as I unfortunately suspect some immature readers would think it is ""cool"" to ""consummate"" their ""relationship"" with a high school teacher."
3,Fails to scratch the surface,"This book was quite an intriguing read. It was smart. It was funny. It was unique. I would be lying if I said it was an entirely unpleasant experience.However, I caught myself rolling my eyes a great deal while reading this book. The unique language and style often morphed into a poor gimmick during crucial points of the plot, masking the lack of depth in the characters and the situation. The book itself is highly aggresive and melodramatic, rarely slowing down to give any insight whatsoever. The plot drops off halfway through the book, opting for the hackneyed revenge arc of a scorned woman instead of exploring realistic repercussions of the characters' actions. The book concludes without any real lesson learned, loose strings tied together in an appropriately clichéd way.Overall, an interesting but highly sensationalized read. I'd consider it little more than fanciful entertainment."
5,The Hasty Review,"I am just so happy to find out that I can get a video on this remake ""The Hasty Heart"". Like the reviewer above, I saw this film many years ago....actually 15 years ago and about 6 years ago, I tried to look for it but no video store carried it. Its a movie I will never forget....the emotions I felt when I saw it....oh I am so happy I can get the video now. Thank God for the internet. This movie is probably one of best I have ever seen. Cherly Ladd...I could fall in love with her."
5,A little sensitivity goes a long way!,I saw this movie over 10 years ago and have NEVER forgotten it. I have been unable to find it until today for sale OR rental anywhere. I rate this as one of my personal 10 best movies of all time!
2,Average,Shootdown examines Flight 007 in good depth but strays off course in many aspects. Some of the chapters ramble on too much while others the author can barely hide his dislike of Reagan along with members of his administration. When the author sticks to the subject the book does offer alot of information on what really happened to Flight 007.
4,"Gosh, This Is A Swell Movie.","This is a pretty neat latter day screwball romance comedy. The honcho who thought of casting Benicio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone as potential lovers is either a genius or ready for the asylum. Regardless there is palpable chemistry between the two that produces kinetic sparks. A bonus is Christopher Walken as Silverstone's ambiguous Uncle Ray. You didn't really think a mere band of bikers could intimidate the Walkenator, did you? If there's a gripe to made is that the story is kind of thin, trite, and predictable. That said I'm not going to complain about a movie that has the gumption, for the most part to go the beat of its own quirky rhythms. It recalled to me films like ""Something Wild"" and ""True Romance"" that defied romance film convention."
1,"Bad, bad movie. Bad movie. Bad.","This movie was not only far-fetched and pathetically scripted, Alicia Silverstone's performance was awful. She was in the movie for one purpose: to show the audience that the set was cold. Very cold. (And if anyone doesn't know what I mean by this, watch about 16 seconds of the movie. Remember, only 16 seconds. Longer exposure could cause permanent damage). Bluntly put (as if the rest of this was tactful) Excess Baggage was very, very bad. Granted, that is my opinion. If you don't believe me, watch it. I just didn't want anyone's stupidity on my conscience. Remember: bad movie. As always, rather than watching this movie, I'd recommend watching The Terminator again."
1,WARNING WARNING WARNING -- NOT Widescreen,"Despite the earlier review here about the disc received from Amazon in Jan 2004 and despite the description of this item that says ""Format: Fullscreen, Widescreen"" the disc I recieved in July 2005 is Pan&Scan; only. Yech!I love the movie, but Pan & Scan is unacceptable."
3,i love bdt,The movie was only strictly likeable and a lot of thanx to BDT for that.though he was very convincing as the hapless car thief there was a lot amiss about silverstone's character.The movie manages to stand on a very tepid and weak script and the climax is a damp squib.watch it only for BDT.He will completely blow u off.Cheers!
3,Kind of fun...del Toro looks great!,"This is a silly film, but I liked it anyway. Emily (Silverstone) never gets any attention from her rich dad. Mom died when Emily was very young, so she has been richly neglected for years. Emily stages a kidnapping, only to be inadvertently kidnapped by a car thief played by Benicio del Toro. I admit, I rented the film to see him. I wasn't disappointed in seeing del Toro in this film. The story is not that great, but after I saw it the second time (to see del Toro, okay!) it kind of grew on me. Christopher Walken plays Silverstone's uncle to perfection."
1,False advertising,"Contrary to the product description above, this dvd is NOT, NOT, NOT widescreen!!! It is only fullscreen, which is not how I want to see movies.And of course I can't get a refund, since I didn't discover this little nugget of info until I opened and played the thing! Thanks a lot to whoever wrote this misleading, false product description, and thanks to an unfair return policy that makes the customer pay for the retailer's lies or mistakes. I'm taking my money elsewhere!!!!"
1,"Sorry, it's not that good, dudes","Started out okay and fell apart, oh, about ten minutes into it. Christopher Walken was completely wasted. I would have rather watched a movie about his character than this whiny Gen X romance. As usual, in the Hollywood mentality, it is better to end up with an unrepentant car thief than to actually, I don't know, GET A JOB!Sorry, I had a hard time tolerating the lead character. The poor little rich girl thing is really beginning to wear thin. (I mean, it was over in the 30s, guys!) The movie is just painful to sit through. The comedy is lame, the ""darkness"" has been done better before, any good actors are wasted on a nothing script, the action makes no sense, the characters are obnoxious...But why go on. Try it and don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Looking for Love?,"Benicio Del Toro is a magnet in this movie, a strong acting force drawing you into that deep, hypnotic voice until you're head over heels in love. There are a handful of male characters that I could easily spend the rest of my life with, and Vincent Roche is one of them. He's a guy that will make you laugh, that you can talk to about anything, that you'd feel safe with, and that you'll lust after as well. Benicio is a leading actor who is too often cast in only supporting roles. Lead the way Benicio!"
5,Wonderful Film with 5 star Wide-Screen Anamorphic Picture,"Won't try to compete with other folks saying good things about this wonderful film, but wanted to confirm that the DVD received from Amazon.com in January 2004 is a superb transfer with full screen on one side and gorgeous Anamorphic 16:9 widescreen on the other. Watching films on a widescreen television is the coolest! Be aware it's necessary to tell your DVD player (in the set-up menu) to format for a 16:9 screen. This automatically outputs any anamorphic DVD as full-screen (without black bars top and bottom). This will look tall & skinny on an old-fashioned 4:3 monitor, but when stretched to fill a wide 16:9 screen it looks glorious!"
5,"charming,witty a wild ride!","hold on to your hearts as car thief Del Toro foils Silverstone's""kidnapping"" and ends up with more than he bargained for in this sweetheart of a movie!"
2,Wish it had a plot,"I don't hate this movie, it had good parts. But it had no real plot, the guy and girl fall in love but the story isn't based around that. I think it dragged on at the end, I would not recommend it to anyone, yet it was better than some films you will see."
1,THE MOST TERRIBLE MOVIE EVER MADE.,what were those ppl. thinkin of when they made this movie. if there was a list for the worst movies ever this on would definitely top the list
1,Agonizing,The only movie I've ever walked out of a theater during because it was so painful to watch...
3,boring,was good the first time watching it but it dose not have replay value it will put you to sleap the best part was whean it was over they climbed in to the trunk to make out
2,Silverstone can't even keep this comedy afloat.,"This film has bad acting, bad plotting, and bad writing. The film was obviously made only to showcase Silverstone's charm so comically shown in ""Clueless"", but she, nor any other cast members, is not given enough to work with. Only gets 2 stars for a couple of funny (but not that funny) lines, and the fact that I loved ""Clueless""!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"Speed 2 is the dumbest, most ridiculous movie imaginable, with terrible performances, nonsensical story-lines, ridiculous parallels, and of course Jason Patric, who is as believable an action star as any WWE Superstar. Hey Geiger... If they fired you for being sick, why not just sue them instead... haven't you ever seen Philadelphia?"
4,an octopus with claws and a magnifier,"A little smaller than i expected but suiting for the purpose. Solid metal construction, good mobile joints, and a solid weighted nonslip base. only issue is the finger screws are hard to tighten and loosen and the magnifying glass becomes unscrewed if not tighted and handled. Other than this, this helper will get the job done just fine, and can pretty much be put in any position your project would require."
1,Does not play from a computer CD player,"I purchased this CD thinking it had songs on it (a best-of) and popped the CD into my cd player on my PC so I can listen while I work, and lo! There are no songs on the CD. There is a cheezy ""multi-media"" bit of crap that wants to install all sorts of Microsoft mal-ware and spy-ware on your PC (it's quite obvious about it). If you just want to listen to the music, you cannot. You are not buying music, you're buying spyware. You cannot listen without installing crap-ware all over your machine. When I finally decided to try, my anti-virus software screamed, my anti-spyware software went nuts... This is bad news.They say it has music but only if you install their advertizing and spyware. I'm returning it and getting a real CD of someone else's music, not some Microsoft drone's music. Andreas, get a new music label and get back to the business of music, not spyware."
3,"A Few Stand-Outs, But Not Their Best","This is at the bottom of the Journey catalog. ""Arrival"" (recorded 2000) is the better Steve Augeri-era record. Faith In The Heartland (which they re-did on ""Revelation"") and Place In Your Heart are great songs. In Harm's Way is a rocker, as well. Each band member sings lead on a tune, or two. Disc also contains the ""Generations EPK."" For fans, only."
2,The apple falls far from the tree.....,"Like some have said here before, it's not that ""Generations"" is a bad album, it's just not really a Journey album. The tossed-salad approach to the vocals is frustrating and irritating. They should have stuck with Augeri on all tracks and maintained a consistent sound and musical profile. The songs are o.k. for the most part. No real standouts and a few clunkers. I listened to this one all the way through only once and haven't gone back but once or twice to sample. Very ill-conceived and mediocre at best. ""Arrival"" was superior in every way, too bad it wasn't promoted properly. Here's hoping ""Revelation"" is a return to form."
4,TRACK LISTING - 13 SONGS + enhancements:,"1. Faith In The Heartland2. Place In Your Heart, The3. Better Life, A4. Every Generation5. Butterfly (She Flies Alone)6. Believe7. Knowing That You Love Me8. Out Of Harms Way9. In Self Defense10. Better Together11. Gone Crazy12. Beyond The Clouds13. Never Too Late - remixed version (bonus track)Bonus Feature: Generations EPK"
4,"Journey Fans, Rejoice!","IF YOU LIKED ""ARRIVAL"" AND ""RED 13"", YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM. There are a number of strong tracks here; my current favorite is ""A Better Life"", sung by drummer Deen Castronovo, who has a great voice by the way. If you have not heard the ""new"" Journey (with Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo replacing Steve Perry and Steve Smith, respectively), check out this album. I am a big fan of both Steve Perry and Steve Smith, but I am happy with Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo being in Journey. The direction of the songwriting is a little different without Steve Perry, but if you have an open mind, you will not be disappointed. There is also a 10-minute video accessible only via computer, which features interviews with the band. The video quality suffers horribly from compression, but it was fun to watch."
2,A shadow of past glories,"Don't get me wrong - I truly love Journey's music. I grew up with them. But just because they once were great doesn't mean that they are incapable of doing wrong, just like any other human beings are - especially re-formed version of veteran bands. And I'm sorry, but this new version of the band is a mere shadow of the band I loved and grew up with. The first album with new vocalist Steve Augeri sounded too much like the work of a Journey cover band, with a few decent moments thrown in. This second release with Augeri does not sound like a cover band anymore, but that doesn't mean it's great - and you'd have to be the most self-deceived type of ""fanboy"" out there to think it is. It tries too hard to sound relevant and it's just not. It actually embarrases me to listen to this new stuff because it sounds so desparate. I'd much rather listen to Neil Schon's solo work than this - or old, classic, Steve Perry-era Journey."
1,"No Perry, No Journey","They should have changed the name of the band. Steve Perry made journey the success it was. They can hire all the new singers they want, but they will never be as great as Steve Perry. There's just no comparison!"
2,"Give me ""Infinity""","While Journey's current stage show may be a state-fair-quality-facsimile of their early 80s arena-filling heyday, their subsequent albums have never even come close to filling the void. I dare say that we weill never again hear anything on a par with the material from the Greg Rollie days, and probably only graze the surface of the Jonathon Cain stuff.And by the way, I just want to make a quick suggestion to the reviewers here who are actually psycho-analyzing each track on this album: Try listening to some Styx, particularly the song ""Too Much Time On My Hands""."
3,"Great Direction, But...","What's up with the sound quality???Always been a big fan of Journey. Love the current line up. The drummer can sing and sounds a bit like Steve Perry. There are some really good songs on Generations, but I find it hard to listen to because of the mix. I have Captured, the live album from 1981, produced by the same guy, and the mix is incredible. Songs worth mentioning; Every Generation, Out Of Harm's Way, Faith In The Heartland, Never Too Late. Knowing That you Love Me is OK, but those N SYNC backgrounds have to go."
2,Sounds more like a B-side compilation,"I'm not sure what a couple of these glowing reviewers were listening to, but this CD doesn't sound like the Journey I'm used to hearing. The Arrival had some decent tracks intermixed with so-so ones, but this CD is just riddled with bad soundalikes that might as well as be on the 4th CD of a 3-CD box set somewhere. I like Steve Augeri, but there's nothing on here anywhere close to ""Remember Me,"" ""Higher Place"" or ""We Will Meet Again"". Save your money and download the first 4 songs. ""Better Life"" is by far the best track... and it's not even Augeri singing it."
2,Too many Lead Vocalists!!,"This is a step down from Arrival. That was a true Journey record with a major label backing it up. This one lacks the backing and the band had too much ""freedom"" to do as they wanted as far as writing and recording. Some of the songs are pretty good like ""Faith In The Heartland"". Others songs could have been good except someone came up with the worst decision to let each member take a turn at lead vocals. Not just a few lines but ENTIRE songs!!! That is the biggest turn off for a listener. I hate it so much! If Steve would have sang all of the songs on this record I think as a whole it would have come off better. It's just all over the place as it stands now. Maybe they should re-release it with Steve Augeri vocals only, not that they will. If you want a good listen check out Soul Sirkus featuring some intense guitar playing from Neil Schon and great vocals from Jeff Scott Soto. Skip the Generations cd."
1,This is the worst Journey album worse than trial by fire,I was wrong when I wrote my earlier review that Trial By Fire was the worst album of Journey. This one definitely wins hands down. The music is not pleasant to listen to save for a few songs like A Better Life and Never Too Late. Deen Castronovo has quite a good voice for a drummer but Steve Perry he definitely is not. This album was a bit self-indulgent with each band member taking shot at lead vocals. They should realize there is a reason why there is only one lead singer in a band and that is because they can sing. The guys sound great singing backup vocals but when you take the lead you should have a great voice not a so-so voice.
5,Awesome CD !!,"This CD proves that Journey just keeps getting better and better. They have proven their talent by having each member sing lead vocals. This band is much better now that Steve Perry is not in the line up. Just listen to NEVER TOO LATE which is now my favorite Journey song of all time. Deen Castronovo's vocals are incredible. He sounds even more like Steve Perry then Steve Augeri!For those Steve Perry fans who can't accept the current Journey line up, GET OVER IT ALREADY! Just listen to this CD and other CD's from the current band to realize just how incredibly talented they are. On their latest tour they played for three hours! It was amazing to hear their songs from the beginning. Keep up the good work Journey!"
3,"It's pretty good, not great","Hmm. I don't quite get all the 5 star reviews. ""Generations"" is not a bad cd but, it doesn't rank 5 stars. Steve Augeri is a great singer and frontman. Deen Castronovo is a monster on the drums and has a killer voice as well. I thought ""Arrival"" was pretty cool. I really loved the song ""Remember Me"" from the ""Armageddon"" sountrack and I liked the EP, ""Red 13"" alot. In all fairness, I just got it and, maybe it'll grow on me more but, it doesn't sound all that good in my car. I really had to fool with the sound to get it decent.""Generations"" is good, it just doesn't give me wood, ya know?I just hope Steve Perry does a follow-up to ""For the Love Of Strange Medicine."""
1,this cd sucks,journeys new album is the worst ive heard from them in yrs i think its about time they bring back steve perry and record the real journey music fans have loved for yrs this new lead singer steve augeri is a steve perry wannabe it makes me sick to know that the group would release horrible music and label it under journey the should label it trash cause thats where my cd is going. journey fan 4 ever
1,Journey needs Steve Perry!!!,"This could have been a great album, with Steve Perry on the lead vocals, but instead, we have more of a Journey tribute album. This band would be ok, if it were called, The Neil Schon Band. The real Journey started with Infinity, and ended with a Trial By Fire. Look alikes, sound alikes, and name alikes. Neil schon is just dreaming about the glory days of the band, and can't let go of the fact, that it is over, unless, the real Steve is put back in the place he belongs, as the real frontman of this dead band."
1,Skip this generation,"This is by far the worst Journey CD. Having multiple vocalists is not a good idea, especially when 3/5 of them are not good singers. There are only four songs I still listen to today. The first two tracks sung by Augeri, ""Faith In The Heartland"" and ""Place In Your Heart"". Faith in The Heartland has gotten a second life since it was re-recorded with new vocalist Arnel Pineda for the 2008 Revelations disc. The other two decent tracks were both sung by drummer Dean Castronovo, ""Better Life"" and ""Never To Late."" The rest of the songs are terrible. I heard that The U.S. government has replaced waterboarding with forcing suspected terrorists to listen to the Ross Valory sung ""Gone Crazy"" over and over. I don't know if this is true, but I literally would go crazy after listening to that song more than once. I really like Arrival and Revelations, but my advice is to skip Generations."
1,It just ain't the same,"Really great? Better than Arrival? Best since Frontiers? I must have been listening to a different c.d. I could barely get through this. I thought Arrival was pretty good, and I liked it better the more I listened to it. But Generations doesn't sound like Journey is on the upswing. It might be new, but it's not great Journey music. I've been a fan since Steve Perry just joined and I even liked Raised on Radio. I've seem them twice since they re-formed and they put on a great Journey-like show. But as far as creativity, let's be honest: Journey's best music was written by Perry and Cain. Sans Perry, it sounds like Journey, but it lacks the creativity."
1,Not My Generation,"I have listened to this cd and I disagree with many of the reviewers of this cd. I do not think this cd is good. It is not an easy listen because their are too many vocalists. I have been a fan of Journey since I first saw them in 1978 and own all of their cds. This cd will be filed and probably never played again. I saw Journey open up for Def Leppard this year and I was dissappoined by the songs they played on this tour. I would not recommend this cd but if you want to hear Journey at their best check out Infinity or Captured. Another good buy are the two Journey DVDs, ""Greatest Hits 1978 - 1997"" and ""Live In Houston 1981""."
2,Journey is now a gig band!,"The new Journey is a GOOD gig band. Steve Augeri does a good job covering Steve Perry's vocals and singing the classic songs. But new material is a different story! Steve Augeri does not have the power in his voice to pull off these songs. He does pretty good on some of the ballads, but on the up beat songs, it just sounds like a generic 80's group. This band would have NEVER made it, not even in the 70's or 80's with Steve Augeri. Anyway, dont hesitate to see them live, as a replacement singer Journey couldnt have done better. But there's a big difference between live and making NEW CD's. You need some catchy songs, some airplay, and a SOLID overall CD to gain new fans. Journey could never do that with this singer and these songs, not at any point in history!!"
5,"Journey's ""Generations"" Rocks!",The best Journey CD ever bar none (at least until they release something newer). Steve Augeri shares the lead vocals with his band mates and gives us a far better Journey experience. Unless you just cannot accept a Journey without Steve Perry you will love this CD. Combines a mixture of many moods which have influenced the band members. And most definately should be played with whatever bass enhancer your stereo has turned on. Otherwise turn up the volume and crank up the bass. This CD rocks!
4,Great action movie but very inaccurate ++++++++,"Great war movie with lots of tanks. Too bad these were not the real Tigers and King Tiger Tanks but American M-48 tanks painted Panzer Grey. The acting is very good, especially Robert Shaw as Col. Kessler. The song ""Panzerlied"" by the way is still used by the German Panzer division today. Over all a good way to spent 3 hours on a Friday night."
1,BEWARE - Cheap Price Because you only get 1/2 the movie,"BEWARE No wonder it's so low priced. At aspect ratio 1.33:1 it's only 1/2 the film. While the accuracy of the story line is in question to only see 1/2 is just not right. The film was origionally widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I have it in that widescreen and without it, you miss a lot."
3,It's not accurate but it is entertaining.,"I'm a little biased toward this film because I watched it as a kid and I loved it. It is a decent movie, but absolutely not an accurate portrayal of the Battle of the Bulge. The title of the movie is really misleading as it is a fictional account that is loosely related to an actual battle. The movie uses 50's era tanks to represent the German panzers, and they don't look anything close to the real one's. There is little or no mention of the famous places or conflicts that took place. Robert Shaw is great as the main Nazi commander, but he plays a fictional character named Hessler. In fact, there is no mention of any real life names from the battle. No Bradley, Patton, Peiper, Manteuffel or even Eisenhower. The whole thing was very puzzling. Still, for what it is, it's not a bad movie. It has an all star cast with some good performances. The battle scenes are good. Just don't expect to go away from this having learned anything about the real battle."
1,Terrible movie,"If the name of an event is used in a movie, then it should be as factual as possible. Where is the snow and the armies wearing the proper uniform. How come fictional characters and events were used. I thew my copy in the trash where it belongs. I is not based on a true story as it says it is. It should be lnamed ""Battle of the Bulge, a fictional story"""
5,great movie with true to life action,This movie is one of the best depictions of the war. It stays true to reality and shows what human toll was taken and human valor given.
3,rollicking battle sequences in a grim landscape,"This is an entertaining account of the momentous German offensive launched through the Ardennes in the winter of 1944. Many of the battle sequences are outstanding, even if there is rather a comic-book feel to some of the action. The impressive cast list includes the great Robert Shaw as a convincingly blond German officer and even if the characters are somewhat one-dimensional this is not terribly important in such a film. The best feature of this movie, however, is the way in which the bleak landscape is captured on film. The dark, frosty terrain that formed the backdrop for the battle is well portrayed adding a grimly atmospheric mood."
1,Hollywood trivializatoin at its worst,"My brother and I attended the premiere of this movie at a special showing at the Empire Theatre in Kansas City. I was only 13, so I really enjoyed it and still have the booklet that was handed out. However, as an adult, the only thing about this movie I can say is worthwhile MAY be the German military singing by Panzergruppe Pieper. I also still enjoy the cynicism of Pieper's aide-de-camp toward the whole attempt. If you pretend that this has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Battle of the Bulge (because it really doesn't), it can be considered an enjoyable WWII fiction flick. As far as grinding on the producers about not using Tiger tanks, well, we can even complain about Spielberg's Tigers made from T-34 mockups in SPR, can't we? Tanks are hard to do right in a flick. Perhaps Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic will be able to come up with good animations of them for future movies."
4,Blu-ray really makes this movie stand out,"I'm not going to tell you the story, heck, most of you looking to buy it have already seen it. I have both DVD and Blu-ray and must say that Blu-ray really adds something to it. I don't know if it's clarity, colors, sharpness, or all that and more but if you have a Blue-ray player I'd nudge you to purchase the Blu-ray version of the movie."
1,battle of the bulge,Product came in excellent condition. The viewing of the movie was very good-you would have thought it was brand new. My husband loves world war 11 movies-this is a favorite. Happy to have it in our collection.
2,Cringewothy mangling of history and a Hollywood plot contructed largely of cliches,"While they got a few factoids correct about one of the most notable battles in US Army history, the overall mess this movie represents puts it at the bottom of the list of big budget WWII films. With a decent cast, but terrible writing and effects. Usually you can at least say, ""well the special effects were good"", but this dreck doesn't even reach the level of 1960's Japanese monster movie quality. The tank battles are laughable with American tanks standing in for German (which is understandable), but WHY didn't they use Shermans to represent Shermans??? It's not like There weren't M4 tanks available in Europe. Others here have already said that sunny Spain is hardly a suitable venue to represent the snow and forests of Belgium. If you love history or are a tank enthusiast, this is a movie to skip."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Turgid, overlong, simplistic, and certainly not historically accurate, Battle of the Bulge is a chore to watch and definitely not a rewarding one--there are very few reasons to see it but a whole host of reasons why not to."
3,Screen,"I have a 36"" tv at home, Movie quality is good but I can't see the movie full screen because of it's blacked out 3"" above & below the movie. Why?"
4,PUT ALL THE FAT BACK INTO THE BATTLE OF BULGE,"I JUST BOUGHT A 1965 TAPE AND 4 PARTS WERE CUT OUT OF IT I SAW THIS MOVIE AT MOVIES WHEN I WAS A KID.THE PARTS THAT WERE CUT OUT WERE THE SPYS DOING A COMMANDO RAID IN THE BUNNKER HALLWAY ,A WALK THROUGH THE MOTOR POOL, THE SHOOTING OF THE FATHER NOT THE BOY ,AND THE MAJOR TALKING TO THE COL.ABOUT SHOOTING POWS. I THINK THEY SHOULD PUT THE MOVIE BACK TOGETHER ALL THE MOVIE.FACE IT, IT IS A CLASSICE WAR MOVIE AND IT SHOULD BE SOLD THE WAY IT WAS SHOWN IN THE MOVIES.NOT ALL CUT UP!I AM LOOKING FOR A 1965 TAPE THAT HAS NOT BEEN CUT AND IS FULLSCREEN. THE SEARCH IS ON."
4,A FAVORITE MOVIE,WELL DONE MOVIE--MANY MAJOR STARS IN THE CAST--GOOD STORYLINE--WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MOST OF MY FRIENDS--ANY THAT LIKE ACTION--WWII MATERIAL --OR GOOD DRAMA
5,Great movie,"this movie is a war classic starring many fine actors, Henry Fonda plays a pivital role with his usual casual ease"
4,WW2 Classic,"A world war 2 classic well written, acted and filmed. Movies are for entertainment, documentaries retell actual events. This film is extremely entertaining. The story for dramatic effect, is not true to actual events. Over the years, I am not certain how many times I have watched this film. I enjoy George Montgomery's, Charles Bronson's and James MacArthur's character's the most. Although, Robert Shaw's and Henry Fonda's are a close second. I have this film on VHS, I plan to purchase it on DVD."
5,War Movie,Excellent war movie and extremely clear on Blu Ray. Item awas as described and shipped very quickly. Excellent buy. Highly recommended.
2,The Battle of the Bulge,"What a Lame Movie! .Whenever i see it on TV during channel surfing my crindge!Historically inaccurate,terrible acting.The tank battle special effects are something out of a Godzilla flick.When i saw the Panzer Leader(Robert Shaw)riding atop a painted over ""American tank""I wanted to scream! Dont buy this movie!"
4,Good action,"Battle of the bulge is a inteesting movie. I have watched it a number of times and still like it. The acting is great. Fonda does his usually great work,And Shaw and Reed Bronson. Truly great cast.There are a number of sub-plots to this movie with Telly Savalas and his roving store and James MacArther and his clan.If you want a good old fashon army movie buy it and watch it"
1,Give us a DVD Warners!!!,"Why oh why has Warners not got around to putting this out? Is it legal restrictions, bureaucracy or just plain stupidity?"
2,Not Happy,I received the Blu Ray on the date as promised but when I tried to play it on my Sony Blu Ray player it would not play. The unit just said invalid disk. The strange thing is that it plays on my portable Blu Ray player.So I quess I will have to watch it on the portable one.
1,LAUGHABLY INACCURATE EQUIPMENT,"This movie is a joke. It's just terrible. It's history, it needs to be accurate. Oh, the humanity!"
3,"More ""Bulge"" in Bulge Needed!",The orginal Battle of the Bulge movie was very good entertainment. I grew up watching this movie in the '70s and it was always a movie I looked forward to watching. The actors are all first rate and they do give good performances.If you are looking for this movie to be completely historically accurate then you are in the wrong place. But the director never intended for it to be an accurate representation so it should not dissapoint you too much that everything is not according to Hoyle.Where the current version falls apart is in all of the missing scenes that have been cut out of the video. It is very frustrating to watch a movie you like and find it chopped to pieces. We just have to hope that this once fine movie will be re-edited back to its original format and be released on DVD soon.The Bottom line: Wait for the DVD. the VHS version just doesn't cut it.
4,The Epic Battle,"I enjoyed the movie very much. The acting was excellent, Fonda, Ryan, Bronson, and Shaw as the German commander were excellent. I strongly disagree with Maltin's ratings of 2 stars, go figure. I am over 50 and a WW II buff. I'm guessing the reviewer was under 30 and found it boring. It's a good lesson from history."
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie with superior acting by the well known actors. Scenery is outstanding. I recommend this movie to all WW II viewers.
3,personnel use,"The movie was OK, not great, but not bad either. I wanted a few movies about WW2. I would say the movie was interesting, but I would not watch it a second time, I don't think."
4,Love. Henry Fonda,"This is an Good movie that I wanted in my collection to share with my family, I was not disappointed!"
3,Not always historically accurate,I was disappointed that there was not a greater attention to detail in this movie. Many of the German tanks were in reality American (modern version) tanks. Little things like that tended to detract from the authenticity of the film and made it less enjoyable to me.
2,"Not overly factual, but some great actors","Primarily, I enjoy war movies that provide factual recounts of the events or persons covered in the film. Not war movies for the sake of a war movie. The movie ""Battle of the Bulge"" does not provide much of anything historic, but uses the historic event to tell it's own ""Hollywood-istic"" story.There are some great actors in this film, though. It is they, in my simple opinon, who provide any redeeming value to this film.If you like action WWII war movies you will probably enjoy this. If you excpect some semblance of history this film will likely not impress you too much.It sure would be nice to have Hollywood do a ""Battle of the Bulge"" in ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" fashion ( my basis for judging all war movies )."
2,Battle of the Bulge?,In Germany they called this movie The Last battle. Baron Hasso Von Manteuffel was a harsh critic he said it was an insult to both sides and failed to show the conditions and was totaly inaccurate. I agree to call this battle of the bulge is a farce. This all star farce is one of the biggest turkeys ever.
4,Star-Struck...That's All,"I only ordered this Battle of the Bulge DVD because I'm a Robert Shaw fan. All his parts that were hacked out of the movie that's been shown on TV are in here. Plus some good candid shots of him making the movie and an interview he gives at the end.As for the movie itself, Henry Fonda doesn't get much of a chance to shine, even though he's the main character. Telly Savalas is always a trip. He has the only good role besides Robert Shaw. And the only role with any romance.I'm having trouble playing this movie. It pauses in parts and won't skip to different topics on the main menu. I'm playing it on my computer, so that could be causing those problems. If you're not a big fan of one of the actors, or you're not a war buff, I would say this movie doesn't offer much."
4,"Good war movie, But:","It is not exactly how it happened. I will let you read some of the other reviews that will give better historic information. But at least Warner had the good sense to restore it to its original length. They had cut out many important scenes from the VHS version that were restored to this DVD. For that reason I gave it 4 stars. There are not many extra features, only two brief featurettes on the making of the film, and a theatrical trailer. If you just want to watch a war movie, make some popcorn and enjoy. If you want a history lesson, watch the History Channel."
2,See a documentary or read a book on the subject,"Wide-screen is the only way to see this movie, but you better have a front projector or a really big TV as the 2.76 aspect ratio of this ponderous production will look like a band-aid on your television. Not much good history and the staging is so old fashioned that you may want to just run this film in the background while you do something else. The real Battle of the Bulge is exciting history, but you would not know it from this film. Unless you are older or just like looking at a few older movie stars (that most young people will not recognize), I would check out a good documentary or watch the Bulge episode of BAND OF BROTHERS."
2,"a fondly remembered movie from childhood,it doesn't stand the test of time",i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it's age and it really gets the history wrong. part of the problem is that other than robert shaw's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost. the locations used don't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly. see battleground for a better take on this battle.
1,"""Worst Blu-Ray Transfer Ever!""","I was really excited to watch this one on Blu-Ray, hoping that it would be a clear and excellent presentation. About 15 minutes into the film, I could see a white haze on both sides of the picture. This continued in and out through the whole film,(in one scene, we view a train going through a tunnel at full speed, but it in the blackness, it actually looks like you're looking through a telescope at night) HORRID!The film itself..ditto, HORRID!"
2,Lump of coal in your stocking...,Big names + poor history + cartoon characters + pathetic dialogue = world war 2 garbage time. Avoid it.
2,not very authentic,"Gee guys, I'm not sure about this one: Wrong weather (it would seem that the Battle of the Bulge was fought in pleasant spring weather with just a bit of snow on the ground); Wrong tanks (the Americans use only M-24's and the Germans seem to have gotten a hold of an awful lot of M-26's...I know working Tigers and Panthers would have been hard to get a hold of, but come on! This is Hollywood! Couldn't they have worked their paper mache magic?); Mostly made-up story-line (uh, Elsenborn Ridge, Bastogne etc. weren't exciting enough?); Lame script (Fonda's is the only role that goes beyond two dimensional characterization); Ridiculous ending (Just in case you do decide to get this tape I won't ruin it for you). Skip this one and get Battleground (1949 I think)...a much better film about this battle with none of the above flaws."
2,A little more generous than Mr. Silva,"I think the actors from Robert Ryan and Henry Fonda try their best in this entertaining, but very muddled opus. In other respects, I have to agree with Mr. Silva, Bill Wellmnan's Battleground is a lot more accurate than this movie, and a lot better. This production of this motion seems to have been an unfortunate example of Hollywood laboring under the example that history could be rewritten and improved. In this case, they missed."
3,The Panzer Forces were led by who??,"Funny, I've never heard of Colonel Maertin Hessler, at least not in the context in which he was portrayed in the movie. Why would the Germans' 'finest panzer commander' be a colonel? Wouldn't he be some sort of field marshall? Oh well, once you get beyond oversimplification of the battle (the Ardennes battle was decided by more than simply fuel supplies), 'Battle of the Bulge"" is a frequently riveting and esciting movie. I watched it on the fourth of July in 1994, and there are parts missing from the VHS version I bought in 1998. Hessler, in the original version, shouts ""It can be done!"" When he sees the tiger tanks that have been made available for the offensive, making a massive ""Sieg Heil"" salute. Oh well. Watch this movie when it's raining; then you'll feel like you're really part of the action!"
3,Dated and unrealistic,"Compared to today's WW2 movies (Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, When Trumpets Fade), this film can't stand up to them. The acting may be excellent (Henry Fonda, the allied General and all the german crew), even outstanding. There are some gripping moments (the germans singing), but the overall script is really bad and unreallistic. The end is most horrible, credibility and suspension of disbelief drop below zero... I don't regret seeing this film, I might even buy it if ever released on DVD for my WW2 collection, but it is strictly for WW2 movie fans. The rest can skip to one of the aforementioned 3 movies."
4,"GOOD MOVIE, GOOD RENDITION!","Many reviews will state the historical inaccuracies of this movie and most are correct in their positions but if you remove that purist facet and look at this movie for itself and not in context to history you find a great movie built on the traditional theme set by most WWII movies, Good vs. BadIngenuity, courage and freedom outshine even the bleakest odds! obviously a little propaganda there but it truly defines this era and genre of film and thats what I like about them! The HD version takes an already great film and refreshes it to its original vision adding the clarity and sound that only hd media can do! If you like this type of film I strongly recommend this movie on HD-DVD!!!!"
1,One of the Worst WWII Movies,I agree with all the bad reviews. This is a terrible movie and does not honor those that won this battle. In the 80s I worked for a man that joined Patton's army on Dec 19th and was thrown into this battle and eventually wounded. He laughed about how far off from the actual conditions this movie is. Somone needs to do a remake of this along the lines of Band of Brothers. Save your money...
2,Bottle of the Bilge,"While Robert Shaw does a workmanlike job as a Waffen SS Battalion Commander, the writing and other actors are subpar. The historical accuracy of this movie leaves much to be desired although the Germans did desperately need to reach Allied fuel dumps to continue their offensive and this was a focal point of the plot buildup and climax. The special effects are worse than ordinary as the usual American tanks are used (M-48's to represent Tiger tanks) and M-41's to represent Shermans. The budget would not allow for realism. All in all, this movie is bilge."
4,DVD Please !,"This is a classic war movie. Though lacking historical realism, its still an enjoyable film. Lots of tanks anyway. Big name actors (Fonda, Bronson, Andrews, Shaw, Savalas, and the like). Not really about the real Battle Of The Bulge, it takes some of the events from that famous battle and remolds it into a kinda 'what-if' story about a German armoured spearhead that launches an attack to cut off Allied forces, to buy time to build the new jet aircraft and nuclear weapons and win the war. Names of characters are all fiction.What really disappoints me is that a lot of footage (at least 20 minutes worth) has been cut out from the original print. Please, Warner, release the FULL version on DVD!"
3,This one sort of falls apart...,"Although based upon one of the most recognized and remembered battles in World War 2, this movie just gets a little too ""hokey"" for my liking.Telly Savalas running around in a turretless tank, threatening to ""ram"" the German Panthers. The incorrect use of tanks that were not in the World War 2 inventory of either side. I don't even want to talk about the way that they portray Jochen Peiper, the commander of the German forces involved in ""Wacht Am Rhine"", the German code name for the Ardennes Offensive...I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.The movie is still enjoyable...and worth hanging out and watching on a rainy day. But save your money and buy ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Bridge at Remagen"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or ""The Great Escape""."
3,War Classics,"I have always like Classic War Movies, Even though the Story and the True History of this Battle is quiteDifferent, The Action is outstanding and the Actors are mostly Famous, Quite an actor listing.For folks who like war movies, this won comes close in second.RLT"
1,Nice try but no cigar,"This true story of very heroic men deserves better. Compaired with other pictures of this same epic battle this one left me with a very cheap, hollow, immitation feeling. Henry Fonda is very believable as an American officer. The american troops are largely portraied as poorly lead bafoons. The german troops are played by actual german actors. Their english is much to good and they lack an authentic feel. The battle scenes leave you with a hollow imatation feeling.John W."
2,Too Contrived to be Believable,"Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw and Robert Ryan are the only redeeming values of this loosely fact based story of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. While the overall story line is somewhat related to the real facts, the plot in this one is difficult to digest when compared to what really happened. What makes this hard to accept is the filming done at what had to be Fort Hood in Texas with all of its wide open spaces totally unlike the forests and mountains where the real battle was fought.The three actors mentioned did their best to salvage this thing with their legendary acting skills, but it was all wasted on the blown apart turret on a Sherman tank where the crew was intact and rushing to save the day.I find it much more believable to watch accounts of warfare replicated on film such as ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"". If you want to see the real Battle of the Bulge, Brothers does it in spades."
3,Henry Fonda,This is just an OK version of the Battle of the Bulge. There are other versions out there that are better.
4,Stitiches in motion- independent review,I have viewed this DVD as an independent person from Leisure Arts. The DVD is nicely done. Their are multitude of stiches in the index to review and knit along with the person on the DVD.Nicely done. This DVD provided reassurance that I was doing a few of these stitches the correct way. I would recommend the DVD to the beginner person wanting to learn new stitches.
5,SOOO GOOD!,knit stitches in motion is the most useful knitting resource in my library! it's so easy to follow along with...i really felt like i was knitting right next to the instructor. it's great for knitters of all levels and has tons of nifty extras=) i learned to do a five stitch cable soooo fast!!! love it!!!!!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Kirth Gersen has disposed of three of the five master criminals (orcorporate executives, if you like) that were involved in a massacrethat killed his family, among others. With three down, there are two togo, one being very tricky, and the other schizoid and very strange.There are girls to shag and competing killers to deal with on the way."
3,Science Fiction,"Quite enjoyable reading from an SF author with an incredible imagination, but not as good as the three stories in Volume which were worthy of a 5 rating."
1,"Has the French, at least.","I bought this volume for only two reasons, that it had the french with unobstrusive footnoted translations; and that it was cheaper than the fowlie.This has turned out to be quite a mistake. I had thought that ""Collected Poems"" meant that every known poem would be included. Well, this volume doesn't. I couldn't find avertissment (ces ecritures ci sont des un toute jeune homme...) anywhere in it, and wondered if it was by some other French author. I later found it in the Fowlie edition.If you have a good deal of French, this may not be too bad an introductory edition, but if you had any French, you'd want a complete edition. Don't buy this book."
1,Avoid,"It's a scandal that Penguin are keeping Oliver Bernard's lame translations in print. His are the worst translations of Rimbaud that I've ever read - lazy, limp and boring, and Rimbaud in French is _never_ boring.If you want a more-or-less complete and faithful translation of Rimbaud, try the Wallace Fowlie edition. But don't waste your money on Bernard."
3,"well, there are worse translations",though not the best translation i have read ... the Bertrand Mathieu translation cited below is by far the worst i have read. try the Paul Schmidt translation.
1,Penguin and Bernard (most notably) should be ashamed,"Without a doubt, Penguins Collected poems of Arthur Rimbaud is one of the most self-flatulent collaborations of any poet...this says nothing about Rimbaud, I believe Arthur was one of the most brilliant and furthermore inspirational poets of ANY time... But it is this anthology that has botched translations to the point of misrepresenting Rimbaud's Raucous and original voice, turning him into an Aristocrat of language when it is well know he was a vagabond, with a street smart vocabulary...furthermore, Rimbaud's poem Depart, was utterly underscored by Bernard's trnaslation, leaving out entire lines written by the poet.....if you need a better source for Rimbaud's work, refernce further A Season in Hell & Illuminations Translated by Bertrand Mathieu.....thank you and goodnight."
3,decent theory book,"This book offers an overview of current org. theory. Takes a strong interpretive stance, but good for getting theory down and being able to critique the theory."
3,The Sandal,"LOved the sandal, the look, the construction BUT- it was too wide for my ordinary size 9 foot! Sad!"
3,It's an OK product,"I have back problems and really need comfortable shoes. I bought these sandals because of excellent reviews. In terms of comfort they are OK, but as for looks... Well they are not very fashionable. I wear them for every day but not excited about them."
5,Wonderful,"I got this CD for the love theme from Four Weddings and a Funeral, which I had been searching for for years. Found the other music to be beautiful as well. This CD is perfect for a rainy afternoon with a glass of wine or a cup of tea. It's soothing and evocative. Wasn't aware of Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, but I am looking up more of his music now!"
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"I orderd this for ""Lady Caroline Lamb"" (Because the ""idiots that be"" don't recognise a superb score - & have not released the original soundtrack in this country).The performance is exemplary - Truly excellent. I like everything on this CD - But I'd still like to have the BEAUTIFUL ""Lamb"" soundtrack availabe in the US. This, a worthy preformance, is a welcome addition to any film score collection - Now let's have the original soundtrack!"
2,Bargain Bin Bait,"Plan B attempted to meld metal with alternative, the way many later, better bands did, but with much less success. They come off as a slightly cooler, hipper version of Guns & Roses, but when you get right down to it, who needs another G&N?"
5,Musica Cristiana,"This is the best Spanish-language Christian compilation I have ever heard. I was given the CD and have since bought it for most of my husband's family. The songs vary in style. My favorite is ""Cara a Cara"" by Marcos Vidal. I have another ""Directo al Espiritu"" CD, but ""2000"" is my favorite."
3,fun,"As far as costume jewlery goes, this is a fun piece. I always take my rings off when washing hands or putting lotions on to avoid destroying any metals (see previous review). I like the interchangeable bands. Fits true to size."
5,Cord,I needed a 14ft cord and couldn't find one. This was exactly what I wanted and what i needed. Thanks
4,Praxis for SLP,"This CD is helpful on a basic level for preparing for the Praxis exam for SLP's. I like that you can set it for varying levels of difficulty and may also be set in varying modes, such as beat the clock, computer assist mode in which it shows you the correct answer etc."
1,Want your hamster to escape? Then this is for you!!!,"We thought this looked like a really nice, great cage for our hamster, so we bought it. Unfortunately, the hamster could easily escape. She would just climb into the top portion, and push her head against the top, and the lid would pop right off. She would do this constantly; it was not a fluke.We found that we could use twine to tie the lid down so she couldn't escape, but really, this shouldn't be necessary for the product. It should be strong enough to withstand a tiny rodent pushing against the lid."
1,MemawofKarKayHudKat,"With a name like Hartz, I just knew it was going to be great...-WRONG!!!! None of the tubes hold together. Whatever you do, don't nudge, or even move slightly because something will come apart. I would never recommend. I have ended up taping the tubes together. Can you imagine the trouble one has to go thru to clean it. Everything has to be un-taped and then re-taped. Don't buy."
3,Hamster Escape Artist!!,I love the way this cage looks -- it is colorful and there are so many places for the little guy to explore! I bought this cage for my daughter's new hamster. He quickly figured out how to come out of the top hatch -- they are smart! We have been using another cage while I research how to stop this Houdini routine and its nice to know it wasn't the first hamster to figure this out. I selected this cage after we had cared for a friend's hamsters and they had every connection duct taped to prevent an escape. So... I suppose we just try to decide the best defense route and guard the exits.I am not fond of the connectors on this cage however; we purchased one of the supplement tube packages and when I placed the pieces on they almost fall off by themselves -- imagine with Houdini's weight. There wouldn't be an escape challenge -- where's the fun in that!?!
1,Dangerous!,"I was willing to put up with the poor quality reception for the convenience of the small size in my hobby room. However, when it quit working, I found that the plug was extremely hot and had begun to melt!! Since it was very close to a shelf that holds sewing fabrics, it could have been a real disaster and could have caused a fire. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!!!"
3,"Great Filer, but cheaper direct from AquaPure","The filter does what is is supposed to do - clean your water, so it gets 5 stars, but the price gets 0 stars, hence the 3 star rating.I am an Amazon Prime member, so I try to buy everything through Amazon. But they are charging $45.00 for this unit plus 5.99 for shipping.If you buy it direct from AquaPure's online site, it's only $35.96 plus 8.00 shipping."
1,This is not the ap815 filter,This is the lower model filter...the ap815 is supposed to be dark in color b/c it has activated carbon....this filter is just for sediment and is the ap810 most likely
3,First Reviewer!,Without a doubt an excelent work of Science Fiction-Fantasy. Well worth the time reading. I hope Mr. Farides someday takes the time to revise the series and make it even more detailed and interesting then it already is!
3,You get what you pay for...I guess....,"I bought this player as a gift for a friend. I own a JVC XV-501BK that's about two years old and twice as expensive. I didn't realize how nice my JVC was until I used this player. The load time of the disc is unusually long (maybe 15 seconds). What exactly is it loading here anyway? My JVC loads a disc in about 2 seconds.The button placement on the remote is a little unusual as well. The play button is in the top middle while the pause is at the bottom right?!?! At least it saves your stopping place when you hit stop (something my JVC doesn't do without hitting ""Resume"" first)......... I'd keep looking if I were you..."
2,What is that noise?,"Great price, but why does it make that noise? It would be great if the noise was actually the audio from the DVD, but it isnt. The noise this thing makes from spinning the DVD overpowers the audio completely. It also takes a long time to load and the display is very primitive looking. You DO get what you pay for."
4,First DVD,If you have never had a DVD before this is a great starter. It hooks right up to your surround system and the sound and picture quality are great for this price. I am very satisfied.
1,Fake,"""Package had dirty fingerprints all over and spray bottle was 3/4 full and I think it was used before and returned and resold. And it could also be a fake from China. """
2,Problem,After a few sprays the spray cologne would not spray. Had to break open the top and put in the regular cologne bottle when it ran out.
2,Immediate desired effect for adult using on office chair - then broke!,"Supports my spine, enables me to sit in the proper position very comfortably, virtually effortlessly. I can also do TA (abdominal) exercises while sitting, shift in my seat effortlessly, and keep my feet on the floor. It arrived rapidly, was easy to unpack, and was inflated at the perfect level for me. I am so pleased that i am purchasing another one. Wish that I had known about this sooner. Addendum: the wedge split 1/4"" along a seam after less than 2 months on use in my computer chair. Amazon agreed to refund the money when I sent it back. What a hassle! This product should have lasted for years. : ("
4,Great for a wiggly preschooler!,"The small 10"" wedge works great for my little boy. It fits perfectly on his school chair. It allows him to wiggle a bit in his seat, while working on a project at school. It is also very helpful when we are out for lunch or dinner. Works great for a child that has SI Issues/Disorders, SPD, ADD or ADHD."
2,Butt muscle exercise not from this product,prior issues of this product were made of what appeared as a soft rubber base that was supple and cushy. This one is made of a harder plastic composition and is reinforced by a hard back - these two qualities make it less fluid when you sit on it. The fluidity is what i had hoped to purchase.
5,"love it, wish I had found it sooner","I have a 2 1/2 year old with a developmental disability, and as a result she is hypotonic. She cannot yet get into seated on her own. I have been trying to work on her ab muscles with various exercises but to no avail (no motivation). I stumbled upon this online and couldn't be happier. within minutes of seating her on it so she was sitting forward going against the slope she commented that her tummy was sore - meaning, it is working to isolate those muscles. I wish I had found this long, long ago!"
5,Excellent for wiggle worms,We use these for our kids at school and keep one in the car for restaurant. They are a good price for a great quality product. I highly recommend buying two if you are buying one becasue you will like it so much.
1,BAD BAD SELLER,DO NOT USE THIS SELLERI purchased a Cando vesicular wedge for my special needs child who finds it difficult to sit still. The item arrived defective and would not stay inflated. Despite leaving messages and emails with the seller they would not return my phone calls or answer my emails.I am sure if your product is of good quality you will be happy but to take the risk of getting something defective and being ignored and not getting your money back is despicable.
3,"Helpful tool, but a little over priced.","This cushion is a helpful tool for our child, but we wish they were a little cheaper. The material seems sturdy, but can easily be punctured. Not sure how long this will last from daily use."
5,Kitchy Girl Works It,"I purchased this for my son as a fan of the Fallout series. Through out the game you see a similar hula girl used as decorations, a throwback to the 50's. He loved it!"
1,Too Top Heavy,Dashboard Doll Hula Girl did not stick to the dashboard. it often toppled over. It appears to be too top heavy. Would not recommend.
2,UUUUUUUUHHH???? WHAT?,"Warning Kool Keith Fans. This may be rare release, but it sounds like club-pop-commercial stuff (you know that stuff that wont get off the radio for a month, but then is never heard again). Not that that is an entirely bad thing but I'm a die-hard Kool Keith fan, and I draw the line here. I just got it in the mail not more than 20 minutes ago, popped it in, and here I am warning the world Paul Revere style. If I could do it over, I would not buy this. I'm a crate digger, so I'll probably hold onto it for that reason. But unless you have stuff like Sean Paul, Destiny's Child (I'm not kidding) and Nelly in your collection; Beware. Or maybe you are just extremely open-minded/excepting, then go for it."
1,"Feels great, but falls asleep quickly (Mac OSX)","I'm using (or WAS using) the mouse on Mac OSX 10.4, and while the tracking feels fine, and the weight is fine once you get used to it, the mouse has an odd quirk. As a bluetooth mouse, it falls asleep when not used to conserve battery life. That's all well and good if you're away from your computer for hours at a time. When the mouse falls asleep within a minute or less of not being touched though, you have a problem. I'll be doing Photoshop work or browsing the internet or what have you, and I'll go to the mouse, only to have it 'wake up' for a second until it responds. It is very aggravating. There is no support from Logitech on OSX so you can't really get into any of the configuration settings. Even under Windows XP in Bootcamp, I was unable to find a way to turn off this 'sleep mode.' I'm sure you can find better for the price whether you're working on a Mac or PC."
5,Philip Johnson at his best!,"Johnson, the brillant architect that he was, is at his best in the ""Eccentric Architect."" Entertaining, engaging and informative, this DVD shows the human side of Johnson and how his extrordinary life shaped his rich architectural legacy."
3,Not quite as expected,"The book was in good condition but was not Like New as was advertised. There were creases, tears and yellowed pages, but otherwise was in good order. Book was packaged well and arrived very quickly. Worth the price that was paid. Would buy from this vendor again."
2,Born To Sing purchase.,"I was excited about purchasing Born to Sing. Once the parcel arrived I opened it right away. I received the Born To Sing book; the 4 CD's well, that's different story they weren't with the Born to Sing booklet. The CDs were my main reason for the Born To Sing purchase."
4,Great coverage of basic singing techniques,"This pack gives excellent coverage of the basics of good singing techniques. Although I've been singing for a while, it's always useful to have a guide to refer to, making sure the technique is good. This guide makes it easy to check and I've found I'm already singing with better resonance and breathing."
2,Born to Sing,"Some good advice (breath control, etc) for the beginner, but little in the way of achieving harmony, correct pitch, achieving good tone, etc. Comes with a pocket sized book that is probably better than the accompanying CD."
1,"Wow.....this one actually ""hurt"" to listen to","I'm sitting here, going through old voice training tapes we've purchased. I actually logged onto Amazon, to specifically enter this note; because, listening to either Elisabeth Howard and/or Howard Austin is so painful, that, I wanted to note it for anyone about to purchase this.Don't do it. Stylistically, they are so out of touch with anything current; and, their pitch control is, well, terrible.Buy anything else; but, don't buy this one."
3,Misled,"First I received the camera and found an oversea's power adaptor in the box, and without a converter to use it! Upon numerous phone calls and emails, the converter was sent to me, but not without making me feel like I overlooked such a detail when purchasing it. After having it for a short time I am not real pleased with the pictures-either they are too dark or too washed out (or too bright). I am not sure if I am really that camera-illiterate or the camera is not working properly. So far, I have not been happy with this camera."
2,Leo,I would say I was also misled... with an overseas adapter. Need less to say... it should CLEARLY designate the product if that's what is being sold! I had to buy a universal adapter from Radio Shack.At this point; the camera seems to work fine.
2,incorrect demensions,"This item would have been perfect for my cutlery drawer! Except that in the product description it says this item is ""about 16 inches long"" when it is actually over 17 inches long.... my kitchen drawer is 16.5 inches long. The other dimensions were true to product."
2,Cheap thin plastic,The plastic for this drawer was cheap and very thin. If you're expecting rubbermaid-type thicker construction you will be disappointed.
4,Welcome To The Jungle,"A well-written, fast read that's pure fun. I travel a lot and read tons of books--everything from the classics to theB-listers. Not that this author is a B-lister--far from it. Sometimes a foray into virtual unknowns uncovers some gems, ""Jungle of Glass"" is one and to call it ""escapist"" is a compliment. The detective is Ed Rogan, a Brooks Brothers-suited gumshoe from New York who takes a trip down to El Salvador to sweat in the jungle. Hired to find some kidnappers, he winds up being shot at in a lingerie shop. The story is a grand hoot with snappy dialog, shady characters, and loose women. I couldn't put it down."
1,will not fit all,"I was hoping it would be soft and fit comfortably as the other hat I bought from Peter Grimm. It did not, so I can not wear it. It is too small and gives me a head ache.The other hat I wore for 6 years and was comfortable from day 1 and up until it wore out.I really hate I can not wear this new hat, seems as though it is made from concrete,"
4,Egg lifiting super-fun rocket,"To really impress your friends, launch a raw egg in this rocket, and get it back unbroken! This is a crowd favorite at any of my outreach launch demonstrations. (Especially the kid-2-kid egg toss after the flight to prove the egg is raw.) This rocket kit is one of the easiest to build egg-carriers on the market. It will fly on really small fields with a B6-2 size motor, and impresses best when flown on the C6-3. It is a very good group project type rocket, for 4H, YMCA, schools and scouts. And it can be used as a training round for any of the TARC contest teams (Team America Rocketry Challenge) or other groups out there. It will teach basic assembly skills, and instills correct flight preparation technique. And you can serve brunch after flying with and egg-stronaut omelet."
5,Very nice,I bought these to go into whisky barrels and they fit almost all the way down to the lip.... I'll be using them for regular planters haven't filled em up yet but when I do I'll let ya know
2,I tried to like it...I really tried.,"Did you ever rush out and buy a CD just because you heard one song and absolutely loved it? ""Cuts you up"" was that song, and since I remembered Peter Murphy from the early goth days, I figured how could I go wrong? Well guess what. The CD sucks. It really sucks. It created a black hole of suckitude in my living room and sucked me in to the land of sucktopia where I was forced to read the glowing reviews by a bunch of suckups who fawned all over the meaningful lyrics and ethereal melodies. I came back to my senses, shut off the CD player, and hung my head in resignation that once again I have wasted my hard earned money on one song. Now don't get me wrong, I have given it a few listens and still reach the same conclusion- ""cuts you up"" is a great song- surrounded by pretentious filler. Apparently alot of people enjoyed this CD. More power to them. But I failed to notice that there were also 63 used ones for sale. This one will be number 64."
5,Incredible Album,"So moody. Peter Murphy is amazing. The musicians on this album are solid and Peter Murphy's lyrics are mesmerizing. Dark, yet mature. This album does not get old."
5,Gothic Greatness,"Peter Murphy achieved greatness with this album. Sure, he'll always be remembered by most for his time with Bauhaus, and rightfully so. But this CD is his pinnacle as a musician and songwriter. He captures the essence of gothic music, the feeling of hope in the middle of hopelessness, passion inspired by sadness, the sense that life is so beautiful and should be cherished. It's one of my favorite CDs and has been for many years."
4,"Great album, couple of rough spots - one amazing single","The best single on the disk is ""Cuts You Up"". The rest of the album is pretty tight, both lyrically and musically. The last two tracks on the CD were the ones I had the most trouble interacting with. I think it is the finest of the albums Mr. Murphy has put out since he left Bauhaus, although ""Cascade"" is a very close second."
4,pretty good but too much English used on CD,I am using this on my own in preparation for college level Arabic classes and so far it's been pretty helpful re: pronunciation but the narrator's voice on the CD grates upon my nerves and the English instructions are too drawn out (thus less time for Arabic). The book itself is good because it has large type and flashcards you can cut out. My main quibble with the book: ugly graphics. Overall it is very helpful but it's not enjoyable to listen to ... unlike Pimsleur.
5,fascinating,"Pair this with ""The Silk Road"" by John S. Major. This book includes tales, legends, creation myths, poem songs, and riddles - all of them with an Oriental flavor and the kind of illustrations that set the scene for something very different. Beautiful map."
4,Great headphones,"These headphones have excellent sound. They are the best sounding headphones that I have ever seen at this size. Although they are a bit pricey, I would still reccomend them. The only downpoint is that sometimes they shift around on your ears. Once you figure out how to adjust them though, they should stay on pretty well."
5,Magnifique =),These are the best headphones I have ever used. The sound quality is superb and they are so comfortable. The cord in the back makes your neck kind of itchy because there's this thing around the rubber part. It's much louder than other headphones so I don't have to turn my CD player to an extremely high volume to hear it on the bus. I urge you to buy these headphones if you are thinking about it.
4,Great Headphones,"These headphones are wonderful. They are capable of getting quite loud, which is undeniably necessary. Another pro is the bass; they produce a ton of bass, another absolutely necessary feature. The fit, furthermore, is great. Finally, the cord is fabric like, another wonderful thing.There are two cons that make me remove a star. One is that the cord is far too long. It gets tangled very easliy, so beware. The other problem is that the spring mechanism breaks (or so I've heard).I've noticed that some people have a problem with fitting them. Here's how I get them to fit snugly.-Open the part that goes behind your ear up completely-Put as much of it behind your ear as possible-Spin the speaker part back to its normal positionIf this is of no assistance, I'm sorry. I have ears that stick out like the wings of a jet :). It may just be me who can get them to fit like that."
1,Look Elsewhere for Scholarship Info,"While this reader has been very pleased with Princeton Review materials in the past (especially 331 Best Colleges and the AP Exam Series,) this book is basically useless for practical scholarship information. Yes, it has a massive index of scholarships, but to qualify for them, you have to be a female from North Dakota who is a member of a specific school district, parish, the National Guard, and is attending some college in Florida. (OK, an exaggeration, but this book has 277 scholarship listings for Valencia Community College...277...) In short, very few, if any scholarships will apply to a normal student While there are many excellent scholarship info books out there, look beyond The Scholarship Advisor."
4,A Solid Piece of Equipment,"Have to agree with the comment that the reverse switch sometimes goes to neutral instead of where you want it. Except for this, what you have here is a typical DeWalt tool: a professional-grade, well-made, powerful workhorse you will find yourself using constantly. Pricey, but buy with confidence . . . and use DeWalt drill bits to maintain the integrity of the tool."
4,Commander Hamilton,Early 1990's Peter Stormare at his best. Great action from a GREAT author Jan Guillou. Always been my favorite swedish actor.
1,Skip it . . .,"The first 20 minutes of this Swedish (dubbed) film is respectable enough, but then it turns graphically brutal and nasty. It's listed as 'Not Rated'. Deceptive. Doesn't deserve even one star."
2,bloodless,"i do not understand why each book on dandridge is un able to paint a more interesting picture of this fascinating yet tragic woman, her story has it all! so heres hoping a writer comes along and can give this goddess her just due- because frankly this isn't it."
5,Kurt Bestor - Inspired Christmas Music,"Kurt provides a very listenable style and a unique update to a series of classic Christmas tunes. Very nice orchestrations, with violins, oboes, etc. Absolutely beautiful acoustic sounds and interesting harmonies on many numbers. Get this one and enjoy it for the holidays."
2,Excellent,"I really enjoy listening to Kurt Bestor and this CD in particular. It's one of my favorites. I noticed someone had a different opinion. I guess we're all entitled to our own opinion. Punk rockers for example - probably not going to like this one...Somehow my stars showed up as 2. Ooops. I'd rate it a 10+Hey Amazon, How about posting a few clips."
4,"Great Christmas music - but not ""fully orchestrated""","I love Bestor's music - it is solid, usually relaxing new age music that only occasionlly slips into becoming elevator music. However, I wish he'd stop using the terms ""fully orchestrated"" to describe his albums. It seems that for him that term means 1 or 2 pianos, 2 or 3 keyboards/synth, 2 or 3 percussionists and an occasional brass or string instrument thrown in. That, my friends, is not an orchestra!Oh, and the other reviewers are right, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without this CD."
3,POOR END TO WHAT STARTED A GREAT SERIES.,"By far out of story, Superman 4 The Quest for Peace was the weakest of the four films. The main problem with Superman 4 was the dramatic cutting made on the movie. The original running time was 134 mins, but it was knocked down to a disappointing 90 mins cause the 134 min version didn't do to well in a screening. It possible that a screening never took place and the story was never actually finished so they made did with what they had.Cause of its terrible cuts, the story appears to jump and some voice overs can be seen in the film. I beleive that if Superman 4 remained at its 134 min version, Superman 4 would have been a far greater success. According to film resources the extra footage no longer exists. But there was budget restrictions on Superman 4 which is why it was totally filmed at Pinewood Studios.Superman 4 The Quest for Peace actually feels more like a TV movie than an epic blockbuster.A poor end to what started out as a great series of films."
3,"Superman IV was okay, but could have been better.","Superman IV was definately not the best of the series, but it was okay. It suffered from the lack of the right people to make it. It was just plain cheesy. However, the plot of it was good. Superman was only trying to free the world of nuclear weapons as he was asked of, but Lex Luthor's nuclear man just got in the way. Aside from the horrible filmmaking, the plot is basically Superman. However, I would recommend it."
2,Superman 4 could be improved with new special effects.,"When I saw Superman 4 in the movie theater,the audience groaned at the poor special effects.One of the reasons for the poor effects is the budget cuts made to the film from US$36 million to only US$19 million.Also the Salkind's,producers of the first 3 films,refused to lend the studio the effects equipment that they developed for the Superman films after the studio had bought the rights to make the film from them(one of the great double-crosses in film history).The Salkinds had also previously double-crossed Marlon Brando by writing him out of Superman 2 to avoid paying contracted fees,so they were known for this.But the film's script on Superman getting rid of all nuclear weapons was a good idea and,if new special effects were added,it would improve this film greatly.Footnote...I noticed one crowd scene at the end of the movie seemed badly directed and wondered why,until I checked the second-unit director.....an inexperienced Christopher Reeve!"
1,Superman IV: The Failed Quest for Redemption,"I've been told that this movie suffered so much because of the 45 minutes that were cut from it and the special effects that were never finished due to budget cuts. This film should never have been released ""as is"". It looks cheap, the editing made it so the story makes no sense, and it is aimed solely for the purpose of entertaining small children. I can understand wanting to make up for Superman III, but this was a total failure in that respect. Stick with the expanded versions of the first two films and try to forget that the last two were ever made."
1,What a FLOP!,People who enjoy Superman 4 are idiots or don't have a life and deserve to be beaten for liking this movie. Superman 4 should be banned out of the series for good. It's ok for kids to enjoy this movie because they don't know the meaning of movies yet but for those who are older and have a brain of movies and enjoy this piece of crap you have no life at all. I'm 14 years old and know the meaning of movies and I don't like Superman 4 it sucks and the special effects are crap. Superman 1 and 2 rocks! Stay away from 3 and 4 they don't belong in the series.
3,"Nice try, Superguy!",Superman must defeat Atomicman. Not much else. A valiant attempt to revive the sagging Superman series.
1,Bad Filmmaking,"I like movies based on comic books. Let me make that perfectly clear. I loved Superman I and II, Blade, and even X Men, and I rush out to see every new comic book adaptation even if it's gotten bad reviews.I wish I'd stayed home when this one came out, though... The plot, while not awful, is not terribly original. I can cope. It's a comic book movie. I don't demand much in terms of plot. What I can't accept is when a movie is filmed and edited like a series of loosely connected comic book panels, without even the Wonder Woman-style captions to say ""hey, we did this on pourpose"". It looks like the director went to the storyboard meetings, then filmed exactly what was on the storyboard panels and not one single frame more.The result is an extremely choppy, disjointed mess, with performances that might as well have been done by the actors' stunt doubles, for all you can see of their personalities. A first-year cosmetology student could have done a better job of directing this mess."
3,A Definite Improvement Over the Last One,"To say the very least, I injoyed this film a lot more than I did Superman III. But still, it was no where near as close as the first two. It was enjoyable to see Gene Hackman reprise his role as Lex Luthor, and see Lois Lane become a dominate character again. And it's always been worth while to see Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman/Clark Kent. But the film rips off too much stuff from the first two Superman movies. And the special effects are out dated to say the least. One also has to wonder why they jumbled all the plot twists into this one story. But anyone who still loves Superman will probably like this film, which does mean well."
2,Superman 4 was not very good,What in the world were they thinking when they wrote this script???I'm glad that Christopher Reeve came back as Superman and I'm glad that Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor but bassicaly they could have made this movie a bit more serious.For all you Superman fans out there this is definatley a movie that you'll have to laugh at because of its storyline.
3,Favret Movies I Like.,1978: Superman 1980 Superman 2: 1983: Superman 3: 1987: superman 4: The Quest For Peace. Starring: Christopher Reeve Gene Hackman Margo Kidder: As Lois Lane. Lex Luthor.
1,Please..even Superman looks bored in this flim.,"I didn't even wanna give it 1 star but I had too, it wouldn't go less..How pittafull can u get man!!! Did they sleep walk through the movie. I swear every good movie the producer leaves or gets fired then some dork gets to take over like he knows what hes doing..If u make a movie this bad u might as well kill Superman..At least that would be some awww in it.Man I already miss Superman 1 and 2"
1,Superman IV flys in the toilet,"Who could have thought there was a worse sequel than Part III. Aside from nice performances from Margot Kidder and Reeve, this one should never have been made. With shoddy FX and a stupid supporting character from Jon Cryer, this has crass commercialism written all over it. It lacks the wit, irony, and thrills the first two had. Hell, it lacks some much needed effects part III had. Overall, a waste of talent and viewers time."
2,Super Flop 2,"Superman 4, Superman 4, hmmmmmmmmmm. I just don't know WHY THEY CAN'T HAVE SOME DIGNITY FOR THE MAN! This was MAYBE a little better than S-Man 3, but man, do we hafta? The special effects in this movie was superbad, the villian superlame (it's been done already.), the actors seemed like they just wanted to do the gig and collect a paycheck. God bless Chris Reeve though. He could've bailed out on a fourth film and left us with a REAL stinker. The fact that he's in it with a villian more credible than a COMPUTER is the only thing that gets this one 2 stars. (By the way, that reviewer from New York needs to be put under for giving this one 5 stars) C'mon Man! you know better."
2,A LITTLE BETTER THAN SUPERMAN 3 BUT NOT BY MUCH,I found SUPERMAN 4 THE QUEST FOR PEACE to be a little better than SUPERMAN 3 but not by much. It seems to me like CHRISTOPHER REEVE looked bored in this film kinda like his heart wasn't in it at all and he acts it too unfortunately. I also did'nt go for the villan in this story either NUCLEAR MAN? please!!! my 3 year old cousin could've probably come up with something better. The only thing that keeps this film from being a total disaster is GENE HACKMAN as wily LEX LUTHOR otherwise this film would be even worse than it's predecessor so all in all I can't recommend SUPERMAN 4 THE QUEST FOR PEACE.
1,"Terrible!!! Not one of the better ""Superman"" sequels!","I have to agree with the people who gave their opinion on ""Superman IV"". This one is just not right at all! I mean, the filmmakers of this one should not have wasted all that time or money on trying to make this fourth installment. I do like the fact that they brought back Gene Hackman again for the role of Lex Luthor, but this is just not right! The special effects in this are very, very cheesy! And the 90 minute run time in this film is just plain sick!! It's nice to see Christopher Reeve back for the 4th time as the Man of Steel and also Margot Kidder as Lois Lane as well. But now, Mariel Hemingway steps into the picture, and all of a sudden, we've got a love triangle going on here! But like I said, the filmmakers wasted their time on this. They should have sat this one out."
3,Additional scenes make movie much better...,"Ok, we all know that Superman 4 sucks. Nuclear man was ridicoulous, Superman preforms ridicoulous actions, and it's boring.However, there are some good scenes that were deleted from all previous DVD Releases. This has the first nuclear man (the one on the cover is actually Nuclear Man2), who resembled Bizarro in every way. Seeing him in the deleted scenes really made me happy I went and bought this movie.All in all, the movie isn't very good, but the deleted ones are, and Gene Hackman is always great as Lex Luthor as Christoper Reeves was Superman. If only they had a better budget and never made Nuclear Man2, because he sucked bigtime.To all Bizarro fans; buy this movie."
1,something weird happened,"I remember seeing this film in the theater and didn't think it was all that bad, at first, and then somewhere around the 70 minute mark there seems to be a lack of continuity and bang - all the action and special effects in one fell swoop and the end of the movie in 20 minutes. After leaving the theater I had the distinct feeling that the movie had been cut by about 30 minutes. Of course, a 120 minute film is not that unusual so I suspected that the film was even worse so they had no choice but to cut it up. Don't buy this film unless you've just got to have a complete set...heck, even Superman 3 was better than this one!"
2,"Deluxe Edition worth a rent for commentary, deleted scenes","I bought the 14-disc ""Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition"" which includes the new Deluxe Edition of Superman IV. If you didn't go for the collector's edition, in my opinion this movie is not worth buying -- it is as bad as you've heard. But the new Deluxe Edition, released by Warner Bros. on Nov. 28, 2006, is worth a rent: watch it with the audio commentary by co-screenwriter Mark Rosenthal, who is very forthright regarding the production problems this movie faced, that ultimately contributed to its failure. Also interesting to look at are the deleted scenes, if only as a curiosity. Most of them certainly deserved to be cut but there are two or three that aren't too bad. The two deleted scenes involving the ""first"" Nuclear Man (who was completely absent from the final cut) are worth a chuckle - or a groan - for the completely cheesy electronic music that plays whenever he's on screen."
3,"Poor film, Lots of deleted scenes!","Even though this is the silliest superman sequel, for a true and loyal superman fan this dvd is a must-have. Of all the recently released superman deluxe editions this one has the most deleted scenes of all. You get to see half an hour of scenes never seen before, some of which are pretty good. I like the extended flying scene and a typical Clark Kent's morning. The alternate version of Nuclear Guy looks very ugly and dumb. Thank God Mark Pillow ended playing it in the final cut. There are more fight scenes that were deleted and overall the studios really packed a good deluxe edition."
5,HAVE YOU ALL HEARD OF ORIGINAL 134 MIN. VERSION OF THIS FILM,I VE SAW A MUCH LONGER VERSION OF THIS FILM WHEN I WAS 17.IT WAS ON A DEFUCNT NETWORK CALLED THE SFM HOLIDAY NETWORK.IF YOU COULD VE SEEN THIS VERSION YOU WOULD LIKE THIS FILM.
1,Superman IV: The Craps for Pee,"I found 3 reasons to hate this movie3. You can't watch Superman Returns if you watch this.2. Nuclear Man, they had Bizzaro in the movie but they replaced him with a blond haired weirdo that never even appered in the comic adaption.and 1. Weak plot, it sounded like a good plot for a 60's Batman movie sequal (I still want a DVD release of the TV show though) but not for a Superman movie. Sorry Christopher Reeve (He made the Plot) it's just too campy for even Adam West's Batman.Though I can't wait until the NEW Superman Movie for 2009, do NOT watch this movie."
1,Mariel Hemming way can breathe in space,"Ok, where do I begin.The story is weak and stupid. The villian is laughably ridiculous.You could feel the budget cut is was that bad.The fight on the moon scene, black curtains where used. Wires sticking out to make hero and villian fly exposed.Superman rebiulds the wall of China with his eyes, just simple camera work for budget costs.My fav part, nuclear man takes Mariel Hemmingway's character into space.Yup, past the thin air, the intensly hot atmosphere and she is ok.I don't mind good ""bad"" movies, but this is just BAD bad.Not even worth watching for free.Avoid this clunker."
1,Directors Cut please!!!!!!,"So, I got this to see all the deleted footage. Well, they could have restored the footage... Unfinished special effects?! Come on WB, fans have waited a long time to see this footage, and we get unfinished scenes? Give us Superman IV with all the scenes restored and put back in the movie as it was intended to be. Give it 5.1 surround audio. I hate watching movies that sound like I Love Lucy episodes. I rated this a 1 based on the movie content and sound quality, not on Superman and Christopher Reeve. Will Superman IV ever get a restored Extended/Directors Cut with 5.1 audio?"
4,Not all bad,"A lot of negative stuff has been said about the Superman IV movie. But unfortunately many reviewers overlook the good points too. First of all, the musical score is wonderful, and it is mind boggling why the soundtrack has not been released, especially since the composer is Alexander Courage. OK, so the special effects need work. You can tell they're dollies when Superman and Nuclear Man are flying around the Earth. But the heat-ray/lasers used for Nuclear Man's power are wonderful. And remember folks, Gene Hackman did the voice for Nuclear Man, not Mark Pillow. So all that awful dialogue cannot be the burden of Pillow alone. It would be a truly great movie if they included all cut footage and spruced up the special effects. The great sound and music is already there."
4,"""Superman IV: It Shouldn't Have Ended Here!""","Although the film lacked because of the special effects, and the crude editing, I regard it as one of my favorites in the series! It's great because all the other cast members from the first 2 films come back to reprise such brilliant roles! Christopher Reeve's story idea for the film in regards to nuclear weapons was very interesting, and it's the core of everything that Superman stands for! Still I hated the series to have ended like this, and I felt they should made a better film where they all say good-bye to each other! Warner Brothers can try, but they can never replace Christopher Reeve, or any of the other actors!"
2,Chernobyl and Other Nuclear Disasters,"'Superman IV - The Quest for Peace' released in '87 was an absolute bomb (yes, pun intended). Christopher Reeve still looked the part, but it was obvious that the fun of being a superhero had worn thin.TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY? For completist only."
1,WORST FILM OF ALL TIME!,I saw this film on television recently and it was the most frightening and disturbing experience of my life. By far the best horror masterpiece ever contrived. I am still suffering the after affects. This straightjacket is bloody tight!
3,Superman is no superman,I really can't see how superman can be called superman in this movie. The whole moon scene with superman fighting nuclear man is totally one sided. Nuclear man totally knocks out superman 3 times on the moon. Once when he smashes supermans head into the rock. Another time when he strikes superman with 18 electric blasts and then when superman hurts his head when he flys into nuclear man allowing nuclear man to pick superman up over his head in a bench press style and hammer him into the dirt. Nuclear man also back hands superman many times during the movie totally knocking superman off his feet.
5,The Best of the Series,Superman IV has done the impossible and created a super film on a modest $15 million budget. The most sincere performance from Christopher Reeve is in this movie. The music in this film is in my opinion the BEST in the series...yes even better than the first. Alexander Courage (with help from John Williams) did an amazing job. There are as many GOOD f/x too... I hate it when people critisize the F/X ...when one uses a cost factor for the F/X then one could argue that this film has the BEST F/X of the series. Thank you Mr Reeve for making Superman IV. This will always be my favourite Superman movie and I'll always defend it. I'd love to see the missing 45 minutes someday. Warner are u listening ?
1,absolutely atrocious,"Well the've done it again, made a great comic book story into a pile... This movie is about as bad as Karate Kid Three. Lets see, whats wrong with it--well EVERYTHING! I don't know where to begin, with Lex's far-fetched escape out of prison, normal people flying in space, getting rid of all the nuclear missles by putting them into the sun, and of course our villian, thats right, where did they find this guy, some... solar senisitve villian that came from the sun--brilliant! First of all, don't cast John Cryer for anything, yeah, I'm sure his performance as Lex's son was probably the finest in his short an completely unknown career. Hackman, what were you thinking, this movie should have ended your career. For future refenece, when you get a script like this, DON'T TAKE IT!!! ... Well, this is by far the worst flick(I won't even call it a movie, let alone a film) I've ever seen."
2,Super-Disappointment,"Let's face it: while it was great seeing Chris Reeve as Superman, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, et. al. once again, nothing they did could save this movie from its awful production standards, crummy dialogue and disjointed plot. The subplot of Superman ridding the world of nuclear bombs was terrific, but it was downhill after that. Plus the movie isn't original: the sequences between Clark and Lois essentially are a repeat from ""Superman I""; Luthor's super-villian is reminiscent of the Phantom Zone escapees from ""Superman II"". The definitely cheesy special effects make this a sad farewell to Chris Reeve as The Man of Steel. One thing, though: there is an incredible flying & landing sequence near the end, where Superman speaks to the Press near the U.N. This is one of the few special effects that make it look like Superman is really doing his thing!"
2,Superman IV the quest for whatever,"I have to echo the other reviewers, this is by far the worst of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, however to complete the collection I purchased this one. There could have been so much more done with this movie. I do think Gene Hackman as Luthor was an act of genius- he is the perfect mix of likable and hateable."
2,POOR EFFECTS AND LAMENTABLE EDITING SINK IT; CGI RESTORATION,"The script for this third sequel is actually a good read, and imagining how it could have looked while reading it makes one cringe when seeing the final product. According to Jon Cryer(Lenny Luthor), the film was released before post-production even really was underway, so it's no wonder that the effects are so terrible. They aren't finished! They are in the film exactly as they looked on the sets, which is very fake(even Star Wars and Raiders would have looked phony if the post-production work was never completed). A CGI restoration would literally work a miracle. It would turn the worst film in the series into at least the third best, and if visually stunning, maybe the best(doubtful, but who knows). The actors are all good, and the basic story is clever. C'mon, Warners, do a CGI Restoration, and salvage this film! Give us a farewell to the Christopher Reeve series that we can be proud of, rather than one that makes us cringe!"
1,Superman IV: The Quest For A Better Movie,"Illogical, truncated mess of a movie, subpar effects, Gene Hackman returned for what?, to collect a paycheck, watching Laci fly through the space with Nuclear Man without any protective gear tells you all you need to know about this movie. So much talent wasted in this movie, it shouldn't have been greenlighted or released. A star goes to Reeve for being a trooper. Absolutely abysmal."
1,Bad way to finish it up,"To close the Superman series out with this movie was a very sad testamony to the Superman movies. Christopher Reeve insisted on doing these ultra-liberal themes (anti-nuke, anti-strong military, anti-development, anti-corporation development, etc.). It made for a bad story. Add to that the INCREDIBLY BAD editing, this movie was horrible. I remember seeing it in the theaters and thinking - How did we get to this scene? Was that badly edited or is it me?Skip this movie all together. If you have Superman and Superman II, you have the two Superman movies worth owning."
2,Sad ending to the Reeve Superman,"I think the most frustrating thing about this movie is that it could have been so much better. If you look at the movie in the context of the time in which it was created, late 80's when their really was a nuclear arms race, this movie could have really done a lot to help children understand the desperate need to handle this nuclear problem. Instead all Writers for this movie could come up with was, ""lets have every country that has nuclear weapons shoot them into the air so Superman can get them and throw them into the sun.""As usual I did like the cast which is what saved the movie from 1 star. Gene Hackman was great as Luthor, Christopher REeve is Superman! I love his portrayal of Clark. Mariel Hemingway makes a great female lead in this movie. I wish that she had been cast Lois instead of Kidder.Unless you just have to complete the Superman series in your collection I would leave this Superman alone."
1,Brialliant? I hardly think so!,"To the guy who gave this movie 5 stars and said it was ""Brilliant"": Get a clue when a person makes a mistake. It's not Lucy, it's Lacy but that doesn't make the movie any better. This movie was terrible and I have to agree with the guy from Sacramento that this movie swallowed big time! There's so much inconsistancy and obvious, predictable scenes in this movie. It was over before it began!"
4,Good classic,"I believe Christopher Reeve was the best Superman, even for the new ones that preceeded his character the decades after."
5,Episodes on this DVD are:,4 episodes on this DVD are:It's a Bugs WorldDiego the HeroAlicia and Whitetail to the rescueWhistling Willie finds a buddy
5,Brushfire,"Beautiful, Interesting and Haunting. Really makes you think about the bad side of judeo christian beliefs."
3,Amazing Artwork / Poor Presentation,"As the title of my review says, the artwork by Barlowe is amazing, but Brushfire fails to deliver in the presentation. At least his art isn't in black & white like some art books, but the generic textured background is thoughtless and amateur. The single most irritating aspect of this folio is that some of the art falls across the spine. Although I am somewhat disappointed, I'm happy to finally have some of Barlowe's work in my small library."
2,"Image matches title, but it's of a different CD","I love it when owners include images of the liner notes, etc. but the one shown does not match the CD in terms of content. The song titles & artists listed below this entry are different than the ones in the image. The only thing in common is the title, which obviously refers to a different CD. If you order this CD, you might want to contact the seller to make sure you are getting the one you want/expect."
4,Build confidence,"Michele Thomas continues with mastery of Italian verbs. The students in this course have clearly been studying ahead of time. Sometimes they know the answers so easily, the listener doesn't have a chance to think of the answers. A very good grammatical structure course, but work on vocabulary building would be essential for conversation."
2,Italian With A Garbled German Accent,"Michel Thomas is an accomplished linguist I'm sure, but he should have had someone else speak for him on these CDs. After listening to his voice you'll just wish he would CLEAR HIS THROAT! He can't help it, but I found myself avoiding the CDs because it was hard sometimes to understand him. I hate to waste $50 Dollars so I think I will donate them to my local Library."
1,If you want to speak Italian with a German accent this is for you,Nowhere does it tell you that this teacher is speaking Italian with a very thick German accent and there is no native speaker anywhere in these lessons. Most of your time is spent listening to his 2 students struggling to find the correct pronunciation and sentence structure. He lets them go on way too long to the point where you start to cringe. You get to hear him pronouncing the words with a heavy German accent and then you get to hear his students repetitively mispronouncing the words. They suck all the beauty and fun out of the Italian language. The Pimsleur series of lessons is far superior to this.
4,well worth the money,The filter is fine it is the unit itself that is causing a problem I have had it about 4months and it is leaking and spraying water from the top of the unit. I have tried to tighting this but to no avail. If i keep the water pressure down it is not so bad but otherwise it is like another sprayer.
5,Excellent Water Filtration!,I love my Pur water filter! It filters much better than pitcher filters and the filters last over two months. The water tastes great and I feel much better knowing I'm drinking pure water for my health! Stop buying bottled water and use the Pur water filter instead! It's much better for the environment and cheaper!
5,Reggaeton finest,The whole album is great. Truly one of the finest artist to bless the urban movement....
3,5 por 5,i thought it was an ok album.. i wanted lil more reggae/hancehall song but it was good thought.. has a good vibe of reggaeton and r&b...
4,very good,"overall a good book...i wasnt a huge fan of pinball tho...was a bit too sex-oriented for my liking....my fave story was polaroid, it had an interetsing narration"
1,"Pieces of Sh... well, I don't wanna finish it.","Being somewhat anti-MTV and someone who prefers tried and true authors, I admit I approached this book with perhaps an overly critical eye.It turns out I was in for a big shock. It was worse than I could have imagined. This collection features some of the worst, most cliched PIECES of garbage I have ever had the misery to read.Everything about it screams second-rate and pretense. Not one story was compelling in the least, especially not stories such as the thinly veiled (...) that is PINBALL. Nevertheless, if you prefer hackneyed and boring stories then by all means buy this book and be happy."
5,my favorite book of all time,there's nothing more i can say other than this is an amazing book and has been my favorite book of all time for years now.
4,young,"I felt kind of old reading this book and being in my mid twenties because i felt as though it was aimed at a much younger (teen audience0, but sometimes things never change and the books and stories still resonated a lot with me. I enjoyed the stories a lot. If anything negative, the short stories left me wanting more, a lot more. Some very talented authors in the group."
2,hit or miss,"I love Perks of Being a Wallflower, so it just seemed natural that I'd get a book that Chbosky chose to associate himself with. big mistake. out of the whole book i found maybe 1 short story i really liked, 2 or 3 that were enjoyable, and the rest i had to push myself to get through.a lot of these authors were previously unpublished for a reason.if you're thinking of getting it because of Chbosky's name, don't. it's a waste. if you're getting it because you want good short stories, don't. it's a waste. but if you believe in supporting the unsupported, then by all means - go for it."
4,Almost Perfect,"Though some of the stories may seem cliche, it's interesting to get a glimpse into the creative mind of people that we normally may not have experienced. There are silly, blaring metaphores that don't evoke thought like I feel that some authors wanted, but, all in all, it's a good collection. A little MTV-ey (drugs, sex, drugs, family problems, drugs...), but an interesting read."
1,"One Wear, Then Shrank!",Can't recommend these. Laundered once and they shrank so much I can no longer use. Makes you wonder if these manufacturers who go overseas also suspend quality control.
1,What a waste,"I gave them one star because theres no provision for -0-. Legs too small, butt too big. Material is soft but too many negatives."
4,Very Comfortable!,These briefs fit well and the cotton is very soft. They are true to size. I do not put them in the dryer and they have not shrunk.
5,Exquisite,"This book, received as a gift, is one of the finest and most enjoyable art books I've read (in several decades of reading books on art). It covers the history and technique in detail - along with the behind-the-scenes stories and fascinating intrigue related to the theatre, the factories, and the courts of the period. The prose is authoritative and lively, and the color plates are absolutely breathtaking. It's exquisitely produced - a coffee table book that captivates all my guests."
4,As expected...,This functioned just as expected. It's great to have a tray specific for rings. Would like to see Amazon carry the alternate color selections also.
1,Awful - Don't Waste Your Money!,"I would not recommend these to anyone! The website recommended on the packaging to download the patterns doesn't even have the templates for this product anymore. Once you can actually get one of your photos to format correctly, the templates don't stick well. This was a total waste of money - there are many other covers out there that work TONS better. Please take my advice and don't waste your time and money on this product! I wish I hadn't."
4,A musical journey through the history of inner genius,"Kurt Bestor loves concept albums almost as much as he loves Christmas music. In this, his third concept album (the first two being ""Evening Angels"" and his ""Innovators"" collaboration with Sam Cardon)Bestor takes us on a musical journey through time as we explore the flashpoints of genius for such noted creators as Stradavarius, Audobon, Thoreau and da Vinci. His music is always emotive, drawing upon multiple styles to convey his themes to the listener; like soundtracks for the movies in your mind. A thoroughly enjoyable listening experience, ""Sketches"" will also provide you some wonderful insight into the minds and inspirational moments of some of our most innovative artists over the years."
5,A musical experience for the heart and soul.,"I love it! The songs are beautiful and inspiring. One can visualize the peacefulness of sitting by Waldon's pond, or feel the rythmn of flying in a machine inspired by Leonardo. The stories must be read to fully appreciate each song...then let yourself relax and enjoy! This album will be a classic."
2,Very Disappointing,"I heard the Pittsburgh Brass on Performance Today , plugging this CD, and thought it would be great. I bought it immediately and had it shipped overnight to my Xmas distination. A big waste of money. There are a lot of 'modern' pieces sung loudly by a large choir in unison with music which reminds me of stuff written in Britain after WWII--in minor keys, ""important""-sounding."
4,Solid performance,"Recorded in 1985, this would be America's last release for Capitol and last album until 1991's Encore. It is a solid performance and includes live versions of many of their hits, including Horse With No Name, Sister Golden Hair, You Can Do Magic, and Ventura Highway. It also includes a performance of Survival which was a big hit in Europe in 1980. Capitol would use the performances of their earlier hits on here in several later compilation releases."
1,wrong size,"this caraf is the wrong size its too small and it was not cheap, i am very dissappointed!I AM DONE WITH CUZINART I LIKED THE COFFEE MAKER UT WHAT GOODF IT IT WITHUT THE CARAF? ITS NO GOODI GAVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE i AM SO UPSET"
5,Cuisinart Carafe,"This is the exact same carafe that comes with the coffe maker. I received it quickly and intact. My only complaint is that the carafe breaks fairly easily if accidentally bumped on something hard. As far as I know, there is no alternative carafe for this coffee maker."
3,Carafe,"These carafes are the correct size, but one of them leaked from the area where the handle connects. We put superglue on it, but it should not have been shipped to us with defects."
3,Decent video,"This is a decent video where you learn a few extra techinques.There is an review portion that shows you how to knit and purl just in case you bought the wrong video. :DI personally like the video that shows the intarsia techinque the best, it was probably the only reasonway I bought this dvd.The music to knit by is original but I thought the patterns were too plain."
4,Systematic Sequential Phonics They Use,"Great resourse. Similar to Making Words 1st Grade. This book can be used as a resource in kindergarten, first grade, and for any child struggling with phonics."
2,Better go with his other book,"I've purchased both of Lian Quan Zhen books, ""Chinese WC Techniques: Painting Animals"" and ""Chinese Painting Techniques for Exquiste Watercolors"". Painting Animals has the initial info that is supplied in his Exquisite Watercolor book. He does go into more animals in Painting Animals but Exquisite Watercolor provides all you need and I think it's a better book."
4,Not as good as his first book.,I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this book because I thought his first book was great but this was a slight disappointment. I love animals and I love painting them but the examples in this book were not as appealing or as enjoyable to paint and the results were not as good as those in his general Chinese watercolor book.
2,book margaret,finally recieved on friday august 31 even though it took forever to get the book is an excellent book on chinese water color
1,Reasoning straight out of the Inquisition,"It is the ultimate irony that a man who decries the dreaded Catholic influence on these two scholars would adopt their most draconian techniques in assailing them. Take the famous 'they must be heretics, they disagree with me' approach or 'Wescott and Hort must be demonized, after all the Jehovah's witness translation is based on their text'. This work is so devoid or any true scholarship that I was reticent to even write a review. I felt it my duty, however, to warn anyone who may be considering this purchase to spend your money elsewhere. Spending it on this would truly be a waste."
1,Full of heresy...not that of Westcott and Hort but D.A.Waite,"The title Doctor before the author's name is the most confusing. Never, never, never believe the quotes of a person who quotes his enemies. He is not objective. I would recommend any reader to read the writings of Westcott and Hort directly and see how often they are quoted out of context. If you must read secondary sources, read at least they who knew each author well- there sons. The authors sons have written books about their fathers."
2,"Be careful, display won't work properly with newer GPU's!","This display will not work with newer GPU's (i.e. NVidia Ion, NVidia Quadro FX 880M, etc.) in any resolution. The display moves the screen to the top and to the left cropping off the rest of the display area, making it unuseable. Calls to LG were useless as I wasted hours talking to people that were clueless. Make sure you have a return policy before buying this display! I have two of them and neither will work with my new GPU's."
2,Washed out colors and detail with reasonable brightness settings,"I bought this monitor after seeing all the five stars... boy was I disappointed. First, the monitor fails to resume from power save mode unless you disable the DDC/CI option in the menu. Second, and most importantly, the picture quality is unbearable to my eyes. No matter how I adjusted the brightness, contrast and color temperature I could never find a combination that worked for me. I'd either have searing bright whites or muddy detail... I even tried correcting using a Huey to no avail."
4,Nothing out there Better.,"This is the standard for introduction to ASL. You get this book down, you will have a good foundation for further study and practice."
3,Good but some flaws,"Just started with Maya, and been collecting books.This is one is good except for a few flaws. In the tutorials there are errors in numbering or explanation of tecniques or tools to use which can be confusing for new users. It is something that is fairly easily overcome but never the less still should have been caught in the editing of the book.Buy Maya Fundamentals 4.5 by Jim Lammers and Lee gooding insteadMuch better book and every tutorial from the book is included on the CD-ROM that comes with the book. Makes it worth the price of the book alone"
1,it was horrible,"the author uses apostrophies in place of quotes which gets incredibly annoying after only a little while, and then the book finally gets interesting, and only a few pages after that it leaves you hanging stupidly. this book wasn't even worth reading."
5,Ranger Sam Begins,"This is the first in the Ranger Sam series. The entire series is very enjoyable reading, although there is a fair amount of violence involved in all the stories. If you enjoy the Old West style of justice, you will like this entire series, including this book."
5,SUPER SWEET UNIT..............A MUST HAVE !!!,"WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR OLD VHS VCR FINALLY DIES, BUT YOU WANT TO START A DVD COLLECTION TOO? THIS IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR PRAYER. I LOVE THIS ALL-IN-ONE UNIT. I CAN RECORD A TV PROGRAM USING THE VCR, WHILE WATCHING A DVD MOVIE AT THE SAME TIME!!! HOW COOL IS THAT? THEY SAY YOU CAN RECORD A ""NON-PROTECTED"" DVD ONTO A VHS TAPE... WHAT I LIKE IS HAVING ONE UNIT WITH ONE SET OF CABLES TO DEAL WITH & IT SUPPORTS SURROUND SOUND SYSTEMS & HAS VIDEO INPUT & OUTPUT PORTS. NO EXTRA SPACE FOR BOTH A DVD & VCR UNIT? WELL THIS COMBO IS ONLY 4"" HIGH BY 17"" WIDE AND 14"" DEEP, IS NICE LOOKING & HAS CONTROLS ON THE FRONT OF THE UNIT TOO, JUST IN CASE YOU MISPLACE YOUR REMOTE. ""GO VIDEO"" IS NOW KNOWN ""SENSORY SCIENCE"", AND THEY HAVE A WEB SITE FOR MORE INFO. NOW IF THEY WOULD DEVELOP A COMBO 13"" COLOR TV/DVD/VCR, I WOULD BE A HAPPY CAMPER. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE."
3,Beware Macrovision - This will not record most DVD's to VHS,"Just a note, checking the Go-Video website description of the DVR5000, found this feature: ""Record non-Macrovision encoded DVDs to VHS"" This probably means that Macrovision encoded DVD's cannot be copied, and most DVD's have Macrovision copy protection. Hope nobody buys this thinking they will be able to make good VHS copies of their DVD's. Maybe it will work, but probably best to wait until someone that has one tests it out and puts up a review."
4,Little Richard Rocks 'Em In Canada,"In his little-discussed (3rd) Comeback ('68 to '71), Mr. Penniman never sounded better: a deeper voice, a harder piano, and a riproaring Rock 'n Soul band. It is tragic that this jubilant period in his chaotic career is not fully represented on record [there are 6 or 7 amazing Reprise tracks and a few exciting cuts for Brunswick]. But thanks to this home video we at least get a strong taste of the live in '69 Little Richard on FILM, partying with all his girlfriends from the '50s: Lucille, Molly, Jenny, and Sally. Some new fans might be surprised to hear ""Blueberry Hill"" and ""Hound Dog"" - maybe they haven't learned that Richard cut these classics back in '64. What prevents me from issuing a FIVE star rating is that the Quasar plays piano on only two songs and that the opening number was actually performed next to last - the real show tells the 'rill' story! Shut up!"
5,Excelente!,Para mi gusto uno de los mejores trabajos de Soda Stereo. Todas y cada una de las canciones son excelentes. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book has almost nothing to do with making jewelry. The jewelry it shows you how to make (7 items you could supposedly sell) would really be ideal for an 8 year old. And, requires about the same skill level. It shows you how to string beads(duh), how to bend some wire for an earring loop, how to curl wire on a bead string so the beads are separated by curls of wire, then something about sewing a piece of cloth that was so far from jewelry making I didn't bother to read it. The last half of the book is about going into business (Hopefully not selling the crap this book shows you how to make!). I've just leafed through the book - I'm not going to waste my time reading it. Already wasted my money. Please, save yours!"
1,Don't bother,"This is not much of either type of book jewelry or doing craft type home biz. The only thing about this books title is to sell books to people that don't know much about either of the main items in the title. If you know some about either this tome will not help in any case. You can get the copyright type stuff from the Gov for free, and the legal stuff from your library. Also the laws governing a small biz are so locally written check again with your local library. I do own it and will be trying to off load it."
1,Less Jewelry Making,Disappointed with the lack of jewelry making ideas inside this book.Mostly geared toward the business aspect of selling.
1,Please don't waste your money,"This is my first Amazon video order. As a documentary movie, it is terrible. It is mostly a compilation of professional vendor videos, and I'm not even convinced the maker has the legal copyright to all the material. While it has some good moments, I get a lot better videos of paragliding straight from Youtube.Second, I bought it because it supposedly has a download option. That would only be true if you have a Kindle Fire and not the Coby Kyros that I have. I can stream it, but not download it locally.All around, a terrible waste of money and something I'll not get burned by twice."
5,"Wising Up, pushes Major buttons of Compassion!","First of all I have read all of Mr. Minchintons books, and find them very usefull in my teachings. I have used Maximum Self Esteem for seminars and classes. 52 Ways, should never be left at home. And his latest triumph, Wising Up, blew me away. He is so on the money for anyone who truely believes in being well and healing all the ruff spots we acquire through living life our way. Are you sure there are not 6 stars available for this review, it certainly deserves it."
5,Wising Up How To Stop Making Such A Mess Of Your Life,When I first picked up this book I thought this book is not for me. It was extremely easy to read and it wasn't long before it had me hooked. I love the easy way that he explains things and how they work. I have never been so pleased with a book. It has had an immediate impact on my life. I now make decisions based on exactly what works for me. This gave me the information I needed to make many positive changes in my life and now I know exactly why. I have read many self help books and I can't think of even one that was this easy to incorporate into my life. I highly recommend this book. If this had been taught as a course in school it could have saved me many years of grief.
4,Diamond Ring Buying Guide,We purchased the book to have some what of a better understanding of how diamonds are valued and priced. This book seems to have most everything we wanted from it. Good Book.
3,The biggest purchase you will ever make,"... a house, a car, and a diamond ring. We bought this book before we bought our diamond and found it really helpful. There is plenty of information on the internet, and a great Jeweler is always a plus. Finding someone who is willing to work with you, educate you and help you find just the right stone is really important.In addition to buying this book, I suggest getting in touch with Duane at tradeshop.com. He was really helpful to us, explaining the ins and outs of diamond buying and helping us pinpoint just what we wanted without breaking the bank. We ended up buying my diamond wholesale for him and it appraised at double the price. I can't recommend him highly enough."
5,"Some much deserved American publicity for Mantel, at last!","When I discovered this book last year and began to read it, I felt after only ten pages the relief one gets when one can relax into the embrace of a true mastercraftsman. Mantel never lets the reader down here. Superbly skilled in creating relentless, razor sharp images of lower middleclass family life, of personally thwarted parents with bigger goals for their children, and of striving and desperately motivated young people, Mantel will, for many readers, succeed in conjuring up some of their own nightmares of youth and school life. Oft recognized by the British with innumerable prizes and awards, Mantel is deservedly considered to be ""the novelist of her generation who will achieve lasting greatness"" (Literary Review)"
2,Didn't like the story,"The book came in great condition, this review isn't against the vendor, just the writer.the violence is extremely graphic, the writer makes sure to express the bloody gore in complete detail. This writer should be writing for horror fans, not Dr. Who fans."
1,Save Your Money,I got about a third of the way through this thing. The best discriptive word for it is 'ICK'.
2,Check out other products,I would not recommend these crutches if you need to use them for longer than 3 months. The rubber in the pads soon starts to wear leaving annoying pieces of rubber on your clothes and hands. The top pads also soon ripped due the plastic frame being curved. They are fine if you just need them for a couple of weeks. For longer term use I would go with a higher quality brand.
5,Serves its purpose,"Although, I only had to use crutches for a few days, this item served its purpose."
3,Passionless Prosecution,"Author Jay Brandon sends state prosecutor Kelsey Thatch into the murky enclave of Galilee, deep in the Piney Woods of East Texas, to pinch hit for local DA Morgan Fletcher, who's got a major conflict of interest--his brother Billy's been indicted for a double murder. This is a whodunit and armchair sleuths too easily focus on Morgan instead of Billy. And that's without the aid of the Texas Ranger assigned to help Kelsey with the investigation. He only shows up long enough to say he can't stay. (A Texas Ranger derelict in his duty? Unbelievable!) Apparently, Brandon forgets about the Ranger to bring on a local deputy as his surrogate and Kelsey's romantic interest. To find the facts, Kelsey struggles with the social labyrinth of the inbred East Texas town. The plot twists become fairly predictable and the story never catches fire. In the end the reader really doesn't care what happens to any of them."
4,info for upper grades -- personal details,"This is an acceptable, but sentimental, biography for 6th-graders and up. Not much humor, just straight telling. The book focuses much more on his life before and after the presidency, skipping much about his actual time leading the nation. A few photos and documents (some good letters) are reprinted. It doesn't do a particularly good job dealing with Harding's Teapot Dome scandal, which Coolidge cleaned up.However, the information about the formative years of Coolidge's life, and his elected offices prior to the presidency, and his response to the deaths of his son and his father, is very good.This book delivers a likable Coolidge and lays out his personality, but mostly leaves his leadership out. Better info is available in ""Calvin Coolidge"" by Amy Graham, for a similar age group.We used ""Silent Cal: The Wit and Wisdom of Calvin Coolidge"" to really bring more information about Calvin Coolidge's likability to light."
1,Not good for any age group,"I checked out this book because it was the only book on Calvin Coolidge in my library (they had placed it in the adult section.) The vocabulary is adult while the writing style is for children.I wish I hadn't checked it out. The book focuses on Coolidge the human being and episodes such as how hurt he was by the death of his son. I wanted information on policy choices. Lastly, there is nothing about Mexico in the entire book. Maybe we had improved relations with them, I don't know. But I do know that ""This was a time of Ku Klux Klan resurgence..."" and that's all we get about it!If you give this book to any child, be they ages 9-12 or grades 6-9, you deserve to be slapped."
4,Plasma TV,Well Plasma Tv are very pricey as you can see however they are great for people who have web TV and like new digtal thingsI bought a Plasma tv this on THIS TV IS SUPER IT WEIGHS 1.5 POUNDS AND IS THIS LIGHTEST THING ON EARTH YOU SEE I TRAVEL ALOT AND STILL NEED A TVoK lisT1. PRICEY REALLY PRICEY2. MOST DIGITAL TV OUT THERE3. VERY LIGHT EASY FOR TRAVEL4.EASY TO USE install wed TV all
2,"Drab, dreary and dull","The first issue I have with this short film is the narrator needs to be Southern because he or she is supposed to represent the townsfolk. Instead we get Professor Kingsley, an East coast snob. Nope. It does not work. John Houseman is wrong for this. Then the editing is dull. We have NO clear idea why Emily falls for the man she kills or why she kills him. And the scene that shows him bathing publicly with his male friends is hilarious, but inintentionally so. Whoever adapted this has no sense of what to do with the characters--they just stare at each other. Dialogue has to be invented--it was not. So much could have been done, but so little was. I spent a bundle on a gamble thinking Angelica Houston would never be in such a low class production. I doubt I will show this to my English classes, except as an example of poor craftsmanship."
2,Nothing special here.,"As trance compilations go, this one is average at best. Usually the first 3-4 tracks are throw aways, but this CD has a whopping 18 tracks that are totally uninspired, and all sound like they were mixed by the same guy with a terminal synthetic horn fetish.These 18 songs all sound the same, and there's not a single keeper on the entire disk. Yes, its that bad."
4,An excellent compilation!!!,"I bought this cd randomly, seeing it came out in 2004 and was a Euro mix and cheaply priced...and I must say it is bummpin! As a serious trance extraordinaire, i've heard trance nation, tunnel trance force and dream dance compilations, and this one is up in those ranks in its uplifting form. The ""Body and Soul"" track is just unbelievable, and it is worth buying the cd for that mix alone, but not to worry, most tracks on this cd are Winners...Tallyho!"
4,Kettler Metal Basket,A plus for taking things to the park. My only complaint was with Amazon not packing it much better. The metal is so soft that I just pushed out the dents.
3,"Works ""OK""....","This basket works fine with my Kettrike (I can't remember the model, but it's the basic $120 model), but it falls off ALL THE TIME. I'm giving it a 3 star review because this basket only works if you zip-tie it to the darn bike, LOL! Otherwise, once zip-tied it works great!"
3,Basket does not fit Kiddi-oSupertrike 3,"I purchased in good faith the Kiddi-0 Supertrike 3 and the Blue Metal Baskets for Kettrikes. Both items were on the same page. I found out that the baskets do not fit this bike. I called Kettler International and was told that Amazon.com was asked to correct this ad, but has not. The sad part even though it was their mistake they would not return my shipping to me. They indicated I should have not ordered the baskets. But they were listed on the same page. Do not purchase both items together because you will have to send it back at your expense."
1,Amazon needs to fix their mistake!,"I too have just become aware that this basket does not fit the Kiddio-3 trike! It came up as an accessory item while ordering this item. We just tried to put the basket on the trike, as everyone else just said, it does not fit! I'm very frustrated with this! I usually always read the reviews on items before I buy them. In this case I didn't because it was an accessory item and I never thought Amazon would have this listed if it was incorrect, especially seeing as they have been made aware of this problem! I will be calling them tomorrow, and I hope that they will be good about returning it. I refuse to pay for the shipping, the basket itself only cost $10. If anything, I have learned a lesson to make sure I ALWAYS read the reviews! VERY disappointing!"
2,Ordered this item 2 items and both times received defective products.,"I ordered the Kettler tricycle basket 2 times and both baskets had large holes in the wire mesh basket where the wire mesh was missing in different places. As the basket is for my child to put special items in, I would like a basket that is not defective. I am ordering this basket ONE more time and hoping that I get a good product. I am starting to wonder if that exists, which is sad considering this is a Kettler brand product and the tricycle itself was extremely pricey. I expect much better quality products from Kettler than this."
3,Its a basket,Fits ok. Unfortunately has nothing to hold it in place better. It can fall off easily due to the way it is attached. A better design would be better to retain it to the trike.
2,Basket is removed too easily,The basket is poorly designed. My 18 month-old son easily takes it off. It would be better if it were designed like the Kettler bell and couldn't be removed just by pulling on it.
4,Kettler basket,"I'm happy with the Kettler bike basket. It's cute to hold something small - like a drink or small stuffed friend. The only downside is it is easy take the basket off - it doesn't have any sort of ""stay-put"" mechanism & if my 1 yr old is getting bored, she pulls the basket off. I need to put a tiewrap through it to keep it on. Gonna go do that now..."
3,nice basket for the Kettler tricycle,"This is a nice basket for the Kettler tricycle. Our toddler likes to pull it off and throw it away when we are pushing him on the trike, so it may be better for slightly older kids (our toddler is 2)."
3,"Nice, but needs work","This is a good quality basket, but like other reviewers, I found that it did not stay well attached to the Kettler trike. We ended up using zip ties to keep it in place."
1,Poorly designed,This basket does not work well with the Happy Navigator model. I need to use a string in order to keep the basket from falling off. I am very disappointed with the product.
2,Doesn't work on my Kettrike Air Happy Trike,"I have the Kettrike Air Happy tricycle, which my 2-year-old daughter loves. However this basket falls off with the slightest jarring of the tricycle. I used garbage bag ties to keep it on which isn't so bad. I would probably still buy it again since it fits in the spot on the bike nicely."
1,Boring,"This video is boring for kids. Each exercise last for just a couple of seconds. Exercises are too short and with no enthusiasm. I wouldn't recommend this video. My daughter who is 7 years old, did the video once and she didn't like it. Everything happens so fast, they go from one exercise to another in seconds."
4,Great for my purpose,"I purchased this MP3 player so I could listen to music while I work out. iRiver made one spectacular improvement with this model over the 700 series in including the sport armband. My wife and I shared the 256MB 700 series model and I had to buy the armband as an accessory.The main complaint is that the iRiver Music Manager software is difficult at best. If I can get it to recognize that I have my player plugged into my computer it works great, otherwise it is a hassle. Using Windows Media Player or MusicMatch Jukebox is just as easy to put songs on the player, but not to organize them.Overall a good product that is easy to use. My next MP3 purchase will be another iRiver."
4,230 plus songs.,This mp3 player is awesome ive had it for three years already and i have like two hundred and fortytwo songs and there is a little bit of space left!I love it.
5,YIPPY!,"So i was givin an iPod shuffle and it was defective so I exchanged it for the iRiver... I Love It!... The arm band is too small for an adult arm but works nicely as a wrist band. The player, talk about bells and whistles. I am too stuborn to read the directions so I know I dont know all of the features yet but it's so easy to used I didnt bother!"
3,Unattributed quotation: Jane Austen fans!,"""It is truth universally acknowledged ..."" many will no doubt recognize this as the opening line of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" (Ch. 1). You can find this sentence in its entirety at the opening of Ch. 5 (""L'Education Sentimentale"") by Philip Ziegler in his biography of Edward VIII, and without any attribution to Ms. Austen. No, the Bibliography does not have the credit listed. I find it fascinating that Ziegler reports that Edward was unschooled in English classics (and he may have been) (Ch. 1 ""The Child"" p16-17), but Ziegler cannot be similarly uninformed.Curiously, a similar borrowing has been noted in Ziegler's Mountbatten (1985), where the Austen text is from the opening chapter of ""Persuasion"". Here, he suggests that Mountbatten was absorbed in his own geneology, which once again Ziegler notes was far from his actual character."
5,lady boss,"Lady Boss was fantastic. Like all the books in the six book series of Lucky Santangelo, I simply could not put it down."
1,Granny's WORST Feather/Down Pillows,"These pillows are about as conducive to a good night's sleep as a throbbing headache! They make a loud crunchy noise when touched. You can see every ""feather"" through both the outer covering and the pillow case itself, and I remain unconvinced they are in fact feathers, as I have never known feathers that could shred the human ear. If there is additional filler in these pillows, my bets are on cat litter. If these truly are ""Granny's Best"" pillows, I'd hate to lay my head on her Worst! Do yourself a favor and keep shopping."
5,"Good, old-fashioned feather pillows.","These are exactly what they say they are. Feather pillows (a cloth sack filled with feathers). So comfy and nice. Just what I wanted. I am not seeing quills poking through, nor am I smelling any strange odors. If down pillows are your thing, look elsewhere, but if you like real feather pillows like I do, these are a great deal!"
1,"""Foul"" Pillows","Seemed like a good buy,CAVEAT EMPTOR, not for any price. These pillows smell like wet dog and have a powder that comes out when fluffed or squeezed. The manufacturing company on the tag,""Sleepline Industries Inc. in Union NJ could not be found anyplace on the web or White or Yellow pages to ask what this mysterious powder or odor was due to. Even though the tag indicated the contents of the pillow were sterilized, I am not sure sterilized with what or by what. I am wondering where the feathers came from, China? I wonder about Avian Flu or some other spore or powder born disease. It is cheaper to throw them away than send them back to Sportsmans Guide."
5,DMI AMBASSADOR 7340-56,"I bought the 7340-56 (with a left-return) last July. It is in every way just great. I am now shopping for the 7340-36 desk with no return for my wife who also fell in love with my desk. I guess this makes my purchase a little expensive, but if it makes she-who-must-be obeyed happy, then I'm happy too. The desk is beautiful, flawless, sturdy, and comfortable. Enjoy."
1,A total waste of time and money,"This video is nothing more than an episode of a British talk show, Gardiner's World. Robert and Olivia Temple are plugging their book about the Sphinx. There are a few photos of the exterior of the Sphinx, but no video. The Temples claim there was a lake (a moat) around the Sphinx, which left erosion lines on the stones. However, there is no video of these lines. There is nothing in this video to show that the Temples were even at the Sphinx.The authors talk about secret chambers but there are no photos of anything inside the Sphinx. Olivia Temple talked about how she distracted some of the guards while Robert Temple was exploring inside the Sphinx. He provides no photos of anything inside.If I could rate this as ""zero stars,"" I would."
5,Remove Psychic Debris and Heal Vol. 1,"I am writing this review actually for all of Steve's Psychic DVD's. I have this DVD (Increase Your Psychic Abilities) and the two volumes of Psychic Attunements, plus the Trilogy series. They are professional and well done, and they WORK! As with all of his DVD's he walks you step by step through the process and shows you how to hold your hands and clearly states throughout the attunement where the hand placements are and when to use them. These DVD's are powerful and will give results, but as with everything, practice your new skill as it gets better and better with time."
3,lost interest fast,"This is a very well made game, however it did not hold my kids attention for long. We prefer Hi-Ho Cherry-O, Uno, or Hungry Hippos for my three year old. My kids only seem interested in it at all when they are one and two years old. After that...it's time to move on."
4,Fun for all ages!!,I use this as a motivational game for my elementary kids that I see for speech and language therapy. Kids from kindergarten thru fifth grade LOVE this game. Easy to play and lots of fun!! One of my favorites!
5,Shakespeare programs for children,"I am very, very pleased with this book. I found all of the information on Shakespeare fascinating and the activities will be very good for the programs our art organization is offering."
1,false advertising,"Purchased a hardback book from vendor as represented and advertised site. Received a paperback. False advertising by vendor. Returned product, very disappointed that a vendor did not represent honesty."
3,Sedaris searching for his voice,"I'm a big fan of David Sedaris. So why the 3 stars? I'll explain...I read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" first and was blown away by it's clever, concise style. I laughed out loud many, many times. Then I read ""Naked,"" another fantastic book. Both of these are written in a memoir style, snapshots of his hilarious and often painful life.""Barrel Fever"" on the other hand has a lot of satire, not a lot of his effective memoir style. It seems like he's searching for his voice in this book. However, he does strike gold with ""The Santaland Diaries,"" the hysterical description of his job as an elf for a mall Santa. This story is also printed in ""Holidays on Ice."" I would recommend that book in place of ""Barrel Fever.""""Naked,"" ""Me Talk...,"" and ""Dress Your Family..."" are all great books. Order them and laugh yourself sick."
2,Inchoate humor...,"This was the last Sedaris book I read, and I guess I was just spoiled by his other works. Sedaris shines when regaling us with the autobiographical stories of his family, his boyfriend, or his experiences...just about everywhere.His fictional offerings are a bit useless. The charm of his dark, sardonic wit is in his skewed perspective of reality. When this translates to fiction it loses its validity. There's nothing funny about fake cynnicism. Barrel Fever is mostly fictional short stories, so there's not much here that will captivate you.The same could be said of Holidays On Ice but that book retains a fairly steady degree of humor and themes that redeem the fiction. Go read ""Naked"" or ""Dress Your Family in Cordury and Denim"". His later works are far superior to this."
2,Peculiar And Wickedly So.,"Wasn't sure what to make of this collection. It's not the standard form or flow of Sedaris. And most of it is just rambling made-up characters and disjointed stories that serve no particular purpose.The quotes from the jacket [""shrewd, wickedly funny...""] must be freely peppered across the cover based on other works - because nothing in this collection truly merits the praise printed.Some here have said this book shows Sedaris seeking his voice - and as such could be the case, move on to other selections where Sedaris has clearly found that voice."
4,"Easy read, pretty entertaining...","Although not all the stories were laugh out loud funny as I was led to believe from all the rave reviews, it was still pretty damned entertaining; especially 'SantaLand' and the 'suicide letter'. Those are the two stories that had me chuckling to myself. The others sometimes lost me. But overall a good read... great for a long commute. Definitely recommend it! I look forward to reading more of his work."
4,"Wonderfully written and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny","I couldn't put this book down! I didn't find all of the stories to be as good as some of the clear winners of the bunch, but they were all engaging and very entertaining. Wonderfully written in prose that could easily be studied by aspiring writers. I plan to begin reading the author's next book, ""Naked,"" right away. While this book contains a collection of (mostly) short stories and (some) non-fiction essays, I felt the essays were the best. It's good to see that his other books seem to contain (all?) essays. A truly enjoyable read!As a side note, I read the Kindle edition of this book. It was well formatted and contained the entire text."
4,Sedaris Siblings So Funny,"David Sedaris' early work, like this book and Naked, are the best of his collection. His later books tend to be a bit more forced in their humour, so the earlier his work, usually the better it is. His sister Amy has a entertainment book that is tongue in cheek and a laugh riot. www.tracymears.com"
5,David Sedaris is too funny for color television,"I swear, David Sedaris is one of the funniest human beings alive today. Whether recalling his high school days in Raleigh, North Carolina, or wandering the world from Normandy to Japan with Hugh, he always seems to be able to find the funny side of life. What is remarkable is his ability to find the humor in situations that are sad and tragic. There can a dark side to humor sometimes, a constant reminder that sometimes we laugh to keep from crying, sometimes we laugh while we are crying. I've now read everything the man has written - not a dud in the lot. I can't recommend his work highly enough. I would add one caveat. Some of his stories are rated ""R"" for language. Even in these lax and liberal days, I would be reluctant to pass his stories along to young children or those of a Neo-Puritan mindset."
3,Strike Out,"After reading David Sedaris's most recent novel, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, I was all gung-ho and enthusiastic about reading Barrel Fever. It turned out my enthusiasm ebbed slightly when I realized the book was a let-down compared to Dress Your Family. While amusing at parts, and while just as talented of writing, I didn't find myself laughing out loud or constantly wanting to read more.But I will say the Essays section is a lot funnier than the Stories section in Barrel Fever, so if you stick with the book until the end, your patience might be rewarded, depending on how you look at the mediocre barrel of laughs in store. If you're looking for an excellent book full of hearty humor, I highly reccomend Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim."
4,Not for the meek!,"Boy, David Sedaris can write! But don't expect an uproarious read. What you'll find here is warped, stinging satire of life's underbelly, sometimes sad, sometimes shocking, sometimes funny. Always true to life though. Sedaris kicks us through life's meanness with his tongue in his cheek."
3,Possibly 3 1/2 stars,"This is my least favorite David Sedaris book, but it's still a must for Sedaris-holics such as myself. I think I prefer the all-essay format of ""Naked"" and ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"", but I have to admit that some of the fiction (this book is approx. 75% fiction, 25% essays) is very funny, in his very dark humor way,such as ""The Last You'll Hear From Me"", and ""Glen's Homophobic Newsletter Vol. 2, No. 3"". The now-famous ""Santaland Dairies"" is probably worth the purchase of the book. It's also included in the ""Holidays on Ice"" collection. If you're a real fan, read it!"
2,Not Sedaris's best!,"I adored ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" and thought ""Naked"" was quite good, too. But I was very disappointed in ""Barrel Fever"". In fact, I don't think I even bothered to finish it, because so many of the stories were just plain outrageously disgusting and weird and not funny at all. PLEASE don't judge Sedaris on this book alone -- try ""Me Talk Pretty""! I laughed so hard while reading it that my husband sent me out of the room."
3,David Sedaris is a Dangerous Genius,"I first bought NAKED, and because I loved his writing style and dark humor I was compelled to buy BARREL FEVER. I even recommended BARREL FEVER to my friends and co-workers BEFORE I read it because I was SO sure it would be as wonderful if not more so than NAKED. But I was shocked, dismayed, taken aback by the book. It was not quite what I expected. I still love Sedaris' essays--VERY much! The struggling writing in me is terrifically jealous of his keen ability with the language and his twisted wit. But I was disappointed and a little disgusted with his fiction pieces. They are not for the timid of heart, so take heed, fellow booksmiths and bookworms."
2,ick,"I stumbled onto ""Naked,"" thoroughly enjoyed it and was looking forward to this one. But...ick! The first 2/3 - the stories - were too mean-spirited, and only the last third - the essays - reminded me of why I'd sought this out. He definitely does real life better than fiction."
2,Skip it,"I enjoyed his other titles, and picked this out based on a story I randomly read at the store. I thought it would be a great gift for a relative. Wrong! I will be returning the because there are so many other Sedaris books out there that I feel are more entertaining and lighthearted. Honestly I might have enjoyed it more if there were an introduction or forward from the author, explaining his frame of mind while writing some of these stories. They are macabre, bizarre, and at some points shocking, which on the whole are not bad things. But, having read Naked, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, the 'voice' in Barrel Fever just doesn't match up."
5,AMAZING!!!,"David Sedaris has become my favorite author. His wit and incredible ability for satire makes him one of the funniest writers today. This, as well as all of his other books, are highly recommended. Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Just horrible!,"I have read all of David Sedaris's books and I was looking so forward to this one...it is THE WORST! The stories are not only NOT funny, but many times just very base and crass...I felt disgusted when I read some of them. It was like someone completely different had written them. I was extremely disappointed with this book, I would highly recommend avoiding it at all costs. If you want to see great writing with insight and humor, get any other Sedaris book. This one was just horrendous."
3,Bitter after taste,I haven't read all of David Sedaris' books in chronological order and therefore have only just finished this book. Whilst I think all of his books are definitley worth reading this one left a slightly bad taste in my mouth as some of the stories are off colour.I now only have to read Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim but am going to wait a while as I feel I need a bit of a break from him as I have read his other books back to back.I still recommend this book but so far it has been the most disappointing.
3,Save this one for last.,"David Sedaris' work as a writer is top notch. This book, however is not up there with the rest. The essays at the end of the book are the typical Sedaris gems (The ""SantaLand Diaries"" are almost worth the price alone), but I think the short stories are for a rather limited readership. In the same way that I am not all pumped up about ""Def Comedy Jam"" or The Latin Grammy's, the short stories did not strike me as entertaining. The writing is superb, but with the very gay-specific subject matter it is best to save this book for last in your quest to conquer David Sedaris."
2,If I could talk to everyone....,"...You don't have to be, ""a rabid homophobe"" not to enjoy a fair portion of this book. The sexual content (especially early on) borders on graphic and offensive and is entirely too pervasive to be ignored....I would say to people who have bought this, but haven't yet read it(especially Sedaris fans), it gets better after the first few stories. I was pretty sure after two stories I would never make it through. But it picked up enough to make me finish it. And, having done so, I'm not terribly disappointed....I would say to people who haven't read any Sedaris, not to start on this one. ""Naked"" and ""Me Talk Pretty"" are much more engaging, insightful, and entertaining. Had I started on this book, I doubt I would have ever picked up another. And I can honestly say, that would have been a shame."
1,How come I can't give it ZERO stars?!?,"After reading Naked I was sure this book would live up to my high expectations. It definitely did not. I am a fan of Sedaris' caustic, sardonic, and slightly poignant sarcasm, this book was sadly lacking. You don't have to be ""timid of heart"" as another reader/reviewer indicated, to be offended and disgusted by some of these stories. Vulgarity and depravity is scrumptious if it's witty and funny...this was not."
1,Sends you to sleep,"Maybe I have to read more books of Sedaris to discover where all the laughter is but, from my experience, I can tell you that this guy is a master in keeping it out of your reach.There was not even one chapter or essay that could twist my mouth into the most subtle smile, and that is an achievement 'cause I'm the sort of guy who can laugh at the most stupid gags.If you liked American Pie, The Naked Gun series, and that kind of movies, then you're probably feel very dissapointed by this book. If you are a fan of Sedaris, sorry, you read the wrong review."
1,Can I rate it less than one star?,"Barrel Fever is a lame attempt at ""cutting edge"" humor. The collection consists of stories that are mostly one note ideas with little insight or compassion.The writing is sophmoric, as are the attempts at outrageousness which fail to obscure that Barrel Fever is not funny"
3,A mix of entertaining and disturbing tales,"I'm not sure how to rate or describe this book. One story, a true tale of the author's experiences as an Christmas elf at Macy's, is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Other stories range from interesting to severely disturbing. There's a letter written by a suicide to be read at her funeral that starts out darkly enough, but turns increasingly darker and more depressing. There are a number dark and depressing of tales of frighteningly dysfunctional and teenage homoeroticism that are just too bizarre and depressing for me to see the humor in"
3,Like watching a train wreck,"I have to preface this review by telling you that I bought this book because the first Sedaris book I read (Me Talk Pretty One Day) had me laughing out loud. I couldn't wait to get more Sedaris, and had no doubt that I would love every word he has ever written. WRONG. Whoa, how wrong could I be? It's not that it is not a good book...but, although the stories (short, and crisply written) get and hold your attention, they are completely dark and depressing. Yes, I admit that Santaland Diaries was funny. But I guess I'd have to compare it to how you laugh when you hit your funny bone. You don't really want to laugh, because it really hurts, but you just can't help it...this book isn't for everyone--and I'll go with that assessment. I found this book to be far more tragic and depressing than I expected. Be prepared!"
2,"Disappointing, go elsewhere","Surely one of his lesser appreciated works, but with good reason. ""Me Talk Pretty"" and ""Naked"" are eons ahead in terms of style, wit, and humor. ""Barrel Fever"" is much darker and lacks the polish and playful tone that won him Time magazine's 2001 Humorist of the Year award and the Thurber Prize for American Humor. If you're an audio-book enthusiast Sedaris has no equal for delivery and punch. Highly recommended."
3,What's Reality?,"David Sedaris' ""Barrel Fever"" is an odd hybrid of a book: stories together with essays? But a consistent tone and narrative style soon comes across in this slim volume of personal essays and fiction. Sedaris loves to blur the boundary between reality and delusion. His work displays a healthy dose of sarcasm, but the pieces are so slight they mostly fail to engage readers. After all, you can only sympathize so much with a man who rants from the grave and curses childhood friends for the smallest slight. As pure shock value, the stories work. His essays suffer from the same nasty tone. Only ""SantaLand Diaries"" creates a successful vision of the world. In this last essay, Sedaris relates his experiences working as an elf at Macy's Christmas display. Here, at last, Sedaris' wit combines with brilliant insights into human nature. You'll get the feeling the rest of the book was just an excuse to get to this concluding piece."
3,Barrel FEver,Not Sedaris' best work. Either he is becoming less edgy or I m becoming more critical. Maybe I have just outgrown his humor
2,Not nearly as funny as his recent stuff.,"This collection is unlike his others because it's all fantasy. Usually, when I read a Sedaris essay, I get a big laugh every few pages, but this was much less funny. When You Are Engulfed in Flames is worth every penny, though!"
4,Barrel Fever-Sedaris,"I really enjoy reading Sedaris. I love how he can make you cringe & laugh on the same page. My favorite by far, ""Naked"". He's got a wonderful style of keeping you interested, you cannot read fast enough! If you enjoy his work, you will also like Augusten Burroughs."
4,"It was good, but...",not as good as Naked. I think that it lost some of the with and replaced it with shock.
1,bad sedaris,Unlike other Sedaris works. Bought this as a fun summer read at the beach and found the book to be utterly depressing. I was unable to find the hummor in this book compared to his other works where I often laugh out loud.
3,Sedaris Good,"Perhaps not as endearing as Me Talk Pretty One Day and When You Are Engulfed in Flames, but still Sedaris good.There should be a 3.5 star option."
4,Interesting and Creative,"This book can be a bit of a grab bag as far as the quality of each individual story. Some, especially including the last one (StanaLand Diaries), are excellent, and some are a bit more hit or miss. Though for the most part David Sedaris keep them interesting will some interesting (though Dark) humor. It can at times become a bit depressing and down, but there are still interesting aspects to just about every one of the stories in Barrel Fever."
3,David Sedaris: The Early Years,"Barrel FeverIt's probably best to read Barrel Fever AFTER you have read all of Sedaris' other works. As other 3-star reviewers note, Sedaris' more recent collections are far funnier and better crafted and stylized. If you pick up Barrel Fever and have not read Me Talk Pretty One Day, you may get the false impression that Sedaris is a so-so writer whose is variably funny and witty. I prefer to look at Barrel Fever as an early photograph of what Sedaris would eventually fully develop and polish.Many of the stories/essays in this collection are too short to give more than a cursory glance at their subjects. When you finally get to the last work, SantaLand Diaries, you feel like Sedaris has finally reached you as a reader, and you (hopefully) will forgive the previous missteps and awkward experiments in style. Barrel Fever has plenty of funny moments, but it is simply not nearly as mature as Sedaris' later books."
2,Disappointing,"I must agree with many of the reviewers, after reading ""Naked"" and ""Dress Your Family..."" I expected this book to have me laughing out loud. I am now on page 79 and have smiled once - I don't remember at what.In other books that Sedaris wrote, he turns ordinary real-life events into hilarious encounters. I read his other books and found myself rereading lines to friends as we both laughed out loud. Instead of writing about his life (and the lives of others around him), Barrel Fever is a collection of mostly fiction stories (12) with four essays at the end of the book. I found none of the fictional stories to be funny, nor any of the essays.If you want to laugh out loud, read ""Naked"" and ""Dress Your Family in..."" If you must read ""Barrel Fever,"" borrow a friends copy so you won't feel guilty about wasting your money."
2,Skip This and Re-Read Me Talk Pretty One Day,"What a tremendously disappointing read. If it weren't for the final story, Santaland Diaries, I would have only given this book one star, and only then because I couldn't give it less. I was not looking for a re-tread of ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" but I was looking for something of comparable quality (which in ""Pretty"" was stellar), and this was NOT it. Meandering, pointless, humorless ramblings from someone who is capable of much better writing.Only in Santaland Diaries do we get to see the Sedaris that crackles with dark humor and hilarious cynicism. I loved every word of this story and couldn't help but wish that the rest of the book had been this wonderful. My heartfelt advice is that you borrow Barrel Fever from the library, memorize Santaland Diaries, and ignore the rest."
3,Don't let this be your first Sedaris,"If you haven't read any other Sedaris, this isn't the book for you. Go pick up ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" and ""Naked."" If you are already a fan of the witty self-deprecating voice from his memoirs, then give this a shot. This is very different from the humor in his memoirs, and some of it just borders on bizarre. I'm a huge fan and I was put off by some of the crass and downright weird stories.There are a few gems, and any Sedaris fan should hunt them out. ""The Santland Diaries"" is the most famous, having been read on NPR, and that's a true winner (but it is also republished in the highly recommended Holidays on Ice). Another one I particularly enjoyed was ""After Malison,"" which is told from the point of view of a rabid fan of the author Malison, who thinks no one else can understand her precious writer, and who self-implodes with her antics."
4,Funny,"BARREL FEVER includes some hilarious bits. The last piece, the Macy's elf bit, is hilarious. I've read parts of it countless times. The piece on his mother being a smoker is hilarious, too. Most of the rest of the pieces are ficiton, and they are only fitfully hilarious. Only sections of those are very good. Sidaris has not mastered how to construct a proper narrative arc for a piece of fiction. So his nonfiction is better. I hope he realizes his failing with fiction, and keeps working at it, because once he overcomes his shortcomings in the fiction department, I could see him writing brilliant short stories that are great from start to finish, and perhaps write a novel that would give CATCH 22 a run for its money. He has an affection for people of all types, foibles and all, and that aspect of his writing/personality alone makes you want to smile."
4,"Funny, but inconsistent","This predecessor to 'Naked' doesn't quite deliver the goods the way Sedaris' later book does. A mix of fiction and essays, Barrel Fever swings from weird and funny to just plain weird. The essays, highlighted by his priceless 'Santaland Diaries', far outstrip the fiction. In any case, inconsistent Sedaris is still worth a read."
5,"Weird, funny and original!","Sedaris grabbed my attention with his radio pieces. His humor is so original I keep this book by my bed- so if I've had a hard day I can reread ""The Last you'll hear from me"" or "" Diary of a Smoker"" and laugh at the world and its quirks. Sedaris certainly has a penchant for seeing the absurdities of the world- he's sort of like both the Coen brother of print. This book proves he is one of the weirdest and funniest writers around ."
2,Too Much Work,"This pack is very cumbersome to get into. And I found the inside of it to be too small and divided up while the outside seems large. It is well constructed however, just didn't work for my needs."
2,A lot less than you might expect,"The description of this book given by Amazon is misleading. The book is described as being 148 pages, but don't expect nearly that volume of material. Chapter 1 begins on page 17 and the last chapter ends on page 93. That means there are about 76 actual pages.The catch is, those 76 pages are printed in huge typeface that reminds me of a large print edition for the visually challenged. If this book were printed in a standard font, I suspect there would be 50 pages of usable material at best. About 20 pages of the book are nothing more than the same form (of very dubious value) duplicated over and over again. Like a college freshman writing his first research paper, the publisher has pulled all the stops to make this book appear more substantial than it is.Those seeking a real book on the topic will likely be disappointed here, as I was."
2,Published in 2000,"I was surprised this book was published in 2000. I felt it was useful but probably outdated? Matbe not, but I know things change and get updated when dealing with government agencies."
1,Not a good book,"This book was really bad! It is only 50 pages long, if you subtract all the table of contents pages. Also it contains no helpful information, basically says there is no way to win everyone is a faker and it is great to give up. It is not written by a lawyer who wins cases, but a clerk from SSI who denied people all day long that is the ""Insider"" part. I am glad I read ""Win Your Social Security Disability Case: Advance Your SSD Claim and Receive the Benefits You Deserve (Sphinx Legal) Benjamin Berkley"" first, it had much more information on what ssi is and how to win a case and keep the money."
5,not finished,"I have not completely finished this book. However, I have found much needed info in it. It is very easy to read."
1,How to Gett SSI & Social Security Disability,"Mike has the best of intentions but... it's obvious this is a self published book with a very poor writing style. As a previous SSA worker, he has a lot of useless SSA 'speak'and loads of equally useless insider buzz words. Large print is annoying and used to take up space because he has so little to say. There's maybe 500 words about filling out an application for SSDI. The title is a lie and absolutely misleading. Do not buy it, save your money."
1,not a very good book,"like the author saids he work befor he wrote this book,but it is not as simple was of no help for the realtime issues."
3,SSI - Good Read,This was a good read book. I would have to write a review later to let people know if anything in it helped.
2,Step by step Guide to Social Security,This book is not as good as Nolo's Guide. I do recommend it at all..
2,way too small,"The quality of the hats was O.K. for the money. But it was too small. It barely fits my 7 years old son. So I gave to him. If you need a hat for a kid, go for it. But if you need good size hat, don't buy from these guys."
3,Just what I expected...,"What you see is what you get! I wish the vendor would have sent the item in better packaging -- the hat has permanent wrinkles from having been compacted into a tiny little box. Also, the item was 2-3 days late... so order early!"
5,Great price/quality as expected,Just what we needed-the hat is sturdy and of good material. We used them as party favors with our own decorations on front. Great price.
3,ok but nothing special,basic cap - ok as an accessory but not one of the better caps I've had... haven't washed it yet so don't know if it holds its shape.
1,Terrible!,The picture and the description lie. The front is not foam and the hat is big enough for a small infant. Nothing irritates me more than false advertising.
2,very cheap cap and its not worth the price,the picture of the cap is not consistent. the cap like made with cheap materials and not worth the price
3,It's OK,"This hat is OK but probably should be priced at about $5 max. Also, it seems a bit small for anybody with a bigger than average sized head."
3,Not Sturdy!,"The hats were for a dance team, though they will be fitting for what we need they are VERY flimsy and not worth the money if planning to wear day to day."
3,Trucker hat,For some strange reason my 14 year old wanted this type of hat. He loves it and was happy to see it had no creases that ruined the shape of it.
4,Interesting Look at Gang Sociology,"This landmark 1927 book by sociologist Frederick Milton Thrasher of the University of Chicago was considered a classic of its time. We read it for a college class, and it was pretty interesting despite a somewhat academic style. Thrasher illustrates the lifestyles of Chicago's then 1,300 street gangs (today it's about 200), most of whose members were of white immigrant stock (today its largely blacks and Latino's). As the author makes clear, 1920's gang members were known for toughness and delinquency. Still, the gangs of the 1920's weren't nationally affiliated, nor were they heavily into guns and illegal drug sales. It also seems that gang members of the 1920's were mostly teenagers - today many are well into adulthood.This book was updated in 1963, and today there is an award in the author's name (set up in 1992) to honor leadership in the fight to make our society safer from violent gangs."
5,"Great TV, But you better have the funds!!","Very thin, but it does not weight 1lb. The price will go down in the future, but if you want to be the first one in town to get it, you will have to pay. You get a great pic from any angle in the room. Great sound!!"
1,Much ado about nothing....,"Disjointed, poorly written. Ending of book leaves lots of loose ends. Author has poor command of English language, and even less of Spanish..."
5,have read all of her books and find them entertaining,reading her books take me away from the everyday blahs and i enjoy reading sequels as well having a cuban lover would be the banansa keep on writing barabara and i'll keep on reading
2,For fans of Cuban politics and opera,"This was my first Barbara Parker book. Maybe if I'd read the earlier entries in the series I'd have felt some affection for the main couple, but none developed during ""Suspicion of Deceit."" They, along with a large cast of unappealing characters, never tell the same story twice, so it's hard to know where the truth lies - or to care. I was simply bored through most of it, and by the time the action picked up it didn't matter much who did what to whom."
2,Not Parker's Best in this Series-Too Many Politics.,"Gail and Anthony are about to be married but not without problems and doubts. When a case comes along involving Thomas Nolan, trouble is on the rise. Nolan is a big opera star, and everyone in Miami wants to kick him out. That is simply because of terrorism from Cubans in the past. And when Gail begins the filing of a lawsuit, bad things begin to happen. Gail is badly hurt and nearly killed a few times when she tries to find out what is going on behind these killing sprees. She has her eye on Felix Castillo, Thomas's bodyguard, but that changes when other clues to the mystery come up, and near the end a bombing occurs in a building where Gail is, and Felix is hurt right along with her.There was a lot of politics in the book, and since I am not a fan of politics, it bored me a bit though I managed to find parts of it interesting enough to finish the book."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"As a huge Barbara Parker fan, I was slightly disappointed by this book; it is my least favorite of her novels for the following reasons: 1. The discussion of Anthony's militant past in his college years -- his radical youth was hardly interesting and was in such great contrast to his present, suave exterior that I found it difficult to reconcile the two. 2. The amount of detail about Cuban politics; I frankly found it confusing and difficult to follow after a while. Parker obviously researched the topic extensively, but there was just so much INFORMATION! It felt like I was back in school after a while.Believe me, I tried to like this book, because I like Barbara Parker's other books so much, but I just didn't go for it. I would recommend any of the other ""Suspicion"" books or my favorite, ""Criminal Justice."" Barbara Parker is a great writer, so don't miss her other books!"
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I have enjoyed previous Barbara Parker books as well her characters Gail and Anthony. I am also a major fan of the great collection of Florida mystery writers. This book misses for me for the same reasons other Sunshine State writers have. When they get into the Cuban exile politics my interest wanders. If I want political intrigue, I'll read a political intrigue novel. But, when I pick up a mystery novel by a familiar writer I have no patience for the exile story. Miami has more than enough murder, mystery and crime to draw upon (log on the Miami Herald)and keep readers turning pages without politicizing the Cuban migration. On the plus side, Ms.Parker draws wonderfully clear characters and paints outstanding word pictures of Dade County. When she keeps it to the courtroom procedure and amateur sleuthing I find her books far more compelling."
2,Slow Going,"I have enjoyed the characters, Gail Conner and Anthony Quintana in previous Parker novels, but they weren't strong enough to carry this one. The plot was weak and largely uninteresting. The slow pace led to an ending without surprises. Not much here to recommend."
1,"Poor quality, and not-working equipment","It just quit working one day. No power-on and the screen is black.In internet you can find that this is a common issue for LG monitors. I have never thought that the electronics could be so bad quality.Support in Canada! Kidding me? This is Asian company - they talk a lot and do nothing. Or you can spend so much resources, that it would be better to buy new device.LG produces the worst electronics ever. Do not trust the advertisement. LG`s equipment just stopped work in some day. Never buy LG products!"
4,Great in bathroom!,"These look great in my bathroom!!! Instead of sticking them directly on the wall, I put them on a piece of thick black posterboard...it really made them pop with a black background!!"
4,wish I knew,"I purchased this for a gift,so don't have any idea of it's quality. I gave it four stars because I hate to badmouth, what may be a good product."
3,A Christmas Classic,"I purchased this CD because my local choral group is performing these songs for this year's Christmas Concert. Although the recording is rather dated, the content is timeless. Shaw's composition puts a unique spin on the the classics by weaving them together with capivating rhythms leading to a spashy finish."
5,Christmas Classic,"Prompt service, flawless condition, for my favorite arrangement of Christmas music by the great Robert Shaw.It's the meaning of Christmas for me."
1,not worth it,"I purchased this sprinkler as a gift. I recently learned that while the water distance was great, it only worked for 2, I repeat, 2 uses! I am very unhappy with the fact that I wasted my money on this product..."
4,Treo 700P Second Edition,"This book covers the things that should have been covered by the manuals that come with the Treo. Well illustrated and clearly written, but there is no real ""extra"" material inside. It does cover some of the accessories and software available from the secondary market however.I guess I was hoping for some of the tricks and hacks that I've seen on the web to be collected into this book.If you are new to the Treo and Palm OS, this is still a good resource to learn with."
4,More Treo...,Ive advanced past the Treo now but it was my first venture into smartphones. I wanted to learn about the functionality of that fun communication device and remember it as being complete including tricks for easier use.
3,TOO MUCH,"THE BOOK WAS GOOD BUT I WANTED A PHONE I COULD OPERATE. THE PHONE DOES TOO MUCH, BUT THE BOOK TELLS YOU HOW TO OPERATE IT. THIS REVIEW IS ON THE BOOK AND THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD, AND IN GOOD SHAPE. THE PHONE IS TOO MUCH AND I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A MUCH SIMPLER PHONE. I HAD A SAMSUNG XV8300 AND I LOST IT. I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY OLD PHONE BACK."

2,Superficial scholarship,"The central claim of this book--that France is actually adapting to globalization (whatever that means) better than the political rhetoric might suggest--is counter-intuitive and interesting. However, it is superficially researched and lumps together public opinion, social movements, interest groups, trade policy, etc., as if they were acting in the same field and part of a single, homogeneous phenomenon. Although the overview of trade debates in several sectors is interesting, the authors reduce antiglobalization politics in France to a nostalgic longing for French 'grandeur'. Such a label is perhaps applicable to some sectors of the French elite (Chevenement, Seguin, Pasqua) but certainly not to the wide variety of social movements and associations that focus on the democratic deficit and the increase of inequalities."
5,"A ""must""!","""The French Challenge"" is a MUST for anybody who wants to understand contemporary France. This is provocative book which has many insights into the love/hate relationship of the French with globalization. A very solid piece of work and a great read."
3,An OK read,"I was in high school when I first read this book, and while it's obviously not the greatest romance novel I ever read, it was good enough that I remember it 11 years later. If I still had my copy, I would most likely reread it.I believe Julie Miller is now primarily a Harlequin writer, and that's not typically my brand of preference when it comes to romance novels. However, this was Miller's first published novel and a contemporary/paranormal one at that. I'd say for a first attempt, it was pretty darn good."
3,Zipper is weakest link,I had inadvertently lost the key to the pouch and when I got to my destination I was able to insert the can opener attachment of my pocket knife into the metal zipper and pop a few of the teeth and then simply pull open the pouch. This is not a maximum security device; if you need that a strong box would be suggested. It serves its designed purpose fairly well.
5,Great for storage!,"I love this security bag, grated I only get into the bag once a month. I can only contest that it's a better bag, than your cheaper off-brand bags."
5,Night Deposit Bag,"The bags were a good product for the price, I have been checking around and have seen some outrageous prices! I was a little skeptical at first but after receiving them in lightning fast shipment I was very happy with the purchase!"
2,Mediocre,"These bags are of mediocre quality, but my biggest complaint is that once you unlock the bag, you cannot remove the key! This is a problem if you do not want the person who is filling the bag to have access to it once it is filled. This is my case. I want a person to be able to take an unlocked and open bag, put their nightly deposit in the bag, and place it in a drop. I don't want to have to issue each cashier a key to each bag (or their own bag) just to they can close it and make the drop. Hence, these are useless unless everyone involved with their use has a key.Otherwise, the quality is not Great, and their size is standard."
4,IT IS VERY GOOD SAFE SECURITY,"MMF2330881W08 BAG,NT DP,11X8.5,DUCK,W/LKTHIS IS SAFE SECURITY GREAT !!!!"
4,Very Good Shooter,"Fear is definitely the next generation in shooters. Very entertaining. The detailed graphics are just about the best ever. The AI is off the scale. At one point an enemy jumped through a first floor window to protect himself, then came up through the window shooting. Creepy at times - but not quite like Doom or Quake 4. It was a bit redundant -- most of the game involved walking around hallways. Quite a bit of gore -- I could never let the shotgun go -- I loved the damage it did. The slo-mo effect is kinda cool -- very handy when in a fire fight. I had it set as my right mouse button and used it quite often.The expansion pack, Extraction Point was even better. A few additional cool weapons, and a bit more diversity with the levels -- but much more creepy and gory -- probably the most gore I have ever seen in a game (not like there's anything wrong with that). Nothing quite like walking around a bloody, dark morgue.I highly recommend this game."
3,"Alright I suppose, nothing to right home about...","Some thrills, some chills, some spooky affects but all in all nothing to write home about. Guess it sold enough copies to warrant a soon to be released sequel BUT I won't be signing up anytime soon. Still this game does provide some marvelous weapons, the Ice Gun is one of my faves as are the landmines and turrets, but other than that, it's been there... done that.Da Worfster"
4,Great CD,"Great CD, some great selections. I recall from the news that this was quite an important trip for the LDS people. Congrats on a great concert."
4,Interesting read,"Lots and lots of research from this journalist! This would be great read for any would-be physician (like me) who is interested in delivering the best quality care. True, it does drag in the middle. So much information gets to you and you sort of become numb to the outcomes research statistics. In the end, the pace is picked up a little."
2,HMO propaganda ingoring the perils of managed care,"The Author's approach set forth in this book is to drown the reader in a sea of useless statistics. The anecdotes provided offer little conclusive proof to support the exalted claims postulated. This book suffers from tunnel vision all the while, it leads the reader down a laborious path of drawn out conclusions. If one were to accept the conclusions set forth in this book, they would be accepting HMOs as their advocate and their doctor as an egotist looking out only for their own needs."
4,Historically accurate but still misses the mark,"Millensen provides an insightful and historical view of the evolution of managed care (or managed competition). However, as a professional who can uniquely view the medical arena from both sides, he misses the point...managed care is here because educated baby boom generation demand more autonomy in their medical decision making, all the while supporting their medical and non-medical peers who have found profit in the system too hard to resist...we want it all."
1,Album files are corrupted in the amazon store.,"The album would get a 4 star rating for me except for the fact i cant listen to the whole album.Track 7 is corrupt. I have contacted amazon but they are not correcting the issue. Sadly the itunes version is corrupted too.I found the CD on ebay for 20 and the uncorrupted version is great.AMAZON, Please pull this cd or correct track 7."
5,"Great stand, wish I purchased much earlier","This mount is excellent - easy to assemble, sturdy in operation, reasonably priced and has a great range of motion. I mounted a 26"" Asus monitor which was well above suggested size limit, but under the weight limit. The stand hold the monitor perfectly and allows me to move this beast of a monitor around my desk (or even over the edge of it) with ease.I can't beleive I wasted so many years fiddling with OEM/included monitor stands when this product was available. From now on every new monitor in my house will be VESA mount capable and mounted on an Ergotron mount"
5,Best Stand for any price****,"I have the Samsung 22""wide screen and this stand is perfect!!!Easy to install and adj 5 stars +.Samsung 226BW 22-Inch Digital/Analog Widescreen LCD Monitor (Black)"
5,Exactly what I needed,"The product is as solid as I could have hoped for. The metal components are very heavy and well constructed. The plastic feels solid and reliable. The flexible plastic does not feel like it's going to break when being bent. The adjustable spring tension meant even my heavy 24"" Dell LCD was supported without any issues.The spacing for the cables is tight when you have power and video, but they both fit snugly, keeping the desk clear of cable-clutter.The instructions are easy to follow and come in a large variety of languages. All the necessary components were included, including a plate for larger monitors. The monitor arm was very easy to assemble.Definitely a recommended purchase - I'll only buy these monitor arms in the future, and will recommend them to anyone that asks."
1,Too Cheap for Me,"The quality of this arm was disappointing. The lower part of the arm is painted metal while the upper arm has really ugly plastic trim. The pivot mechanism is just plain cheap. I returned it immediately and bought a 30"" extended SwingArm made by Workrite Ergonomics for $219. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Very disappointed,"I did a lot of research prior to make up my mind and finally decided to go with Ergotron LX Desk Mount Arm. The product which i got later is very disapointing. I have a samsung 19' widescreen monitor, the Ergotron LX just couldn't lift it up, it is brand new and the monitor keeps dropping to the ground. I am very unhappy with this product!"
4,Excellent support arm,"I have this for close to a month and am loving it. It's bought to support a 24"" LCD monitor and doing a great job at it. I first try the clamp type mount at the edge of the desk, only to find its footing being readily shifted when I move the monitor about. The weight of the monitor may be the greatest contributor to the matter. I ended up using the drill-through-the-table mount_be careful and plan accordingly before drilling if you had an expensive desk to deal with. Also note that the center of the foot of the mount needs to face squarely to the position of the monitor. Otherwise, you would see it weighs heavily on the side the monitor is at. Only minor details one must pay attention to. Other than those, this mount looks and works great on my desk. It's quite awesome that the monitor can be completely moved out of the way when needed."
