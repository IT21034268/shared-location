2,okay but not great,"I needed a new case fan and based on the price and decent reviews I decided that this fan was worth a shot. It does the job, but its by no means quiet. Now, its not the loudest fan either, but its close. I'm getting by with it for the time being, but at some point I'm probably going to replace it with something quieter. If your looking for something inexpensive and don't mind the noise, this is perfect, if not you should probably spend a bit more and get something better."
3,Caddyshack/Blazing Saddles [2 Discs],"Two outstanding films, however the DVD packaging is made of cardboard and cheap plastic instead of the standard plastic DVD case we have grown accustomed to. I would suggest you purchase a couple of DVD cases if you want to protect your investment.I deducted 2 stars because of poor packaging."
5,Wow,"Yes, this was written many years ago and as such some of the details would be different if written today--big deal. Like much greate science fiction this is a novel of people and ideas and in many ways, still as relevant today as it was then. Still a great read if you love science fiction."
2,Mixed up pages,"This was one of my favorite books, and I bought a newer copy for my students to read as well. Imagine my surprise when I read the book, and found out that the last pages of the second part of the book were missing, and replaced by the middle of the book being repeated. I know how it ends, but it is useless to put in my classroom library. Seller should have flipped through the book before sending it out."
2,Treat With Caution.,"I've got to admit to being a real fan of classic SF but find that, while some bears up very well with the passage of time, some fares much less well. This has dated very badly and while there a few excellent underlying notions it is impossible to ignore the clunky technology and out-moded social ideas that inform the work.This is almost certainly a work of 'historical importance' within the SF field and it is that alone, I feel, which explains why it was placed so highly in the 'SF Masterworks' series(one of the things that nudged me into reading it) but I can't recommend it as a reading experience.Whatever you do don't make this your first journey into 'Classic SF' try Dick(The Man in the High Castle), Bester(The Stars My Destination), Asimov(Foundation),Clarke(The City and the Stars)..."
3,RE : They Shall Have Stars,"...Mr. Blish obviously whiffed badly by making it seem that McCarthyism would consume the United States, but oddly enough has proven right about our losing our drive toward interstellar travel. The characters are somewhat one dimensional and the story's a bit underwritten. It has very much the feel of an author who's more interested in what's to come than in this introductory bit. But if Blish isn't quite up to the standards of the three giants of the Golden Age of Science Fiction-- Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clarke--he's at least a capable practitioner of the space opera genre.GRADE : C+"
5,A classic comes to the e-book,"This is one of my favorite anthologies. Some places show their age, much like the classic Lensman series, where teck has evolved on a different track from that envisioned by the author. This does not in any way detract from the story line and impact of the overall story.I think every Sci-Fi fan should read this book and now that it's available on the Kindle, it is easy to have with you when you have a few spare minutes for a quick read. Not to mention it's much lighter to carry around on the Kindle than it was in print."
4,Finally on Kindle...,"Blish's classic vision of stellar migration and man's place in the cosmos finally comes to Kindle. It's a bit dated in places but is still a good read and a wonderful example of the genre from the 1950s to early 1960s. _They Shall have Stars_ and _Earthman, Come Home_ are the best component stories but the entire set holds together well considering they were written over a seven year span as separate novels. Every SF reader, particularly fans of ""hard SF"", should appreciate the history of spindizzies. If only we had real spindizzy drives to (literally) lift us out of this current economic mess and follow the Okie path to the stars."
5,Perfect Science Fiction,"An enthralling book that I've read many times. My copy, too, is falling apart although I still have all of the pages.Easton Press prints high-quality leather-bound books and has done science fiction too. This book is my candidate for them. We should all request them to include it."
5,An amusing prediction of NYC's future,"Imagine Earth's cities ripping themselves free of the Earth, flying through interstellar space like bees, pollenating distant planets with new technology. Interesting that our current science is developing rejuvinating therapies to extend lifetimes as we speak. Cities in Flight predicted this event. Wide scope, with charming soundrels for leaders; much like NYC today. I would like to be a citizen of a city with a motto like, ""Mow your lawn, Lady?"""
5,AWE INSPIRING!,I first read this book whilst I was serving in the Royal Navy. It helped pass many hours of boring travelling between ports. I must have read it about 10 times and never found anything predictable about it. Unfortunately it eventually fell apart and I no longer have a copy. The story is an act of genius and the Fiction is of the purest Science. I'm certainly no scientist but it had me convinced. John Amalfi for world president? I wish! Please re-publish...I beg you Mr Blish!
4,A bit dated technologically but a masterful piece of work nonetheless!,"My review title really says it all. It gave me much the same enjoyment that the original Star Wars did (in the sense of flitting around the universe having adventures (both traditional and more entertainingly - political). Quite simply, it's just a lot of fun. Not too many characters, which means it stands entirely on plot and good (intriguing) ideas. Gets a bit plain towards the end but I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good old fashioned space journeys to ""strange new worlds"" (the astute reader will feel the same heady adventurism of 'Foundation's Edge' and 'Foundation and Earth' by Asimov)."
5,Hobos in space,"When the 'Okie novels' were written we humans mostly had an entirely misplaced vision of the 'future' we're all living now. We were going to be living in domed cities, each having his own airplane and living on pills. Hobo cities in space were far easier to believe, and early SF was about predicting how we'd be living in the future, things that 'might happen'. But while the Okie Cities concept is no longer valid, SFs changed to accomodate it. Finally we can just relax and enjoy a great writer and a series of yarns to take you away from the future you're having to live as we never believed it would be.That's what I recommend you do."
4,oldie but goodie,The science is dated but is still a good read. The first 3 of the 4 are better. Good value.
1,Save your money!,"This was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. It was suppossed to be an instructional video, but what little bit of actual instruction there was is virtually useless. It showed a few sequences of the pros riding, followed by them reading from a teleprompter some useless instructions of how to accomplish the technique. If you like being bored to tears and wasting your money, then buy this video, otherwise, I would recommend Ned Overend's video ""Performance Mountain Biking"" or ""West Coast Style"" for the more extreme techniques."
3,Weak on the nuclear issue,"While Pollack admits that he doesn't speak Farsi etc, the weakest part of the books is on the nuclear issue. Some of his claims about the existence of a nuclear weapons program in Iran are fallacious & specious at best, and also totally disregard the economic legitimacy for Iran of having access to an independent nuclear power program."
3,Well researched but one thing (at least),The USA did not stop Saddam Hussein during his Anfal Campaign (which he dreadfully tried Kurdish genocide) due to the USA's own huge pacifist movement of the late 60's/early 70's which left the USA largely incapable of taking on the military of a nation even as strong as Iraq. Pollack would have done better to have remembered this as he coldly claims the USA didn't care much about the Iraqi Kurds. And we for sure discouraged Saddam about his beating on the Kurds. It was the Cold War and the Soviets would've encouraged Saddam to do even worse than he did on the Kurds.
1,Bias,"This book has numerous flaws in accurately portraying Iran and its conflict with America, but the most important is the bias of the author. Mr. Pollack writing a book about Iran is like having your worst enemy write your biography. In a nutshell this is a highly biased book by a man who has strong ties to the American Israeli Poliitical Action Committee and was named for a time in an indictment by the U.S. government as an national security advisor in the Clinton administration that provided secret information to high ranking Israeli AIPAC employees. He also works at the Saban Institute which is named after and run by Haim Saban who is who is an Israeli billionaire who is generally believed to use his hefty campaign donations to further the Israeli cause.There is no problem if your beliefs are the same, but just know you'll be reading a book which isn't accurate and more likely to fall under the category of propaganda."
3,needed editing,"As a former US federal employee and researcher/editor/writer myself, I recommend better and tighter writing AND much more editing. Too much repetition,and not enough historical foundation about the area and its peoples. They deserve more credit for who they are and for their very long history."
2,disappointed,"after reading the reviews by other amazon buyers and being a big thunderbird fan i bought the book. i am really glad i only paid a few dollars. while its fairly good reading the majority of the color pictures appear out of focus and for some reason dark. the black and whites appear good. as a collector of automobile books i rarely see pictures this bad, especially in a anniversary edition."
3,actually uses the hit recordings!,"This CD is short, with just ten tracks and a 24-minute playing time, but it's one of the better skimpy CDs that I've heard. It includes what are probably the duo's best-known hits (""Surf City,"" ""Little Old Lady From Pasadena,"" ""Dead Man's Curve,"" ""New Girl In School,"" ""Ride The Wild Surf,"" etc.). The only pre-""Surf City"" track here is ""Linda."" The last track, ""You Really Know How To Hurt A Guy,"" is probably the least-known song here. It's a slow ballad (J&D aren't exactly one of those acts who are most known for their ballads), and it isn't really great, but I think it's O.K. I personally like longer CDs better, but I do think this is a good CD. It does actually use the hit recordings of the songs, unlike a lot of other J&D best-of's out there, which use versions that were recorded much later than the hit versions and don't even feature Jan. That's a big part of why I gave it three stars."
3,Overall opion,"I guess to me that cd with only 3 stars in the rating is tell me that it may be a good one to by if there wasn't any other choices to buy, being that there a group with beach surfin songs like The Beach Boys so no a fence to them but, if there wasn't for them than I would have been more willing to I purchase the album."
5,How 2 Study Law hits the Mark with Law Students,"I recently enrolled in Law School and discovered How 2 Study Law and bought it right away. I read it cover to cover in about an hour. I was really happy to see such an organized, easy-to-read approach to an overwhelming task. I particularly appreciated the thoughts on how to improve one's concentration and getting the definitions memorized methodology.The authors have chosen a style, format and content that encourages the student to endure the process with a very sensible approach that respectfully doesn't take a lot of time to incorporate into an already demanding schedule.I just really want everyone to know when an author hits the mark with new students, as there is such a plethora of information for students to buy products which they may not need or use. My thanks for such sage and sound advice and I look forward to seeing Mr. Springfield's future presentations."
3,Good for kids of all ages,I had the vhs on this movie and wanted to upgrade. It is a perfect addition to my dvd collection. It is a heart warming twist to history that every age will enjoy.
4,Prophetical Walk Through the Holy Land,"I purchased this book for my mom. It was a great value for the price; however, the cover was torn more than what I thought it would be according to the description."
1,Full of the worst sort of modernism,"I am currently in an R.C.I.A. program that uses this book. Unfortunatly, this book has very little to commend it and makes one long for the good ol' days of the Index. Among the heresies that it promotes are 1) fundemental option theory 2) subtle arguments for the ordination of women 3)No mention of the Church's ban on contraception. Worse than all of this is the contempt the author seems to have for 2,000 years of Church history. Tradition is relegated to the dust bin...example That the mature Catholic must have faith that is built on the latest ""theological trends"". Funny, I thought one must have faith that is solidly built on Jesus Christ and the Church He founded. Save your money and your soul by not buying this piece of herectical trash."
5,Great Ep,"New Found Glory are pretty well known for being a great cover band, and this ep pretty much shows just exactly how good of a cover band they actually are. If you want to hear a great covers ep, check out this album. Its short, its cheap, and its just all out a great album. Be sure to check out New Found Glory's other albums as well. They are all great. NEW ALBUM OUT THIS SUMMER!"
4,Great Songs,"They did these songs really good . Im really happy about the neverending story one , i love that movie .."
5,good stuff,"A New Found Glory took a big risk in my opinion by releasing an EP of covers so early in their career, but they pulled it off and made a great album. I heard this album only twice before i bought it, and that was once more than was needed to convince me that this was a great new band at the beginning of the next big thing in music, and we really need something new to come along."
4,Very Good transition of movie songs,"First off let me say that whats on this CD is great. The first time i heard 'neverending story' on it i had to get it. I found the other songs to be great too, especially 'the glory of love' and 'that thing you do'. the only gripe i had when i bought this CD was that there was only 18 min of music on the whole CD, but then again, it was only $8. oh well. But for what is on it, definetly pick this one up. very good"
4,"Go for it, this CD is a good time","Any true fan of New Found Glory has this CD and will tell you they're hoping and praying for the day the band does another EP of cover songs. NFG takes classic easy-listening songs from movies and puts their own spin on it. The results will make you smile, rock out, tap your foot, nod your head, maybe even laugh. This CD marked the end of the raw sound and minimal production for the band. This EP wouldn't be the same if it didn't sound like it was recorded in someone's basement. Jordan's voice still sounds like he's singing in the shower, which is not to say that he sings off-key. Buy this CD, blast it in your car with the windows down, and laugh at all the people staring at you, jealous that you're having such a good time."
5,They are at the top,Another great album from A New Found Glory. If you liked the other albums and if you love them you must buy this one. Only con is it a bit short about 18 minutes. Anyway you will like it.
5,From the Screen to Your Stereo to Me loving it.,"If you have great taste in music, then you probably already have or is buying it right....now. don't wait to buy this cd. Its the best New Found Glory cd out. It acually made the Celion Dion song sound good--""My Heart will go on"". ""Never Ending Story"" is my favorite song because on the great catchy tune. ""The Gonnies R good enough"" is a song i can listen to over and over. This group can make a wicked remake on songs from movies especially the Armageddon song. I hated the lyrics, the song and everthing else but when i heard New Found Glory's remake, i was outstanded. 2 words to describe this cd, ""overwhelmingly awesome"""
3,"Right Songs, Wrong Band","Punk covers have always amused me to no end - I am a big fan of Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies. When I heard that a band called New Found Glory did punk covers of such songs as ""Neverending Story"" and ""My Heart Will Go On"" I had to buy the CD. Indeed the songs are fun, but I have some problems with the sound. For example - the lead singers voice is too quiet and hollow sounding. No dount he is singing loudly, but I don't like his voice, and I don't think it was mixed properly with the instruments.If you like punk covers, I recommend this album, but I can't help thinking that someone like Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies would have come out with a better sounding product."
1,the puff daddy of punk,"thank god that amazon lets you listen to cd's before you purchase them. i am from phoenix,az and i can't believe that this would be considered a popular album anywhere in the world much less in the state of arizona. thats pretty sickening. i thought this band was pretty damn good until i heard this album. i am still in disbelief that a band would even think of remaking the song from the titanic. kind of a bad career decision."
1,"Heartless, Lifeless, Souless; the tale of a musical joke","this cd? is a joke...why it is in national stores, and available for anyone to hear is beyond my belief. sounds like crap, no time or thought was put into it, and is really really horrible... Recommendations : Elvis Costello, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Radiohead, The Who, Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, The Cars, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Weezer, bloom., Subrosa, Springsteen, and the unreleased Nada Surf is quite tasty also. STOP wasting your energy on this sloppy, so-called ""music,"" and put forth the effort into quality artists who can actually can be life changing. SINCERELY, BOOKER-T"
5,Great lost album,"Really catchy, heavy/mellow (is that possible?) rock from this Trance Syndicate band. Austin locals, Monroe Mustang's album is quite good and worth a listen. Very enjoyable."
3,One track... but what a track!,"Although a couple of its members went on to much better things with the Atlanta Rhythm Section, most of Classics IV's late 60's music falls squarely into the ""not really worth the effort"" drawer. But... in amongst their catalogue of distinctly MOR white soul there is one quite brilliant track: ""Spooky"". Featuring a ridiculously catchy organ riff, beautifully atmospheric vocals, a wonderfully gutsy sax break and a chugging bass line that sounds as though it was recorded in the studio's broom cupboard it was, and still is, instantly unforgettable. Straight to No 1 in the USA and lost without trace in the UK it was voted by Brian Wilson no less as the best single ever made in UK's ""Mojo"" magazine several years ago (modesty itself as he actually holds the title with ""Good Vibrations"") and fully justifies the cost of this album on its own. Alternatively, hunt it down on one of several 60's compilations. Either way, you won't regret it!"
4,Great 60's Music,"I bought this CD to fill in my collection with some favorite 60's tunes. ""Spooky"" is their best song and very pleasant to listen to now and then. There are two other cuts I also like to hear: ""Stormy"" and ""Traces"". The rest of the material is a cut below - but not offensive. There is a unique quality to the singer's voice that I like. This CD is worth a buy."
4,underrated,"This band gets a bad rap. Tell your fellow King Crimson or Magma fans that you like to listen to ""Stormy"" or ""Spooky"" every now and again, and they are red in the face, laughing at you. You're off buying your 18th Larks Tounges remater, just to reestablish your hippness.Ok. ""Traces"" is sappy and ridiculus, but, like the two other hits, there is a nice, bouncy bossa flavor to the song. This stuff has vibraphones, and nice jazzy rythms that you would not hear on a Gary Pucket or Bobby Goldsboro record. Listen to the guitarist: he has a nice, Wes Montgommery comp style, and a lot of this material would not sound out of place on a Jobim LP.I am not going to take this out once a day, or even once every six months, but as far as 60s AM pop stanards go, this stuff goes down nice and easy."
4,Great!,"I got this for my brother and he loved it, more than he expected. It really stirred some wonderful memories."
1,Horrible quality,"I read the poor reviews before I purchased, but decided I would order anyway. I just wanted something I could play with my kids on occasion. No real need for top quality.When I received and opened the (undamaged)box, there were screws everywhere, loose in the box. At first I thought I would just get a screwdriver and put the screws back in and tighten them. The problem is the screws had been stripped out of the pressboard base of the table. There was no way to get the screws to tighten.I am making do with it as is. The hassle of returning for refund or replacement is just something I don't have time for.Bottom line, the workmanship and quality as delivered is horrible."
4,Fun for small spaces,"This is a great mini ping pong table for rooms that are not large enough for a fullsize version. For the price (we paid $99 w/ free ship) we have loved having it and thoroughly enjoyed it! Even my 6'4"" husband enjoys the cut down table - much to his surprise! You just have to adjust your game a little!"
1,Upset,"I ordered this product and was emailed back hours later saying that it was back ordered and that my money would not be returned for 2-3 business days. This is ridiculous and disappointing, and I will not buy from here again."
4,Better than the negative reviews here...,"It might be a little cheap but I've had mine for 4 years now and I still love it. We have great games on it, and I definitely consider this a good buy for the price. If space is an issue this is a great choice. It also folds up easily and will fit in any car trunk....take it with you wherever you want!"
1,Dog can't stand!,Don't buy it! Looks so cute on the picture and it would be fun and age appropriate etc. BUT the dog can't stand. Those bendable legs do nothing but bend and the dog lies flat on his belly all the time. Immediate frustration for a toddler!!!
1,not designed properly,This a cool looking toy but it just doesn't work. The head and body pieces are simply too heavy to be supported by the legs so they always fall over. Very dissapointing and frustrating for the kids.
2,not very satisfy with the product,I thought animals are bigger in size. These are very small animals. I would never buy any toys on the internet.
3,instructions not so good,"after two weeks, I am still hoping the filter will work and clear the water. Very convenient, but it came with filter encased in plastic. After a week with water still cloudy I realized I had to remove the plastic. Then I failed to notice the instructions stuck to the back of he filter cartridge. Water still cloudy. Removed instructions. Usually instructions are outside the item. Still hoping for clear water."
2,O.K,I got this item today and im not impressed.the first thing that happened is that cloud's leg came off and I swear there is no way to put it back on without using glue.If you do use glue cloud wont be able to move his leg.his hair is REALLY messed up and looks almost nothing like clouds hair.he doesn't have that much of flexibility so you have to be really delicate.the sword is great....but there is a part you take on and off to make him hold the sword which can really break the handle of the sword.he comes with a hand that he can hold the sword with.the Fenri looks great and realistic but it is really hard to put cloud on it without breaking him.and it doesn't include the ability to store cloud's sword.
3,Dissapointed,"This is a poorly made figure. His legs broke off after mounting him on the bike. They could have done so much better. His sculpt is pretty accurate to the movie, but they could have used a sturdier design, like Squall's. The only thing that's great about this one is that it comes with the Fenrir. That's a pretty neat figure all on its own."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Awesome for any man cave, will not be disappointed in quality or craftsmanship. If you love FFVII or just Cloud in general, this is for you. I now have both from VII and Advent children w/bikes. Absolutely love them, I keep them out of the sun to prevent stripping of paint."
4,Horace Walpole would approve,"Unlike many so-called spiritual books, this one is actually interesting to read & does not annoyingly cross reference other spiritual books as if they were primary sources. The word serendipity was coined by Horace Walpole (1717-1797)& derives from an old, somewhat longwinded ""silly fairy tale"" (Walpole's words) of Persian origin. Serendip was the old name for Sri Lanka where the tale starts. This book is a plea for slowing down & smelling the flowers in a somewhat disciplined way, thereby opening oneself up to the possibility of inspiration, intuition, guidance (what you will). It employs history, myth & poetry (of sorts) in a jaunty amalgam that's both fun to read & inspirational. Not at all self righteous - recommended."
4,A good beginner's guide to yoga,"I have enjoyed doing the flow yoga on this DVD. I think the trick is to not emulate everything Shiva Rea does, but to work at one's own pace and gently learn the movements without over-doing them. I have had a lot of success with this routine and find it very helpful for the breathing techniques it develops also."
4,great intro to flow yoga,"I've done yoga off and on for about 8 years now. I enjoy this DVD. My only complaint is that it is broken up into individual segments, so it only ""flows"" sporadically, but I suppose that is appropriate since this is for beginners. Flow yoga is physically challenging (that's why I got this ""beginner"" DVD), so the breaks between each flow are nice for those who may not be able to make it through the whole routine. Shiva Rea is an amazingly youthful and energetic instructor, and I find her style very easy to follow and motivating. I will likely purchase another DVD of hers in the future."
3,Flow Yoga,"All I can say is that it was okay. The segments were a bit long and uninspiring. Overall better than the aerobic yoga programs out there, but not quite what I was looking for."
5,A great introduction to Yoga from an amazing teacher,This is one of the most beautifully shot dvds I have ever seen. Shiva's voice is calming and helpful as I learn this yoga practice. I have been doing this almost every morning before work and what a great way to start my day.
3,"Good, but fast","I bought this looking for a good beginners yoga DVD. I have done yoga in a studio a few times, and have a strong dance background, but I wanted to get something to start off slow, especially since my boyfriend was willing to try it with me. I really liked the instructor and the poses, but she went through everything really quickly, and she didn't really help explain what you should be doing very well. I spoke with my friend's mom, who is very experienced with yoga, and she recommended Rodney Yee'sPower Yoga: Strength and Flexibilityas a better beginner's DVD. I have borrowed it from her, but haven't tried it yet."
3,To fast for TRUE beginners!,"I am a beginner at yoga! I have only did it once or twice.I have heard so much about Shiva Rea, but this DVD was much to fast and complicated for me. She went from move to move without even explaining what she was doing & how she did it. It was almost like she was physically saying ""You know these poses, so now do them"". I was also expecting her to slowly move into the more difficult poses,but NO..she didnt.I ultimately had to quit on her.Just because you talked slowly Shiva Rea does not mean this DVD is for beginners."
4,"Great DVD, but not for beginners to yoga","The cover of this DVD proclaims, ""No yoga experience necessary"", but I don't believe it. Someone new to yoga couldn't possibly keep up with the moves; nor would they know the ""lingo"" to understand what some of the instructions are.The scenes are filmed in some amazing places, and the soundtracks that go along with the instructions are wonderful. You have the choice to hear just the soundtrack, or the soundtrack and the instruction. The video editing leaves a lot to be desired though. Too many cuts make an otherwise relaxing experience seem jarring.Two strikes against it, but I'll still give it four out of five stars. As I said, I like the music, and I love the background scenery. It doesn't have the ""workout"" feel that a lot of yoga DVDs have. There is almost no repetition; just move after move showing you lots of flow yoga moves. It makes yoga look relaxing and calm, where a lot of DVDs make it seem like a training video for a yoga army."
3,Not for beginners!,"I love this yoga DVD for its beautiful settings and music. It is very atmospheric and really helps create a mood of relaxation. However, there is no pose guide. Form is very important in exercise and Ms. Rea provides little to no guidance in terms of safe practice. I strained my hip and low back from one of the twist poses I apparently executed incorrectly. I have been practicing yoga for beginners with a Rodney Yee DVD for over a year, so it was not my first time. Otherwise, I highly recommend this DVD to those who already know what they are doing."
2,not what it said it was,"This is supposed to be for beginners and it is not! The moves are too advanced, she does not explain well and moves too quickly from pose to pose. The music is annoying - drum-beaty like."
3,Good if you do not have Osteoporosis!,"I have done Yoga for years, and this is pretty good.I now have osteoporosis, and cannot do allot of the poses. I cannottwist at the waist, and do some of the moving, bending down poses.It is good for beginners."
2,"Beautifully produced, but NOT for beginners","Given the excellent production value, this is everything I'd want in a yoga video. Unfortunately, it is far too advanced for beginners.I really wanted to like it. Shiva Rea has a calming, elegant voice, the nature setting is gorgeous, and the music is great. But I was ready to give up halfway through! I've taken yoga classes before, and now I'm in the process of becoming a serious student, practicing most days out of the week. I am 5'8, 120 lbs, exercise regularly, in my 20s...I'm not some huge weakling. But I feel like these poses were very advanced, and I needed more guidance and explanation than was offered.I would like to give this video 5 stars, but I think I'll have to wait a few years untiL I can enjoy doing a lot of these poses."
1,Very poor viewing quality,My grandmother downloaded this video hoping that she could watch it on her new computer.The video quality is HORRIBLE. The owners of this production should be ashamed at selling something so inferior. There is no way to get my grandmother's money back either because you cannot return digital downloads.
3,Good for novices - no good for experienced photographers,"This DVD should be titled ""Introduction to Basic Photographic Techniques & Camera Operation, with Specific Reference to the Olympus E-520"". As such, I would rate it 4 stars - & would probably not have purchased it! Being an avid amateur photographer (& one who enjoys becoming familiar with a new camera via a thorough study of its operating manual), I found this DVD to be a complete waste of time & money. Approximately half of the video is devoted to an explanation of basic camera operation & photographic techniques - the other half is simply a video presentation of much of what is contained in the supplied manual for the E-520. If you're a beginning photographer (especially one who doesn't like to read instruction manuals), this video would definitely be a worthwhile purchase. If you have a modicum of photographic experience & savvy, read the manual, save your money for a new lens, & spend your time making images!"
2,not worth the money,"I raced through this video in about 20 minutes, and I realized that there's nothing on this that you can't learn for free from either studying the manual or looking online. This was a big waste of my money."
4,The Killing Secret (True Stories Collection),This is a very good movie. I've seen a few times prior to purchasing it. I am glad to have it in my collection.
2,NOT the original recordings.,"FYI--these are not the original hit recordings, but newly recorded by BG. Liner notes state: ""All tracks were digitally mastered and RECORDED at the Soundshop Studios, Nashville, Tennessee, February 1999."" Look for another collection if you are looking for his original hit versions."
1,Remakes don't make it with me............,"Disapointed with the remake of ""Honey"" I heard but don't know if this is the one included on this disc. The producers used a different orchestra arragement, different voice influctions and even changed a word in the song. Can you guess where it is? Bobby sings ""now all I have IS memories of Honey, and I wake up nights and call her name."" The word has been changes to from IS to ARE. Even when I was a kid and heard this, I thought he should have used proper english."
1,Awful. My whole book club hated it.,"This book got a loud, unanimous thumbs-down from my 9-member book club. The woman who suggested it came to our discussion meeting deeply embarrassed and apologetic. I was so disgusted with all the references to sourness -- such as bile, vomit and rot -- that I started marking my book. I had hundreds of markings! We all hated the protagonist and his arrogant rantings. One member described Collins' writing as a ""pretension-fest."" The protagonist's relationships with and views of women are so dark and pathetic. This is really one of the worst books I've ever read, and I only finished it because it was a book club book. You'll need lots of breath mints and showers to get through it."
5,"Collins, The Keepers of Truth","The Keepers of Truth by Michael Collins is one of those books so full of the authors own opinions that it should have a brain-washing warning sticker on it to warn people who's brains are easily washed. Anyway, the story is interesting if not all that original. It is a murder mystery, but the way it is written and presented to us is what made this a five star read for me. Knowing the author helped make this even more fun as well. As I said, I can see this book angering some hard-core Americans. You know the ones I mean: people who take pride in their town and country no matter what. People like that probably wouldn't read a book like this which talks a lot about the decaying American Dream and so on and so on. The only scene that angered me was when the story's antagonist, Ronny Lawton, throws a bag of perfectly good Burger King food out the window in his hostage situation."
2,none too subtle,"This book definitely held my attention, but it's not close to being a 'great book'. Most of the characters--especially women--boil down to tired stereotypes. And the philosophical and political passages are heavy-handed and belabored. It reads like a pseudo-intellectual miniseries. Get 'The Corrections' if you want to read something with philosophical and political content that's done really well!"
3,More of a history book than how to book,"As a historian, I can appreciate this book. However, I purchased it as a gift for a 10 year old boy. The cover and title are EXTREMELY misleading. There is far more historical application of the process than actual how-to information. A better title would be ""Secrets of history and how they weren't told""...."
3,Structure designers read this!,"This book is great for the person who is just starting a web site. It includes help on every topic and is wonderful for content help. After reading this book you will not only have the confidence, but you will be able to put it into action. The only downfall is some descriptions of different aspects of the program are a little short and hard to understand, but well worth the read."
2,Enough is enough already!!!!!!!!!,"Many years ago Dame Ninette de Valois said to Richard Buckle that she thought everything that had been said about Diaghilev had already been said and how right she was.If ever a lemon was squeezed dry it was Diaghilev's.Please, everybody, enough is enough about Diaghilev."
1,It's a lovely coffee table book and that's about it.,"The paper is lovely and the photographs, well, I've seen them a hundred times before. It's a lovely coffee table book, anyone can look cultured if they have this is on display.I agree with other reviewers who think that a/it's enough about Diaghilev, and, b/the articles are almost too esoteric for words, and c/ Diaghilev would, indeed, not like all this intrusive, not to say, mis-conceived, in-depth analysis, of his world.I also have the feeling that the writers involved couldn't even pronounce Diaghilev's name correctly. Not to mention the profusion of errors of both facts and judgements with which this book is littered.Better luck next time, and remember, you can't fool all of the people all of the time!"
2,hmm....,the earring would have been better if it was smaller. they are about 1 inch long and very light in weight. not bad for the price tho! i just expected something a lot smaller.
4,A very good historical mystery.,"Knight creates a picture of 12th century England and explaining the system of justice without bogging down the story. I found myself caught up in the characters of Sir John, his uncomfortable relationship with his wife and brother-in-law, loyal bodyguard and somewhat weak, but dogged, clerk. These are characters I should like to follow further. Happily, there are more books to this series for me to enjoy. I certainly recommend this those who like to combine their history and mystery."
4,A New Officer of the King's Law Arrives,"Bernard Knight's THE SANCTUARY SEEKER is a well written story of when the King's coroner system came into being. History tells us this was originally another ploy of the court to extract monies for the King's treasure from the populance, but these appointed officers did a magnificent job to establish the rule of law for unexplained deaths.Sir John de Wolfe must confront his brother-in-law who holds the office of sheriff to do his job. The ex-crusader is a man of honor who answers only to King Richard I, but he is aware of the king's failings.This story of both a killing long hidden and an even older death will keep you reading. The background is perfect if a little heavy on the mud, but it is an excellent historical. I discovered this author in the bibliography of another book and he is one I will follow.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
1,Bad copy. Do not buy,Bad copy. I have lot of the original disk and this is not even close to the original disk. Do not buy.
5,Sissel - gifted Norwegian artist,"I love Sissel's equisite, clear voice. These songs beautifully sung. She has such a vocal range and depth. I would recommend Into Paradise for anyone who loves sacred music."
2,"Didn't know this was a ""teether"" toy","I bought this toy for my large full-grown dogs, not realizing it was a toy for puppies. They destroyed it in less than five minutes. The description wasn't really clear on the dog stage this toy was meant for."
3,Lasted 2 weeks...though the broken parts can be reused,"My puppy loved this. He chewed on it everything and somehow made it squeak. After the first day, one of the balls was severed from the cloth part. It was ok for a while after that, though the yellow dots were getting chewed off slowly. I find small pieces of plastic on the floor, which means that he didn't eat it (hopefully). It took a total of about 2 weeks for him to chew off a ball on each rope and pull them out. I am starting to think that my little (now) 8lb puppy is a monster. Either that or these toys just aren't meant to last. I am never buying him plastic petstages toys again, except for the blue translucent ones.I tied the rope that still has a plastic ball attached to one end to another rope and play tug with him. He still loves it."
1,Didnt last long,"Plugged a 1300 watt space heater in it. 1300 watts is indeed within rated specs for this unit.The units timer function quit working about two weeks into use. Now useless. Bought due to other ""good"" reviews. Mistake."
3,Purchased 2,I purchased 2. 1 worked and the other didn't. I bought them for my computer equipment and TV so that I could save some money each month buy them automatically shutting down at midnight and turning back on at 7am.
1,Doesn't work half of the time,"I bought this timer about 2 weeks ago, initially it worked fine for a day or two. Then afterward, it refused to turn on. I found that the buttons weren't pushing down hard enough so I pushed on them to ensure it's set. The next day I come back and it's off yet again. For kicks I turned the dial all the way around and noticed it would come on about half the time that it was set for, on/off/on/off, etc. I then again pushed the buttons, it worked fine for several days until I had to touch it. I had to unplug it to move some cords around, plugged it back in, worked fine. The next day the problem came back.Needless to say this timer is not reliable, I will never buy another Sylvania product again. I've been burned by too much of their stuff being low quality or simply failing prematurely. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
4,Excellent product with an apparent flaw,"As others have written, this is a sweet little product. The operation is very simple and it has some nice features. I bought two new and one used. Both new ones work like a charm. The used one does not work and I'm returning it. I'd add only one additional ""con"" to the other things that have been written: depending upon the positioning of your outlet it might be awkward or impossible to use the adjacent outlet. This is helped by the handy alternate socket on the timer but I also have an outlet that is positioned right above a trim board so I cannot use the alternate plug in the timer or the other socket in the wall plate. I think I'll solve problems like this by using an extension cord. Otherwise I really like it. With the free, no hassle return policy on this I have no major complaints. Looking forward to having some electricity savings."
1,Turns off when it shouldn't,"A simple mechanical timer, what could go wrong? It seemed well made, and I like the cover. But on the unit I received the sensor cog pushes the timer setting pins up and so ends up off when it should be on. I'm going to have to throw it out and buy something else."
1,Malfunctions,"This timer has little push tabs that you push down for the timer to be on - but as it goes through the cycle, those tabs get pushed up a little - or a lot. I had this connected to an air cleaner in my bedroom to be on at night but turn off during the day. This timer would work the first night, but by the second night, several of the tabs got pushed back up and so my air cleaner turned off and then back on several times, waking me up each time. The next day I reset the timer to see if I didn't have it set right - and again it worked fine the first night but on the second night, it did the off/on several times again. Reliability would seem to be a requirement for a timer, but this one is not."
2,Hmmmm,"Not sure if I got a lemon or not... I can't seem to get mine to work continuously. I'll set the timer and it will work for the night, then the next night it never turns on.I'm going to fiddle with it a little more to see if I can't get it to work properly, but it's not a very good product at the moment."
4,Works pretty well,I had an older timer that made a lot of noise. This one works well and has very little noise (unless you stand right next to it).
1,mine doesn't work either,"Like others said, those little pins don't stay down, and the item plugged in does not come on when it is supposed to. Mine doesn't come on at all. Unfortunately I bought it several months ago and only now am trying it, so I can't return it.Looked like a great design but is worthless if it doesn't work!"
5,Perfect,Took a bit too figure out since directions are vague but after a little trial and error works as described. Great buy
5,"Great price, works perfectly",I don't know why I waited so long to get one of these without the exposed plastic pieces. I have two of these and plan to buy more. They work great!
3,NOTHING SPECIAL,The first one I received did not work at all. This one ok so far and hopefully will continue to be.
1,Undependable and Not What It Says,I used this to make a dinner in my crockpot for 6 guests. It turned on when it was suppose to and I left for work. Got home 8 hrs later and crock pot was stone cold and roast was raw. So much for dinner guests! I ended up ordering from restaurant. Talk about an expensive timer!
4,"Not silent, but works","The timer works as described, but makes a little noise as the dial slowly rotates. I was going to use this timer to turn on a lamp in the morning as my alarm clock. When my room is quiet at night, the slight noise from this timer is noticeable and I found it annoying. I now use the timer in the living room where the noise goes unnoticed."
1,This Book's Title is Misleading,"Don't buy this book if you are looking for a book on how to write. You Can Make It Big Writing Books: A Top Agent Shows You How to Develop a Million Dollar Bestseller is 326 pages long. Over 220 pages are interviews with various authors. The interviews are interesting and engaging, but with a few exceptions they are not about making a book a bestseller. The interviews are about the best, worst, and most surprising things that have happened to the authors. There are some interesting interviews, and the information on promoting books is good, but there is little information on actually writing a book. If you want to read about plot, characterization, and how to write check out James Frey's books."
5,One of the best volumes ever written about selling books,"""You can make it big writing books"" is an expert combination of superb artistic advice and practical direction. The interviews have a warmly accessible, direct quality that makes the reader feel that these fine writers are talking directly to them and offering invaluable nuggets of information. There's something else that makes ""You can make it big"" special -- it's uplifting and inspiring. Without avoiding the realities all writers must know, it makes the reader feel confident that he or she can achieve their dreams of achieving a bestseller. It accomplishes this in a hugely entertaining way, and deserves to be read by all creative people. Authors Jeff Herman (one of the world's top literary agents), Deborah Levine Herman and Julia Devillers should be congratulated for their outstanding and indispensably helpful book."
2,How to Make It Big 30 Years Ago,"This book is a series of questionnaires filled out by successful authors. Many, if not most, have published 10, 20, or 30 bestsellers in the past 10, 20, or 30 years. Over and over the writers say that 30 years ago they did this or they had this bit of luck, which started their career. The Internet, self-publishing, print-on-demand, e-books, etc. are mentioned maybe once in passing, or not at all. What's repeatedly discussed is enduring reams of rejection letters from agents and publishers. I don't know any aspiring writers who worry about that. We're too busy finding ways to sell directly to readers to worry about agents and publishers. This book will give you great insights into what it took to ""make it big"" in publishing 30 years ago. Don't expect to learn much of use in the 21st century.--Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of ""Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships"""
4,Gossamer Wings - Valance,I thought the valance was adorable. I thought it was easy to put up and had no trouble with it at all. The design was beautiful and the workmanship nice. It was well worth the money.
2,Not compatible,"We purchased the Gossamer Wings Crib Set as well as an extra valance, but found that the extra valance's curtain rod hole was a different size (it's smaller).We checked other packages thinking it was just a defect for that package, but found all of the others were the same size.We had to remove the stiches and make the hole bigger to match the Gossamer Wings Valance that came in the bedding set.We do love the set, other than this defect!"
1,Valance,"Valance sure is cute, but unfortunately the hole to shirr a 2.5 inch rod through it is not large enough. I tried with two valances, so it was not as if one was slightly defective. Looks like I will have to get a pole to go through it instead. Also very challenging to iron the wrinkles out of this valance. Very expensive. I gave it one star because it was cute....and that is about it."
1,It's great if you only have one window!,It came in the crib bedding set (which I absolutely love!) I didn't even use this valance because we have two windows and the other review was correct I would have had to resew it and everything so I just went with different window coverings.
4,SAME SONGS AS ALMOST EVERY OTHER CD AVAILABLE!,"If you don't know this singer, you'd probably think she only sang 10 songs - almost all the cds listed (with different titles)are almost identical (except ""Essential"" which at least goes beyond the basic. If you like Anne Murray, Olivia Newton-John, Jane Olivor type of voice, you'd love her songs - if only they were available! If you ever find a cd with a combination of the following songs on it - BUY IT! They are the most upbeat, feel good, pick yourself up songs I have in my huge collection. They are A Bit OK, Last Blues Song, Optimism Blues, Blue, You Make It So Easy, Free and Easy, Emotion, Lovin you, Nothing Good Comes Easy, Wizard in the Wind. I have been looking for these for years but they just keep coming up with the same 10+ songs!"
4,All-Time Good Music,The vocals by Helen Reddy are just great. This CD apparently wasn't digitally remastered because the sound quality was just OK.
5,THE BEST CHILDHOOD MEMORY,"I REMEBER LISTENING TO THIS RECORD AS A CHILD, AND LET ME TELL YOU, HEARING IT AGAIN ON CD IS LIKE RE-LIVING FOND CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. MY SISTER AND I USED TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND LISTEN TO THE RECORD, SINGING AND LAUGHING ON A SINGLE MATTRESS. WE COULDN'T AFFORD MUCH BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF OUR FAMILY, AND LISTENING TO THIS RECORD MADE US FORGET OUR TROUBLES"
1,the missing pieces,"I have studied Vatican 2 to a great degree, which have included comparing translations. This translation of the Vatican 2 document I have strongly discouraged people from buying for two main reasons. The first reason is because of the inclusive language. Anyone who wants to study any work, i believe, should read it the way it was written. The Vatican 2 document were not written with inclusive language, but was written with exclusive language. By using a translation with inclusive language, there is a greater danger for misunderstanding the teachings that were presented at this Council. The second reason is because I have found pieces missing. In my studies, a friend and I were working on a paper in which he had this translation and I had the translation that is found on the Vatican website. We found several places where entire ideas of the Council Fathers were missing."
2,Three Short Novels in good condition,Faulkner's writing style is frustrating. I am not a fan of the run on sentences and omission of punctuation. I read one of the three novels and found it pretty boring and difficult to get into.
3,Faulkner,"I had never read Faulkner so this book gave me a review of his work. I was not impressed. The book did what I bought it for though and you don't know unless you try, so no regrets."
3,"""Teak""??","Okay, so you get what you pay for. The lamp works, the shade is acceptable, although cheaply made (the seam is very noticeable), and the base is ugly as a red-headed step child. Not even close to being the color of teak...sort of a muddy espresso brown.It still provides the ambient light we wanted, so we kept it but hid it behind a big plant!"
4,Like Road to Avonlea,"If u liked anne of green gables and road to avonlea, u will fall in love with this miniseries. Some of the main actors of road to avonlea have been taking out to make this movie: Zachary Bennett (Felix King), Gema Zamprogna (Felicity King), Michael Mahonen (Gus Pike)..ect.. The movie features Prussian - European 19th century living, Post American Civil War, wild Canadian prairies, American Indians, and so much more...full of adventure...Very nice, a must to see with all your familly member."
4,A good adventure tale,"I watched this movie because I'm a huge Sullivan Entertainment fan. I was mildly disappointed because I didn't think that it quite met Sullivan's high standards, but nonetheless, it was entertaining. This movie can drag at times (it's quite long!), but I could watch some parts over and over again. I think that Zachary Bennett does a wonderful job in the lead role, and Gema Zamprogna is great as his snobby sidekick.If you want to check out Sullivan at his best, watch any episode of ""Road to Avonlea"" or his great masterpiece ""Anne of Green Gables"" and the sequel. Now THAT's what I call spectacular entertainment!"
3,"Accurate, but outdated","This book must have been an excellent guide when it was first published. But we all know what three years can do to this technology - the book is simply outdated. When I ordered it, I forgot to look at the ""published"" date. The book emphasizes specific equipment and software, some of which has long lost it's leadership in this market. It needs to be updated."
2,Desperately in need of a re-write,The view from December 2000 is that this 1996 edition is now seriously outdated. This book was a handy reference when it came out in '96 but much has changed since then.It's somewhat of an embarrassment for Peachpit to continue marketing this edition.
2,Finding & Finishings: A Beadwork How-To Book,"I was felt this book is only good for a beginner. And unless you want seed bead projcts with bulky seed beed togles well you may want another book. This book clearly demonstrates things like crimp beads, so if that's what you want this may be helpful to you"
3,Findings & Finishings,"It is pretty but I will probably just put it in a pile. It is not a book I would go back to again and again. Had I had it in my hand at a store, I would have put it back."
4,Great book,"Ms Bateman has found a kniche in jewelry making that has long been absent in writing, and Ms. Bateman's photo gallary demonstrates the prolific talents of many of today's greatest artists. Although only a few finishes/clasps/ending have been illustrated in her book, she has begun to fill a prominant creative void, both in bead and metal work."
3,I'd recommend it only for beginners and sead-bead projects,"This book gives some information on tools and bead types, lists a good number of findings and how to make them and some examples of finishes with drawn-up instructions.I gave it only 3 stars because I bought other books for most of this information and expected a more detailed list of findings. The finishes and the picture gallery feature almost exclusively seed-bead projects."
3,Not the best choice for the beginner beader,"As a beginner beader, this book has not been very helpful to me. It is obvious to me that it was written for more experienced beaders who are already familiar with basic techniques and terminology. The how-to descriptions are too short and do not offer enough detail for the beginner. Although this is described as a ""beadwork how-to book"", more experienced beaders will most likely find this book helpful. I hope that I will understand the book more after gaining more beading experience."
3,Findings & Finishings: A Beadwork How to Book,"Very good book with many findings options; however, I had expected more examples of creating my own findings"
3,The book is good but not great,"The book has some good pictures of the findings. However, if you are getting this book to learn the basics of the beadwork, this book is not a good one that I would not recommend."
1,don't bother,our 8 month old beagle demolished this toy inside an hour on receiving it. 5.99 down the drain
1,Do not buy this product. Not worth the money.,"My 7 month old Maltese destroyed this toy within one hour, destroyed to the point that I immediately had to throw it away. I should have just thrown away the 7 bucks!"
5,We loved this toy!,"Our small Yorkie/Pom did eventually ruin this (the balls cracked and the ribbons were chewed off), but it took a LONG time (over a year) and was very well-loved in the meantime. She spent hours playing with this, and I would highly recommend it for a small dog."
1,Never recieved it,I wanted to get this for my daughter for Christmas went every to find it. Only to order it and weeks later being told I will get a refund. Amazon needs to screen the companies that they do businees with - this was the third bad experience when dealing with outside shops through Amazon. The problems were all the same - the companies mis-stating the product they carry. So beware of purchasing from places other than directly from Amazon warehouses.
2,Sounds Like Everyone Else,"Although I have not heard more than a few songs on this album what I've heard is great! The 1st song 'I Need to Know' has a catchy beat and good lyrics. All of the R-Angels have wonderful voices. If you like Dream, Innosense or the Spice Girls this CD is 4 u!!But here's the snag ALL THOSE BANDS SOUND THE SAME!!!!!! The song maybe good but the sound is all the same."
4,"A Movie to ""DIE"" for!","If you like a movie that is scary and suspenseful then you have found the right movie. I like The part when Grady's sister and mom go in the barn, and the werewolf tries to get in."
3,"Bad dvd quality, pretty good movie.","First off, there could be alot more dvd's to chose from! The DVD quality is choppy, and not as good as the VHs quality. There is no menu, Special features, surround sound, it needs a re-release already! All there is, is the movie! I found it in the wal-mart 5.50 bin, and I know why it's in there! I am a Goosebumps freak,(Be glad i'm not bragging that i'm the biggest fan) so I had to collect these!"
5,Well done,"This movie is one of the better goosebumps films I've seen. I like all of the goosebumps movies, but the acting and direction of this one was especially good."
5,Not bad!!,"I can't remember this episode that much because I saw it a long time ago. I actually don't even own the dvd, I just rented it from the movie store. From what I remember this one is about a family who moves into this house by the woods. When the kid goes in the woods he gets lost. I remember they never really show the werewolf that well. This is a great one. You should see it."
4,The werewolf that was terrifying,"This video tape i saw at school. In Ms.Ahern's room. It was creepy. There was this family,and this boy named Grady and this girl named Emily. They were afraid of their new town,or bored.Then,Grady meets Will,and Will tells him legends of the werewolves. And,about the town. Grady gets murdered by a werewolf,and he finds out that Will is a werewolf.He gets a fever,then he's a werewolf,too. This video was all right. I could live with it."
3,Needs more research,"As a fan of Theroux, especially his non-fiction, I was a bit disappointed with this novel. The main character, father, was psychotic and his wife was hard to understand, lacked character development as others have said. As a person who has sailed the Mosquito Coast the book could have used a good map of the area. That is a flaw common to paperbacks in general. His knowledge of freigher ships was imperfect, which was a problem for me, but probably not others who do not work on freighters. I would have given it four stars if the ending would have been more positive."
3,What About Mother?,"The huge, gaping ""hole"" in this story is the characterization (or lack thereof) of Mrs. Fox, AKA ""Mother"". She is grotesquly underdeveloped, perhaps because it would be even more unbelievable that a modern woman could be this passive.I hihgly recommend the movie version of this novel starring Harrison Ford. I don't usually think much of him as an actor, but he did a wonderful job with the character of Allie Fox (what a jerk!)"
3,Mosquito Coast,"This story started when Allie Fox's started his madness. He took his family to the jungle in Jeronimo ( a primitive island ). He lied to his family. He said that America were burnt. His family believe and went to Jeronimo. There, they started a new life. But finally their new life wasn't last too long. Their new life wasn't as good as their imagination.I like this book because this book was very unique. This story wasn't usuall, and rare. However, I was disappointed about the film, because i feel pity. His family suffered because of Allie Fox madness.I suggest this film must have a better character. And i also suggest this film more unique and it is not a funny story '_'"
3,Mosquitio Coast,"The story is about the Fox's family. allie Fox always think that America was an awful country. He hated everything about America. The people, the bilding, everything. One day he took his family to an island called Jeronimo. In there he and his family started a new life. Allie was happy in there, but not the rest of his family. His family was suffer in there. But there an explotion happened. They had to find a new place.Allie was very stuborn. He always wanted his family to do what he told. Sometime his family really hated him. But in the end when Allie was died, his family realize how much they loved allie.I like this story because the plot of the story was very unpredictable. The character were very unique and unusual. This story taught us that we have to hear everyone opinion."
2,Profoundly irritating,"Although it's the only thing that's ever inspired me to go to South America, this book annoyed me to no end. Selfish? Allie's beyond selfish. Imagine Heart of Darkness with a protagonist who insists on dragging his entire family along with him (and imagine a family cowed, blindly faithful and weak enough to go along). Insane, unsympathetic, infuriating blowhard of a character. Hated every other minute of reading this book."
2,why?,"I was wondering what his novel was about from pretty much start to finish. Paul Theroux has certainly learned from all of his travel experiences and I sense that there is some sort of strong criticism of international aid agencies, missionaries, or anybody who thinks he knows it all better than the indigenous people, in this book. Whereas his travel books are thoroughly readable, this one presents you with an annoying character right from the start and forces you to follow all his ramblings.. Though it has some interesting thoughts in it, my overwhelming impression is that I really could have spent my time reading a better book instead."
2,Not a fun read.,This book is an example of what happens when megalomania takes over a person and that person drags everyone down. I wanted this book to end even though I could tell that it was going to end badly.
3,For Kindle buyers,"I won't comment on the book itself for many have done that already but I want to give feedback to those Kindle users who may consider buying the e-book.Obviously like so many, the book was scanned to obtain its digital format. Ostensibly there was no proofreading done after that which considering the many ""typos"" and transposed characters in words is inexcusable. EX: The capital letter I is often the number 1, The ship's name alternates between Unicorn and Unicom, the list goes on. Now this wouldn't be as big a deal if the writer hadn't written the dialect of some of the characters. EX: experiment=spearmint so as you read along you are baffled by a sentence sometimes which stops you in your tracks while you try to figure out what the author really meant and sometimes you wonder of the dialect is a typo etc. All and all a good book but just wanted to warn those Kindle users who might become a bit irritated by it and would prefer to buy the hard print."
4,"Kept me reading, Shows a whole new point of view!","This book by Paul Theroux kept me reading, I can't say I was totally enthralled 100% of the time but I did learn some new things. It was smart to have the story as seen through an adolescent, The story and the events would be tainted if the reader saw the story through Allie's eyes. I realized how people in the United States tend to take everything for granted and we don't make any effort to change the setting around us, Allie Fox would consider most of us savages. I don't reccomend this book for everyone, and be patient, It starts slow."
4,Highly readable book with a Serious flaw,"Mosquito Coast is a highly readable book with a gripping plot, vivid characters and lush landscape descriptions. The serious flaw is the lack of balance between the writing style and the grim, hopeless ending. It is not only that I would never wish to see a whole, generally sympathetic and worthy, family perish in annonimity, just because of the sheer folly of the father. It is also that the tone of the narrative voice does not prepare one for such a total tragic eventuality. The dark tones in the general canvas of the book are never as dark as would be required in order to balance out the dark end and prepare us to accept it as a matter of course. It feels almost as if the writer, perhaps tiring of the story and wishing to bring it to an end, did not wish to make the effort of finding a more plausible solution."
4,The Mosquito Coast,This book is extremely well written. Its subject matter of a dysfunctional family is somewhat of a downer.
4,A true horror story,"A very believable story about the psychological power that one person can hold over others. The main character, the Father, is so unlikeable, so ridiculous, yet so compelling. People, both friends and family, follow him into dangerous situations and are persuaded to 'obey' his compulsions and obsessions, thanks to his basic competence and scientific knowledge. It is exciting - full of black humor and suspense."
5,Poignant and wonderful narrative,"This book is amazing. It is an excellent critique of American society and the lengths that some individuals will go to to get away from it. It is so inspiring on many levels. The father-son relationship is terrifying and makes me feel so fortunate to have a mentally stable father. But I feel Allie Fox is greatly maligned in many ways. He wanted what was best for his family, even if he did not approach this from the best angle. I loved this book, and I am not ashamed to say that I cried at the end."
4,mosquito coast review,"I really enjoyed the book Mosquito Coast. It was suspenseful and very detailed. As I was reading it I couldn't put it down. The character Allie really bothered me though. He was a selfish man who only thought of himself. He didn't think about how unhappy his family was going to be in a strange land. It was cruel of him to not even let them know where they were headed when they got on the ship. He also didn't think about how he was hurting the people who lived in Jeronimo. He came there thinking he was doing them a favor and expecting to be praised, yet he interupted their way of living and ruined their whole environment. In a way he was a hypocrite, for he disliked the way America was and he moved in and did the same thing to the people of Jeronimo. I enjoyed this book and it really opened my eyes to the ignorance of others."
3,"Good idea, trying to read at times","The actual plot of this story is quite interesting, the idea that an American family would up and leave the country to try and start a commune in the middle of Central America is something you can sink your teeth into. HOWEVER, and it's a pretty big however, the book at times is almost impossible to read because of the father character. I understand that he is absolutely insane, and that the writer wanted to portray the fact that he has complete dominance over his family, but honestly, you understand that entirely within the first 20 pages of the book. I felt like it was just overkill at some point. I would recommend it only if you can learn to get over the father character and take an interest primarily in the development of the sons."
3,cracks easily. Wish we could specify colors,"Bought this to complete my child's name in his train-themed room.The color was disappointing, and since he has multiple repeated letters in his name, I am stuck with some of the same color together. Wish I had an option on color.They also crack easily at the wheels. The wheel cracked in the first day or two. They're now on the wall, and are just to look at, since I'm worried about their durability if played with. Unfortunate, since my son loved to practice spelling his name with them."
3,"I saw it after the second, yet I liked this one only slightly better","As I mentioned in this review's title, I actually saw Ocean's 12 first and after finding that to be no particular thrill I was curious to see the first (not original). So I did, and all in all I can see this was definitely better than the sequel, but really not by much.You have the cast with the big names lining up a heist, which is elaborately achieved. In addition, like the second one there is some misleading of the audience about what's happened, who knows what and that sort of thing. Thankfully all of that is left to a believable level though, which is what really ruined the second film for me.However, I felt no stirring of excitement, or really interest while watching. Maybe this is because the sequel had dampened my opinions of what the first would be, or maybe this film really wasn't that special. Which is why I leave it at three, because in honesty I felt Ocean's 11, and I quote myself, really wasn't that special."
2,yet another example............,"Hollywood has managed in this film to once again showhow really great it is to be a thief.....And they managed to use, in my estimation, the top worst to do it.Clooney, who always portrays himself in no matter what role he takes...Pitt who walks thru his role like a zombie throwing in one liners to make it interesting???? And let's not forget the token female, Roberts, who I am still trying to figure out how she can be the most beautiful woman in the world, or is it one of the top five in the world? I forget......The only redeeming thing about this film was the presence of Garcia and maybe the Las Vegas location. I have no plans to see the sequel as I am sure it will be more of the same humdrumas this turkey was. To me it was just as boring as the original one only an updated version."
4,A great cast deserves a good film,"I was not really attracted of the great cast of this film (Clooney, Pitt, Garcia, Roberts... and a bunch of supporting actors). In fact, when you pick a handful of great actors, the movie becomes a overactuating one, even more if you don't have a solid and believable plot.But after watching it, I must say I was wrong. Ocean's eleven really goes well all along the film. It's easy to follow, enjoyable and actors do what they have to do. The plot is not only imaginative, but well carried on.But it reminds me ""The Sting"" (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) so much. The main couple of actors have the same role: both handsome and charming, Clooney acting as Newman (the real commandeer-in-chief) and Pitt acting as Redford (the right hand). And in both films, the bad is really, really bad!!!I should name it as a remake: it's the way you should plan a great robbery in the 21th Century, with the spirit of the 1930's."
5,"Colourful, Fun, Slick, Supurb - Great Re-make.","A rarity - a remake that's better than the original. Eleven men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Caset Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence.Yes, it's light, yes, it's a trifle but it's so fun! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint - Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful but her looks in this movie do not reach their full potential. Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy."
1,Absolutely Horrible; Unconvincing Characters,"Just because you have a bunch of ""beautiful people"" in a movie doesn't make it good. The characters are very poorly developed. Brad Pitt has no place playing a tough guy casino robber. His character is very unconvincing. And also, Julia Roberts? She's much too prudish for such a role. This plot would have been much better if the characters would have been more serious and sinister. This movie was awkwardly not funny despite its frequent efforts. Yuck."
1,"Completely, utterly disappointing!","I am shocked that anyone would take the assembled talent in this film and force them to act out such a worthless script. George Clooney mails in another ""look at how cool am I"" performance while the rest of the gangsters are as wooden as toy soldiers. And why is Julia Roberts even in this film? Andy Garcia is OK as the one dimensional villan and the technical aspects of the heist are intricate but so much more could have been done with this film. I am no film critic, but even I was wondering what was motivating these characters and there was zero chemistry. I would give it zero stars if I could, save your money and wait for a slow night to even rent it."
1,Stay Away!,"Although the cinematography is slick, the lack of character development turns this movie into nothing more than fluff. The title of the movie is Ocean's Eleven yet we are only given glimpses of Ocean's character.Even though lots of big name actors were used, there seems to be no chemistry between them to the point where a lot of the actors lines seem forced (especially noticed when Brad Pitt and George Clooney were explaining the heist).I'd avoid this one and wait until it comes out on cable"
1,A waste of time,"Ocean's Eleven, if you can get past the blinding glare of beautiful people, stylish costumes, and slick cinematography, is an extremely boring movie. The characters have no depth, or any genuine connection to one another, and the plot could be mistaken for that of a documentary. The viewer simply sees a group of guys plot and execute a robbery. Oooooh. Aaaaah. I hate using cheesy ""criticspeak"" cliches like ""eye candy,"" but I really can't think of any other way to describe this sugary, empty [movie]."
4,Slick and fun,"Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently paroled from prison, puts together a crew of A-list stars (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, etc.) in order to pull of a complicated scheme to rip off three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously and take revenge on the slimy casino owner (Andy Garcia) who married his ex-wife (Julia Roberts). This film features slick direction, mega-watt star power, a well-crafted script by Ted Griffin, and slick direction by Steven Soderbergh. The result is lots of fun to watch. There is a clever twist at the end, and the film closes with just the right note of quiet triumph."
3,Nothing special...except the cast,"There is not much to say about this movie. It definitely did not live up to the expectations created by the all-star cast and all the media hype behind it. It was not a bad movie, but there was nothing special whatsoever about the movie. It is a generic movie. If you're a drooling fan of any of the stars, or want to see the all-star cast interacting, then you'll want to see it for sure. Otherwise, take it or leave it."
1,I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.,I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.Quite simple this is a wonderful movie.Problems with Amazon streaming are still major.It makes watching the movie not worthwhile.Audio is out of sync.Artifacts and dropped frames.I have high speed broadband and no problems streaming Netflix or other programming on either my Samsung Smart TV or my computer. Yet with Amazon it is a PITA.Now works with my TV. Not willing to make all of the changes Amazon suggested to my computer.
4,Great movie!,"I'll admit, I've never seen the original, but I love this remake of it with a super blockbuster cast. This really set the bar for the series for me, and I was drawn in 100%. I'm no movie buff, but I loved this movie! The 2nd one though, well that's another story. The blu-ray features weren't any more amazing than the DVD, and wasn't anymore clearer. It was a lot sharper and crisp, but a DVD version would have been more than enough for a type of movie like this. But for the price of the blu-ray I couldn't refuse."
4,Great Movie with Audio Unworthy of BluRay,"Great heist movie in High Def. The Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 I would guess the original material was recorded in a lossless format (though likely originally in theaters as Dolby Digital) so ideally the sound would be in lossless 5.1 or 7.1 I really wish releases would include better audio- this is not relevant if you are watching on your TV's speakers, but the point of BluRay is the best video AND audio... it's a little lazy to skimp on audio."
3,"Excellent Movie, Okay Quality","I'm not a movie critic so I won't get into too much detail about liking the movie, it is all about taste. However, the quality of the blu ray left a lot to be desired, especially towards the end where there are serious color quality issues. I had the movie initially on DVD and did not have the color issues (extreme redness in the face of Bank and the diamond critic). However, the movie was only a few dollars, which is much cheaper than what the DVD costs at my local WalMart and Target."
2,boring movie!,I was very bored watching this movie. Yes the acting was good. A great cast and who doesn't love to see Brad Pitt!! But I found it dragging on and on. There were some very funny parts but I found myself waiting for the end to come. Too much hype!!
2,OCEAN'S ELEVEN,"I'm a big fan of every actor in this movie. I've seen the orginal with Frank Sinatra. I couldn't wait to see this film. When I did I was A little disapointed. It wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be. Julia Roberts who played George Clooney's ex wife didn""t have a very big part in the movie.On a scale OF ONE TO TEN. I give it a FIVE!"
3,Ocean 's Eleven,"I thought this movie was a lot like Graceland without the blood and guts. I was disappointed in how slow it ran, I realize there were alot of characters to create the basic of the movie. I own it, should have rented first this time."
5,The best sting ever!,"Steven Sobeberg really outdid himself with this movie. Not only was the script incredibly written but it brought together some of the best actors in the business. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are just a few of the great actors that appear on this film. The storyline keeps you guessing and thinking to yourself, are they really gonna get away with it? This movie is a must for every collector out there."
4,"High class actors, high class entertainment","Everything about this movie is fun. The actors are having fun playing the parts of an elite casino robbing team. Every actor gets a chance to shine and they make the most of it. Brad Pitt stole the show for me. This movie and his appearance on Friends shows that he can carry a comedy. He should choose more mainstream movies to be in. This is a quick, entertaining piece of work that requires no thought on your part except to enjoy."
4,"Good movie, but where's that ""song?"" It's missing from DVD","I just finished watching the DVD--my third viewing overall, 2nd this month (airline). Something seemed to be missing this time. Not sure at first, but it just wasn't right. Then I figured it out--there's that ""song"" you always hear associated with the movie? The medium groove with the WA-WA-WA-wa-wa-wa fading keyboards... [It's actually called Gritty Shaker]I seem to remember being played throughout the movie, now there's some slow bass line/groove at all these parts--IT WASN'T THERE LIKE THAT WHEN IT WAS IN THEATERS! Am I delirious? What happened? The movie is still good--but that song added this great sound and mood. Now it's off the DVD. What happened? Please, someone tell me what happened..."
5,OCEANS 11,OCEANS 11 WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE. IT WAS ACTION PACKED AND BRADD PITT & GEORGE CLOONEY WERE GREAT. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT CASINO ROBBERIES AND IT VERY FUNNY AND ACTION PACKED. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO IS EITHER A GEORGE CLOONEY OR BRAD PITT FAN AND WHOEVER LIKES ACTION PACKED MOVIES.
2,too artificial,"Well Cloneey face is really fashioning, and I love to see Elliot Gould on screen, but Julia Robert is a skeleton. And the film is impossible story and Mr Sodelbergh must do something better than remakes."
4,Not a waste of your time !,"Although Ocean's Eleven is yet another remake of an oldie (what happened to those original scripts?) it is a very engaging and highly watchable film. Too few actors are willing to share the spotlight with their fellow actors, yet many of the best movies of all time are ensemble casts. This is one one those films, albeit not on par with say ""The Great Escape"" or ""Pulp Fiction"". This ""Ocean's Eleven"", as with the orginal, is just plain fun to watch. The interaction between the cast members is sometimes electric (or at least rug static) and the story is not so implausable (stunts too!) as to be a distraction. It's just nice to see 'million dollar' actors having fun on screen, together, and no one walking off the set 'cause they weren't the biggest, er...star. Worth the time to watch."
2,Very boring and stupid,"Just one but great thing about this film: THE CAST.BITT, DAMON, CLOONEY, ROBERTS, GARCIA, AFFLECK(Casey).All this, great actors.But the movie was so stupid and predictable I just wanted to get out of the theater."
3,Ocean's 11,"Ocean's 11- The remake of the rat pack movie.Well, here are some of the positive comments on the film:1. This movie has an incredible cast: Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts2. It's directed by Steven Soderbergh, last year's Oscar winner for Best director (Traffic and Erin Brockovich)3. It's a remake but the story is completely different this time. And the tools are advanced and it's more modern4. It's a stylish heist movie.Now the negatives:1. It's a heist movie located in Las Vegas. How many films have we already seen that involoved stealing in Las Vegas.2. The story is too shallow: Knock off three banks on the day of a boxing match.3. There is nothing revolutionary about the film. Nothing you haven't seen before.So over all, this is a film to relax and enjoy. It won't be a masterpiece or a classic. It will be remembered as an ordinary heist movie with extraordinary stars."
4,"Okay, now I gotta see Ocean's Twelve","Yeah, it's impossible, it's ridiculous, it's contrived, but you gotta love the acting and the chemistry between the actors. Only Julia Roberts' role was maybe a mismatch, and that's difficult for me to say as she's one of my favorites.The 1960's original version with Frank Sinatra and the infamous Rat Pack was fun, too, but this contemporary one makes full use of all the modern cinema techniques that make action/adventure films such fun to watch.The whole setup (a plan to rob several Las Vegan casinos owned by a guy who has `taken possession' of Danny Ocean's ex-wife) is convoluted and sometimes difficult to follow - and frankly, rather than hit replay and try to figure it all out, I'd just advise suspending disbelief and going with the flow.It's a hoot."
4,Clever robbery,"Oceans Eleven is a clever robbery with an outstanding cast. Sometimes when movies become so twisted that the end isn't worth it, the movie starts to become irratating. You should be able to see what I mean when you start to see the predictablity and high cost these robbers go through to achieve their goal."
4,"""If You Lose Focus for One Minute...""","...then you'll definitely miss something in this movie!! This is a movie that you must watch from beginning to end to really understand what all has happened, and it even took me two times to really get it. Ocean's Eleven is about a group of con men trying to rob the Bellagio, MGM Grand, and the Mirage in Vegas, which is pretty much impossible. I love this movie for a few reasons:1. Great cast!! So many big names in this movie and they all do a fantastic job!2. I found this movie very unpredictable. Just when you think they are going to get caught in the middle of their heist - they surprise you!3. Although this movie is mainly a suspense/drama type movie, it does have some really funny moments.I would highly recommend this movie to anybody! It's an all-around good movie."
3,best version of Ocean's 11 to own so far...,"Viewed on a 1080p Panasonic viera 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP-BD10 through a Yamaha RX-V659 receiver (5.1 speakers.PQ - not a lot of 3D pop, but details, flesh tones, and colors are very good.HD audio is OK.a couple levels up from the DVD, it's worth owning!"
1,Send the EPA to investigate this Ocean - it stinks!,"What a waste! Good actors reciting brain-numbing lines; acting that was flat, uninvolved, and uninspiring. So many good actors given such dreadful lines. Was this movie filmed in parts, based on the actors' availability and schedules? I got the impression that the actors in this movie were not connected to one another when this movie was made. I rented this and the most fun I had was sending it back down the return chute at the video rental store. Ocean's Eleven is a zero."
2,Julia Roberts What Were You Thinking???????,"Two issues here ..... as a major Julia Roberts fan, it is a shame to see her sell-out. How could she let herself be talked into a 'walk-on' role, surrounded by that much testosterone. She looked lovely, and that was all... a strong non-verbal statement about the value of women everywhere. We count on her for better than that. Then, if the talk shows are true, she demanded the standard $20 million for the ""work"". Bad call.The story is an interesting one and could have been fast moving and entertaining with all that star power. But there was no focus, other than the stars, even the soundtrack was a cop-out.How insulting to viewers who actually thought we would be getting something for our movie ticket. I suppose it proves that I am not much of a viewer. They were right....one can make a lousy movie and if the superficial elements look right, we will go and pay to see the movie."
3,Big Names That's All..,"I found this DVD boring and really nothing and very little action, just big names going through the motions, I wouldn't say anyone did a good job at acting, they were just there, Julia Roberts had a very small part, in fact they all fell short at making this movie interesting.. Boring.."
1,Slick but Shallow,"This is what passes as entertainment today....Boring....so shallow they couldn't even drown in it....And I want to know who crowned Ms. Roberts....beautiful? Maybe,in another life...but honestly, she looks like she's been hit in the face with a frying pan!.....Save your time and money!"
2,Ocean's Eleven,"What a disappointment! I fought to stay awake this was so boring. The only redeeming qualities were good looks and some witty dialogue. Otherwise, the plot plodded along, the techiques for robbery were predictable and the actors were hugely under-utilized. Don't waste your money; save this one for library check-out!I'm going back to the original rat-pack. At least there was some style of new, hip sophistication underneath it all."
3,1 out of 3 ain't bad,"I loved Ocean's 11, why did they have to ruin it with the other two? was it money? i sure hope not, because in my humble opinion they spent more money making the other two that it wasn't worth it."
4,Great Movie,"I know all the stars Like George Cloony (Batman) Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman, Steel Magnolias) Matt Damon (All the Pretty Horses) and Brad pit (the Mexican, Behind enemy lines). They are all good actors and they are very funny. It's a fun movie and I recommend you to see it. George cloony is Hilarious He plays so good in this movie. He is perfect for his role. I think you should absolutely see it. I hope I helped you."
1,I FELL ASLEEP,"I can't honeslty review this movie, because I fell asleep about 20 minutes into it. I'm a movie freak, really into popular movies, and I never fall asleep in the theatre. However this time I did.I just thought the movie was boring. There was nothing to stay awake for."
1,can't compete,"I have seen several remakes of older films done & in my book you can never make a remake as good as the orignal. Why don't film makers realize ""You Can not replace old movies, no matter who stars in it""!."
3,Not the Real Ocean's Eleven,"The dialogue has been altered, perhaps to make the product more ""pg-13."" Not cool. I'll buy the disc. My experience was not as good as I had hoped."
2,"Action, less plot","This movie is definitely filled with action from start to finish. However, it's a little skimpy on the plot. Entertaining, but not a memorable movie."
2,Poor Viewing Quality,"Ocean's Eleven arrived on time, in good condition, and with no problems concerning the shipping and handling.I may have been mislead as to the description of the product. I bought this movie 'used' and its condition was prescribed as 'good.' I figured that since it was labeled as 'good' then the viewing quality would be good. However, there were multiple scenes that would not play due to the extremely scratched nature of the disc. At least three of the scenes in the movie were impossible to watch and when reached during the flow of the film, the screen would pause. I could not change scenes or fast forward from this point. The movie stopped completely and ceased to run.I still made it through the movie by reaching these scratched scenes, stopping completely, then skipping that scene and choosing a previous one in the scene selection part of the main menu. It was frustrating to watch. I will try to improve the disc by waxing it. We'll see what happens."
5,Awesome gift idea.,"Purchased this as a gift for my movie-loving uncle, and he was really excited to receive it. I think he was more interested in the recent versions of the movie, but for the price, you can't beat it."
2,Predictable Action Flick,"A glittery heist flick that wants desperately to be old-fashioned. It rounds up huge movie stars to fill predictable types, and it has a lot of gloss but not nearly enough camp. Soderbergh busies himself with a lot of retro-style film tricks left untouched sich 1972--wipes and split-screens--and there is a lot of 60's lounge music, but they aren't enough to save the film from staying one big, empty, slick, somewhat entertaining set piece. George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt manage to be more irritating together than separately. Julia Roberts has some witty, rapid-fire Hepburn-and-Tracy style banter with Clooney; as the villain, Andy Garcia is exceptionally well-combed. Despite or perhaps because of its cliches and far-fetchedness, its implausibly narrow escapes and fairy-tale plot devices, the film is almost self-indulgently enjoyable. Thankfully, it is so rapidly paced that its two hours pass by in the blink of an eye."
2,Fun rubbish,"This film does not bear too much talking or thinking about. It is a predictable and extremely far-fetched film, but still manages to be entertaining. Analyze the plot and it is clearly absurd. But that is not the point of this male oriented kind of film. The actors are ""cool"" as is the ""late-night"" soundtrack and everyone can say smooth, sassy, lines in improbable situations and spend ridiculous amounts of money and drink lots of cool-looking hard liquor in crystal glasses. Did I say the film was cool? The only difference between this kind of film and many others is that they get away with it - that is because in Hollywood rules they steal from a ""bad"" man who has stolen Ocean's girl (the swine!) so it is okay.It is a fun load of nonsense. It was nice to see Elliot Gould reappear (where has he been?) and also Carl Reiner was nice to watch. The best absurdity was the EMF pulse generator - a nuclear device without the destructive power. Hmm."
2,Not what I expected,"I frankly can't understand the great buzz about this movie, the reason I went to see it. Besides some nice beefcake and male bonding humor, it was pretty average. None of those guys had a sympathtic enough personality to make me care about his problems, and Julia Roberts seemed like a token."
4,Beginning to a great collection,The beginning of Ocean's crew.Brad Pitt & George Clooney are great together.
3,Fun Vegas crime caper,"It's got charm, some good lines, a few good setpieces and gets away with its flaws. Good entertainment.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,What kind of movie was this?,"What is it, a romance, comedy, drama, or action. Luxemburgh ratings belives its a little bit of everything. Ocean's eleven is about a bunch of people planning to rob a casino in Las Vegas. the acting was what gave this movie three of it's stars and the comedy gave it one star. It's fairly a movie for anyone who likes a little bit of everything. I had only been to Las Vegas once and I think this movie displayed Las Vgas to what its supposed to be. GAMBLING CITY!!!! Luxemurgh ratings gladly presents Oean's eleven with 4 complete stars!"
4,Ocean's Eleven,"I rate this 4 stars. The story is pretty good, amusing, smart, & detailed. The cast is excellent, hats off to Brad Pitt & George Clooney, Don Cheadle, so many others.....though, I was expecting a bigger role from Julia Roberts, something to really make her talent shine through. Over all, this is very good. A criminal gets out of jail ( George Clooney) & is seeking to rob three casinos,...all owned by the same man...the man who is now with the girlfriend who left HIM.Sound typical & ordinary? No. Which is what makes this movie simply fantastic!"
5,Entertaining,"I have not seen the orginal version of this movie, but can imagine that it was not good or there would have not been a need for this remake. The only problem with this movie is George Clooney. He lacks the depth that all great actors must have. It has taken some time, but Brad Pitt is finally coming around as a good Actor and someone I now enjoy seeing on film. Acting aside, this is a good movie. I am really glad that more and more movies are being made where the BAD guys get away. We have seen strides like this before with love stories....Girl Meets boy, Boy and Girl fall in love, Boy or Girl Dies. I can't think of too many people who would watch [movies] like that. But when someone robs three casinos and makes out with the money and the girl and they do it with Class, how could anyone not like that. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good way to spend two hours in front of the TV."
2,Surprisingly BORING!,"Despite the star-studded cast this remake drags, big time. I went to see this in the theater and desperately want the [money back] I wasted on this movie back. I didn't think the plot made a whole lot of sense either. So I strongly suggest you skip adding this flop to your video collection."
3,"Good film, but not faithful to original","The film itself was pretty good. I really like the plots that are intricate and have plans that are very complicated. But, for this particular film, they should have ditched the girl and just stuck to the story. The story and plan were complicated enough that they didn't need to waste 30 minutes with Julia. More time should have been spent explaining their plan.As far a fathfulness to the original. Vaguely. Still a good movie though. Pitt and Clooney were great. They should do more work together.I am going to get the original Sinatra film and watch it again. That is a true masterpiece."
1,Overrated Junk!,"This is one of the worst films I have seen in recent years. It is very shallow, even by Hollywood blockbuster standards. The ""plot"" is unrealistic ... (are there really any criminals who are this nice?). Some say this is one of the greatest casts ever assembled. I don't agree with that. Roberts, Clooney, Damon etc are big stars, yes, but that does not mean they are good actors. Ocean's Elleven has been compared to Out of Sight, but that is really unfair since the latter is a much better film than this .... What went wrong Soderbergh?"
1,sinks to the bottom of the ocean,"What a steaming pile of horse manure. This film should never have been made the first time, let alone twice. The original was just a vehicle for the rat pack anyway. Why did this film get made? Better still, how did it get made? Well, if the big names commit to it, some schmucks will pour money into anything. Was is supposed to be a comedy/something or other, 'cause it was about as funny as peeling back your own finger nails. And how did they manage to make julia look so old? Save your time and save your dollars."
2,BORING!,"Ocean's Eleven is hard to enjoy, but not all the time. At some times, its funny, although most of the movie is boring. Julia Roberts is hot in this movie, yet the actors give bad performances in this movie."
4,Cool Movie,"Seeing as I'm seeing this movie years after it had been released, I kinda new what to expect. Even still, it was a fun movie. I recommend it."
3,Brad Pitt's Amazing Hairstyle!,"Gasp in awe as Brad Pitt meets George Clooney for the first time in a bleached-blonde, deliberately messed-up, gelled-up hairdo! Watch in amazement as it suddenly becomes neat and tidy as they leave the club! Then revel in the glory of the hairgel suddenly disappearing as they hatch their plans in a restaurant! They leave and go look at some blueprints? Bam! Hairgel miraculously reappears! All this in one evening... Amazing!For a Vegas movie, it was ok, but seemed like a parade of giant egos. Everyone was just ""too cool"", you know? After a while, I started to get more enjoyment out of watching the Siegfried and Roy act happening with Brad's hair."
4,I ilked it,"I liked this movie. I have never seen the original so I am not here to compare and contrast differences only to say that it was an enteraining movie.The plot was a good one. The intrcacys of the script were well thought out and made sense, with lots of twists and surprises. What added to the movies entertainment value was the fact that along with all of the above it was funny and well acted. The movie never drags but one thing the viewer should be aware of is while it may seem the movie has slowed down and perhaps you can read the latest People magazine while listening, the details that take place can sometimes be important. So PAY ATTENTION this movie really doesn't drag the details are where you least expect them to be :)I recommend this movie as a keeper. I bought it on DVD and have watched numerous times (as oppsed to those movies you buy and only watch once which are actually a big waste of money)."
4,Sweet 2 hours,"Great cast. Good flick. Fun plot with some twists. Ending was lacking, but the movie is really worth it. See for yourself."
4,Ocean's Eleven - a good reuse of the title,"Ok, George Clooney as Sinatra's Danny Ocean is a bit of a stretch but that really is only the similarity. While the original is full of legends from the past, this remake contains our generations future legends - Julia Roberts, Clooney, Pitts /etc are probably destined for that same mantra. On the whole of the movie, it was excellent. Not to be compared to the original by purists....4 Bellagio fountains as a rating out of 5"
2,Ocean's Eleven,"This movie was so BORING!!! There was no story to it. Okay, it was about a heist of a casino in Las Vegas. And the first half of the movie was extremely draggy, being all about the planning stage. For a movie with so many big name actors, it was a complete disappointment. Whoever wrote the story needs to go back to story school. The lack of plot wasted a lot of good talent by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon & Julia Roberts."
3,Characters trying too hard to be cool,"The plot was stupid and the characters were trying too cool. Typical Hollywood ego getting in the way of making a good film with a good story line. No depth of character. It's not a horrible movie, just not much of a story."
3,Great cast - bad excecution,"Having seen the original Oceans Eleven with the 'Rat Pack' I was expecting something fantastic; especially considering the cast list, George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. The movie starts off with some promise but looses its way. By the middle of the film your waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen.If your feeling tired and are finding it hard to fall asleep - throw this DVD into your player, this will do the trick!"
4,Cool movie!,"I'm not gonna say that this movie was the best ever but it's really entertaining. And the cast was beautiful! It wasn't exactly what I expected but I don't regret seing it, infact I don't regret it at all! They did a good job in this movie. (oh and Brad Pitt was HOT!!!!!)"
1,Where was the talent?,"There is a reason why the original version is called a ""classic."" Classics SHOULD not be tampered with and someone in Hollywood told the cast of the terrible remake that they could act. Don't waste your time or money! The acting is the worst i've ever seen. You can see why these so-called actors will never make it on the stage. I'm sorry to say that there is not one redeaming factor about this film,,,,sorry,,,i take that back. You could use the DVD as a coaster for your coffee cup."
3,julia roberts singlehandedly turned it into a chick flick!,"even though she is the only woman in the cast and has a minor supporting role, that she gets mad and leaves the owner of the 3 casinos and why, is rediculous! That the owner doesnt just have clooney killed for robbing the casino even though he is supposed to kill anyone that crosses him and their famillies etc, is silly! other than that the plot with the specialist crooks is interesting."
4,"Still remember it because of the look, style and story","This film has a special feel, look and style perhaps due to Steven's direction, its beautiful cast and performances. The plot is not easily forgotten."
1,Why does everyone like this?,"This film was neither interesting nor entertaining. It was just boring. The scenes were not exciting, the jokes weren't funny. Julia Roberts, who is talked about in the film like she is the most beautiful woman alive, seemed fairly ugly in this movie to me. The characters were hollow and uninteresting. Some have said that they liked seeing how it all came together at the end, and I did too, but not nearly enough to make me like this awful awful movie. I went to see this movie expecting to see a movie that wasn't good but was entertaining and fun to watch. It was not. I repeat, it was not.-One last note: The coloring irritated me. There were no particular colors or changes in coloration throughout, nothing done with the color that was consistent at all. After Soderbergh films like Traffic and Erin Brockovich this was something I was looking for. The only element of consistency I saw was that in every scene, the colors present were intensified. The contrast increased..."
1,Ocean's Eleven,This movie is was so slow going I almost turned it off a couple of times.If you have the time don't waste it on this movie.Julia Roberts has a very small roll in this movie.She apears in the movie after an 1hr.
4,It Kept Me Occupied,"Others here have done a great job with the plot, so I'm just going to give my overall opinion. I liked it. It's not an intellectual film, nor is it a film with tremendous character development or a powerful plot. It's just a simple diversion, and it succeeds magnificently. Don't watch this if your idea of entertainment is something from Cannes or Sundance; to use an analogy, this is more akin to one of those novels by the checkout lane in the grocery store than to something by Milan Kundera.The only downside to the entire film is having to see Elliot Gould's bare hairy chest. Whoa!"
4,Great movie,"This is a great movie. It keeps you guessing and has a great twist to it. I would really recommend it to anyone. The DVD is good, but not great. I would like to have seen some deleted scenes and/or bloopers. I know that there were some from viewing other special features. A definite have-to-buy though."
5,Pure Entertainment!,"I absolutely loved this movie. It got right to the point, straight from the beginning and kept the viewer involved all the way into the end. The supporting actors were just as great as the big-name stars. Bottom-line:Ocean's Eleven includes stellar performances, a great story line, and a truly fun movie to watch."
5,Awesome movie!!,"At first, I didn't even want to see it. But after the first few minutes, I was hooked. Very clever story line!"
4,I wanted to give this film 5 stars,"Oh how I wanted to give this film five stars. It had me entertained from beginning to end. It has everything a great movie should have: great acting performances, superb dialog, masterful directing, good screenplay with a strong plot, and it's downright entertaining (the most important part). Unfortunately the ending detracted from rest of the movie. Perhaps it's more accurate to call it an epilogue. The movie really ends at the point where the characters are standing outside the hotel. The five minute scene that follows seems pointless and forced. I don't want to detail what happens but it feels like one of those scenes that are added after test audiences disagree with the original ending.Still this is definately one of the best films of 2001 hands down. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could."
5,S-T-Y-L-E,"Thats all this film is. STYLE. It is amazing to me that this film has all of these fine actors, and none of them tried to steal the show, like I thought they were going to do. I love the plot of the film, I LOVE the scene after they were done with the Job, all of the theives are standing watching the water fountains, each one walking away one at a time. The music is classic, and really adds to the value of the film. By FAR, one of the best films I have ever seen."
2,The Worst Remake EVER!!!!,"This film has a bad story, a big budget cast that cant act, and a good director. I was very excited to see this remake of this 1960 classic RAT PACK caper,because I loved the first one and after seeing this I went home and watched the original but all a side let's get back to this remake. The first 45 minutes of this film were good, but by the time they got to the heist I wanted to leave the teather, one thing I loved about the movie was the sharp classy dressing by Brad Pitt, George Cloony, and Carl Reiner, It was good to see Elliott Gloud and Carl Reiner back on the big screen after all these years that's one thing Hollywood should do more often because there part of the reason I gave this movie two stars, but i think the biggest problem was just these two things (too many actors with no room to act) and (not enough chemistry between the actors) if this movie would have had that much i think it would have been as good as the first one ..."
1,no,I tried to watch this movie but after the first seconds of hearing Clooney's voice I got sleepy. My eyes blurred at the screen and everything got dark siewpfieys...oops sorry I am having a flashback to the moment and forgot how to type. I didn't see this movie and don't know if I ever will. So don't bother with my opinion. It is just one out of many.
2,This becomes more and MORE unbelievable as it goes,"Flashy but typical remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra film about ex-con Clooney, who is just out of prison and already planning yet another heist. This time on three hot-shot Vegas casinos, worth one-hundred and fifty million smackers. He also plans to win back his ex-wife (Roberts) from cut-throat casino executive (Garcia). Not only do they expect us to believe that Clooney is the good guy but also that Julia Roberts is actually worth over $150,000,000. To make things worse, the ending looks as if it was rejected from an episode of DAYS OF OUR LIVES. How can anyone care for such unlikeable characters?"
3,I don't really like it...and quite frankly I don't understand why!,"With a cast this great and a director this good you'd expect this movie to be much better than it really is. `Oceans Eleven' isn't horrible, it isn't even bad, it's okay, but okay is not what I wanted. When I first saw this film I was blinded by the star power and ended up purchasing the DVD, but upon watching it again, shortly after buying it, I realized something. I don't really like this movie. It bores me a bit and doesn't leave a lasting impression. In fact, I have no desire to see `Oceans Twelve' or the upcoming `Oceans Thirteen' although I will most likely end up seeing them some day. The plot could have served up a great movie, but so many areas of this film run dry. It's hard to explain really because nothing seems to be wrong with it. Great cast, decent script, good plot...it should be wonderful but something...I can't place it...but something is horribly wrong!"
4,Good once you realize this is aslick but not deep movie,"While the cast consists of some very good actors & actress (Julia Robets, George cloony, Brad Pitt, etc.) this isn't a very deep, motivational film.It's more about style - Vegas how we'd all like it to look & be: bright lights & loads of money, no losers (except for those greedy casino owners who deserve being hit every once in a while).The extras (including some documentaries & 2 commentary tracks) were good."
1,Boring. 15th april 2004.,"I must of watched only 20 minutes of it, it was so boring. More of an adult film. I was dying to see it for ages then my dad had it for christmas. Really you can tell by reading the back of the box and looking at the box what it is about. More reccomended for older people."
4,"""Well put together""","Ocean's eleven is a well put together movie. It was well directed and acted out. There is also a good story line. I think the best part of the movie was the ending. It made you think, and what happens is totally unexpected. There are a few drawbacks however. The story is very unlikely to happen. There are also some parts that move slowly. This movie is for the thinker, not for one who craves action. Buit I would still highly recomend this movie."
3,"Entertaining, but in the usual obvious modern style","Ocean's Eleven is one of the better movies released recently, but it is not to be compared with the original. It lacks the style and the subtlety that makes the original and many of the movies of that era magic....three stars (the original gets 5)"
3,Good idea,"Leading men of the moment, a top female actor together for a glitzy, swell heist in sin city. Smooth dialogue from bad guys ya love and the good guy who is really bad gets it in the end. Good but not great. Everyone's in on the joke and that's what makes it easier to watch the second time.People rob casinos for the same reason they rob banks, that's where the money is. The same holds true for big name actors working together, that's where the money is, but unfortunately not where the best movies are made."
2,Stylish Boredom,"This film is really not what I though it would be. The trailer was great, but upon watching the film, I had very brief laughs, very little excitement, and very much boredom. This has an awesome cast (as follows): George Clooney, Bernie Mac, Brad Pitt, Elliott Gould, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother), Scott Caan (James' son), Carl Reiner, Lennox Lewis, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, and Steven Soderbergh directing, so clearly there was a good film to be made, but this just isn't it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback."
4,Better after the 2nd,One point I would make about this movie is that it seemed to make more sense and enjoyable after seeing 'Ocean's Twelve'. I think this is because a person can see patterns or themes develop such as the connection of winning back the heart of a lost love. This movie is enjoyable and pretty lite.
3,Ocean's Eleven,"Great movie. I bought this movie thinking that it had Italian a language to choose from, but it did not. Keep in mind that this is a Region 2 PAL movie. Make sure you have a multi-region dvd player that converts PAL movies to work on NTSC TVs if you plan to watch this movie in the USA."
3,A whole lotta somethin' goin' on...,"...but you'll be hard pressed to figure out what it is. I found this movie to be OK, but rather hard to follow. I enjoyed the ending, when they actually pulled off the heist, but for the most part I found it slow and uninteresting. The actors were good, but there was no development of the characters...I had no idea how or why these guys knew each other or wanted to do this job together. Plus...the heist seemed a bit too easy...nothing went wrong, for goodness sake! Overall, it's an enjoyable break for a couple hours, but it's certainly no classic."
5,Great Fun Movie,"Ocean's Eleven is funny, fast paced, clever and bound to entertain. Ocean's group of extremely funny and likable characters use a card like stratagy of bluff and double bluff to catch you out at ever corner as they plan to rob the richest casino in Las Vegas. With an all-star cast that certainly doesn't let you down Ocean's Eleven is unmissable."
4,Expect the unexpected,"When I sat down to watch this film, I wasn't sure what to expect, since it was touted as a remake - though I'm not sure how much this film and the original have in common other than the title character and the casino heist. This movie is packed full of twists and turns. The characters were very well-played - despite the long list of big-name stars (George Clooney, Julie Roberts, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, etc.), most of whom appear in small, supportive roles without which the story couldn't have been told successfully. Around every turn is another ""gotcha"" - intertwined with humor and high-tech gadetry. After watching this film, my first thought was ""I HAVE to see the original."" It'll keep you guessing right up to the end."
5,Just flat out fun to watch,"Ocean's Eleven is just an all around fun movie to watch... the flow and ""attitude"" behind the movie just gets my energy flowing every time I watch this classic remake. The cast was well put together and everyone plays their part well to make quite the team. This is some of entertainment at it's best, something that is so easy going where you can lose yourself in the entertainment of it all.This is a great addition to my already large collection of DVD's that I own, and if you have not seen this yet I highly recommend it."
4,"Very good, great sexy, stylish, modern cast and cool theme.","I really liked this movie. It was done stylish, but not over the top. George Clooney was really good in this. I loved how it ended :) and wish they would've left it at that. cuz '...twelve' was a snoozer."
4,"NOT Ocean's 11, but good anyway","I wish they wouldn't try to improve on definitive versions of movies! I also wish they wouldn't remake a movie and reatin the title!I feel sad that this will replace what people think of when hear the title ""Ocean's 11"" as the old Rat Pack one was the best!Having said that this movie is a good film in its own right. It is so different to warrent being called something else. It was very entertaining, although I was a bit diappointed with the ease with which the money was obtained. I felt that the vault would have had many more problems that needed resolving.The DVD commentary by the stars is hopeless! It was nothing more than ""Oh this is where I did this and he did that. He was great doing that. We had a great time didn't we"". It was quite obvious they had nothing of real value to say. Come on guys! You were great at the (easy) acting, but leave the commentary to the director!"
3,Casino Revenge,"Clooney and Pitt do a good job of entertainment in this flic; however, the story is based on Clooney's revenge against his girlfriend's new beau- an egotistical casino owner. Clooney forms a team to rob an impenetrable casino. The interrelationships are interesting as well as the theoritical security of the casino.But--- the end leaves you out in the cold; and except for him getting back his girl- you are left in the air 10 feet off the ground waiting for gravity to eventually work.The robber overcomes the bad casino owner.Boring.ralphmax@i-55.com"
2,Here's a brilliant idea...!,"This movie actually feels as though Clooney and Soderbergh had started with the premise -- Here's a brilliant idea! Let's do a movie about a guy who gets a bunch of specialists together to do a big heist! It's never been done before!Why didn't they have Sammy doing ""E-O Eleven"" on the soundtrack?"
4,NOT A CLASSIC BUT ENJOYABLE!,well worth seeing - but where do these women's hair styles come from - yuck!will probably watch again in a year or two ----Recommended for space in time.
4,"Oceans Eleven, then and now.","A really nice collection of Ocean's films which are best viewed begining with the original Ocean's 11 before moving onto the newer Clooney and Pitt versions.The earliest rat pack type flick is certainly showing its age, but still decidedly worth watching.Of the newer versions my personal preference is for Oceans' 11, which I find has a clear storyline and excellent all round acting with a well executed finale.Overall I'd rate them as follows, keeping in mind the year they were made.Ocean's 11 - 1960, ****Ocean's 11 - 2001, *****Ocean's 12 ****Ocean's 13 ****All the modern movies have excellent acting, good storylines, though I thought the storyline on 13 was of lower quality.The special effects and film quality were excellent for the most part, among Hollywood's best for the relevant years.If you enjoy films of this type you will not be dissappointed with this multipack. At the price point I'd have to give it 5 stars for value."
4,four-in-one,"The package is standard for several movies in one case. There are two dvds; one side is one movie, the other side is the other. If you want all of them at a good price, this is the set for you.The old version of ocean's eleven is quite different, worth watching once, although in my opinion the newer one is better."
4,The Movies and Nothing Else,"I really was surprised to see that inside the box was literally just two double-sided DVDs. I guess for the price, you can't get much more, but it felt just about as cheap as it was. One one side in the center of the disc is the ribbon telling you which side is which movie. (Note: if you're giving this as a gift to somebody less tech-savvy, explain the double-sided premise. My mom thought all DVDs and CDs were single-sided)Nothing spectacular for sure, but for the price you can't beat it. I was going to buy them in other configurations as a trilogy, but for cheaper and including the original was tough to pass up."
4,Good entertainment,Daniel Ocean(Clooney) is a thief which has been released from prision on parole and plans to rob 3 of the best casinos in Las Vegas owned by his ex-wife boyfriend.So he teams with 11 specialists to take the $150 millions that have the casino vault.With great effects and having helped with Ocean's men they finally get the money first conning Terry Benedict.After expending 6 months back in prision Danny goes with Tess after her lost interest in Terry.Good plot.
2,Annoying,"I would have enjoyed this much more had it been a big spoof on privileged parents which for some reason I thought it might be. Not. Lydia et al seemed waaay too over-involved in their kids' lives. And way too serious about it. Are you kidding?? I LOVE and am honored and relieved to be the one to bring paper products to school functions. The other thing that seemed a bit off was the middle schoolers I know and love really don't want their parents hovering and micro managing all school events. Volunteering and being involved in one's kids' lives is excellent but at times I wanted to shout at Lydia, ""Whose needs are you meeting?!? Yours or your childrens?!?"" I did really like Erin...she seemed like a nice girl. And I agree with some other readers that the bit about Chris in the 2nd half didn't flow with the earlier part of the book."
2,Bait and switch,"From the synopsis I read to the title itself, I realized not too far into this novel that this was a bait-and-switch. It looked like this was going to be a novel about how a mom deals with her daughter's popularity, but it was not. Oh, it starts out that way, but this reader soon realized that it was not really about her daughter at all, but the minutae of the mothers' catty relationships with each other. Three-quarters into it the author throws in a scandal for good measure.The women in this novel made me queasy, and reaffirmed the fact that I am glad that I am not a part of the 'in' group.And by the way Ms. Seidel, twelve-year-olds are not ""teenagers,"" as they are constantly referred to in this book. Pre-teens, at the most, but not teenagers."
3,"Was happier with his performances on ""Woman on Top"" Soundtrack","He is very talented but the music on this CD was not (to me) as good as the music on the sountrack ""Woman on Top"" in which he was FANTASTIC! He has a great voice but the material was not that entertaining. I have not played it since I listened to it the first time. I have however listened to him on the soundtrack ""Woman on Top"" many times and enjoyed his performances on the various tracks he performed very much."
2,Researchers reader,"This book is great to see research into this subject, and a great example of how to write a book on you rresearch, but it's not an easy read, and difficult to understand, if you don't do research."
5,Behind the Paint,"Behind the paint is an auto-biography about Detroit rapper, Violent J. Behind the paint is mainly about Joe Bruce (Violent J) and his brother Rob Bruce (Jumpsteady) but features the entire Psychopathic family, as of 2003. Behind the paint is everything from the troubled childhood to the endless days at Kinko's. Behind the paint is more than a huge book, it is a book about the true beginnings of Insane Clown Posse and Psychopathic records, and even more the rise of the hatchet. Behind the paint is strongly recommend for all Juggalos. Behind the Paint is the thoughts of Violent J word for word, and is the real what happened not just some made up stories. Another reason I love this book is after reading it I have so much more respect for all things Psychopathic. I hope you read Behind the Paint. Whoop! Whoop!"
3,May need to read again...,"I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but to be honest I was a bit confused when I finished. I may need to re-read to make sure there wasn't something I missed."
2,Definitely not tasteless,"Just received this product yesterday. I had high hopes that I'd be able to mix it in with things like coffee, tea, yogurt, etc. Don't even think about mixing it with tea. It makes it kind of thick & it tastes bad. Tried it this morning with yogurt. It was better than with the tea, but it's not tasteless. I realize it says virtually tasteless on the container but it really does have a taste. It's sort of vanilla like but not really. It's hard to describe. It has a weird aftertaste too. It doesn't mix in as easily as I would like either. It leaves lumps. I seriously doubt I'll be able to finish the entire container. Too bad I just wasted $30+. Will not be purchasing this ever again."
3,So-so product,This stuff is certainly NOT tasteless. It can even cause the gag reflex if a significant amount is added to any one food. Seems to dissolve well. Maybe not the best option for protein supplement.
4,Helps me get the protein I need.,"I had bariatric surgery 4 months ago,and I believe this product has helped me have positive results. I try to get 60-80 grams of protein a day and this whey powder can be mixed with a variety of foods and beverages. I usually start my day with a home made warm chai tea drink using chai tea bags, milk or soy milk and 2 scoops of this powder. This whey powder is unflavored, but I would say it has a mild taste that is easily masked by whatever you mix it in. It does not affect the texture or thickness of the food or drink it is mixed with. Overall, its a good product and I will probably use it for years to come."
3,"Not ""tasteless""","I bought this to use in smoothies for a balanced meal. I had tried another brand and didn't like the strong vanilla taste, so I bought this because it was described as being virtually tasteless. However, after using it for a couple of days, it too has a very noticeable vanilla taste, which isn't terrible but not desired. It looks like full-fat powdered milk and produced a thickened creamy consistency to my smoothies. I guess I should have realized that there would be some taste to it, but I am not familiar with protein powders. Maybe this is as ""virtually tasteless"" as it gets."
2,"Seemingly great nutrition value, but tastes awful","This product appears to have awesome nutritional value, but I don't know how people could say it's completely tasteless! I mixed it with skim milk and it tasted SO GROSS! Enough to almost make me gag. I think it would be fine in some kind of food...They are right about one thing though, it does smell really good. I guess that's something lol."
5,Best whey without extra garbage in it,"I love this protein powder simply because its does not have all the garbage that other powders come with, such as sweeteners, and artificial flavors. it mixes very easily with water, has a bit unpleasant smell to it once mixed, but tastes pretty good. I like it a lot."
5,This is the classic of Tina's and Phil Spector's careers.,"Never a big hit in North America, it was a sensation in Europe for several years. Featuring Spector's manic and luscious production style , and Tina's searing vocals, it takes off where Motown ends. One the classic records of the sixties which sounds like it was recorded yesterday."
4,Good but might be defective,Autometer normally makes very good gauges. This one is particularly well made. You have to pull a vacuum line all the way from your dashboard (or gauge pod) to your turbo which can be problematic. The vacuum line supplied with the gauge is a joke. It thin and would bent while you pull it. Or melt if it would be touching your engine. I have enclosed the line into a rubber tubing to keep it safe. You can grab such tubing in any Home Depot or OSH. Also I advise to use bigger diameter T-fitting for connecting to the turbo control valve. But when it's all done and working you'll be happy :-).Note that the is a flaw in some of the boost gauges. It can rattle (or shake) on low engine RPM. This is very annoying. I had to change a few of boost gauge until I found one which does not do this and keep steady though the whole RPM range.
5,Great!!!,"My son, who has Down Syndrome is currently obsessed with HEE HAW. He loves to watch the videos over and over and over. Hahaha. His Dad and I have enjoyed them also."
2,White Wall Tires,"The picture shows a very fine lined white wall tire, the ones I received were not of the same quality. The white wall oscilates up and down around the circumference of the tire making it look of very poor quality. I ended up doing a custom vogue tire so it really didn't matter, but if you're looking for good quality, keep searching unless you're willing to either sand off the excess around the tires or modify them in some way."
3,Misleading Name,"This cat litter is not bad: it clumps, it flushes, the texture seems readily accepted by my cat...But let's be honest, this litter is the World's Best in marketing terms only.It's not great at clumping, the ""clumps"" tend to fall apart, and this litter does NOTHING for odor control.I guess a more appropriate name, WORLD'S MOST MEDIOCRE would not be as marketable."
3,Diggers has a mistake!,"This is a really cool book, but it has a mistake! It says diggers have crawler tracks, then on the next page, it shows a different kind of a machine- not even a digger. I wanted to write to the author, but we can't find that address. But besides that, it is a great book."
1,over rated?,"Yes! Sounds like a half-assed rip off of Al Green or James Brown as performed by Jamiroqui(sp?) with a bunch of trite and obvious social conscience nonsense thrown in. ""Why do they say never say never when they just said never twice?"" Why do morons pretend to be deep by asking stupid questions? Why did I just waste [money] on this limp crap? I'll throw this out of car window as soon as I can. Buy this for your girlfriend is she's a stupid hippy who'll fall for this transparent bitch-made line of BS. Why does music that ""portrays women in a positive light"" have to be so boring! Also, some decent beats wouldn't hurt. This clown should be shot into the sun with Jeru the Damaja and Lauren Hill."
1,"long awaited, but","this album was not as good as i expected it to be i listened carefully to the entire album and it's not up to expectations. Like water for chocolate was not as good as resurection or one day, so he gets no props for this one. He's my favorite mc, but I'm a producer that can make way better beats than that. I'm on webtv, so check my out and drop a line or two. Peace to the Gods and the Earths."
1,WHO IS COMMON !,"WELL ALL I KNOW IS TRACK 5 THE LIGHT IS THE BEST TRACK ON THE CD.COMMON SAYS HE'S FROM CHICAGO,IL YA RIGHT HE'S MAKING THE CHICAGO HIP HOP LOOK BAD.HE SHOULD JUST SAY HE'S FROM NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEY.DON'T BUY THIS CD IT'S JUNK.BUY THE SINGLE ""THE LIGHT"""
3,Middle of the road,"I've always been a fan of Common's work, but of late it seems he's hit a bit of a wall. Perhaps trying too hard to be intelligent, his lyrics come off a bit boring, and in some cases contrived. The beats don't bang, but they aren't soft either. This is definitely one CD you won't be poppin' in your car stereo, it's more of a relaxin' at home disc. Newcomers to Common's work might want to check out Resurrection for his best, most complete work to date. His debut album is good also."
4,All about the lyrics,"As far as the lyrics go, it's straight up Common. Real lyrics, real life, with a paced smooth flow. As far as the beats go, I don't really care for them much. The whole dj remixing sounds muffled, doesn't seem like it was mastered right, but then again, who am I to criticize?"
5,Sooo good,"This album is soo good, it wreaks of freashness, rythm and good lyrics. Common is one mc to stand out, he may put out smart and positive lyrics on one track but on the next he's talkin trash, but in a fun way., The production is really tight (exuctive produced by Questlove of the Roots). the beats are so cool, and often get u movin, but also theres alot of tracks to just chill by, which is one of the things i like in the hiphop music i listen to. All i gotta do now is maybe invest in some of his previous ones, like the so-called ""classic"" ""Ressurection""."
4,Not your average rap.,"Since I'm not really a Roots fan, the style of rap takes some getting used to for me. His songs are more jazz-like and some songs come off sounding pretty nice while others could be better. I have to give Common props for his rhymes and the thought he puts into them. I love Canibus' battle style but it's nice to hear somebody trying to get a few things off his chest. ""Questions"" is a good song and I like some of the issues he addresses, especially the one about race being all in the mind. If you usually listen to more mainstream rappers, I'd suggest you give Common a listen and see what you think. Not a party album, but a relaxed CD to hear."
3,Middle of the Road,"Don't get me wrong, Common is a great emcee, but lately it seems he's hit a bit of a wall. Torn between his natural lyrical skills and his desire to be too ""conscious"", his latest CD comes off as boring. His lyrics are sometimes remarkable, but other times terribly contrived. The beats definitely don't bang, so you probably won't be poppin' this one in your car stereo anytime soon.The best I can say for this one is that if you're a Common fan, then pick this one up. If you're someone looking for some of his best work, I'd pick up Resurrection. Like Water for Chocolate might be a disappointing place to start."
3,"Lyrics pretty hot, beats pretty much not.","Disappointing. If Common were a second-rate rapper I would have thought this album was pretty sick but I expect more from him. One Day It'll All Make Since is a vastly superior album. Better beats, better rapping, and better delivery. The best song (The 6th Sense) is the single and the rest of the songs pale in comparison. The second single (The Light) is a fairly good song but if you're looking for the near perfection the first single displayed you will be quite dismayed. The first track, Thelonious, Geto Heaven Pt. Two, and A song for Assata are the other decent songs. However, none of them have the production quality, the rapping quality, or the lyrical quality of the first sing. If this was his only album he'd be a one (maybe two) hit wonder! Not a bad album, if you like Common, I recommend it, but I would buy One day It'll... or Resurrection before you get this one. It's better than Can I borrow a dollar? but not his best work."
4,One of the greatest releases of the year 2000,"Common made an excelent album. ""Like Water For Chocolate"" ain't that average album that a lot of artists r dropping right now. The production is tight, the lyrics r great and it's an album for you to kick back and relax at your crib...With the exception of ""A song for Massada"", the rest of the album is enjoyable, that's why I don't give the half-missed mic. Common undoubtedly remains underground, altough he went gold with this CD, but he's not a sell-out rapper, he knows what he does and this CD proves that this cat got a lot of talent."
5,another classic,yo this joint is tight. yo common bringing it for all those who are willing to listen support the man go cope the album
5,Common makes all the sense in the world to me,"I like hip hop music that also educates. Common never disappoints. On this CD, I learned about Asata Shakur and a little about her history (enough to make me read and research more). As always, I learned a little about Common's family and his family values.I would be hard presed if I had to choose a favorite. I like all the tracks.Common, like The Roots,Mos Def&Black Star,Rakim, Brand Nubian(and so many others) have a story to tell that is chock full of knowledge. The beats are contemporary enough that they keep young listeners interested. Hopefully as they are listening, they will also learn. After all, isn't that what HIP HOP is supposed to be about?Like Water for Chocolate is worth every penny. I was one of those people at the CD store on the Tuesday that this CD was released. I knew I wanted the next Common CD without ever listening to any of the tracks. Common is one of the rare artists I buy without a test drive and again I was not disappointed."
3,Pretty Good...,"I Heard This album it was okay, but the song i really loved was""The Light"" Other Songs were okay."
3,"A great Roots album, but this is Com Sense","Like Water for Chocolate is a solid album, but it just sounds like another Roots album given the production. What happened to Common's usual production partner No ID? No ID's beat were part of Common's sound...they were as formidable a duo as Guru and Premier. No ID is one of the greatest secrets in hip hop...his beats beat ?uestlove's anyday...Common would have to done well to stick with him."
2,A Very Boring Album,"I Had Bought This CD When It First Came Out. I Was Buying This CD For The Single ""The Sixth Sense"" and Not For The SO-SO Hit ""The Light"" Cuz ""The Light"" Really Isnt That Good Of A Song. This CD Will Bore The Hell Out Of You, You Wont Even Be Able To To Listen To All Of The Songs Off This CD Cause There Is Only Really One Good Song Of This CD. I Really Thought That Common Was Gonna Do Somethin Good With This CD, But All Common Does Is Bore With His Talk ABout The Light And Stuff That I Really Can't Understand. If You Really Like The Hits Off The CD Then Buy The Single Cause Common Is To In Deep and You Wont Get Your Money's Worth. I am Not Suprised That Common Did This. I Guess His Just a So-So Rapper."
4,Uncommon,"Hearing an album with melodies as crisp as these today are getting rare. Hip Hop is changing, but Common is able to stand his ground and make good music. Not bad at all."
4,I am sick of 'cool' independent rap,"INDEPENDENT/BACKPACKER/UNDERGROUND RAP IS BORING AND MONOTONOUS with every single song talking about how hip hop they are and how much they hate 'shiny suit fake gambino' mcs. It's gotten so old I can't stand it.. anywaysCommon, is one of the few so called 'independent' rappers left who makes real music, and who actually says things in his songs. All of Common's albums are different and good. This is no exception, he's got a song for everybody, and they are all done great. Done great by Jay Dee, and if you don't already know, Jay Dee is part of a group called Slum Village (On track 12 I think, ""Thelonius"") has their album out and it's produced by him also. Get this album and Common's ""Resurrection"" and get ""Fantastic Vol. 2"" by Slum Village, okay?"
5,OF Course A Classic.,"Common did his thing. That's all you need to know, and that's all I have to say."
4,"Great album, hands down","Well, Baghdad part 3 took the words right out of my mouth. This album is excellent. My favorite song is ""A Film Called (Pimp)"" featuring MC Lyte and then-newcomer Bilal, but I don't think people understood that this song was a parody. ""The 6th Sense"" (also featuring Bilal) had me going ape because this was the first time Common and DJ Premier did a track together!!! However, that song seemed ill-placed because the rest of the album contains live production courtesy of the Soulquarians (?uestlove, James Poysner, D'Angelo, Jay Dee, and others). Also, even though Common works well with his new production team, I still miss No I.D., his producer for some of his best tracks from his last albums.At 77 minutes, it'll be hard to listen to this album all in one sitting, but it's time well spent. An instant classic."
4,Well made,"I initially bought this for ""the light""...My favorite track on it.The rest of the album isn't that exciting, as most of the songs sound similar musically. However, that does not mean all the songs are alike lyrically. I think this music is an acquired taste, something that after repeated listening will be more appreciated and understood as well crafted music."
2,Average at Best,I Like Common's Vibe as a Lyricist&Rapper but the Music feels too Much Like Formula.IRespect Quest-Love The Roots&Crew but I'm Getting tired Of Hearing Q&D'angelo on everything.they should have made his Album More Original for a 5 year Wait.Quest didn't give D'angelo Nothing as far as Beats so I Knew it would be Worse for Common and it is.COMMON reminds Me of ICE CUBE in The early 90's when his voice would hit but the music was wack.same case here.I Prefer One Day It'll Make Sense Better Overall.Still COMMON can Drop SCIENCE he just needs The Best Production to make it hit all the way.
5,masterpiece,"common is one of the few non-wu-tang emcees whose album really deserves 5 stars for quality of production, blazing hot lyrics and an excellent overall ability to speak what's on his mind. this is NOT the average hip hop album that people will buy and say its great because they saw it on mtv or wahteverone of the best thing about this album is its lack of commercialism. it is and it sounds underground. its one of those bright works of art that you really find yourself addicted to. this album reminds me of nas's illmatic. one of the best albums to come out lately , in the last few years, and remember millions of albums came out. do yourself a favor and get this. if you are an illmatic head, and keep wandereing when nas is gonna drop another thing like illmatic, this is the album youve been waiting for, only its not nas, but an emcee of the same level, common, who just dropped a 5 star album."
1,politics of race,This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism.
3,Decent middle-period release,"In the '80s there sometimes was no escaping that thumping, mechanized, ugly drum sound, even in reggae. ""Culture in Culture"" a decent release from the great reggae group Culture's mediocre middle period, is nowhere near its best but neither is it the worst effort, occasionally rising above the drum sound and an extremely slow beginning. The second track, ""Capture Rasta"" is dancehall reggae, which I hate. The disc rights itself, though, with serviceable but not revelatory songs such as ""This Way"", ""Step Along"" and ""Praise Him"". ""Soon Come,"" the next-to-last song, finally ups the ante with a distinctive, very strong tune about South Africa. Overall, average is the byword, worth having but not essential."
3,Not the best album in my opinion,"Being a new fan, I am not as knowledgeable about Dalida's creative path as the previous reviewer, but I own 2 CDs so far: this one and Master Serie (a French-made digest on a single disc). The difference is so stark that sometimes it's hard to tell it is the same singer. In the Master Serie, Dalida's voice is full, fresh, vibrant, and there is a lot of heart in it. In contrast, Les Annees Orlando CD seems flat and listless but for a few songs, and Dalida's voice is more hoarse and lacks strength and vitality, making for a CD that entertains with diversity of the repertoire but disappoints with a lack of ""personality""."
2,Terribly overpriced for the content.,"I did not buy this DVD, but viewed a rental copy. I strongly suggest you seek out other reasonably priced James Dean DVD products. This disc contains only two James Dean TV features, Hill Number One and The Bells of Cockaigne. It also includes a 15 minute feature called Hollywood Remembers James Dean. The two TV features are average viewing quality and both are available on many other less costly discs. The Hollywood Remembers James Dean feature contains nothing at all new about James Dean and features mostly clips of Dean's movies and some other TV snipets, hardly worth the price tag. Strongly suggest that you skip this one."
4,A great ESL resource,"This book is an original, readable resource for ESL instructors. The basic premise is to organize English grammar according to the errors which learners often make. The authors clearly have extensive experience in teaching ESL, as the examples are insightful and well-organized. Furthermore, the book is not bogged down with jargon. It is to the point and readily applicable. I only wish that it were longer, and still in print. (It's very difficult to find.) I hope Burt and Kiparsky write a new edition or get this book back into print."
2,"this is NOT a six inch flashing... just so you know it's 8.5""","I needed a 6 inch flashing for an outdoor fireplace in my screen room. local big box store didn't have what I needed, I thought this would help. my stovepipe is 6"", no more, no less.I got this and found it swallowed up that pipe and had a big gap all around. contacted the seller and they said the opening is 8.5 inches and that my 6 inch pipe should fit in it.... well yeah... but why not just tell people this is a 8.5 inch flashing. the fact is it is NOT a 6 inch flashing.I ended up going to home depot, bought a 6 inch roof jack that had a cap attached and hacked it, cut the cap off. my six inch pipe fit nicely inside the real six inch flashing.the seller has agreed to cover the postage and offer full refund"
4,thing,Unit was what I expected. The review process after purchasing seems to be a pain. Can you imagine if you you had to do this for everything purchased?
5,Awesome Planes!,"My brothers and I played with these things all through childhood. Sure, they're light and can be broken easily, but come on, they're made of balsa wood! They're so much more fun than paper airplanes though. If you're going to buy one, I suggest buying some extra rubber bands too. Just in case. Have fun!"
4,Too brittle,"Pros: easy to put together, decent flight.Cons: Too brittle. Within 5 minutes the rear horizontal stabilizer split, the fuselage broke.Conclusion: expect to discard the toy after 15 min of play. I am personally fine with that.EDIT: 4 months later my son prefers this half-broken plane to new RC helicopter. It is definitely a better flier."
3,Good for a first novel,"The book itself was engaging, but a few characters came and went with no impact whatsoever, after a couple of pages were wasted on them. A lot of the ends needed to be tied up. And the CONSTANT product placement of Kate Spade and the authors husband, Johnathan Pierce, tended to get a bit annoying. Overall, though, worth a couple of hours."
5,Great book with a likeable main character,"I really enjoyed this book, the characters, the setting and the plot. It was an easy read and very interesting throughout. I definitely want to see what Savannah does next!"
2,Would rather visit Savannah,"Other than a mindless beach read, this book was a big disappointment. The main character was silly and immature -- and should I add spoiled rotten. The plot was very contrived. The timing was unrealistic -- imagine trying to come up with an investigative story of this magnitude within a week -- give me a break! I don't think I will plan to read later books in the series, unless I am truly bored stiff!"
2,Presumptuous,"This book feels presumptuous. That is the only way I can describe it. The writing is hardly worth recommending to anyone, and Savannah is a spoiled brat. How this entire town can be in awe of this girl and her family is beyond me. She does not prove herself in the end at all. This book has gone straight into my resell pile."
1,I must have read another book,"After reading the stellar reviews of this book, I was very excited to read it. Apparently I read an alternate version of this book, because I found it OK but overall dull. I kept skipping pages trying to get at what I thought would be answers to the big ""investigation"" Savannah was conducting. Instead it was a rambling, cutesy tale that just bored me. Perhaps you need to be from the South or into beauty pageants to appreciate this book, and I am neither."
2,Huge disappointment,"I was very excited to read this book as I'm fascinated by the city Savannah (although I've never been there). I also love chick-lit. I was set to love this book and almost bought all three in the series and now I'm so glad I only bought the first one. There were several things wrong with this book. Certain things were set up to seemingly become something bigger (Katherine, the judges and auditors, etc.) and then were never followed up on. Other things just did not make any sense at all (her first article for instance, Emma's reaction, her mom). The story was very ""choppy"". For an author's first try I didn't think this book was that bad but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. I do not plan to read the other two."
4,Definitely a good book,"In spite of the reviews, I really enjoyed this book. Savannah was a good character, and I found that I wanted to hear more about her. I'm looking forward to the next book."
5,Wow!!! What a voice,Cara Mia has got to be my favorite. In fact this cd's 10 songs are super. Can't say enough about Jay Black's mesmerizing voice.
3,"Nice Selection, Good Price, No Artwork, Notes or Tracked","Great selection of songs, and the quality is first rate too.Alas no artwook, no dates of the recording nor information about the group or the songs, and the CD is not set up with freedb.com, so if you are ripping the CD, you have to manually input the songs.If that doesn't bother you, then save some bucks and get this verion. If it does, then get the higher priced product."
4,Jay & The Americans Greatest Hits CD,CD was great for getting all of the hits of Jay & the Americans on my i-pod. I actually knew more songs than I thought.
4,Songs featured randomly,"""This Magic Moment"" was played in the movie ""Andre"" a movie about a seal made in the late 80s and 90s. ""Cara Mia"" is a classic as well, it is always played at Italian festivals. ""Come A Little Bit Closer"" is another good song. This is a pretty good album, but don't pay a fortune for it."
3,Quantity and quality!,"Three of the tracks were not a greatest hit. Left out ""Only in America"" and ""Goodbye Boys Goodbye""!Sound quality was just, only okay......"
3,Okay for the price,"If you just want 10 singles by the group this is the way to go, however there are better compilations out there with more tracks and more hits."
5,Wonderful Music,"Jay Black has one of the most operatic voices in rock and roll! Listen to him belt out ""Cara Mia""- I believe he holds one note for over fifteen seconds. Jay's powerful voice is reminicint of Roy Orbison's.This is a stunning collection. It's the kind of music that really pumps you up and gets you going. It energizes!To me, the best is ""Walkin' In The Rain""- the character in the song is lonely- but confident he'll meet the right girl someday, unlike Roy Orbison's lonely boy character that has all but given up.This is positive stuff- bright, sunny, and full of vim and vigor. Perfect to pop in the walkman and run with!This collection is a winner- and budget priced to boot!"
3,"Black, Blatt, Whatever","My longtime ""oldies"" DJ friend has a ""guidebook"" for making chit-chat about the oldies stars and HIS book says Jay is aka ROBERT Black. Whatever the case, I guess we'll never hear HIM sing ""She Cried"". The presentation of the group's hits on this piece of work could be better. The hits themselves speak for themselves but a much better album is ""Come a Little Bit Closer -The Best of Jay and the Americans"", a more complete album for about the same price. Check it out."
5,Jay and the Americans Greatest Hits,Just what I was looking for! Love them and Love their music!One of the greatest male voices..
3,Azafran,"El libro narra la historia de un musulmán, que emprende un viaje desde su ciudad natal, donde Los Cristianos han tomado control y la religión musulmana esta casi prescrita.Por azares de la vida va conociendo a diferentes personajes durante su camino y lo que partió como un viaje en busca de una ciudad donde pudiese vivir su religión, se convirtió en una viaje de conocimiento y una verdadera peregrinación. En la medida que avanza va conociendo la Religión Musulmana, Judia y por último la Cristiana.Es un libro para leer con calma, al menos para mi, no fue de esos libros que uno toma y no puede soltar más.Admito que me leí varias novelitas cortas entremedio. Pero finalmentemente resulta un buen libro, que muestra la época de siglo XIII en España y como fue la convivencia de estas religiones con sus aciertas y desaciertos."
4,Lladró Love Nest Figurine,i got a great price from this vendor SUPREME 4 LESS and would not hesitate to buy from them again
5,The Best Anime I Watch for Years =),"I have to say I am suprised by how well the story and the character design of this anime. Even I am a fan of DMC game, I usually don't expect much from this type of ""Videogame-Anime"". However, I am wrong this time and they did a great job on my most beloved action game. Dante is just as cool as ever; I love it!!!The dynamic between the characters are excellent and I love it the most especially when Dante got abuse by the ""Big 3"". ha...ha...."
3,Devil May Cry,"This animated series is overall pretty good. The animation is great, and the scores and voice overs are done well. My only complaint is that the dialouge in parts is REALLY cheesey! I mean REALLY!!!! even for Dante."
2,They should have wished for a better Episode...,"This episode was weak. Weak as in not very exciting, I could almost guess the plot when it reached the halfway mark. The only funny thing is when Dante is in the prison but I will not spoil it for anyone who really does want to see it. I just felt they could have done something different. There were only one or two fight sequences the last one was pretty good but the first one bored me to death. Personally it's the weakest episode out of the bunch so far."
3,Rock on,"This episode felt a little short, I felt the fight sequences weren't the best and there were mega short plus Dante didn't have any snappy comebacks to be honest. I liked the story line of the episode but overall could have been better."
5,Love The Hog,FRAM Air Hog filters are great adds mpg without much work just change filter. Reusable so the little increase in price is less than the price of two good air filters. Just be sure to order cleaner and reoil kit at same time.EASY MPG UPGRADE!
5,Great Unit,"Was just what I had been looking for, fit like a glove. It does require oiling the filter but that is to be expected with a washable filter."
3,Interesting,this cd is actually pretty good. shes got some hot beats and all. singing and rapping may not be the best but pretty cool to listen too.
1,"Three words, Lil Kim Wannabe","I recently heard about Adassa through a friend, and I thought she was going be a good female MC, because I don't really like Reggaeton. The album is garbage let me tell you. If I could give it a negative 1 staw I would. She sings and raps about sex, biting off Lil Kim. Her image and style is very similiar to Lil Kim. All I have to say to Adassa is. You can't rap, and you should try to find another profession, because you're wack at hip hop. And stop trying to be like LiL Kim."
3,"OK album, but for starters only","I believe there are only one or two 'new' songs on the album, the rest is old stuff. It's an ok album to get to know the band, how they were and how they are nowadays (I'm referring to the 'exchange' of Fish with Steve Hogarth). The only 'new' song, which doesn't appear on any other album would be the last song - 'Sympathy', which is a cover, (and therefore) not really Marillion-like, if you ask me. Don't buy it if you already have the other CDs, but otherwise a nice 'get to know' album."
5,Insiders Guide To Buying Thoroughbreds At Auction,"This video takes the guess work out of looking at horses at the public auction before it begins. It is intimidating enough when you are actually bidding on the particular horses that you picked, but this video answers questions for deciding which horses to bid on , which to let go, and arms you with information to be bidding agaist the ""pros"". The video is in crystal clear format and presented easily enough for the novice to comprehend. I watch this movie before every auction I attend in order to review their advice so all the information is fresh in my mind. This is a great video to add to your equestrian library."
4,Miss Silver investigates,"Two young girls yearn to be free of their evil and cruel aunt's stranglehold on them, but they feel helpless...until suddenly a handsome, kind-hearted stranger shows up, and with Miss Silver, lends a helping hand.Liked this book because of the unexpected twist of plots and moving descriptions of characters and settings. Enjoyable read."
3,"Missing Persons, Jewel Thefts and Corporate Espionage","I think this book suffers from too many plot lines, and as a result some of them get lost in the shuffle. For example, the coporate espionage line kind of fizzles out, and with that drop out an interesting line of enquiry is lost. As a matter of fact, Miss Silver is sent to Hazel Green to examine the extent of this espionage, and it doesn't appear that she even gives it a thought, let alone try to investigate the angle. But there are still some interesting characters, both bad and good, and Miss Silver is her usual unflappable self even under extreme stress. The book is OK, but not one of my favourites. And, I really didn't like the fair Rosamund. She's too meek mannered to be believed, and certainly doesn't make a very lasting impression on the book like a female heroine is supposed to. We need someone with a lot more spunk to even out the story, and in order to have a strong foil for the really bad person in this book."
1,the difficulties all are easy and pethetic,"this game is sooo easy and was a waste of my money, i can beat it on all difficulties. im not a very good chess player either. It would be awsome if it were hard, BUT FFS THIS IS SOOO DAMN EASY"
3,The picture is not accurate,The picture for this product would indicate you're getting straps with the pole. This is not the case. You are only getting a short telescoping pole. I have a 23 foot cuddy cabin and the pole is too short. I had to prop it up on a cooler to make the pole long enough. I thing the right purchase would be a whole kit.
1,too muddled to be useful or recommended,"I speak on the subject of natural landscaping frequently - I've been doing this for years.I always search out useful references so audiences can go home and apply what we've discussed. I would not recommend this book. This book muddles the concept of ""natural"" and ""native"" to the point that an inexperienced gardener is likely to plant invasive, non-native plants and never realize they have created a disaster where they hoped to create environemental harmony in their yard. Awhile after the fact they may realize what has happened - I speak to disappointed homeowners often.Diekelman's book of the same title is much better, especially for folks in the Midwest.It is somewhat techincial, so may be a little dense for beginners, but at least it won't cause mistakes, disappointment and regret."
1,Prejudist's view with age old myth,"I have watch this show and did not like it due to the fact that it makes cats look like a criminal. It told of ancient Egyptians was in actulaly been enslaved by cats instead of the Egyptians just loving the cats. My nephew Jason Yoder watched it at one time, I believe. Which resulted in him disliking cats. It is to my oppinion that this video teaches a kid how to be prejudice. I afraid some poor kids who watches this video will think that all cats are like that and start throwing stones at any cat he sees. This show is not for the young children who cannot tell rather something is faked or real."
1,So unfair...,"It's incredibly unfair that they make cats the enemy and dogs the hero! I would understand if the CATS are the ones who chase and kill DOGS, but it's the other way around and they STILL make cats the enemy! And it's not only in this movie that they make cats the enemy, it's happened in a ton of other movies (ex: Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, Tom and Jerry, The Great Mouse Detective). No offense to you dog-lovers out there, but cats are actually smarter that dogs (face the facts) and this movie makes them look stupid (and you CAN train a cat to do tricks, I've done it with my cat. It's just that cats work for treats and dogs work for praise). I am a cat-lover and I think that this movie is extremely unfair to cats. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A CAT-LOVER!!!!!"
2,It's OK,"This is not exactly a cool movie. It has funny parts, but all in all, it is a dumb movie about crime-fighting dogs and cats who hate each other. Basic story: Kid loses dog, gets new dog, hates dog, befriends dog, dog discovers a crime-fighting dog agency against cats hidden inside a doghouse. Stupid, right?"
3,The truth about Cats and Dogs,"This is a cute,funny little movie about an all-out war between cats and dogs.The wicked cats army is led by the terrible MrTinkles!!"
2,I like the fact that cats r trying 2 rule the world....,But this didn't cut it and the graphics were the main reason why. The moves of the animals were not real nor realistic. I know animals cannot do those moves anyway but it just didn't flow like it could even be close to real.Some parts were cute but all in all it wasn't a funny movie. I would say that if you're going to try this movie...rent it or lend it from a friend before you go out and spend money on it!!
2,AN OSCAR WORTHY MOVIE OF GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS. BREATHTAKING!,"this movie was awsome. i love a cat and dog, and when they fight it funny as ever in this movie. i love it . i love it. i love it. my boy is only 15 years old and he loves it. i watched it in the theatre like 5 times and i cant stop seeing the cute little dogs talking to each other. word to all the peeeps who made this movie. its pure genius and i love it. props to toby mcgwire for directing this masterpiece. i love you man. thnak you to warner bros for conceiving this oscar worthy script. if there were doggy and cat oscars these cats and dogs would win. they are so great in this movie. i wish i knew there names so i could tattoo them on my arm.SO I CANT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ENOUGH. ITS A FLAWLESS PIECE OF FILM FOR ALL AGES. IN THE RANKS OF CASABLANCA AND GODFATHER NO DOUBT. 10 **** A+ (WORD TOBY) JUST PLAYIN DAWG"
5,funny,"cats and dogs is a fun hilarious movie! It's about this pup raised in a barn and is adopted to a new family though, he finds he's supposed to live with a mann who is trying to find a cure to laergies and his evil cat mister. Tinkles and his team is trying to take over the world so humns will obey their every will etc.The pup joins this team of dogs who are tryimg to save the world from the cats etc. yeah you get the point XDanyways I read some reviews who say this is unfair to cats etc. Obviousely, these people have no sense of humor! I love both cats and dogs and this movie didn't affect that. So get a grip people!Anyways, thought I'd get that point out.I reccomend that if your a cat lover hopefully you will have a sense a humar and rember ... It'S JUST A MOVIE!!!"
3,Not The Greatest Movie,"This movie was good, but very far fetched. At times it got so boring it made you want to stop watching it. But I would recommend this video to small children up to 7. But for older kids and adults you will probably want to fall asleep during the movie! I thought this movie would be good and the commercials made it look really funny. But trust me, its not really that good!"
4,Semagood,"Cats & Dogs is a decent way to pass the time. Wheather you are a dog lover or a cat lover, you will have someone to root for. I have a friend who has a cat named Smokey. My friend roots for Smokey when he leaves little surprises buried around the yard for him to step in. Anyway that is besides the point. I would pick would pick a slobbering mongrel over a cat anyday of the week. I do think cats are funny though especially when they meow, If I had a cat I would get a piece of meat and dangle it so he would meow for meat, then I would give it to him and watch him enjoy a meaty treat."
1,"Anthony Michaels review for ""Cats and Dogs""","I don't understand why people wasted thier time with this garbage. Sure the special effects and acting is good. I have nothing against Jeff Goldblum's acting or Alec Baldwin's voice, but please! This movie has a creative story, but it is so unbelievable and so ""babyish"" that I don't believe how successful it was. If you have a young kid, like 5 or 6, then it might be entertaining for them. But, I thought it was dumb movie."
4,Cats and Dogs,This movie is very entertaining for my grand daughters. It's a great movie for the whole family. I enjoyed it as much as they did.
4,Enjoyable for the pre-teen crowd,"I rented this through Amazon's Video On Demand and watched it on our TiVo with my daughters, age 7 and 10. They both enjoyed the movie and were rooting for the dogs all the way through. The voice actors (Tobey Maguire, Alex Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Sean Hayes, etc) were well matched to the characters. This type of movie uses a lot of CGI to pull off the effects and it was well done. A great rainy afternoon escape."
4,Oh lighten up!,"I love this movie! Its just a plain, funny movie w/ heart. Its not a great movie by any means, but as a multiple cat owner, I could really see my cats portrayed in the movie. Funny movie."
3,i like talking animal movies,"and ""Cats and Dogs"" is a cute one. While this film was catered more to a younger audience, as a full fledged adult, I enjoyed viewing it. I laughed alot. The maids dressing up Mr. Tinkles the cat was my favorite part.yes, the acting was less than par, but for those of us who appreciate this genre of film, it has quite a few laughs and it's fun trying to figure out who is doing the voices.This is a good family film too."
1,Poor excuse for a family movie!,"We started out watching this movie as a family, by the time it was over only my 10 year old son was still watching, and even he was playing Game Boy at the same time. Not a good story, very canned and lifeless. Extremely unbelievable. Boring."
3,"Good effort, but doesn't quite make it","It turns out that there has been a cold war going on between cats and dogs for centuries--ever since humans escaped from bondage at the paws of their feline masters in the days of ancient Egypt. The cold war gets hot when Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum) develops a cure for the allergic reaction to dogs. The cats, led by the evil Mr. Tinkle (Sean Hayes), are determined to stop him and unleash all of the technology at their disposal to do so. It is up to the dogs, and a mistakenly recruited puppy named Lou (Toby Maguire), to protect them.The premise is good and the film is very funny at times, but it just can't sustain it's premise until the end. I was bored by the end of the film. Loved those ninja Siamese cats, though."
2,AWFUL!!!!,"1 and a half star would be the real ratin'!! When I first saw this on the DVD, I thought it was funny, but afterwards I realize the too much of animal creulty it this piece. Simply put out the only reason I still see it and it's my only favorite part in the movie in the endin' credits when their playin' ""What's New, Pussycat?!"" by Tom Jones!! a great song from a great singer!!"
2,winner: DOGS,"in films, usually the good guys win. Well the dogs were the good guys and the cats were the bad guys. The cats dont DIE they just suffer. You'll find out when you see the film yourself. The have a little war to claim who is better: cats or dogs. You must watch it to see the rest."
3,My Review,"I went to see the movie Cats and Dogs, when it first came to theaters. It was pretty good, but had a very predictable plot. All in all though, I'd say mabey rent it and see it once, but don't buy it."
1,Cats & Dogs,"This movie was very cheesy. The plot was horrible too. I just stopped paying attention after the first 3 minutes. I think there was ninja cats going after the dogs. Very wierd. Don't get this. Don't even rent it.I must say, I have know idea how people rate this 5 stars."
2,Strictly for the kiddies,"I went to see this one in the cinemas, haven't seen the DVD/video so these comments relate only to the movie itself. And also I should mention that I haven't seen the whole thing -- my wife and I walked out of the theater after about a 1/2 hour. Obviously it wasn't meant to be War and Peace or other high-brow theatrics, but I've seen some great movies oriented towards the younger audience, most recently Spy Kids which is a classic in my book (if you haven't already seen this one I strongly recommend it). I actually had rather high hopes for Cats & Dogs, it seemed so cute in the previews. But it's just too juvenile, not particularly great special effects for the pets, certainly not good acting (esp. not from Goldblum). Anyway, what more can I add to the fact we walked out of the theater. I think younger set, probably 8-10 and under, might like it, but if you're an adult who often likes the innocence and fun of Disney/Spy Kids/et. al. I'd say this one isn't worth the try."
1,Prejudice movie!,"This movie is NOT good for the kids! It teaches them how to be prejudice and will probably result in them hating cats! Cats are actually really sweet animals, like the complete opposite of what's shown in the movie. People, you shouldn't get this for your kids unless you want to teach them prejudism.Besides, the movie is full of lame, dry humor that's not funny at all. I saw it at a friend's house and I practically had to force myself to stay awake through the whole thing!It's not that I don't like dogs, cause I do, but this movie is a bad influence for the kids."
2,Its ok...,"The movie was ok....but I didn't like the idea that all ""cats"" are evil and all ""dogs"" are good. I mean some cats and some dogs are evil/good... but not all of them fit into one category. Other than that, I thought it was ok..."
4,Great for little kids and pretty good for parents,"My two year old son absolutely loves this movie. It's fairly entertaining for a parent to watch also, unlike a lot of kid's movies. My husband and I especially enjoyed this movie since we have 2 beagles and 2 cats. The special effects that animate the animal's faces are well done. The story is cute and coherent. If you are a pet lover or your child likes pets, get this movie."
5,Fun for the entire family,Cats & Dogs is a very good movie. Its a movie for kids and adults to enjoy. Its cute and funny with a pretty cool storyline. I love animation
5,Loved it!,Great fun for the whole family. We watched this for the first time when my daughter was 4. Very fun.
5,Great Children's Movie,Cats & Dogs captures the interest of children of all ages. It is also suited for adults. The special effects are great.
2,Somebody doesn't like cats...,"I rented this movie hoping for a fantasy look at the war between cats and dogs, but no, I didn't get that.What I did get was a movie making cats look pathetic, unintelligent, and evil, whilst the dogs wound up looking brave, noble, and smart. This contains essentially nothing but a bunch of dogs out smarting and beating up felines.Whoever thought of this must have had something against cats.It did make me chuckle once or twice, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1.I don't recommend this to anyone."
4,"Cat lovers, beware!","If you are a cat-lover, and are somewhat defensive about it, you may not truly appreciate the hilarity of this pro-canine family movie. With the cats bent on world domination, only the dogs and their intricate anti-espionage network can save the research scientist who is working to cure humans of their dog allergies. It's not Shakespeare, but it is certainly an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half with your kids."
4,CATS & DOGS rule!,"How cute is this movie? Very cute! I enjoyed it a lot. The special effects are great. It's basically about cats wanting to take over the world and it's up to the dogs to stop them. Yes, they talk which makes it even better! CATS & DOGS is filled with laughs from start to finish. The interations between the cats, dogs, and humans are hilarious and well done. CATS & DOGS battle it out in this slapstick comedy. Who will come out the winner? You'll have to watch it to find out."
3,I like Talking animal movies,"and I am not a child. I will admit that. Cats and Dogs is the latest of the genre, and I thought it was cute. ""Mr. Tinkles"" the ruler of cats stole the show. I think the animals were the best thing about this movie as the acting was horrendous by Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins. A lot of you are probably thinking that this is just a silly kids movie, but if you are a cat or dog lover, you just may find some of the antics of both creatures pretty funny.It is a mediocore film but for you fans of talking animal movies, you may be the only ones who can appreciate it.Oh and by the way, DOGS RULE!!"
5,Fun for everyone!,"This has to be up there with Shrek as one of the funniest, most clever movies of 2002. The beginning is a little slow, but as soon as the ""ninja cats"" scene arrives, the movies is non-stop laughs from there on! Particularly hillarious is the sequence where Mr. Tinkels and corhors abduct Mr. Tinkles' master and enter the factory. No annoying musical sequences and no token annoying charactors comonplace in children's movies to ruin the whole thing. Though noticably written for the child's mentality level (no sophisticatedly duisguised adult humor al la Shrek), this film is just as entertaining for adults, especially pet owners.Now it's been confirmed what I've always suspected...my cat Jabroni is scheeming to take over the world!"
5,5 stars for Mr. Tinkles!,"I thought this movie was great. Mr. Tinkles is halarious. His lines made me laugh so hard that I couldn't breath. The 3D animation, the voice acting and the characters are great! Very halarious."
5,I laughed 'til i cried,"This has got to be the funniest film I have seen. Even now when I think about Boris the russian cat I can't stop laughing.Don't buy this film if you are the type of person who likes to write an in-depth analysis on every film you see because you'll be disappointed. But thats not to say that if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (or whatever its called, I liked it anyway) youl won't like this."
5,Relax and enjoy the fun,"This is a movie for anyone who wants to just sit back and get in some good laughs. Sure, it's slapstick, but that doesn't mean it's not truly funny and original. By the number of guffaws I heard in the theater when I saw the film, I wasn't the only one who enjoyed it. The inept cat characters were a complete gas - poor Mr. Tinkles (the ""Blofeld"" of the evil cat underworld) needed to do a better job of recruiting goons. The doggie gags were perhaps expected but still funny (e.g., Butch with his head hanging out the window of the rocket sled). As one reviewer wisely suggest - at LEAST rent this movie, then you may decide (like me) that you simply MUST have a copy for your private collection."
2,Talking Cats and Dogs,Guess I am into spoofs and make believe in animals. I have never appreciated this kind of film but certain people like this kind of film. I like a little closer to real life not that I am a grown up..
4,The Battle Between Cats & Dogs.......................,"The movie is a story about an adventerous puppy named lou,he's mistaken for a new recruit from the academy where dogs train to pertect the human race from the Cats...You see, lou's new owners are related to Professer Brody,a Scientest trying to create to cure for dog allergies...The Cats are trying to get the forfula before people are able to have because if noboby was allergig to dogs more people would want them and then the Cats would be outcast,and out numbered in the battle between cats & dogs,but If the catys could get a hold of it they could reverse the formule so that EVERYONE would be allergic to dogs and they would be defeated at last!!!!!!!And one Cat named Mr. Tinkles,has got a plan to speard the reversed formula to everyone in the world!!!!!!!!That's why the dogs need someone to protect the Brody's, but can lou do that,can he beat the best the cat's can throw at him ????????????????????"
3,Good kids flick,"Hmmm... This was ok. We rented it this weekend. The kids watched it several times. The writers did a good job of coming up with lines for the animals.Special effects were just so-so. Nothing really special.If you have kids, this is a good one to pick up for them."
3,AVERAGE,"Three generations of my family watched this film over Christmas. The kids' attention wandered, and their grandparents fell asleep about two-thirds of the way through.The opening sequence is great, and the film has some good moments, but basically it's a single over-stretched joke, viz. ""live"" action of animals dressed as spies, ninjas, etc.In short the film is satisfactory, but did not live up to expectations. My kids got this and ""Shrek"" at Christmas, and it has been ""Shrek"" that has held everyone's attention."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"The ads for this movie looked like it would be a good movie for those of us who like cats & dogs--wrong. It was so painfully boring & lame, my friends & I couldn't stay thru the whole thing. I can't imagine children or adults liking this movie."
2,NOT what I thought ...,"Go on the assumption that this is going to be a ""CUTE"" movie for the animal lovers... BUT..... HUMMMMMM NO! I did NOT like this movie and just wish I had selected something else..."
5,Very funny movie,"This is a great movie that didn't get a lot of play in the theaters. Cat lovers may not like it a lot since cats are portrayed as the bad guys in the film, but I think any dog lover would really enjoy this film. The voice acting is fantastic and has a fun comedic beat. Check it out."
3,Cute & good for kids,"My reason for watchng this movie was mainly because I have cats. Even though cats were portayed as evil monsters it was still entertaining.The visual effects were very good but the story was a little weak, but what can you expect from a movie like this. The human actors were wasted, but then again they weren't the stars. Kids will especially enjoy the martial arts cats and Mr. Tinkles. As I'm writing this I actually think the cats had better parts.Anyway, rent or buy the kids will love it."
3,"Funny, But.......",Some parts of the movie are pretty funny. but for the most part this movie stinks. It was boring.
4,Mr. Tinkles steals the show!!!,"I have 2 daughters who absolutely loved this movie!! My 7 year-old was laughing so hard at times she couldn't catch her breath. Their friend, grandmother, father and I thought it was pretty funny, too. We all agree that Mr. Tinkles (the white cat) was the best part of the movie - he's hilarious! I would definitely give this one a thumbs up:)"
1,I Must Have Seen a Different Movie Than Everyone Else,After about 15 minutes it was mind-numbingly boring. I Fell asleep not long after that. I have a dog and a cat and I like them both but the movie was one big yawn...
1,I Can't believe someone would actually publish this!,"This movie is stupid and whoever made it must have a shallow, heartless mind! This is extremely childish and whoever made it should just GROW UP!! This has happened a million times in other movies, where the cat is the villain and the dog is the oh-so-valiant hero! Seriously, why doesn't someone do something new for a change and make the cat the hero??"
3,A family movie,Great for the kids...will make the young ones laugh with the fresh child friendly humor. Good for all ages boys and girls
3,Not great.,"I found the acting to be fairly poor in this show, especially the main character (the kid). It is a fairly cute concept but just very ok. My toddler liked it ok I guess. The animals are cute."
3,Not sure,"My five year old laughs out loud at the many ""cheap"", silly movies. This was ultra expensive with big time special effects and sophisticated plot. It was very much ""Hollywood."" All I can say is, my son watched it in a ""glazed over"" state. Mesmerized, but I don't really think in a good way. I wasn't particularly entertained. Also note that there's plenty of fighting in it."
3,Great songs & horrible songs makes an average album,"For the 10 rap songs on here, 1 classic, 4 great ones, 3 ok ones and 2 horrible ones, plus 3 bad R&B; songs. It has some big names and some not as well know cats. RZA,Raekwon & American Cream Team, Xzibit, Prodigy of Mobb Deep, Big Pun (R.I.P.) Kool G Rap, & Young Nooble & Napoleon of the Outlawz provide the quality songs on the album.#1 - 9.5 (Raekwon, American Cream Team, RZA)#2 - 7.5 (xzibit)#3 - 8.5 (prodigy of mobb deep)#4 - 9 (kool g rap & big Punisher (R.I.P.})#5 - 7 (everlast)#6 - 9 (raekwon)#7 - 2 (dead prz)#8 - 9 (american cream team & young noble & napoleon off the Outlawz)#9 - 10 (classic by: american cream team)#10 - 4 (queen pen f/ joe hooker -)#11 - 3 (R&B; song)#12 - 4 (l.V. -- another r&b; song)#13 - 1 (one more r&b; song)check all my reviews"
3,Spoiler Alert: I am unhappy with their choice for the winner!,"My wife had been warning me all through this season that the judges favored Anya. Towards the end it became so obvious that even I had to recognize it. They judges added or subtracted things from the challenges to help Anya. If the designers had to make two dresses, and one of Anya's was terrible, then it was decided that only one dress would be judged. At fashion week Anya's collection was nothing more than under-designed pajamas! Either Josh with his dramatic tastes or Viktor with his meticulous tailoring should have won! The season was still worth watching, but the judging was so unfair that I was left with a bad feeling! And this was the second season in a row that was unfairly judged!"
1,The Product was not reviewed,"I did not review this product. This product was presented to me as a download, and I wanted a DVD. So it was deleted from my purchase list. Thank you."
1,Digital-only is a drag... and a ripoff,"I sure wish this were available on DVD or Blu-Ray, so I could purchase it and watch it with my wife, as I have with every other season of Project Runway. I have absolutely zero interest in ""buying"" it in digital file format, and I represent nothing but lost revenue and bad feelings towards those who are pushing this inferior, overpriced format onto the show's fans. Boo. (Axton)"
5,Curse you Hulu!,"Thanks Amazon for offering individual episodes for purchase! After following Project Runway all season... and just as the competition was heating up, Hulu withdrew the final episodes! NOOOOOOOO!!!! But thanks to Amazon, and for just a couple bucks, CRISIS AVERTED! =DGreat series, loved every minute!"
5,awesome,so nice to see some of the band again. The young additions are in Chicago style and excellent. Glad we got it
2,Ok concert but these guys are getting old and their music is not up to what it used to be.,"An ok video for the concert lover but these guys don't sound anywhere as they did say 15 years ago. If your looking for concert DVDs from the 70s and 80s get the Doobie Brothers, STYX or REO Speedwagon which all are better and their sound is better with age."
2,dts-HD Master Audio lacks Center Channel,"Concert & video quality are outstanding and the lossless PCM stereo track is beautiful; however, there is no audible output to the center channel speaker from the dts-HD Master Audio track. I verified that this is not a problem with my decoder--all of my other Joe Thomas-produced ""Soundstage"" Blu-rays play dts-HD MA flawlessly. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy."
1,Wrong size pods,"I ordered the wrong size pods. I need pods that will fit my Breville. I need to exchange the pods I received. I have emailed 3 requests to the Seller to no avail. Please give me the return info to return them to you. I am very dissatisfied with this order.Please respond,Gary Gerlitz"
5,Great buy,I bought this itme for our anniversary and my wife loved it. It was also extremely competitively priced for a Lladro.
5,Simply Gorgeous,"I bought this piece to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The porcelain figurines are typical of Lladro, magnificent. My wife was happily surprised to add to her collection. The product is highly recommended."
1,Wrong Version of Song,I didn't realize the song that I wanted to hear was not the version that I wanted.
4,Machine Stitched Cathedral Stars - Shelley Swanland,"I loved the various projects within this book that I borrowed from a friend and promptly turned around and ordered my own copy. I've made Holiday Magic twice now (only because I could not give away my first one as planned) and hope to venture onto other projects from within soon.This is not a book for beginners as it is a bit confusing to follow, but with help from an experienced quilter you can definitely complete your project (which is how I started my first one). The only drawback I found was that the general construction directions are at the front of the book (same technique for all) and then the various projects follow with some added instructions and/or references to the front. That is something I did not care for (kept losing myself) but understand the reasoning for it.I've always been attracted to the Cathedral Windows technique but this is just a little more ""jazzier""! Thank you Shelley."
1,NOT A CANON PRODUCT,This is not a Canon product --despite what the photo looks like or how the product is described. It's a compatible ink cartridge.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,The product looks NOTHING like the photo. The finger was YELLOW. It looked like a 5 year old made it. I threw it right in the garbage. Don't waste your time or money with this company.
5,Easy & Excellent Meals,"This book is constantly in use at my house. The meals are generally easy and taste great. And surprisingly, they are good for you. I've tried many of the recipes and would recommend this to everyone. It's a staple in the kitchen."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,An interesting story if written by someone who wasn't trying to be a cheeky fellow. Would make a great story if written as a straight forward history/biography.
2,Frequently unintelligible due to poor writing and lack of punctuation.,"Maybe this is just the first, un-proofed edition. Maybe the soft cover will be readable. Or maybe neither the author nor the publisher knows anything about good writing, copy editing, or basic punctuation. Maybe in Australia and New Zealand this sort of writing is perfectly normal. At any rate, to paraphrase another reviewer, the subject is fascinating, but the book is crap. Perhaps the author had a stroke and no one noticed."
2,"Fascinating subject, terrible book","I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it delivers what it promises: a biography of the adventurer, criminal, spy, and policeman Eugene Vidocq. On the other hand, the book is so badly written that it makes reading about this fascinating man a chore. Although the book is organized (I use the term loosely) more or less chronologically, the narrative sporadically jumps forward in time at several points, such that I often found myself looking back through the last coupe of pages I'd read to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I put the book aside in frustration and/or confusion more than once, and it took me several attempts to slog through the entire thing. Vidocq deserves an engaging and compelling biography, but unfortunately this isn't it."
4,Stranger than Fiction,"The winds of fortune blow hot and cold for our hero Vidocq as he pursues careers ranging from the criminal to those of crime busting. However, Vidocq is a shrewd, intelligent individual that refuses to be pigeonholed by either of these pursuits. Prepare to be surprised and delighted by the many twists and hairpin turns of this exceptional man's unbelievable life."
5,AWESOME FIND!!!!,"I was actually looking for What a Girl Wants and Chasing Liberty when I was on Amazon.com, and up popped this double feature!!! What a steal!!! I was so excited to find a two for one deal!!! What a find, I am very happy with this purchase!!! Only on amazon can you such a great find!!!"
3,Wrong movies,"I was so much looking forward to having these movies in my library and the seller sent the wrong DVD inside. I ended up with Lethal Weapon I and II. I contacted Amazon and they credited my account immediately without asking to return it. I could have given it a 1 star but, Amazon stands behing their customers and it wasn't fair to Amazon. Thanks Amazon."
3,Painful Yet Honest,"I got bored one weekend and picked up this book that had been recommended to me by a male teacher. Once I got into the book, I had many mixed feelings. Nathan did some terrible things to young black women and reading those parts really made this black woman cringe. As bad as those things were, I got the feeling that while Nathan was writing them he felt they were the ""good ole days."" Illegitimate babies... Drugs... Gang Rape... all of the horrible things he did... well it was biographical. The reading is interesting... and honest and for that you have to give it to the man. The stories themselves were terrible."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I'm only about half way through, but was so moved by the end of the chapter called ""Sex"" that I had to stop and write.....Nathan McCall wrote one of the most beautiful and touching tributes to women that I have ever read. It brought tears to my eyes and made my heart ache."
5,If you live in the dark this will open your eyes.,I think that this book is one of the best ones I have ever read. McCall really gives people the real stuff that goes on in the world. This man is an example that anybody can turn there live around.
3,One Glaring Problem,"Let me be perfectly clear before I even begin. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think that it makes a telling social statement.Nevertheless, I couldn't help but be put off by Nathan McCall's hypocrisy toward black women. Throughout the book he bemoans the shabby, even cruel treatment he and his friends have netted out toward black women over the years. However, right up to the very end of the book he continues to boast of fathering children out of wedlock and of failing to provide adequate child support. I agree wholeheartedly with McCall's assesment of institutional racism and the drastic need to improve living and social conditions in the inner cities. However, if he's not going to take full and complete responsibility for the children he helps create, he needs to learn how to use a condom."
4,Hard Head to Good Sense,"Although I was going to put down the book during the first quarter, because of the vulgarity, I became absorbed in his transition into ""a butterfly"". It was interesting to see how the writer, McCall, had me anxiously wanting to completely see how he handled his next moves and decisions. His life reflects how, unfortunately, some very young men's course of action lead. TV and environment influenced, no doubt. His wanting to Holler, I can relate to as a Black woman. Just as you're believing everything will be smooth, a rocky mountain stands before us to climb. Interesting outcome and reading."
1,I failed a class because I refused to read this book,"Sometimes you have to stand up for stuff like that. I read the first third of this book, then pages here and there, and I was disgusted. I was digusted the same why as when I read American Psycho years later, but at least in AP's defense, it was FICTION. This book had potential, it could've been a real look at a system that doesn't care about the people that are in it, how he rose above all of this and achieved anyway. But Mr. Mcall seems happy just telling us how it's everybody's fault but our own, and ""did I tell you the time I gang-raped this girl?"" ""Or how it was some girl's fault that she got pregnant, and I'm not taking care of it"". This book marked my one and only failed class in college, I refused to finish it. I let my mother read some of it, and after she read about 10 pages, she completely supported my decision. There are much better books about the human condition, don't waste your time here."
1,"A hypocrit, child deserter, and a coward","How can Nathan McCall expect any sympathy from any person when he describes raping young women, young black women, and expresses absolutely no remorse? When he fathers children out of wedlock, and blames it on the women? When he cheats on women and tries to blame it on society. You're mad at the world Nathan, but it's everyone's fault but your own. Even beating a white kid half to death because he happened to ride a bike through your neighborhood is SOCIETY's fault. Oh please, break out the violins and give this guy a tissue to cry on. If you want to read a book that really covers this topic, read the classic Manchild in the Promised Land."
5,Take it for face value,"This book is a brave, clear, and honest image of the struggles of growing up in dangerous neighborhoods. Nate McCall will shock and possibly disgust you at times, but he should be praised for his brave look at his own life and misgivings, as well as his accomplishments.I think this is an important read for white folks especially. There is insight into a world that is many times difficult to understand. I have recommended this book to about a dozen people. Some loved it, some hated it, but everyone felt a new sense of understanding."
3,PRETTY GOOD BOOK,Nathan McCall is a very deep individual. I enjoyed his book as well as his insight - I really admired the way he explained his emotions and reasons for his behavoir growing up as a black man in America.
5,A great book detailing the frustrations of black males.,"Nathan McCall has written a awesome book detailing the frustrations of being black and male in the 1970s and much of what he felt then, is the same frustrations that our males are still faced with in today's society. McCall givesmore than enough realism as he depicts his life from the oldNathan to becoming the new Nathan. It is indeed a challenge and through the book he keeps hope alive and tries to do the right thing."
4,"One love, One success","I, like most of the reviewers here, read this book in 1995-96. I lived in this area (Portmouth-Norfolk) most of my life and I was impressed by Nathan's vivid writing. This book, among others, inspired me to release ""Masks of the Darkest American Game"" as my first book--a book that deals with an African-American youth that escapes the drug game and various sexual relationships to education, corporate success, and love. When Nathan's book is viewed as a product of expression, few have out done him in covering topics that everyone loves to criticise. Some topics are not going to be as easy-going as going to the West Indies and rebounding from a stress filled relationship with the person of your dreams. Nathan expressed his version of a black male's shortcomings for us to talk about it--and we did."
1,Profiting from pedophilia,"I have some serious ethical concerns about this book. While I admire the author for turning his life around and for the positive things he does to educate people about race relations, it is fundamentally unethical for him to profit from his crimes by writing them down and selling them to people. One major point of this book is his detailed confession of violent crimes, such as participation in the gang rape of a 13 year old girl. Every book that is sold advances this author professional and financially, thus allowing him to launch his professional career and bank account on the back, so to speak, of a child.People who participate in the rape of children should not get paid to report that experience: they should get imprisoned."
4,"good lessons, even though the author is a hypocrite","This is a valuable book with a lot of great lessons on what do to (and what not to do). I think it is good for both men and women, regardless of race. I read it several years ago and parts of it have really stuck with me and helped me to understand people in a different way, looking at it more from their perspective than I used to.As has already been mentioned, the author isn't the best role model, so skip it if that is what you're looking for. He's not all bad, but gang rape and beatings are among his accomplishments and those are described in detail. He has excuses for everything. He's a victim. Boo hoo.As has already been mentioned, perhaps he's a liar. Who knows. Regardless, I think this book will open you mind and is worth reading, if only to have an example of the kind of person to stay away from."
4,Strong Medicine,"This book scared me. Perhaps I was naive in believing that the criminal element in my race is mostly sprung from poor neighborhoods and sired in one-parent households. McCall proved that the call of the streets is so strong that it takes almost superhuman effort (and luck) to raise a black man safely to adulthood. The scariest part of the book is that McCall has no excuse for his early behavior. The book is good in that it shows things the way they really are. I, too, had to relfect on friends and relatives from my own middleclass neigborhood who went the way of the streets, though unlike McCall, they ended up dead or imprisoned for life. The book's weakness is in that it is never clear to the reader that McCall has truly understood the error of HIS ways, not just society's...."
2,Insightful & Irresponsible,"I first read this book in 1995 when it was released. Mr. McCall's struggle out of poverty and achievement of success as a reknowned journalist sets an excellent example.However, I was consistently surprised and dismayed by how he refuses to take responsibility for his actions as a youth, instead blaming white society for his troubles. This is a disturbing thread that continues throughout the book, and causes me to wonder if Mr. McCall really learned anything from his experiences, other than blaming everyone else for whatever problems you face in life."
5,Beginner's Luck,For a long time I have been interested in learning Linux but have been thwarted by not having a book written for beginers. The learning ladder was missing too many necessary bottom rungs... there was no starting point. Mr. Rais has supplied those missing rungs and has made it possible for me to now profit from those tomes which begin in mid-air. This book has been invaluable to me and I strongly recommend it to anyone else stuck at the starting line.
5,Linux Beginners Benefit as well as others through charity,"I just read the reviews here and having recently gotten ahold of this simple, easy, and actually enjoyable to read computer book! If that's not already telling you something about how useful this book is for beginners I don't know what else can! Technically scarry things put in to simple terms -- that's what I needed and that's what this book gave me.I'm shocked also by one of the reviews here on amazon that said ""its NOT worth every penny!"" The fact that the publisher and author have indicated they are donating the proceeds to the poor makes this even better and proves how Linux can help shape and change society not just computer use.I am all for this book: inexpensive, easy to read for beginners, and YES INDEED IT IS WELL WORTH IT knowing the proceeds will go to good causes not into a rich publishing monopoly pocket.I rate this 5 stars but would give it a 6 if there was such a rating."
3,not as good as expected,"I guess it's hard to find the right mix of ingredients to write a newbie book that's not insulting to the readers while at the same time not requiring lots of experience to understand everything. I have no Linux experience but still thought the book is a bit too ""dumbed down"". Also the last 30 or so pages are cutesy stories about getting people to use Linux without any real useful info."
4,Good review book,"Great book for review if you know Linux and need a refresher on the basics. Also good for a beginner, but it's far from a comprehensive review of all that Linux offers."
5,Excellent Product and Excellent Seller,"The product was excellent. The seller sent the wrong color, but quickly replaced it with the correct color and that was most appreciated. The train car fit perfectly on the set my grandson already had--so it was a great product and the seller was most accommodating--I really appreciated."
4,A good book in the wrong section of the store.,"I am and have been an avid reader of science fiction for some time, through this interest I was introduced to the writing of Joe Haldeman. I have also been through a number of books on the Vietnam experience, from ""The Quiet American"" to ""In the lake of the woods. From my varied reading interests I can assure the reader two things. First that Joe Haldeman is a great author, especially of science fiction. Second this is not a science fiction book. It is a good book, it is a powerful book, it is a meaningful book, but it is not science fiction. I just wanted to split that hair."
4,You wont be sorry...a perfect little gem,"This thin paperback that a friend suggested I read, sat there for a month or two. Once I picked it up, I did not put it down. ENJOY."
4,oddly captivating,"Very much of its 1966 British zeitgeist. It concerns the unlikely adventures of two friends, one a composer and pianist, the other a Nobel laureate physicist. The prose is glib and rather awkward at times, but something about this book is compelling in an indefinable way. Well, the social and philosophical speculation is intriguing; the glamor of the musician's life is attractive. I first read ""October the First is Too Late"" at age twelve or thirteen, and it may have helped decide me to take up music professionally (so to speak). Speaking of music, I also recommend George Heussenstamm's ""Norton Manual of Music Notation""."
3,Complicated as the novel,"Far-fetched scientific possibilities! In different universes and times, things happen to other peple who can be ourselves as much as others and we can never know if we have already been there, are there now or will there or never. As is, I am enough confused in being in this world, wether a hologram or not, I sharply feel the pain!"
4,excellent vocals and variety,"This is a well produced disc with a sharp rhythm section accented by horns on almost every track and sweet backup vocals from the ladies that contrast nicely with Blues Boy's gravelly voice. His vocals are one of the highlights of the album, he often sounds remarkably like B.B. King.The lyrics are on the humorous side, and the opening track ""I'm gonna marry my mother-in-law"" is quite racy.I enjoyed the variety of styles included, ranging from blues to funk to R&B. All are well executed. My favorite track is ""I've been shacking"" which has a fat groove, lots of energy and is catchy as hell.Blues Boy won't win any special attention for his guitar playing which only stands out on a couple of tracks. Overall I found this disc to be a pleasant surprise."
3,Not the best way to buy this music,"This 33-minute compilation of two EPs was remastered and re-issued in 1999 and that version is available on import. However, all eight tracks are available in freshly re-mastered sound on Lullabies To Violaine Volume 1, along with 24 other tracks, at a modest price."
5,One of the Best 80s eps ever,"This is one of the first eps i ever bought of the cocteau twins, and after buyign them all, its still one of my favorate, tiny dynamine shows a softer part of the band with the first two tracks, but with plain tiger its shows theres more sides to them, echoes in a shallow bay, god i cant say enouph about this ep. The cocteau twins said they wrote the first couple tracks in no time at all, just laid down some loops of music and had liz sing over it. i still listen to it today thinking how did they do that? and just happy to even be listening to it in aw..if your goign to buy any cocteau eps , this and ""ice-luck"" and the ""spangle maker"" are good for that mid-80s sound, for the classical goth sound all i can say it you need ""lullabies"", and ""peppermint pig"".-benjamin Esh..."
4,a mankind's view on heaven,"This is the legendary Bob Krasnow ruined album. If he's still alive he should be hung. The material on this album is fabulous, probably the best Beefheart ever made, I would certainly have rated it 10 stars when it was produced in a normal way, Krasnow produced it in such a way that it would sound more psychedellically to boost sales but in fact put a jewel in a pigs sty. Can you imagine heaven? Strictly Personal is heaven seen through a human's eye, you'll try to imagine, but you know you will never be able to get the complete idea. That's Strictly Personal. Still try it out, listen to it and try to listen through the bad production. Then buy ""I may be hungry but I sure ain't weird"" and enjoy it the way it should have sounded, a master piece."
4,"Trippy, Cool, and Fun","The only thing that prevents me from giving this album 5 stars is the inclusion of ""Mirror Man"" and ""Kandy Korn"" which are really crummy mixes (check out the album MIRROR MAN to hear these two classics in their definitive versions). Other than that, STRICTLY PERSONAL is great Beefheart. Not even the ""psychedelic bromo-seltzer"" (Don's words) added to some of the tracks can mar it. ""Safe As Milk"" (one of those songs that do not appear on the album of the same name; can you name three more?) and ""Beatle Bones 'N' Smokin' Stones"" were concert staples. The Captain never repeated himself and this album shows him and the band soaking up the Summer of Love vibes (as well as a few thousand micrograms) by way of Venus."
4,The music shines through like a diamond in the mud,"Although buried in psychedelic bromo-seltzer, the music shines through like a diamond in the mud. The takes on this album are better than those on the new versions of Safe As Milk and Mirror Man Sessions. According to [..] (one of the best fan sites of all time-check it out!), the un-phased tapes of the album have been found! I would be the first to buy the CD if it were released. If I knew who owned the tapes or the rights to them I would lobby them to release it. But like many Beefheart projects (e.g. the original Bat Chain Puller), it may be entangled in a legal spiderweb."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THE PLANNER IS FILLED WITH THE 5 YEARS, HOWEVER, THE DAYS OF THE WEEK ARE NOT LISTED. YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY WRITE THEM IN AND THAT IS A NUISANCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP FLIPPING TO BACK OF THE PLANNER, IN THAT WAY, I DON'T ACTUALLY FORESEE IT HOLDING UP TO THAT FOR 5 YEARS. ALSO, IT WOULD BE NICE IF HOLIDAYS WERE IN RED INK OR ANNOTATED IN SOME FORM. ADDITIONALLY, THE PAGES DON'T LAY DOWN FLAT AS YOU WRITE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SHIPPING, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE 2 TO 3 WEEKS BEFORE SHIPPING IS TO COMMENCE. I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE PLACING AND ORDER AND HAVING THE ITEM BEING SHIPPED 2 TO 3 WEEKS AFTER YOU PLACE THE ORDER, ALTHOUGH YOU ARE NOT CHARGED UNTIL THE ITEM IS ACTUALLY SHIPPED."
1,Poor Quality!,"This bracelet is poor quality of gemstones and poor craftsmanship. Gemstones are very cloudy and some of the joints in the chain or fused together and the bracelet therefore can't be straightened out completely. In other words, if you unfasten the bracelet and lay it out on the counter it will not form a straight line because some of the joints in the bracelet are fused together and do not bend so you cannot straighten the bracelet. Don't buy this, it's junk."
3,Pretty but not what I expected,"This is a very pretty bracelet, but the stones are much lighter in color than I expected. The stones had hardly any color to them."
4,NICE SURPRISE,"I wasn't sure how this would be, but I was presently surprised. Stones are a nice green color. Very nice for the price!"
5,bracelet,"gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous!The stones were a light green and a little cloudy but they still sparkle really brightly. The construction of the silver is solid."
4,Image Concious,Terrific little book filled with short provocative pieces about architecture and it's complicated relationship to publicity and image production.
2,No good!,"This item gives a loud hitting noise when you speak close to it. but away from it, it is too low. it is unidirectional so you have to try to find which way it works.The swich is at the botttom of handset, which is very awkward to use -- need both hands to operate the switch. and it is easily broken.If you have a defective item, seller is very reluctent for refund(they will ask for missing items even items you never saw before in your package). if you want an exchange, they will do it. Most of the time, if the item is defective, they do not admit it was quality problem. They demand an answer from you: "" what did you do to it?""--???"
1,waste of money,"Do not buy this product, and at this point would not recommend anything from go-video. The latter based on their poor customer support. Had for about 4 months, and battery died. Believe it or not a ""bug"" appears on the display!!!! Creepy!!! Apparently a known issue with product as they stated they were going to repair even though out of warranty. Sent in 12/05, and haven't seen since!! Calls and emails to customer service result in nothing but lip service or ""state you problem again"" after numerous previous contacts WITH their return auth #!When it was working? Pretty poor, horrible sound (well documented), and very limited flexibility both in playback and song compliations. There has NEVER been a firmware update since 5/05. Think they realize a poorly designed/manuf product and don't want to commit any more resources too....Even at $100 for 5G back then - total waste of money..."
2,FRAGILE,"WOrked OK as an MP3 player and FM tuner. (Reception marginal).However, my son dropped it from 3 ft onto ceramic tile and that crashed the harddrive. Permanently dead. That is too fragile for a portable music device."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This unit went dead within a week of receiving it. I contacted customer service and received an RMA# from ""Jose Gonzalez"" along with instructions on returning the unit. I shipped the unit by UPS, someone at the company signed for it, and I never heard anything else from them (this was over a year ago). They refuse to answer any e-mails, and their customer service number has appaently been disconnected. Over $100 down the drain....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY (GoVideo)!!!!!!"
1,Horrible!!!!Battery life only 2 1/2 hours!!!!,"This product is not worth your money. I bought one, it worked fine for the day. The next day, it shuts off at me after 5 hours of use! The battery is suppoised to be 10 hours. So I returned the product and exchanged it for a knew one. It only went for 2 1/2 gours this time!!!!!!! All in all, this is a great player if your only gonna listen like, 1/2 hour a day."
1,Doesn't work with XP home,It list good specs but I wouldn't know as it doesn't work with XP home and there are noe firmware updates/drivers for it.The companies web site is pathetic with no forums or any way to give feedback.It might make a good paper weight tho...
2,Stopped working in THREE weeks,"I loved the ARC mp3 player when it came out of the box. Looked great, sounded great, took it on a few jogs. It was very easy to download music onto it using ""drag-and-drop"" from windows. Then, three weeks after getting it, it just quit working. Froze up, won't get through even one song. Tech support still hasn't called back. After reading a few other reviews on this site, seems like a major problem with quality! I wouldn't buy one of these. WAY TOO FRAGILE for a mobile device."
1,Rave MP3,When I first got this MP3 player i was very pleased with its capabilities. But after a short while it began to stop playing in the middle of songs and froze alot. I wouldnt recommend getting this player becuase it freezes a lot and will stop through a playlist and return to the beginning of the playlist which causes you to have to go back through all of the songs again. I was disappointed in this product. I have only had it for about 3 months and it has already stopped working completely for me.
1,Rave ARC 5.0,This MP3 player is a waste of money. Before the first year was up it would not power up. The first unit was 200.00I paid 89.00 for another from Rave and 4 months later it locks up and won't play. They carry a 3 month warranty and would not help they wanted another 89.00.This product is poorly designed.
2,Bad battery - Even worse support,"I purchased the 2.5 ARC unfortunately. The battery was bad right out of the box - max of 2 hrs. I tried to purchase an after-market battery, but could not get the info from Support. I voided my warranty by opening the unit as well. I couldn't get anything from support. I offered to pay for a new battery - ""Can't be done. Can't buy it anywhere. Too bad."" I wrote Rave, Go-Video, managers, etc. Absolutely no responses from anyone. Good Luck if you buy from here."
2,Does not work with my series 7 display,I recommend the component video module instead of this for the TH-50PHD7. It didn't even show up as an input.
2,Maybe I need an eye exam,"I purchased this card to compliment the new Oppo DVD player recently purchased. The card arrived and installed quickly and easily. Strangely enough, while the picture is great, I honestly see no difference from the S Video picture. I have read others make the same remark on video forums so my experience is not unique evidently. But I imagined they couldn't possibly be correct so bought one anyway. I like having the DVI card but it seems like a waste of $150 plus. If you plan to buy one of these cards before they are gone completely, you might want to do some research first."
2,Flapper for toilet repair,"It is the same style like my toilet but, it wasn't the tightest fit. I would not recommend this product."
1,Does not work!,"Got the game shark plugged it up... did not work....misleading thought it was made by Nintendo....it's not! Called Nintendo and they warned me that they do not recommend the use of Game Shark, that it has fried a number of GBA's and has not been tested by Nintendo noris endorsed. Game Shark does not state on the package that it will not work w / color games, you have to open the package and THEN read thru, the directions to find this info out!! We tried Pokemon Gold and Nothing ....notta 40.00 is alott of $$.$$ for a product that does not work. We will try and get my money BACK"
4,Good product,"I have used this Gameshark for about a year now, and find it worth while. Yes, sometimes it is hard to download codes, but after they are downloaded the Gameshark works great.I recomend this Gameshark to anyone who wants help or to have a little fun on your Game Boy Advance."
1,Gameshark,"i hate gameshark! mine won't let me download any cheatcodes, and all of the codes are 16 letters or more, and my gameshark only lets me type 12 letters"
3,Lucky Chance,It looks like only a few selected Gamesharks work. If yours doesn't work you should get a refund straight away.
1,THEY SUCK,"Gameshark sucks thats all i got to say about there lame product, and now its even worst with thoses master codes of nearly 20 lines and on top of it the codes dont work and they freeze up your game."
2,Disappointed,"The description said it was a game shark, says nothing about being an Action Replay knock off, it does work, extremely touchy, not worth paying more than $20"
1,The Game shark is a shark,This game boy is a shark and by that I mean they take your money and then the product is faulty it only works somtimes for the first few times then the hardware breaks down the company has no information for trouble shooting. Dont buy this product unless you just want to be shark bait. DS
1,game shark stinks,i remember buying a game shark and then it was so complicated to download new stuff then when i saved it the entire library of codes got erased so i just said heck with this now i hear of an action replay id invest my money in that cause it sounds better but it kinda sounds like the same ballpark as the gameshark of course the gameshark i used was for gameboy color but still it shouldnt have erased the entire code vault from the thing true i never contacted customer support but still i wouldnt buy it cause i hear u cant even get help with the gameshark any more
5,AWESOME!!!!!,This is going to be awesome. You never have to write codes in again you just have to load the codes!!!!!!!
3,Few Bugs,"this cheating device may have a few bugs but it still works on some games. The thing is if you like pokemon then action replay is best for you but if you like other games then use gameshark. I brought this product about 1 week ago and it worked fine but when I put my pokemon game it didn't, although it didn't freeze or mess up the game it still didn't work. Then I went tot eh codejunkies.com website and downloaded the upgrade to make my GS a AR v3 and it worked perfectly. The thing that is really cool is that if you upgrade your gameshark to an AR it doesn't have all the bugs that AR has!!! WARNING: UPGRADING YOUR GS MAY CAUSE THE CODES TO BE DELETED. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK"
1,Even worse for European users,".I bought this on the promise of being able to download updated codes from the Gameshark.com website. This and many other features failed: 'Upgrade' feature fails, 'Search' feature fails on both pc interface and website, European codes not downloadable (unlike North American codes), and perhaps most frustrating of all, codes cannot be manually entered (b/c it's not possible to enter an uppercase letter character in the appropriate box in the pc interface!)I could live with the poor instruction manual, lack of installation or usage instructions (e.g. what are the top buttons for anyway?). But my failure to make the device work at all means it goes straight back to the shop."
2,Game shark is good for GBA but GBA only,"I got my Gameshark for the GB Advance system on 10-8-01 and tried out Castlevania Circle of the moon. Didn't work, checked the codes and compared them to the ones on the website and found out the master code was different, ok, so I changed that and it still did not work. I tried it with just 2 codes on, nothing.so I tried Mario Advance, didn't work either. The sharklink for the computer worked ok. that was the only thing I did not have a problem with. I called into support and they had me run through the same things I already did. I have to send it back in and have them send me a new one. It also wiped out my 4 game saves on Castlevania and 2 game saves on Mario. (not impressed)The other bad thing is that it is NOT Backwards compatible. So all of the gameboy color and gameboy games will not work with it.So hopefully the Gameshark will work correctly when I get it back."
1,"Important, READ","The gameshark DOESN'T work on any of the new games I try to enter it says ""unknown"" and they have no < customer support phone line thingy,it says the line has been cut off. DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY ON THIS STUPID PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!"
2,Bleh,"IT seems both action replay and gameshark have tons of bugs. i am hearing it shuts down, doesnt work, screws up the gameboy...Can i suggest something? DONT CHEAT! that is the fastest solution. The action replay's are generally very high quality so i would suggest getting one of those instead. the gamesharks features just dont always work, AND WHEN WILL THEY UPDATE THE SITE FOR cripes sake.."
1,Worst product ever made!,"I'm not a stupid person, but I find it impossible to get it to work. I have had the Gameshark for my GBA for 3 months. I have yet to be anything but infuriated by it. It is impossible to add/update games and game cheats, and has terrible support and website for codes. I have gotten to the final levels of the GBA games without any help from this piece of [junk]. Not worth it at any price. Do not waste your time or effort on this horrible thing."
1,I would buy all 8 if text to speach was enabled,I love Laurell K Hamilton. I try to get all of her books when they come out.... I would love to have her Meredith Gentry too.
1,I Don't know why I Bother,"I've read many books by this author in hopes I would enjoy some. But maybe I'm not into metaphysical this, metaphysical that. Every man in every book of hers has hair down to his ankles and boots with buckle up to his knees. These men are supposed to sound appealing ... not like women. I give up on this author."
4,Dodging Shadows,Merry Gentry is in hiding from the Unseelie Court on the west coast from friends and enemies alike. When she is outed as the missing Faerie Princess and finds that she must return to the Unseelie Court in Illinois. Merry is unsure of who she should trust after three long years away and it's definitely not her aunt or her cousin. The Queen's Darkness has now become her bodyguard along with the Queen's Killing Frost. The Queen of Air and Darkness that only Merry can provide for her by becoming co-heir with her cousin Cel. There have been three attempts to assassinate Merry since she landed in Illinois with a list of suspects and enemies a milelong. Merry must learn who she can trust and fast otherwise she might be dead. Who wants Merry dead? Can Merry dodge assassination attempts too? Will she find a Consort among the bodyguards? Can Merry's magic revive the Sithen and the Fey too? These questions and more are answered in A Kiss of Shadows.
1,Wow....this is bad,"Wow. I was really looking forward to reading something by Anita Blake as I heard so many great things about her books, but I could not even finish this book. (that is not common for me). I read over half of the book hoping that it would improve and it did not.This started off sounding pretty promising....a case that involved a dead man's wife and mistress (who are now friends). Quickly though, the case seems to be left behind. I found Meredith was having (mostly meaningless) sex with pretty much every male creature she encounterd. I like the supernatural type books, but some of the creatured were a bit over the top.Very disappointing. I did purchase the audio version of this book (I was pretty sure I would like it) and the reader was okay, but did not like the way she portrayed the male characters.I would not recommend this book."
4,Fair to middlin,"Pretty good stuff in here.. I was borderline 3 or 4 stars for this, so when in doubt, I will give the benefit... I like the Faerie princess who is displaced angle, and the palace intrigue and strange bedfellows can keep you guessing.Plus what guy wouldnt like to read about a woman who likes it a little rough ? Come on, the sex in this book is HOT, if sometimes a bit overblown. Sometimes even to the point of the sex scenes seeming like the sex in a slasher movie, in that they can detract from the story, rather than move the story forward."
4,i love Merry.,"i enjoyed this book so much,i read it again after i finished.true the plot is a little...iffy in places,but i didnt really notice."
2,Not worth the money.,"If you want to read a book about sexual escapades, this is the book for you. If you prefer a little plot with your books, pass on this one. Had this been the first Laurell Hamilton book that I had read, I would never have picked up another. The early Anita Blake books were excellent, however I think the writer has begun to believe that all we readers want are sex fantasies. That has made up more and more of her latest books. The action was always the best part, there really was none in this. This one was just pure trash."
4,Another excellent Hamilton novel,"I've read several of Ms. Hamilton's ""Anita Blake"" novels, but this excellent dark fantasy may be her best yet.A very sensual, exciting tale introducing Merry Gentry, a.k.a. Meredith NicEssus, a faerie princess of the Unseelie Court, where politics is a blood sport. For reasosn spelled out in the novel, Merry had to flee the court. She's been hiding out in California working as a private detective, until her old life catches up with her in some very interesting ways. Her aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness, wants her to return to the Court. Of course, up til now, Merry thought her aunt wanted to kill her - so what's going on now?You'll enjoy sifting through the various plot twists, the great characters, and a LOT of sensuality and sexual content. This one's not for the kids, folks.A bit different from the Anita Blake series, but great escapist fun."
1,trash,A friend gave me this book to read. Thank God I didn't buy it. This is a pornographic version of a penny dreadful. It seems to consist solely of sex scenes ( I cannot say erotic because that implies some degree of artistry)loosely strung together by an unfathomable plot centered around unlikeable characters. I could not finish-just gave up and threw it in the trash.
3,"A ""Faerie"" Confusing Book","Although I enjoyed this book, I found myself thoroughly bewildered at many points. What was badly needed was a guide to the kingdoms and creatures of faerie, their appearances, their powers, their lifestyles, etc. I am at sea about a lot of these things, particularly ""Seelie"" and ""Unseelie."" I also felt there were just too many characters, and I had a hard time keeping them straight. Some kind of reference would have been very helpful. And I'm not totally able to get involved with a character who enjoys pain with her sex. I may or may not read the next book, but I will definitely wait until it's out in paper."
3,Read with an open mind...,"It drives me crazy (in a BAD way) when people fall in love with an author, and then don't want them to grow beyond a single character or series. Laurell K. Hamilton proved herself to be the Queen of sexual tension in the Anita Blake series (I don't think there was any actual SEX until the 6th book)...but THIS book shows that she is in the running for Queen of fantasy erotica as well. And there is a LOT of sex in this book...perhaps too much. The character of Merry is a typical Hamilton heroine - petite, gorgeous and TOUGH! I would read another Merry book...even if I do have to wade through all that SEX!"
3,"Think Chocalate Bon Bon, Decadent but no real nutritional value","Racey Content, Pedstrian Writing Style still Enchanting (In Short)If explicit ""sex scenes"" are not your cup of tea this is NOT the book for you!With that said, although the prose style isn't really to my taste,the ideas,are quite engaging.The world the author builds is interesting and complex. I did feel there were a number of inconsistencies in the plot developement and the ""rules"" of the Fairy Kingdom...but that might be me confusing things....... The characters themselves I felt I grew to know and I wanted to Know them better ; )I like the juxtaposition of fantasy worlds and real life...but you have to be willing/able to suspend your disbelief to enjoy this...just like other fantasy novels...Elf lovers will probably be fans : )I will probably try Book number 2."
1,Talk About A Sellout!,"I've been reading Laurell K. Hamilton since the Nightseer book came out and I was in Middle School. I would buy the Anita Blake books the first day they were available at the book store and stay up until 5 am reading them. I love the writting style and the plots within both Nightseer and the Anita Blake books. This new series is a serious disappointment to me. It seemed as if sex was the focus of the book and plot and character development were thrown to the wayside. Everytime I thought the book was moving toward character development or ""gasp"" plot, more sex! This is nothing like I expected and I think that Ms. Hamilton could do a lot better. I realize that it's hard to stay creative with editors breathing down your back, but that's the way to keep an audience - stay true to your genre and don't sell out for a buck."
4,I'd love to live there-maybe...,"I am still waiting for some resolution for the first series--Anita, Jean-Luc and Richard. However, I have enjoyed Merry and Co in book form and even better, on audio cassette.The characters and story line are very engrossing. From the beginning to the end, I was guessing what would happen next. Her characters are wonderful, male and female alike. Very hot! Very engrossing. I enjoyed the audio so much that I'm glad I own it. Audio cassettes make hum-drum work so much easier. Listening to Merry's adventures makes housework, ironing, driving, etc so much more enjoyable. I hope there's a sequel soon!"
4,"Queens, Fairies, and Goblins, Oh My","I was a little confused in the beginning but it came together for me quickly. When I first started reading it I thought maybe I picked up a book in the middle of a series, like I had missed something. It was all part of the mystery that builds throughout the story. It left me wanting more, and luckily there are 7 books more for me. ;DThis book isn't appropriate for teens as it has entirely too much sexual content. I've learned that vampire and mystical books seem to be accompanied by a lot of sex. It's okay, but it's done very well for the most part in this book - nevertheless - explicit.Great story, I'll be fast reading her other works. I was so glad I read this on the Kindle because I could just download the next book!"
1,So Bad...,"Honestly this book was so bad that it holds a special honor in my life, it's the only book I ever actually threw in the trash.Sure it has erotica and no it's not on every page so I guess it's not ""filled"" with it...I'm not a prude to be bothered by erotica, heck I'm an artist who gets paid to do erotic images. It's just that in this case it seemed that the majority of the book is all filler around those portions where it seems she put the most of her effort."
3,A bit slow at first,I found the start of this book a bit of a drag to get through but once you got all the details of this very complex character out of the way things get interesting. The faire princess feel to this book is very adult. While I feel there could have been less erotic scenes in this book and more action it was still a good read.If you have read her Anita Blake vampire Hunter series be prepared to catch similarities between the two character's. This also takes a tone of writing that feels like some of the newest Anita books where there is a lot of erotica and less action.Overall it is a entertaining read but not my favorite.
3,Merry and Anita - same girl with different problems?,"The book was excellent as only LKH can do. I love her writing - always imaginative and with well developed characters. I was disappointed that Merry Gentry reminded me so much of Anita Blake. It was my hope that a strong female character could exhibit strengths that would differentiate her from others. Some details in the book also took me back to Anita - the discussion on how to draw, where a holster is best placed, the male characters seemed to be reflections of Jean Claude, et al, and other little details that I so enjoy in the Anita Blake books distracted me by appearing in a different story line. The book would have benefited greatly from an editor who could help strain out the Anita Blake similarities."
2,Talk About A Let Down,I had been eagerly awaiting the new series by Laurel K. Hamilton as her earlier releases with the Anita Blake character where spell-binding. I found myself turning page after page of her new release KISS OF SHADOWS hoping to come to some plot or purpose to the book. I was sorrly disappointed and felt that she introduced an assingnation plot that was a big flop--It went no where and left you wondering what was the point of the book. The book was also filled with reminants and reminders of Anita Blake melded into her new character Meridith Gentry not to mention the unbelievable even laughable non-plausable historical references. All in all I would say if your expecting anything close to Hamilton's earlier work don't bother reading KISS OF SHADOWS unless you enjoy big letdowns!!
2,Fair. Not what you usually expect.,"I thought Kiss of Shadows was going to be great. You had Merry, a Faerie Princess in hiding and as a detective. It was a great setup and had lots of potential for a great series with Merry on the run, working behind the scenes, trying to be a detective and not be detected....Too bad LKH threw it all away in one fell swoops, early in the book.The rest of the book was simply sex scene after sex scene. I was very disappointed."
4,Anita Blake is the most perfect woman ever dreamed of.,"I remember reading my first Anita Blake book by Laurel K. Hamilton so many years ago and thinking that Guilty Pleasures was one of the best books I had ever read, I have not been disappointed by the books that have followed. Anita Blake is everything I have ever wanted to be in a person and she lives in a world that is so unreal that you just want to be a part of it. There is about a 6mnth to a year between books and my only regret is that Laurel cannot put them out faster! This is one series that is sure to please no matter what you love: horror, romance, comedy, tragedy, science fiction and drama. This series has it all."
2,Disappointed,"This may be a problem with my expectations, but after reading the description of the plot I was really looking for a more tongue in cheek attitude in telling this story. The author really seems to take the whole plot too seriously and needs to infuse a little more humor to make the book work for me. I lost interest in the characters about half way through the book, and in the story shortly after that point. The sex scenes are fun, but not enough to carry the book."
3,where is the next one,"Kiss of shadows is the 2nd in the series. However, it ended with unanswered questions. Now it seems that at this time there is no ending in sight since there seems to be no 3rd book in the series. I would not recommend you start this one until the next in series is released or you will be left bbhanging there with unanswered questions (will Merry get pregnant? will she inhert the throne?)"
3,Could have done better,"I was really excited to be reading a new book by Hamilton. A new world a new plot! Cool!Evil wizard using unlawful magic, fairy in hiding, damsel in distress, orgers and brownies and pixies, Oh My!Then after a while I was beginning to wonder if there was really a plot and not just sex scene after sex scene after sex scene. I just started flipping over them hoping to find the storyline.Which seemed pretty rushed in the end, if you ask me. I couldn't tell if it was because these were new characters or what. But I think, and hope, the next book lets me learn to care about the characters.And not just their sex drives."
3,Sex and pale green men,"I found this book to be a disappointment. Don't misunderstand me having sex with pale green men with silver hair is naturally high on everyone's fantasy meter but page after page after page became a bit boring. Hamilton's alternative history theme is wonderful and I would have liked more of the lifestyle, the ways of the fey, etc. that she has given us in the Anita Blake series. I felt she was trying to prove how daring she was by her soft erotic approach, which was initially intriguing, but I missed her excellent plotting and storytelling. She seemed to be struggling to find the story between sexual romps. She can do better. Although one must admit her acceptance of all men regardless of appearance is cheerful."
1,"beware, this series degenerates quickly","Although the first book is intriguing, I had to give the series as a whole only one star. Each book was worse than the previous one, primarily because:(1) too many plot threads dangle forlornly(2) Those that she bothers to address are wrapped up too neatly, as an afterthought(3) The characters do things unexpected and out-of-character. If her Guards inspire such fear in Fairie, why are they so bad at it?(4) The middle books introduce so many characters Merry has sex with, I struggled to keep track of them all -- and then they inexplicably disappear(5) the last book (7 -- Darkness) is truly awful.I found these at my library, thank goodness... if you want to read them, be sure not to spend too much!"
2,Overdone,"Let me preface this with saying that I am a huge Laurell K Hamilton fan.In particular, this book took me three tries to start, and with force I finish it. It was difficult to keep track of all of the characters. The 468 pages were devoted mostly to lengthy descriptions about each characters clothes or body features.As a relatively recent reader of this genre, I found the whole Sidhe/Fey/Faere/Goblin/Brownie culture difficult to understand. Hamilton didn't provide enough information to help me separate each unique culture and then see their inter-relationships.I hope that Hamilton rescues my waivering trust and salvages the storyline in A Caress of Twilight."
3,Okay,"I know some people complained about the sexual context but that didn't bother me. After reading Anita Blake I can see where it would bother some people though. What bothered me was feeling like this must be the 2nd book in a new series because she never explains about how things operate. I would like a lot more background on the courts, the people who serve it, etc... You do get brief descriptions but did anyone else feel like that wasn't enough? I notice she does this quite a bit, never varying off the storyline to full you in on the background descriptions. With that said I did enjoy this book and I will be looking forward to the next book."
4,Well written but...,"I gave Kiss of Shadows 4 stars because it's still better than 80% of the books out there. However, Kiss of Shadows just seems to pick up where the last few books of the Anita Blake series where going: contrived sex scenes. Every situation/problem just seems like another excuse for some sort of sexual energy. That's the word that got stuck in my head while reading Kiss of Shadows and Caress of Twilight: contrived.Apparently, everything in the fey world can be solved with sex or the appearance of sex."
2,What a waste of time!,"I am so disappointed in this book! It seems the author wanted to write a book of erotica that could be sold to a wide audience. Nothing wrong with that, but it is not how the book is advertised. There is very little happening in this book in terms of coherent plot, it's all about sex with as many people as possible for our little Merry. It's obvious the plot is very much secondary, it doesn't matter to the author except as a thread to tie together all the S&M encounters. Again, nothing wrong with erotica, but label it what it is!"
2,bleh,"I have read all of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake stuff. I really enjoyed them, and I even re-read them when I'm low on reading material. In a moment of weakeness, I decided to give her Faery/detective tales a try. Oy veh, that's $6.50 I won't see again. Hell, that's lunch.Kiss of shadows was a combination of all the things I DON'T like about the later Anita Blake books. There's TOO much sex going on and not enough story line. There are interesting faeries, but they are all busy trying to get in each other's pants to really move the story along. First 40 pages is almost exactly like my least favorite part of ""Narcissis in Chains."" It's so purile and hormonal that it borders on a bad Romance novel. Frankly, if I wanted to read Romance/sex novels, I would, and not worry about the extras, like a plot. I expected so much out of Hamilton that the last few books have been so disappointing . I wish she'd get her mind off her hormones and get back to the storylines!"
1,Poorly written book,"This is a poorly written book with no apparent plot, just a series sexual escapades strung together. I do not plan to read any more books by this author."
5,Laurel K hamilton's best character yer!,"I have been a fan of Laurell Hamilton since I picked up her first book many years ago. I greatly admire her writing ability and imagination. And her daring as well, she is willing to confront unusual sexual issues in a genre where sexuality is more often a matter of hints and gestures.Hamilton's vampires are of the Anne Rice genre. They are beautiful, deadly and follow their own code of ethics. Merideth Gentry a princess of Faire...and a kick ass detective in the big city! Her friends and her enemies are literally of another world...but the whole series is sexy as hell.NightWatch"
4,Entertaining quick read,"I haven't read the Anita Blake series, so I can't really compare the two. Given that, I did like this book as an intro to the Merry Gentry (aka Meredith NicEssus) series. Sure there is lots of sex and fantastic looking guys. But this is escapism reading, not the novels you study and pick apart in a college literature course.My hardcopy and kindle collections are very eclectic (from Dickens, to Tolstoy, to Asimov, to Charlaine Harris and Tim Dorsey) so I am a pretty voracious reader. Sometimes you want to read the Russian classics and sometimes you just want to breeze through something fun and entertaining. A Kiss of Shadows is definitely easy, breezy (I read it in half a day). I look forward to reading the next one in the series."
3,I miss Anita.,"The book was good, but it was missing something. I enjoyed most of the characters other than the main one much more than I enjoyed Merry. Doyle, Frost... All of the men in this novel were much more interesting characters that I would love to get to know more about. Meryy, on the other hand, just seemed bland and flat. In fact all of the women in this novel seemed very colorless compared to the male characters.It is a good book to sit down and read on a rainy day when you don't have anything else to do. I enjoyed the read, but I would have prefered another Anita book."
3,I wanted to love it......,"I have been reading Laurell K. Hamilton for a couple of years now and am a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake series. I went out and purchased this new book hoping that it would be as good, but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it had it high points and it had it's not so great points, it just wasn't the ""stay up all night to finish it"" kind of book. I don't know if it is that I have been spoiled by the Anita Blake books or if that I just expected something different, but I guess you have to just take this one for what it is......the first in a series that needs some fine tuning and some deeper character development. I look forward to reading the next one to see how things evolve."
3,The erotic elements really weaken this book,"It's not that I'm prudish that the erotic elements of this novel annoy me-- they annoy me because they're irrelevant to the plot and don't add anything to the atmosphere of the book. If I want stroke fiction, there are other places to find that-- if I read a novel, I'm looking for elements that are interrelated.Merry Gentry is a faerie princess on the run, hiding in the mortal world pretending to be a mostly-human private investigator. All is well with the world until she takes the case of a woman being preyed upon by her ex-husband. Suddenly Merry's cover is blown and she's forced to deal with her loving family once again.Hamilton makes this concept of faerie more believable than you have a right to expect-- she's a slick writer and you won't have any complaints about the diction or style."
5,Better than the Anita Books,"Merry Gentry, the heroine of the first book in Laurell K Hamilton's new series is far more interesting than Anita Blake. Her intelligence and sense of compromise make her actions far more interesting than the often predictable Anita Blake.The Fey have taken on new life and their inhuman ambiguity give this book a cutting edge that had me racing through it in less than a day.My fears that this book would just be a rehash of Anitaverse books proved unfounded. This world seems to be even sharper and more vivid and has me waiting impatiently for the next one."
2,Merry Disappointment.,"The book is full of rich descriptions. Page long descriptions. However, if this book was a movie, by watching the trailer you would feel you have seen the whole thing. Reading the review gets you the story completely!After reading some reviews and Amazon recommending this book based on my liking of the Kushiel trilogy, I was eagerly waiting to read this book.I loved the Kushiel Trilogy. It has great characterization, and sex scenes (even some crude ones) that really add to the story. A Kiss of Shadows has shallow characters that are mostly interested in having sex. Again, if this book was a movie, it would be an adult film with some story in it to justify the sex, and not the saga I was expecting."
2,Dull Pornography,"The charactarization and plot are fine, so long as you don't mind that every developing scene is a sex scene. The story follows the formula of a standard smut romp and manages, stunningly, to do it without any heat.Is this what ""Bestseller"" has come to?"
5,Fantastical!,"Larell K. Hamilton has written books that I have not exactly been interested in because of Vampire's and such. However, I would now like to kick myself because she is a FANTASTIC writer. Although this book was not about vampires it was great. I love fairies and she depicted a perfect faerie society. The way she depicts and describes the characters and scenes are just beautiful. I am hooked and plan to read all of her books."
3,"Good intro, not much story","This started out as a pretty good detective novel then just gave that up and became a long winded description of Fairie royal court. Like the Anita Blake series, which I can't get enough of, Hamilton seems to use mysteries as background noise in teh story. Why even bother setting up a mystery if you aren't going to see it through. On the other hand, I admit I'm hooked. Hopefully the next one will be better."
3,"Derivative, but enjoyable.","I won't go into a plot summary, since others already have. I will say that, rightly or wrongly, I feel that Laurell Hamilton was very influenced by Mercedes Lackey (the Diana Tregarde series) and Emma Bull (War for the Oaks) -- okay, with some serious Anne Rice (her erotic ""Beauty"" trilogy) thrown in. But hey, this all works for me, since I loved all of the above. This book doesn't break any new ground, but it was certainly an enjoyable read."
2,Not my cup of mead,"Though many people like this book, I must conclude that it's not my thing. Laurell Hamilton promises a story of modern-day faeries and their complex court intrigue, which in theory is right up my alley, but I didn't really get into it.I agree with a previous reviewer who complains that ""every developing scene is a sex scene"". By about page 100, my significant other was laughing because I kept yelling aloud, ""Is she going to sleep with HIM TOO?"" The entire plot of the book seems to consist of Merry's sexual adventures. That would be OK if it were good erotica, but there is far too much gory violence to sustain the sexy mood. To sum up the book: Sex scene, gore scene, sex scene, gory sex scene...well, you get the picture.For urban faerie adventures with more plot, try Charles de Lint (Jack of Kinrowan), Emma Bull (War for the Oaks), James A. Hetley (The Summer Country), Diana Wynne Jones (Fire and Hemlock), or Nancy Springer (Fair Peril)."
5,Couldnt put it down...,"I am hopelessly hooked on Laurell K Hamilton. Every book that I pick up that she has written sucks me in and keeps me enthralled until the last page. I have read all of her Anita Blake books, but this was my first taste of The Merry Gentry series. Needless to say, it was very entertaining and action packed...things Ive come to expect from any Hamilton book. There was a bit of sexual overkill as well, but Hamilton does tend to go overboard in that area and I was not surprised or offended by it.The book oozed with a steady supply of unbearably hott men as Merry made her way from one adventure to the next...trust me, even though her life was constantly in danger, she was one lucky girl. All in all, this was a fabulous read. A definite keeper."
3,Laura loses her touch,"I'm a fan of the old Laurell K. Hamilton. That being said, I'm rather disappointed in A Kiss of Shadows. It seems as though one of my favorite authors is losing interest in ""fiction fantasy"" and taking interest in ""sexual fantasy"". There are a few fantasy elements here and there, but in the end, this is just another sex book."
1,A KISS OF SHADOWS,"This was the worse book that I have ever read. I had to force myself to finish the book. The book was boring, no plot & frankly I thought it was stupid. There was no pace or energy in the movement of the characters. The author spent two chapters on ""Merry"" walking down a path to see the ""Queen"". Unless you are a fan of Laurell Hamilton don't waste your time or money."
3,Disappointing...,"I really wanted to like this book... really. A fae princess in a modern day world outrunning her terrifying aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness? I was sold immediately. Unfortunately after trying very hard to get into it, the plot just isn't what I had thought it would be and so I have finally given up. I'm not a prude, I enjoy a little erotica in my books, but this is ridiculous. I felt like the main story was Merry's sexual indulgances and otherworldy beauty. That she was surrounded by a world full of interesting, mythical creatures mascarading in human skin and glamour, trying desperately to outrun her sidhe family and keep her friends out of danger in the meantime just got lost in the translation."
5,Sensual and fun,"Laurell Hamilton branches into a new forum with the faeries in ""Kiss of Shadows."" A sensual, exotic adventure that you wish you could take part in. I look forward to the next installment."
4,Good if you realize it is a fantasy,"The story doesn't follow the description of what the book is about. It actually follows Meredith's return to court and what that means to the politics there. It is interesting to find out how the dynamics have developed. The contest between Cel and Meredith is not introduced until the end, which leaves us something to look forward to in the sequel."
3,Perverse but entertaining,"This book was interesting, grotesque and entertaining. Avoid it if you dislike sex mixed with violence (though it's not vicious or misogynist like some thrillers). Some of the reviewers have rated this as though it were an Anita Blake vampire series novel -- it is not. It is the start of a new series. The author does a convincing job creating a picture of a very alien lifestyle, the Sidhe Court. The heroine, Princess Meredith, is gutsy and likeable. One reviewer was bothered by the promiscuity; I felt the sexuality was a legitimate aspect of alien culture. One criticism: the ending was very unresolved --too much ""wait for the sequel""! I enjoyed the book, but it's definitely among the ""guilty pleasures"" type."
3,Kiss of Shadows,"I enjoyed this book. I have been reading Laurel K. Hamilton since ""Nightseer"" great book by the way.This book is on a completely different scale than the Anita Blake series. Meredith Gentry is not anything like Anita Blake, except for the fact that they are both short women. In this book you get a more in depth perception of what the Fey are like. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys something just a little unusual. Enjoy!!!"
3,Very close to porn,"I was expecting some steamy lines, but this is pretty much porn all the way. If you don't mind that I guess it's not a bad book, although I didn't think the story was that strong. But I finished it and I didn't feel like it was a total waste of time, though I probably won't read any other books of this series."
5,Amazing Imagination,"Laurell K. Hamilton combines two worlds in her novel, ""Kiss of Shadows,"" the first in a series of books about a fariy princess. Her vivid storytelling takes you into a world full of hidden agendas and amazing occurances. This a wonderful book to pick up if you like science fiction and the fae."
2,An Okay Beginning,"Kiss of Shadows is entertaining enough in a lurid, trashy/gothic romance kind of way. However, I am of the distinct impression that Hamilton relies so heavily on physically describing the characters that she overlooked the actual ""character"" development. These people are quite shallow and unconvincing as thought bearing creatures. The plot is not really all that fabulous either. Even still, Kiss of Shadows is a good enough book to take on the bus or to your lunch break. Skip it if you want to sit down for some quality reading time. Get it if you want a quick, uninvolved read."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"Lately it seems like Hamilton's books (including Anita Blake) have just gotten to be sex, sex, sex. I got so bored with this that I just left it a quarterway through when I couldn't discern an interesting plot. Honestly, I'd rather just re-read Guilty Pleasures and remember a time when Ms. Hamilton's stuff was engaging and not just some soft-core porn with a supernatural twist."
3,Faerie Porn?,"If you're the kind of person who flipped through the Anita Blake novels looking for the sex scenes, you'll love A Kiss of Shadows. Nearly every chapter has steamy erotica scenes with gorgeous men and men-shaped creatures.If you liked the Anita Blake series for the action, the mystery, and the excitement of a tough girl getting by on grit and gunfire, you should look elsewhere.I loved the sex scenes in the Anita Blake novels, and felt they added a nice touch to the series. On the other hand, just because the chocolate chips are my favorite part of trail mix, doesn't mean I want a bag of only chocolate chips. My review? Too much sex, not enough plot and character development."
1,Stick with Anita Blake,I have read most of the Anita Blake series and I really enjoy them. That said I was very disappointed with this book. The character was poorly developed and the story weak. The whole farie world is very confusing to follow and Halmilton does not make much of an attempt to claify it in her writing.
1,A Kiss of Shadows doesn't measure up to LKH standards!,"I realize Hamilton is introducing a new alternate reality, a new batch of characters, and a new story line. However, A Kiss of Shadows was a total disappointment. There was virtually no plot, no character development, and no resolution to any of the situations presented within the story. The reader is immediately thrown into an intense sexual venue merely for shock value. If you make it beyond the first 200 pages, it gets truly boring. The book has the feel of Anne Rice or Stephen King writing about the Hatfields vs McCoys without the pleasure of their style. I'm very glad I borrowed the book and didn't pay money for it."
5,"Gorgeous shoe, wears well, not too high of a heel","I love this shoe for looks. It doesn't have a teetering type of heel, however, there isn't much holding the shoe on your foot, so you need to be careful. Further, I got the right size for my foot length, but the strap didn't stay on my heel that well. I didn't want to always be pulling it up (I was in a wedding wearing these shoes), so I got some heel grip stuff from Macy's shoe shop and put that all along the strap on the inside, to give additional padding and traction against my heel. That way, it stayed on."
4,Hot sandal,"Bought this shoe in coral for my daughter to wear for her prom. It is absolutely beautiful. If your foot is medium to wide, buy one half size bigger. My daughter says that the straps around her toes on her left foot began to get uncomfortable, but I suspect that wearing stockings would help this as well as walking around the house to break them in. I plan to get her some inserts so her foot doesn't slide too far forward. Amazon offers this shoe for the best price on the internet!"
3,JP-X Used to Possibly Lower (BUN) Level.,"Too early to tell; JP-X could be very good or non-effective. I need another blood test re: the (BUN) or [Blood Urea Nitrogen) level. I'll no more in a few months. If BUN level goes down at all, it will be a significant change and I will champion this product."
1,Que desilusión! El peor CD de Victor Manuelle,"Este CD es una gran decepcion. He seguido la carrera de Victor por muchos años; ademas tengo todos sus CDs y lo he visto en varios conciertos. Las canciones incluidas son las mismas versiones que en discos anteriores; nada nuevo. Posiblemente dos o tres son diferentes cuando mucho, pero no nuevas.Yo entiendo lo que Victor queria hacer con su disco, pero creo que seria mejor si lo hubiera hecho con diferentes arreglos o con diferentes artistas. Fue como si yo hubiera seleccionado en iTunes una lista de sus baladas y venderlas. Creo que lo mejor seria que vendiera el disco a $5 en vez del precio normal de US$14.00. Nos quedó mucho a deber."
4,Nice Necklace however stone is a little dark,The necklace is great and she loves it. The only gripe I have is that the stone is extremely dark colored and I would have liked a more vibrant sapphire blue at least more blue such as the online picture depicts; other than that the necklace is great.

4,Handy guide,Is used by the professional motion picture industry and has a lot of useful information. Has also been used in classes that teach about motion pictures
5,Not just a dull technical book . . . very interesting . . .,"I am an aspiring D.P., interested in lighting and camera operation. This book gives a good insight to the relationship between D.P. and director. It does not give dull ""how to set up lights,"" but provides some interesting information provided by some outstanding cinematographers, many are members of ASC. I found it to be an excellent read."
1,Not Useful for someone new to lighting,"If you are looking for a good, instructional book on lighting setups and techniques...keep looking. This book may be useful to a seasoned director or gaffer, but is rather useless for beginners. This is essentially a book on interviews, and while has some techniques discussed throughout, is not presented in a way that would be useful for someone hoping to learn the finer details of lighting."
3,Semi-Satisfaction,"The functionality of the clips with regards to holding a flag is adequate. However, the clips will slide up and down the light standard at will without some added clamp to hold them in place. Even with them tightened as tight as they will allow, running at cruising speed, the holders move and cause the flag to skew. I may not recommend them for the future."
2,Clips unsatisfactory.,These clips do not fit tight enough on the flag pole. As a result the two clips do not stay apart causing the flag to bunch up.
2,"Beautiful story, ugly binding...","My daughter fell in love with this book after checking it out at the library. The version she read was a beautiful picture book with pages and pictures as wonderful as the story. She had earned a treat and only wanted this book.Let me just say how disappointing it is to open a box and find a small, flimsy paperback with not one, single picture! The cover pictured is the actual book cover and inside is small type covering pages with small margins. Only half of the pages are even printed; the book ends just over half-way through the pages of the book.This is a beautiful story, and I realize that this is a rare publication, but it is still a letdown to find such a book especially at this price."
1,Warning Rip Off,"Warning! This CD was obviously homemade. It had only one track. Horrible to pay and wait for delivery and it's a homemade CD, not from the publisher and doesn't even work! I have returned this item and was never refunded my money. I have not purchased anything from Amazon since. What about copyright law violation for selling homemade CDs? I've signed up for [...] for all my book listening. I don't trust Amazon anymore. Trust me, if I owed Amazon money, it would be on my credit report!"
4,FOR RIO LOVERS A MUST!!!,This album is an excellent addition to any prog rock collection. Samla Mammas Manna is probably one of the most original and innovative bands in Rock-in-opposition genre. This album combines folk and jazz with rock in a very balanced way.Highly recommended for anyone who listens to progressive rock!!!Good progressions!
5,Klossa Knapitatet,"Enough clowning here too, the very first track, excellent overall, ends with a choir of drunken Vikings. The next one, Liten, is a great art-rock piece. Sucken is a nice little intermission featuring a good guitar and piano and Lang Ner is a (well played) mix of folkish tunes. Track 6 (the long word) is a fine thing and Influenser is an interesting composition (exclusive of the rooster battle cries in the middle of it), reminds of Yes' Fish. The last track is a mix of avant-garde and folk, very good guitar."
4,Need to know as progresive fan,"a pice of art, a big mixure or ideas, folk, circus music, ideas, ideas, ideasnot the english melodiesnor either the dramatic italiansthere is not hard undergrown distortiones american voicesthis is a complex, ingenuity, art and incredible and magical combination of ideasprogresive rok at his best, great piano and simple drums"
4,Well Made Product,"I bought this part because I needed a new ball joint it is a very well built product I was impressed especially after hearing the reputation of MOOG products. I was not disappointed with the company I bought it from either, quick prompt delivery."
4,Nice - if incomplete - introduction,"This is both a fairly decent introduction to an early phase of the Cocteau Twins' fifteen years long career, *and* a must have for completists: Millimillenary - allegedly their first song recorded festuring Simon Raymonde on bass - and the Wax and Wane remix are unique to this release.This is certainly not a complete overview of their work up to that time, and I would personally recommend to get ""Head over Heels"" or ""Treasure"" first.I am sorry to disagree with somebody who shares a great part of my musical tastes - and who granted this compilation four stars as well - but I have to say that ""Musette and Drums"" is one of my favourite tracks from ""Head over Heels"", if not my favourite Cocteau track ever. Oh, well, different strokes for different people."
5,Great Little Set of Speakers!,"For a small speaker system, the quality of sound is exceptional. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a speaker system for an iPod nano or regular iPod. The remote control has features to change the treble and bass. It's very easy to set up and play.Even at a low volume, the sound is exceptional.Only drawback... you cannot control the speakers without the remote control."
1,Extremely disappointed...item didn't work and seller failed to respond to my emailed....I was taken!!,"This product never worked....period. Further, no one returned an email after I attempted to get a replacement. I am totally disappointed and felt really used."
4,Good information for living in the real world,"Author is dead-on accurate, as I have tested her stuff on many faces already. Worth the read, even though the book is long-winded. She could have given the necessary information in half as many pages. I also think there is more info out there that she could have included in the book. For example, regarding teeth, she only talks about the two front teeth & the canines. She fails to cover the meaning of crooked vs. straight teeth. (I have been told that crooked bottom teeth means that a person has trouble making decisions.)"
2,Another cover it all manual for a do-it-yourselfer,"This book tries to cover every aspect of building a house instead of focusing on the details that are particular to building with adobe. I would have prefered the author refer me to other books and reference material for surveying, electrical, plumbing, etc. It is impossible for anyone to do a thorough coverage of all aspects of building so why try."
5,Works grate,I should have bought one of these years ago. So much easier to use than the old four sided grater. I thought it would be difficult to clean but even cheddar rinses off with hot water.
5,Perfect for zesting,This tool is perfect for zesting citrus peel. It really makes the task a cinch. But be careful if you use it to grate things. Some cheeses got jammed in the tiny holes.
4,Better than Microplane,"Definitely better than Microplane in its shape (slightly rounded) and its sharpness (hide your knuckles). Also love the fact that the end you place on the counter/cutting board is rubber coated to prevent slippage. Only drawback is the plastic handle: it's too short (and I have little hands!), and the plastic is cheezy and uncomfortable. A lot of my utensils are Good Grips, and you really come to rely on and appreciate the heft, girth and comfort of their handles."
2,Not as good as I thought,"This product is okay, but it lacks a collection device on it, so stuff can get all over the place if you're not careful. The quality is good but not quite what you'd expect from the picture. Price was wonderful, but I'd recommend paying a few bucks more for something better."
1,Cuisipro Zester,I do not recommend this zester. I found the blades to be dull and difficult to use. I have other zesters that work great and by comparison this one is a no go!
5,Great Grater,"I love this grater/zester. Use it almost everyday, mostly for grating cheese. Everyone should have one in their kitchen drawer."
5,a favorite,Easily one of the best utensils in my kitchen. Goes through cheese like butter and shreds it very thin and light -- perfect for over pasta or soups. Also zests great but watch yourself as it is easy to get overzealous with this because it's so smooth. I use it on such a constant basis now that I have a hard time figuring out how I made it so long without this. Worth three times what I paid for it.
5,"Wow, this zester makes me feel like a pro",I have never tried a grater/zester before but I love ginger in many of my marinades and wanted to use it fresh. This little contraption works great. No more grating my fingers and it grates the pieces to just the right size. Super for the price.
5,GREAT Grater/Zester,"I bought this as a zester, but I use it all the time for cheese - heaps of cheese just fall on to or into whatever you need cheese in. I used it recently for the ginger I keep frozen and it went through the frozen ginger no problem and made a nifty fluffy little pile of ginger (which I used in my tea pot). I have yet to use it for zesting - but gave it as a gift to a budding chef who zests with it all the time, he says it's GREAT! If it dulls after a year, for this price, I'll just buy another. Buy this with confidence."
2,Well made except...,"I have two problems with this thing:1. The grating blades are at an angle that causes the food to want to slide to that side...then the fingers get grated. A little practice avoids that though.2. It doesn't come with any kind of plastic cover so, like, where do you store it to prevent damage to it or your hands? Next time I'll get something with some sort of snap-on cover. I would have gladly paid another buck to have it."
3,This book is printed on demand. It's not really in book format.,"This book is printed after you order it. The only copyright you see is the date it was recently printed. I would have liked to see the year the book was published (1910). The font is clear and easy to read. It takes time to adjust to the page format, however. The pages are wider than is comfortable for the eye. They are almost as large as pages of a textbook. I would not buy a book in this format again. Amazon should have mentioned that this is not in actual book format."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this lamp when it was $175.00. While awaiting it, the online price was raised to over $300.00. After waiting for over three weeks before I received it, in hindsight, I should have cancelled the order because of continual delays. When it arrived, the base was scratched, and now only after having it for only a month, the finish is cracking and falling off. The quality is very cheap, and the description is misleading, as is definitely the price. I now would not even pay $100.00 for this lamp. If you want quality, of which you should for this new outrageous price, look and purchase a different lamp. It's definitely not worth it!"
3,"Made in China, and it shows.","Very heavy lamp, but with really horrible finish. First one was scratched and then varnished and clear-coated over the scratch. Second one was just as bad, with scratches on the stem of the lamp, and a dented lampshade, with the sewn trim sewn crooked. So much styrafoam crushed into little pieces, it took forever to clean the lamp and dust up the styrafoam. Came directly from China, and it shows. Wish they still made quality lamps in America."
5,Outstanding Read,"I read First Day Jitters on the night before the first day of third grade. This book is about Sarah Jane Hartwell. She did not want to go to school on the first day. She said her head hurts and didn't feel well to try to get away from going to school. Mr. Hartwell tries to encourage her by saying, ""Of course you're going, honey...as he walked to the window and snapped the shade. This book made me feel excited for the first day of school. I like this book because it is very funny. Look for the surprise ending. I would recommend this book for children from ages 5-10."
5,Super book for preschoolers and kindergarteners!,"Julie Danneberg's ""First Day Jitters"" ought to be mandatory reading for all preschoolers and kindergarteners before they go off to school the first day. Sarah Jane Hartwell is snuggled down tightly under her covers, not wanting to go to her new school, while Mr. Hartwell urges and cajoles her into moving along. Mr. Hartwell drives her to school, where the principal, Mrs. Burton, kindly meets Sarah Jane at the car and personally escorts her into the classroom. And on the last page is a wonderful surprise that is guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any young child who's concerned about that all-important first day!Judy Love's vivid ink and watercolor drawings have a great sense of movement and are pleasingly colorful. She does an especially fine job of hinting at the surprise to come on the last page without giving it away via the illustrations."
5,Great book for making connections,The kids were so surprised by the ending and it helped them understand that their first day of school feelings were normal - even the teacher has them! :)
5,new school,Bought this book for my grandchild who was transferring from a private school to public school. This funny story helped ease her mind about the change.
5,Great for Middle/High School Kids Too!!,I was so impressed with this book and its ending that I am going to read it to my 8th graders this year on the first day of school. ALL students like to be read to - even the older ones. I teach math and science but we still take time to read and write every single day (and usually NOT about math or science!). The wonderfully colorful and engaging illustrations don't give away the ending before the last page! Highly recommended!
5,My 4 1/2 year old's new favorite book!,"My son loved this book the first time I read it; he just finished his 1st year of pre-school and since he's an only child, he had a challenging time getting used to school and lots of kids all in one room! They changed the location of his school starting in the fall, so this was a timely book, as he won't be in the same building, and many of his new friends will be going elsewhere, thus he will have to look at new faces once again. This book has a great ending that made us laugh. I recommend the book highly."
5,Great Teaching Tool...,I am a preschool teacher and I read this book to my class the week of our Preschool Graduation Ceremony. We were discussing our fears about starting Kindergarten and they absolutely LOVED this book! They were shocked to learn that it was the teacher who was afraid of the first day of school! This is a wonderful teaching tool to help preschoolers prepare for their first day of Kindergarten!
4,Shipped quickly and was in good condition,The dvd shipped quickly and was in good condition. No problems with the dvd!
4,"Good sound, weird battery operation, works with nano chromatic","The product is great and sounds really good. Only complaint I have is that when batteries are connected, you can't plug it into the wall at the same time and it won't charge your ipod. I tested how long you can run it off fully charged NiMH AA batteries and got 3 hours out of it so far but the batteries are not drained so definately good for the beach now that spring and summer are around the corner."
4,happy camper,"So the first one sent to me didn't work so well. But, Emily called and wanted to make things right. Sent out another Dock station right away and this one works perfect."
2,"OK, but cheaply made, and now broken.","A gift for my 11-year-old, this was broken within 4 months, and he really is fairly careful with his things. There is not support behind the iPod as it sits on the dock, so the charger/connector is now broken. I just e-mailed them asking for a refund.The sound quality is what you would expect for 39 bucks. It sounds like music, but hard to listen to for very long due to tiny speakers.For an adult who just wanted a charger with speakers on your desk or something, I would recommend this as long as you're not much of an audiophile."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I got this speaker set 4 months ago. I figured, most iPod accessories are way overpriced, finally here's one that isn't. I have a small room, so I knew it wouldn't have to get very loud, and I thought it would be adequate for that.It wasn't. There is virtually no bass response at all, and even from day one higher frequencies produced a noticeable buzz. I was replaced a similar looking Bose sound dock that was about 4 years old and had gotten pretty beat up, and the sound quality was drastically better on the Bose (granted, the Bose was $[...] when I got, but Satechi wasn't an option).Beyond that, the other day it stopped producing and sound at all. It still powers on and responds to the remote, but I get no sound output at all.Save yourself the trouble. If you like music, don't buy these speakers. They are equivalent to listening to music through laptop speakers, and apparently not well built at all."
5,GREAT DOCK!,"the satechi round speaker touch dock has great sound, and for our small home, very compact.my daughter loves it and i love her not falling asleep with ear buds in!great product, swiftly shipped!"
2,Bad design,Remote does not work. Volume control requires you to hold two buttons at once. Sound quality is poor.
4,Is okay.,"Is okay for in-home background music while a dinner party finds its way to a generally pleasant conclusion. This device is a perfectly fine way to play an iPod so every guest can admire your musical taste and venturesome attitude. Great sound system? Please rein in unrealistic expectations. It's a couple of plastic disks with grills. It's good for the modest task at hand. You would, for instance, amaze the guy in the airplane seat next to you."
5,iPod Dock Station,Ordered and received a Satechi iCraft Dock Station Stero Round Speaker for a new iPod.Nice compact design and very good sound. Remote Control is a nice feature and easy to use.
3,It was great at first...,"I ordered this item in December. It's now the end of February and I'm starting to get a loud humming noise. It's not happening frequently yet, but I have a feeling it may. The humming is louder than I can keep the volume while I am at work. On a daily basis the iPod seems to randomly unplug itself and stops playing. Also, since I started using the docking station, my iPod no longer keeps track of the song count... not too happy about that.Otherwise, the sound quality has been great. I don't have to use the remote so I cannot comment on the function of that.6/13/12 UPDATE: The images on this page ARE NOT of the docking station I have, why is it okay for these people to change the product and not create a new product page for it? Causes the reviews to be pretty misleading."
1,Not compatible with newer ipods! Not a good dock!,"This dock is a terrible buy. The sound quality is decent at best, the remote doesn't control the functions of the ipod, and the batteries must be taken out of the speakers when it is plugged into a socket. In addition, the connecter port doesn't connect easily, and you have to really jam the ipod down to get the sound to come out of the speakers. I'm pissed that I bought this, and I'm going to look into getting a refund."
3,Review Product for Satachi iCraft Dock Station Stereo Round Speaker Made for iPhone 4,"I have received this item on March 3, 2011 or sooner than expected which is informed on the order details on the website amazon.com. Regarding satisfaction with this product, in principle, this device has a good quality product if used in a narrow work space only. However, the reality is less product advertisements describe the condition of reality that is in advertising this product has a very clear voice with great sound intensity. Supposedly, the product advertising should be adapted to the reality of real goods.Regards,Sapto PHSJakarta - Indonesia"
1,Piece of crud,"I bought this looking for a basic speaker and dock for my iPhone. This product got decent reviews and I wasn't looking for great sound, just something that worked. Well, from the beginning it never charged my iPhone 4. I found this out while on a trip out of the country, for which I had specifically bought the speakers. Plus it automatically played whenever I plugged in my phone, so not only wasn't it charging but it was draining my battery every time I tried to get it to work. This was a disaster and I ended up having to rig something just to charge my phone.I contacted Satechi by email, but never heard back--completely useless. Plus, it was back ordered and while I was waiting the price went up. So don't be fooled by the price they display here. You might end up paying 2/3 more. This whole thing stunk to high heaven and I would advise you to stay far away from this product."
5,Great Seller,I ordered this product during the busiest time of the year and they still made it prior to Christmas. It is a great product that sounds amazing considering what I had to pay!! Great product & great seller!
5,"Great product, great customer service","THE PRODUCT - I was looking for a middle of the road iPod speaker because I wasn't interested in paying $200 for a BOSE iPod speaker. I wanted something small, simple and reasonably priced. THIS IS IT! Don't expect BOSE quality sound, but it is more than adequate for a desktop speaker in an office or to make your 1st gen iPod touch a great alarm clock (which it has inside it, but no built in external speakers to make it useful) Also, this dock is a great way to charge the touch, which does not come with a wall charging adapter.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE - The only glitch in my experience was that the speaker/dock did not come with a universal iPod touch adapter. Your iPod will still attach to the speaker and work fine, and for the most part sit on the dock solidly. But the adapter makes it much more solid. I e-mailed Satechi and asked for an adapter. They CALLED me back, that's right CALLED me back, and offered to send one out free of charge. THAT'S an A+ in my book."
1,Don't buy this,"Really, don't buy this piece of crap.Here's why I hate it:The dock connector is very short. So you can't use it, if you have a bumper case in your iPhone. You have to take it of, which is very bothersome if you use it everyday.The sound is very muffled.It doesn't have any volume control.It has a light that turns on automatically when you connect, but doensn't turn off automatically when you disconnect. If you use it in your bedside table, you have to connect the phone, then turn off the light. Everyday.I also bought a Philips Fidelio, that is cheaper, has it's own controlling app (which is very good) and has a much better sound."
2,Disappointed,"I had hoped I found the right speakers for my iPod Touch, but this device was not it. The sound quality was very poor, and the remote worked if I was standing at the device. I sent it back very quickly."
1,Terrible sound,The sound coming through this dock station sounds so tinny. I would not recommend this to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,"Nice design, poor sound quality","The product has a nice design and good price, but the sound quality is poor, equivalent to one of those small stereo systems you had as a kid in middle school."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't expect such a good sound from something so small! I use it at work and it keeps me going all day! For the size and the price, I was pleasantly surprised!! Well done!!"
1,crap!,"The first one I got did not work, so I ship it back at my expense and was given another and that one did not work so know I have to ship it back again... do You see the pattern here people!"
3,Not Bad,I would say this product is not bad but not wonderful. The only problem I have found so far is that the remote is very sensitive. The remote barely works so I find myself not even using it because I don't have the patience to take 5 minutes or longer to turn up the volume or change the song. The sound quality is decent for the size.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this item in order to be able to listen to my ipod and recharge it while on travel. Although the size is great and it fits in my briefcase, the sound is not what I hoped for. I recently purchased a set of Altec Lansing speakers and docking stationAltec Lansing T612 Digital Speaker for iPod and iPhone (Black)for $119 which sound great around the house, but are too big to take on the road. This round speaker by Satechi has very poor sound in my opinion. When there is nothing else to compare it to (like when I am in a hotel room) it is tolerable, but when home it does not hold a candle to even my ihome clock radio. When playing music or listening to a podcast, it doesn't sound like the same recording. I would not buy this again and would have returned it if I bought it locally. I would be willing to spend more for something that sounds better and is portable. Satachi did ship it quickly though, hence the extra star."
5,great portable speaker system,it does all as advertised; and the vendor/manufacturer was very prompt in processing my order. i would definitely do business with this vendor again!
4,I like this,"I wanted a clock radio and put that on my search bar, this item came up..... I thought it was clock which it is not."
3,Teen Slasher...With Dolls,"Doll Graveyard is a decent Full Moon offering, not quite as good as Full Moon's Demonic Toys or Puppet Master. But it is better than all of the sequels to those two classics. It's got a few funny scenes, courtesy of the douchebag character named Ritchie. And it has some good gore on display. This is really like a teen slasher film, only with dolls doing the killing instead of a homicidal maniac. See it if you're a Full Moon fan or a fan of killer doll flicks."
2,Will not install or even start,"I used to love this game as a kid and bought the newest version. When I got it I installed it immediatley and once installed I tried to play it and nothing happened. So I tried two other computers I have and the install button would come up and nothing happened after that. Very dissapointing. I also tried the the patches online to fix it for Xp and still nothing. Even though the game sucked the seller was very helpful. It might work for Windows 95/98. THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK FOR XP, SO IF YOU HAVE XP DONT BUY IT.SIM Theme Park (Gold Edition)"
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,We bought this because it said it would work on Windows XP - it does not - so do not buy this if that is your expectation
5,All of Enya's cds inspire vivid imaginations and aspirations,"In a quiet space, listening to her music can make one aspire to dream and dream away."
5,Classic Shearing....absolutely wonderful !,"This is classic George Shearing. Beautiful old songs, played as smooth and lovingly as moonlight shining through the wine...."
3,A Mixed Review,"I tried this game out awhile back, and even though I was impressed with the overall look of the game, and enjoyed the catchy music and crazy sound effects, I have to put down the control-ability. I could not keep all of the controls in line, there was too many of them! Plus, it didn't help that the opponents are VERY hard, even on the easiest setting (I never got past 3rd on any given track), so while you're struggling with the fact that you don't have 7 fingers on each hand, you're getting continuously pummeled by the other drivers. The only mode worth playing is time trial and that gets old really fast!"
4,I fine movie well worth your time,"Oh boy this movie had me squirming in my seat as it covers some not so fun family issues and the age old keep your hands off your brothers girl dude. Our main man Caleb (Adam Scott) is a man in need of a friend or someone who could just shake him and tell him to snap out of it boy. Caleb falls for the wrong girl despite his better judgement, some of us can relate I am sure. Adam Scott who plays Caleb is a great actor in my book and really makes this movie work. I fine movie well worth your time."
4,"Great acting, directing","Impressive performances by Adam Scott, Brittany Snow, and JK Simmons, and Alex Frost, who seems not to have been in much else, was good in his less nuanced role. I particularly liked seeing Scott and Simmons in dramatic roles, since I have previously only seen them in comedies.Complex subject. At times I definitely questioned the message about women, but by the end of the movie, it's clear that all of these ""betrayers"" are equally flawed. Both the acting and great directing made for a movie that struck me as emotionally deep, and also intellectually stimulating. Somewhat depressing yes, but I enjoyed it and didn't come away feeling depressed. Just emotionally moved to a certain degree, and impressed by the acting and directing."
4,So glad I stumbled across this gem,"I am a writer and have much respect for fellow writers. Lee Toland Krieger not only wrote this but directed and produced as well; something I wish to do in the future. To have complete creative control over an idea makes my soul smile. I was flipping through channels and ran across this movie and decided to give it shot. It was incredible. The acting...Adam Scott, whom I affectionately call Derrick (lol his character in Stepbrothers was classic) had me on edge the entire movie. J.K. Simmons (he played the dad in Juno and Schillinger in Oz) was really good too...the entire cast did their thing. This was a really good movie, good enough to buy and I definitely don't buy movies anymore in this recession.The Vicious KindFat Kills"
4,The Vicicus Kind,"I think this is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time, Adam Scott is one find actor, and Brittany Snow just proved she is up there with the best of them. Alex Frost & J.K. Simmons are the best co-stars in a romantic comedy I have ever seen.... J.K. Simmons he can do anything, He made me bust -a -gut..I laughed so hard."
1,"Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest","Five hours of three pseudo-intellectuals sitting around carrying on a conversation with each other, none of whom have even the slightest clue what the other one is talking about. Unintentionally funny and boring at the same time, it makes a great party flick or gag gift idea for your snooty, cerebral friends. Don't worry about the five hour length, as the challenge is to see who can stand to view it beyond even the first hour. But it is filmed in color!"
4,Crazy movie with great cinematography,"This is a really cool indie film out of Canada. I had the chance to watch it at a film festival screening not too long ago.It is a dark film, with many twists and turns before the big payoff. The acting is solid and the cinematography & sound editing work very well together in creating a nicely stylized look and feel."
3,A little boring,"I read this quite quickly. The story is rather weak and his characterization of the wife is annoying. The story takes too long to get going and then it's half-over. It is not extremely satisfying or interesting, and doesn't really make too much sense. I recommend Saberhagen's Empire of the East or perhaps some of his other (many) books."
4,Starts nice but get ready...,The learning curve is huge but worth the climb. The prospects are endless so expect to get lost in this program as with so many others of it's ilk. I would suggest investigating all of the possibilities when it comes to educational software-videos as well....Michael Stone
1,it doesnt suck.,this product doesnt vaccum out the air I was disappointed with it but i guess you get what you pay for
1,"Poor ""Vacuum Sealer""","Much like the other commenters I've found this device just doesn't work well as a vacuum sealer. The bags tend to suck air back in over time. Works great as a cheap impulse sealer, I often use it to reseal chip bags. But for backpackers looking for water tight seals on their vacuum packed food -- don't bother. I've had this about 3 or 4 years now and am not impressed :S"
1,Totally a waste of $$$,"I bought 1 for $29.99 & it is totally a waste of $$$. It somehow evacuates the air out but the sealer does not keep the air out, or should I say, does not seal at all. I have had it for 2+ years now and cannot believe it is still for sale."
1,vac your cash,I did think this was a great buy . but it does one thing great suck your cash out!I was very unhappy when I tried this brand only because my old seal a meal bet the dust and after having a real vac this was a big let down!!
1,Recipes for Wallpaper,"If you design wallpaper or stove grills or rugs or dinnerware patterns, this book might help you. The writer never bridges the gap between Notan and art. And I don't care what anyone says, there is absolutely nothing interesting about a misshapen abstract version of a pair of scissors. And primative indian art is fine for what it is but attempts to glamorize it to be something it is not is totally unnecessary. This kind of illusion in design was interesting for about 5 minutes back in the 60's and 70's. If there is any value in this book, it's really well hidden. If you want a good book for ideas on composition, I recommend you keep looking."
1,Caused vomiting,"The first time I gave my cat the treats (just shy of 1 year old, seemed to have an iron stomach) he was fine. The 2nd time, he vomited one time shortly afterwards. At this point, I didn't put together that it was the treats, we have two little kids and I berated them for feeding the cat something he shouldn't be eating. Third time, I knew the kids hadn't given him anything and he vomited almost immediately and continued to vomit until all he had left was bile. I see the pattern now. NOTHING else has made him sick.If you check the reviews for this product, but the hairball control variety, you will see NUMEROUS reports of cats getting sick. In to the trash they go.Cat will be 1 year old on Feb. 29th (yes, leap year, so we will count Feb. 28th instead) Snowshoe/Manx mix, being fed Blue Wilderness Evolutionary Diet Indoor dry and canned. We have no other instances of him getting sick. ONLY in direct connection with these treats."
4,Cats Like It,"They are a little picky, but they like it and we live in Asia and these are not available on base."
5,Lovely,Lovely product. Purchased something else from the line on QVC but wanted this. Happy to find it. Smooth purchase.
4,Solaris,"In a recent interview, Stanislaw Lem said he was disappointed that Soderbergh's update brought the love story to the forefront. Agreed, but the movie clocks in at half the length of Tarkovsky's, so naturally many of the philosophical threads can't be addressed. Lem, like many other writers in similar situations, needs to stop thinking of his novel as the sacred scripture from which the adapting artist should not deviate. He should understand that hacking a text to pieces, selling it for spare parts, junking what doesn't fit, reassembling it--this is high praise. Soderbergh does a great job with the story, and with the camera (as usual, though he was coming off of ""Full Frontal"" which has my vote for the worst movie of the last 10 or 15 years), and the performances are all fantastic as well. I don't believe there is as much sacrificed in this 90-minute version as Lem would have us believe. It's still a deeply thought-provoking story."
3,Hmmmm....,"This is one of those films that has it's share of problems but if you're in the right mindset you really might enjoy it. It is a mood piece to be sure. Not even so much a science fiction movie (it's really a thought provoking love story), and it has Clooney's best performance since Three Kings. I loved the look, sound and acting in this film. And more importantly I appreciated what I think Soderbergh was trying to do with the film. Personally I think it's better than the original. The original may have had more going on with the characters but it is really slow in spots whereas I think the pacing in this one is surprisingly strong. This is not a movie for everyone and it is not a science fiction film. If you can handle that aspect about it then I think you will like it. It works better as a ""weird"" love story."
3,Why bother with a remake,"Why would anyone want to remake Tarkovsky's masterpiece?Maybe it was Cameron's idea - his remake of 'A Night to Remember' was fairly well received, despite the extraneous love story. Although I suspect it was saved by its special effects.The original Solaris was glacially paced, mysterious and atmospheric.The remake is slow, irritating and derivative.Buy the original, rent this one and make your own comparison."
3,Difficult to rate,"I'm really not sure if I love or hate this film. It begins with a sort of Alien or Outlands feel to it, i.e. that there is an unknown force on a space station that is killing and/or causing people to go mad. The tension builds as the source of the madness is exposed but then the story flatlines. Love and loss are the primary themes. Solaris is not an action/adventure movie. Space is merely the setting for a love story that is something of a cross between Ghost and What Dreams May Come.Every once in awhile, a work like this simply baffles me. I don't know whether to recommend it or tell others to avoid it. I can say that I would never buy and will certainly never watch it a second time, but I got something positive out of it that I cannot quite describe."
2,Slow and Boring,"The only reason I don't give this film one star is the performance of Viola Davis. She is the only one in the cast that seems to care if the audience is awake or not. However , the slowing moving screenplay also does'nt help..Save your money and see it on cable.."
2,A BOY A GIRL AND A PLANET,"Natascha McElhone may be a fine actress but her 'who am I, where am I?' portrayal of a deceased woman materializing in outer space lacks much conviction of whatever the film is trying to convince us of. There are moments of intense drama here; George Clooney blankly staring at a torn jagged hole in the spaceship wall, but there is also a dreary unsensational flashback romance occupying most of the film that moves like a wedding march to a funeral drum and does little to build suspense or understanding. The movie intersperses to the image of pink neon gasses surrounding the planet Solaris constantly as if saying, to increasing annoyance, 'meanwhile back on the ranch"". ""Solaris"" could have been intriguing if it had realized it's psychological and cinematic potential as alternative science-fiction. Come to think of it, haven't I seen all this before, albeit on a much smaller budget, in an episode of the original ""Star Trek""?"
2,Bring back the Soderberg of Schitzopolis,"What happened to that talented and original director who took quirky subject matter and made it brilliant?Who is this imposter making nothing but half-baked remakes of perfectly good movies?A pod person?If you want to see Solaris, a very good film of it was made in the Soviet Union back in the 70's. It was mysterious and tragic and, at the same time, hopeful.All qualities the 2002 version lacks. Characters are merged. Families obliterated.George Cloony may be a pretty face, but any demanding character is beyond him. Solaris is far to subtle a project for him. He needs much more obvious formulaic roles to really shine."
1,Please,"All these rave reviews must be from geeky sci-fi lovers whose genre is usually filled with monsters and busty babes. So when something comes along with a pretention to solemnity, they feel validated and appreciated, and they return the favor by writing raves. But this is truly the emperor who had no clothes -- I defy one of these writers to admit that when they saw Solaris in the theater, they had to pinch themselves to stay awake. This movie is so low-key and somnambulistic that the entire point of the novel is glossed over if not altogether trashed in favor of lots of languid images of Clooney, his bare [rear-end], and his lost love. In the theater where I saw it, people were actually booing when it ended (and not because they wanted it to keep going). Movies are entertainment. They can also be edifying and informative, but beyond those three, there isn't much else a movie can or should do. Solaris fails on all three counts."
1,Does Philip Glass make films now?,"This film is an unbearably boring, irritatingly pretentious waste of celluloid. Were it filmed digitally, it would have been a waste of precious binary code. It raises rather under-elaborated metaphysical questions about life and death (at a sub-glacial, coma inducing pace) then fails to provide any meaningful message. After 90 minutes of waiting for something to happen, something actually does, for which I was extremely grateful: the credits rolled. Video stores should be forced to apply warning stickers to the boxes."
3,"""I Don't Understand.""","I'm probably generous in giving this movie three stars. What a disappointment. The movie can be summed up in one word, dull."" There is a lot of talk here and not much else-- I love a good talk movie of the calibre of, say, LION IN WINTER--but that is not what we have here. You'll be lucky if you can stay awake in this one.Biggest surprise of the movie: That Steven Soderbergh of ERIN BROCKOVICH and other fine movies directed this dog.Best lines from the movie: At one point Natascha McElhone says ""I don't understand"" three times in fairly rapid succession. I couldn't agree more.Best thing about the movie: It's no longer than it is."
3,"Please, not another 'meaning of life' movie","As a sci-fi, techie, shrink-shrunk piece of eye-candy, I guess this movie holds up well, but other than that...well, ho-hum. I gave the movie a second viewing, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around; but no, it was the same 'love outlasts death so why not kill yourself to be with your lost love instead of being lonely' message wrapped up in an off-world experience. Kudos to all of the principle actors (Clooney, McElhone, Davis and Davies) for at least 'sticking with the script' and to the set designers as well, but I'll pass on spending more than the rental price for this one."
2,The Unbearable Density of Solaris,"I recall seeing the original Tarkovsky film in the then dirty and dingy Cinema Village on E. 12th Street. It struck me as an ambitious mess, at times, even crude, hardly crying out for a ""re-make"". Unfortunately, egos not reasons rule in Hollywood.That said, I have enjoyed the non-commercial films of Mr. Soderbergh (THE LIMEY; sex, lies, and videotape,etc.) as opposed to his commercial (ERIN BROCKOVITCH, TRAFFIC,etc.) ones. This time, Mr. Soderbergh's creativity seems to have been subordinate to the company he kept during its making. The filmakers seem so determined to make the viewer prostrate before their consideration of ""serious issues"", the film becomes pervaded by a smugness that renders the material as leaden, inert and lifeless as a small moon."
2,"Lukewarm, Melodramatic","This is a barely lukewarm (i.e., almost cold) and overly melodramatic movie. Although short by typical movie standards, by about 20 minutes, it seems to have been twice as long. This is the type of movie that tries to force its self-importance on you. Like the boyfriend or girlfriend that plays hard-to-get and once connected, you wonder what the suspense was all about -- all surface, no substance.Unfortunately, it seems to be a poor space rendition of movies like ""Sphere"" (which was an excellent book and mediocre movie, but better than this movie) and several others. In other words, a cookie-cutter movie that is run at half-speed."
1,"Lame, Boring, Dull, Pointless, Waste of Time & Money","I was so excited when I heard about this film. Steven Soderbergh, James Cameron, George Clooney, it's Sci-Fi, remake of a classic... But I'm sorry to disagree with everyone else here but I have tried to watch this movie three separate times and cannot get past the 45 minute point. It has a very disjointed feel to it, you don't care about any of the charracters because by the time you meet them they already uninteresting. Hardly anyone speaks and I just cannot stay awake. If you have difficulty sleeping, throw away your Nyquil and pop in your copy of Solaris...or better yet, take mine."
1,One of those movies you might just walk out early,"There aren't very many movies where I'm tempted to walk out early, but this is one of them. In short, this movie is awful. It's slow paced from the get-go, and never picks up the pace. About a half-hour into the show, I silently gave my wife ""two thumbs down"", and she agreed, as did the rest of a very small audience after the show finally ended.Don't waste you money on this snoozer."
1,Completely BORING,"I love all types of movies but, let's call this like we see it ok?This has GOT to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life.It seems as though the director was trying to copy a Stanley Kubrick style film and most assuredly DID NOT accomplish this.The story made no sense and had no resolution! TERRIBLE.Buy this if you have trouble going to sleep at night because believe me, it will put you RIGHT OUT."
1,"Ignore ""top 500""-ers",">The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it. The story can also be described as erotic in timbre, although there is no nudity.Look, if you're going to review movies without actually watching them first, at LEAST read some of the other reviews. This HAS nudity. What do you think we've been going on about?(And let's stop pretending all those who give this an unfavorable review do so because they were disappointed not to find ""Terminator 800"". In fact, we are disappointed to find that Soderburgh has dumbed down Stanislaw Lem's novel and turned it into a religious tract.)"
1,Russian bull-dike from hell,"Absolutely laughable! Clooney plays a nauseating-self-absorbed ""psychiatrist"" called light yrs. Away by an old-equably laughable stooge to check on a gum-chewing meth-head-a paranoid black feminist-only to de plagued by his Russian bull-dike ex-wife-who he puts in the air-lock to float forever- BUT there she is..horses***-but do not be dismayed..Justin bieber's mom signed him for a sequel!"
2,URANUS,This movie was not all that good. What pains me the most is that they never thought to move the space station away from the planet to see if that made the 'things' disappear. If I was the Clooney character that would be the first thing I'd do!
2,Maybe I was just really tired...,"My husband and I had really looked forward to this movie...so why then did we both fall asleep several times? Like I said, maybe we were just really tired. It has wonderful thought provoking moments but they were just not enough to keep us with the movie. Perhaps if we had read the book it would have helped but this is definately a video rental waiting for release."
2,See the Tarkovsky version,"Having read the Stanislaw Lem book and having seen the Tarkovsky film of the same name, I was curious what Hollywood would do to the material. They have made a thorough mess of it, adjusted the plot badly, and altered the ending in a way that doesn't make sense. The performances, however, are fine. The 1972 Tarkovsky version unfolds very slowly (which may make some people crazy) and makes very effective use of a minimal budget, but builds to considerable power. It's a haunting film and thought-provoking, and is far truer to the book. I had hoped the 2002 Soderbergh version would at least make use of Hollywood's considerable CGI abilities to give a visual rendition of some of the strange formations that the Solaris ocean comes up with, but no such luck."
2,What planet is this from? Uranus?,"Take the boredom and disconnection of ""2001"" and combine it with the intelligence of ""The Cell"" and you get a movie that will put you to sleep wondering what on earth is happening. How did George keep a straight face? What sort of movie did he think this would end up being edited into? So many questions, so little time. In honesty, this is an all time fizzer. Maybe it is trying to be intelligent, or maybe I'm just being unfair, but whatever is happening here doesn't end happily for anyone."
3,Compensating factor? Well....,"I have not seen the Russian original film SOLARIS but this American remake struck me as pretty-OK at best, and knowing it is a copy makes sense. However, the MPAA did clear Clooney's butt for a longish sequence. Suffice it to say he is a bear (Woof!)."
3,One Vote for the Unthinking Response,"Previous reviewers have said about all that needs to be said about the content of the film. Clearly there is a difference of opinion, a sharp difference. While no Sci-Fi buff, I have enjoyed many in the long line of such films that began with the experimental French film at the turn of the century (19th to 20th). However, Solaris is a film in which the science fiction aspects are quite irrelevant. They are used only as a backdrop to a man-woman story that could have been put into any setting with slight adjustment.The story itself might have benefited from a supername on the marque; but, through no fault of George Clooney, his presence does not salvage the lackadaisical script and direction. The actress playing his wife, Natascha McElhone, certainly makes one believe she would be missed, the others were simply playing roles with little definition or opportunity for an actor to shine."
3,The point?,I just watched this sci-fi film last night and felt lost when it ended. The film was well done the acting was good the movie is beautiful to look at and the production value is sky high I just felt that I missed the whole reason I was watching this film.I will have to watch it with commentery to see what everything was meaning near the end I just dont know if I can sit though it again. Rent before you buy is my advice.
3,A far cry from the original,Not bad. It's not so much a remake of Tarkovsky's film as it is an interpritation of the book. (by Stanislav Lem). Soderbergh's version is a love story rather than a commentary on human nature and social values.
2,A little slow and confusing,"Although I understood and could follow the plot line of the story, it was confusing.. Most of the movie was done in semi darkness so that it was hard to really see what was happening. At times the music drowned out the voices so that you could not hear what was being said. It reminded me of a low budget film.. This is a movie that I would not have purchase if I had known what it was like before hand."
2,Boy was this ever...Slow,"I guess in the future everybody moves in slow-motion, because that's what this entire movie is filmed in. And when I say entirely slow-motion, I mean ENTIRELY SLOW-MOTION.It's unfortunate, because it seemed to want to have a little potential there for a minute or two..."
1,Anything lower than 1?,"Think of the worst movie you've ever seen. Put this one right below it! Poorly directed, with too much emoting. Old spaghetti westerns are the only comparable style I can use. Would love a refund......."
1,Worst film ever - even 1 star is to much,"I bought this film because of Clooney and Sonderberg without even knowing what it is all about- and I still regret. This is the most enoying, slow and useless film that I have ever seen. The reference made to Kubricks 2001 is an insult to the director. This is the first DVD ( and I do have a few) where I FFWD most of the time because nothing is hapening - don't we all love seeing empty corridors during 5 minutes. Slow camera moves with nothing hapening.If you want to get bored to death buy it, all others should avoid this movie!"
5,Clooney gives one of his best...Solaris is a great movie,"George Clooney (Oceans 11 and 12, From Dusk Till Dawn) brings you into the life of Chris Kelvin who ventures up to a space station called Solaris where he finds that there are only two people left on the ship and the rest of the crew has vanished, so he interrogates the 2 to find out what happened and also in the process he starts to see his dead wife, Natascha McElhone (Laurel Canyon, Truman Show) and then he finds out the real truth of what happened on that ship. A powerfully hypnotic and tense movie with Clooney at the top of his game giving one of his best performances and McElhone has never been more beautiful. Also starring Jeremy Davies (Spanking The Monkey, Going All The Way) and Viola Davis. Directed by Steven Soderbergh and produced by James Cameron."
1,Don't watch in a dim light,"I almost feel bad writing a bad review for this film, but honestly, I am off to the store to go get some more NO-DOZ. This movie is as slow as any that I have ever seen. I've watched half the movie so far, and after seeing George Clooney's but two times too many, I had to run to my computer to warn all potential renters to not rent this movie. Many of the other reviews state that this movie will make you think, well it definately does that. I was thinking about how boring this movie is, and what else can I be doing to keep from wasting my 2 hours, not to mention what other movies I could be watching.Maybe I will finish watching this movie tonight when I have trouble sleeping."
1,COME & GET IT,"If you suffer a sleeping disorder this movie will guarentee you instant relief. Come and get it! It was totally out of this world, literally. Solaris belongs in the 60's era when movies were at there worst. Don't waste your time energy or money on this masterpiece of drivel.The only redeeming feature about this film is George Cloony's good looks and when the film ended. NUMBER ONE WINNER for the academy award for WORST FILM. It even beats the Killer Tomatoes and that's saying something."
1,Oh my god!!!,"This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My thoughts were backed up by the other unfornate souls how happened to go to the same viewing as me. Out of the 30 or so people how were in the theater, about 20-25 of them walked out within the first hour. This movie is so slow and boring, and the ending is so cheesy and stupid. If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would have to be torturous. Avoid this movie at all cost, you will be sorrily disappointed"
1,"Your shrink would like Solaris, but it's not for normal folk","On the up side, good sets and costumes. Lame special effects combo with a plot so crippled that it's wheelchair needs crutches. George Clooney, bless his handsome heart, is unable to rescue this total waste of mind with his limited acting range, although you can see him painfully trying. Unless you are really into abnormal foresnic psychology then within 15 minutes of watching Solaris you will be asking yourself if you really want to sit through the rest of it. I did, and I did sit through the rest and it wasn't worth it. Buy another movie."
2,Falls short of expectations,"The argument for Solaris is that it is an intelligent, though provoking literary movie based in a science-fictional context. One reviewer calls it a ""taut psychological experience that will leave you breathless."" It is not. It is simplistic and unchallenging. The emotional connection between Clooney and his wife is never convincing enough to produce the conundrum of circumstances that are portrayed. I did enjoy the movie. It was beautiful to watch and the performances were excellent, but it simply is not psychologically, emotionally or intellectually intense enough to justify the slow and drawn out pace. It had potential, but comes up short."
1,I've had migranes that were more pleasurable,"Upfront let me state that I love independent, unusual and foreign films, the ones that many people often have never heard of, or dislike. That said, let me state without question that I hated this movie, in fact every single person within earshot expressed loud and long how much they hated this movie. So what is the biggest problem with this film? Simply this, it is interminably dull both visually and in story. Perhaps those [induced in a] haze might find some redeeming qualities in this movie, apparently those I was watching it with were not suitably impaired to fully appreciate it. I spent most of the film waiting for it to end, just to put all of us out of our misery (the audience and the characters). Do not waste your time or money on this film, even a few glimpses of George Clooney's bum don't make it worth the effort required to sit through this. Truly painful to watch."
3,A Plodding Mind Bender,"3.0 out of 5 stars A Plodding Mind Bender, March 10, 2010Well...I didn't hate it.Exactly.Solaris is a plodding mind-bender that will cause you to furrow your brow a dozen times throughout the film. I've watched it twice and am still not 100% sure of what just happened. I got the basics though -- a man goes to a space station that is situated outside a planet called Solaris. The planet seems to have cognizance and is sending 3-D visitors to the space station. Unlike the rest of the crew members, George Clooney's character 'likes' his visitor and after killing her a couple of times, regrets it, and wants her to stay.I'll leave the ending up to you to interpret. No, I understand it. Mostly.Enjoy the movie but don't invest much money into it.Oh-side note, the pacing of the movie is methodical, musical and ethereal and it made me think of Blade Runner.Happy watching!Ellen C Maze, authorA New Kind of Vampire (Paperback and Kindle)"
3,An 'OK' film adaptation.,"First, this would have been an Art House release, if Clooney hadn't starred in it. That is it's target audience.Major difference from the original adaptation: this film only deals with one of the original's subplots. It changes some of the major settings of that subplot, yet still contains the same basic message.For the best effect, you need to let the film wash over you. Soak up the wonderfully subtle steel drums in the soundtrack (which I highly recommend)."
2,Too much like 2001...,"It was obvious to me that they were trying to emulate 2001 with the music and the camera shots. The sets were really neat. The acting was pretty good. The idea is intriguing. Sounds all pretty positive huh? I did give it two stars....What I didn't like was the dialogue, the pace of the movie. The actors did a great job with what they had. I didn't think the nudity was neccessary. It didn't help the story at all.Like I said before it was a lot like 2001. That's treading into some sensitive territory. I liked 2001 a heck of a lot more than Solaris. Solaris was really a drawn out film. 2001 at least had a unique vision that should be left be alone. Solaris didn't give me that. I don't think the story justified the direction they went into.I think if it was filmed differently it could have been a great film. Of course, this is just my opinion."
1,Move over Barton Fink,"The benchmark for all things video awful has been, for us, the overrrated self-important Barton Fink. We rate all movies not by stars but by little Bartons. Well move over Barton - we now will live by Little Solaris's.God this was awful. I wish the guy who edited this with a meat cleaver would have gone after that irritating 'Snow's' hands. I wanted to just rip his hands off . Agh! Agh! agh! stop moving those weird fingers of yours!!!I love sci-fi and have no trouble following some complicated ether-world story lines but I really had a hard time with this. So where were they in the end? The Nexus err... Solaris?Thankfully the DVD skipped and froze a few times so I can get my $1.88 back."
1,A subtle masterpiece? Which movie did he watch?,"I had heard this was a 'slow' movie and I had adjusted my expectations accordingly. I looked forward to uncovering the riddle. The movie contains, on average, about 10 lines of dialogue for every 7 minutes of film. I cannot remember a single satisfying scene. No music. No laugh. Not even a thoughtful epiphany. I kept expecting to be drawn-in by thoughtful dialogue about humanity reaching the stars. I did NOT enjoy one minute of this movie. It has absolutely no continuity - due in large part to endless (and quite meaningless) flashbacks. Even more frustrating, it lacks any sense of chemistry - I couldn't care less who dies and who lives. It lacks a protagonist and an antagonist. It lacks any sense of suspense - other than the viewers' own longing for thoughtful diaglogue to cause us to question our own existence. Some have touted this movie as sublime or sutle - hog wash. This movie is a TURKEY."
1,NOBODY TALKED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE FILM,"Throughout this entire film, the actors just STARED at each other. Nobody answered any damn questions, they just STARED. Nobody conversed - THEY JUST STARED. That's all this was. Staring. And George Clooney's naked ass. Hardly worth it."
5,Solaris,"I enjoyed this movie. Many might not like this movie because its slow and perhaps hard to follow. It involved crew memebers on a planet called solaris. Something was going wrong so they called in a Psychologist (George Clooney) to find out what was going on the planet Solaris (Sol r us..hehehe), a planet which made the crew memebers materialize their desires or memories. Whatever energy or entity was on this planet it was tapping into or experimenting with the human soul or consciousness. Perhaps it was changing the human makeup. A type of ""CoEvolution"";o)"
1,Solaris is a Waste of Film,"This movie came on last week. I tried to watch it. I was so bored out of my skull I actually turned it off. In 50 years of watching Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror and loving even the schlockiest of it, I can count the number of times I've refused to watch something on one hand and have fingers left over, but this was one of the worst. Don't waste your time!"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"PEOPLE ACTUALLY WALKED OUT THE THEATRE. THAT'S HOW BAD THIS MOVIE WAS NOT EVEN WORTH THE 19 CENTS IT COST! BORING, DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE 30 MINS I SAT THRU??"
3,Trippy Space Movie,I have waitied for movies like this for a long time. Nothing better than a movie that help you questions metaphysics and ethics in general. Watch this movie and your mind will be blown wide open. Very good Sci-Fi movie.
2,Solaris,"I enjoy all types of Sci Fi, and this is an old story. Maybe because I read the book but I enjoyed the book much more than this move. I was falling asleep......"
1,"Super Expected, super boring",The movie went nowhere. Very little information on the phenomenon was given at the end and hardly anything was resolved. It was also an extremely slow paced for a movie with little to offer.
2,Pseudo-Intellectual,"Soderberg tries very hard to be a grown-up but he lacks the gravitas. He's just kid looking for approval by aping other people's art. It's weak. THIS is weak. This is not an homage to the greatest Soviet film ever made, it's a Xerox dressed up as a Hallmark card pretending to be a Bible. It's a failure. The Soviet film is so much greater even as it is much more flawed. This is not a ""bad"" film, it's the abortion of a great one. See the original."
3,"Interesting, rent it though, don't buy",This movie maybe tries too hard...it didn't really go anywhere.
1,sad but true,"I nearly fell asleep in the first 20 minutes, and frankly I could not get past those first 20. I wanted very much to like this film because it seemed like an interesting premise/idea. The Russian original was certainly to my liking. Unfortunately, though, this was just very dry and difficult to follow."
1,Not a great idea to make this kind of movie,"I think you need to understand and love Andrey Trkowski's ideas and then make a movie. It was the most stupid idea for an American director to do it. He doesn's understand it himself, so how he can lead his actor's team. J.Klooney was worried about his reputation as an actor. And he was right.This movie is a looser."
1,And the award goes to.......,"This movie won my ""Worst of the year"" award. I thought this film had great potential, but it never lived up to its potential. I really wanted to see this movie, about after seeing it. I wish I had seen ""Dude Where's my car"" instead."
1,unambiguously terrible,"This is definitely the worst movie I saw last year -- it may be the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The music was annoying, the lighting dark, the acting almost non-existent and the story ridiculous. Even a die hard George Clooney find would find little to like in this amazingly bad movie. (I took a friend last year, and his distaste was sufficiently strong that he still won't let me choose any new movies.)"
1,Pretty bad,I was very disappointed with this one. It is boring and dull and just draggggssss on. A great actor and plot were wasted on this movie. I wish I had read more reviews before buying it!
3,"Nice try, but somehow hollow.","I applaud George Clooney for his attempt to make an intelligent Science Fiction movie, I approve of his selection of material, though the Tarkovsky original carries its own baggage and equalling or improving on it was always going to be difficult. Knowing that the late Stanislaw Lem didn't much like it should have given some scope for getting closer to the heart of the book. But it's an opportunity they elected not to take, deciding to add bits that would presumably make it more accessible to a modern cinema audience. Rewriting a modern Sci Fi classic to this extent is pretty near unforgivable. The plot thread about Cris and Reas' courtship is entirely spurious and the happy ending pure Hollywood schmaltz with a tad of pseudo religious waffle.It's interesting, but somehow the compromises that Hollywood deemed necessary to make the film more appealing have done it no favours and it misses the target by some margin."
1,Clooney is anti-America,"So outspoken politically, I think he should stick to politics because I will never buy anything that has to do with him again."
2,Not Nearly As Good As The Original,"This new Hollywood remake of the classic Russian sci-fi film from 1972 is not nearly as intelligent, nor will it be as lasting. Indeed, this modern ""remake"" will likely be forgotten in a few years, whereas the legendary original will still be respected.The Clooney remake lacks the philosophical depth of it's predecessor and cheapens it into a sappy love story with New Age trappings and the typical plot-twist at the end. It's formulized whereas the original truly was an original in more ways than one.It's fun comparing these two films side-by-side. It clearly shows the money-driven ambition of Hollywood today and the dumbing-down of modern cinema. But if you haven't, you MUST see the original Solaris by Tarkovsky! The main difference between these two films is that the original Tarkovsky film is a masterpiece, whereas the Soderberg remake is something to do for two hours."
1,the movie is awful,BORING!!! could have been alot better. plus the really sad thing is his wife is never really alive....talk about some emotionless acting! they must have just needed a pretty girl. a blow up doll would have had more personality.I watched with my sister and we both agree that it was and hour and a half too long.
3,You've seen it on Star Trek already,"A good movie, and visually great, but you have seen the basic plot on countless episodes of Star Trek, Next Generation.The story is very simple so most of the movie is close ups of the male and female leads."
3,is it just me?,"whatever you can say about this movie, this novel or this adaptation - don't the ""Sphere"" and the ""Event Horizon"" seem just a TAD bit derivative?!? in both of the above films the 'mirroring' effect and the dead (wife, child,lover) seem to be so akin to Lem's original story as to be a bit suspicious.... (Lem's novel was writen back in the 1960's)read the book and mourn the death of both Lem and Roddenberry."
3,Good brief summary descriptions thru 2004 models.,"Since 2004 is 7 years ago, the information is good, but not current. Also the boats covered are 18 to 27 feet, not 27 to 63 feet as described on amazon.com.Needs new current edition to update prices and models and longer Chapter intros with more info on general characteristics of bowriders, express cruisers, cuddy cabins and deckboats."
2,Type too light,It was great getting a new title of Mary Roberts Reinhart but the type was too light to read. I was going to give as a gift but instead gave it after Christmasas a possibilty and my sister agreed probably too hard to read though I'm still going to try.
4,"Good variation on ""locked room mystery""","This WAS a really good variation on the ""locked room mystery."" What more isolated place than on the open sea? Incidentally, today this type of mystery is becoming almost impossible to write because of technology, i.e. cell phones, etc.For me, this story was much deeper than just the murders. One entire level was the constant terror everyone must have felt during every waking moment, the uncertainty of whether the person in front of them at that moment was the killer.I do agree with another reviewer that there were absolutely no clues to the identity of the killer although there were plenty of red herrings. However, as a replier said, maybe Rinehart's goal was to simply showcase an injustice in real life. A very good read."
3,The Saga is Not Yet Complete,"This book is filled with bloopers, technical flaws, fun facts, and inconsistencies about the ""Star Wars"" saga. I do like this book, and I found a number of things I'd seen in my repeated viewings of the films, as well as many items I'd never noticed before. All of this is good, but for a book released towards the end of 2005 and purporting to be about the ""Star Wars"" saga, it should have more on ""Episode III"" than just a cartoon containing the words ""Coming Soon"". That's right, the book does not cover ""Episode III"" at all.All in all this is a fun book for ""Star Wars"" fans, but potential buyers should be warned that this version does not cover the entire saga."
2,Everything wrong with Star Wars that you never cared about,"If you need to win a bet about how many times a stormtrooper's movement is repeated, or have never noticed how many times Han Solo touches Princess Leia inappropriately, this is definitely the book for you. Unlike Phil Farrand's series of Nitpicker's Guides, there's not a lot of humor, and the book bogs down into a series of boring lists fairly quickly. Also unlike Farrand's books, however, this book includes DVD/VHS timecode, so you can look specifically for the nits you find most interesting. But the really important questions are never raised--like why the Death Star has to have an entire-station-destructive weakness? Like Stewie said, put some plywood over it or something..."
4,DEFINATELY A NOVEL THAT EXOLRES THE MORAL VALUES OF HUMANS.,"AS A GRADE 11 STUDENT, I AM EXPECTED TO MOAN AND COMPLAIN ABOUT A SEEMINGLY LONG AND BORING NOVEL THAT I AM REQUIRED TO READ IN MY ENGLISH CLASS.... INSTEAD, I FOUND THAT THIS NOVEL WAS THE FIRST THAT DARED TO REALLY DIG DEEP DOWN INTO THE MORAL AND ETHICAL VALUES OF HUMEN BEINGS. THIS NOVEL REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE STRONG, THE WEAK, THE RICH, THE POOR, AND THOSE WHO ARE FALSE, AND THOSE WHO ARE TRUE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NOVEL IS AN INVESTMENT OF TIME THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LOOK INTO... IT'S WELL WORTH IT!!!"
5,Must Have,"Great book with plenty of slide photos of blood samples. Detailed descriptions but no messing about with overly long paragraphs. It gets right to the point telling you what the cell is, what body processes made them occur, etc. Making it quick and easy to identify cell types. Book is also (including index) only 228 pages making it easy to keep at your workspace.The contents is as follows:Blood1) Examination of blood samples2) Erythrocytes3) Leukocytes4) Platelets5) Miscellaneous Cells and ParasitesBone Marrow6) Hematopoeisis7) Bone marrow examination8) Disorders of Bone marrow9) Hematopoietic neoplasms10) Nonhematopoeitic NeoplasmsAnd the appendix has an example of bone marrow evaluation and interpretation"
4,VERY NICE!,"This book is smaller and thinner than I imagined, and the illustrated diagrams are recycled from older books... but the amount of photographs is astounding! Overall, this title is well worthy!"
1,Conmen,Im sorry I never received the product though I paid and have been waiting for over a Year. Becareful with this seller. What he advertise is not he sell.
1,Better off buying a really powerful megaphone....,"Terrible phone in general. I was a real big Nokia fan until I got this phone. It feels cheap in your hands when you hold it. It slides open and you accident dial people when it is in your pocket. The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena. The phone completely stopped working when I was on a train ride to Chicago to meet a potential client. Overall I am extremely disgusted in this phone; that's right, disgusted. I ended up returning this phone (thank goodness I got it from Amazon.com and it was easily returned with full refund). The next day I walked into my ATT store and bought the iphone. Best decision I made ever since dropping Nokia completely =) Oh and for the record....If i could vote lower than 1 star I would."
4,great,I give this movie 4**** This movie was great you will not be disappointed in watch this film .I'm a zombie movie fan and I haven't seen a movie this good since Dawn of The Dead and of course The walking Dead .I must say that British are really making great zombie movies. I think they need to merge with some of the film maker in the U.S and come up with a great zombie film. Until next time I wilL looking for another zombie file that's worth watching over and over.
1,Sub Par Zombie Movie,"Devil's Playground was a lame movie lacking in almost every way possible. Multiple inconsistancies, weak plot, ignorant characters, and just annoying. Don't waste your time or money on this lousy movie."
4,good movie,"I actually really liked this movie. I like how the Brits do the infection thing rather than just the plain old zombie thing. These bad boys can run and jump, which I gotta say is entertaining because you know that they can chase your butt down. I liked the fact that it had a backstory instead of just waking up and everyone being infected. The acting was really good too which is a plus in the movie's favor. I am definitely going to be adding this to my collection for sure."
4,Good Movie,"I Love a good zombie movie, and this one didn't disappoint, if you likes 28 days, you'll like this, It's not as much a Zombie movie, more of an ""infected"" movie, they can move fast! the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because of the sound, kind of annoying.."
3,Not Bad,"I like zombie flicks. This one wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either. A creative twist to the typical zombie genre."
4,Action packed fast moving,As most Zombi movies go I would rate this in the top 20%. Acting is pretty good and the ending is fitting. Not a double watcher though.
4,Good one to watch,"I really like this film. I found the story, acting, and zombie madness a good watch. It reminded me of 28 days later, another good film. I bought this movie after renting it."
3,pandemic by greed,"Excellent acting and good effects make for an enjoyavle thriller. A exciting b film. Will please all but the weaak of heart, or those with touchy stomachs. My these zomvies are sure fast,put on your track shoes"
5,Really Well Done,"This Is a must see for people who love zombie movies. Totally draws you in. There were several parts that really had me tense. The zombies in this movie are fast moving, agile and almost acrobatic. Not the agonizingly slow ones you see in other zombie movies, where a 5 year old could get away from them. A great way to spend an hour and a half."
2,Can't recommend this one,"Did not really care for this one. I don'teven remember is I finished watching thefilm to be honest. Seemed kind of ""cheezy"".Thumbs down."
3,A facile look into the Zombie genre,"There's nothing new here. In this particular case the zombies are created via some lab induced virus. The subplot such as it is involves getting the lone person immune to the virus to a lab so an antiviral can be concocted... who hasn't seen half a dozen movies with that gimmick? Other than that it's pretty much normal zombie shenanigans. A group of strangers thrown together must learn how to survive the horde and each other. Pretty much Romero's formulae but you can't fault the movie for that... it's a good formulae. Decent acting, decent effects, decent production value, it's just a bit shy on innovation. A decent buy for zombie enthusiasts kinda boring for most others. def worth watching for free though."
4,Devil's Playground,Great horror...lots of bloody scenes...action galore...the acting is superior for this type of film...the scenes stay with you for a long time. Recommended!
4,A Nice twist on Zombies,"This movie puts a different twist on zombie movies, the brits no how to make these movies I will not give away much just to say the zombies do not walk around so slow and uncordinated, and definently not an easy target. These zombies are the complete opposite, the main man the mercenary gets bit he is given three injections to last him 18hrs. This is the time he has to find the girl, the acting was very good in fact for you Dexter Fans, Dexters Brit girlfreind a couple of seasons ago is in this movie, I will put it this way she does not make it all in all an easy 4 stars, very good movie it also looks like it ends ready to go to part 2, we can only hope. Larry Jones and by the way Netflix has it for free on streaming."
3,"I was a little bored, to be honest.","The effects were good. They obviously put a lot of work into acrobatics. The story made sense and was consistent. It's not a bad zombie movie. I liked the cast, but I didn't feel drawn in. I wasn't moved. I was honestly a little bored."
3,Worth viewing,Not a bad film as zombie movies go. Plenty of action and these zombies are fast and mean instead of slow shambling creatures. Well worth viewing.
3,Pretty Good by Common Zombie Movie,This was a zombie movie in the Vein of 28 Days Later where the zombies turn really quickly and they run at top speed towards their victim. It did not escape the cliches of the genre where it all started out as some biotech product that was released to the public and there is only one person who did not become symptomatic and we have to get her to the lab quick basic format. Even so this was digestable and will probably be acceptable especially for fans of the zombie movie.
3,it doesn't suck,"a relatively fresh premise in the world of zombies. a performance enhancing drug turns all but one of it's test patients into superhuman killers, with an insatiable bloodlust. our main character's mission is to track down that one person. the zombies are pretty intense in this one. the problem i have with this story is that this isn't an infectious outbreak. it's a chemical. so, the zombies turning others into zombies, by biting them, doesn't really work so well here. other than that, i was entertained. good special effects. pretty decent acting. it doesn't suck."
3,Measure depth of the bowl area first!,"The concept is great, however the bowl area is not deep enough to slide down over both RV lips to keep them secure. The plastic is not pliable enough to bend. To force it you might wind up breaking your coach gutter pieces. I'll have to look elsewhere. This part is not universal."
2,Superfly,I enjoyed the movie when it first came out in the early 70's and had been looking for it & was told by a firend where I could find it...was glad I did but the quality of the movie isn't what it should be & to me it seemed like there were a few scenes missing from it......all in all I am glad I found it but I thought it would be better quality
5,Still Fly After All these Years,"Super Fly came out in 1972 and is still controversial. Critics say that the story glorifies drugs. I disagree. Ron O Neal (a brilliant actor who simply came on the scene before his time) as Priest is an intense and intelligent character. He knows he's in a dirty game and he's sick of playing it and longs to get out. Junkies are portrayed as pitiful creatures that no one in their right mind would want to emulate. Priest's partner is a greedy, blind fool and his mentor Scatter is living proof that the game can bite you. Add this complex story to Curtis Mayfield's brilliant score and you have what may be the greatest of the blackploitaiton movies. I just want to know when this is going to come out on DVD."
3,Now this is old school!,"Well,you can't compare this film to movies from today,but that how the70s were!I personally think they should have invested more in the sound,I mean they could have re-mastered it,especially since it's such a cool soundtrack.It simply doesn't do Curtis Mayfield justice.But I don't regret it!"
5,commentary is excellent!!!!,The commentary on this film is excellent! Top Notch! The film itself is a masterpiece and the rough character is totally understandable and actually adds to the quality overall. The commentary really puts so much in context and also provides genuine insight and humor. recommended for anyone interested in urban issues and 1970's New York City history.
3,70's style,"I thought this was a decent blaxploitation film. Drugs and money isn't everything to preist, the main character in the film who wants to get out of the pusher business. It's kind of slow but I still like it"
2,The Costume Designer Was On Point,"Instead of giving props to the movie, which was marginal at best. I'll speak on the costume designer. Bravo for the clothes...they were ""Out Of Sight!"" Also, Priest's car was the sickest car I've ever seen in my life...I want one."
5,BEST OL' SKOOL FLICK OUT,"I WAS JUST 4 YEARS OLD WHEN THIS MOVIE CAME OUT. WHEN I CAME UP OF AGE I CHECKED OUT MY FATHER'S COLLECTION AND HE HAD IT. WHEN I SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. ESPECIALLY THE WAY HOW ""PRIEST'S"" '73 ELDERADO WAS FIXED UP. IF ONLY IF IT WAS OUT ON DVD, I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY MAKE SURE I'LL GET IT!!!!"
2,"Fantasic flick, but atrocious audio","I write this review in regard to the DVD version of this movie in particular. Superfly is indeed a great movie, from its gritty ambiance, outlandish costumes, superb soundtrack, unsentimental dialogue and straight-up action. However, the sound quality on the DVD is quite poor, which is an absolute shame in light of the music that is a genuine reflection of its place and era. Even with the volume turned up much higher than for any other DVDs I have, the dialogue and music were still extremely muffled. While I am usually not hung up on technical features, the poor quality of the audio substantially diminished my enjoyment of an otherwise classic movie, which explains the above rating."
1,Horrible in it's implications,"After seeing the final product, Curtis Mayfield, who wrote the admittedly brilliant score for this complained that it was a ""Cocaine commercial."" He was right. Ron O'Neal as a coke dealer with all the cars, money, and women paved the way for misleading at least two generations of Black youth into thinking that this lifestyle is the way out of the ghetto (it was also a big influence on the hip hop generation).Allen Hoskins (""Farina"" from the Our Gang comedies) complained in an interview that films like this sent the wrong impressions to Black kids who may not have had naything better to look up to. You said a mouthful!"
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I loved it so much when I saw it in the early 70's, but over time it seems dated and corny. Ron O'Neal's performance as Priest seems stilted and forced. Best thing I can say about it now is that it has a wonderful score from Curtis Mayfield that DOES still hold up. Buy the music and forget the film."
3,I didn't watch it all,This was not my kind of movie. You would have to see for yourself. I can or can't recommend it right now. Maybe l have to view it again.
4,Funny Fan Service,"This series continues on making absolutely zero excuses for itself. It doesn't pretend to be intelligent or witty and will attempt to make you laugh with fan service and physical jokes that will occasionally have most of the male population crossing their legs. Providing that you can allow yourself to just enjoy the humor, you should find yourself having a mostly enjoyable experience. The lack of a real story to tie it all together though continues to work against this series that continues to leave me with an empty feeling every time I finish a volume. I enjoy it while it's in my player but once it's done, I don't find myself wishing that there were more to watch right away. It continues to be worth checking out but unless the final volume provides a HUGE payoff, I'm not predicting that you're going to find much replay value out of it."
5,great soap a bit drying,Great product didn't do much for my face but love using for my body!! works well to get rid of body acne
1,Horrible,this soap burns it broke me out in blemish marks.it may work for you but it didnt work for me an it took me using this soap for 2 days to see this one time aday.have a back plan for when it doesn't work.
2,Good book...horrible transfer to ebook.,"Please note that the low rating is for the transfer to Kindle ebook. I like the book itself and Lumley's writing in general. This transfer however is bad...it looks like a ripped off scan that you'd find on a download site. Almost all the commas have become apostrophes, at some places I's have become 1's, some words are just completely mangled. It's distracting to read and pretty disappointing for a $10 ebook!"
4,Excellent second rate Lovecraft,"Brian Lumley is an excellent writer. That is fact. He has sold millions of books in his career. These stories are basically from early in his career, though, when he was writing very derivative, but very effective, Lovecraft pastiches. If you are a fan of HP Lovecraft, you will probably love this book. If you are not, then you will hate it. I loved it, and am glad that these stories are out in this edition."
5,The best scientific calculator ever made,"The HP-42s is without any doubt the best scientific calculator ever made. Not only does it Matrix and Complex calculations smoothly, but it is also fully compatible with the next best scientific calculator, the HP-41c. You can also print your programs / results if you own the HP-IR printer (82240B or 82240A)."
4,Interesting Soundtrack,"This is a well-done and elegant movie with a superb soundtrack. The classical selections used in the film fit the scene where they provide background music. The emotional element of the score is perfect. If you like Mozart, Handel and Vivaldi, this is the track to have."
2,Awesome- until it dies,"Excellent product for about 6 months. Then it refused to brew. I tried the vinegar cleaning, took it apart- it just doesn't work anymore."
2,Did not last long,"I purchased item in May 2008, it died in October 2008. It just stopped brewing and made ""monster in the pipes"" noises. You can't take it apart to try and troubleshoot it. Until it broke, it did well.Update: Hamilton Beach will replace it, got bumped to three stars. But it costs $5 in shipping to get it, down to two stars."
1,Four months and out,"We had the black Hamilton Beach 42115 3-in-1 Hot-Beverage Center and enjoyed it for 4 months. It was just the right size for a cup of coffee or tea. But after four months it has stopped working (though we've followed all of the cleaning instructions). It will heat up for a while, and produce some steam, but little or no hot water/tea/coffee actually comes out of the nozzle any more."
5,beverage center,"I've had this appliance for about a month and so far I love it. Haven't tried anything but my hot tea, but it steeps better than any machine I've had before and comes out hotter than the others, even those with a warmer. It'd probably be great with coffee, but I'll never know. The reservoir holds enough water for a tall insulated cup at maximum. I'd have liked to know more about its steeping method and its size as it looked quite clunky, but it's not bad. It fits under the counter and against the backsplash when not in use and it steeps good tea. It turns off when finished, so I don't have to worry about leaving it on. I'll try chocolate and soups this winter, and I'm sure I'll still like it!"
4,Great hot coffee,"This coffemaker was easy to setup and made really hot coffee. No noise, super quiet didnt even know it was on. The only thing I didnt like was that you need to remove the water tray to fill it up, although it doesnt spill its kind of a hassle. but would definately purchase again"
4,Great Single serve option,"I will have to qualify this review as someone who drinks mostly k-cups with a Keurig machine at work. This machine gets used very sparingly but when it does it makes a very good cup of coffee. So good, I have gotten my mother in law to purchase one and her mother as well. We all love the fact that you can brew one cup of your favorite coffee but vary the flavor of the next cup. Very versatile."
4,good coffee maker-but:,"The only drawback is the permanent filter, which like all of this type leave you with very fine ""mud"" in your coffee. A cut down #4 cone filter (or possibly a #1, I'll get a box and try them to see if I can get away from cutting an inch or so off the #4's, but had them on hand) can be made to fit inside the permanent filter and filters out that ""mud"" for a cup with nothing left in the bottom of the cup. Of course this mean using more filters than you would with a 10-12 cup coffeemaker, but with this model you have fresh coffee each cup instead of ""left-over"". :)"
4,Works like a charm.,"Works great, put in cold water and get hot water. only thing is you get all the water you put in, so be careful to not fill it with too much water. The power cord is extremely short"
5,Hamilton Beach 42115 3-in1 Hot Beverage Center Black,The hamilton beach is everything I hoped. Very easy I cup and I am out the door. Clean up a breeze. I like it very much and would recommend this to everyone .
4,Get a Good Cup!,"I ordered this one cup coffee maker and love it. When I first started using it the coffee kept having a plastic taste to it even though I had washed it prior to use, tried running vinegar through it a few times, and ran hot water through it to rinse it. It took me initially about 8 attempts to get the coffee to taste like I like it trying to figure out how many pods to use or how much ground coffee to use. I finally discovered if I brewed the coffee into a ceramic mug first and then dumped the mug into my plastic to go coffee cup, the coffee did not have a plastic taste to it. This is a good product that makes good coffee once you figure out how much to brew to get the taste you like. I just wouldn't recommend brewing directly into a plastic coffee mug unless you like the taste of plastic so ""Get a Good Cup."""
5,Hamilton Beach Hot Beverage Center a good buy,"the product is a good price for an excellent coffee maker. Unlike other one cup makers, it is fast to brew and doesn't make a giant mess during brewing. cleaning the filter and water reservoir is easy. i give it 5 stars"
2,Faulty Equipment,"I thought this was going to be a good item, but to my surprise, when I used it, it did not brew and it did not heat up. Once I returned it, I was only going to get a small refund, which was okay, but I have never received the refund. Dollarite owes me money, and I should have had it by now."
1,Totally disappointed,"I purchased a Hamilton Beach three-in-one hot beverage center as a gift for my friend. She was only too delighted to receive and use it. Everything was good - performance, design, ease of use and accessibility, which was a drawing card since both my friend and I are totally blind. But after a week, the appliance stopped working for no apparent reason. Thinking it was just a bad luck with a defective unit, I purchased another one. It only worked for an hour and quit just as the first one did. I would not recommend it to anyone, as I consider it unreliable."
2,"Started good, but later failed","When I first got this I was thrilled! It made a great cup of coffee or tea, plus could be used to heat water for instant hot cereal. After just 4 short months, it won't brew at all. I tried cleaning it like the manual states, but no improvement. I called Hamilton Beach and they will replace it for $11.99. That is half of what I paid for it brand new! I will be looking for a different model to replace this. Too many people have complained about the same problem and I fear after a few more months, the replacement will die as well. Save yourself money in the long run and go with something a little better the first time."
2,Great while it worked for 9 months,"I bought one for myself and one for my mother at the same time. My mother's stopped working after about 5 months and mine just over 9 months. Both the same way, the coffee maker made all the sounds but it stopped pulling the water from the reseviour to brew the coffee. What a shame, it was great while it worked. My last 1-cup at-a-time was a Back n Decker that still works after 7 years. I have it at my job."
4,one cup coffee maker,"It meets my needs for a one-cup coffee maker, but I was somewhat disappointed in the cup holder into which the cup sits. It is a little wobbly."
4,A reliable machine,"I bought this HB Beverage Center two years ago on sale at Target and don't have a complaint -ok, the coffee sediment in the bottom of my cup..yes...but that has a simple remedy. I have purchased 100.00 coffee makers from Cusinart and Delongi, both of which died on me after only a couple months. This one is an amazing value when you consider the money being shelled out for these expensive one cup makers with their wasteful plastic cups. It does fits pods, for thoses of if you that like that dishwater coffee. With the HB you have a gold filter that allows plenty of your favorite grinds to ensure you have a good strong and bold cup, but you will have to wait an additonal 3 minutes for your cup - god forbid!"
4,love it,"We love this although it is our second one, the first lasted about a year. Hopefully this one will last longer. It is nice because we never waste coffee by throwing out the last cup in the big pot that no one drank because it was too old or cold. No pots to clean, you make it right in the cup. Everyone can make it to their own taste. No special coffee filters or packages you have to buy, just use your regular coffee."
2,Burn out,"I liked the single cup plan with little prep time. Unfortunately, the heating element burned out within a week and I had to return it. Amazon makes that easy, too! It's a great concept kitchen item, but I got the defective one."
1,Waste of money.,"This brewed about four cups of coffee before it stopped working. Just like so many other people's experiences with this machine, I fill the resevior and no water comes out. Clearly, something is seriously wrong with the design of this product. Don't waste your money."
2,Broke after 3 months,"I originally got this coffee maker using rewards points from a credit card. I ordered this particular model for it's low price and features. I mostly used it to make one cup of coffee in the mornings. The water reservoir holds about enough to make 6-8 ounces of coffee, if you want to use a larger cup or a coffee mug, you have to refill the reservoir once the coffee maker shuts off after making the first cup. After two months it started making popping noises, but that was not the main problem. The instructions say to wait 30 seconds before turning on the coffee maker to make a second cup. But pressing down on the ""on"" switch to make the second cup becomes difficult. After 3 months of use the switch broke. I will ask for a refund as I plan to buy a different model."
2,"okay, but a bit disappointing","This coffee pot has some good features to it. It allows you to use podsIt allows you to use different sizes of cups.The bad thing is that when you plug it in, the hot water starts, there is no buttonto turn it on or off, so you better be ready when you plug it in.My son wanted it for at his fraternity house and he seems okay with the design,but, if it were mine, I would have sent it back."
1,Bad Design,"My husband bought this and we have had it over 2 years without any of the issues others have experienced. However, the water reservoir is a bad design. It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again."
1,"Mine sucked, too","I asked for this for Christmas and was really looking forward to receiving it. Mine, too, heated without pumping. What a letdown. Vendor credited my mom without asking for the return of the product or offering to replace, which leads me to believe this is a very common problem."
1,Hamilton Beach = Hamilton Junk,"The ""3-in-1 Hot Beverage Center"" arrived promptly from Amazon and I was eager to get underway having purchased hot chocolate, which I normally don't drink but wanted to see this product in action.After a relatively awkward setup, the unit powered up and then quickly shut down. I re-read the instructions and it was not supposed to have done that. No matter, I tried it again....and again....and then called Hamilton Beach. I got the usual telephone menu, sat on hold for a few minutes and finally a non-English speaking agent answers (no surprise there!) and asks me my name. I decided to see if they could help, which became evident (within 10 seconds) that they couldn't, I hung up.Totally frustrated, I decided to return this and just get a plain no-frills coffee maker, which I did and have no complaints.This is my third Hamilton Beach purchase and I have concluded with absolute certainty that their products are substandard, defective, poorly made products."
2,too bad we took a chance,"We had read other reviews of this product before purchasing it. A number of those reviews reported the the beverage center to be unreliable. The beverage center, however, seemed to fill the niche perfectly for someone who doesn't need large quantities and wants to have their choice of hot beverages, not just coffee. Because of this we decided to take a chance and purchase it. Big mistake. Just as described in other reviews, it stopped working properly within two weeks. If it sits for a week it will work once, then requires another week of recovery before it will work again, once."
1,Flaws still exist .... or I got someone else's reject,"The concept is great - Single-serve hot-beverage center for coffee, tea, or hot water! I must have received one of the ""flawed"" ones. I read the instructions, as suggested in other reviews and also followed them. It brewed 1 cup; a few days later, when I tried to brew a cup of coffee, it steamed, spitted and sputtered, and then shut off. I waited the recommended time, (and then some!) to try another cup...NADA! (same thing). The power switch shut right off; would not turn back on (after the recommended time wait). I cleaned it, (giving it some TLC...as I REALLY wanted this to work), put it away, thinking ""third time's a charm"". Nope, not in my case. Still same thing, so I shipped it back and requested a refund. Now I am searching and reading reviews for another single-serve brewing unit that WILL work (to replace my ""flawed"" one)."
1,Poor product,"I am on my THIRD machine. It keeps leaking water after a short time, and HB keeps replacing it, but I don't have much time left on my warranty, and I cannot recommend this product that keeps failing."
5,Easy to Use & Fast,"I have already had one of these so I knew it I would like it. It's fast, easy and hot. The first one only lasted 2 years, so I'm hoping this one will last longer."
1,Disappointment,I was excited to try this thing out. I took it out of the box and plugged it in and it didn't work at all. Nothing happened. I called customer support and the woman said I could either cut the cord off and send it to her and they'd send me another one (but that I'd have to pay shipping) or send it back to Amazon. Amazon has a better return policy so I just sent it back for a refund and bought a coffee maker I could look at before purchasing. It just makes me upset that these companies do everything they can to *not* take responsibility for their shoddy product.
3,A rather silly device,"I've been using this for a year or so and it's quite silly. There are two reasons I'm dinging it two stars:1) There's no easy way to measure water. You really do have to first measure the water in whatever you intend to drink from and then put it in this. Perhaps it seems a minor complaint but in practice it becomes an irritant, particularly if it's a communal device and perhaps your mug is not completely sterile :)2) Often this thing will not seal properly when closed and just starts steaming the room. You then get to your cup of coffee and 300 ml are about 100 ml of thick coffee with steam rising up everywhere. This happens often.It's really just a silly coffee machine. It even looks awkward."
2,great if you like watered down coffee and dealing with broken hardware,"I tried one of these and returned it shortly thereafter because the unit stopped working. I'm actually glad it broke because it made the weakest coffee imaginable. It doesn't pressurize the water nor does it get it hot enough to make a good, strong cup of coffee. If you like your coffee on the weak side, yiou might like this, but if you like it Twin Peaks style, look elsewhere."
1,I hate it!!!!,Bought this for assorted hot beverages and I really hate it! VERY slow even for hot water and forget the pods - I tried using 2 and it still brewed it so weak it was colored water. Would rather pay more and get one that works.
1,What a piece of crap,"Turned it on, to do prep with just water. Dribbled out, then quit working forever, do NOT buy this cheap, poorly built unit, woth about 10 dollars max. Lid stuck and woouldn't close until I wrestled with it for ten minutes, plastic junk. ZERO stars"
5,A Must For Opticians,"This book has considerable more content than the previous second edition and is required reading for many college ophthalmic programs. As a reference book, it is by far the most useful to me."
5,Just fine,Arrived just as described! The book came early so that was nice because I needed fast! The vendor was good!
5,HERE IS A GOOD REVIEW,i am very pleased with the delivery of this book. It was a good purchase i needed it for school and now i have it. its a very practical book for the field so i would recommend getting this book.
4,Pretty good,"This is a solid effort. Not the typical stuff on the radio right now. Worth a chance. Only thing, is that I kept waiting for Raphael to jump out of somewhere.Najee, Darius Rucker from Hootie & The Blowfish... Live guitar... Its cool."
3,GIVE IT UP,"I RECENTLY PURCAHSED DWAYNE WIGGINS CD AND I MUST SAY I WAS FAR MORE PLEASED W/HIS CD THAN THAT JIVE A-- SINGLE PUT OUT BY LUCY PEARL! I LOVE THE FUNK AND GOTTA HAVE THE FUNK! ROCK ON D WIGG, KEEP THE FUNK AND SPIRIT OF REAL R-N-B ALIVE!"
4,Life without Raphael!,"first off, both dwayne and raphael can't make a 5 star cd w/out each other...but, this is one of best cd's for any brotha between 30 and 35. i'm not trying to acting like i'm some music critic for word up, but all of the songs slam, a dwayne can still shine in this music-thing."
1,A not-so-great first effort...,"Dwayne Wiggins, one-third of the 90's super soul group Tony!Toni!Toné!, let's fans down with this dismal solo effort. Executive producer Kedar Massenberg (who is responsible for such classic first efforts from Erykah Badu, D'Angelo, Chico DeBarge and India.Irie) must have had a hole in his bag of tricks throughout the recording of this album.Wiggins sounds almost bored with his material through the album, and never musters up a single human emotion until he hits the title track, ' Eyes Never Lie'.Well, my ears didn't lie, this is a bad album."
1,"Eyes never lie, and neither does mediocre music.","It is unfortunate that Dwayne Wiggins diplays none of the hooks or melodicism found on his Toni compositions. Grossly underated and taking a backseat to his brother Raphael, Wiggins few cuts always left you asking for more. The sophomoric feel of his first solo album leaves a taste of bitterness and longing for the Toni days of old. Hopefully, he will have more to share on his next release."
5,I love everything about it,"How can it be that the group on his production label (Destiny's Child, who is on Dwayne's Grass Roots Entertainment label) can sell millions, but Dwayne's own stellar album can't? He has a nice tenor voice, his lyrics aren't that run-of-the-mill R&B stuff that you keep on hearing, and the production is top-notch. My favorites include ""Don't Sleep"", the title track, and the Maxwell-esque ""Let's Make a Baby"" (co-written by Jamie Foxx [!]). And I didn't even know until I read the reviews here that the guy he sings with on ""Music is Power"" is Darius Rucker, the black guy from Hootie & the Blowfish. Though his brother Raphael Saadiq released his good Lucy Pearl project that same year (2000) and his decent solo album this year, I would recommend Dwayne's album over those two any day."
3,I Wished It Was More Uptempo.,This was a decent CD. But I was expecting for it to have more uptempo songs on it. For the most part it's laid back R&B. That's ok though. I just think it would have been a little funkier with more uptempo tracks.
4,I'd never lie about eyes never lie,"I too, thought that rapahel would bust out first and dwayne would fall by the side, but this album proves different. when i first put it in my cd player, i wasn't that impressed. but as i listened , i realized that this album was not only good but better than anything i would have expected. the songs flower,eyes never lie, dont sleep, get you groovin without you being aware. this brother is doing his thang to brain. all i have to do now is wait and see if lucy pearl is as good"
4,Good romantic suspense,"When Molly Winters wakes up in a hospital after a terrible car accident she doesn't remember who she is or how she got there. Worse, when she is told that the man in the car with her was murdered and she is being turned over to her estranged husband's custody, she doesn't remember him.Patrick reluctantly allows his wife to come back after her car accident. After she supposedly ran away with another man (one of her many lovers) all he wants is for a quick divorce. Unfortunately, he can't get rid of his feelings for her.Molly doesn't remember what she did to be hated so much, only that she wants to find out what and get on with her life. Unfortunately, someone is trying to kill her and she doesn't know who.Winter's Edge is a good book, but not as good as her others. Shadow Lover and Ritual Sins are by far her best. If you're looking for a quick, good read this book is for you. I read it in one afternoon."
5,Another Stuart Delight!!!,"Molly woke in the hospital to find she could not recall anything of her life, not the dead man who was found in her car, the 350 thousand dollars - nor the husband. This book was a little rushed because of being a series, and would have been much better as a big book, but it still is a very good read.Molly leaves the hospital to return to Winter's Edge, the only home she has ever know. Yet suddenly, she is a stranger there. She does not recall her husband, nor the various people in their lives, and she especially does not to know the woman everyone says she is. She does not like the clothes she wears, does not like the bedroom she supposedly decorated, and she cannot believe she behaved as everyone said she did. She knows Patrick, her husband hates her, but not why. And she does not know who is trying to kill her.Stuart delivers as she always does, just wishes this one had a little more room to deliver fully."
5,This was a very good book,"I really enjoyed this book. I've only read one other Anne Stuart book, but after this one, I wlll definitely ready more. As soon as I finished reading Winter's Edge, I started Meg O'Brien's Crashing Down. It is about a woman author who has written a book titled, that's right--Winter's Edge. Which by the way is another great book. I have several more Anne Stuart books and can't wait to get to them."
2,Um ... not one of her best,"Anne Stuart is usually a dab hand at romance writing, but here she (unusually) fails to transcend her maudlin genre. Oh dear, the old hackneyed memory-loss plot device. And am I really expected to believe that two supposedly non-stupid people madly in love with each other completely mis-read the other even through marriage? The heroine's character undergoes drastic change when she loses her memory (even though the book itself admits that amnesia does not bring on personality change) which is never satisfactorily explained. The plot is not only predictable, it is too incredible to work for me. Sure, romance is never realistic (by definition; life is not romantic) - but good romantic writing should bear at least a passing resemblance to reality."
3,14 extra tracks,"the first 4 tracks are the original EP.i fell in love with those songs.fast rockin' tunes with loud vocals.once i lost that EP,i looked forever for it again.this CD release gives me those tracks and more.the audio is awesome.i recommend this for the first 4 tunes,the rest are ok,maybe when i listen to it again there might be some others i like."
4,The Village By The Sea,"This feel good book is about a young girl who is forced to live with her aunt and uncle during her father's bypass surgery. Her uncle makes her feel at home butfor her aunt,that is a different story. Her Aunt Bea, an ex alcoholic, definately lives up to her title as a terror. Luckily, she finds comfort in a new neighbor and a magical place on the beach. As for the rest, you will have to read it yourself!!"
4,The village by the sea by Dan,The Village by the SeaBy DaniThe village by the sea is a great book written by Paula fox. The village by the sea is a great book about a girl named Emma. Emma is a child whose father is sick and she has to go to her aunts' house. At her aunt's house she meets a girl named Bertie and has fun with her. You will enjoy this book!!!
5,The Everlasting book,"This Book is excellent because i love to read this kind of books. The Village by the sea is one of the most fabulous book i ever read. Due to my life, i will never forgot about this book.Sincerly,Denis Yang"
3,Different colored type doesn't come through on iPad,"I purchased this book for my iPad so my granddaughter and I could read together. I specifically chose it because it had different colored type for each reader. Sadly, the iPad version has all the type in black."
2,Not for grades 1-4,This book is appropriate for preschoolers or kindergartners just learning to read. It is far too simple for children grades 1 and up.
1,Insipid.,"This is the dumbest book that my son and I have ever sat down to read. Perhaps the others in the series are good, but this is the first we tried - and we both found it boring and annoying. He's 5."
5,"Very cute idea, fun to read",My daughter and I read this book in one sitting. She loved it. It was right at her reading level (about 1st grade). We enjoyed spending the time together. Very clever idea!
5,very handy guide,Definitely a different book. I have just recently been diagnosed with lime disease and I found this book extremely helpful with learning about my disease.
1,Product does not slide,"I was highly disappointed in this product. It is labeled as a thin padded sliding short. Please show me where the padding is, because all I see is a double layer of fabric over the hip and outside thigh area. My daughter is a highly competitive player on both travel teams and high school varsity. These shorts would offer no protection in sliding circumstances. However, she loved how they fit and felt; they are very comfortable. As a compression short, I would rate them very high, a definite A+. Unfortunately, we need padded sliding shorts that offer protection to a player. These don't fit that bill, due to the lack of good padding."
2,a jumble of disorganized anecdotes,"this is a book that both benefits and suffers from extensive research. It is entirely undigested and frequently wrong on the facts. While the writing is good during the telling of each anecdote, the failure to develop any characters or for that matter a plot quickly makes reading tedious. A shame, because there is a lot of first-rate raw material here. The author just doesn't evaluate it critically, or tie any of it together."
2,Disappointing Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Release,"This review refers only to the MFSL gold disc release.There are some MFSL releases out there that, in my opinion, warrant the high price tag. But this isn't one of them. The sound is fine, but I didn't find it to be notably better than other versions of this album I've heard. On top of that, there is a good amount of hard limiting, particularly on the first two songs and the final song. Rush in particular is a band that benefits from lots of dynamic range, and it's baffling why an outfit in the business of producing audiophile releases would sabotage the final product by cutting the dynamic range down in order to make the CD louder.Steer clear of this one."
3,....Good album,"Big Rush fans and even casual ones will probably lynch me for this review. But I just didn't like some of the material. Only ones that are incredible are Nat. Sci. and Freewill. Sorry, but SoR is just played out. Not a terrible album, but not into it anymore."
3,Mediocre stuff,"This is typical worse Rush album full of mediocre songs. Only two first songs (Spirit of Radio and Freewill) are very good songs.There are much better Rush albums, if you buy this you might well regret it later. IMHO there is no sense to buy a whole album for the sake of two great songs. A disappointment."
5,another great album!,"great album beginning to end, classic rush,if you love rock n roll you should own this. as for the geek from new york who wrote what a horrible band rush is all i can say is get back to your village peoples greatest hits because you obviously arent a rocker! rush has stood the test of time for 40 years with no sign of letting up. all 3 musicians in this band are amazing and continue to tour and make people remember why theyre part of rock n roll history!"
4,More intellectual songs by Peart,"producing both ""freewill"" and ""spirit of the radio"" both songs which are very enjoyable. What makes this album great above all other things is Pearts skill in lyrics that shows in songs such as ""entre nous"" which gives a more advanced view of love than most musical groups. No rush album could be complete without a long 8 minute song which is found on ""natural science"" with strong lyrics and a message. This is not rushes best but it is good."
5,Great,"This is Rushes greatest album. Jacobs Ladder is cool, Natural Science is awseome and Freewill well what can I say its one of the greatest songs ever written. My favorite song would have to be Spirit of Radio. The first time I heard it was on the radio and I liked it but didnt know what it was called. The next day I got the Album. Geddys voice combined with Alex's guitar and Neil's Lyrics are awesome in this song. My favorite part are the hard riffs at the begenning middle and end.The Album it self is a master piece of music. This album was made right at the end of retrospective one when Geddy first started with the keyboards."
1,Retarded....,"Same old classic record company gimmick, re-release an already fine sounding cd/album and call it ""Remastered"" and ""Better sounding then Eva!!"", while charging it for a downright stupid price for a single CD. I don't know if this is band approved (i doubt it), but it looks like filthy rich record companies have no qaulms about milking fans into buying CD's they already own. I guess when the money stops flowing from from bands back catalogs they have to start pulling stunts like this...I don't think Rush would do this to their fans, I bet this thing isn't even band approved, official licenced, therfore Geddy and the boys get screwd out of hard earned balloons.Don't buy this sad attempt at a record executive ca$h grab."
5,Rush's shining moment,"A masterpiece of lyrics and music. Neil explores love, commercialism, spiritualism and more to one of the best collections of rhythm, melodies and individual musicianship. This has been my favorite Rush album for over 15 years (yes, even more so than Moving Pictures) and I never tire of listening to it. The metaphors that Neil Peart uses are priceless--""alone and yet together like two passing ships"" & ""genetic bends, with uncertain ends, on a fortune hunt that's far too fleet"" are two shining examples of many on this collection. For any Rush fan to not include this in their purchases should be considered a crime. Put the CD on, give yourself 35 minutes on the open road and you will thank yourself for doing so."
5,The best Rush album ever...and that's saying something,"This is my favorite Rush album ever. Natural Science is my favorite Rush song ever and the Spirit of Radio and Freewill are all time classics. The lyrics and musicianship of this record are incredibleNatural Science (which is even better performed live) was a slap at the forgettable ""New Wave"" music of the era and at the music critics (whom Rush has never been a favorite of) that by and large dismissed them, probably because Peart's individualism clashed with their own individual philosophies."
5,Finally cleaned up,"I've bought every available copy of this on vinyl and CD over the years in hopes of getting a cleaner mastering. This is the best yet. The noise floor is lower, the midrange is cleaner, the disc is punchier. Four of the tunes on this disc (Spirit of Radio, Free Will, Entre Nous, Natural Science) are as good as any recorded by Rush. Thank God we finally got a better mastering job. Well done, MFSL!!!"
5,A classic album (4.5 stars),"Consider this a 4.5 star review.Permanent Waves is one of Rush's best albums. This is a total 180 degree change in direction from the prior album, Hemispheres; the songs on this album are much more accessible and radio friendly. Geddy Lee's singing also started to be singing, rather than screaming, starting with this one. Even though this is a 27 year old album, it still sounds fresh and current. Every single song on this album is a winner (my personal favorites are ""Freewill"" and ""Jacob's Ladder""). I think the only negative about Permanent Waves is that you can start to feel the limits of Terry Brown's production abilities starting on this album (which is why Rush dropped him two albums later). Anyway, this is a classic album and highly recommended for any fan of good rock music."
5,Rush's Glory Days,"This is one of Rush's best (if not their best) albums. It's on par with Moving Pictures and Signals. All of the songs are innovative and energetic. Nothing boring here folks.This is the album that sealed Rush's hegemony in musical cirles in my mind. From 2112 to Permanent Waves. This is the epitome of their work. Unfortunately, later albums just don't measure up. How could they with an album as good as this one."
5,RUSHing to get a copy,"This is one of the best 80's era cd's I own. If you enjoy classic rock such as Head East(from Dazed and Confused ""There's never been any reason"") then this is the band, and cd, for you. They have been a consistent band since day one in both their songwriting and their talent."
5,<My Freewill,"Rush is absolutely by far the most sophisticated band ever to play music that never gets old. I have been a fan since 80' and I still get chills when I listen to there music. There are songs that make me just shake my head when I here today. I sometimes understand where Neil was coming from two decades later. I mean I get a better understanding cause I have either gone through or seen others go through, what Mr Peart was writing about. I am 33 years old now and when I was younger the music was pretty complex to comprehend what he was saying. But now it all makes sense better then before. I love these guys like no other band. I thank you Rush for existing all these years......"
4,Rush premanent waves,Product was refreshing to hear. Good to hear Rush and thier work. Its a work that is a little earlier than some of thier work. Still nice to hear the music was clear to my ears. Hardly any scratches of the cd.
1,Triteville,"Pettersen could be the next Ani DiFranco... except for her non-existant guitar skills, transparent lyrics, and meaning as deep as a fetus's wading pool. The recording quality is so horrific that the CD could be funny... but for the fact that the music is so utterly bad. The only good thing about this CD was that it made some very cool sparks when placed in the microwave."
3,Read for Class,I had to read this book for a class I was taking on racial and cultural minorities. I think Steinberg makes a few good points but watch out for opinion related text.
5,J.S. Bach for Electric Bass: Three Duets and Five Solo Pieces Arranged for Bass Guitar,"A wonderful book of Bach pieces transcribed for the electric bass. I'm a music teacher who is primarily a guitarist, but I also have a few bass students, a couple of them who have progressed beyond the fundamentals of rhythm, position, and left and right hand fingering.These pieces offer a refreshing contrast to the more contemporary styles usually associated with the electric bass guitar, and the duets are fun to play with students."
4,Excellent,This one is hard for beginning guitar player. However it can be worked up to so it provides inspiration now
4,Oddball Collection with some great moments,"This compilation of the Bananas spans the first eight (or so) years of their career, though it doesn't include many of their biggest hits. The ""cut-off"" point is the material from ""Pop Life,"" and this album includes the diamond-hard dance pop of Stock Aitken Waterman's ""Ain't No Cure,"" probably their most frothy and fun entry in the Banana's catalog. A few of the groups lesser known singles (""Robert DeNiro's..."" is one) are here, along with some interesting album tracks (""I Can't Let You Go""), and a handful of 'Rama Rarities. ""Scarlett"" has a nice bouncy edge, but the girls' vocals are pretty sloppy; ""Ghost"" is likely the worst cut, with solo vocal lines so flat that you can't help but understand why the girls usually sing in unison. No, there's no copy of ""Venus"" or even ""Cruel Summer,"" but there are more than enough ""hit"" moments in this collection to satisfy your average BananaFan."
5,Yummy - but not enough,I love this stuff but I was surprised at the size of the container. I guess I should have read the fine print.
5,Tasty Scent!,"This is truly my favorite Body Butter Scent from The Body Shop. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until right before they started carrying this. I only bought a jar of this because it was on sale for about 6 or 7 dollars on thier website and I thought I would try it out. Now I wish I would have bought their remaining stock because it is hard to find now.I usually like fruity or even flowery scents, but this scent is unique and not overbearing. At the same time it smells sorta sweet and the scent lasts nicely. I am almost through a large jar of this in under 3 weeks.I hope that The Body Shop will carry this again...and soon!"
5,very good....but,"My 14 year old Rat Terrier loves these dog treats. His teeth are not so good any more, but he can eat these fine. I understand they are supposed to be good for dogs too.Only one thing tho, a two pound box is selling here for $4.09 with $7.30 shipping, that is $11.39. Here in Florida, I can go to Winn Dixie and get two one pound boxes for $5.00.So it is 2 pounds for $11.39 or two pounds for $5.00. Do the math. :)"
4,good quality,The ball joint comes with everything needed and is a good quality. The rubber boot is thick and pliable as it should not rip and the bolts come with metal lock nuts not nylon. Its also about 1/2 the price of a brick and mortar store.
5,Moog K5335 Lower Ball Joint,"Moog K5335 Lower Ball JointUnparallelled MOOG quality that I have relied on for years, When I need suspension parts I don't look any farther than MOOG. I've tried other brands only to be very disappointed some were no better than the parts I removed.Buy with confidenceRagenRat"
3,the goose was cooked,"I was trippin' on LSD when I saw these guys in concert. I liked them, at the time. I was DJ'ing at WBUS in Miami so I gave the disc a spin. The phones immediately lit up with callers threatening to burn down the station. But these hillbillies gave it a good whirl"
3,Early 70's hippie music,"Spotted this as an lp in a stack of similar at a yard sale & thought it looked interesting. At first it seemed kinda ""southern rock"" but repeated audition reveals that ""mellow"" vibe of the most insipid Dead stuff & that it wasn't even as tight as old Dead. If you like that stuff, you might get a kick out of this, but for me it's too much a product of its time, too lethargic, and too hippie-feel-good. I'll take my bluegrass straight, no chaser, and I'll take my rock with at least a modicum of edginess, thanks!"
5,historical panorama,"this book although a fictional tale is based upon true events that occurred during the period 700 to 1200 AD and covers regions in Europe,Asia and Africa. There is enough information to cover the interest of any history buff and satisfy the lover of adventure,romance,mystery,intrigue and historical politics. The story relates the travels of David, the deposed king of Khazaria until he regains his lost kingdom in such detail and style that should hold the interest of any reader till the final chapter."
5,"Nice gift, well received","My college graduate great grandson requested this Bible as a gift. The book is beautiful, the binding excellent. His young eyes can manage the small print on thin paper even though mine could not.He is happy, so I am well pleased and happy to make a gift of such a nice product."
4,Great toy,I just bought this individual piece for my 9 month old to take on the plane because it is so compact. He seems to like it. I like that I can eventually add onto the set. I also like that the paint is non toxic and safe for babies since he chews on everything.
3,Your piolot's license,A great book for beginners. Helps you set realistic expectations before you even set a foot at the airfield.
5,Very Good Book,"Very well written introduction for anyone considering becoming a pilot. This book provides a short, but thorough, analysis of just about all that being a pilot involves - from initial training to life as a General Aviation pilot. Finally - a book well worth the money!"
4,A good review of the R.H.R . (The Black Watch),Great text but the illustrations are not up to the usual standards. The Author does a great job in the telling the Britains first Highland Regiment from being a sort of local police force to one of its elite regiments.
5,authentic indian in your own home,"If the mouth-watering photographs don't get you, the simple-to-follow recipes surely will. It breaks the misconception that good Indian food must be difficult to cook. The clear and concise methodology of the recipes is what makes it a firm favourite. This is also a collection of some of the finest array of dishes one will find in any cook book from the sub-continent. The fact that the book's author is not a professional chef means that this book is a true labour of love. So next time instead of stepping out for that curry... get this book and try your hand at a home-made meal. You will be surprised with what you may achieve."
4,the rices,the book was thrilling.i just know kids will love it.my son could not put it down.it was the first time reading for more than ten minutes for him.i thank the person who wrote this book.cade has learn to love books.
1,"Please, do not waste your money.","Listen, I bought this VHS for $17 and I was extremely willing to pay that much money for a VHS celebrating the life of Nora lam (one of my favorite people). Understand this, that no one in their right mind should pay $17 for a VHS but I did and was willing too under the idea that it would be a 30 minute to an hour long movie. BUT BE WARNED THIS VHS IS 6-MINUTES-LONG! 6 lousy minutes.....this is absurd but it's true. So don't waste your money unless you find this VHS about Nora Lam for under a $1. I was so dissapointed because I love Nora Lam and I wanted to see a movie celebrating her ministry but this absolutely does not! If I was given the wrong VHS or maybe mine has a glich in it please someone contact me...but until told otherwise and mine VHS is correct then this movie really is 6-minutes-long."
2,"Too small for larger, footed TVs.",Note the size of your TV and location/distance of any feet under the TV before buying this product. Did not seem very stable for the TV we wanted to use with it. Ended up abondoning the idea and now it sits.
4,Just what we needed,"We spent 5 days in Munich after our River Cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. We were so glad we had read over the Munich guide before we arrived. We constantly carried it as we walked the city, finding it accurate and complete--including where to find that fabulous Munich beer and weisswurst."
3,Acceptable replacement.,"Considering this is one of your only options if replacing a push button switch, it is acceptable. The pearl inlay does not match the original and the sound made when switching has a springy sound that doesn't sound original. That aside, they work fine and are safer than the originals. It's definitely worth purchasing these as replacements rather than installing newer style switches. I use them in my 120 year old house."
2,"The switch works, but it's cheaply made.","If you can find a better model, buy it instead. I replaced an older model Classic Accents push button switch (that had failed) with this one. I'm just not impressed with the design. Older push button switches in my house don't feel as cheap (when you press them down) as these newer replacements. What do I mean by ""cheap""? Wobbly buttons that don't seem to engage completely.To be fair, Classic Accents has fast shipping and the switch works as advertised. They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a 90 day return policy."
2,Classic Accents Single Pole Antique Reproduction Push Button Light Switch,"I was highly disappointed with these light switches. They appear very cheaply made, and paying over 20 times more than a standard switch didn't sit well to find that they feel and sound cheap. They are made in China."
4,"Not the best quality, but can't beat it for the price","I needed to replace one of these switches in my house. I didn't need anything high end - just something that worked and wasn't going to break after a couple of uses. This was perfect. We had the old one out and this one installed in under 15 minutes. The click when switching on and off is a little different than the other original ones, but the look is great - exactly what I was looking for."
3,Book Review of Love Spoken Here,This was a touching book of very short stories involving patients with dementia and Alzheimers. I was looking for a book to assist me in communicating with my Mother and how to keep her interested in life. I was able to glean a couple of ideas from the book. But I was more encouraged from the stories rather than obtaining tangible information on dealing with an Alzheimers family member. It was a good and quick read. Kudos to Turner Stimpson and his loving care for these precious people.
1,Disappointing.,"Well, the package I receive said ""50 oz. fill"" -- whatever that means, it was not nearly as luxe as the photos provided here! The outter shell definitely didn't feel like a high thread count. There was no damask print --I am starting to think this is the wrong product all together?It has not really fluffed up and is about the same quality as a shoddy variation I bought years ago and was attemting to replace. Not thrilled."
2,Not good,"These rolls are very thin plastic. Also, the roll is only closed on 1 side, so you have to seal the bags on the bottom and the side to create a pouch. (Maybe my roll was defective.) I tried several times to vacuum them with a Foodsaver brand appliance, and it would not vacuum. They did seal ok though, so if you just need to keep things dry and airtight (camping gear, comic books?) but not vacuum-packed, these are a cheap alternative to Foodsaver brand rolls."
4,good value!,Bags are very workable and are just what I needed and had put off for so long. Very glad to have found a great deal here!
4,"Great Book, Overall.","This book is a must read for anybody seeking to make a substantial - life changing - difference at home and in the work place. Although this book has some vary abstract meanings buried within its writing, the book stands true to pychology and scientific backing. Overall, the book is a great read and a must buy. It truly should be read by all those who wish become ""master minds!"""
4,Sonic Triple Trouble,"Sonic Triple Trouble is the Fouth Sonic game for the Sega Game Gear. You can play as either Sonic or Tails. When playing as Sonic your special move is The Strike Dash. Tails' special move is the Heli-Tails. Both charecters have the Super Spin Dash. There are 6 zones, and each zone has 3 acts. At the end of the final acts you will battle a Boss. The first 4 bosses are robots, the 5th is Knuckles and the last is Doctor Robotnik himself. You also fight Metal Sonic in the 6th zone. A very fun game, though not as good as the first."
5,Wonderful to Read Aloud,The text and illustrations complement each other perfectly in this amusingly gruesome but never too-scary tale about a man who wouldn't let his wife have any peace in life--or death. Just try to read it aloud without a bit of a mountain twang! What a pity that it isn't more widely known.
5,For the True Seamonkey Lover,"Let me first say I've been waiting to own this kit since I was a little kid and didn't have enough allowance to buy it. I'm glad I waited though, because it made me all the happier when it came in the mail yesterday.The black box with the gold lettering really was impressive and makes it the perfect gift for an adult especially one that could use some stress relief. The acessories are clearly displayed for you when you open up. And for those past non-seamonkey owners you have clear instructions to get you up and going.You can't go wrong with the 2 year guarantee either. Also, what woman or little girl wouldn't love gold?"
4,what i expected,Someone stated that it didn't come with great directions and they were right. Mine didn't hatch. I sent in the paper and got my replacements very quickly. Turns out the company is from the area I grew up in. Small world I guess. Anyway I will be trying them again soon. I have a friend that has very good luck with them and I will be asking for help. Oh and they sent me better directions with the replacement.
4,For best results,"For the best results, and the fewest headaches, buy a bottle of distilled water from the drug store and use that to make your sea monkey formula. Rinse the tank out with water, NEVER use soap or detergents."
2,See ya Sea Monkeys,"Since purchasing this ""Executive"" set, I have purchased another one at a local store. Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better. The sea monkeys in the ""Executive"" set lasted about a month and a half. This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague. We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them. The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months. I believe the ""Executive"" set is overpriced as well."
5,understanding CS2,This book is great to help a person understand the basics of CS2 and how the work. I would tell any body who wants to learn how CS2 works to get this book. You can easily go back to this book and refresh your mind if you forget something.
2,not for a beginner as described,not for a beginner as described. had more luck trudging through the help icon in the program.

3,Not as durable as expected,I got this shoes for a long time now. It looses his water proof feature with about 3 month of use. I found a little too havy even for a riking water proof shoes. It's not for running. But it's good-looking and very confortable.
5,Emotional Music,"A very unusual Phil Woods album. A great be-bop player, here Woods is playing over lush strings some of the most beautiful melodies ever written. Legrand plays some very nice piano in support. This album is for listeners who like to be taken on emotional rides to the heavens."
4,One cut makes it worth it!,"Images was an attempt to reach for crossover sales for Phil Woods and while it can be argued that even a pop-jazz version of Windmills of Your Mind by Phil Woods is better than most versions by lesser mortals, it still falls short - despite the Grammy notoriety. The strings are are just a little thickly laid on in this recording for most Phil Woods' fans. That said, the title cut Images should be in the dictionary as the example for ""Tour De Force""! Not only is the piano playing by LeGrand exemplary, but the ballad section is one of the most beautiful written. And of course, Woods shows on this one cut that all the other pretenders to the Alto Sax God throne are just that, pretenders. The title cut is clearly worth the price of admission."
2,Funky Rhythm Tap DVD,"I bought this DVD recently. Although the tap instructions, combos and routines are good, the quality of the DVD is very poor, like a ""boot leg"" copy, with very poor lighting, it's very dark. Given the asking price for this item, I was expecting top rate quality as I would with any other DVD. I also purchased another DVD produced by Rizzo and it had the same poor quality."
4,"healthy for life, the carbohydrate addict","I found the information contained in the books by these authors reliable and medically correct. More people should read this with an open mind and institute their guidelines for a longer, more healthy life. It is especially true for those who have struggled their whole lives with unending hunger and weight gain.I highly recommend these authors."
2,NOT TAYLOR!,"Not the real version, but not a horrible version either. It is ok, but I wish Amazon made it easier to find the REAL singles that I am looking for."
3,It's OK but...,For anyone living in secluded spots in the country think of it...this kind of terror can and has happened to some of them.I have a house hidden from the road where this has happened to me but thankfully for me or for whoever did it I was'nt there at the time.Now this is real terror when you are home at a secluded spot and don't know who or what kind of nuts are outside in your fields terrorizing you.That is scary enough and makes great scary moments in this movie.But in my opinion what distracts from focusing on this terror is the personality of the people and victims who live in the house.I see no need to go out of the way to show so much of what their personalities are like.(they are kind of nutty).I just though the focus on their quirkiness too much distracts from the terror.Its worth watching but just worry about the terror and don't think too much about the victims nutty personslities.
1,I can't speak to the content of the movie...,"...because I could never get it to play on my DVD or Blu-ray player. Defective disk, and from what little I saw of the movie, not worth the time or trouble to send back."
5,very suspenseful!,This was a good movie. I was on the edge of my seat! I think Cloris Leachman is a wonderful actress. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense instead of all the graphic stuff.
4,HIDDEN GEM!!!!,Cloris Leachman is so hilariously awesome in this movie! I think the last time I laughed so hard was when I watched Superbad.Acting and cinematography was excellent. Highly recommended.
4,Possible Spoilers,"CONTAINS SPOILERS This movie was a little gem. The genius was in its simplicity. There is tension, buildup, genuinely scary moments...and it's not some ridiculous monster or supernatural being, it's a bunch of crazy drifters. No one knows why crazy people do the things they do and none of it makes sense. The acting for a small budget film like this is damn good. Even Tara Reid, who I pretty much expected to stink up the joint is really good. Cloris Leachman really steals the entire movie, she plays a wonderful, weird and crazy grandmother really well. The filmakers did an incredible job of getting the setting (1973) right and attending to the smallest of details. I don't know why there are so many low ratings, I loved this film. Just don't go into it expecting a supernatural gorefest. It's more like a subtle, spooky, suspense. Not a horror film, but still enjoyable if you give it a chance."
3,Very odd and unpredictable horror flick with humor,"I give big stars to Cloris and the kid, to the location scouts, and to the story writer for something odd and unexpected. I never was sure who this group was supposed to be, since it could not have been the Mansons.I deducted two stars for some of the other actors and for that weird bit with the deformed woman and her grown kids living in the basement. No explanation for it."
1,Stupid Movie,Terrible writting and acting! Don't waste your time or money on this movie! Thumbs down! It was as entertaining as sharpening pencils.
1,I guess someone had to make the worst movie ever,"I can't review this movie fully because I was unable to get past the first half hour. It looks like it was filmed with an old 8mm movie camera, the sound track is inaudible. Your time is money, don't waste either on this tripe."
1,An Awful Movie - Nowhere Plot,"I admit, I purchased this movie because of Chloris Leachman,however, I don't think I could recgonize her well in the movie.It was a long, winding movie that seemed to lack a plot, or go anywhere. Actually, I didn't get through it, it was so lame and plotless.I guess I really can't recommend this movie to anyone--waste neither your precious $$$$$ nor time.Sorry I couldn't give a more robust review!"
1,...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,"Poor plot construction, pointless action, don't waste your time. Cloris has done fine work in the past but in this dud she didnt have much to do, other than yelling and breathing hard. I've had a more exciting time watching paint dry."
1,"Great acting, Recreated the 60's perfectly, then became really STUPID","The directors, writers, and producers took the time to get good actors and recreated the 60's to the last detail. That is where all the good points of this movie stopped. It was like the movie was on drugs. The long build up to a limp climax of what seemed like hallucinations was just pointless and not scary. The plot was wretched and pointless."
4,Cloris forever,"I was surprised how much I liked this movie. Cloris Leachman is wonderful as is all of the cast. I reject all of the reviews that seemed to dismiss her performance. This is a character driven thriller. I watched it three times in a row. The story in some ways is very simple, but the atmosphere and sense of place and time that it portrays is right on target. You feel like you are really with these people...just eavesdropping. And scarier than the cornfield is the visit to Leachman's sister and her family. I am ready to watch these wonderful characters again!"
5,Incredible,"A voice, a misery, a destiny. Freddy is one of the most incredible emotion one can encounter. You heard and were shattered by Billie Holiday, Edith Piaf or Elis Regina, you'll love Freddy. This record is the only one that exists of her. A miracle !"
3,"Good looking, sturdy, but wobbly.","I was looking for an affordable, adjustable lamp that I could set up on my desk while I draw. This gets the job done, it looks great doing it, and its sturdy. The only thing that kind of bothers me is the wobble it has at the bottom. It comes in two pieces, the lamp and the base. You bolt the lamp to the base, but no matter how tight you turn the bolt, it always wobbles to the sides."
4,Good Lamps for the Money,"Cute lamps, with lots of adjustability, which is nice for projects. The bottoms (I bought 2) a bit cheaply put together, but once they're sitting on the desk, no one would know. I'm pretty happy with them."
5,Excellent,"We ordered this lamp a few months ago and it has been fantastic.It is well constructed (metal), comes with seating options andis not too big, and not too small. It is heavy (for a small Lamp).We installed a 13- watt bright white florescent coiled lamp (notincluded) for 2 bucks and the lamp really shines bright.Love it. The only con I can think of is that it only extends about13 - 15 inches when fully extended out.Daniel James Tyler (The WJGroup)"
2,"Looks good, but it's really a cheap lamp","I don't know what I was expecting, but this lamp does feel quite cheap. The lamp doesn't fit well into the base (it's much too loose).It seems to function fine as a lamp, and if you don't need to swing it around much it's probably great, but I would avoid it if you need a lamp that you can easily adjust without fear that it's going to fall apart as you maneuver it."
3,Mediocre swingarm desk lamp,"Notwithstanding the fact that it looks very slick and my 6-year old loves to play with it all the time (Thank you very much, Pixar!)[chuckle!], the base is not as heavy as portrayed and the swing-arm action is very tight and its range limited. When one tries to adjust it, one really needs to wrestle it."
2,Could be much better...,"This DVD is good for little kids. The storyline is much easier to follow than if it was taken straight from the Japanese version (and a little more appropriate), but you sacrifice a lot of the good storylines. If you want the real story, go for the boxed set of season 1 and 2 DVDs, in Japanese with subtitles, or try the ""Heart Collection"" and ""Pegasus Collection"" DVDs. although they are seasons 3 and 4, they have the option of watching it, uncut, in the original Japanese with subtitles, or in English. I really wish these DVDs had been done like that, but i guess we'll have to wait and see."
4,Sailor Moon,"All or the series of the 1st one is 4 stars but the cover is aweful!!! Sailor Moon is a major (not minor) anime this is the best one of the first 4 episodes where Sailor Moon is awoken and she blasts the ugly witches that Jedite sends out are hideos expesally Morga, YUCK!!!!! These were great all except for the whining (minus 1 star). The Sailor Moon Cards are awesme so buy the Sailor Moon CCG!!!!!"
5,I love this version,Very cute and entertaining. Too bad it''s no longer on TV. Oh well this DVD brings you Sailor Moon in her earliest endeavors. Great Show. Give it a try.
4,"Only average, but a must for new fans!","Let me start off by saying this- Sailor Moon is great. But this particular DVD is only average. Why? Well, first of all, it is the TV version- not a good thing for most people. The voice acting literally makes me cringe. It's the best you can get, however- there is no subtitled version out currently. Also, the animation is merely average- chunky drawings, solid colors, not as fluid, etc. Yes, the storyline of SuperS (not Supers!!) isn't that good, but the animation is beautiful compared to this. However, the thing that saved it from 2 or 3 stars was the story. This is definitely the must get DVD if you are not familiar with the story of Sailor Moon. But again, if you know the story already, invest your money in Sailor Moon S (personally my fave season) or SuperS (for the gorgeous animation). (By the way, I may be only 12, but I know my anime and manga. I have been a SM fan even before its US release.)"
3,Cool!,"I think its good.If you like the dub,then this is worth your money.I'd buy it,because the episodes are good quality.If you are new to Sailor Moon,then you'll want this,because its got the first four episodes to get you into the storyline.The only complaint I have to make about this Sailor Moon video is that the front cover is very childish and silly.They could have at least printed a nice quality picture from the Japanese version,or even a good screenshot from their own Dic dub,but something that looks like its been drawn by a 10 year old is not on."
4,SAILORMOON is super cool,Ilove episode 1 because it tells how they becamescouts and I love thier episodes.
5,The Legend Begins!!!,"This was 'wicked cool' [in the words of Sailor Moon in a later episode] It features the first four episodes 'Moon Star is Born'; 'Talk Radio'; 'Slim City'; and 'So You Want to be A Superstar'. These are the beginning episodes where Sailor Moon and Luna work alone with Tuxedo Mask, in the fifth episodes Sailor Mercury comes in [but that ISN'T on this video]; so if you'd like to see what Sailor Moon was like before the other scouts joined her, come and see her in this movie that rocks!"
3,Sailor Moon in NA,"I like watching Sailor Moon, but I prefer the original. One of the odd things about the English Version of Sailor Moon is that in ""Sailor Says"", there were scenes that were cut from the episode. Here is the listing:Sailor Says EP #1 ""A Moon Star is Born"": There was a short shot from the cut scene which shows Usagi groaning that she is hungry before she sneaks into her lunch.Sailor Says EP#2 ""Talk Radio"": There were some scenes from skipped episode 2 which shows Motoki (or Andrew) teaching Usagi (or Serena) how to play the Sailor V game.Sailor Says EP#4 ""So You Want to Be a Superstar"": There was a scene which shows Umino (or Melvin) being clobbered by a roll of streamer thrown by Usagi (or Serena).Sailor Says EP#(?) ""Much Ado About Babysitting"": A scene which shows Natsumi (or Ann) carrying Manami (or Jordan). Then we see him urinating on Ann!I forgot what the other ones were...My favourite episode was ""So You Want to Be a Superstar""."
4,This Vhs is good!,"This Vhs tells how Sailor moon got her powers. It's good but i like vol.2 better, i like the other volume's better cuz it funny when Serena and Rae fight. But it is relly good anyway. The episods on this Vhs are ep.1 A moon star is born ep.2 Talk radio ep.3 Slim city and ep.4 So you want to be a superstar. If you are a Sailor moon fan you will relly enjoy it, i did. I also like the anime's Naruto, Zatch bell, Bobobo-bo-bo-bobo, Tenchi Muyo, Dragon ball z, and One piece."
4,Sailor Moon,"I first started watching Sailor Moon in Kindergarden and I still like it (I'm 13). I know some people only like the Japanese version and I have to admit the Japanese version is better.. But never the less I like both versions! In this DVD Serena(Usagi) finds out she is Sailor Moon and about the talking black cat, Luna. It has tons of laughs and I guess the fightings scences are OK. (The Japanese fighting scenes are much better!!) I truly recommend you buy this version or the Japanese version!!!!"
2,Great Show! Only one thing is wrong with it....,Poor image quality and a few gaps between episodes and replayed footage. Don't waste your money on this cheaply made DVD. Buy the tapes they're a better investment and have better image quality!
1,I would buy this but...,"It seems such good value that I have been tempted to buy this... but... having seen the fansubs, and the paltry few episodes they showed on terrestrial tv over here, I don't think I could bear to sit through the awful dubbing and the dreadful hacking job they did.I'm afraid I shall hold out until a subtitled version becomes available... if ever.I would give it more than 1 star, but I feel some redress was needed for the 5 stars it's got so far."
2,WHY??,This is NOT right! we get sailor moon S and sailor moon super S uncut! why uncut the end of the show and not the beginning! okay you might just want to save you'r money and get the vhs ver because its the same thing from it super cut and edited tv ver so unless you have a 3-12 year old with a dvd player wanting a sailor moon dvd than this is for them not the teens. I only hope the sailor moon R is not going to be like this.
3,Needs Moon Healing Activation,"Let's see: The DVD contains the first six episodes, and I got it for about... so that's about a dollar a show. Not bad, really.This is your basic set of family manga entertainment, with two sexy schoolgirls and a mad queen from the Negaverse. Queen Beryl wants to steal energy to feed the negaverse, but she's too lazy to do it herself so she sends some guy named Jedite (did I spell that right?) to do her dirty work. Of course, Jedite, clever as his ideas are, keeps failing thanks to the sailor scouts.My only gripes about this disk are that the transformations and phrases almost never change, Sailor Moon is a bad role-model because she's too scared, and Sailor Mars doesn't appear until the next DVD."
1,"No Japanese, No Subtitles, Bad Edition","Well, only but only if you like the Dic dubbing, buy it, but really this [stinks] because you expect the Japanese track, and the English subtitles and this doesn't have it, and the worst thing is the stupid edition that this company used to ruin this great Anime, so if you are a really fan of Sailor Moon I think that this DVD is not going to like you."
2,come on people....,"Great, we Americans screw up again....hey I love the dic dub and the japanese Sailor Moon but what are we doing wrong??? I know its how we protray them... the tapes show the first funny , great episodes but the Main thing that bothers me is the UGLY PACKAGING !!!!!!! Come on they should at least but the original LD Covers of the series... I JUST HOPE and pray that when Pioneer puts the S series on dvd that they will make the covers nice and NOT american cheap and childish covers."
3,moon freak,i realy cant stand usagi's voice in the dub. in the japanese its ok but it sounds like shes 3. in the dub amy and lita's voices r weird.in the japanese all the voices r soft accsept for taiki amara and setuna' i dont have the time to tell u the rest
3,Need orignal Japanese please!,"Selling dubbed and edit versions of tV shows and or movies is not the way to go in my opinion. I am saving my money for (hopes of) dvd versions of the oringal and R series of sailor moon; like what they are doing with the S and now the Super S series. Then you will catch my attention. Too bad Laser disc players are going out the window, otherwise I'd buy them for the subtitling!However, the effort is still there keeping sailor moon ""alive"" in the great big world of anime and into our homes. My cousins, whom are under the ages of 11, enjoy these versions and can quote them front to back. I think their favorite one is when sailor moon fights queen barrel (that volume). You have made many Kids happy =DHopefully if the sales are great and they know what people want, they will respond and say ""hey, maybe we should also put the first 2 series on dvd for our millions of fans!! (and maybe some extra marketing possibilties cuz no one is in a business to loose!)"""
4,"Good for beginners, but...","While this is the best chance a viewer can get to watch the beginning, be advised. This video is the first four episodes of DiC's dubbed Sailor Moon series.For those who do not know the difference, ignorance is bliss. But DiC's attempts to edit out cultural references and inappropriate material went, shall we say, overboard. In the original two seasons, before the so-called ""Lost Episodes"", six episodes were omitted entirely, and two were so heavily editted that they had to be combined into a single episode to get enough air time! Ouch!But otherwise, this is a must-have for any American Sailor Moon fan. The music is killer, the voice actors are great, and the action is second to none!Need I go on?"
1,Flavour lost in the editing room,"I have collected all Sailor Moon dvd's and This title is quite cheap and tacky. The episodes have been cut and no original Japanese soundtrack. In a nutshell, the flavour of the original Japanese version has been lost.All previous releases are very good indeed, all original and full of flavour, this volume and the ones that follow in this release are a true waste of money."
2,It's not the best,"Don't get me wrong for saying this. I love all of the Sailor Moon sagas. It's just that until Sailor Moon S came to the U.S., it's like it was adapted so it'd be better for little kids. Everything had to be right for the parents to let the kids watch it. That's pretty much why Sailorstars can't be seen in America, they have stuff in it that parents wouldn't let their kids to see because they're used to seeing Sailor Moon and the Sailor Scouts as good little girls."
1,Disappointing.,"I am a huge fan of Sailor Moon and Japanese anime. When I heard that they were going to be releasing the first season of Sailor Moon on DVD, I was estatic!...........Until I found out it only came dubbed. Sailor Moon is probobly one of the worst animes when it is dubbed. Don't get me wrong, the Japanese version is great...but when is translated, they turn it into a G rated show by editing out important things and changing around entire episodes. Some episodes were not even aired in America, because they were thought to be too ""riske'"".I hope, for the sake of myself, and many other fans, that Naoko Takaushi decides to release the series with a subtitled bonus. I'll be waiting with my fingers crossed."
4,Fred likes it!,"I was worried that switching my seed-eater to pellets would be hard, but my amazon seems to like it pretty well - and although it seemed pricey at first, a little goes a long way."
2,not up to par,I bought these for my teething kitten. They were far smaller then they appearred. He batted them around for five minutes and then wanted nothing to do with them. I don't know what catagorizes them as chew toys but they are far from it.
3,Just okay,"My kitties (4 month old kittens), do like to chew on these so that is a plus. But these get lost very easily and what good is that? I keep finding them hidden in some corner or under the couch. I give up on kitty toys!"
5,Adult passion,"I have always admired the passion and vocal control of Trisha Yearwood. But I never thought she'd ever get this real. To round up songs that reflect all the things you feel yourself and being open without giving everything away is truly impressive. Listening to ""Real Live Woman"" is like listening to Trisha's diary. But it never ever gets embarrassing...for me as a listener! When you get this piece of emotional art, start with ""Some days"". Let that message sink in and then start from the top. Be thankful for artists with something to say!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I don't mean to say I don't love Trisha's voice, but this album is full of bad songs. Out of all the tracks, I would say that three of them are worth listening to. You can't sing along, you can't tap your foot to the music, because it wanders and skips all over the CD. Save your money......"
2,Not Very Good.....,"I really don't like this CD very much. After Yearwood's last album, I decided I wouldn't buy anymore of her VERY BORING collections. The only thing that made me buy this one is her version of Linda Ronstadt's ""Try Me Again,"" which is good, but too much like Linda's (Linda's is much better, too). So, no, I don't reccomend this."
5,Back with a vengeance,"Coming off her weakest album to date, ""Where Your Road Leads,"" Trisha returns to basics on ""Real Live Woman."" Thankfully forsaking middle-of-the-road Diane Warren pseudo-pop tunes for more tried-and-true country songs penned by such writers as the incomparable Matraca Berg, Trisha offers up a more country sound than on her last two or three efforts. The opener, ""Where Are You Now,"" which was written by the dream team of Kim Richey and Mary Chapin Carpenter, is a killer. Trisha's voice is in tip-top form; loud and clear and expressive throughout the entire album. Her cover of Linda Rondstadt's ""Try Me Again"" is a sure standout, along with the Berg-Al Anderson tune, ""I'm Still Alive"" and the smooth-as-silk title track. Can't wait to catch these songs live, which will be tonight at Manhattan's Irving Plaza. A must have for Yearwood fans."
5,Trisha goes to new places,"Real Live Woman is a must-have for anyone who enjoys Trisha Yearwood's range and depth. This creative CD gives her an opportunity to go new places and demonstrate more aspects of her talent. Yet, the music is true to her style, so you don't end up wondering if you're listening to the same artist. Definitely a keeper."
5,I love Trisha,"Real Live Woman is one of a very few Country CDs I have. I'm so glad I bought this CD. Even if Country is not a genre of music that you listen to, BUY THIS CD. You will not regret it. Trisha's voice, the lyrics, it's all good. Trisha's music speaks to every woman on this planet -- and some men, too!If you've heard Real Live Woman on the radio and love it -- BUY the CD! Trust me, you will love it. But not nearly as much as I do. I just wish Trisha would come to PHOENIX!!! Please come soon!!!"
5,Simply the Best!,"I just bought this CD and I loved it! Trisha has the most amazing, powerful voice I've ever heard. I can't stop listening! :-)"
5,This CD is my inspiration.,I just purchased this CD. I fell in love with it. Trishais an inspiration to me. Sheonce again out did herself.I hope to be a good music writer some day and have Mrs Yearwoods respect.Thank youMindy Lawson Ellis
1,a big let down,"This cd really didn't have any notable songs on it. A couple of the songs had basically the same tune as some of her newer ones, such as Jasper County Line. She didn't really use her vocals like she is capable of doing. Was disappointed all the way around with this cd."
5,Trisha's Very Best!,"Not only is this the album Trisha Yearwood ""always wanted to make"", it's the album I always wanted her to make too! That she can sing ""Try Me Again"" and not make me miss the Linda Ronstadt original, or sing ""Wild For You Baby"" without making me miss the Bonnie Raitt version, is truely phenomenal. The fact that she chose to cover these two songs also shows what great taste in material she has. Trisha takes her place among the great women vocalists of the era with this release. It's the best album of her career. *****"
2,Not her best,"I am a huge Trisha Yearwood fan but this album is not her best. The songs don't engage me as much as the ones on her other albums. In fact, this is my least favorite and I love most of her other albums. Having said that, anything Trisha records is worth listening to!"
1,An expensive piece of Garbage,"Don't buy this! Does not match with most phones, and even it matches, the sound is extremely low.I called the tech support of this product and their comment on this product is ""lousy"""
4,Amazing Voice,"Out of the two disk CD, I enjoyed 75% of the music. Sebastien's voice is amazing and it needs to be heard."
3,Not as good as the first!!!,More of their own songs but it is more of a live performance than ROCKumentery like the first. Worth watching if you are a true fan of Spinal Tap!!!
2,Save your money unless you're a die-hard collector,"I was disappointed. Essentially, the video is a low-budget film of a Spinal Tap concert, with a few silly moments. The best parts are interviews with people like Rob Reiner and the Air Force base captain (played by Fred Willard). If the video contained more of those interviews, I would have rated it higher. Too bad that such interviews lasted only a few minutes. I liked the original movie, but I wouldn't necessarily want to sit through an entire Spinal Tap concert. Unfortunately, this video asked me to do so, and I respectfully fast-forwarded my way through 90% of it. Save your money, unless you're a die-hard collector of Spinal Tap memorabilia."
2,The Return of Spinal Tap falls short.,"This movie had a tough act to follow, and it clearly didn't meet my expectations. The interviews and short clips in between songs were the highlight of the film, but I found myself fast-fowarding through the concert segments."
3,We Have Returned....,"This movie was actually made for TV, and is not an official sequel, according to Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls, Bass). Which explains the ""made for TV"" look mentioned in other reviews.The Return of Spinal Tap has some hilarious moments, but is ultimately overshadowed by the original film. See ""This is Spinal Tap"" first, and enjoy the return for what it is... more of a very good thing."
5,If you like Spinal Tap. . .,"This is actually a concert video from 1992, filmed at Albert Hall in London. The group performs most of their ""hits"", both songs from ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and from their follow-up album, ""Break Like The Wind."" For actors/comedians, they are actually excellent musicians, and the songs are performed with all the seriousness they deserve. Interspersed between the songs are short interviews with semi-celebrities such as Marty DiBergi and Artie Fufkin, along with real celebrities like Martin Short and Kenny Rogers. I would have liked these interviews and clips of the band members at home to be longer, as they are tremendously funny. If you, like me, have both Spinal Tap albums and listen to them regularly, then you will enjoy this live version. If you don't care much about their music, however, there probably isn't enough humor to satisfy you."
1,Incorrect price!!!,The price of $46.00 is incorrect and is completely wrong!!!! This product can be purchased at Rite Aid for about $7.00.
1,not good!,"I have been using this for about a week now. Im an 18 year old male and reading all of the stellar reviews I thought I would give it a try. Well... all the way from my ear to my chin is a series of red bumps that look like pimples ready to break the surface. The funny thing is that I didn't think that it was that harsh when I was washing my face with it. I used the same lotion that I always do, my skin never peeled or flaked. Bottom line, I have stopped using it, and its been 2 days and I am going back to clean and clear acne kit. It may have worked for others, but I would not recommend this product at all, my skin has never ever looked this bad."
4,Control bad breakouts without prescriptions.,"I'm a believer in over-the-counter medicines as your second line of defense, prescriptions as your third. First is always what you eat and how you live... but no soapboxes here, just the soap itself.Benzoyl Peroxide is a near-miracle medicine, as it works for most acne sufferers without prescriptions. The only time you need prescription meds that use this is when the delivery method is (somewhat) more effective at delivering more medicine at once or making it work longer by adding something to keep it from drying out too quickly.However, most of us just need a good soap for the morning, after work, and bedtime. This is a little on the high side, but it does have the max percentage of medicine you can buy OTC, and it really does control bad breakouts. I wouldn't use it prophylactically, avoiding the risk of developing a tolerance for it, so the bar will last awhile if you use it during bad weeks.Fred"
1,to expensive,The cost will inhibit further use of this product. I had hoped for a bigger size bar at those prices.
1,Ehhh,"I've tried multiple face washes...AcneFree, ProActive, Clearasil, Neutrogena, and so many more. None worked. My doctor suggested something with benzoyl peroxide, so I stumbled upon Panoxyl. The first day I used it it worked great--my skin was less greasy in the morning, and some of my pimples seemed to have disappeared. However the next day, the skin around the corners of my mouth and around my nose got really really dry and started peeling. I stopped using the product for several days, but the skin still remained dry, even when I put lotion on it.Also, my face started breaking out in weird rashes when I exercised and sweat, which was irritating. I don't think this product really works well at all. My smaller breakouts have stopped, but I still have several monster pimples. It left my skin dry and irritated."
5,This stuff is THE BEST!,"This stuff is THE BEST! It is 4x stronger than your standard benzoyl peroxide cream. Apply only to the blemishes since it is so strong. Amazing results, most blemishes vanish in 1-3 days."
1,very bad,"gave my skin a rash, this is supposed to cure acne or to give you more acne? I do not recommend this product at all.."
1,USELESS,Do not buy this product. It's a waste of money. The best way to fight acne is:1. Stop eating foods high in sugar.2. Drinks lots of water.3. Wash your face 2x a day with a gentle facial cleanser.If you follow these steps your face will clear up. Don't waste your money on this product or any other acne product.
3,Too pricey,Always use this product just too pricy n I would not have got if they had in store. Won't buy this product from here again
4,Temporarily relieves acne,"It may be the type of acne I have, but this product was unable to clear up my acne. I had it for a while now, but did not do the job as well as I hoped. Also the benzoyle peroxide bleached a lot of my towels. Bummer."
4,"Gives me a smooth out surface, and flatten the redness.","i tried to use it on a mosquito bite on my arm, and leave my leg for 2 days. When used on arm it does reduce the bump down, and makes it a bit darker, but slowly fade. One on my leg didnt fade because i didnt use this and it stayed pinkish. Body, very good feeling when used. Doesn't feel like overused like creamy wash. I suggest putting water on the soap, then soap slowly on your body. It creates a foaming lather by itself. No need to rub your hands together."
5,A Must Have for Oily Skin,"I got this after I started noticing breakouts on my shoulders and also some on my face. My roommate had luck with it, so I figured why not. This is by far the best thing I've used to treat breakouts and my shoulders and face are all cleared up after only two days. My skin on my shoulders never dried out but using it on my face with other medications made it a little dry, so I put some aloe on to moisturize and also help clear up the acne."
3,Over Priced,"good product, but too expensive. not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much."
3,Sturdy,Our kids played a lot with this ball outside and it didn't deflate like the other brands we have. I will probably buy another one next summer.
1,"""Small, Small, ball""","This ball is so small that an infant could throw it. Please don't try to buy it for your toddler, the thing is just not worth it.disappointed![...]"
4,Not exactly like picture...,"I bought this bc my son loves to play ball - it was one of his first words. I really liked the size and the fact that it had the names of the animals so he would also learn to read / associate them. I was very surprised that it actually did NOT have the animal names, even though it did in the photo - and every other photo I saw of it (even the main vendor site). Can't decide if it's worth a return, but it does NOT make me feel good to know that I don't know what I'll get when I order something. I would have liked to get more, too... =/"
3,Not exactly as pictured,"I am overall happy with this small ball- purchased for my soon to be toddler. However, when viewing the different options available I chose to purchase a ball that included the names of the animals along with each picture. The Amazon photo shows a ball which does have this, but the ball that arrived only has the animal pictures, no names below each picture. Again, good ball and fun for my child, but not exactly as pictured."
1,GOES FLAT QUICKLY,"GOES FLAT QUICKLY. Too bad because it's a cute ball, fits little hands well, and the texture makes it easy to grasp. But a ball is not a ball if it become s a deflated piece of rubber."
4,Interesting And Fun For The Whole Family,"After seeing a preview for this I knew it was for me. To put it in a nutshell, SOS is an anime in the vein of 50's Scifi movies. Plain and simple. From the design of the alien ships to the look of the Sky Knight fighter jet. The ages of the characters are diverse as well, making it easy for anyone to relate to this series. To the adults out there, dont be fooled by the kids on the cover. Yes they are a big part in the first 15 minutes of the series but the adult characters get equal time as well. The story moves fairly well and even though its not nonstop action, the quiet stretches build the mystery and intrigue of the aliens and how to deal with them. As for the animation quality? Yes it could have been better but it wasnt horrible either and it actually molded itself well with the retro scifi theme.Overall this has started out to be a fun series and I hope it continues."
4,Celia's tribute to Mexican music.,"The idea of Celia Cruz having recorded an album of Mexican music standards may seem strange (or ill-advised) to some but the truth is that Celia could really sing virtually ANY genre of Latin music and make the songs her own. This obscure 1967 Tico Records includes such standards as ""Afecto Y Carino"", ""Anoranza Maternal"", ""Cuando Estoy Contigo"" and ""Regresaremos Al Amor"" (among others) and Celia puts her own inimitable stamp on all of them--which is all the more amazing when considering that these were all major hits for others. In any case, this CD's musical contents prove that Celia Cruz was truly a singer's singer and that her ability to get inside a song's lyrics and deliver compelling and spellbinding renditions (even of songs that were originally intended to be Mexican rancheras or boleros) was in itself a miracle. Enjoy!"
2,Disregard reviews,"Were it not for the daffy reviews of this trifle, I would have been still.How anyone can call this a police procedural is beyond me. Showing up in a squad room on occasion hardly makes it one. In fact it is the antithesis of a police procedural since the cops are part of a giant conspiracy which cuts our hero off from the normal cop procedures.One reviewer can't figure out who dun it,but it is early on apparent that everyone did it and that's the problem.Another nation wide conspiracy to do something unpleasant to non whites just doesn't sell.Just what will happen to almost half the population is never spelled out, but that's only a loose end.Not a particularly good book."
2,"A typical corney horror movie, but with a spark.","This movie is awful, but I believe it was made to be intentionally so. The scene featuring the baby trolls singing is worth a look, but there is little else this movie offers. Not a must see, but good for a chuckle."
4,It was great!!!I loved the troll!!,"Well the whole plot was great, the actors did a good job, and it was all around scary, it was kind of cheesy too, but i loves it, you have to love a fantasy movie about fantasy characters, like trolls and fairies!!"
1,UNACCEPTABLE FOR SHELLEY HACK'S ABILITIES,"The only reason I watched this movie was because it featured Shelley Hack in the cast. I have always thought she was cheated of getting the roles she deserved after her departure from ""Charlie's Angels,"" but this is the BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. I would rather watch a test pattern than this waste of time and film. By saying this, I do not mean to insult filmmakers nor fans of the horror genre, but even for horror films---this is not even ""so bad it's fun."" It just reaks...... I wish Hollywood would recognize Shelley Hack's merits and give her the roles she deserves. Anyway, where is Tiffany Welles when you need her? Where is our ""TIFFANY 2000"" movie? Tiffany would have stopped that mean ole troll with one shot! Although, seeing Sonny Bono sprout into a tree is just...well, I don't know what to say on that one....."
2,Don't think you'll still want to be a chemist after viewing,"Slow and pretty boring tale of a little kid who is possessed by a nasty troll and starts rampaging through his apartment building turning people into plants and making the atmosphere a little greener. A cross between GREMLINS and LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS which is just too boring to be scary and unintentionally funny at times. Sequel or no sequel, this one would just tie."
5,Where do i Start,"When i was 3 years old my father first showed me this horror movie. It freaked me out royally, I couldn't go into my basement for almost 5 years! But as I grew older and less scared I forgot about the movie. Then last night when we were at Blockbuster I found it, and rented it. It was a very good B-Horror Movie. Also, it had a very interesting methogoly for how the world started. Plus, you can see Sonny Bonno being turned into a huge ...!!! Which is alwas fun. My one grip about the movie is the sequel, is a in-name only sequel; A sequal would have been a perfect opurtinity to expand the methology.... Oh, Well. Rent this movie if you like a good freak."
2,troll is a creepy movie,i shall this movie on tv three yers ago on the scife network all i could rember is a little girl was possoed by a troll named torok that watend to turn pepole in apertment bulliding in to trolls and possening a little girl to get a ruond the aperment bullding withe out being nodiced i rember the troll torok was a evil nast troll i could rember a buch of trolls sing in in the bushes and i could rember a mad old women next door the apermen t bluding thismovie very scary to me but kind insreting i wish could so it on tv again i have int seen this horror flim for a long thime.
3,"Could this be Harry Potter, Jr.'s Origin?",Fair story. I bought this tape to add to my June LockhartCollection. Is June's daughter Anne Lockhart CUTE or what?
2,"Nice quotes, but not a vital reference","Although there are some very clever and interesting quotes listed in Mr. Freeman's book, I wouldn't characterize it as a ""must-have"" for students, diplomats, or politicians. Better alphabetical quote books are to be had on the market. The index, for once, is actually helpful, and there is even a section of the book that tells you (albeit too briefly) about the people who are quoted. I respect Mr. Freeman and his experience in the diplomatic corps; I just wish he would have contributed more anecdotes and examples from that experience."
3,"Fun to have, but practical? maybe not?","This is a nice book to sit down and read through at random, but it really is just what is says, a dictionary of quotes and advice. So I am glad that, seldom as it happens, when I have spare time I can sit down and glance through it. Is is something that I will ever sit down and read cover to cover? Probably not."
4,Comprehensive if Slightly Out of Date,This is a wonderful useful piece of scholarship. It can get you well launched into the literature on much of South Carolina history. Someone should update it but nevertheless it remains excellent.
4,A FOLK-FREAKOUT!!!,"If you could combine The Ozark Mountain Daredevils, The Allman Brothers Band & even The Jimi Hendrix Experince somewhat (Check Out Talk About Goose Creek), you'd have a pretty good idea what this CD sounds like!Fun album to get a good buzz-on too & help melt away your worries....Their others are a little more less electric & more like the Daredevils stuff (which the devils were obviously influenced by a few years later), but still great.Dig!!!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM STILL WILL LOVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK PERHAPS SELLER WILL SEND BY THE END OF THE YEAR IT'S ONLY BEEN 2 MONTHS
2,Dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed with this release. It was one of the first bauhaus cd's I bought, and thought it was really cool. I then realized most of these songs are on other albums, and the versions on those albums are much better. This is the one bauhaus CD I wouldn't recommend."
1,"DON'T BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS USER , HE RIPS YOU OFF",Ran memory diagnostics 5 times . Failed 4 out of 5 times . Computer crashes every time i turned it on . Then tried swapping it around but same thing . If you know the RAM was corrupt why on earth would you try to sell it on amazon ? What were you thinking ???
2,Do you feel lucky?,"Don't do it, unless you are completely color blind, what you get is not what you see! They fit small, go up a size or two and pay attention to length of sleeves or you will feel like a midget/ child wearing Dad's oversized shirt.. But if you enjoy the action of Vegas/ Carnival ring toss, enjoy, it's a gamble."
5,Best Espresso Ever.....,This is a serious espresso. 100% Pure Espresso Roast Kona coffee that produces the finest espresso you will ever have.It's extremely smoooooth and rich and not even a hint of bitterness. If you're looking for the best cup of espresso you just found it!!!!
5,Expensive - but REAL good,"These pods are very expensive, but the taste is incredible. Please reply to this review if you find better (seems hardly possible)."
1,Sorry Hawaii,"I grew up in Hawaii drinking Hawaiian Coffee. I have a Handpresso, either it doesn't work well with it or this coffee is too light, I can't get it like I get Starbucks Pods. Had to return it, my girl friend refuse to drink it."
3,Landis,Its ok if you are an absolut beginner but with as many as 50 pieces I think the variation in music and also difficulty could be better.
2,disappointed,"Ehhh, I'm truly disappointed in this book. It is truly for the very beginner and the songs are sub par. Many of the songs are very similar and just wasn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for something with more skill/technical. I would pass on this book if you have prior guitar experience."
5,A really fun book and cd.,"I was really suprised that the guitar solos sound as good as they do. This isn't really a instruction manual to the classical guitar, it's actually more important than that. The learning of these pieces in my opionon will help far more than most technique books since the man goal isn't to play the guitar, but to make music."
4,LEGO tries to come up with something to entice us big kids,"The LEGO sets I was always collecting were the castle sets, which I would combine to make not only bigger castles but more realistic castles. I have also been to the Mall of America were the LEGO store has wonderful displays of what you can do with thousands and thousands of LEGO blocks. It is in that spirit that LEGO has come up with the LEGO Sopwith Camel. This is not your traditional LEGO product; there are less pieces than you would think because they are so many bigger pieces. This is not a LEGO product (like their train set for e.g.) where you can let creativity reign. You pretty much have to make the Sopwith Camel and it is a pretty good looking Sopwith Camel for one made out of LEGOs, which means it will appeal more to the LEGO fan than the student of World War I aviation."
1,What a waste of money.,"It did not work. Before I even put the batteries in it, I could hear a loose piece of plastic rattling around. Sure enough, it would select the satellite properly but not the TV. It was packed properly, so it didn't happen in shipping.Mirriam-Webster puts it like this: an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. That is what happened to me."
4,Product review,Remote received within 4 days and working OKI have no more to add.I have no more to add.I have no more to add.
1,Letterman Store Should not be trusted.,I purchased a dish network remote back in Feb. The product did arrive before guaranteed time. However it did not work. I had a hard time getting in contact with Letterman store as they would not respond to my e-mails. I posted a review. That got his attention. He then sent me an e mail asking me to remove my bad remarks and that he would refund me my product. He sent me a bad check from an account that had been closed down. So not only did I miss out on my product and funds from purchasing the remote. I have now also been charged fees through my bank for trying to deposit a bad check. Letterman Store should not be trusted so please do not go through what I have gone through and end up with product that are broke and not even get your money back.
4,Dish Remotes,"After needing a useable remote for my 2nd Dish TV I ordered (2) remotes as I figured I should get one good one out of the two. They arrived in less than a week in a well packaged bubble envelope and even though they both looked well used, one works perfectly, The other doesnt work at all .I didnt recieve any extra or free one as others have stated. I paid $7.57 more for postage than what it actually cost them, So I would guess they make up for the low price on the postage. Still all in all I got exactally what I had expected and would definitely order from them again.A new remote through Dish Network with shipping is around $35 and even though it would have been nice to recieve 2 working ones, I do have one that works like new for a third of the cost.Kevin G"
2,I've seen better.,"I've played several sonic games(14 to be exact), and this one is probably the worst. It's probably the best one on genesis, but I don't have a clue what they were thinking when they made this one. there's nowhere to run or speed up in this game. in the console version, I used to dash through the loops and run down the spirals until time ran out. in the fist zone, the only place where you can even come close to having fun with the sonic speed that made the series famous is going down some hills on a rickety set of tracks in a mine cart. Infact, I didn't see a single loop, or any spirals, or anything relative to one. there is hope though, sonic chaos is so much fun that it's probably worth 12 copies of this game. the most important thing to remember if you want to buy sonic 2 for game gear is not to expect anything nearly as good as the console version, so get sonic chaos."
3,This is a REALLY poor remake,"if you are looking for a sonic game, get a genesis and get them. Better yet, get a GameCube and buy Sonic Mega Collection. In this game, sonic accelerates to top speed in around 0.7 seconds. Sonic usually takes about 3 seconds to accelerate. Also, the levels are VERY monotonous and boring and have no relation at all to the Genesis masterpiece. You are better off saving your money, unless you want a few minutes of fun in the car and you can find it for less than $$$."
5,It all started with Kristy's great idea,"Ann M. Martin is really ingenious!! I grew up with the BSC, I read them in 5th thru 7th grade and this was the late 80's. The first 10 books in the series are the best. I have learned soo much about myself and other things by reading her books. One of the many things I learned was to keep a journal. Also, her description of the neighborhoods in Stoneybrook where the Baby sitters live reminds me of my hometown where I lived from birth to 11 years, Lynnwood, Washington (a suburb north of Seattle). Whenever I'd read about the club meetings, I'd think of it being at my old house in Lynnwood!!"
4,The Baby Sitters Club Book 1,My daughter thinks its a nice book because it is very interesting. She like that it is about girls around her age. She can't wait to read the other books in the series.
4,Danielle's review,It's about a girl named Kristy who thinks the babby-sitters club is a great idea.Which all her friends love taking care of other kids.They think it will give them a chance to have fun and make some money.But nobody counted on crank calls.Now they don't think it is very easy.They say they aren't giving up until they get every thing right.
5,A good book for girls and boys who enjoy reading!,"Kristy's Great Idea is first Babysitter's Club (BSC for short) book. It's all about girls who have A GREAT IDEA to run a club! Fights,Weird clients,and boys don't stand in there way for a long-lasting friendship keeps them goin"
4,Fantastic For my Daughter!,I ordered these for my 11yr old daughter b/c when I saw them they brought back great childhood memories.She really enjoyed it and has read several since this purchase.I think she is on book 10.It was nice to share a moment of my past w/my baby!
1,"Uh, no thanks!","When I first read this book, I thought ""Wow!"" but after reading more realistic books, I thought ""Wow, this series is lame!"". If you like Dawn, though, pick up a California Diaries book instead (for mature readers--ages 12 and +)"
1,Okay when you're in 2nd grade,I read the Baby Sitters Club books when I was about eight or nine and I really enjoyed them. I agree with some of the other reviewers though. They don't depict realistic 13 year olds at all. The characters are very stereotypical and don't have much depth. The plots aren't very realistic either.
3,Ann's Great Idea,"The first in a series I recommend!Bsc is a fantastic series with lots going on and plenty characters coming and going.It could never be boring.Ann Martin will become a role model to me as I try to forge my path in writing....There is a problem though.The same things about the club will be explained at the start of every book in the same detail each time.Like,do you think that maybe Kristy once saw her mother on the phone trying to get a sitter for little David and then thought wouldn't it be great if mothers could ring up and speak to lots of sitters and then she got the idea of the Babysitters Club..???????You will be told all about this in almost every book!!But really should I complain??Put up with that repetition and ,honestly, it's a terrific series,and you'll always wonder what will happen next."
4,First official book of the BSC,"Kristy's Grea Idea, the first book in the BSC, it's a good book. I wouldn't exactly call it excellent, but it did lead to a great series of wonderful, exciting, books that carries forever frienship. It's about when Kristy Thomas comes up with an idea of starting a club of baby-sitters in the neighborhood. With the help of Mary Anne Spire, her best friend since the time she was born, Claudia Kishi, a friend from across the street, and Stacey McGill, a newcomer to Stoneybrook, Conn. and who is also Claudia's best friend, Kristy's determine to make it work. But things don't turn out as easy as the girls expected, business and adulthood is more then they thought. But no matter what, the BSC is sure that they'll make it work and nothing is going to get in their way, nothing. How will the things turn out? Read the book and join the BSC on their first official adventure."
2,Unrealistic.,"I read this book for the first time when I was 10. At the time, I thought it was great. I'll be 14 soon and I don't think it's so great anymore, it's just unrealistic. I've read over 100 of the books in this series, and although they can be funny and entertainin, there is usually nothing that would happen in real life. I would recomend this book for 10 years of age and down-ONLY. Otherwise you'll probably get bored."
5,I have been waiting for this on CD,"Amazon.com, THANK YOU SO MUCH! For those who have fallen in and out of love so many times, I promise you that the title song ""The People Some People Choose To Love"" will bring a smile on your face."
2,M.I.A,"Don't let the title fool you, ain't nothing political about this one, matter of fact, ain't nothing lyrical about this one. Mr. 305 keeps it miami cubano the ENTIRE album, dancefloor booty shaking track after track after track after track ..., after track.There's only so many times you can hear 'shake your booty mami mami' before it gets old. On top of that, the production is below average. 20 tracks, a couple of good tracks ( ""jungle fever"", ""Born N Raised"", ""Be Quiet""), but if you're looking for some good reaggeton, check Tego or Don Omar latest releases, this is strickly for the Miami scene, and then some."
2,Nitro Praise 5 really not as good as the others,"I've listened to Nitro Praise 1 through 5 and the best by far are the first three. CDs 4 and 5 don't flow as well as the others. They aren't as up-beat and exciting. Most of the songs are not bad, they're just not as good as the ones on the first three CDs. However, if there's one song I really don't like on disc 5, that would be New Doxology. When did Praise start sounding like angst-driven anger?"
2,not very good as the first three,the music is not as upbeat. New Doxolgy is not good. Nirtro Praise 6 should go back to the style of the first three CD's
5,Addictive...,I play nearly every night online. I'm a huge fan of the Age series. Been playing since the very first one. Easy to pick up. Fun to keep playing day after day... especially online. Having the ability to create your own scenarios keeps it fresh.Sad to say.. but I bought a new computer PRIMARILY because I played this game so much and wanted to get an edge online with faster board speed.Wicked good.
5,WHY IS IT A GOOD GAME?,There are alot of reasons so you dumb people that rtae it low probably never played it heres why i think its great.WHY ITS GREAT:-fun in editor to just mess around (no need to test map to have people fight)-many units that can make diffrent stratadgies-god powers are great-many mythical units that make the game unique-the Titans are crazzzzy-you beat the campaign? well download the new free one online go to the main website of AOM =D =D =D-beat every campagin that exsists? You can still play online make many skirmish wars and even make your own campaigns-many fun maps-can be easy or hard depending what difficulty's you choose so its great for everyone-new armies/gods/powers all that good stuff =]So basically this games greta buy it actually better yet buy the gold edition which has this expansion and the original which you need to use the expansion.HAVE FUN
1,Not worth it...,"Age of Mythology, the original, is a great game. The campaign is fun. The random map games are great.The animation is stunning. The monsters and units are well thought out. I would DEFINITELY suggest the original.**HOWEVER** I feel this expansion pack was not worth the money at all. I played with it installed for about a half hour (and used cheat codes to investigate all the new things) and then promply uninstalled and sold it. The ONLY fun part about it was actually getting the titans, but the atlantians are pitiful in the sense of buildings and units. I was very disappointed in it.If you feel like trying it, go ahead. But I would not suggest buying it."
2,Dissapointed,"Honestly, I am very dissapointed in the Expansion set. It was definitely not worth the 29.95 I payed for it. A campagn with 12 missions and almost no story line is NOT what I pay $30 for. I agree that the graphics and AI are well done, but my favorite thing about any strategy game is the campagns. They are what made Age of Empires II so playable, the campagns were awesome, and you almost got some history in them. I think a campagn based on the Iliad or Odyssey would have come out fabulous. But this....War Craft III on the other hand has several campagns ranging from RTS strategy to a sort of RPG. They did a excellent job in my opinion. I honestly think that the campagn for The Titans expansion was just not the bang for the buck."
2,Too long for low profile box spring,"It's way too long for modern, low profile box springs, which makes the bed look messy and defeats the purpose of bedskirts. But if you have a standard, high box spring, it will likely fit."
4,Best Bowl,"I have the 3 piece Pyrex mixing bowl set, but this is the largest one and had to be purchased separately. It is good for marinating large amounts of meat for grilling, huge fruit/salad bowls, Halloween candy bowl, etc."
5,Ideal versatile bowl,"This bowl is perfect for making chex mix in the microwave, which is why I purchased it. Now I realize how versatile it is for mixing salads or as a general purpose mixing bowl . It cleans easily and looks great for everyday use. It is great quality and durable."
3,Good Jungle when he gets into making Jungle,"Goldie's timeless has some of the best jungle tracks, with skittery breakbeats and deep dub bass lines. The 20 minutes of timeless are good, but it is very long and is maybe an 8 or 10 minute song stretched into a 21 minute epic. Tracks like Saint Angel/Angel, Kemistry, Jah, and a Sense of Rage are fantastic jungle songs that demonstrate to of the heap technique, but I think Goldie tends to lend himself out to too many other influences. The influences of Jazz and New Age are very hard for me to stomach. I like some of the pop vocals but at other times they are bland crooning. This has some very good songs but in my opinion is not the masterpiece of jungle that LTJ BUKEM and RONI SIZE/ REPRAZENT have found."
1,Completely Redonkulous!,"First off, I was fully prepared to appreciate this album being relatively new to D&B (longtime Amon Tobin fan, currently diggin' photek/teebee) and having respect for the rave reviews here. I guess I was caught really off guard by the super cheesy house-esque vocals and cheap synth instrumentation. I am hoping this is a highly specialized album for a niche group of musically impaired D&B listeners, not the ultimate representation of its genre as its touted. I would be embarrassed to have this in my collection in the same way I would be embarrassed to have a Kenny G. album while considering myself a jazzhead. Since when did shmooz become high art? This is anti-soul for those who know the difference and care; at least it makes my soul cringe. Thanks for letting me share."
5,"PHAT,PHAT,PHAT!!!!!!",I know it's a bit old but I just got this CD and it's one of the best if not the best I've heard thus far.
4,A Good But Not Strong Opening,"While the first five episodes of `Tsubasa' aren't perfect, they do a more than fair job of pulling the audience in. With wonderful animation, characters that are very easy to get behind and a story that has the potential to do very fun and unique things; this becomes a series worth starting. If you enjoy fantasy action with a dash of romance, `Tsubasa' has earned a fairly strong reputation amongst fans for good reason."
5,great series,I'm so happy I got into the manga. This anime was the icing on the cake. I love tsubasa! <3
4,Progessive in a new decade with a little metal touch...,Really enjoyed this group for a new wave of possible progressive rock influence that is much needed today as the greats fade away from the past.The recording quality is real good and a little hint of metal which is different and they tried to cover a wide swath of acoustic > hard rock on one album. Not sure where they are today and will have to look them up and check out. No doubt these are NOT wannabe's(bail people bail!) but the real thing of talent and imagination. Keep going!
3,much too small,"I needed a step stool not so much for my four year old to use the potty but mainly to reach the sink. I read all the reviews before I ordered it and reviewers said it was good for toilet and sink.when I received it I was impressed by the style and how strong it was but very disappointed at the heigth. My son still can not reach the knobs of the sink or be high enough to actually brush his teeth. I kept it until he gets taller but my father ended up building him a step stool that gets him up high to brush his teeth like a big boy.just be aware of how tall your child is and what needs you have for a stool. For my four year old, just not high enough."
4,Looks taller than it is,I bought this hoping my 2 1/2 year old son could use this step to get to the toilet and use the big boy toilet with the toilet trainer seat on it. But this step is shorter than his kids training toilet that with the lid closed can also be used as a step. He cannot get on the toilet himself and cannot reach the sink with this step either. This will work good when he is a little taller.
2,Not high enough.,"Yes, it is safe, but it is too short for my 3 years old kid to reach the sink or toilet. The step is only 6 inch high."
5,Great Stool!,We bought this stool for my 3-year-old son who managed to slide around all the time on his other stools. Our main concern was for stability and this stool addressed it. It has a gripper along the bottom which helps from moving on solid floors and a gripping pad on the top for added safety when he climbs. Terrific stool at an affordable price.
2,really short,I thought this would be a bit higher - I'm 5'5 but seem to be struggling to give my baby bath. wouldn't recommend
3,"ok, but too low","I was hoping this stool would help my toddler be able to wash his hands, but it's really too low. I guess this is better for an older child who just needs a little lift. I wish I had paid attention to the dimensions before buying. It seems fine otherwise."
5,Great product,"Definitely recommend if your looking for a ""step up"" for your little ones. I use it in the bathroom and it's the perfect height. It's very secure and safe with the rubber material on the top and bottom."
5,works well for potty training,works great with the babybjorn potty seat. no problems at all. very sturdy. easy to move - even my daughter can move it.
5,Still using it years later,"We bought this step for our toddler daughter. She is now almost 7 and still using it to reach into cupboards or as a podium when teaching class to her dolls. It still looks and functions as if new. Solid quality, doesn't slip or tip. Highly recommend."
3,Tips over easily,"I've been a little disappointed in this step stool. My son is 2 and just starting to be interested in potty training. One of his favorite things has been using this stool to get up on the potty by himself. However, the stool has tipped over several times causing him to fall. Last night it happened again and when he fell he got a small cut on his head. Today the stool will ""disappear"" from his bathroom. We won't be using it anymore."
2,Useless for Potty,I bought this stool for toilet training. It does not get my 36 inch tall son anywhere near the potty seat except to peer down into the toilet. I moved the step into the kitchen so he can use it to get water from the refrigerator. False advertising.
3,Could be a bit bigger,"Overall the stool is not bad. Unfortunately, it is not tall enough. My son is 2 1/2 and is considered big for his age. When he sits on the toilet his feet do not sit flat on the stool. The stool is to small to use at the sink. I am sure it will be fine when my son gets a little bigger. Right now, not so great."
5,great step for learning toddlers,"Great step. We paired this with the Baby Bjorn toilet training seat and are very happy with both. The step is sturdy and has a thick rubber top and base creating superior stability for toddlers learning to use the toilet and step up to the sink, etc."
4,very nice,"we really like this step stool. its sturdy and well made. my only issue is that its not wide/long enough. other than that, its GREAT!!!"
1,Not so safe,This product is not the safest step stool for kids especially little kids. My twins are 2 years old and we recently start using the step stool and the matching potty and to be honest both products are disappointing. This worked perfect in our guest bathroom where standing on top of a rag is well support. But my other bathroom is tile and it slides a lot regardless of the rubber underneath. Also the stool is quite small and both of my kids have fallen from it few times because they will step on the corner first and before they get the chance to put the other foot up they are on the floor. Before I even decided this will be a definite return my kids did not care to use it almost as if they were scared to go on it.
4,Great height step stool,"My daughter was about 2 1/4 when we purchased this. She was in the 75 percentile for height at her 24 month check up. It is a great height for her. She has no problem wiggling up and back onto the toilet seat (with Babybjorn potty seat). I bought this colour because I thought it looked more stylin' than the black and white but after a couple of days the white top was scuffed. Can't report on ease of cleaning yet, but if I had thought it through the white top was probably not the wisest of choices. That is the only reason why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars. Otherwise great height and seems stable no matter where she stands on it."
4,A bit pricy,"This is a very sturdy stepstool with good non-skid pads. I purchased it because it matched the Babybjorn toilet seat. However, I feel that it was a little pricy for a plastic stepstool."
