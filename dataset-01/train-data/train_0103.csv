3,Not the American documentary,"Note: This DVD is not the American documentary (""Seeing Red"", 1983). This one is about New Zealand."
2,NFL STREET 3,ITS AN ALRIGHT GAME. I GOT TIRED OF IT SO I PUT THE GAME DOWN AFTER LIKE A WEEK. TRUTH BE TOLD THERE ARE BETTER GAMES OUT THERE. JUST GET MADDEN YOU WILL BE HAPPIER.
4,science and stories,"I should love this book - I'm an oceanographer, science educator and storyteller, and I uses stories to teach the science of the ocean. But I find the stories in here surprisingly un-compelling. I do use the story of Raven and the tides,but I had to rewrite it a good bit."
5,"--good movie, I would pay to see it again","I think this is a very good movie. It is very timely, almost taken from of the news stories of today. It is a movie to be seen by many people with different points of view. I was surprised by how the movie ended. I didn't expect the ending at all. I do hope there will be a follow up movie, to see where the charaters go next. Actually I think it would make a great weekly TV show.I would recommend this movie to be enjoyed on a weekend night with friends. I would love to be there for the discussion after the movie. Thanks to Mr. Mercer and the players for a most enjoyable and thought filled evening."
4,Give Me Liberties or . . .,"Thought-provoking, enjoyable film. Is it ""the system"" that compels good people to do evil, or is it the worst of human nature that designs systems that cause us harm? Reminded me in some ways of ""Minority Report,"" where the all-consuming quest for security engulfs everything else."
4,LIBERTIES?,"Watch this film for its content but also for a really wonderful performance by Penny Perkins (and others). Tom Mercer has crafted a truly thought-provoking feature about the lack of a line (fine or otherwise) between civil liberties and national security. Nobody is either secure or at liberty in this really fine first effort. Independant film is alive and well, however!"
4,Nerd v. terrorist,"I liked the central character, a tightly wound computer nerd who has devised a way for Homeland Security to track the movements of ordinary Americans. I also liked the rogues gallery of terrorists, with their secret agendas of white power, no taxes, firearm ownership and religious fundamentalism. When your favorite terrorist puts your favorite government snoop in his gunsight, whom do you root for?As a low-budget, independent film, Uncivil Liberties pleases. It's not a message movie. It's a story movie, and you can draw the message you want out of it. I thought it was a film about what it means to be loyal.There is a certain amount of stereotyping; the fanatics act fanatical and the bureaucrats are bureaucratic. But first time writer/director Tom Mercer milks drama from the personal choices the characters make. Four stars. Worth a look."
1,The end of America,"I had great hopes for this movie, especially after reading Carolyn Baker's review. However, I must admit to being disappointed due to the amateurish nature of the project--in my opinion. The director meant well and his message gets across but the undramatic scenery, action, and acting don't make for compelling viewing. Sorry."
1,"Nice thought, bad execution.","It's true that our government's encroachment on our civil liberties under the guise of ""homeland security"" is a serious problem and an afront to our constitution. However, I'm not certain how this poorly written, poorly acted cliche-fest does anything to inspire anyone to right our government's wrongs. It was a nice thought, but it's execution falls short of the importance of the topic."
5,Good Music!!! and I think it is cool.,"I heard this album on my best friend's older-sister's stereo. She was playing it so loud we could hear it from ANOTHER ROOM! So we heard it and it was good. And, we yelled ""Who is that person playing?"" And Brian's older sister said its you guys. We thought it was a funny name at first, buy then I found out later how it was spelled."
1,died after a couple of months,I bought this battery for my old laptop. The battery failed after a few months and when I email the seller there was no response. Luckly I wrote Amazon and they agreed to credit me for the purchase price. I would not buy anything from this seller. What good is a warantee when they ignore you if the product fails.
5,This book was way ahead of its time,"It's a pity that this book didn't get the traction that it needed to get back in 2003. If you look at all the mainstream paleo books today, and the Gary Taubes clones out there, they all say that lard is good and vegetable oils are bad. It's a fact that lard is better to use for fries. It doesn't kill us, it doesn't make us fat. It's simply a better fat. If you happen to find a copy of this book, heed its advice, it may just save your life."
2,not worth it,"This was not what I expected. It was advertised as ""heavy duty"" but it was very flimsy and looked cheap. I was not happy with this product. I would have returned it, but for $35.00 shipping, it wasn't worth it!"
1,Weird size,"I ordered a small, and it was too small. I ordered a medium, and it was too big! I sent it back for a refund. This knee support does not match up in size with the supports from Target or the sporting goods stores. It is better to get one in your city, that way you can try it on, and take it back right away."
2,frangible product,It provides little protection for your knee. You have to wear other brace or strap to get necessary support.
2,Problem to recognize 1 Terabyte External hard drive,"I have a problem to connect 1 Terabyte External hard drive to this USB 2.0 PCI Card. It does not recognize it. It could find it once or two and shows as an external drive, but mostly it says, when trying to reconnect external hd, that one of the USB ports is malfunction. This is cheap and weak device."
5,Easy to install - works great,"Simple 'plug-and-play' got me going immediately. I needed three, but decided to order just the one to try it out first. I will order the other two for my daughters computers just like this one. Plugged it in to an open bay it was ready to go. I didn't need to install any software and everything that I have plugged in to it has operated fine. Prviously I had purchased an external usb expansion jack at Staples for twice the money. That worked sporadically."
5,Upgrade easily to USB 2.0,"The Sport USB 2.0 card for PC was easy to install, and it works perfectly. This was an inexpensive way to upgrade my computer."
1,no no no,"Do not buy a Buslink product unless you know you will never need customer support. They do not return e-mail, they have internimable phone hold times and they are unfeeling, unhelpful and cold in their enforcement of the letter of the law. Choose another company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,My boys Review,"I really like this book. The book told about the relationship of Martin and his siblings. It was a great book, and showed that Martin was a great brother."
5,A True American,"I give this book a very high rating, it is true,heartfelt and is a very good educational book."
5,A complex thought-provoking person.,"We found this DVD when we were visiting in Hawaii this month. We loved his music since we were first introduced to it three years after his death. Seeing the DVD rounded out the picture I have in my mind. It shows IZ as a person, portrayed by those who continue to love him. I enjoyed ""meeting"" his wife, his daughter, his ""adopted"" mom, and the friend who ""gave"" him ""Hawaiian Suppa Man."" I am glad we found the DVD. The only disappointment was some quality of the recording itself."
1,Not much of Iz Aloha,"I am a most ardent fan of Iz, I own every CD and the other DVDs- he is my favorite musician, EVER. I did not like this DVD. I did not get any sense of the beauty and true Aloha spirit that I have found in his music- it seemed kind of amaturish, and like they had to include every thing any one said just to stretch it out. I wish someone would make a really good biography for him- there was something about him that went way beyond the music and into the heart for a lot of us, and you just could not see that in this attempt. I won't even watch it a second time."
1,' NOT THE SAME ',"GOT MY FOOTBALL. THE AD WHEN WE ORDERED SAID NOTHING ABOUT A SQUEKER... THATS JUST WHAT WE GOT. YEP THEY FLOAT,AFTER IT FILLS WITH WATER AND GETS TOO FULL TO THROW. COULD HAVE GOT SAME TOY AT THE PET STORE.."
3,not sturdy enough,"delivery was fine but this item did not make it passed a week with my english bulldog..and he is a puppy!!! also, it is very heavy and hard for the dog to carry around..i would have done better with a small nerf for 4$..."
4,A watch made just 4 me,"I had to buy this watch simply b/c I am a female and my first name is Tyler. Granted, it's a bit large for my wrist (I need to take a bunch of the links out,) It's MY GIRLY WATCH and it's very stylish. Normally, I wouldn't purchase a watch designed like this b/c I'm quite active, but it can take a beating. My friends are humored by the fact that they all have TYLER watches now -and Roxy is a company for women, thus proving that TYLER is NOT A BOYS NAME-it's my name and while most of my mail is sent to MR. TYLER .... this watch boosted my ego. It's dainty, but not too girly. Rock on ROXY!!!"
1,Solitaire pendant,Wasn't what I expected. Was not satisfied with this. Too small. I need to look at other sizes.
4,A must have if you are caring for a person with Alzheimer Disease,"This book is definitely a must have if you are caring for someone with Alzheimer Disease. It is informative, helpful and provides creative ways to deal with this devastating disease. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is caring for a person with Alzheimer Disease or may find themselves doing so in the future."
4,36-Hour Day,"My wife read this and felt it covered all the issues she has faced with her ailing mother. We found a good nursing home, but need to check on her regularly in case some kind of neglect takes place. Very informative on the subject."
4,Great book if bought in earlier stages,The book was really good but didn't extend to the last stage where my mother is at now. Most likely this is because most people are put in nursing homes by that stage. I would have loved to have owned it a few years ago. Many of the things mentioned in the book were things we had to deal with blindly so it would have been comforting to know how to handle some of the situation's at that time.
2,So Disappointed,"Just not concise enough, and too small of print. I felt I had to sift for answers. There is great general information, but given in a mechanical routine manner. I just felt a lack of real feeling."
2,So disappointed!,"The print is too small! I ordered this book, sight unseen, for my elderly sister, who is the care-giver for her blind, Alzheimer-ish husband. Who would have thought that the publishers would have selected an inappropriate font size? Carol Clivio"
2,Not the best approach,"At best, this book is a guide to coping with AD for patients and loved ones who have resigned themselves to allowing the disease to take its course. It contends there is no link between nutrition and AD and makes no reference whatsoever to the role of silver (52% mercury) dental fillings in AD. Those favoring a more spirited approach may want to read Beating Alzheimer's by Tom Warren."
5,Definitely worth the wait.,"Thank you Vanguard and Amazon! A search on Sandy Bull produced this great cd, each cut an old friend that resonates and renews. Incredible to hear Memphis again after 30+ years, amazed to anticipate each phrase and note. No disappointments here -- Sandy Bull's music making has stood the test of time and then some."
4,A Good Read!,"Andrew H. Van de Ven and his co-authors, quite an innovative crew, have crafted a thorough academic model of the corporate innovation process. The authors use a river rafting trip analogy for the innovation journey, where uncharted, challenging territory demands leadership and cooperation. The river metaphor is good to keep in mind here, because the subject matter gets a little dry. The team found that common factors exist in every quest for innovation, and constructed a cohesive model for innovators. The material - resulting from 17 years of research at the University of Minnesota's Minnesota Innovation Research Foundation (MIRP) - is truly exhaustive, detailed and academic. Because of this, a reader with no background in innovation theory might find it somewhat arcane. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the complex process of corporate innovation."
4,Super Reader,"Arsene is so confident in his skills, he sends letters to the Duke of Charlemarche, telling him that he may as well have the goods he wants delivered to him, to save everyone some trouble.A master of disguise, this comes in handy when a detective that has been chasing him for a decade finally works something out.Lupin gets in trouble near the end because of awoman, but still has a trick left up his sleeve."
1,Arsene Lupin,The book itself is just a plain piece out of a copy machine. Not even mentioned the copy right and who is the translator. I was cheated. This item is an identical copy of the other that I purchased. Amozon should be more careful about its book seller. The seller did not even got the title right! And let us spent $9.95 for a junk in the same order shippment.
3,good book,"the concept behind the character is good.on the other side, his stunts feels kind of forced. essentialy, he has all the intelectual, moral and physical habilities you can imagine. on the other hand, his enemies have all the corresponding faults.and the justification for the stealing (SPOILER) is lame: he's avenging the society who wronged his mother..."
2,"Good, if you liked the 70s in Spain. Bad otherwise.","Si quieres aprender a espanol, este libro es bueno. Si quieres leer literatura espanola, compra Don Quixote. Este libro es un buen camino para aprender a la cultra espanola."
2,Not as good as hoped for,I listened to the tracks of this album here at Amazon and I wasn't real impressed with this CD album. I didn't find the music real authentic. It is sort of more modernized Greek dance music. Listen to the tracks and decided for yourself.
5,Wonderful reading!!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book! It's full of interesting stories and vivid descriptions about growing up in San Francisco's Chinatown during the 1930s and 40s. The author really gives you the feeling of what it was like to live in the Chinatown of yesteryear. I think this book will appeal to readers interested in historical Chinatown and to anyone who has ever wondered what was behind the doors next to the souvenir shops. For some this book will be a trip down memory lane, for others it will give them a glimpse of life in an ethnic ghetto, a look at life behind the tourist area. This book is a fascinating memoir, told from personal experience. Few books about Chinatown have been written by the people who actually lived there. I recommend this wonderful book to everyone."
3,"Teaches good thinking, but not durable","The idea is good but the product itself is made a little cheaply. The case hinges with just a screw and can easily break if not opened properly and gently. Also the pins wobble even if they're in place.This game is small enough to travel (and everything does fit conveniently in the case) but I wouldn't want to be picking up all the pieces from the floor of the car!Still, any toy that can get kids to use their brain instead of watching TV is worthwhile.Ages 8+ (but my kids are half that old and already get the concept--in time this game will teach them to think ahead in much the same way as chess, or even Connect Four.)"
3,Add a half-star for old time's sake...,"I just turned 67, and found this CD in a bargain bin for a buck. Couldn't pass it up at that price. I played it for my most recent wife, who remembered Rod's version of ""Jean"" and liked this compilation, even though ""Jean"" is not on here. I used to own a few books of Rod's poems, and the Warner Brothers LP's on the sea and the sky he did with the Anita Kerr Singers. Himself not much of a crooner, Rod still does a decent job on most of these tracks. A few songs on here are early career novelties I never knew about back in the day, but they are kind of fun, too. This is something we'll put on during a long Scrabble game (we have the double size version, so matches take 90 minutes to two hours.) If you ever liked him, and find a good price as I did, you'll enjoy this nostalgia trip."
2,The Words and Music are great - but McKuen cannot sing!,"I love his words and the music - he has great talent for writing and creating hit songs - but he cannot sing at all. It is painful to listen to his singing. I do like the man's poetry and other spoken CDs (The Sea, The Earth, The Sky etc.) but this is not something that you would wish to listen to more than once or twice. It is not relaxing or enjoyable.I was greatly disappointed with this CD collection - I think he needs to stick to what he does best - speaking poetry and writing songs hits for other people."
2,extension wand for Scunci steamer,"I had been using the Scunci Steamer using the hand held wand to steam clean my kitchen vinyl floor. It was a lot of work and I thought that the extension wand would make the job easier. However, the amount of steam that comes out as it is spread over four different openings is not strong enough to do the job I needed. We will use the extension wand for other purposes, however. We love the Scunci Steamer."
2,LouEva,"I have not use it as yet but started today to try it. First thing I notice was the pad was missing and then I notice that the brush for the carpet was so stiff that I do not think I will be able to push it.Sorry, I really needed it to work. Afraid to try now.Thank you for your attention."
4,Witty & insightful delving into the lives of American Women.,"A dated book, but nonetheless, a great read. Howard, a reporter for Life Magazine, interviews handfuls of women across the country while on varied assignments. Her purpose is to gather where women are out (it is the early 1970s). The author's voice comes out as original and educated, with the wit only a succesful NYC girl could have. No woman (or man) would take offense at the readings here ... but we can all understand better our current society by reading this slice of Americana!! Besides the historical perspective, you'll be sure to advance your vocabulary and have a number of hearty laughs. Makes me hungry for more Jane Howard."
3,Pretty but slip off my feet,"Very pretty on; however, even though they are the right size the slip off my feet from the back. Fit well in the front so couldn't order a smaller size. Shoe gave me blisters both times I wore it."
3,Odd fitting heel,"I walked all over the department store when I found these and there was no heel-slipping at all. I didn't buy them that day because of the horrible service so I came home to buy them online.When I finally wore them, I made a short trip from a hotel lobby to the restaurant on Valentine's Day and looked ridiculous trying to keep my heel from slipping. I bought these heel cushions that go inside of the shoe but I have not yet tried wearing them. They were just uncomfortable."
3,Very cute,Very cute shoe and love the heel height. The only drawback to this shoe is the back part of the shoe slips everytime you take a step. At first it felt like it would be tight but by the end of the first day it was slipping. I even tried a heel cushion but it still slips. Like the styles for Jessica Simpson and will buy others that have straps to hold your foot in.
5,ADORABLE! Love them!,"These shoes are HOT! I love the scoop on the inside by the arch...just HOT! They are higher than any other I have worn, but pretty comfy for the height. I think they seem to run a bit big...I always wear a 7.5 and was walking out of these, so I'll have to get an insert of some type."
2,"""New foil"" color is ugly","I purchased the silver foil and they were sooo ugly. I guess I didn't look at the picture close enough because I didn't notice the ""chipped paint"" look on the heal. Upon opening the package I thought they were damaged. Nope, that's how they're supposed to look. Ugly and tacky. Didn't bother trying them on."
4,Great shoes,"I bought the silver ones and they are very pretty compared to the other types of silver shoes that are out there. I usually do not wear shoes that are this high, I stick to 3 inch heels, but these were comfortable for a couple of hours. I wore them on New Year's Eve from 7pm to 2am. At the end of the night the edge of the peephole was hurting my big toe on my right foot. Also these run big, when I tried them at the store they felt fine but using them that night my feet started to slip out. I usually wear a 7.5 but maybe I should have bought a 7."
5,Red Hott,"I got these for my wife, it was her first pair of red peep toes and she flipped when she got them! She is small, about 5 foot 2. And her tiny feet fit perfectly in them. The cutout on the inside shows her cute little feet off and you can see the perfect amount of toe through the peep. She loves the way they look and feel. The red patent is super glossy, and the heel is slim and sexy. This is a great evening shoe, my wife just loves putting them on for a romantic evening out."
4,AMAZING SHOES!,"Good Morning! I bought these for my Birthday Weekend, and dancing with my friends. They worked wonderfully! They're ONLY a 4 inch heel, (surprising from Jessica Simpson), but they didn't hurt 5 hours into wearing them. I LOVE these HEELS!"
5,great shoe,"This shoe fits perfectly..I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments.. It def. worth the money and it fits nice, especially if u have wide feet"
3,loose fit and untrue sizing,I am a 1/2 size and when ordering shoes I am the first to notice if the sizing is true.This shoe has a very loose fit and is quite larger than its size.
5,Comfortable!,I love shoes and have many different brands. These are my most comfortable shoes I own. I have a couple of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are the best shoes I have. You get more than you paid for!
4,Jessica Simpson Joset,"The shoe is beautiful. I have it in 3 different colors. Although I like the black, the croco design doesn't show up as well in the other colors."
5,Very good effort,"While maybe not their most experimental album, it is the last great Tuxedomoon effort. The songs and the production is fantastic. I saw them on a following tour and they sounded spectacular live at the time. Here they manage to perfectly combine both the arty experimental side and the cold New Wave electronic esthetic of the time. Brilliant record, especially the first song Atlantis"
4,Great mix of quality pop and progressive rock,"In the Land of Grey and Pink seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. Don't get me wrong, its an excellent album, but its not what you would expect from a progressive rock group. Nine Feet Underground and Winter Wine definitely fall within the latter category and Golf Girl and Love to Love You is definetly catchy pop tunes. The title track falls somewhere inbetween. While I normally prefer progressive music, on this album the pop tunes really shine. Winter Wine is also an excellent song, but, as with many progressive tunes, you find that you like some parts of it more than others. In this case, the first half is far superior to the second. I normally like extended tracks, but Nine Feet Underground doesn't impress me that much. The title track grows on you but I think the surreal lyrics are much more interesting that the tune. Overall, its a good, if flawed album. It has some moments of brilliance and other moments of mediocrity."
5,"have to agree with the review two below,","but the extra tracks more than make up for it. That's all, this is a cool album, read other reviews for more, I can't be bothered to write a proper review, go ahead, give me a bad review thingy..."
3,In the space between good and great,"3 1/2Although the entertaining but hardly invigorating classic British progressive rock group rightfully wasn't able to fully transcend the technological time constraints more unhinged peers occasionally succeeded in, early work consistently grooved to offer a stream of very good material."
3,Wake me when it's over...,"This was my first introduction to Caravan, and I was really eager to finally hear them. It was not worth the wait. While all the songs are well done and the musicianship is quite good, the album is just....boring. Seriously, these guys make the Moody Blues sound raucous by comparison. ""Golf Girl"" is a silly song (not that there's anything wrong with that) and ""Love to Love You"" is forgettable. ""Winter Wine"" is a nice, mystical piece to fall asleep with. The title track is decent, but the monotonous ""Nine Feet Underground"" is unbearable...22 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Maybe their other albums have more of a pulse?"
3,DON'T MAKE ME HURT THE PUPPY,"Sam Walzcak (Mischa Barton) works as a demolition engineer in the family business. (Get it. Wall sack. Oh what a play on words!)She is contracted to take down an apartment building designed by the famous architect Malestrazza (Pascal Greggory). The building was made using live people poured into the concrete as part of the walls, the theory being it gives the structure magical strength.Sam goes on a journey of discovery as she interfaces with the creepy tenets and caretaker, only to discover that something isn't right.Kudos to a new idea, or a new adaptation of Poe. Unfortunately the film moves a bit slow. Cameron Bright plays a fairly decent creepy Jimmy. It is an okay film to watch, but is not a keeper. Characters fell flat. Dialogue needed help.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Brief sex scene. Distant blurred nudity."
2,"Creepy atmosphere, but bland and boring","There seemed to be a bit of promise with Walled In, especially considering the film's opening sequence and the creepy atmosphere offered up by the building most of the film takes place in, but alas, the film as a whole is a rather bland and boring affair. The OC's Mischa Barton stars as a demolition agent employed to research said creepy building for future demolishment, only to discover the building's (and its architect's) dark secrets and be obsessed over by a creepy teen (Cameron Bright). While Walled In does have a lot going for it, and Barton is actually pretty decent in the lead, the film just plods along in its relative predictability, until finally concluding in a pretty laughable ending. Still, the gloomy atmosphere does give Walled In a bit of redeeming value, but in the end, there really isn't much here to recommend."
4,Enteraining,"I am not a horror regular, but I found this film to be much more entertaining than most. It had some freshness and style and was not simply a run of the mill slasher film. These can be entertaining too if I am in the mood, and sometimes I am. This was suspenseful enough but had more ""puzzle"" in it than blood and that worked for me. I give it four stars for being adequate as a horror film but refreshingly different. I would not call it cheap thrills.Hard core horror fans should give more weight to the details provided by some of the other reviewers."
3,change of pace thriller,"i like Walled In because it is different. I am sick to death of all those torture-themed horror movies; they are so boring in their efforts to just out-gross each other. this is a creepy little thriller that never really let's you know where it's going. actually, it really reminded me of one of those cool made-for-tv ABC horror movies from the 70's. replace mischa barton with kate jackson or donna mills and there you have it. fun. recommended."
3,"So, So","The movie gets you in the begining, but as it goes on it gets kinda like, ho hum. I thought it would be better."
1,This movie was horrible.,"This movie was horrible.There was no chemistry between any of the cast members, and although the acting was okay, the writing was ghastly.It was about as thrilling as someone reading a cereal box onscreen. I wasn't at any moment frightened by the haunted ""architect"" or whatever he was supposed to be, I was just psychological bored. When I wasn't naturally asleep, that is."
3,Pretty Classic Denver,"This is a nice album if you are a big fan of John Denver. The individual songs are nice, but overall the album is lacking. It is really mellow and I don't feel like it has the energy of some of his others. It is very pretty, and well done, it just isn't deserving of 5 stars."
3,Could've been great....,"The playing is amazing, the singing is pretty good, and the album does, ultimately, satisfy, but this record doesn't quite turn into the gem it might've been. While the band is fantastic, they sound overproduced; rather than the timeless feel bluegrass generally strives for, the sound is very modern, and sounds far too clean to be something called ""Ancient Tones"". As far as the songs, there are some fair ones among 'em, but the originals fall far short of the standards, and we've heard those all before. If you liked ""Bluegrass Rules"", you'll enjoy this fine, but it's far from must-own for any bluegrass fan."
2,Nero Wolfe takes on Academia,"A rather simplistic mystery from Goldsborough, who attempted to continue the Nero Wolfe series. A Rush Limbaugh-like professor is murdered on the campus of a fictional Ivy League campus. While the characterizations of the leads was solid, the mystery itself had a very weak conclusion and left this reader feeling less than satisfied."
5,great remix by Clouser!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the first in my collection of type o singles, and I'd have to say I'd have spent four times the going rate for this jewel. The remix by Charlie Clouser (NIN?) of Cinnamon Girl made this, the third generation of the song, (Neil Young->Type O->CC) in my opinion, the best. Overall? Get it while you can. Type O couldn't have picked a better person to remix!"
2,Type O Negative - Cinnamon Girl,"This is a pretty useless single, sorry, but it is. Two tracks, neither of which are exclusive to the CD. I've never been a fan of Cinnamon Girl, I always thought the track was one of their weakest, and the remix is really nothing special. The edit of Love You to Death only detracts from how great the original, full length song is. Nothing new here, for completists only."
5,"""My"" personal opinion....perfect 10!!",To me this group is beyond words that I can express.As far as anything that they write it is from the HEART.And to me says a lot!So like I said before perfect ten!!And keep up the Great work guys!
3,good but could be better,"bloody good boot, comfortable and keeps the feet drybought the boots as they had a non metallic stabilizer and would imply that they would not set off metal detector, that was a bit of a waste of time as the eyelets set off the walk through metal detector.good pair of boots, stand up to punishment and look smart"
4,Rhyme & Reason,"Ask a diehard Zappa-band fan and you'll quickly recognize that four of the five members of Missing Persons are Zappa alums. So yes - the band is super-tight, disciplined, and bent. However, as another reviewer points out, there is an unavailable MP disk named Rhyme & Reason that, for my money, is the high point of Missing Persons' creative trajectory. Unfortunately, while the songs were pop (per the MP 'mission statement'), they had become a bit too sophisticated for general consumption and the album tanked. Now, you can't even buy the best album MP ever produced! Rhyme & Reason: The Closer That You Get - Give - Now Is The Time - Surrender Your Heart - Clandestine People - Right Now - All Fall Down - Racing Against Time - Waiting For A Million Years - If Only For The Moment. Snap it up if you can find it; it's a 5-Star platter of choice cuts."
5,Thank heaven for plastic!,"Any male who lived through the seventies-metal head to disco dude-that didn't fantasize about Dale and her ""bra"" was probably blind. Total package-killer songs and super hot chick that didn't mind showing some ""skin""."
3,Yeesh...,"I haven't listened to the remastered version... but I don't think that any person with some knowlege of just who these folks are would really call them ""sissies."" Although, I can't really say that their affiliations with Duran Duran and space music (Warren Cuccurullo and Patrick O'Hearn, respectively) are really strong testimonials to their artistic merit. I submit, however, that a band comprised entirely of musicians graduated from the tutelage of Frank Zappa could NEVER be accurately described as musical ""sissies.""More accurately they could be described as truly amazing talents playing music that is unfortunately judged by its heavily produced sound rather than by any underlying artistic merit. Listen to the stuff behind the production, and you will likely not find any other groups of their era with the skills that are in evidence here. This material isn't their greatest effort, but it's not a stinker either.And Dale's a hottie."
3,OK for the money; mis-labeled trrack,"Martinis Bikinis & MemoriesThis is an OK compilation aimed at lounge-music fans. A bit too heavy on the cuts from the Rad McKuen albums for my taste, plus at least one track is mis-credited: One More for My Baby is an Esquivel recording, not Perez Prado."
5,"Kubrik,s Gifts.","Kubrik, like most great directors knew if you cast a film properly the results will reflect such casting. George Macready and Adoplh Menjou are impeccable. This could be Ralph Meeker,s best performance. Timothy Carey, as one of the ""three"" has memorable moments. A superb film."
5,Anger and Sadness,"This is one of the best war movies of all time because it combines a true story with historically accurate filmaking and fantastic performances. The plot is straight foward and extremely shocking. An attack fails, the overall commander blames the soldiers, three are selected to stand trial as cowards, there is a trial and verdict. The action sequences do a good job of capturing the hell of trench warfare. The political / judical scenes are even more hellish. No cliques, no glory, only death and injustice. It is not so much an anti-war movie as an anti-government / class struggle movie. Do not see this movie if you want a rah-rah experience."
5,he's a go getter,cannot believe that this has been released in a package with the killing for under [$$$]. unreal. obviously one of the best anti war films ever. words cannot obviate the need to see this for yourself.
4,My favorite war movie next to Platoon,"Paths of Glory ranks up there with the top war films of all time. I place it higher than All Quiet on the Western Front and Apocalypse Now (which seems less like a war film and more like a psychadelic trip). Viewers must be cautioned, however, as the label ""war film"" is misleading. There is almost no action. There is a brief war charge that is not incredibly interesting or intense. However, dialogue and acting is what this movie is about, and through this Kubrick shows the absurdity of war behind the trenches. Those who run the war often cannot relate to the soldiers who fight it. This should have been a better DVD, however, as there is no extra content apart from a small booklet. The movie is great, though, and that is the most important part."
2,Great film; extras not worth price,"Love this film, always have, had a perfectly good copy you can get on amazon for 2.00. I 'traded' my old one in for this new 'pumped up' version from Criterion for 10X the price of the one I sold. What do you get with the Criterion version? A sort of entertaining interview with Kirk Douglas from 1979 on British TV where he says how much he liked this film. An interview with Stanley Kubricks Wife who was the german girl singing in the beer hall in front of French troops in the final scene of the movie. A sort of interesting interview with James Harris the producer talking about having to fire Tim Carey (one of the actors selected for execution), for being difficult to work with. And the most interesting extra, a brief news report on French TV talking about the original event in WWI that inspired the book & film. These extras aren't 'bad' they just don't justify a $20+ cost for this new and impoved version of the film in my view."
3,"Great movie, no subtitles","I first saw this movie when I was a teenager in 1962. It was on the afternoon movies on television and was played without commercial interruption. It was riveting. That was the time that I was first becoming aware of the sheer tragedy and scope of the First World War. When I saw that the Criterion Collection offered this movie, I bought it. I still love the movie and the picture quality was great. However, I'm now in my 60's and have a hard time hearing movie dialogue; subtitles help a lot. I don't need subtitles for the hearing impaired that also identify background sounds, I just need some help with the dialogue. I couldn't believe it: at this price, subtitles were not offered. I was disappointed that a company that bills itself as offering a quality product would skimp on such a basic feature."
5,Required for the Military,"I remember being shown a few movies as a young 2nd Lt in the US Marine Corps (such as Zulu) but this should be at the top of the list of required movies. This one will make you think, it offers lessons in leadership, morality decisions, obeying senseless and perhaps illegal orders, and the results that occur. It also shows the bond between warriors who have been in combat. From a historical perspective, it is very accurate, and shows the reasons that the French Army revolted in 1917 agains the generals. Would American fighting men have put up with this behavior? I don't think so today, and this movie helps to educate why soldiers should not blindly follow orders. In today's world, the general would be fragged. I only hope that if I were ever placed in the position Col Dax is, that I would rise up to the challenge as well as he did. I strongly recommend this movie."
4,Excellent timeless war/drama movie,"This movie made in 1957 and I saw it as a young teenager and never forgot it. Superbly done for its day and still good with some parts, riveting. Stanley Kubrick showing expertise with one continuous scene walking thru the trenches ---- perfect. Captures the French generals attitude towards their troops (cannon fodder). Based on an true incident."
4,One of Kubricks finest movies,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Paths of Glory stars Kirk Douglas, as a World War I colonel who defends three soldiers facing execution for cowardice. Their whole unit fled but only these three were selected (at random) for their ""crime."" The film's acting is incredible and explores injustices that have been committed in times of war.I found this to be the best Stanley Kubrick film I have seen out of the eight I've watched. The film has a strong anti-war message and really has an impact. Kirk Douglas makes a stunning performance and it remains one of his best known roles.The supplements include a theatrical trailer, a French TV program about WWI executions which inspired the film, interviews with cast and crew, and audio commentary by film critic Gary Giddins.This is an excellent film and should definitely be watched if you have not seen it before."
5,"""Paths of glory lead but to the grave""","""Paths of Glory"" is a beautifully filmed B&W movie by director Stanley Kubrick, and stars Kirk Douglas in one of his finest roles. It is a timeless anti-war movie whose message will not go out of style.Basically, 3 French soldiers are court-martialed to take the blame for a failed suicide attack on the Germans. Although Kirk Douglas commanded the men, he also defends them at the trial.Well acted by all, with excellent photography and direction, this movie currently resides at #39 on the IMDB list."
3,The story is lacking.,"Visually this movie is quite good. As for the plot it never seems to go very far. You have corrupt officers ordering a suicide mission on ""Ant Hill"". The attack on the hill failed and an officer branded the units as cowards to be shot. Three men were picked out and shot. I think this film is as weak as ""Full Metal Jacket"" which also has a limited plot. Kirk Douglas and all the actors make this an entertaining film, but the plot limits the film to where one would not need to watch it more than once. I consider this a companion to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", which is another film about World War I. The difference is though that the latter film has a very strong plot pushing the story. We can feel for those characters. I was also disappointed in ""Full Metal Jacket"" due to the sparce plot. Not sure just who comes up with the stories and all but I am not a fan of the weak and minimal plot."
3,"Adolphe Menjou, George Macready, Timothy Carey--all turn in excellent performances","The film itself, however, should have been better and left the viewer with a far more powerful impact--considering the subject matter.We have seen this type of subject matter handled much better by other directors.To me, this is really further proof that Kubrick was/is vastly overrated."
4,its a classic,"Enjoyable by all those with even a passing interest in World War I. Kirk Douglas is outstanding. However, some might be frustrated with the plot."
5,Great Movie about the futility of War,The movie has a very powerful message that many have written about in great length and have touched upon all of the important aspects of the films except the differences in format that exist and if it truly makes a difference in the overall experience due to the age of the film. This is an overlooked aspect of this movie because there are atleast three formats available from this site. having owned the DVDPaths of Gloryand renting the movie on Amazon's Instant Video ServicePaths of Glorywhich is a wonderful service; which I use atleast once a week;l I was surprised recently by the Criterion collection Blu ray version I was very impressed how much better the quality was and highly recommend watching the criterion editionPaths of Glory (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]
5,A different side,"Mikhail's books in an incredible collection of poetry. Her focus is mainly on the ideas of love and war and she addresses each wonderfully. The scope covers poetry written in and about her native Iraq as well as poems written here in the United States.The title poem, 'The War Works Hard' is one of the most moving and poignant poems ever written about war."
4,Sweet,"This is a wonderful companion book to the Anne of Green Gables series. This treasury book will entertain kids and adult-kids with recipes, crafts, information on Green Gables, quotes from the books and illustrations. I gave this book as a gift to my 25 year old friend and she has really enjoyed it."
5,A lovely book,It's a lovely book. It describes the life in Anne's time and I learned about it very much.
5,I will read more of Augusta's books,What a great story of the coming together of different people. Augusta is a great story teller and i will read more of her books.
4,Praise for Trobaugh,What a wonderful book river Jordan is. I enjoyed it as much as I did Praise Jerusalem. Trobaugh does a wonderful job on this story about a dysfunctional southern family. The characters are engaging and the novel is well written. It delivers an uplifting wonderful message about finding oneself in spite of difficulties and toxic people in our lives. I highly recommend this wonderful story.
5,"First read for this author, won't be last","This is the first book I've read by this author, but surely will not be the last. This author's descriptive prose and development of each character had me hooked from the first page. A wonderful, enjoyable read from first to last."
4,Well... wasn't my favorite...,"I was a little disappointed at the music on the CD, but that's probably because I didn't play any of the early games like Sonic Spinball or Sonic 3 and Knuckles. Some of the songs were really good like Knucklemania and The Sonic and Knuckles theme. And others were really not that good. So... if you're really short on money now, maybe pass up the offer on this one and get Sonic Adventure 2: Official Soundtrack instead, or if you're a real Sonic fan, and you've got some money, buy this soundtrack."
3,For Sonic Completists,"One of five releases in the now long defunct Sega Tunes series, Virtual Sonic contains some cool tracks. Named as 'enhanced' tracks from the video games, we get tunes from Sonic Spinball, Sonic and Knuckles, Sega's ill-fated Knuckles Chaotix (why was this not on the Sonic Mega Collection?) and a few of the lesser Sonic games.By 'enhanced' they mean that it's not music directly from the game, but given more life and wider sound by synthesizers too complicated for the original consoles.Some of the tracks are rather uninspiring, even if fun to listen to, but others have cool sounds and makes for good 'chill-out' music. An nice companion to the rare Sonic Boom CD."
2,YUK!!,"Whoa, was this ever crap! This is a cheesey American rendition and compilation collection that, quite frankly, SUX!! It's got two good tracks (return to the toxic caves and chaos jam), but as for the others, they weren't great. Infact, they're barely game related, they're mere compositions.! If you're a die-hard Sonic fan then get it by all means, but if you just like sonic (or the music) passively then don't bother!!"
3,"I love ""Turning Japanese"" but...","the quality drops off pretty fast afterwards. Some of the songs are decent. ""News at 10"", ""Waiting for the Weekend"", and ""Spring Collection"" show off the bands considerable pop hooksmanship, but the quirky humor that made ""TJ"" so memorable is pretty much absent in the rest of the Vapors' work. If you like new wave from this period compare ""New Clear Days"" and ""Magnets"" to the Cars' first two albums, and you can see why one group went on to megastardom and one to obscurity."
1,Boxer: Unintentionally Funny,"When Senator Fischer is asked, ""If the people can't trust you, who can they trust?"" I had to laugh out loud.This book is Barbara Boxer's opinion of herself. Apparently nobody on her staff has the juice to tell her to her face that she's probably the least intelligent senator in a room full of not-so-luminaries, all convinced they should be the president of the United States.Keep churning 'em out, Babs. Each tome is a window to your self-congratulatory soul."
4,Much better than I expected,"I was a bit surprised at how much I ended up liking this book. I bought it as a ""bargain book"" and got more than my money's worth.I wasn't expecting much. It started out a bit too much like ""chick-lit"" or romance (all about relationships, too cute, when protagonists were young). In fact, I put the book down.I'm glad, however, that I picked it up again. The closer it got to the Senatorial election, the more that went down (especially in the last few pages) in the halls of the Capitol, the more I liked the book.Therefore, I recommend the book without reservation, but just caution you to be patient with the beginning. Your patience will be rewarded."
1,Excerpt from book,"Her skirt was very short, and Josh found himself mesmerized by her perfectly shaped, silken legs with kneecaps that reminded him of golden apples.excerpt from Sen. Barbara Boxer's (D-California) novel A Time to Run"
2,Was this even EDITED?,"The book was frustrating and a total waste of time, (and money). It needs to be edited by a professional editor. The grammar is the WORST I have ever seen in a published book, the metaphors are hilarious in that they are so 'over-the-top' Either this book was not edited at all or her editor hates her!"
1,Barbara Boxer can't write -- and neither can her ghost writer,"This isn't Barbara Boxer's book. It was written by Mary-Rose Hayes, whose prior works are a string of cheesy romance novels that went straight to out-of-print.The prose is appalling. The characters are caricatures. The most famous scene, the horse sex scene, is pointless. The plot is, shall we say, less than riveting.Barbara Boxer is known as the dumbest woman in the Senate. By hiring such a washed-up hack to ghost-write her book, she's proved it."
2,Writing worthy of a high school senior who's trying too hard,"While reading this book, I'm reminded of a high school English class where we tried to impress each other by reaching for words and descriptive phrases, but we would wind up cluttering the ideas in a blob of words. The senator tries to be eloquent but it comes off to me as forced and melodramatic. I'm only half way through because I can only stand reading it ten pages at a time."
2,pretty average,walking on sunshine was catchy but that's the Problem with some of these songs more catchier than overall good.Katrina&the waves were pretty much a time period thing.but that's as Good as it gets with them.
5,And don't it feel good...,"There's more to Katrina and the Waves than ""Walking On Sunshine, though that song alone puts them in the pantheon of power pop. Katrina has a great big powerful soul voice and The Waves were a tight and funky little oufit. Kimberly Rew is one of the least heralded guitarists out there but his playing is impeccable and his songwriting is a force to be reckoned with. The Waves first two albums were their best and Anthology wisely cherry picks the best of those two records. ""Sunshine"", ""Going Down To Liverpool"", ""Que Te Quiero"", and ""Is That It?"" are perfect little gems from a decade that had little else to reccomend it.Get this and get put some sunshine in your CD tray."
3,Previous Knowledge of Britsh History a Must...,"Entertaining and enlightening, but confusing if you know nothing about British history. Elizabeth becomes much more understandable and personable."
3,Its good but.....,"I was very excited to receive this book, and read it in a few days. The book gives thorough details of Jamaican history, the Rastafarian religion, and Marley's family. But what the book is lacking is emotion and heart. The author speeds through the end of Bob's life and commercial success. It didn't really touch on how much Bob's music affected people. Overall, I think it was a good book, but I wish that I had bought Spirit Dancer. I heard that that book is better."
5,Very enlightening,"This book on Marley is much more thorough than others out there. It gives historical and musical insights besides giving you a really inside sense of Marley the person. You learn about his childhood, his time as a teenager and adult, the family, the politics and lifestyles of the Jamaicans, and also cool info on how all the Wailers songs got created. The part on Peter Tosh's death is SCARY. And in the back is stuff on court cases, CIA documents, and a king-size disc history that helps to find usual records. This book has loads in it. It definitely requires concentration but it stays with you afterward."
4,THE LIFE OF BOB MARLEY: A MUST HAVE BOOK,If your into Bob Marley this is a must have book. You will love this book and get hooked on it and won't want to stop reading it. This is a heartpounding book that explains the time period that he lived in and how he made a big impact on the whole world with his music and his attitude towards life. So go to your nearest book store and purchase your book today!xoxo rhino
4,Fascinating work from rock's premier journalist,"One of the better music biographies I have ever read. I knew a bit about Marley and his music before picking this up (and the 1998 edition is the most up-to-date), but this really clued me in. And I, unlike some readers, appreciated the solid background on Jamaica, reggae, and Rastafarianism, all of which are essential to understanding Bob Marley. I would have liked more anecdotes, stories, and information about his recording and touring (patriculary during the late '70s heydey), but White mysteriously does not delve much into this. And it did what a good music bio should - further investigate and listen to the music of the subject. Jah, mon!"
5,Great Look at Marley and Reggae,"A fascinating study of the legendary Bob Marley. My other favorite world music book is ""The Brazilian Sound"" (Temple University Press, 1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com."
2,disappointment,"This book talks too much about everyone associated with Bob Marley; Halassie Salassie, Marcus Garvey, Rita Marley (and countless other extraneous characters), and too little about Bob Marley. Although there were rare moments when I caught a quick glimpse of Bob Marley, I finished this book with no clear image of him.The author's implication that Bob Marley possessed supernatural powers is silly, and cheapens his memory. Bob Marley was an artist who overcame great odds as a result of talent, determination, and idealistic conviction. Yet I did not find this Bob Marley in this book."
1,CONDESCENDING AND UNCONVINCING,"Are you looking for a well-written, factual and insightful book about Bob Marley and reggae? Well don't buy this book, which no intelligent reader could take seriously. It attributes magical supernatural obeah powers to Marley, recounts chilhood occurances in his life as if the author had been there, and tries to imply that the CIA might somehow have been involved in an attempt on his life. Would White have written such nonsense about Bob Dylan or John Lennon? I doubt it. This book is simply an insult to the man's memory and to his music."
1,Worst Book EVER,"After going to Jamaica, and actually visting Bob Marley's home and tomb, I wanted to read more about his life. What I got was the worst written book I have ever read. The author jumps around so much I couldn't keep up. He mentions so many people, names, and dates my head was spinning. This book was not about Bob Marley- this was more about the politics going on at the time. I was looking for a book that told of Bob's life; his family, his relationship with his wife, his kids. This was not the book that I was looking for."
2,Well written book with too little information about Bob.,"This book, Catch a Fire, was a very well thought out book. However, it gave more of a summary of the history of Jamaica rather than talking about Bob Marley and Reggae Music. The book gave too much information on the history of Rastafarianism and Jamaica. Timothy White did a sufficient amount of research on Bob Marley through his interviews with relatives, but did not tie enough of the information about the man himself into the book. Overall, a good book for learning about Jamaican culture and a small amount of Regae history."
4,White Working Class,"If you want to know who these white working class citizens against President Obama are, you should read William Faulkner's Barn Burning. Faulkner takes the reader into a community that is often ignored with great literary skill. The white working class is a group that live a life that is as unstable as an urban black community. Barn Burning is a story about the desperation, bitterness, and destruction of the working poor. Of course the concept of working poor is oxymoronic. If a person works, they should not be poor. Faulkner does not leave the reader in a negative emotional state, Barn Burning has an endearing hero. What Tupac would call a rose sprouting up from the concrete. The best part about Barn Burning is that it is a short story, for those lazy readers. After watching Obama's response to the mid-term elections, I would suggest that he read William Faulkner's Barn Burning."
3,"Good service, but...","I would say that your service is fantastically good.But, it seem to be not worth the value to have this book in the price which is very high for me.I mean the price for the shipping, it is double the price of this book!Probably you could reduce your shipping fee in the future time."
3,Milenio: Hard to read,"For me, one of the biggest deciding factors between a good text book and a bad one is readablilty. This book is terribly hard to read. It's not in the language, but rather, how the pages are layed out. Each page has two columns of about 8 to 10 point-sized text. There is absolutely NO break in the text. I find this layout very hard to read. Also, many of the longer works are ""abridged."" There are tons of (...)s between parts of text. For me, this makes some of the stories hard to understand. If you are a teacher considering using this book, do your students a favor, and DON'T. If you are a student buying this book for class, good luck!"
4,A ton of Spanish literature - excellent for introductions,"This book is excellent for the classes that are introduction to Spanish literature. I wish I would have known about this book several years ago before I put myself through all that torture of learning on my own. With this book, I was able to learn reasons why certain pieces of literature were written, what was going on in Spain during certain time periods."
4,go ask alice...circa 1970's,This album is good physchodelic fun. I remember the Circus magazine that had a group picture that looked like their eyes would follow you...I think 1968 or 69..dont remember. DOA should have been included in the mini-movie Go Ask Alice....
4,"Old, new, rockin' and blues","Being a big fan of the 70's I was very surprised to discover-thanks to amazon-a band that I had never heard of before.A good discovery!Bloodrock's music has all the ingredients that makes the 70's bands so great:hard-rock-blues, heavy guitars and long solos, hammond keyboard and the unique 70's sound.Somewhere in between Blue Oyster Cult, Birth Control, Deep purple or Grand Funk, Bloodrock provides a classic hard rock, far from being uninterresting.D.O.A., Lucky in the morning or Fallin' are good examples of rich, powerful and diversified songs.Listening to this album-the only Bloodrock I've heard so far-surelly gives me the will to purchase some more.Ain't that great to discover a ""new"" band from the 70's!?"
5,Information about this album!,"The second BLOODROCK album scored the surprising AM radio hit ""D.O.A. despite it's brooding heavy rock sound with death lyrics about a plane crash...Here you get the long unedited version with all the sound effects and chilling dark atmosphere throughout. That's just the start on this really strong BLOODROCKER who hit hard on tracks like ""Lucky In The Morning"" and ""Dier Not Lover"" ... the Texan band teamed up on many a tour with Grand Funk Railroad circa 1971 and gave the lean mean FUNK a run for their money, a powerful double billed concert with both Bloodrock & Grand Funk in their prime.Lucky in the Morning 5:43Cheater 6:43Sable and Pearl 4:12Fallin' 4:00Children's Heritage 3:30Dier Not a Lover 4:05D.O.A. 8:25Fancy Space Odyssey 5:06"
3,Regarding the song D.O.A.,"Just for the record, several writers have spoken about D.O.A. with reference to an automobile crash. The song was not about a car crash. It is pretty well accepted that the song was referencing the ill fated Wichita State Football teams plane crash, which occurred on October 2, 1970 as they were on route to a game in Utah.Consider the line in the lyrics, ""I remember we were flying low and hit something in the air"" Followed by the line,Then i looked straight at the attendanthis face is pale as it can behe bends and whispers something softlyhe says there's no chance for me.Overall, an interesting relic of the early 70's. I still have the album and would buy the CD to replace it."
4,Good Stuff all the Way,"As the other reviews say, the album is best remembered (at least by some)for the song D.O.A. It was a classic. But D.O.A. isn't the best song on this album. For me, Cheater and Fallin' are both better cuts. There was once a review of this album in the Rolling Stone Record Guide that chided Bloodrock for being a ""stable mate"" of Grand Funk. Regardless of how you feel about Grand Funk, the comparison was unfair. Bloodrock was not Grand Funk. They shared a producer, Terry Knight, and a label, Capitol. All the cuts on this album deserve a listen. Trust me."
5,Bloodrock was Hot...Grandfunk Not,"I thought this album was Great!!! I never thought Grand Funk was that great. DOA was a good song but the others were even better. It is a shame they did not get the recognition they very much deserved. Check out some of their stuff on the first album also ""Timepiece and Melvin laid an egg"" are both very good."
4,VERY DIFFERENT,"THIS IS NOT A GREAT CD BY ANY MEASURE,BUT WHAT IT DOES HAVE IS THE SONG D.O.A.THIS SONG ALONE MAKES THIS A 4 STAR CD.I DON`T BELIEVE THERE HAS EVER BEEN A CRAZIER SONG PUT OUT.YOU TALK ABOUT A CREEPY STORY LINE,SOMEONE DIEING IN A CAR CRASH.BUT IT WORKS.THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS IS PURE GENIUS.THE WAY THEY PUT IN THE SIRENS AND THE CREEPY ORGAN MUSIC.THIS SONG ALONE MAKES THIS A MUST HAVE JUST FOR THE FACT THAT IT`S SO CREATIVE."
3,VERY DIFFERENT AS ALBUMS GO,"This is one of those strange albums whereas the ""B"" side is the best side.This album really doesn't seem to gel until ""Children's Heritage"" The main reason to buy this album is for ""DOA"", which is morbidity at its best. 9th grade I brought this 45 to school and for the next 3+yrs. I was known as one of my class' sicko's, which was perfect by me. Side ""A"" though to me seems like Bloodrock is trying to find a groove which they finally find with the last 4 songs.Maybe it's gotta grow on you , who knows?"
4,honky,"LEE PICKENS is a very good guitar player.HIS solos ARE great WITHOUT peers IN THEIR GENUINE homespun LETS JUST HAVE fun TO THE POINT,NO bologna BS LIKE countless OTHERS,clapton THERS no SHOW AWFULLNESS,stevie ray ether either HE PLAYS IT PLAIN AND SIMPLE BUT FAST, like the rest of the boys IN BLOODROCK, and SO, it just goes,KINDA HONKY TONKY ,no honky dory,BOWIE AFT FART artificial,SMARTS FOR THESE i envision bar stools flung at the walls angst,TO THE POINT,ROCK N ROLL seventy HARD ROCK FRILLS APENTY.and its done up in HEADY SPACEY STONER ,fluency MORE DIVERSE listening experiece IN WAYS MORE rewarding workmanship sound THAN IN ROCK ALMOST AS GOOD ARGUABLY BETTER than DEEP PURPLE."
2,"You Know Which Cut's The One Worth Having, Too...","...and I can spell it for you: ""D.O.A."" Rock and death have never exactly been strangers, but neither have they walked together with quite the brittle frankness and shameless fatalism as this composition, from a Texas outfit whose entire output otherwise was a textbook case of a very capable band with a very lame repertoire. (If they were still making 12-inch vinyl singles, you could put an excellent one together pairing Bloodrock's ""D.O.A."" and their other excellent number, ""Fantastic Piece of Architecture,"" from their first album.) Bloodrock probably deserved better. They weren't the first band with fine players and horrid songwriting, and they probably will not be the last. Add a star just for their being troupers."
3,High Camp,"Very camp/vamp collection of latin songs...a must have for Latin theme party affairs these days. Includes cuts from Xavier Cugat, Bing Crosby, Artie Shaw, Mae West, etc...lots of fun...compiled by Rod McKuen in the early 70's."
3,Haunting Euro Horror,"I was dying to see this film after reading about it in ""Images in the Dark"" ( a must have book on gay and lesbian films) The film is a lot better than I expected. Yes it does suffer from a low budget and atrocious English dubbing; but director Jesus Franco creates some haunting images that will stay with you after the final fade out."
1,I aged ten years after enduring this ...,"The idea of a virgin facing off with zombies if both exciting and titalating, but nothing made sense in this movie. The zombie scenes had nothing to do with the story--even though the story was non-existent and never there to begin with. No one gets eaten in this one folks. This movie repeats scenes a lot, which tells you the type of creativity piled to make this project. A heap of pony loaf smells better than this DVD waste. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS! No zombie action, no point, no story, and no gore. Franco ...!"
1,Do not confuse this with Fulcis Zombie,"this movie is called Zombie 4: Virging among the living dead in most stores, do not be fooled into buying it. It is a slow, horrible movie that honestly goes nowhere. It reminds me a lot of ""Revenge of the Dead"", which is equally boring..when the term ""Zombie"" is used, or ""Living Dead"" , one would expect zombies to play a key role in the movie, not wait until the movie is over to make thier appearance."
1,What???,"I first came across this movie on vhs rougly 6 or 7 years ago. I was browsing the horror section of a local Suncoast when I first discovered it. The cover had several grotesque looking zombies on it and the description of the film sounded pretty good so I took it home and watched it thinking I was in for a real surprise! I sure was! Too bad the surprise was that not only was this film so bad but it didn't even have anything to do with zombies. I have watched this movie a dozen times and still have no clue what it's about. There's no story, no plot, no zombies and it ends so abruptly that if you're not sitting down when it ends you'll fall over. It's like having the carpet pulled out from under you. Funny thing is I thought this would be the one film that would never see the light of day on dvd. Shows how much I know about marketing. I gave this film one star but only because that's the lowest I could go. Otherwise this movie would be in the red."
4,Fun With Franco,"Anyone who likes Franco or who is curious about a Franco movie should enjoy this one---typically weird, er, insane characters in a sleazy setting. Not exactly horrifying, but gratifying with its black humor, e.g. Franco's and Vernon's characters, and its creepy story of a woman sucked into insanity."
2,A total disappoint,"""Whisper His Name"", was a total disappoint. It wasn't up to her other books. As I continued to read, Abbie behaved stupidly and annoyingly. She never did trust Hugh and I couldn't understand her actions. She just kept hurting him, and with no reason at all. In the end I didn't liked her at all."
4,Whisper His Name,"I very much enjoyed this book, I have been quite a fan of the author for a number of years. The synopsis of this book has been attended to, so my thoughts.I liked the character of Abigail Vayle, strong, fiesty and independent. She was determined to live under her own terms in a time that such independence was frowned upon. Hugh was the most interesting character. A scholar and ex spy for the British but in love with Abby. I won't give away any spoilers but he certainly had a major conflict of interest at one stage in the book.This is an historical, mystery romance, more sensual than spicy. There is an engaging plotline and well worth the read. The other aspect that I enjoyed is that the characters were a slightly more mature. For me a worthwhile read."
4,Will read more Thorton,I loved the romantic suspence and it was not until the end that I fiqured out who the villian was. This was the first time that I read one of her books and I will be looking for more.
5,A DEFINITE KEEPER,"I came upon Elizabeth Thornton not too long ago and what a find! Her books grab you at the prologue and don't let go until the end. It's not too many authors who know how to immediately capture your attention in the first few pages. Her heroines are always strong, or quickly learn how to be strong, and refuse to be victims. In this story an innocent woman is catapulted into a deadly game of espionage through a chance encounter with a desperate spy. The hero is a friend who wants to be more than a friend. Great reading. Wonderful romance. Fast paced and sure to hold your attention until the end. Don't forget to request the epilogue to this story from ET's web site."
4,"Eminently readable, informative",My students have enjoyed this book over the years as an optional book in ancient history courses; it is the starting place for anyone interested in childhood or education in the period.
4,She Can Do No Wrong,"The lastest from Mike Oldfield's session singer. She fronted his huge hits Moonlight Shadow, To France, Family Man and a number of other single and album tracks. Finally going solo in 92 with the release of Echoes, she really solidified her fame and vocal signature at that moment. She scored several big hits, including the pop smash, Every Time We Touch, that would be later disco-butchered by German group Cascada in 2007 and 2008. Rowan is a nice CD with three or four standouts and some nice, mellow Celtic/Folk tracks. Not very pop, but still, it's sweet-voiced Maggie. If you like Maggie's pop releases, then check out Sally Oldfield's Three RingsThree Ringsand Secret SongsSecret Songs"
2,Savatage's worst album,"This is almost glam crap! The saving points are 1) its Savatage, 2) Criss, Jon, and the boys still rock, 3) its kind of heavy and 4) another interesting morph of Savatage. Even the guys in the band agree that this wasn't so great. But for about $10 adding this to your collection isn't too risky, especially if you love this excellent band. DO NOT make this your first purchase of Savatage."
1,The worst Savatage album.,Let's be sincere to ourselves: this is the worst Savatage album. It looks like Poison and Dokken. There's not one great song. Period.
1,Savatage's weakest album,"For collectors only. This record is a conglomeration of uninteresting metal tunes weighed down by generic subject matter, boring instrumentation, and shallow lyrics. Uninspired covers of ""Day After Day"" and ""Wishing Well"" don't help. A major disappointment from a band that has done much better work."
2,Thanks ...!!,"Thanks God that Savatage proved to be gifted musicians after this album, then proceeding to achieve a great status inside the world of metal. Because, in this FIGHT FOR THE ROCK, we don't get a clue of what was to come. The album is immersed in thwe wrost glam cliches ever written, it's cold, formulatic, really disgusting. Nothing good comes out of it, except one or two good riffs."
2,Every great band has a less-than average album,"Fight For The Rock was Savatage's attempt to reach a more main-stream audience and their music suffered accordingly. Normally, an exceptionally excellent metal band, this album is the one that only dedicated Savatage fans will ""enjoy"".As other reviewers have noted, in spite of it's many weak moments a couple of the songs are quite good which makes the disc worthwhile if your aim is to collect every Savatage album (as I have).Do not buy this if you are new to Savatage, instead allow me to recommend ""The Wake Of Megellan"", ""Streets"", or ""Hall Of The Mountain King""."
3,Better than the lousy reviews this cd ussually gets,"While no way can you compare this this cd with Hall of the Mountain king, Gutter ballet and Edge of Thorns; it is still as good as the latter Savatage cd's involving Handful of rain, Dead winter deadThis cd is a good basic rock/metal album with great singing and guitar playing, but the songwriting is not up to snuff.Never the less it is comparable to the latest releases by Ac/dc and Kiss.It one could give 10 stars, I would give it 6/10"
3,"Not Their Best, But Still Worth A Listen.","As far as I know, a lot of people weren't too happy with this offering. To tell you the truth, it's not their greatest, but it surely isn't poor either. This is their most commerical album though, listen to ""Day After Day"" for instance. The former song is a cover they did from another band as far as I know, but I still like it commerical or not. ""Crying for Love"" is also good and is a different version from the earlier one on one of their first albums. Fight For the Rock is a bit too commercial, but not a total disappointment like their later albums without Jon Oliva."
2,Just TRY using this in LA,"Where I live, radio stations use every single available frequency. That means, there is no spot on the radio dial that is free for a device such as this. It might work if you live in a rural area without a lot of radio coverage.I want to use my iPOD in the car, but I don't have a cassette player in the car. When is someone going to come out with a CD-adapter?"
1,Poor Design,"This device has a very sensitive on/off switch on the top. Just accidentaly bumping the device will turn it on and drain the batteries. You can't safely carry it in a bag or briefcase because of this defect, unless you always remove the batteries. Terrible design. And sound is poor from interference. Low volume. I had to crank the stereo up to max volume to hear my source music."
2,Say what?!,"If this worked, it would be great. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Even with the unit placed on top of the radio (a high-end JVC -- some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the FM receiver), it was still filled with static, and sounded cheap (which admittedly, the iPod is). I don't know if it's worth the postage to return it to Amazon. From all I'm reading, it might work well if you're in an uncrowded FM area (but I wouldn't bet on it)."
2,"A waste of money, unless you live in the radio wasteland...","It's a nice concept, looks kinda cool, but doesn't work very well at all. It only offers four radio frequencies, which is okay if you live somewhere were there aren't many radio stations (in the FM 87 range). Also, the sound quality was not well. To hear the music at a decent volume (and don't blast my music at all), I had to turn my car radio up quite a bit. These ""features"" created a really annoying effect. I'd have the irock set to a frequency where there wasn't a station broadcasting on the radio, then have to turn up the volume a fair amount (so I could hear it), then a radio station signal would get strong enough to show up and blast out and scare me half to death, while driving... Not a fun experience.Save your money on this one and buy a transmitter that lets you pick from more than 4 stations, and has better sound quality..."
2,I concur -- barely adequate,"First the good points: the packaging and mechanical designare really cute. Plus there is a switch so you can chooseone of four frequencies in the ~87-89 Mhz band. And it'sself contained because it runs on 2 AAA batteries.[Caveat: the batteries are installed *in*the*same*direction*,unlike most other appliances where they go head to tail.]Now the downside: disappointing audio quality. It had weaksignal strength and distortion galore. Sound quality wasnot even FM quality!!I used mine for two days, and now it gathers dust. I wentback to a cassette adapter."
2,Nice while it lasted,"Great concept and the device worked great ""FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS"" and died. The 90 day warranty is, of course, useless. I will by another brand this time."
2,"Mediocre quality, poor signal strength","Th way it works is, it comes with 4 FM station hard wired. You select which one you want to try and broadcast to by flipping a small dip switch. They are all at the low end of the FM dial....88.1, 88.3 88.5 and 88.7. Problem is, I live in L.A. and there are stations on 2 of the four presets and the others bleed so I can't really even use this in Metro L.A. It could be different where you live. When you get out in the boonies on a road trip and there's no competition for stations, it's adequate but don't expect CD quality sound. It's more like average FM reception."
2,quality is not that good - and get intereference easily,"I bought this two days ago at radio shack. The quality is pretty good, but is susceptible to inteference very easily. I found that if I hold my hand over it its a bit better, but still not perfect. Battery operated and all."
3,Good idea...,"I bought this so I could play CDs in my car, which had a busted tape player. I was planning a cross country trip, and thought it might come in handy.The implementation of the product is so-so at best. I don't always get stereo from the iRock, depending on the position of the wire connecting it to the headphone jack of my CD player. During the day, the reception is a little bit less clear. Also, I have to turn up the volume pretty high on my in-dash receiver when the signal isn't coming in in stereo.Overall, I like the product, but if I found another product that performed the same functions I would probably drop the iRock pretty quick, due to the aformentioned problems"
1,Don't Buy!!!,"Dont buy the iRock. First of all, it eats batteries like a madman! Second, when you move it, it distorts the sound on the radio. Third, it only has 4 stations, and if there is a station broadcasting on any of thoes, it runs over and distorts the sound on the other 3. Fourth, after taking care of it, and using it for about 3 weeks, the wires in the conector from the mini-jack to the transmitter broke, and now they short circuit, draning batteries and distorting the sound even more!My sugestion, if it is for an iPod, buy a Griffin Technology iTrip. They are great!! If not for an iPod, get a cassette adapter."
2,Meh.,"If all conditions are optimal, this unit seems to work OK. By ""all conditions"" I really mean that:1) no stations in the area near the limited frequency range (88.1-88.7)2) the batteries are fresh, new and full3) your FM radio has a good (but not too good) antennaIf using in a car, use a casette adapter instead. If using in a house, I recommend finding a unit that is optionally AC powered, as this will give you only a couple of hours life..."
3,"OK, but only out in the country","This device works wonderfully well as long as you're away from cities of any size. On California US 101, it's great between Salinas and Atascadero, but useless everywhere else. It uses four frequencies in the 88 part of the FM band, which is where most college radio stations and NPR affilates seem to end up.If you live in or near a college town, you probably won't have much luck with the Irock .However, it would be a great thing to have on a cross-country road trip.Griffin Technologies has announced the iTrip, an iPod-specific device. I've not seen the final specs yet, but prototypes offered a wider range of frequencies."
2,works okay for a few weeks....,"Hellos to all. My iRock worked fine for a few weeks. You might want to check for a clear channel to select from, it uses 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7. Southern Atlanta is problematic due to a 100,000 watt radio station at 88.5 but this is unusual. Apparently there is a bad design in the product that makes the wires leading out unstable and fragile After about 3 months the right channel stopped working, and soon I found myself constantly fiddling with the unit to try to get it to re-establish contact. It gets old pretty quick let me tell you. So if you wanna buy something that will last only a few weeks, you're making a great choice."
1,"Nice try, but...","Like many reviews here, this is a good idea, and it does what it says it will. Just not with much audio quality. It sounds worse than a marginal FM station. OK for audio books, but not music."
2,underpowered,"The unit is underpowered. Works well if the antenna on your radio is right next to the irock. Otherwise, its like picking up a weak radio station. I'm not sure if I'll have any uses for a device who's range seems to be less than a 6 foot cable."
2,disappointing,"specs claim item has an extensible antenna, my unit doesn't. That might help with the most serious shortcoming, which is, I have to put the transmitter practically on top of my radio to make it work.Apparently, there's a competing product which permits tuning to a wider range of frequencies. This only allows tuning to four frequencies 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 88.7, but the local (crummy) classical station at 88.3 stomps all over those frequencies."
2,Poor Transmission Power -- Very sensitive to radio stations,Do not get the iRock unless you live far from civilization... and even then think again.We bought it for a trip from SF to LA along I-5. Even though most of the trip is going through the middle of nowhere there were still EXTREMELY weak stations on the desired frequencies. The iRock was UNABLE to get any sort of consistent signal to the reciever the entire trip.I would strongly recommend thinking twice before purchasing this item.
2,iRock falls a little short,"The iRock offers an easy to use sleek design, as well as very good battery life. It's one of the smallest versatile FM transmitters I've seen.Conversely its transmitting strength subtly decreases a while before the battery light goes out. It also has a very small range of FM stations making it difficult to get a clear channel. Its signal range was also very short requiring very close placement to any radio device. I was a little skeptical of the molded wire when I first saw it that was until the mini-jack end started to slide out and finally rendered the device useless."
2,Useless in Major Cities,I bought this product to use in the car. It only has 4 bands and in the Bay Area does not work well...there are too many radio stations that interfere. I used it in Europe over Christmas and it worked perfectly as there were no stations interfering with one of its channels
2,Works ok under some circumstances,I find the the unit works well at home with a sophisticated receiver... but in the car it is very much affected by the environment. It works ok in some areas and terrible in other areas. I don't think this is a good solution. I'm buying a Honda Element which has an Aux input jack. All cars should have that.
1,"Poor quality, Don't waste time or money",This product is a waste of time and money. The sound quality is worse than am radio. If your looking for sound quality don't buy this product. Lot of static and interference no matter what frequency you set it to. It does not live up to its advertised claims.
1,waste of money,"I only wish I'd looked over some of these reviews before going out and buying this little gizmo. It seemed to work fine for me, but, like others, I had problems with batteries draining quickly while in use (NiMHs), the power button being accidentally pushed too easily while not in use, the cord being too short for practicality, and in the end, my the whole thing died when the wires running from the adapter to the unit broke from the constant bending and unbending (which you'd think the manufacturers would have taken into account in their design). Defintely two thumbs down.."
2,Sounds Good But Major Design Flaw,"I don't have audiophile expectations of a device that broadcasts radio frequency of mp3s. In spite of the limitations of the technologies, it sounds satisfactory. But, the folks at irock! really blew it with the on/off button. Positioned on the top of the unit is a 'soft-touch' button and red led indicator light/window. The indicator is impossible to see in daylight. And worse, I have not stored the unit in my car's console even once without it jostling around in there and activating the on button. Consequently, everytime I use it I must replace the two AAA batteries. They last a long time in normal play, but the position and sensitivity of the button is unacceptable. My Creative Labs Nomad III has a great feature for saving batteries - you must hold the on button down for a full 5 seconds to turn it on or off. irock! should take note . . ."
2,"Great idea, needs work on the design.","I purchased this item to listen to Audible.com programs on my digital player in the truck I drive. The Irock works great when its brand new, it just lays on the seat next to you and plays away. The problem I've found is the more you handle the device (changing batteries, moving from place to place) the more chance you have of the wires breaking at the point where the cord goes into the main body of the device. Everytime the cord is flexed the wires get weaker until they break right where they are soldered onto the circuit board. Also if you use rechargeable alkaline batteries as I do, plan on changing batteries every 4 hours or so constant use. Also if you're not careful when you put it in your pocket or other purse or bag, whatever - the button is easy to press and it runs your battery down. If these problems could be fixed this would be a great product."
2,Could work better!,"The iRock is only moderately useful. The iRock has to be held close to the radio to work well without static. It does work, but not as well as it could. It is a little expensive for what it is and does, it seems to me. Ergonomically, it looks great, though!"
2,"Useful, but needs work...","For the money, this is a nice, inexpensive way to hook your computer to your stereo, or play your MP3 or other portable music player through the car stereo when you're on the road.On the other hand, if you're a stickler for sound quality (like me), you'll most-likely be disappointed. The signal is not consistent, fading in and out with various hisses and pops. In addition, the device picks up interference from just about everything, including the device it's plugged into, so you really have to fiddle and adjust positions and frequencies to minimize the static. It's not so bad if you're using it around the house, but extremely annoying if you're on the road where the sound quality and interfering signals may change every couple of miles."
2,Irock - it works but weakly,I wanted to play my iPod tunes in my car. I had a cassette adapter but the quality was not satisfactory. I bought the Irock 300w thinking it would be better as there would not be the mechanical problem of cassette head alignment with the cassette adapter.It works. The sound comes through the radio on the tuned channel. The quality is not very good. The signal drops occasionally. I found improvement by moving the unit around the vehicle but since my car antenna is in the rear that is where it worked best. It is a little difficult to control the iPod when it is several feet behind you. It is also not convenient to run a cable back there to have the Irock closer to the antenna.I don't use it. I use the cassette adapter with its own poor sound quality problems.
2,Works but don't expect great quality,"I bought the Irock at Radio Shack because I noticed the cassette adaptor for playing MP3s on my car stereo was not playing well through both channels. I took it home, put batteries in it, plugged it into my laptop, and tuned my FM to the needed channel. The sound was fair at best. I had to turn up my volume a lot to get the same sound level as my cassette adaptor. I could hear a high picthed hum, which sounded like some noise from the power source that was not filtering out.If you don't have any other method of listening to your portable device over the stereo, then this may be ok to use. But I took mine back for a refund."
1,Not good...at all,"I bought one iRock adapter on RadioShack and it was 30 bucks throwed down the garbarge...at first ir did work, but in my city there are a lot of radio stations so it was kind of difficult to make it stay in one frequency and work at all. Then it just died, I changed batteries, etc but it just not work, I turn it on and it turns off in seconds and I can get it to work...I hate it."
1,I returned it.,"I wanted to be able to sit on the ground and have my iBook's mp3s play into my stereo, wirelessly (since I fell in love with AirPort wireless internet).However, in my area, it just doesn't work. Other radio stations interfered, and even when it didn't seem they should, the signal still seemed too weak, even three inches from the receiver. Disappointing... I'll need to see a new revision before I try this again."
1,Disappointing,"I suppose if you don't live in a metropolitan area with stations around the frequencies the iRock has presets for, you might get better performance out of it than I have. I have had my unit about one week, and I must say I am disappointed. The idea is great, but the functionality at the power it puts out stinks.I have tried all kinds of positioning, even placing the unit in my ashtray which is directly below my radio. I tried aligning the unit's cord so it is oriented correctly with the car antenna.On top of mediocre performance, it has gobbled through batteries, and despite a lot of empty space inside the unit, there isn't an option for a DC power adapter.Hey iRock, if you are reading this, don't take it personally, but you should have done more field testing before releasing this product."
2,"Fair performance, NOT great for iPod use","Initially, I purchased the iRock to connect a CD player to my car stereo. Sound quality is very good, so long as you aren't in an area where broadcast stations use all the limited frequencies of 88.1 to 88.7 offered on the iRock. (Other products offer a wider choice.) Where I live, college radio uses 88.1 and 88.3, and NPR is on 88.5, with a strong signal classical station on 88.9, so NONE of the iRock's channels provides real clear sound. The connector cord, which fits into the headphone jack of the player, is also too long. It worked okay when I had a CD player, but now I have an iPod, and the cord is just annoyingly too long, causing the iRock's main pod to slide off the car seat and dangle to toward the floor, where gravity eventually causes it to detach from my iPod. What a pain!"
1,Unusable,"I purchased this product hoping to be able to listen to my iPod through my car radio, and I found it completely unacceptable for this purpose. I was not able to receive a clear signal on any of the four supported frequencies. There was usually a lot of background hiss. This could be reduced by moving the unit around in the car, from dashboard to front seat, back to dashboard, etc. Even when I managed to eliminate the hiss, the audio was still muddy and distorted. Thinking the problem might have been due to my car stereo, I tried it in a friend's car with the same results. This was in the Washington, DC metro area, where the FM band is crowded. Results might be better in rural areas, or perhaps in a car with a windshield antenna rather than an outside one. I eventually gave up on the iRock and replaced my car stereo with one that has an auxiliary input."
2,newer isn't always better,"If you need it for your car, forget about it!! I was looking for the cassette-style converter for my new i-pod but a zealous salesman talked me into buying the irock-----no wires when you're driving yada-yada-yada--and it sounded great on the stereo in the store. It cost ten dollars more, but I felt so cutting edge!! The sound is awful! the reception is awful! the only time I may use it is on my stereo receiver at home. NO great advantage because popping in the CD is just as easy. really disappointed."
1,"Neat Idea, but doesn't work!","I bought one of these for my ipod, having used one of those cassette shaped adapters before. I was getting tired of having the wires trailing everywhere, but it turns out that the old technology works much better.The 4 frequencies they give you to choose from are all pretty close together, and our local NPR station broadcasts on a frequency that its right in the middle of them (88.5). I don't know quite what is happening, but the tuning lock on the irock seems to get cancelled out by the broadcast station, and the irock turns itself off every couple of seconds, leaving loud badly tuned static instead of my ipod. I have tried it in different parts of the city, and on all four of the frequencies they provide but they are all as bad as each other. Don't know what to do with it! I suggest you check you local broadcast radio station frequencies before you buy this product and make sure there is nothing even close!"
1,iRock will make you irate,This is garbage. Reception is terrible. Home stereo/car stereo boom box whatever. It does not work.
1,Junk,I hooked this up to my MP3 player and placed it right next to the receiver and got a terrible reception. No matter where I placed it or what frequency I used the reception was poor at home or in the car. Forget about it.....
1,Don't waste your time with this worthless product,"I don't have a tape player in my car so I bought the IROCK so that I could listen to my MP3 player. This is an absolutely horrible product and I can't stress how worthless this was for me. At first I put the blame on the fact that the only frequency settings you can use on the device were too close to stations in my city. OK, I can't use it in the city but I usually only want to use the MP3 player when I go on hiking trips or longer drives outside of the city anyway. It didn't matter. Even when I was unable to get any FM stations on my radio, the IROCK still fluctuated between sounding OK to having a lot of static over my music. Most of the time it was static. I wish I could recommend another product but I haven't tried another adapter yet. What I can tell you is to avoid this product unless you want to throw your money away on something that doesn't even work."
2,fuzzy sounds....,"this product is not good for major urban areas, where the 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, or 88.7 FM frequencies may be crowded.it also loses some audio quality and sometimes sounds fuzzy."
1,Don't bother,"Get a tape adaptor, this FM Transmitter is lousy and incosistent as you drive around and other signals interfere with it."
1,Get an iTRIP instead --,Threw this away and got an iTrip instead - it's the size and shape of a very large vitamin and takes NO batteries. Brilliant!!
1,SAVE YOUR CASH!,"what a bummer, bought this at rat shack and tested it out on the way to work the next day. (very excited to use w/o a silly wire commin' out of my deck)i had to hold the cable tightly in my hand to help boost the already existing weak signal power output.going to rat shack on my way home."
3,Consider getting an speaker/headphone extension cable,"I found that I could get static-free, consistently clear sound only if I placed the unit in the back seat of my car which basically made it useless. I invested another [money] or so and bought a generic speaker/headphone extension cable that allows me to keep my iPod in the front seat and the adapter in the back seat. It works perfectly.I also tested (and decided to keep) a Tunecast, made by Belkin, which is essentially the same thing at the same price. It has a slightly slimmer body and a recessed on/off button (unlike the Irock's button which is too easily accidentally pushed).The Irock and Belkin units work (or should I say don't work) equally well but I would definitely not be keeping either without the extension cable."
1,Didn't work for me - good idea if it worked,"Apparently this works for some folks, not for others. Count me the latter group. I tried this in two cars. In one, it scarcely worked at all. In the other car, it worked pretty well, but there was loud static/interference about every 90 seconds. That's just too much noise to make it useful. I live in a metro area with a strong station at 88.1 and another at 88.5, and perhaps that is too much signal to allow the IRock to work comfortably. In short, I felt I gave this a fair chance and it just didn't meet my needs. I returned it and got a cassette adapter instead."
1,Doesn't work in the city,This device is just sitting in my drawer gathering dust.I live in Boston and haven't been able to get reasonable reception on any of the frequencies available on this adapter. It cuts in and out between the MP3s and the radio stations that broadcast on or near those frequencies.
2,Not a good design,"The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there."
2,FM Modulators Never works fine,"I am not telling that this product doesn't works, but I bought 2 different FM Modulators and neither of both works acceptable. As my Factory Radio doesn't accepts AUX inputs, I rather bought another Stereo with an AUX input and it is the best well spent money in sound quality for my Ipod in my car. Specially if you like to listen music, better think in make a greater inversion and no to throw out your money with FM modulators!"
3,"Works well, just be aware of limitations","Unlike others I have tried, this transmitter actually worked and produced a reasonable signal on my car radio. I can now listen to stuff stored on my iPod. Quality is not great, and with only four station settings (on a switch on the side--88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7MHz) you are quite likely to run into interferance from real FM stations. And as others have said the quality of the signal is pretty marginal--more AM than FM. But it does work, and it doesn't cost a lot, and its easy to use. That's a power-on/off toggle button on the front by the way."
3,Iraq,I bought this tiny little gadget because it sounded like the country we just invaded (err liberated). I thought it is cool to work with my Archos.The reception is great if you live in areas where you have no competition for 88 FM like in the desert of IRAQ.Desert Fox
1,Bad Desigh + Cheap Manufacturing = BAD PRODUCT,"Forget the range of the IRock's transmission (which is pathetic - I had to run an extension and place it at the rear of my car near the antennae to get decent reception.) My main complaint is with the bafflingly bad design - unless you have the space in your car to lay it out flat (and 2 sided tape to keep it from sliding around) it's going to end up dangling from your music player, and will put stress on the product's weakest point - the connection point. Sure enough, about a week after my 90 day warranty expired the connection was stressed and the right channel began cutting in and out.Avoid this tempting little device like the plague - you're much better off spending a few more bucks and getting a solid FM transmitter, and one that you can tune to any station - another downside of the IRock is its limit of 4 distinct tuning settings, each of which in Los Angeles has strong competition from local public radio."
1,Range is very limited - save your money,"I bought this device with the hope that I could use my Nomad Zen Jukebox MP3 player in my car and hear the music from my car radio receiver. I couldn't get it to work in my car.Out of curiosity, I tried other FM radios in my home. I got it to work with my living room stereo system's FM receiver, but only when the device was less than 2 feet from the antennae. Interestingly, I could not get it to work on a Kenwood mini-stereo system or my Panasonic CD/radio boombox even with the devices inches from the antennaes."
2,Convenient and useable but far from perfect,"Convenient and a great idea but problem areas:Low volume. Poorer than my cassette adapter.Have had radio station interference on all 4 frequencies and have had to revert to cassette adapter.Power button switches on easily - wasted loads of batteries - now I remove batteries every time it is not in use.With battery in, the battery cover is very tight - feels like the pressure could pop it off. Hasn't happened but it must put strain on the plastic ""latch"""
3,"A good compilation, but not the original album!","This CD is a compilation of some of Denver's music, but is not actually the original version of Rocky Mountain High. For those of you who are not particular on his work, it is a great CD. But, if you are a collector, and really looking to have this album, check out a different CD."
4,Great Make Out Album,"This is not a ""Best of..."" album (as erroneously stated in other reviews), and if you've only heard John Denver on the radio, then there is only one song on here you'll know: Rocky Mountain High, and maybe Grandma's Feather Bed. However, this is fantastic music. The great thing about John Denver's music is whether it was a hit or not, it is gorgeous music from Colorado's late Poet Laureate. And I stand by the title of my review: It is great ""make out music."""
5,Riddle Within an Enigma,"Not often you read a mystery that is truly surprising and yet plays fair with the reader. Find Courtney is not about what it says it's about or even what its characters think its about, but a true puzzle about identity formation unravelled in the first person. Who are we and what makes us that way, where are we going and what do we want? These ideas are mixed very satisfyingly into a missing person story that turns into a love story that turns into a murder story."
3,Enjoyable.,"These are sturdy, straight-forward and well-executed accounts that, while not challenging the sumptious renditions of Ormandy and his fabulous Philadelphians, give much pleasure. If your looking for the hyper-romantic approach go elsewhere, Wohlert and the Berlin Radio Symphony deliver good old-fashioned central European music making. For its price this CD offers excellent value."
4,Great cutter,"Well, this corn cutter works great. For me, to just remove the kernels, the most difficult step was getting the kernel depth and scraper depth correct after removing the shredder. Mine came set at the deepest depth, and that ended up cutting some of the cob into the mix (with a lot of pressure). So I set both blades at the half-way depth, and it worked great. Cutting the corn off a cob is actually pretty fast once you get the hang of it!"
5,Corn cutter,"I love this item. When I used to help my mother with her canning/freezing I used this item and it was so easy. When I needed one to do my own at home I had a hard time finding any in the stores. I could only find them through Amazon, (until after I made my purchase) but these are so much cheaper and better made. I prefer the wooden ones. I bought two while I was ordering, one for me and one for a helper.I would recommend these to anyone who wants to get the job done quickly and easily. Its adjustable to however you want to have your corn, from creamed to whole kernel. Just have to be careful when doing the cutting so you dont cut yourself on the sharp blade. I would not recommend letting a young child use it. You can also buy replacement blades if ever needed, but they are very sharp and will probably last quite awhile. My mothers did, and she used it ALOT. Good Luck"
4,old fashioned fun,"This corn cutter is just like the one my grandmother used to use when I was a child (30 years ago). It cuts the corn cleanly from the cob, and the blade can be adjusted up or down for a creamier corn, or a whole kernel product. The only down-side is that the corn silks get caught on the edges and you have to keep cleaning them off so they don't get in the cut corn. Clean-up is easy if you use a scrubber/brush. A nice and fun product!"
5,excellent frozen corn,"this is the best all-round corn on the cob cutter for freezing and canning ,best use of your time with this item"
1,Lee's Wooden Corn Cutter,I bought two of these and they both went out in the trash with the corn cobs. Grabbed a knife and did much better without them.
1,Good only for cream style corn,"This works only to cut cream style corn off the cob. If you want whole kernels, this is not the tool for you."
5,practical and easy,"Often we want to prepare food in the corn, but it is very laborious and messy. With the corn cutter everything changed for me. Now is a snap and the preparation is done. So I give 5 stars."
3,Didn't meet up to Expectations,"I was dissapointed by this book. The other books in the Bordertown series were so incredible, that I, being the sort I am, expected this one to meet the same criteria. The best part of the Bordertown series is the interpersonal dynamics of the people. This book seemed to rely on the individual to much, there weren't as many friendships and relationships. Which is, to me, what made the other books work so well. I know this is most likely the last of the Bordertown series that we are likely to see. A sad ending to an incredible series."
4,"Not bad, not great","A little precious and twee, but still worth reading. I had just read Emma Bull's Finder (set in the same universe), which is a good novel and has a lot of emotional depth. These short stories were just to short and obvious in comparison. I was also annoyed by the tour guide format, especially the ""rah-rah"" aspects which came out quite smug. Oh well."
3,real big tunes,this cd is the bomb. A must buy for all enthusiasts of back in times dance hall music. No track on the cd is worth skipping and the cd provides hours of pure dancehall entertainment.
4,"Not bad, but not the best.......","There are others that I have gotten more from, but I've already read them. This did add to my knowledge, especially as I am planning a Keys trip myself. This was the most useful part for me. Good winter reading!"
3,Littlest Pet Shop (puppy),My little boy loves to play with his littlest pet shop puppy. My only issue is that all of the littlest pet shop digital pets look too girly
3,digital pets,It was very hard to figure out how to get to all the games involved and no instructions for how they're played.
4,Live Giant,"If you don't have any of their other records, this is a good place to start. It's a great overview of Gentle Giant's best years, as good as any compilation gets, and man could they play well live. One of the 70's best concert recordings."
5,Nothing But Superlatives,"I read every review before writing this one tonight. So many of them are right on. These guys were incredible. Unbelieveably intricate and involved compositions, performed by virtuoso musicians. Their live shows were spellbinding, funny and lots of fun. I was fortunate to watch one soundcheck in 1976 (my friends opened for them) and to watch them rehearse was awe-inspiring. Even just hashing things out, they were beyond belief. How did God happen to put these five magicians together in one ensemble? The results are heavenly, and this album does a great job of capturing the energy, talent and musicianship that was Gentle Giant live. Go buy it."
5,Awsome!,"This one is a killer. The recording on live is just amazing. I think Gentle Giant icome""s from another Planet!!!"
3,"nice rug heater, could be warmer","I bought this to warm the rug and surrounding area of the room. Well, the rug was warmed but I was expecting it to be warmer. Had no real effect on the overall comfort of the room IMO. Nice to lay on in front of tv or just stretch out."
3,Water cleaning chemical - not first choice,"I have not had the need to use these yet. Hopefully never will. However, you must be nominally prepared for an emergency of our immediate water supply/source. I would prefer a distillator but have to research more, they are much more costly & I must make allowances for such a device.Tht said; I found these to be a good addition to an emergency kit in the event of a short term water emergency."
3,Cheaper at Walmart,"This exact same potable aqua, along with the tablets can be found at walmart for 5 dollars. Its the same thing, just cheaper, and at walmart. Oh and it works too btw."
2,"Great, but not needed.","I have tried this with and without the neutralizing tablets, and I can say that I don't mind the taste. Plus, if you're really thirsty, and have already been waiting 1/2 an hour to purify your water, chance are you won't want to wait another 3 or so minutes to make it taste a tiny bit better. Buy the one with just the purification tablets, you'll save your self a few bucks."
4,They're back,"This song also appears on the soundtrack to ""One Night at McCool's"". Originally recorded by side-project Savoy."
2,A Rip Off of Big Daddy Roth's Fame! Don't waste your money!,"As a child, I was there buying Big daddy's model build sets in 1964! Along with other model sets like Dracula and Frankenstein. Ed Roth was not known for any type of music but he did release three bad albums that had great artwork in the covers. And that's why I bought them. But the music contained within was silly, stupid and a waste of time. Certainly not enjoyable by any means. And then the release of the songs on this CD set came and I could not beleive that people bought it. It was so putrid and the artwork was miniature in comparison. It's best that you buy the original album covers no matter what shape the records are in. It's cheaper and more fun to have. And it's still freaks out the young people when they see it. It's great to see their reaction!Three sellers who want to sell their ""three CD set"" have given me negatives, but it is what it is!"
1,What the Hell!,"Was the German version, and would NOT play in either of my video players.DO NOT BUY! Check out other options. Good thing Amazon is out of stock. Theywere probably all sent back to Germany."
1,Horrible!,DVD would not play. Gave disc error. I needed this DVD for a school project! But it would not play. Such a waste of time and effort.
1,What gives?,"I bought this to show to my English classes and could not because it is in PAL format rather than NTSC. I contacted the seller to return the item, but got no response. At this point I am stuck with a movie I cannot show without either buying a different player or downloading software to play it via my computer.I'm sure the movie is fine-- it did come new, but it will remain that way since I don't have too many options at this point."
2,"Too tiny, too thin","This is quite small and is composed mainly of images (painting: details of painting: further details of painting etc.). For me the text was actually the interesting part of the publication; quotes and contemporary commentary and criticism of beauty and fashion pair with each reproduced image to emphasize and explain the fashions shown in the painting to a modern viewer. As interesting as the quotes are, they are the only text in the book and I believe any general art history book would give the reader a far deeper appreciation for the context of the painting. Rather than purchasing this book, look for publications of the pencil drawings and portraits of artistis like Ingres for beautifully rendered contemporary costume."
4,hoorah for public raido,"i thought i was the only one whos even heard of the show, but i guess not.... its rad how theyve got locals and stuff... the only thing wrong is a few tracks lag on.... but pacifica blues and taken by surprise....rock"
1,Have movie fans lost their collective funny bone?,"I'm completely shocked at the high rating this movie seems to be getting. Not only did I not hink this was funny, I think it's one of the most UNfunny movies I've ever seen. I expected much more from this cast of actors, but almost all the jokes fall flat. There's a few amusing scenes, but getting to the end of this movie was pure torture. Since a lot of other people seem to like it, I'm not going to tell you to forget it (maybe it will turn out to be your cup of tea), but please rent it before buying it. If I'd purchased this dog based on these reviews, I'd be very disappointed. Not only wasn't it fun watching this the first time, but the prospect of repeated viewings makes me both sleepy and ill."
1,Another very unfunny film from 2001,"I am generally not a fan of the ""road film comedies"" like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world"" and ""cannonball run"". So, you fans of those films will probably appreciate this one.It's supposed to be a comedy, but I wasn't laughing. I must have lost my sense of humor somewhere in 2001 with the rest of the bad comedies that came out.This film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I don't recommend it."
1,Not even worth renting,"I rented the dvd of this movie, It's supposed to be a comedy, unfortunately, I couldn't even laugh one time at anyone of the jokes.After just 10 minutes I decided to 4x/8x speed through the movie to get it over with.This was the worst spending of my time in a very long time."
4,better than i expected,"When I first saw previews for Rat Race , I didn't think much of it. It appeared to be another stupid comedy. I was ill recently and had the opportunity to watch Rat Race and I have to say that my initial impressions were quite wrong. Rat Race is a fun little movie. Reminding me of both It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Cannonball Run , Rat Race is a road movie with a cross- country race for a prize. Featuring a large and recognizable cast of older and newer actors (from Kathy Bates and Whoopie Goldberg to Breckin Meyer and Seth Green), nobody gets a star billing, but everyone gets some time to shine."
2,If horrible endings aggrivate you dont watch this movie,"I wont lie to you.. I liked the movie at first, some parts were mildly funny and it was okay UNTIL .. the ENDING ahh yes people say the ending could have been better could is not the word- the ENDING made me want to wretch it was so lame i cant even begin to AARRGHH .. i dont need anger management I need someone to tell me who came up with the bright idea of doing that with the money and then SMASH MOUTH? and that god awful ridiculous song ""Allstar"" thats been in every other goddforsaken movie .. Well i Wish I could just tell you all the ending because it was horrible and See its a mad mad mad world its funny and the ending isnt lame and theres no cheese sellout band playing [bad] music...watch this movie if youre like me at the moment Sick and Bored! Oh and by the way if youre the wholesome type who likes to see a comedy turn into touched by an angel family heartwarming junk you might like it"
3,Nothing new or special here...,"Rat Race is a film whose parts are stronger than the whole. Some of the characters are extremely funny like Rowan Atkinson and John Cleese. Others aren't so funny (Cuba Gooding, Seth Green, Brecken Meyer). In fact, the funniest parts of Rat Race are also the shortest. Picture Mr. Bean and Newman from Seinfeld wading through a field looking for an organ donors heart or John Cleese with ridiculously large buck-teeth playing a billionaire who loves to bet on anything, and I MEAN ANYTHING! Jerry Zucker's direction is adequate but having produced such immortal films as Airplane! and The Naked Gun, I expected a little more from this comedy legend. Rat Race is not a new concept (see Cannonball Run) but Zucker and this talented cast had the opportunity to re-invent the money chase film for the new millenium, unfortunately they dropped the ball. Recommended for cable viewing only."
3,Ok,"This movie was kind of funny at times, but some of it was pretty dumb(or disgusting). The movie had a good plot, much to my suprise. There are 8 people trying to reach 2,000,000 dollars. It was a pretty good movie most of the time."
5,What a run!,"This is one fun ride! The movie follows a group of people as they scurry around the country trying to get to a mailbox containing 2 million dollars. The characters are fantastic, especially Rowan Atkinson (always enjoyable) as a gleefully funny character much like ""Mr. Bean."" All of the actors do a wonderful job, and you'll roll into your floor laughing at some of the prediciments the folks get themselves into (especially Jon Lovitz on stage at the WWII meet... you'll understand when you see it!). A must see and must own. Just delightful."
5,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF THE SUMMER,"Mr. Bean, W. Goldberg, and other great actors make this movie extraordinarily funny and awesome. I could not stop laughing!Can't wait till it comes out on video! I will be the first one to buy! If you need a mood enhancer, this is the way to go!"
4,Lots of Laughs!!!!,I can not remember the last time my husband and I laughed this much. You will laugh from begining to end.This would make a wonderful video to watch with a group of friends.The comedic cast is just great together.You won't go wrong with this video.
3,It's okay but suffers from bad timing,"This movie is okay. Just okay. Nothing outstanding and more than a few bad things. Most of the characters are likable, and they do get into some funny spots. It could have been a lot better but I'm not sure who to blame.It also, I think, suffers from some bad timing in the world. It seems a lot less funny now to mess around with an airport radar or dig around in a baby's pants. Airport sabotage and improper conduct with children jokes just are not so funny anymore, because of world events. I think the Hitler gag was just bad taste.I just bought this movie out of the blue. It's not bad enough for me to get rid of it, but I do not htink I would buy it again."
4,"This movie is by far, the craziest movie I have seen!","This movie was really crazy, but it was really funny also.I couldn't stop laughing at some parts. You must see this movie.There are so many funny parts. If your looking for a good laugh this movie is it."
4,Good kooky fun.,"Just a fun zanny comady. Don't think, just enjoy it. The cast worked well together. You can tell they had a great time making this movie. Cuba had all the best seens. Althow he is not a comidean, his timing is great. A great phycal actor. Woopie is great as always. Loved seeing Cathy Bates make an appirance. Would have loved to see maybe Jim carry do a camio. I had a good time watching this one. Sit back and laugh your head off."
4,great movie that didnt get proper DVD treatment,"This is a great movie, and it was a moderate success in theatres. Its weird then that they didnt pay extra attention to the DVD, and just threw something together instead. Theres no booklet to the DVD, just the scenes, and theres hardly any special features. Its worth the movie alone, because believe me, its one of the funniest movies ever. just pure slapstick and fish out of the water comedy. but this DVD is just... it saddens me that they totally ignored this movie with the DVD and jsut decided to put it out several months after its theatrical release. oh well, get it for the movie, not the DVD."
4,Very funny movie,"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. I found ""Rat Race"" to be a genuinely funny movie; this film had me laughing from beginning to end. Even though the characters and plot are a little thin, ""Rat Race"" is a very fun and entertaining movie."
5,An originally funny slapstick!!,"If you have a juvenile sense of humor and slapstick comedy makes you laugh --- GET THIS DVD!!!!It is truly hilarious.The slapstick is original, unexpected and with exceptional timing. It really keeps you rolling in the isles! Rat Race sports an all star comedy caste, including 3 academy awards winners (Whoopie Goldberg, Katherine Bates, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.)!We got it on a whim, and were in hysterics with laughter! I can't remember laughing that hard since watching ""Tommy Boy!"" for the first time.Also, the DVD features are worthwhile, but not overwhelming."
4,Funny Comedy!!!!,Rat Race is one of the funniest movies this year! It'll make you laugh until your stomach hurts! The cast was excellent and hillarious! A very fun film that will keep you tumbling down the aisle every second!
5,2 HOURS OF LAUGHTER,"This is one of the funniest comedies of the summer.I laughed for the entire movie. Unless you were born without a personality you will love this movie. The great cast includes Cuba gooding jr., whoopie goldberg, john cleese, rowan atkinson (Mr. Bean), seth green, dave thomas, wayne knight, vince vileuf, and a cameo by the band smashmouth. the ending was a little bit diffferent, but it was still good. go see this movie!!!!On a side note, everybody that i know that has seen this movie also loved it, even my grandfather!!!"
1,Zero stars!,"With John Cleese, you'd think it would be hilarious, but it's a waste of time. Get Life Of Brian or The Meaning Of Life for TRUE comedy."
1,Free associations from a childish mind,"Cynical and sad, the first adjective matches with comedies, but not the second one, this Zucker movie is not a movie in itself, but a couple of free associations whose IQ required to see it is less than a chimpanzee watching The planet of the ape. Some boring patrons and a excentric tycoon who run a casino choose by random a group of individuals who engage in a race to get 2 millions dollars. The individual zeal and greedy are overcome when they finally got the money and found a best and humanistic choice: donate dollars to a NGO, Feed the Earth. Along the lines of Farrely brothers but without their intelligence and class sensibility, Rat Race is neither a comedy nor a movie. Not only the characters are ""kidnaped"" by the director's free associations, but one is also trapped by it. The great difference is -if you are not a critic- that after being 15 minutes in the multiplex you can leave theater."
2,A Hilarious Race??,"I did not find this movie funny. Not only is this a so-so remake of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" or, if you like, a reimagining; some jokes are crude and the actors cannot save the film and they seem conscious of this."
1,WideScreen is no screen,I don't understand this whole widescreen idea. on a 19 inch tv you lose 1/2 your viewing space. the movie was funny enough but you buy a larger tv so that you can have a larger viewing screen only to lose it now with this widescreen ....Not a happy camper.!
1,worst movie of the year,"Went to see this movie with high hopes-what a disappointment! It was, without a doubt, one of the all time worst movies I have ever seen! Time magazine mentioned this movie in the same article as ""Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Talk about two opposite ends of the quality spectrum! I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie when it eventually comes to free TV!"
1,Pure garbage,"Don't waste yor time...Pure garbage. Unfortunately, I have to give it one star. I would have perfered to give it a big fat zero. Im glad I never bought this and only managed to sit through about 20 minutes of it one day when it was on T.V. Yuck!"
4,Hilarious comedy......!!!!!!!,Rat Race is a hilarious comedy based on a race on eight people trying to find money around the world.I think that Cuba Gooding Jr. was so funny and so different from his other movies that he will really make people laugh.
5,Rat Race,"This movie is one of my favorites, I have it in vhs so I decided to get it in dvd. This movie has a lot of funny actors and actresses in it. This movie will keep you laughing all the way thru. I have to pause it at times cause I am laughting so hard. It's worth it to buy it. I watch it over and over again."
4,"Great, funny movie",This is a great movie with a long list of stars. It is a movie that you can watchmore than one time and enjoy it again.
3,Guilty Pleasure!,"Many critics panned this film in its release. I felt that though it didn't have as much laughs as the Zucker Brothers & Jim Abrahams movies, it still had me stitches at the right places! Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) was great and so was Whoopi & Cuba. If you want to have a good laugh, consider watching this."
5,It doesn't get much better...,"I won't go into the storyline as there are plenty of reviews that do, but I will say that this move is make-your-side-hurt-from-laughing funny. I laughed so hard the tears were rolling. The humor is non-stop. In most comedies, the humor is spaced. Not here. It's non-stop momentum. I saw it for the first time last summer & I would still watch it anytime. Definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. John Lovitz is fantastic - but then so are all of the characters."
4,"Excellent movie, terrible ending","Rat Race is, without doubt, a hilarious film. It uses both slapstick and intelligent humor to elicit laughs, as well as the great Python John Cleese in the cast.Acting is very good, given that I hadn't even seen several of the actors in any other movies previously.So why not 5 stars? Terrible ending. I'm not sure if this is because of my dislike towards the particular band at the end, but I felt like the ending could have been so much better.Why anyone would want to enlist the ""help"" of this particular band, other than to get teen viewers, is beyond me.And it's not just that - the end was hardly a culminating moment for this film.Too bad, because otherwise, this is a five-star film."
5,superb!,from start to finish my sides were splitting with laughter. if there is a funnier film i want to see it.
5,This movie is very funny.,"This is a very funny movie,and it has some of the greatest stars in it.I especially like Rowan Atkinson because he is funny,and I have all his Mr.Bean tapes too. I cannot wait to buy this movie on DVD because it is a good movie."
4,Hilarious,"I'm so lucky to see the preview of this movie!!! I needed the laughs!!!!I can only tell you one thing: do not chew gum or candy while watching this movie, or you may choke on it. That's how funny this movie is!I love all the characters in ""Rat Race"". Each of them, small or big role, contributes something funny to the movie.You have to see this movie!!!"
2,Not worth buying,"I do not know where to start with my review. It is star packed and the star power definately keeps your interest throughout the movie. Unlike the many star packed movies out there, this one does have a few very hilarious scences. It reminds me in parts of Cannonball Run. However that is where the strengths and similarities end. With the exception of the ending I laughed. The movie begins to quickly unravel at the end. A movie that is humorous, interesting, and well written explodes like the Death Star at the end into an extremely lousy movie. The ending in this movie is horrible and makes the movie at best a mediocre rental. I would not recommend to anyone this movie as a purchase. At best, it is an alright rental."
2,An hour and 52 minutes of my life I can't get back,Terrible movie. It should have been funnier with the star studded cast but it fell flat. I wouldn't waste my time on this movie.
4,Gross out but fun,"Slapstick comedy at its very best. No depth, shallow comedy. The sort of party movie you like when you have downed a few...and dont like to think.Cows flying about, Jews dressed in Nazi attire, a guy sleeping standing, a vindictive squirrel saleswoman, a person who has lost his personality, a maverick helicopter pilot, a run-away heart,a disgraced referee driving a bus load of young grannies.....the characters and their quirks are too funny. Add some imaginative and outrageous scenarios with a feel-good ending...voila you have the perfect party film."
3,"Rat Race Good Film, DVD OK","The DVD contains normal features (scene selections, widescreen, animated menus, deleted scenes, etc.) but lacks some other important ones. It contains an anamorphic widescreen presentation of 2.35:1 (although the film was orginally 2.40:1), 6 deleted scenes, a gag reel, a 5 minute outtake scene, interview with the director & screenplay writer, JERRY AND ANDY CALL THE ACTORS, a pretty pointless audio feature, and a theatrical trailer, however it lacks the important AUDIO COMMENTARY and DVD-ROM features. It would be totally worth it if it had a commentary & possibly a screenplay viewer on DVD-ROM. The DVD also lacks any multi-language subtitles or language tracks whatsoever. Rent it before buying."
5,LAUGHED SO HARD I CRIED,"When I saw this movie in the theatre oh my gosh the people behind me were laughing so hard they were almost falling on top of me. My husband and I were almost on the floor. The theatre was packed and people were laughing so hard that you couldnt hear parts of the movie! :o) I had to make sure I bought it when it will be on DVD. It was that hilarious. My friends and I rate this movie 5 stars, the funniest movie of 2001. I bought this DVD yesterday and I am so glad I did! Love it Love it Love it~"
4,A treat for a Saturday matinee,"Top comedians - Mr. Bean, John Cleese (Fawlty Towers), Whoophi Goldberg and Kathy Najimi(Sister Act), Cuba Gooding Jr. to name a few; plus a lot of actions and fast, rythmic songs to match with it, the movie offers a wonderful past time for a Saturday afternoon.What I like best is the beginning, when the 6 groups knew of the race (very much like the reality show amazing race) to be the first to reach the 001 locker at a New Mexico train station for 2 million USD, they expressed disbelief and intention of not joining the race. How fast they changed their minds! The veteran comedians saved the movie from being a cliche.Though the ending is formulaic, the story plot is not boring and the songs inspiring, especially the opening theme song. Among its kind, Rat Race manages to be refreshing and entertaining. Perfect for a matinee."
2,RAT RACE DVD,"I GOT THE CORRECT MOVIE BUT IT WILL NOT PLAY IN ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS. ALL IT SAYS IN ALL OF THEM IS ""ERROR"". I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT BUT I CANT GET IT TO PLAY."
3,Lovitz a hoot,"I never thought I'd say this about any movie, but Jon Lovitz alone makes this comedy worth catching. Otherwise, the laughs are only spotty."
3,I'm not getting the video.,"Having heard that it was extremely hilarious I decided to check it out despite not being much of a comedy film. They base mostly on jokes than action or a good plot. This film was much of the same.A bunch of bumbling idiots at a high class Vegas hotel are selected to race to a small locker in Silver City, New Mexico. In the locker is a bag with 2 million bucks in it. Throughout there is far too many references to gambling and the Dallas Cowboys loss of the previous game. (Thanks to a near sighted referee who is, ironically, part of the race. The role is played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who completely wastes his talents.)In the end too many jokes fall flat, and those that don't just aren't extremely funny. It has a variety of famous actors (John Clease, Whoopi Goldberg) but overall they all wasted their talents. (Though some of the actors were at times hilarious, particularly Rowan Atkinson.) Though there are some bright moments, this is overall a very unremarkable movie"
5,Fun movie!,I loved Amy Smart's character in this movie! You'll understand what I mean when she crash lands the helicopter!The movie has some particularly funny scenarios...such as when the group of gamblers bets on ANYTHING....such as how long hotel maids can hang from curtain rods!Even good for kids....
3,Decent movie,"It was okay! Cool plot, nice ending, some funny parts but not really laugh out loud. Good family friendly comedy."
2,REDUX and predictable,"This seemed like a redux of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" done in the 60's. The cast is good but the movie is so so. There are some funny scenes but it didn't keep my attention."
3,"A modern version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""","It is boring to be rich. It must be, because the ultra-rich spend their time sitting around and placing bets on bizarre things: how long the serving staff can hold on to the curtain rod before letting go, how much a call girl will charge for participating in a bizarre bath, who will throw up first, and last, in a rocking Lear jet, and... the point of this slap-stick movie... which of a handful of ""ordinary"" people can make the trip to New Mexico from Las Vegas first and collect the $2 million waiting in a luggage locker.Let the race begin.This is not high drama, or even quality entertainment. However, you can't help but laugh when the jeep goes up instead of the radar coming down, a busload of Lucys are crying, and the WWII veterans reunion is interrupted.Consider this light entertainment, for the time you really need a chuckle or two."
4,This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years,"I laughed so much watching this movie, that I cried. I watch it every once in awhile and still laugh. Its difficult to get all the funny parts in one showing. The cast is great. I love Cuba Gooding Jr in this. I would recommend it if you want a good belly laugh!!!"
1,This movie was a waste of time and money!,"It is hard to imagine a more trite, hackneyed collection of sight gags and generally inferior acting than Rat Race. Intelligent movies get ignored while movies like this make big box office. God only knows why. This wouldn't even make decent television. I would rather stay home and clean my garage than see a stupid movie like this.Some movies are so bad they are funny. This is not one of them; Rat Race is just bad."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst comedies I have seen. Only Americans will like it, because they have no sense of humor!"
5,Non stop laughs,"It starts when 6 lucky gamblers win a golden token that is an invitation to participate in a race to Silver City, NM. The prize? 2 million dollars. And best of all, there are NO rules!Through helicopter, bus, donkey, train, cab, cars, and even hot air balloon the contestants will do anything to get the jackpot. There are so many funny situations that pop up during this race you'll be laughing an hour after the movie is over.This is definately the funniest movie so far this year..."
4,"""You Should Have Bought A Squirrel!""","Rat Race reminds me very much of the Cannonball Run movies of the early Eighties.Though not a masterpiece, it is a funny film, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The setting, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!"
4,"Okay, OKAY, OKAY!!!!!","Anticipated bathroom humor notwithstanding, and with a bit of an annoyingly ""preachy"" ending, ""Rat Race"" was much, MUCH funnier than I ever expected. While recognizing no depth of plot whatsoever, some of the sight gags had me laughing -- belly laughing -- out loud to the point of pain.My favorites? The squirrel lady, a bus-full of Lucille Ball impersonators -- and an hysterically funny flying cow -- complete with hot-air ballon!Not for the easily offended -- but, as such things go, fairly tame, even in the ""raunch"" respect.Certainly not ""Oscar"" material -- but, as previously stated, much funnier than expected. It's worth a couple of bucks and a couple of hours at Blockbuster."
5,"There is little more to say than ""see this movie!""","I didn't even want to see it, until my friend told me that he didn't think it looked good either, but he ended up seeing it and loved it. I was reluctant, but it was the only thing playing, so I went. This must have been the funniest movie of the summer! It's strange because it seems like a dumb movie, and some people would argue that it is, but in my eyes, it achieves comical brilliance. The ensemble cast was surprisingly proficient. I can't complain about the writing or the characters. And it was just so damn funny! I'm not going to give away the jokes, or talk about the obvious, simple plot, I'll just tell you that I wouldn't miss Rat Race."
5,Hysterical!!,One of the funniest films I have ever seen!! It was outrageously funny. The first time I watched it was at home on DVD. I was laughing so hard that I had to stop the DVD while I fell on the floor for about 5 minutes of hysterical laughter!! I highly recommend this film. It's absolutely brilliant.
4,Ignore the reviews,"I also had seen the trailer for this movie and was ""underwhelmed"" I went to a preview, and surprise, surprise! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very, very funny and well written. Amazingly clever. I very seldom go to movies twice, but I would consider doing so for this film. If you want to laugh out loud over and over-go see this amazingly clever flick."
2,Not very funny,This is really not worth the 1 1/2 hour investment. I just didn't think it was funny nor did anyone else in my house
3,Keep racing....,"I have put off quite some time to watch this movie, but was quite interested since Mr. Beans appears as a comedian here. I was not impressed at all, I did not find a laughable part at all; only when the guy with the wife & the kids steals the ""Hitler"" car and jumps on the stage and talks non-sense stuff.The movie's plot is quite senseless.They are in a casino, they get a gold coin from the slot machine and are sent to a locker in New Mexico with 2 million dollars.The characters were great, the selection was alright, but not their acting, script or role.I was quite dissapointed. It felt like a drag the whole way through."
3,Rat Race is not so funny...,"With this cast of comedic actors, I thought this movie would be funny, but I was wrong. It had a few funny scenes, but the funniest were the ones you saw in the previews. The movie was just stupid, but I gave it three stars, because I didn't get bored; and some scenes were funny. The funniest was Rowan Atkinson, but he didn't have a big part. Seth Green, his friend, Brekin Meyer, Amy Smart, and Whoopi Goldberg were funny in some scenes. If you are bored and have seen everything else out there and don't want to see a movie you've seen twice, than see ""Rat Race"", otherwise wait to video or dvd."
4,"SWEET, PRETTY AND MELODIC--A TRIUMPH","As a huge Morricone fan, I'm glad that I didn't overlook this soundtrack. In fact, back in the day, I purchased it on vinyl; I liked it more than enough to decide to purchase it on cd, as well. Melodically, this score does evoke some of his other work. However, texturally it is a bit different, round vs. angular. The orchestration is quite sweet on the score pieces. Overall, this is a fine, somewhat relaxing listening experience apart from the film. Ms. Zadora's singing is pleasant on the tune where she is featured. The great Edda Dell'Orso is wonderful on the one or two selections where she adds her beautiful vocal contribution. RECOMMENDED."
3,Just ok for Morricone,"The song ""Discipline"" has a catchy melody that just does not sustain long enough to give the listener the satisfaction of, say, Morricone's Once Upon a Time in America. It's tantalizing, but Morricone really needed to build the whole song around the melodic core, rather than drifting away from it. The rest of the CD is from the suspense music genre that most Morricone listeners just fast-forward past."
2,Not the same as in the picture,"I own a very old aurora tiger like the one in the photo. It has been shedding so I wanted a replacement. Unfortunately the one they ship is not exactly the same as the one in the picture. Instead, one they send is an uglier down grade in my opinion (has big eyes, and nose is not colored the same). I requested a refund, and thankfully Amazon gave me a no hassle refund."
4,you know what you're going to get with ean sicko...,"so, if you like the sicko song 'stephen' or 'a song about a rabbit' or 'three tea' then you will definitely [not to put words in your mouth] like this. it's what you would expect from the guy that got a mom tattoo. the record is sweet and endearing, it's got a big rock sound opposed to the lo-fi little amp with almost distortion that they are live. each song is ean at is his silliest, sweetest and best. if you like pop music then there is a good chance you'll like this. it puts the bubble in trouble and the wavy in gravy, or something like that. you should buy it from empty records though, only ten bucks post paid. great indie label laboring in the northwest. all the songs might sound the same to an untrained ear, but it's a swell song nonetheless."
4,O-L-Y-M-P-A,"Geez i love this cd! i do agree that the songs toward the end of the album sound the same, but they are great! Go Scooter Boy go! And Ean is the nicest guy in the greater seattle metropolis area!"
4,This album is has a great new sound.,"This is a refreshing dip into a new era for these three guys. The music, although it retains hints of the past, has an up dated feel to it. I look forward to more flights of the Baron."
2,This aint Sicko,"I bought this CD hoping it would be something like Sicko, one of my favorite bands. As much as I hate to say it, I was disappointed. You can tell it's one of the same guys doing the songs, but it's just not the same. This album sounds more like REM than Sicko."
4,Love Blooms by Christine Adams (Large Print Mills & Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:Nurse Rose Maslen loved her job working part-time for Fleetline Air Ambulance, even though baby Timmy limited where she could be sent abroad. Love had bloomed for Rose in the African desert, but she believed Timmy's father had been killed - until the new director met his staff. Dr. Nick Coleman - and Timmy's father. Clearly he was suffering from amnesia, about which Rose knew little. What should she do, when to confess all might make Nick worse?"
5,THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD,I think it was really cool how they took her out of the ocean and how she lived with dolphins. I disagree with the people who don't like this book. It's so awsome.
4,A Touching Story,"...This book is about a girl named Mila who speaks "" dolphin."" She goes to a doctor to see if she can identify human and dolphin things. The doctors and a son Justin do alot together to help Mila. They went sight seeing, Mila sees some dolphins and calls out her dolphin name but she didn't hear a reply. The doctors gave a reccorder to Mila and she loved it. The doctors and Mila found a note and it is from Mila's ... and her real name is ... Read the book to find out why Mila the way she is.You should purchase this book because it touches you heart. It touches your heart between the characters. This book is a loving story that you should read.You might want to bring some tissues while reading this book."
3,Easy Read!!,"This book did not have the most interesting plot line. Main points:*Reading Level according to Accelerated Reader: 6.0 (6th grade)*Point Size in this book is VERY large and gets bigger and smaller as you read*62 Chapters (one chapter is one sentence, some chapters are a pg)*Good book to read quickly!!"
4,Music of the Dolphins was Music to my Ears,"Music of the Dolphins, by Karen Hesse is a heroic book. The struggle Mila must go through to live with her dolphin family is tear-jerking. A young child is on a plane with her mother, and it crashes, killing the mother and leaving the child stranded on a small island. She is saved by a pod of dolphins and then lives there for 7 long years. She is found by the coastgard and sent to Boston, Mass. to study and rehabilitate. All Mila wants to do is go home to her aquatic family. Will mila ever make it back to the family that saved her from the craws of death? You must read the book to find out. I absolutely loved Music of the Dolphins. I think I look at animals differently now. I think anyone that likes animals, or wants a good book to read this is the one you should chose. You might even appreciate your life more, I sure have."
3,3 stars,"We give this book 3 stars because it didn't stand out. The girls in our class gave the book 5 stars, but the boys give it 3 stars. The book may not be too interesting for boys."
3,Something a Little too easy for Fourth Grade,"This book was a little too easy for fourth grade. But the way the author described everything was great! Even though some parts confused me at the end everything came together. Just because it was too easy for me, some kids might enjoy easy reading. I still rate this book 3 stars because it wasn't the best book ever, but it wasn't the worst so this is definitely a 3 star.(right in the middle!)"
2,An impossible plot: a girl taken from the wild to a hospital,"In Karen Hesse's novel The Music Of the Dolphins, a young girl is taken from the wild and brought to the world of people and placed in a government hospital. I found this book to be unreasonably horrible. There didn't seem to be a poit to it; a first grader could have predicted what was going to happen. Plus a young, teenage girl couldn't live in the wild with dolphins for thirteen years of her life. It would be impossible. She would have either starved to death or been eaten or critically injured by a large animal. Then to try to teach this girl the way of people wouldn't be successfull. I believe that if this could happen any attempts to recover her would fail."
3,"The Music Of Dolphins wasn't exactly ""music to my ears""","(I would really rate this book a 3.5, but that is not an option in the Rating System Amazon.com has.)The Music Of Dolphins was a respectable book, but not one of the best I've read. It was interesting to see how Mila progressed in her learning, but it still didn't strike me as so ""wonderous."" I can tell Karen Hesse worked hard on this project, but I also felt a strange feeling of been isolated when I read it, almost TOO isolated. Mila was so innocent and fragile - yet, it is not that hard to believe after coming from the ocean. It was a little hard-hitting, I suppose you could say. Some of my favorite parts of the book were when Hesse described Mila in the ocean, swimming with her dolphin friends. I compliment Hesse on this literature, but think she could write a better piece."
4,Artistically -- meant to be read aloud !,"There are many ways to discuss, appreciate & analyze this book. A lot of it is busily going on here among the reviews. I have been reading it to my fifth grader (boy) as a bedtime story. At first I had my doubts about the style, thinking it was perhaps dubiously precious or overly self-conscious. It is in fact pure poetry. Very interesting.I don't think my son considers it verse, the way he enjoys Richard Scarry's Nursery Rhymes or Dr. Seuss. I think he likes it for the simple and straightforward progress of the words. It is easy for him to follow, and he hasn't been falling asleep on me.So it works for both of us. Because it is so deceptively simple, I think one might read it too fast if one were not reading it aloud. Give it a try if you have the chance."
5,I thought that this was a really good book.,This book was about a girl who has been living with dolphins for about 10 years and some cost guards find her. This book theaches what problems being human can have and how sometimes less inteligent species have better lives than we do.
5,Marina's reveiw,I love this book Music of Dolphins by Karen Hesse. My favorite character is Mila because she is diferent from anyone else in the story. She always wants to be in the ocean and with the dolphins. The moral of this story is learning who you are and deciding what you want to become in life. The author writes very excitingly. She also makes you feel like you are with the people in the story. She makes you want to finish the book to see how it ends.
1,This book STUNK! If it got any worse I'd sue for neglagence,"Some girl lives with dolphins for about ten years. Then the coast gaurd found her. Big whoo-pee. Look, no matter what, DON'T read this book or you'll be sorry you did. It was that bad. So don't say you were never warned."
4,Music of the Dolphins,"I loved this book because I found it interesting to read about a person raised by dolphins since she was 4. Another part I found interesting was how she adapted to humans after living with dolphins so long. If you have ever wondered how a human would do to be raised by an animal, you would like this book."
4,Music of the Dolphins,I recommend Music of the Dolphins. I thought it was okay. Anybody who likes fantasy would like this book. How would you like to live with the dolphins? Read this book and find out.
3,"Well written, very well written","The Music of Dolphins was written well, but wan't the greatest book. It wasn't as good as Out of the Dust which was written by the same author."
4,If you like adventure you will love this book.,"The book The Music of Dolphins was a great book. The story is about a baby, girl, boy and a mother on a plane. They crash and perish at sea. Then, years later the girl is found to have lived many years under water. They send the girl, Mila, to work with two doctors, Doctor Beck and Sandy. They work with her on the computer. A little while later she gets a letter from her Dad to come meet her in Poland. You will have to read the book to find out the rest. This is a very good book. It is easy to read, too. I would recommend this book to a friend. Every once in a while the print changes shape and size. If you like adventures you'll like this book."
3,The adventures of the lost dolphin girl,"I'm writing this assignment for our 7th grade humanities class.I liked the description they used to describe each character. I disliked when they give almost everything away, like when she goes swimming she sees people in white and it's obvious their doctors. I liked the book because the author allows you to picture everything.I rated it 3 because it gives important beginnings and ends away, and also I thought they described everything that happens so you can just tell what the end is going to be. I loved the words the used to describe each character.I would recommend this book for second graders because some would like the sea and others the dolphins and its description."
3,Not realistic,"I liked the plot but it was very unrealstic. that could never happen. today we have to much technology and news coverage on events like that,search teams would not miss something or somebody like that for so long."
3,Not one of Hesse's best,This is a quick read beause a lot of the font is big and allthe words are simple. I liked the plot but not the way it was written.
1,WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!,I know everybody has their own differant opinion of how we liked books but I thought this book had absolutely no exciting part in it. The only reason why I got this book was becuase the title sounded really neat and so did the summary but it seemed like there was no end to this.
1,Music of the dolphans is ok,I rate this book with 1 star because it had big print and it seemed to me like a baby book. I liked the book a little because of the way she acted and the way she spoke.
4,Getting Sam Home,"Getting Sam Home is a must for any true Britcom fan. The antics of Compo, Clegg,Foggy and friends is in true British style, funny to the bone. This is Britians longest running comedy, 27 years, though new to American tv. So, pour yourself a pint, sit back, relax, and enjoy the Last of the Summer Wine."
4,Almost $3 per 24 hour rental?,"It's not HD, It's not available in your library for a rainy Sunday 18 months from now but it is THIRTY DOLLARS to watch Season II of A lesser known show that only clocks in @29 minutes a episode. I doubt they are paying Thomas Jane as well as Charlie Sheen so HBO/Amazon it's not the value menu at McD's nor the RuthChris steak house so charge a reasonable rate for some thing that's already aired and you may get enough customers to actually turn a profit."
3,Good show gone bad,"I was a fan of Season One even though it took quite a few episodes to find it's groove with me. Season Two was just plain bad. The finale of season one gave you the impression that Tanya was going to start getting tough and that never happened this season. It was basically her getting worse and more neurotic (if that's possible!), Ray in ridiculous or just plain boring situations. (Yes, I understand the concept of a coach turned gigolo is just as ridiculous but some things were just irritating.) Focused way too much on things that viewers are looking to escape from and there was no pay off in the finale. It gave me no reason to want to tune in to season three. I probably will for a few episodes just to see if the writers get their heads out of their rump and go back to writing something decent but this is just turning into as big a disappointment as this season of Weeds."
2,Simple premise long played out,"I enjoyed season one so much that I actually looked forward to spending my money to buy season two. Big mistake. Whatever it was that captivated me and my sweetheart about season one, was TOTALLY lacking in season two. I think season number one took a very unlikely premise that was replete with varous comic opportunities and made good use of them. Season two continued the established story but took it nowhere worth going.Probably one year passed from the time I had watched season one and the time I watched season two. Watching season two and being BORED right from the beginning made me realize how SHORT each season is, namely only 10 thiry minute episodes. I did not pay a lot for this series, but even so, the story line no longer delivered even modest entertainment. the 300 or so minutes was better than a BAD movie, but it did not live up what I have come to expect from the best of HBO when HBO is really delivering the ""goods."""
2,warm up the fast forward button,This series started out with an interesting premise but the writers could not carry it out to what it could have been.What the actors were forced to say and do is sometimes not believable.(on second thought perhaps it's the acting) I found myself fast forwarding to the next scene.I bought all three seasons and it never really improved that much.
3,Unique story line.,Entertaining and easy viewing. Just fun and different than anything else on TV. Similar to Eastbound and Down for comedy.
2,"Not the movie shown in the graphic above, but not bad!","This is a pretty good ""late night"" soft-core flick -- lots of beautiful women, inoffensive men, and generally good production values (lighting, sound especially). I'd give it 3 stars if only the script didn't feel cobbled together by committee, and someone wasn't paying attention in the editing room: too often, hairstyles change in the same scene!One other reason to see this one: the gorgeous Kim Yates, always nice to see. When you add Kira Reed and Kim Dawson, you've got a near all-star cast going (although a little girl-girl action would have been nice too!)."
5,Finest Pianist in Japan,"Kuni Sugano is one of most talented pianists with originality in Japan. ""The days of wine and roses"" which swings like this are new. The live is famous and tells a sufficiently pleasant performance also here. It is the player of only one player in response to the influence of Erroll Garner."
3,A Flashback to the Campy 60's,"If your looking for transport back to the days of ""camp"", then this CD's for you. Listening to it reminds me of my ""One-Adam-12"" and ""Emergency"" days. A most for those of us born in the late 50's, early 60's!"
4,Great Fun,"A friend and I planned a trip to Houston around this book. The whole weekend was devoted to haunted places--so why eat in a regular, non-haunted restaurant? You get a nice history of the building and its previous uses (if any), the folks who used it while in the flesh, and those (in spirit) who are purported to inhabit it now.If you enjoy this kind of thing (and I do), use this very handy book to add some interest and variety to a trip or just find new ''haunts'' in your own city. Most haunted places are also historic or older buildings, so you get an extra treat in seeing some unique architecture. So even if haunted isn't your thing, but historic is, this is a great book.Be sure to call first to verify hours and if the building is still standing. Unfortunately, one highly haunted tavern in Houston was bulldozed to make room for a modern bookstore. When traveling to any city in Texas, I will always consult this book for unique and special places to enjoy food or a beer."
5,Boogie Oogie Yes,"Every time I think of A Taste of Honey, the only song that comes to my mind is Boogie oogie oogie. These ladies were one of many pioneers of disco. They may not be around anymore,but for groups such as the Village people, the Bee Gees and a Taste of Honey, it's proven that disco has made a comeback. If you really want to relive the days of disco,then this is one CD you definitely don't wanna pass up!"
3,boy loves dog/dog loves boy,"young andrew thornton has wanted a dog for as long as he can remember but,where he lives with his parents,there are NO dogs allowed.one day andrew finds a dog and names him ""scruffy"". a neighbor helps andrew hide scruffy,then he hides the dog in an abandoned car in a field. andrew really loves scruffy and does his best to feed and take care of him,but scruffy gets very sick-feverish and seems to the point of death! andrew searches frantically for a vet to help scruffy. is andrew too late? what will happen to scruffy?"
1,Awful,"I bought these shoes from Eastbay. They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life. After wearing them for less than a week, I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin. There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes. As you walk, it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable. I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product."
2,Junk,"I was very disappointed with this book. I read the reviews beforeI ordered it. The preface is by Jeff Green, how could you go wrong?I honestly felt this book was right out of La La Land, he made no sense to me at all. I have an entire library of astrology books and this one doesn't even merit making it to the shelf in my opinion. I know my own chart inside out and upside down and when you can't even recognize the references to common things in your own chart...something isn't right.I'm sorry, I was highly disappointed by his information and I really did not care for his writing style. Waste of money if you ask me."
1,another sanitized job by the lincoln mafia,"get a copy of The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln by C.A. Tripp and read about the real lincoln, the lincoln who was homosexual. Boy, has it been hard to get this story out there and told truthfully. mind you this book was written a while back, but i'll bet the other reviewers are part of the mafia out to squelch the truth."
5,A beautifully written book,"Over a half century after this book appeared, it is still the standard by which all one-volume Lincoln biographies are measured, and a reminder of how much we lost by the author's premature death when he was just hitting his stride as a Lincoln scholar and writer."
4,Good but wrong,"Internet sales was great to deal with very friendly staff. Was wrong cover for my truck, and yound lady at Internet Sales was great. Very dissapointed that had to pay 10% for Restocking fee though. Cost me over $60 adn couldnt even use it! But people there are very friendly and would purchase from them again, just review your order before hitting enter!"
3,"Not quite what I expected, but good product","This book arrived in good condition and within the estimated delivery window. However, I was expecting a full-sized children's book, and was mildly disappointed to discover that this book is about 2 square inches in size and therefore difficult to read to a child (which was my intention in purchasing it). Bummer."
4,Little book,"This book is very small, but hardcover. My kids enjoyed the story anyway and got them to read it without a fight because it was so little. Still had 30 pages though, I believe. Anyway, cute little book - just get it when it's on sale for $1 like I did."
4,Great Book,"This is such a nostalgic book for parents to see. I am a 4k teacher. I used this book for the kids to ""read"" the pictures one day, then watched the movie the next day. I loved it that many were not familiar with the book but loved the movie."
2,Re-illustrared for your displeasure...,"Um, don't really know who Paige Braddock is, or what she's doing here. When I was young there was a book adaptation which featured artwork from the tv special itself, including Snoopy's wild dogfight with the Red Baron. Tough to support a ""newly re-drawn"" version, especially one that's done after the creator's passing."
3,Ugly Ducklings - 'S. N. A. F. U.' (Other People's Music) 3 1/2 stars,"Two sources I've seen (including Amazon) has noted this CD as a title from the Nervis Brothers. 'S.N.A.F.U.' looks to be Canadian's own Ugly Duckling's thirty-some years follow-up to their 1966 'Somewhere Outside' lp - their sole album (see my review). As I searched on the Internet, I found that the Ducklings indeed have a compilation or two out and currently still available. In their initial existence - they look to have put out several 7"" singles out and had one Top 40 hit through out Canada. With this 'S.N.A.F.U.' - tunes I thought were happening were ""That's What You Said"", ""The Only One"", ""No Fear"", the rather upbeat ""No Brains Today"" and the catchy ""Time Well Wasted"". Be sure to go to You Tube and seek out videos of their comeback. Not bad."
2,Don't know the players at my age,"I picked up this book because it's a ""classic"" baseball book. But here's the thing, at age 30 I just don't know who these players in the book are unless it's Mickey Mantle or other big stars. The author does a good job writing about everyones backstory, but without the familiarity of some of these names I just can't keep interest. Sure there are parts about the big stars and Mickey Mantle, but there is a lot of the book that documents the other parts of his career and I just can't relate as well."
2,Inside baseball,"He told it like it is with some ego mixed in. He is obviously intelligent, not the usual sports jock."
5,You Will Read This Book More Than Once,"This is not a 'sports book'. It is a people book. It is about struggling pitchers trying to make a living back before million dollar salaries. This book never fails to make me laugh, no matter how many times I read it."
1,This book is NOT autographed as indicated in the image accompanying the book.,"Image accompanying book is misleading. Book is not autographed, and Amazon never was able to explain why erroneous image was included or to produce an autographed book. Did refund purchase price and postage. Disappointing."
4,Still a fun read,"Interesting book. Hard to believe it was so controversial when it was written, but it is a 40-year old book now. First of its kind. Really enjoyed he incremental updates as well."
4,Ball five,A very interesting book about the behind the scenes baseball life. Not as shocking as when it was published because of all the exposures on baseball in the press today
5,The Real Thing,"I read this book when it first came out. I wasn't surprised. I wasn't shocked. My thought was, ""This is the real thing."" That was the thought of millions of other readers, too, and still is today. In a sport which has tried for well over a century to paint itself as above reproach -- a sport whose owners have never accepted responsibility for being the ones who banned African-Americans from baseball, for example -- Bouton cut through the lies and told things as they were. He shows what the players think and do on the field, in the locker room, and in the rest of their lives. Bouton's love of the game is palpable: it does grip him, just as his story grips the reader. A Must Read."
5,No Strikes Here,"One of many excellent baseball books I have read. Jim Bouton's personality had you rooting for him all along. In a world that sometimes takes it's sports to seriously, a determined Jim Bouton was able to make it fun while he was living his dream."
4,Hilarious look at baseball,"Even aside from its baseball aspects, Ball Four probably deserves recognition as the funniest string of anecdotes ever put on paper. There really isn't much that can be said about this book that isn't positive; hilarious, a quick-moving style of writing, interesting stories, and a great picture of what life in a clubhouse is really like. Bouton's limited observations on politics and individuality on a team are interesting, even if they're dated by now. The only drawback to this book is that it won't impact a reader today as it would someone who read it at its publication. For someone like me who has grown up with public salary negotiations and open discussion of the private lives of athletes, there's no shock value or revelation to be had. Nevertheless, even if it's no longer groundbreaking, it's still more than a worthwhile read for anyone."
2,book review,"not a great bookthought i would like it afteer listedning to the author on the eradio, but i was wrong"
3,I expected more...,"With all the uproar this book caused in 1970 when it came out, I expected more. More controversy. More about Mickey Mantle. More about loose morals on the road. Jim Bouton is a funny guy, there's little question of that. From the book, I get the tone that he's quite an egotist as well. He has many self-depricating remarks in the book, but after a while, I came to believe he thinks too highly about himself. There are some great stories about ""beaver shooting"" and other games that ballplayers play that I thought were hilarious. As well, seeing behind the scenes of a baseball season was neat. But I wanted more of the scandalous stuff."
1,not so new,"If I remember correctly, this book was supposed to be used, in 'like new' shape. It came to me yellowed (yes I know, 40+ years old), but also dirty and worn. I would have judged it as fair condition only."
1,Revolting!,"I purchased this book thinking it would be interesting to read what it's like to be a baseball player. I read maybe only 1/4 of the ball four section of the book, & was so incredibly disgusted, & appalled!! What a horrible dirty way to live, & I understand he was wanting the reader to know how their life really was, but Bouton thinks the disgusting lifestyle is funny, & obviously enjoys telling about it. The language is so incredibly vulgar & filthy page after page, that I quit reading it because I felt so filthy. It could be that they talked that way, but why would you want to continually repeat that kind of language! I read parts from Ball 5 to the end of the book, & Bouton definately cleaned up the language & the vulgar way of living on this section, but then to continue with Ball 6, & onward? Bouton is definately someone who can't let go with that time of his life. This was definately not worth the .99 I paid for it!"
2,Ball Four,"I thought it was very funny when I first read it, but the attitude that he can trash so many other people is a little hard to take. He apparently made no attempt to understand Mickey Mantle but felt okay about slamming him for drinking too much and yet wanted to make sure everyone knew he (Bouton) was a great guy for supporting civil rights and adopting a kid. The book was an attempt to copy ""Instant Replay"", but somehow Bouton and his editor thought it was okay to put in many negative comments about people who can't respond. It's no wonder so many people in baseball hated him after this. He seemed to think he was ""telling it like it was"" but to dump on teamates who can't respond is pretty low. With friends like Bouton you don't need enemies. I think he could have been just as funny without going out of his way to try to hurt people."
2,For academics,Although this may be an extensive and erudite history of sexual humor be forewarned: it is a textbook. This massive and well researched tome would be perfect in a classroom setting or for the academic looking more to indulge in esoterica than humor.
2,For Morrison Fans Only!,"I love Morrison's work generally, but this book was not her best. There are flashes of excellent work but unfortunately it seems that Morrison's genius evaporated with her Nobel Prize. Hopefully her next will be better!"
3,"To read or not to read, that is the question.","After spending half an hour reading all the diverse commentaries on this book, I can't decide whether to read it or not. Maybe I'll sleep on it for a day or two. To the 18 year old from Toronto and the February writer from Michigan, ""soaly"" is spelled s-o-l-e-l-y."
5,"I didn't get it, but Oprah liked it so it must be good.","After watching Oprah, I decided to read this book. While I didn't enjoy it very much, I think the fault lies with me. I must not be smart enough to understand it. I'm going to read it again and maybe I'll enjoy it more."
2,Lost in Pardise,"Never have I wanted to get out of Pardise so bad. It has taken me appox. ten months to finish this book, because i have a warped sense of having to finish a book before starting a new one. My New Year's resolution was to read 12 books this year (one a month) I would have had better luck with a diet. The story being portrayed here had great potential, but I think maybe Miss Morrison was cooking or on the phone and forgot where she was and so did I."
3,What?!--What is this book about?,"Come on Toni, are you kidding? In the beginning the book is intriguing. There was so much potential. Soon, however, the confusion becomes unbearable and the story becomes unrealistic and silly. Don't start. You'll be disappointed."
2,Somebody should have shot me first,"I tried, I really tried to get into this book, I even read some chapters over. I read slowly, but to no avail. It was like a manic depressive nightmare with not a very good plot. I agree that Toni Morrison does have a way with words but what about the rest that goes with a good read. But that is why there are so many good books out there for us, to keep us looking for a good read and we all read differently. Thank god for that."
1,Confusion reigns in Paradise,"Morrison's new novel begins, ""They shoot the white girl first."" After that opening statement, it's all downhill. E.B. White once equated fine writing with clarity and simplicity. If indeed these two qualities are the mark of exemplary writing, Morrison's Paradise fails terribly. This tale is twisted and convoluted. There are no turns of phrase that strike this reader (a university literature professor) as exemplary and extraordinary. My thoughts, as I read this work, were thus: (1)if it had been written by a newcomer, it likely would not have been published and (2) Ms. Morrison has probably reached the stage in a literary career when awards and accolades intimidate editors and most reviewers from offering an honest appraisal. In short, confusion reigns in Paradise and, unless you have ample time to waste, it is a book best left on the shelf."
1,too heavy,"I am nearly finished with this book, and I still waiting for Ms. Morrison to finally disclose what she is trying to say. I want to read novels for comfortable enjoyment. This book certainly doesn't meet that criteria. It is more in line with a heavy college textbook. I would certainly not recommend it for relaxed reading."
1,WHAT?????,"I had heard Toni Morrison say that you should continue to read this book even if you didn't understand it. I finally gave up. Two-thirds of the way through I still had absolutely no idea what was going on, nor did I care about any of the characters. I really hated this book."
3,Complex and thought provoking,This is my first experience with Toni Morrison's works and I must say that it was indeed a challenge to complete and in some spots to comprehend the underlying meaning in the way she worth this novel. There is no way for me to compare this to her works or any other writers works for that fact because she is truly in her own realm. Now with this being said I must admit that I enjoyed the challenge in the reading of Paradise and even though it's not MY idea of PARADISE it was to the citizens of Ruby and that must be respected. I will not try to sway you one way or the other into reading this novel but I will say that if you are looking for a thought-provoking novel with twist and a couple of turns this is indeed for you.
3,complex and engaging,"This is a huge book encompassing human fear, love, sex, religion, and destruction of society. The story is of women and color and society. Morrison writes in strong, intelligent language. The story slips in and out of space and time fluidly. It's complex and engaging. Not an easy read but worth it."
3,Too much information?,"I was interested in this unique story from the first page, but as it unfolded, I felt a bit perplexed. Instead of having a pencil and paper to decode the family trees involved (as I probably should have) I was mopping sweat from my forehead. I almost felt as if I were reading the section in Genesis ""Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot.."" and so forth. But, these people were definately not biblical.The elements of the ""supernatural"" incorporated in the book were OK, but I felt they were just kind of thrown in there to make things a bit more mysterious. On the surface, it's the story of a close-knit (almost incestuous) society who has a cult of outsiders living near their town.Although the meat of the novel was tough going, I did enjoy the finale. Through all the tumult within, I was uplifted by the end. I wouldn't call this one of Ms. Morrison's best, and it's not ""The Bluest Eye"". But, I'm not giving up on her."
3,Is Paradise Lost?,"I must preface my review by admitting I've only read Paradise once.The writing is the same brilliant and disorienting/nonlinear style as the rest of Morrison's oeuvre. What seemed most aberrant in her first post-Nobel Prize novel was, though it was highly intellectually stimulating, for me ""Paradise"" lacked the connection to the heart that is inseparable from her previous books. It seemed to try to meet expectations the public would have of a Nobel Prize Laureate. (Who can blame her? She remains a wonder.) But to me it was a bit forced, especially with an (overly?) dramatic opening line ""They shoot the white girl first.""I will read any novel Morrison writes, they are all worth reading, including Paradise, but if you are new to her, you would be best off starting with Song of Solomon, Sula, and then Beloved."
5,Amazing,"This book sat on my ""to read"" stack for over a year. I kept hearing that it was rough sledding, but I finally picked it up and was completely enthralled. In fact, I'd say it was a page-turner. The book is something of a jigsaw puzzle, so it's important not to get frustrated when you don't know exactly who is who. After about 100 pages the pieces start falling into place and that makes it especially satisfying to read. (I recommend keeping a pencil and paper handy to jot down relationships on a family tree as they become clear.) Don't be put off by this, it's one of the great pleasures of Morrison's writing--in addition to her wonderful language and vast imagination."
4,Best listened to on audio while following in the book.,"I was 3/4 though reading the book when I realized I could not remember who was who, or what the chronology was. Desperate to be prepared for my book club meeting, I borrowed the audio tape with Ms Morrison reading. It was magnificent! Six plus hours and four tapes later, I closed the book, shut off the taoe, and said to myself, ""What a fantastic story!"""
2,"The ingredients of greatness strewn about, but not blended","I have read many black author's fictional works, including Toni Morrison's in the past. Most of these books were enlightening and original. Paradise was original, but also disjointed and confusing.In this fairly slim volume, the characters of an entire town are mentioned. Some of these characters are described. Only one , Connie, is fully characterized. If you want to take a stab at writing about Ruby as a large backdrop canvas against which certain dramatic events later take place, you just have to use more words to satisfyingly convey this town, this black American MIDDLEMARCH, with it's many people and it's amazing history---It really saddens me that Ms. Morrison did not take more time with this book and produce the truly great work of fiction that Paradise could have become"
1,what was the point?,Hard to read. I question whether some of the sentences are grammaticaly correct. Should have been a short story instead of a novel. Last of Oprah's picks I'll be reading. Very disappointed.
2,For intellectual wanna-bes,"I love how all of the people who claim to like and understand this book focus their reviews on insulting the intelligence and sophistication of readers who did not like it. If these people were so intellectually superior, they would focus their critique on the substance of the book and not feel the need to attack the intelligence of those of us who did not care for this book. I posted a review two months ago begging someone to explain the ending of this book to me. No one has been able to. After reading such childish reviews, I am proud to be in the ""simple minded"" category."
3,"A book about a fallen ,Utopia","Paradise may be found on this earth.Each individual has a choice to make. It is common for all to seek an utopia. The pursuit was a worthy one from Haven to Ruby. But possession usually brings disillusion. Ethnic cleansing even in today's world is still exercised. The funding for the Arts and Science in Charlotte was abolished to purify the city morality standards. The attack on the convent is representative of this ignorance. The disappearance of the bodies was thought provoking. The author attempts to tie up the loose ends by the characters coming back""to love begun"". This reader feels the author should have edited and revised more. Perhaps she had a deadline to meet. Ele Mae"
4,the measure of literature today,"Toni Morrison has, I think, written a book which defines literature today. Through the non-linear narrative and the ethereal prose, Paradise provokes the reader to extend, expand herself in order to read in a new way. I was moved by the spirituality of her prose and the realization of the profound price of both faith and freedom.The novel isn't as solid as I had expected, and I was left feeling that the promise of the opening sequence was not fulfilled."
5,A very complex and mulitlevel literary wonder,"I do not find many books to be interesting and stimulating enough to even write a review about them. However, this book is a very exquisite piece of fiction. If you are reading these reviews and have doubts about this book, please read it. There are so many symbols, and various structural levels to the book that a less experienced reader would find it impossible. If you consider yourself a sophisticated reader, you will certainly love this."
2,sanity saved,"I thought perhaps I had lost abilities to comprehend and enjoy reading as I plowed through these stories.I have read Morrison before too! The style did not spur me on; just diligence. I think I understand it, caught sub ideas, etc.,but mostly bored by her characters, but surely am glad to be done with it. No wonder the owner loaned it and said ""...don""t worry about getting it back to me...""."
4,"""Good"" doesn't have to be ""easy.""","My book club just finished reading Paradise, and I was the only one who liked it (and one of only a few who finished it.) I was also the only one who took the time to jot notes as I read, so that I could keep track of the characters and story. It didn't take anything away from the reading experience to take these notes. On the contrary, it enhanced it immeasurably. I was disappointed in my clubmates for giving up so easily. I would have liked for them to all have finished and understood it, so I could discuss it with them in the thorough manner it deserves. Yes, it was a difficult book. No, difficult does not equal bad. Have we as a society lost our love of a challenge? Are good things no longer worth working toward? I thought it was a mesmerizing story because I understood it. I didn't understand it because of my intellectual superiority, but because of my work ethic."
4,Worth It,"This is the first Toni Morrison book I've read, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was hard for me to find a groove in reading Paradise. First, there are SO many characters and names and family ties etc. Second, there were plenty of subplots. As I was reading, I had to take several breaks because it was hard to digest all the information. I was actually stressed about this book. Was it only me that had difficulty in reading this book?With that said, I would like to say that all the stress was worth it in the end. At the half way mark, I was able to put info together and it started getting good. I really felt for all the female characters in this book, as well as a couple of the male characters. I won't give any spoilers, but the two characters who were almost star crossed lovers was the biggest subplot surprise. I was really rooting for them in the end, although it definately wasn't rational.Great read if you stick with it."
5,Toni Morrison's best work to date!,"I have read some amazing books by this woman, but I think Paradise is her best piece of work. It is a mixture of Faulkner, Rushdie and Ms. Morrison's established style of writing. I found myself as equally fascinated as the characters in her book about the phrase ""Be the furrow of His brow"" or ""Beware the furrow of His Brow"". The difference in meaning is huge and I think central to the main event of the book - the gunning down of the ""outsiders"" in the convent. Morrison shows the danger of obsession - be it obsession with a human being, race or religion. There is a thin line between being extremely religious/godly and becoming a self-appointed ""God"". I think this book demonstrates that well and I would encourage any serious readers of English literature to read this! To those who enjoyed it, may I recommend Salman Rushdie's ""Midnight's Children"" to you - another excellent piece of literature."
4,"powerful, yet no Beloved.","i fully enjoyed paradise. yes, it is difficult to get through, and yes she can be vague at times. i think that is the beauty of toni morrison's writing style though. you must be patient and you must be able to sit down, give the book your full attention and read it slowly. to enjoy the full meaning of her books you cannot read them fast. they are slow moving books that need patience. it is also definately not a writing style that all appriciate or enjoy. i would not recommend this book to a person who hasn't read a book in awhile or is not used to reading a modernist or postmodernist style of writing. without being used to non-linear plot lines, i cannot imagine being able to follow paradise. yet, if you can get through it, and appriciate it, it is definately worth it. toni morrison is one of the most gifted writers today and every book i read of hers is a different, rich, amazing joy. to all who haven't read beloved, which thus far, is my personal favorite."
2,Not what I expected,"I was eager to read this novel after hearing so much about it. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I was told the book was ""a hard read"" and quite frankly I resented that label. I consider myself an intelligent person, capable of following and understanding a novel. However, I am embarrassed to admit that I truly did not understand a lot about the book. There were far too many characters, their lives and names all got mixed together and I had to keep going back to past chapters to get them straight. I kept reading and telling myself that somehow at the end of the book all of this will come together and make sense. Needless to say none of it did. Also, Connie's ""powers"" totally eluded me. Somehow I was not expecting something like that to enter into the story. I suppose I should read it again but I know I never will. I resent having to read a novel twice in order to understand it. Having said that I can only wonder why so many are calling it ""her best book yet""."
1,Very difficult to follow due to poor writing style,"To fully grasp the meaning of what's written in this book, you would have to read and study each page like you were reading Shapespeare. It's not Shakespeare, however, just bad writing.I wouldn't complain had it not been for Oprah Winfrey's statement that it was the best book she ever read. It was one of my worst.Paragraps go to two pages, thoughts ramble dreamlike, character development is spotty and her thoughts from inside the male mind laughable. It could have been good, but fell well short of the goal."
4,Did I have to re-read chapters 1-3 twice? Yes...,"...but once you get the hang of the structure, it gets a little easier to follow. I did not say easy, just easier. But if you read Toni MOrrison, you have come to expect a few challenges. When I finished I was pleased with the novel. It still stands as one of my favories. The prose, characters and the whole tone of the book are distrubing, but necessary to really understand the struggle these women, the town and our history had to have faced. It all culminates in a little suspense and a big surprise in the end-- that you may or may not expect or understand. But take a chance, a little confusion is good for the soul."
1,vague,"this seems to be a very difuse narrative, after reading part of it i had to put it down with a sense of not knowing what i was reading. the people in the story seem to have lost connection and the tale is hard to follow"
1,"Oprah, what were you thinking?","I, along with many of your readers, found this book to be very disjointed and difficult to read. Many of the characters were poorly developed and their relationships quite unclear. The plot, while brilliant in its intentions, was slow to unfold and had glaring holes. Basically, I enjoyed one chapter and am sorry I finished the book (always waiting for it to finally get interesting)."
1,Awful,I'm an avid reader & usually can't put a book down until I finish it. This one I couldn't wait to put down. The scenes/characters changed without any tranisition. I had to force myself to finish reading it.
2,Please no movie!,"This has to be one of her worst. She must have combined about 5 brainstorms of book topics and wrote one book. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Toni's but come on!!!!Toni, Toni, Toni. I'll give it one star since I was crazy enough to buy it and another for attempting to read it. There is no way on God's green earth, that this could become a movie. If anyone even thinks about it, I'll play one or more of the many characters myself. Just to see how far it goes and get a good laugh out of the cast confusion."
2,A tough read...,"The first ten pages where great. Then she lost me. The weaving story structure left me with indiscernible characters lacking motivation for almost everything they did, and a shifting plot I could never get my head around. Toni leaves far too much for the reader to decipher, and this makes the read laborious and slow.There are several points in the book however where her talent cannot be denied. Unfortunately, I did not feel it was worth wading through two hundred or so other pages to find said points. She had the makings of another masterpiece if she had been a bit more patient and willing to bring focus to many of the fog-laden chapters."
3,Interesting Book,This book has bits and pieces which is not possible to analyse at the first time. Everytime we read there is something new to discover. It is a good book.
2,I'm not ashamed to admit I didn't get this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I heeded all of the warnings , took this book very slowly, kept track of all of the characters, took notes, went back to previous chapters to understand characters and situations. I thought I was doing very well until I got to the end. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT! I didn't get it! I felt that all of my hard work and time had been wasted. Please somebody explain to me what the ending was all about! I am an avid reader and take great offense to previous readers claiming that If you didn't like this book, you're not intelligent. To the charming 18 year old reader who basically said that if you don't like this book you're stupid, soley is spelled s-o-l-e-y not soaly. Honey, just because you claim to like and understand an Oprah recommended book, it doesn't make you intelligent or mature."
1,"If this is considered great literature, just shoot me!","I read this book based on Oprah's declaration, ""It was the best book I've ever read"". Well Oprah you lost credibility with me. It was the worst book I've ever read. I deplore Tony Morrison's writing style. Why can't she just SAY IT! Who wants to read a book three times to finally GET IT? Her nuances are simply not that interesting. Next time Oprah recommends one of her titles, I'll simply say, ""YUCK""!"
1,Most over-hyped book-EVER!!,"I recommened this book for my book club, and was absolutely humiliated and embarrassed that I wasted everyone's time with this selection.What a waste of $28..."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I would've never read past page twenty if I wasn't forced to read this for my college English class. For a writer as prestigious as Tony Morrison one would assume that she has mastered the craft of novel writing. But it is clear that Tony Morrison still doesn't understand how to develop a strong plot as well as a clear theme. The story is misguided from the beginning as Morrison jumps back and forth from the town of Ruby and the characters of the convent. There are a million undeveloped characters and a number of confusing family trees. Morrison leaves it up to the reader to follow along with her shaky stream of consciousness, leaving the reader overwhelmed and bored. It is obvious that Morrison has taken advantage of her place as literary master. She has used her popularity and prestige to sell another book. All I can say is that I am glad I checked this book out at the local library instead of wasting money at the university bookstore."
2,What On Earth....?,"I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for ""The Bluest Eye"". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with ""Beloved"", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through ""Love"" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in ""The Bluest Eye"", ""Sula"" and ""Song of Solomon""."
2,Paradise Review by Stephanie Hamilton,I read Paradise for a project in my English class. The book was very difficult for the fact that it seems like Toni Morrison switched topics every few pages. With all of the different characters coming in and out of the convent and the town it was hard to keep up with what was going on with who. I just didn't care for the book at all. If i had to tell someone whether they should read the book I would definitely tell them not to read the book.
2,Difficult to finish,I hate to dedicate so much time to finish a book that I really don't enjoy but I did finish this book. I was just sure it was going to get better. After I was done my only thought was Hmmmmmm.
3,I haven't even finished it yet.,"I started this book over a year ago. I have read everything that Toni Morrison has ever written, and I am determined to get back to this one as well. Ms. Morrison is a fabulous writer who knows how to weave a tale like no one else I have ever read. Her ability to develop characters and to tie them together in a way that is both cohesive and entertaining is wonderful. I was amazed when I read the reviews of this book at how people berate the book and each other because they ""don't get it."" Although I have not finished this book it was not because it was too difficult, I simply could not maintain my interest in it. It is not the best book that I have read by Ms. Morrison (""Sula"" was), but I am determined to start again from the beginning, since it has been a whole year since I picked it up, and then finish this book. At that time I will review it, but I needed to put my two cents in now."
2,Beyond Her Skills,The author attempts something even good writers would find difficult. Her minimal talent fails her and the reader. The result is even worse than her usual.
4,"hard read, but worht the effort","Altough the first paragraph grabs your attention, the book is difficult to get thorough. Lots of names to remeber and sort out and the chronology jumps around alot. I think this is the best way to write a book though. Everything makes sense at the end, but ther is still questions to be answered with a second and even a third reading that really makes this a great book"
2,Read at your own risk!,"Morrison's story is brilliant, the characters are beautuful and the description's are breathtaking but the presentation makes Paradise nearly impossible to read. I had to struggle through the first few chapters to even find the strenght to continue reading this book. The telling of this story is confusing at best- and she interweaves past, present, good and evil before establishing any form to the characters Don't belive most of the early press reviews- they sound like they were writen out of the publishers ads and not by somebody who actually took the time to read this book. I stop short of calling this terrible, and only so because Paradise has tremendous potential to be all that it has been promised to be. Unfortunalty, Morrison's genius is blinding to both her story telling and those trying to read this book. I'm ,sorry, but I must disagree that if it must be read over and over before understanding- that does not make it automatically wonderful."
4,Paradise Lost,"The best opening sentence I have read. The prose at times is pure poetry. Reading this book takes concentration, though. It is like putting together a puzzle. At times I was unclear and confused about what piece I was looking at. Then the images would become clearer and the piece of the puzzle would fall into place. I enjoyed this book even though I was often confused about where I was in the story and who I was reading about."
1,This book was not ata ll what I expected it to be.,"I found out about this book through the Opra Winfre Show. This book was not at all what I expected it to be. I have tried reading and re-reading the book. This is one book that I feel that I have wasted my money on. I only bought it because Opra recommended it, and I thought Opra has good books to read in her book of the month club. Oh well, you can't win them all."
1,I didn't like this book.,"I am possibly in the minority, but I just didn't like it. I didn't think the author tied information together. I tried to keep going, like Oprah said, because the beginning is hard. I never found that it got easier or better. It was not a good read."
1,PAINFUL,Ms. Morrison's command of the language is impressive-this particlar book is not. I have read and enjoyed the author's other books; this was a punishment for something that I did not know I had done!!!! If there was a lesson to be learned I must have missed it somewhere between pain and suffering:My own!
2,Not worth the effort,"I've read most of Toni Morrison's work and anticipated the release of Paradise. I should learn not to set myself up like that. More complex and enigmatic than any of her other novels, Paradise waits far too long before giving the reader enough frame of reference to appreciate what's going on. The characters are interesting, but lack the multi-faceted quality that made books like ""Beloved"" and ""Song of Solomon"" so rich. There is merit to this book, I just didn't find that merit to be worth the effort of slogging through the murky depths of the convoluted storyline."
2,Trying to finish,"after two weeks of reading, re-reading, and starting over. There are so many characters that float in and out and back again, not to mention the oven. Perhaps if I could find the time to read thru the whole book, I might catch on. Not a book I would suggest."
2,Disappointed!!!,"I'm one of those avid Toni Morrison fans who has read and enjoyed all of her books, so you can imagine my disappointment when I finally struggled my way through ""Paradise"" and realised that I didn't get it! Can anyone PLEASE explain the ending? Maybe the intelligent 18 year old from Ontario could illuminate our ignorant brains. Honey, you'll grow out of calling other people stupid as soon as you hit my age. Wisdom is a gift bestowed upon a few lucky ones."
2,At least I can say I tried.....,"From the reviews posted here, Paradise seems to divide people into two seperate camps - those who gush & gush, and those who feel ripped-off. I fall into the latter category. I am truly sorry to say that, as I enjoyed Beloved immensely. I look for books to affect me emotionally & at the last page of Beloved, I was crying. However, reading Paradise felt like a chore. Like so many others, I forced myself to finish it. You can't imagine my relief on finally being able to put the damn book down! Out of pride I finished it, I wanted to be able to say,yes, I read it. Luckily, this didn't dissuade me of reading any other Toni Morrison novels. Immediately after reading Paradise, I read Song of Solomon, probably not wanting to leave such a bad taste in my mouth. Well, it worked and I think I'll pick up The Bluest Eye next."
1,Terrible waste of paper,"One of the supremely happy moments in my life came about page 100, when I said to myself: ""I don't have to read this book, even if it came from a Nobel prize winner, and even though I'm out 25 bucks."" Ms. Morrison may have deserved the Novel accolade for her body of work before she won the prize, but the money or fame or something has obviously created an impenetrable barrier between herself and good writing. She should give all the money back, including my $25."
1,Deeply Flawed,"This is another overwritten, emotional screed from the highly overrated hack. Paper thin charactors, empty headed plot, and stiff, cliche ridden prose. Ms. Morrison is nothing more than a product of a politically correct and deluded Nobel committee and Oprah hype. A pitiful effort and complete waste of a reader's time and money."
1,Disappointed,"I made a beeline for this book after Oprah's glowing review and was deeply disappointed. The first paragraph was a grabber, but it soon fizzled. The convoluted prose and disjointed characterizations did not entice me to dig deeper or leave me wanting more. By the end of the book I could have cared less who was killed or who did the killing. Ah well, I guess after having just read the literary masterpiece ""Cold Mountain"" anything else was bound to be a real let down."
4,Profound---Thought provoking---Troubling,"Man is not an island unto himself. If he chooses isolation, he risks diminishing himself mentally, physically and spiritually. Isolation shrouded the citizens of Ruby, as well as the women of the Convent. PARADISE lies within each of Morrison's characters, to choose or to reject."
4,Hard to follow but worth the read.,"In the beginning it was a difficult book to read in as the story jumped between past and future and back again. Once I made a conscious effort to retain the information, the story moved right along. In spite of this I thought it was very well written and I realized I really enjoyed sorting out the story in my mind. This is a book that really makes you think."
3,"Beautiful writing...but ""huh?""","I heard Ms. Morrison read a selection from Paradise when it was still a work in progress and I couldn't wait to see the rest of it. But, like her reading, the book was beautiful yet confusing. When I heard her read, I thought it was just lost on me because I hadn't heard the rest of the story. Now I know, I was lost because there just was not a lot of clarity here. This book is worth your while IF you don't have your hopes up that it will be the best thing you ever read...if you are expecting that, you might walk away disappointed."
4,Paradise,"This novel had it's moments, powerful moments, but alas, ""only moments"". I had heard a lot of praise for this novel but maybe I just missed the point. I know it's about the individuals in Ruby and the convent characters too, but it's being touted as this only happened in a small black town. I don't think so. It could have been anywhere, anybody USA. A small town with its own secrets."
1,Not good reading,"If a writer can't get me involved in their story in the first 100 pages, I don't finish it. I read half of this book and realized that I was forcing myself to pick it up because of Oprah. I didn't like it and will not read any of her selections again."
2,I read fiction for entertainment,"By the time I got half way through Paradise, I decided to stop wasting my precious time and return the book to the library so someone else could read it. I didn't love or hate any of the characters in the book. I was unable to feel anything for any of them. I'm sure Toni Morrison wrote the book to be dissected by students in literature class. Quite frankly, if I want to dissect a book, it better be nonfiction. I used to be the type of person who would have to finish a book once I started reading it. Paradise has cured me of that. Life is too short to waste."
4,The language soared and so did my spirit.,"I read the book before the hoopla and found it a rich reading experience- a full symphony, a multicourse meal. I had feelings not experienced since""Song of Myself' was asigned in lit class. I will now read it again for more layers of experience,and not for ""difficulty."""
2,Paradise,"This book had interesting moments. So far I have read three of Ms. Morrison's books including this one, ""The Bluest Eye,"" and ""Sula.""I was often bored reading this book. Her writing tends to be depressive and odd, yet informative of the black culture at times. Each of her books seems to contain some element of horrific incident(s) that will stir the emotions. I am hoping for more from ""Song of Solomon."" I can't help but wonder if Oprah would recommend books that portray the abuses whites have suffered at the hands of blacks. It has occurred, but since whites have never been considered abused by the slave days of old, these stories do exist, even in more modern times."
1,"I read for pleasure, and this book was truly awful.","I only bought this dog of a book because my mother saw it on Oprah and said how good it was supposed to be. This is my first (and probably only) Oprah selection that I will knowingly buy. If any future titles pique my interest, then I will wait for them at the public library.I don't read to try to decipher garbage, and to me that's what this stupid book was all about. I couldn't stand it and shipped it to my mom after reading up to page 37, wishing her the best of luck in figuring out what it was all about!!!"
2,Did I missunderstand?,"After reading this book I felt as if I was still waiting for something very big to happen.......It left me wondering whether I was the only one in the world to missunderstand this book. All in all, it left me feeling stupid and very upset that I did not ""get it"". It's been a month since I have read the book and I still think about it and wonder what I missed. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because I enjoyed the style of writing and it did manage to keep my interest up although I WAS expecting more from the ending. I felt very let down by this book."
2,Sad to Consider,"It is sad to consider the true literary greats never honored with a Nobel and then see a writer of such limited talent and intellect so rewarded. This novel is particularly pedestrian, obtuse, and lifeless. Very sad indeed."
2,Thoughts are not oraganized.,"Having read all of Toni Morrisson's books, this one by far is not her best novel. Her chapters do not flow from one thought to the next, they jump around and you(the reader) have to make the connection. No, I don't think this book is dificult to read, just difficult to follow because you have to work at putting it all together. It started out as a great idea, but somehow it got lost in the rambling of Ms. Morrisson."
2,can't we lose this paradise?,"Oh mercy, I wonder how many unfortunate book discussion groups are going to be slogging through this one. Paradise, by Toni Morrison, is convoluted, overwritten and downright confusing. She sets up a smug tone that grits the teeth. I have a mental picture of Oprah chomping happily on a burger, reading Jackie Collins, and snickering to herself at the thought of earnest readers toiling through Paradise. Thumbs down,"
3,Too Scattered to hold my attention,"After Oprah bragged about what a wonderful book this was, I had to read it. However, it is sitting on my bookshelf after only reading half of the book. It is hard to follow and unless you're re-reading every paragraph and page, it is hard to understand. This one would go over the average reader's head. I think even Oprah just ""pretended "" to ""get it"" to push Toni Moorison's work."
3,"After a long hard day, it only gets harder!","I find myself troubled by this book and how difficult it is to follow. I don't mind reading slowly, and, in fact, I have no objection to taking my time with anything, however, right now, this is simply trying my patience.I want to keep going because I've invested so much of myself into it, but, I find myself making excuses for not reading it.I wish Ms. Morrison had thought about the impact of making the reading so challenging and had eased up on us just a little bit.I am worn out from focusing on every word, but if I don't, then, from one sentence to the next, I lose site of a character, and then I'm lost too!I just hope I can hang on long enough to get to the finish line, where, I know I'll have to start all over again!After a long hard day, you really have to work hard with this one. Do yourself a favor, save it for a vacation, otherwise, the everyday stress of life, coupled with reading it, will simply wear you out!"
2,Some things do not improve with age!,"Paradise is anything but! I realize that I should probably read the novel one or two more times before I pass judgment, but the thought of having to wade through all those characters and themes, again is agonizing, at present. Of course, I said something similar of Beloved upon its initial publication and over time, came to love, admire and appreciate it as it deserves to be appreciated. Unfortunately, I don't see the same happening with Paradise ... but I'll give it another try when it comes out in paperback."
1,"Not a success. Book sinks under its own weight, doesn't mov","Morrison's obvious fluency does not serve her well in this novel. Paradise is a quagmire that sucks into itself all that could make it rock: movement, action, a forward-going narration, dramatic tension, tight plotting. Morrison seems to have been too much in love with the book's ""epic"" format and her own ability to write expressive, descriptive prose to pay attention to the above requirements. Paradise is full of ideas and themes; unfortunately it quickly becomes an inert mass that eludes our desire to give it our full concentration and praise. Is it perhaps several novels mistakenly entwined in one binding? A huge effort, not a success."
1,1 Star is 1 too many!,"I read this book because Oprah Winfrey recommended it in her book club. After 2 days of trudging through it, I was hellbent on finishing it, just for principle! Secretly I was hoping it would get better...but it never did. The most interesting and (I think) valuable aspect of the book was how it described the members of the small black community's prejudices against others of their town, and how the color of their skin determined their worth in the community. However, I never did figure out how the convent fit into the picture. The words were descriptive and eloquent, but the story was lost on me."
3,"Morrison proves herself, once again.","Toni Morrison has always been one of my favorite authors. Last winter, I received Paradise as a gift, and I couldn't wait to begin reading it. However, once I did, although I felt like I was reading it all the time, it took me seven months to finish it. There are hundreds of characters, jumbled together, and at times, I found it hard to stay interested. However, Morrison's talent is evident with every word and I enjoyed reading it. Some sentences she writes surprise me so, I have to write them down and ponder them! It isn't comparable with Beloved or the Bluest Eye, but its themes were excellent. I absorbed the female characters' strengths and found I learned from their mistakes. Their experiences became my experiences. I would def. reccommend reading this one."
2,From one who muddled through it.,"After I finished this book I felt angry at Morrison for being so obtuse. I kept asking myself ""why?"" What did it prove that she had to make the book so hard to understand and unravel? I felt like she was playing some kind of literary joke on her readers or else trying to make herself look smart and the average reader look dumb.I feel like there was important meaning in the book, but unless you take a literature class that focuses on this book, most will not likely ever get it -- and to me, that is the waste of a book that so many will read and could be elevated by.Toni Morrison, you are too good a writer to waste your time making your book so hard to understand for so many people. I found myself asking, what was your point?"
1,"Just didn't get it, and I'm upset about that.","Disappointed? I am. I really am a fan of Morrison's work--for many, many years, but I thought there was too much going on with too many characters, and the story gets lost, hidden, whatever. When I invest time in a book, I should be able to understand the ending, that shouldn't be a priveledge because I've taken notes during the reading. The plot format and structure was really interesting, but somehow, some way, it sadly didn't work."
1,Sophomoric,"I tried and failed again. I cannot get through Ms. Morrison's books without frustrating effort, and sometimes not at all. Her writing is sophomoric and lacks the finesse of a truly gifted author. She owes a huge debt of gratitude to Oprah for her support. Paradise, like Jazz, was a waste of money and time."
1,Don't bother with this one.,Toni Morrison has too many characters in this book. It reads like the family tree for this whole Oklahoma town. Toni Morrison has been slowly going down hill from her first book. She just gives too much detail of stuff that has no relevance. Stick to the facts. I will never buy one of her books again. What a waste!!!!
1,Trouble In Paradise,"This is one of the most muddled books I've ever plodded through. I am the only person I know who read this book from cover to cover, hoping to find some justification for its stellar reviews. I could find none."
1,Morrison's weaknesses overwhelm her,"Ever since Sula, Morrison has been developing a penchant for mythic characters and situations, a prose style which is more oratory than specific, and situations and events which are neither realistic nor magical but a way to avoid dealing with real life. All of these flaws are brought together, exponentially, in this text. The faults are too many to go into great depth: the narrative is too fractured; too much ""poetry"" (poetry, Toni, is concrete and minimal, not flowery); one-dimensional characters. But the worst flaw is how Morrison dodges saying anything critical about black people or women, and instead, after a brutal execution, everyone is forgiven and lives on in paradise. Toni, this response to the world is too easy."
2,Please give me more Ms. Morrison,"Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment."
1,Maybe it's Poop.,"Maybe I'm immature, maybe I am not intelligent enough, or lack the patience it takes to understand Paradise,or maybe it's poop.I"
2,Time and Patience Required,"As a freshman in High School, William Faulkner was required reading. This books brings back memories of Faulkner none of them good. I keep reading hoping to get to the point... As a fan of her earlier writings and knowing that she is one of the greatest authors of our time, I trust there was a point somewhere...but I missed it. I felt as if I was reading for required academic purposes. I found no joy in the process. I needed an index to recall the various characters. I would argue that in order to understand and enjoy this book, you need at least a week to dedicate solely to reading this book."
2,I wonder about those critics,"A dud. I've read Morrison's earlier novels. They were good. Perhaps the Nobel and Pulitzer went to her head. And I wonder about literary critics who seem to praise novels simply because they are written by ""established"" writers. A tangled plotline doesn't always make for a good story. Skip this one. It ain't worth your time."
2,Not Impressed !,"I've read all of T. Morrison's books, many more than once and all for pleasure. Generally, I've been pleased and felt rewarded by these experiences. However, Paradise was a major disappointment. Given the warnings that the book was complex, I actually read each page, highlighted key passages and kept notes on each character. This did not help prepare me for the final chapter. I am left feeling ""all dressed-up with no place to go!"". This is not one that I would recommend for pleasure. No, I will not re-read. That should not be necessary for a pleasure-based text. Advice: Wait for the paperback version........"
1,this is a bad book,"I couldn't even get half way through this bookwhen I was reading it I felt completely. confused so i finally got so frusterated andmailed the book back to the publisher.I have no intentions of buying one of ToniMorrisons books again. On Oprah's Book Clubthey kepts refering to going back and readingthe book several times. Any book that the 1stchapter and the book has to be re-read severaltimes isn't worth my time. I sure hope Oprahdoesn't pick her books again, cause I won't bereading them."
2,Disappointing! Tired from all those complex subplots.,"Toni Morrison is such a talented and articulate writer, I was expecting much more than this turned out to be. It was exhausting trying to keep up with all those complex and troubled individuals. This was a disappointing and frustrating reading experience."
2,Can the Nobel Prize be withdrawn?,"I was assigned ""Paradise"" for a class at Colgate University. I wonder now if the professor had read the book prior to putting it on the sylabus. Who can follow a story that has no sort of time while following characters that necessarily lack development, just by the sheer number included? The reader cannot care what happens to the citizens of Ruby. The only reason I give it a three is because of the rich use of language. However, it is not strong enough to overcome the multitude of faults. I have lost all faith in Oprah. I read for pleasure, and in this work I found none."
2,Paradise Lost,"I was disappointed with this book, as was everyone else in my reading group. I do not feel she adequately concluded all the threads running through the story."
2,The NY Times was divided on this book.,"There is a subtle snobbbishness in much of the praise of this novel. It is difficult, we are told, but everything worthwhile is. (Subtext if you don't like this book maybe you aren't up to reading it.) Toni Morrison's book is difficult, but that hardly seems the point. The question is ""Is it worth the effort?"" I have been slogging through this book in hopes that the answer is yes but in the end the answer is no. In an effort to understand what it is I was missing I checked out the NY Times website and looked for the review of Paradise. Low and behold I discovered that the NY Times had printed more than one review of this book. A favorable review (quoted above) was in the Sunday Times but a very unfavorable one was printed in the daily paper!"
2,This book stumbles over its own words.,"The story is so imbedded in unnecessary literary gymnastics that I found this book unenjoyable. The women in the convent were not likeable and the town's people were difficult to follow without a family tree. I felt no empathy for any of the characters. There were so many of them that they all appreared shallow. This is the first Toni Morrison book I have read, and I do hope this was not her best as it would be difficult to see how she could be a prize winning novelist at this rate. It takes so long to find the story that it seems to have lost any plot before it even begins. The premise of the book is fine - it is the style in which it is written that seems most flawed."
3,An interesting story pretentiously & obliquely told,"I liked the story idea, and was eager to know how it would all come about. Ms. Morrison apparently doesn't want that to happen. Time-shifting isn't so bad (I loved ""Pulp Fiction"" & ""Seinfeld Backwards""), but other rapid shifts between characters, places, conversations and thoughts without guideposts seem to be purposefully misdirecting. It's interesting that many readers feel rewarded by repeated readings. I believe that rereading would be frustrating: more of the same. Those noting the similarity to reading Shakespeare seem right on. I think there's some feigned intellectualism in the writing and reviewing of this wordy, murky book. - Harry Wareham, Monterey, CA"
4,A Struggle,"The writing is eloquent, the structure is distracting. I read *Beloved* years ago and found it soul-touching. I found *Paradise* too scattered to feel touched by it. I will reread the book and hope for more, but I resent the need to read it multiple times to ""get it"". Reading *Paradise* I sense that Ms. Morrison has a plethora of deeply emotional issues within her and she seeks an avenue to express them. I would love to meet her and have her lend voice to the characters. Perhaps I should have just ""read"" the audiotape."
1,One big puzzlement,"The story is one big puzzle, full of flashbacks that are intertwined and developed, leading to even more puzzlement. I never got all the characters straight, even the major ones. I found it almost impossible to follow the story line. And I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages. However, I plodded on. After all, wasn't this book recommended by Oprah? Didn't this book get rave reviews? Isn't Toni Morrison a Pulitzer Prize winner and a professor at Princeton?It's 318 long long pages and I had to push myself to read it. Halfway through the book I almost put it down. Why was I still getting the characters mixed up. Why wasn't I moved by some of their stories? I hoped it would get better after I passed the half-way mark. It didn't.The tone is heavy and depressing. The characters each have deep dark ugly secrets. There is rarely any relief from the long artistic, somewhat poetic sentences. I didn't understand the ending, but at least it was over."
2,Flashback Kingdom,A very hard book to follow. I had to push myself through to finish this book. The flashbacks were hard to follow. This book is not a relaxing read. Be prepared for much work when reading this book.
1,BAD READING,"My conclusion my be unwarranted because I did not finish the book. I could not finish the book, I tried very had, I read it half way through twice then I read a little further and I just couldn't continue. This was the worst peice of literature that I have ever attempted to read. I can not believe that this book was rated #1. Maybe It's just me I thougt until I discussed the book with the few people that I know who were able to finish the book. I am glad that I did not buy the book, it was difinitly beyond me. I will probably never read another one of Toni Morrison's book."
1,I was disappointed. I couldn't even finish it.,"I was relieved to read all the other reviews on this book. Like many others that have read or attempted to read this book - it was just too complex to follow. I read for pleasure and this was just too much work. I hate not finishing a book, but I only made it half way through this one."
1,I must lack perseverance,The first of the book naturally caught my attention. I labored intensely through too long chapters for somewhat more than half the book. The characters were complex and moreso their relationship to each other. I found no thread to place any continuity on what I was reading. It was a waste and I gave it one star because there no options for less than one.
2,Pretentious and disappointing,"I don't like books that are so pretentious that they make me feel stupid.I got about fifty pages into this book, realized that I still had no idea what the hell was going on, and returned it to the library.To the author: why don't you try writing a book for real people, instead of the academics? That's what all real art is about: to create something that resonates with the common man, not just with an exclusive set of art-minded elitists."
4,Digitech DDM Death Metal,"This pedal is good if your amp doesn't offer much distortion. For me, I my Crate Gfx 15 offers alot more punch than this pedal. Only reason I rated it a 4 is because all of the knobs go to 11."
3,Ordered this for my cousin,"I ordered this pedal for my cousin. He has a cheap starter guitar and amp but no kind of distortion or effects. This pedal didn't really sound too good on his cheap amp. If you're planning on buying this pedal, it's my advice to just get a better amp and a footswitch for it. I have a Spider IV 75 and a footswitch. The built in effects on the amp have all the sound I want. Chorus, flanger, reverb, etc etc and there's no need for lots of pedals.But as for the pedal, well, it works. Would sound better if he had a better amp tho."
3,The Grunge is Better,"This pedal has it's place in metal, but I wouldn't use it for death metal, the Grunge, which I own, has a much more metal character that I would push tubes with. This pedal is decent but very thrashy in sound quality, shop around before you buy. Try other pedals at a local retailer, and bring your amp in to hear what you would REALLY sound like, then, make a decision, and come back."
1,Poor quality for pure essential oil,"I saw this oil on Amazon website, but ordered directly from the supplier, Auroma. Tried it in a cold process soap. It has a very weak fragrance, even when used directly in a massage oil. Now Foods grapefruit oil is much cheaper and way better quality. You can also try the Eden's brand on AmazonWaste of money. Seek another brand. Also, when contacted, their customer service is very slow to respond, or do not respnond at all."
5,Childhood Favorite Instills Entrepreneurial Spirit,"In the late 70's my father was a professor of economics at the University of South Dakota. This was one of the few books from my childhood that I remember vividly, although I'm not sure why since it has no dragons or stories about girls living on prairies.I am almost 40 now and I'm ordering this book for my nieces and nephews. I suspect it might be responsible for planting an entrepreneurial seed in my sub-conscious since today I daydream frequently about selling coconuts on a tropical island !"
5,Works Great!!,"Great software at a great price! It is as functional as Cakewalk Pro Audio 7 was (I used to use that). The 64 audio track limit is not a problem, I have never even got close to that many audio tracks. There are a lot of free MIDI effects and VST effects and instruments available for free online if you need anything this program doesn't offer....If you can't get sound look under OPTIONS->AUDIO->ADVANCED and try a different driver (ASIO, MME, etc...). ASIO is best (update soundcard drivers or look for ASIO4ALL). Also don't forget to pick MIDI devices (OPTIONS->MIDI DEVICES) or you'll get no MIDI playback either....."
3,Garage Band for PC?,"So far, I haven't been able to fully use the program. The manual that comes with it is helpful, but it seems like such a waste of time to read. Half of the information in it is obvious and the other half is technical terms and acronyms that I don't understand.Right away I was able to record and is sounds good. I just can't edit very much yet. I think I will be able to eventually."
4,A gift for my husband,I bought this to replace my husbands old cakewalk program for windows 95...From what I know of the program and from what my husband and son ( both of which are musicians) its a great home version and has all the bells and whisles you can need. My husband is still working on tweeking it to suit him but thats a plus ... the abilty to tweek it to your needs.
1,"! Star because ""0"" is unavailable","Cakewalk will not give you a refund if their software is faulty or does not work correctly. They will ignore consumer inquiries and will not give any assistance other than to tell you the basics, rather than admitting there's a problem with the software. I've NEVER seen anything like it as long as I've been doing music. You'd be much better off going with a Sony product, as they actually stand by their stuff."
3,Trying too much,"In this third part of Fear of Flying book, main character Izadora Wing is not the narrator, narrator is Erica. Since the frist two books were writen in a diary like manner, I don't see any reason why third book isn't consistent. Besides, it seems that Erica in this book is trying to hard to be even more provocative than in first two books, to the limit that it's becoming tiresome. Some sexual scenes and descriptions of sexual acts just don't have any reason to be in the book but to make it more provocative. I also think that story is too dragged, too many details and many too much personal parts which are not interesting for average reader.A bit disappointing..."
4,LOOKS good.,"We are happy with the look of the mail box. It is not as ""sturdy"" as we had hoped. We'll see how it ""weathers"". Have only had it about 3 weeks."
5,No more questions about how meditation brings us forward...,This book helps us Western people to focus on the important things while meditating. In a very clear and easy speach it explains us step by step how we get a clear view beyond all our daily activities through to what really makes our life as human beings so very precious. I can recommend this book to anyone trying to approach meditation or trying to get further into meditating on a regular basis.
5,Life changing,"If your looking for a book to start a meditation regimine with this is it. This book gives you 21 meditations to follow, with brief discussions on what the meditation is about. This book is very good at getting the reader modivated to meditate. Details on how to perform breathing meditation, which is what the reader is asked to start with before going into the main meditation, is not included. However, these can be easily found on the internet. This book helped me become a more diciplined, effective and powerful meditator. It also lead me to the profound life changing realization of the power of compassion. Well worth the money."
5,Very good short introduction by a credible author,"This is a very short introduction to Tibetan Buddhist meditation by a very credible author. This is complicated territory and this book illuminates the path, especially for Westerners."
3,A bit of a rehash.......,"This is my second book by this gentleman, and although I mean no disrespect, I'ts almost a complete rehash of the first intro to Buddhism. It's practically a verbatim copy of the first and I feel a bit ripped off."
3,This is not a meditation exercize cd,The CD's contain a summery of budhist phylosophy of different aspects of life. There are no guided meditations on the CD.
5,With parables that clear the mind,"Ably written by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso (a meditation master and Tibetan-born teacher of Buddhism), The New Meditation Handbook offers a Buddhist perspective in both general words of wisdom concerning the benefits and practice of meditation, and twenty-one individual meditations for broadening the depth of one's thought and mind. An insightful volume with parables that clear the mind and assist one in expanding consciousness and understanding, The New Meditation Handbook is also available in a hardcover edition...."
2,Uninspiring,I found this text to be convoluted in its content. The author imposes tiers of meditation awareness which I found off putting
4,An adequate guide for the new meditator,"This book divides the LamRim into 21 analytical meditations, which the reader is to progress through one at a time, in a series, and then start again at the beginning. It provides an adequate introduction to its subject."
1,empty and useless,"The people buying this book think its a meditation book. Boy did they get fooled. Most of the book is about paranormal concepts like ""spiritual guides"" and ""karma"" and praying. That is fine and dandy, but the author should not pretend the book is about meditation. If your looking for superstitious concepts from Buddhism you will like the book. If your looking for meditation you will be gravely dissapointed. He covers only one meditation the whole book and barely even explains it."
5,Another amazing manga!,"I picked this up just two days ago, thinking it might be good. I have read the series Yu Yu Hakusho (at least what's published of it so far), and loved it. This series is by the same man. If you liked Yu Yu Hakusho, you're bound to like this too.There are a few main things that differ between the two. First of all, Hunter X Hunter seems to be more of an adventure manga, rather than the fighting manga that Yu Yu Hakusho turned out to be. The drawings in Hunter X Hunter are great, but are, for the most part, not as detailed as in Yu Yu Hakusho. Finally, Hunter X Hunter plays more around a few characters rather than just focusing on one, as in Yu Yu Hakusho.So if you like adventure, danger, excitement, then Hunter X Hunter is definitely for you! I highly recommend it!"
3,A hunting I will go...,"Hunters are greedy, honorable, highly skilled people who collect, steal, protect, and hunt down valuable animals and relics. The story is about a boy, Gon, whose father was a Hunter and he wants to be a Hunter too. The art work is kind of lame, the character design could be better, and the story itself is kind of slow. But the characters, their merits and flaws, are solid and the setting seems fantastic enough to be interesting. Kind of reminds me, slightly, of One Piece, but not as good."
5,A fine read,"The authors approach groups, both large and small, contexually. The subject matter is handled in a rich and thoughtful way. This book is not just for mental health practitioners but anyone interested in post-structuralist thought."
4,The New Freedon of Forgiveness,An honest and thoughtful book. It is a book about relationships and the difficulty of differences and injury that crop up within these relationships. A biblical foundation of forgiveness and paths toward restoration. A great read to come back to time and again.
4,good,"good book, glad i bought it, David does a nice job of showing and applying forgiveness and how it is effective."
4,Hard to read because..,Of the pain involved in it. This is a good tool to have and read and use and give away to freinds. It is gentel but direct and makes you really think about your problems.
1,bare minimum,"While it is calendar pages, this product was very dissapointing as that's all it is, a few sheets of loose paper with dates printed on it. Not even a cheap pad behind it and not even bound together. If I had known, I would have just used the calendar that came with the desk pad I had to buy to hold these pages together. It was better quality."
3,Not her best,"I would suggest that you read this only after reading The Strangeness of Beauty, which is a wonderfully written novel."
1,"Awful, Just Awful","I really wanted to like this book. I have been schooled in the wisdom of ""original blessing"" as a corrective for the concept of original sin, and well, I'm a woman. So I thought this book would be right up my alley. Reilly goes overboard, however, in rejecting _any_ attempts at self-discernment as negative. There is such a thing as self-assessment that is accepting, positive, and life-affirming, without necessarily approving of everything that we accept about ourselves.In the end, by overlooking the necessary distinction between ""acceptance"" and ""approval,"" the book limits the possibilities for growth that it can nurture. And that's a shame. It is, ultimately, patronizing to believe that women are too fragile to handle self-critique. We can be our own best critics, but this book won't help.Conclusion: stand by with the insulin shots while reading this one."
2,Not what I expected,This more like a book of poems or short thoughts. You can pick it up and read a page here and there but I couldn't sit down and read it all at once.
1,don't know,"I was not able to receive this book as it was out of stock but the seller is great and I purchased a different book and will purchase in the future, more books from this seller"
1,"Blue Ray, huh, looks like a vhs copy of the film was used to make this version","I bought this movie cause it is one of my favorite films starring Liza Minnelli. the packaging is very nice but the movie is the problem. I movie appears grainy, all the way through...this is the 2nd movie that I have bought on blu Ray that has this grainy appearance, the other was Pillow Talk, I will think twice about buying blu ray movies of films over 10 years old because the quality is not much better than regular dvd's. Do not buy this, cause it is a huge disappointment."
5,"TIRED OF WAITING, BUT I'LL WAIT NONETHELESS","I'll make it short: one of the top films of the 70s; one of the most disappointing DVDs of the 2000s. But I can't bring myself to rant; WB came to the rescue on ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, DELIVERANCE, NETWORK, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON, to mention a few. Until they rescue CABARET from a similarly shoddy series of editions, I'll wait before giving them my money for this one. But I have faith. C'mon, 'Bros.!"
2,Cabaret,"The 2003 DVD re-release of Cabaret is just a re-packaging of the original DVD. Though the new package details state that it is ""enhanced for 16 x 9,"" this DVD is a non-anamorphic, matted widescreen presentation. So if you were thinking of trading up to this new edition of Cabaret for your new widescreen TV, hold on to your money. I was not so fortunate. I now have two copies of Cabaret with lousy transfers. Whats up with Warner? They screwed up the release of Giant also. This film is a classic and deserves better treatment."
1,Life NOT such a Cabaret,"I too had great expectation of this reissue and the main reason I purchased it was for the stated anamorphic enhancement which it definitely is not. With all the interest in Kander & Ebb at the moment, this was a perfect opportunity to revamp a truely classic movie and address the poor transfer of the original issue. Warner are clearly just jumping on the promotional bandwagon with little concern for the value of the movie itself. This is Liza's finest moment and a critic's dream of cinematic metaphor and construction- it deserves better than this. It saddens me to think that it is unlikely to be issued again- the best Warner can do is recall this rerelease and do the job properly. I now own three versions on DVD- the region 2 uk release is even more washed out than the USA issue!"
1,great movie -- awful quality of dvd,"This is a great movie. Love it, so I ordered this dvd to watch on my new high def 50"" tv. Terrible quality! very disappointing"
5,THE BEST,"As for musical-drama concerned... THIS IS IT! The producers of Chicago should have seen this(indeed they did - every major moment in that film is ""stolen"" from Cabaret) and put REAL musical stars in the film.When u have Joel and Liza u are not let down... I give flowergreetings to the entire cast and crew... The filmversion of Cabaret has a lot of ""new songs""(Maybe This Time, Mein Herr, The Money Song) and the plot follows the 1955-movie ""I AM A CAMERA"" more than the stage musical. Since then; the Liza-songs have found themselves in numerous revivals of this stageplay since this 1972-masterpiece. The film is still frightening and raw......Trivia: The scene in which Liza meets Marisa they talk about diseases... On video, here in Europe at least, that was cut...."
3,CABARET,I've bought the DVD CABARET from you and it seems like it's not an original. It's dark and can't be seeing properly
4,If only for the music!,"Ya know, you just want to like this film if only for the music, plus I think its filmed beautifully. It also makes for a ""more fun"" period piece with giddy Ms. Minnelli as the star."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Cabaret is a musical for people who don't like them--none of the songs stain the viewer's disbelief (as they all occur in natural settings for songs), the historical context is very interesting, and the acting (particularly by Joel Grey) is great; the movie suffers a bit because the Cabaret scenes are much more interesting than the central romance, but it's a very good movie nonetheless."
2,GREAT MOVIE HORRIBLE SOUND,"This is a classic musical, but my goodness the sound will rupture your eardrums. My god, warner brothers, show your classics some respect. Did they TRY to make it sound this bad? Like fingernails on a chalk board. It's painfully distracting from the film experience. You have to turn up the volume to distinguish the dialogue, and when you do, it sounds ancient. Hissing and noisy. Ugh! And this is the collector's edition?! The film (as in many cases i am finding lately) is worth much more than the DVD treatment it gets."
5,Great blu ray transfer of a film classic,"I saw the film in its original theatrical release and can safely say this blu ray transfer is the best the film has looked ever. You can visually appreciate what Bob Fosse was going for with the multi layered story line accompanied by the ironic greek chorus musical numbers. Of course Liza's musical numbers are great but there is a lot more going on in this film than is superficially apparent or even as compared to the Broadway show itself. The cinematography is great and you feel transported into the seedy Kit Kat Club and Berlin of the early 30's.The audio portion of the bluray was good, clear but perhaps not as resonant as one would have liked but that is quibbling and perhaps unavoidable given the age of the film source. I highly recommend this blu ray for any lover of the show, film or musicals in general. You will not be disappointed."
3,It was ok,"Not a bestseller in my opinion but, It was sort of interesting to watch, though I would not be recommending it to someone I know."
1,Completely Unimpressive,I've never seen the show live or heard any other recordings so I can't say if it's Cabaret it'sself or just this movie that's bad. I found this film to be so boring and the music so annoying that I turned it off after 40 minutes. If you're a fan of Cabaret then you might like this (I really wouldn't know) but all in all this is a really tiresome film with only a few worthwhile moments
2,Cabaret,".... ONE GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL FILM!!... and, one that has stood the test of time for almost 30 years now, just to have modern technology ""BLOW"" the sountrack, what a shame. I feel particularly sorry for those who might have sold their laserdisc version anticipating this DVD. The Widescreen Magazine review of the sound track is kind."
4,Liza rocks,I really enjoyed her mothers singing and acting so it's no surprise I enjoy her's also. But then again I enjoy most musical movies.
4,A classic Liza Minnelli in a stylized unforgetable performance,"Liza Minnelli at her peak in a performance that showcases her acting, singing while surrounded by an excellent cast. It is not your typical musical that you can sit down with family and watch, but still bound to be a classic. Good direction and strong performances that are visually enhanced by costumes, scenery and a great music score."
5,A Message from Mr. Movie Buff,"Cabaret is if not THE best musical, but certainly one of the best musicals ever made. The story takes place during World War II in Nazi Germany. Liza Minelli plays Sally Bowles, an American who performs at a local Kit Kat Klub, and who has an English professor staying with her who is a bisexual. The movie mostly focuses on their relationship and Sally's life outside and inside the club. Cabaret was an excellent musical and not just because of the music in it, but because of the story and of the history it takes place during. It does have some excellent musical numbers in it, including The Money Song, and the title song. A must watch for everyone!"
2,Beware the Warner Brothers Rip-Off,"Cabaret is one of the great movie musicals of all time. Unfortunately this DVD version, released in 2003 is misrepresented as a Widescreen format enhanced for Widescreen televisions. It is not. The Widescreen picture is ""matted"" and fills only a portion of the screen on newer HD sets. Since there is no other version available, if you love the movie this is the only way to own it. Shame on Warner Brothers for not releasing a classic like this with a pristine print that does the film justice."
1,BEWARE FALSE ADVERTISING,"This edition is exactly the same one that was put out a few years ago with the original film poster logo on the front. The only difference with this DVD, supposedly, is that it was enhcanced for WIDESCREEN tv, as it states on the rear cover. Seems they haven't done a thing with the aspect ration for wide screen. It just stretches out the picture and gives Liza a lot more weight in her performance. Warner Bros. DVD should check their words more carefully if they're going to re-issue something and not make any changes. Otherwise, the film looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, even the orchestra is beautiful....."
2,Lousy Picture Quality,Whoever is responsible for the video quality of this DVD should be ashamed. A great movie is ruined because of the graininess of the picture. I sold my copy and am waiting for someone to wake up and give us what this movie deserves.
2,"5-star movie, 0-star DVD transfer","What a huge disappointment this 2003 DVD reissue is. It's in non-anamorphic widescreen, which basically means that the letterbox bars are part of the image signal. HDTV owners with 16:9 sets will be most affected, but anyone who plan on upgrading to HDTV anytime in the future should avoid making this DVD a part of their permanent library. People with newer-model, higher-end standard definition TV's will also be negatively impacted. Why did Warners go to all the trouble of reissuing this classic without doing a better job?The film itself is one of the finest musicals ever made. If you're a fan, consider renting to get your Cabaret fix. If you feel you must buy it, plan on selling this edition at a future garage sale when the next reissue comes out."
1,Shame on you Warner Brothers,"The same cover from 2004, but hidden by a new sleeve. Released again in 2008. On the the cover the claim, ""enhanced for widescreen TVs"". Shame on you Warner Brothers. You've repackaged the old release which was not (and is not) enhanced for widescreen TVs. Now I have two copies with black bars on all four sides. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... It won't happen again, until the word hits the streets that a Warner Brothers Release is truly anamorphic, I won't buy. Bad business move. Very Bad."
5,It was a fine affair but now it's over...,"I saw Cabaret after seeing the recent film version of Chicago, and though I expected another lavish Fosse fantasy, what I saw was a very different film altogether. Chicago is a glamorous, glorified portrait of decadence without consequence, but Cabaret reveals the garish, disappointing underside of it all. The girls, the costumes, even the orchestra is not exactly beautiful. But they are honest. This divine decadence is literally all smoke and mirrors, it is all gaudy makeup over a dirty and desperate Germany in 1931.While I'm not a huge fan of Liza Minnelli, she is perfect as wild child Sally Bowles. Michael York is equally wonderful as the innocent and effeminate Brian Roberts. I kind of wished that the film explored the ambiguous sexuality of the characters more than it did, but given the time the film was released, it is remarkable that the film has the frankness that it does."
5,A product of an era - and a great one.,"An admirable, and incredibly hard hitting view of nazi Germany wrapped in a glossy layer of songs, spangles and slapstick. This was a breakthrough in so many ways - acknowledging the Holocaust, the horror for the everyday people of Germany, using satire and music to bring home a chilling message about the disintegration of social values. Then we also deal with homosexuality, drug use, abortion and many other 'tabu' subjects These were things Hollywood wasn't too keen to explore, so TEN stars for the groundbreaking this film achieved.That said, I would encourage anyone to get to a live production. See the show as it was originally written (the film adaptation makes a completely different story really). It is a far more compelling, funny and then heart breaking experience. And not one that COULD be captured on film.Two faces, same coin..."
3,"Great Musical Numbers, Nothing Else","The songs and musical numbers are brilliant, among the very finest ever put on film. Unfortunately, the movie has nothing to say. The filmmakers want me to see some connection between the alleged ""decadence"" and the rise of the Nazis. Is there one? What do the Nazis have to do with the game of musical beds that makes up the plot? The answer: Not much. But Nazis are a potent visual symbol, and they add SIGNIFICANCE to any artistic endeavor. Just add Nazis, and suddenly your work has MEANING, right? Not quite. There is more going on here than that. When you think about it, the film has a remarkably prissy attitude towards sex. All of the so-called decadence of the film centers around the fact that characters actually (gasp!) sleep with each other. And we are intended to see this decadence as having something to do with Nazism, so are Fosse & Co. saying that sex = Nazism? I sincerely hope not."
5,A must-have DVD.,"I don't much care for the story but I love the music. Liza is the original ""Liza"". She is great in a part that she totally devours. Fortunately for all of us with a DVD we can skip over the rather tasteless parts."
3,Here to entertain.,"Carbaret starring Liza Minnelli in her Oscar-winning performance is a fun but superficial musical. The songs and dance numbers are of course brilliant thanks to Bob Fosse's genius, he also directed this film. I just couldn't get into the story and romance quality of this film. Just watch it if you're a die-hard Minnelli fan."
3,Okay buy,I had to watch this movie for a American Musical Theater Class. It was okay but definitely not one of the better ones I've seen
1,"Movie was great, method of delivery not so much",The resolution was not very good and the picture only took up a small fraction of the screen. I would have used Netflix if it was available on its site.
2,Why no Blu-Ray version of Cabret after 40 years??,"This is one of the most awesome films of all time. Winning critical praise and 8 Oscars to boot. It is the ultimate ""musicalwith a message."" Yet still no truly restored Blu-ray version of this important film is available and I wonder why? From the reviews I've read here for years now the DVD versions of Cabaret that are available are a real let down for consumers and fans of the film. Comments range from ""terrible quality"" to ""not worth"" buying. Does anyone know why the Warner Bros. studio refuses to release this film in a format it so richly deserves? I'm giving 2 stars because I don't like the fact that no Blu-ray of Cabaret is available after more than 40 years."
3,PG Decadence,"I have mixed emotions about ""Cabaret"". The songs by Kander and Ebb are great. The routines choreographed by Bob Fosse are mesmerizing. Joel Grey is wonderfully energetic as the Emcee. As great as he is, though, I don't know how he received the Oscar over Al Pacino for ""The Godfather"". Unfortunately, once the film leaves the Kit Kat Club it's a whole other story. The story is pure mawkish soap opera. I feel bad for an actor of Michael York's calibre having to slog through this drivel. Liza Minelli is a different story altogether. Sally Bowles is not a particularly compelling character and Minelli lacks the skills to make this character compelling. Should I also state that she isn't even that great a singer? How did she ever win the Oscar? While we're at it how did Fosse ever beat Francis Ford Coppola for the Oscar in direction? Fosse was a good director(see ""Lenny""), but come on."
5,Hazah!,"This movie is great--not just music wise, but for its great plot and its morose sybolism. One of my alltime favorites, and yours too."
1,Beware! Not HD/Blu-ray!,"This rating applies only to the supposedly ""new"" HD/Blu-ray release and not a review of the movie itself.Contrary to the product/packaging claims, this DVD is NOT HD/Blu-ray! If anything, it is simply average SD, including the audio. There are some interesting extras, but not worth buying due to the false/misleading claims."
5,Great,Received the DVD way ahead of schedule in perfect condition. Never been disappointed with Amazon!!
5,Exquisite,It is definitively a piece of art Liza looks radiant in the character of Sally Bowles and Joel Gray's interpretation is magnificentThe feature are very interesting it is an excellent art investment.
1,BAD DVD!!!!!!!!,Back cover states the DVD is Enhanced for Widescreen TVs etc and it is NOT 16:9 enhanced Warner Bros home Video will not even comment on this mistake. So NOW I OWN TWO copies of the same exact DVD different artwork is all. WARNER BROS should offer refunds!
3,"Film and History, or the other way around...","This film is possibly the best musical i have seen. The film is almost the antithesis of the pathetic no-brainer musicals of the 1950s and60s. This was not a choice viewing, but one for a uni course so i didn't watch it because i wanted to!! But I was surprised at the quality of the actors involved and the overall directing of the film. All of the issues dealt with were done with sensitivity, such as the homosexuality, the Nazi opposition to the Jewish population and the identity changing of some people to hide their family and past. The direction of the film by Fosse is brilliant and the work done on interweaving the Nazi uprising with the Caberet performances done by Sally Bowles and the MC are superb. If I were to pick out a scene that captivated me it would have to be when the young boy is singing and it scrolls down to reveal the Nazi uniform... chilling. I now understand why this movie is a cult."
4,Entertaining....,"This is a fun DVD to watch. It is fun to hear the music, watch the Fosse dances, and hear the lines. I didn't love it all that much, but it was pretty good!Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey were my favorite performers. I am glad they both won an Acadmy Awards.If you liked CABARET I also think you will like:CHICAGOALL THAT JAZZSWEET CHARITY"
5,Sweet glasses.,"As a chemist, I really like these glasses. They are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them (which has granted some weird looks on the street). They are an excellent, inexpensive addition to anyone's wardrobe. Plus, all the cool colors add some spice to any dreary lab."
4,"IF YOU LIKE CLASSIC SPACE OPERA, A GREAT READ.","I HAVE READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE HELMSMAN SERIES AND FOUND THE DEFENDERS TO BE AS FINE A READ AS THE PRECEEDING BOOKS. THIS IS NOT ""HARD"" SCIENCE FICTION, BUT A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CLASSIC ""SPACE OPERA"". THIS BOOK IS FUN TO READ! THE ONLY SAD THING ABOUT THIS OR OTHER BALDWIN BOOKS IS THAT FOR WHAT EVER REASON YOU CAN ALMOST NEVER FIND THEM IN YOUR LOCAL BOOKSTORE. IF YOU ARE NEW TO SCIENCE FICTION OR JUST LIKE A GOOD STORY WITH GOOD PLOT GIVE THE DEFENDERS A TRY"
2,"POOR, POOR, POOR","I waited to start this series until I had the first 7 books. I thought I had something after reading the first one. Not so. Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."
5,A Classic,"When I first started belly dancing when I was 13 (more years in the past than I care to admit to), this was the music my teacher used in class. While I love this CD for the nostalgia, it is also a timeless classic with beautiful traditional Middle Eastern music that is very easy to dance to. Students will find the shorter pieces fun and, because of the clear rhythms, easy to learn fingers cymbals to. Experienced dancers can use the longer pieces for a whole routine. All in all, a well-rounded belly dance CD, with something for everyone."
4,Old Movie,Sometimes there isn't anything better then on a Sunday afternoon then watching a old movie with your husband and eating popcorn.With two great stars such as James Cagney and Pat O'Bienhow can you miss. The story was easy to follow about training pilots in the 40's. My husband is a retired Lt. Commander and a navy pilot during World War 2 and thought it was fun. So easy to order thru Amazon as usual. The tape was used but in excellent condition as stated.Good and easy transaction. Very Pleased.
3,A 1930s Gem,"With a light-hearted look at interim period Marine Corps aviation training, this action-filled romance-comedy features a hyper-kinetic Tommy O'Toole (James Cagney) taking on a temperate but firm Lt. Bill Brannigan (Pat O'Brien). It's wit against wit, both in the air and in the local, family-owned cafe where sultry Betty Roberts (Margaret Lindsay) is a waitress who must decide whether to continue her warmish courtship with Brannigan or yield to the arrogant antics of O'Toole who, newly arrived, sets his romantic sights on her - immediately after crashing his ingeniously-shot stunt plane.The air shots are marvelous and spectacular. The war games provide an informative view of early Navy-Marine Corps joint exercise doctrine. And for aviation enthusiasts, the star aircraft - the Boeing F4B Marine Corps bi-plane, especially in flight formations - is unparalleled as a player on the ""stage""."
2,Story Has No Wings,"James Cagney plays yet another cocky tough guy needing to get knocked down a peg or two (or three). He joins the Marine Air Corps on the encouragement of his Marine buddy Pat O'Brien. Cagney is a terrific flyer who thinks he knows it all, and needless to say, he isn't prepared to take orders and be just a regular Marine. He also takes a liking to Margaret Lindsay, O'Brien's girlfriend. So things get complicated. Or at least things should get complicated, but the story is so basic, the dialogue so boring, and the actions of the characters so obvious, the film becomes very predictable, never leaving the runway, so to speak. The acting is passable, the direction efficient, if uninspired, and by the end, I didn't really care what happened to anyone in the story. I usually like Cagney, but other than a few good aerial shots, this film was a misfire from the start."
4,Great Addition to the Series,"This is a good interpretation of the novel, Eclipse, by Stephanie Meyers. Some purist object to the expansion of the ""Riley"" story line but it was aptly explained in the extras why this was necessary for the films. The CGI techniques keep getting better and better. The wolves are the most obvious examples of the improvement. The extras are fantastic! Great explanations of all aspects of making this film. I highly suggest watching them! All in all, it's a fantastic movie and a great investment!"
1,zero stars wuld be better.,I love the film. The disc arrived in to pieces. I purchased two discs at a discount for Christmas season and BOTH arrived broken. that sucks.
5,must have,The booklet is very nice as is the entire set. The pictures are of an nice quality.It is worthy for the shelf of any fan.
2,Not original product,"This seems like a copy of the real product. In the back instead of reading proof of purchase by summit it only reads proof of purchase... I have all the movies and I just wanted to have the original eclipse because I have the blue-ray version, all my other movies have summit writen in the barcode. Other than that the service was super fast."
1,"Unless it ships directly from Amazon, it's made in Mexico!!","Very disappointed. I placed 3 separate orders and 4 of the dvds, including this one, were made from Mexico. It clearly shows on Amazon site one cover with English only text, but the DVD you get is stamped 'Made in Mexico', a different cover, and the Title & narrative are written in English and Spanish. So if the price is 'too good to be true' and does not come directly from Amazon, this is probably what you will get. Yes, you can return it, and yes, it is a big hassle. Hope this saves some people the trouble I went through..."
1,1 disc blu-ray + dvd,1 disc blu-ray + dvd. wanted 2 disc so I can keep the blu-ray one and give the dvd one to my girl.
1,Only For Edward,"Twilight is still my favorite. Hated New Moon and hated Eclipse. Once again Melissa Rosenberg fails in her translating the book. Most especially that un-necessary and ridiculous ""speech"" Bella gives Edward at the end of the film. ITS NOT IN THE BOOK! The only reason I even bother ( not care ) about these movies is for Edward. ROBERT PATTINSON is perfection."
5,Twilight sage Eclipse,The Twilight sage Eclipse book was really great. I couldn't put the book down for a second. I betting the movie will be really great too and a lot of people will go to see Eclipse Maybe 2 to 4 times. The cast will be really great and you will probably be on the edge of your seat the whole time you are watching the movie. And you might be on the edge of your seat when you read Twilight sage Eclipse Book.you all will probably will read Twilght sage:Eclipse book over and over again. As you will probably see the movie over and over again too.From:Marlyn Long
3,Another Saga,I was extremely happy with the price of my DVD especially as it was a two-disk special edition but unfortunately I have had to return it as it would not load.
5,awesome soundtrack,"I really liked the adaptation and the soundtrack was awesome!! This really had you hanging on the edge with Jacob. Read the series, it's awesome."
5,Awesome,I love having both the Blue-Ray and DVD together because I only have a DVD player but can go to my friend's house and watch it on the Blue-Ray. This is a great movie. Its not as good as the books but it is definitely the best movie in the series so far.
1,WARNING! - be cautious of marketplace sellers...,"I've ordered this twice now from Amazon marketplace sellers - shipped by Amazon and warehoused by Amazon.But I received (the Canada Issue):The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Special Edition) [Blu-ray] (2010)Product DetailsActors: Robert Pattinson, Kristen StewartLanguage: English, FrenchSubtitles: FrenchRegion: Region A/1Rated: UnratedStudio: Summit EntertainmentRun Time: 124 minutesASIN: B003L77NL8- the same problem happened with New Moon!------Update June 2012: Ordered a third time from these sellers that put their product in Amazon's warehouse and ships.It happened again. Both Eclipse and New Moon - cheaper Canada versions sent."
2,"Disappointed with vendor, purchased NEW, received Used movie","Purchased NEW movie, received obviously used product. no outer case, no Manufacturer seal. Fortunately the movie was not damaged. Loved the Movie, disappointed with the misrepresentation of the product."
5,Eclipse-the Movie,"I ordered the Eclipse video from Amazon and since it was previewed I wondered if it would be in good shape and worth the money....it was! It had 2 discs, which is great because I love to check out extra info on filming. The best part is that the movie was great! I have read all the books and thought there was no way that they could get such accuracy in the filming as the story progressed...but, they did. It followed the story line and was, in my opinion, the best one yet!! Buy it...enjoy it!"
5,Well-Done,"I have no opinion. However, I would suggest this movie along with the two others in The Twilight Saga. I believe a younger generation will appreciate it the most."
3,ztm,Characters do not have the depth of the book characters. Good movie though. Better if you read book first.
1,Eclipse single-disc edition Blu-Ray,"This item is supposedly a Blu-Ray disc, but will not play on my brand new Sony Blu-Ray disc player? A waste of money."
4,proctorhills,This item was shipped and received on time with no damage. I wanted to start my collection. Read the books wanted to watch the movie.
4,team Jacob,Eclipse is the movie of the third book of the same title in the Twilight Saga series by Stephenie Meyer. The wolves team up with the vampires to defeat the newborn army. Lots of battles between the goodie vampires fighting with the wolves against the baddie vampires. Loved the tent scene. Dakota Fanning is chilling as Jane. Robert Pattinson still doesn't know how to do more than wince or frown. Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black just gets more & more gorgeous.
3,"Good movie, bad quality","The movie skipped, words didn't match the mouths, and some parts were really blurryI would recommend the movie to everyone if quality was better"
1,"It's called Eclipse, because you'll need to look into one after you watch it.",I watched this movie with a few friends at work one night. It was like watching a funeral and a train wreck happen simultaneously. Characters lack depth and are flatter than paper; Bella gets showered with praise and puts it off as if everybody hates her and she's very unpopular. I could not hate a movie or a characters more than this movie.
2,Awful packaging and distribution!!,"First off, I pre-ordered this movie for my wife and I recieved the movie two days after its dvd release date. As an Amazon prime member I'm guaranteed to have this movie on its day of release, instead she had to wait while everybody else was running down the street to Wal-Mart and getting it Saturday morning. My biggest complaint though is the packaging of the Special Edition Blu-ray and Dvd combo!! They actually want to charge upwards to $30.00 for a single disc release that contains the blu-ray on one side and the dvd on the other! I and others find this completely unacceptable and just another way cheapen their product while cheating the consumers!! Also, for a blu-ray that costs around $30.00 where's the freaking digital copy?"
5,Totally awesome!!!,"I went to the movie theatre this morning to see the Eclipse! I was scared that the third movie will not be that good... Thanks God I was sooooo wrong! I would say that this movie has a lot of action, kisses, romance, funny moments and dialogues! I loved it and will be looking forward to getting the DVD!"
5,<3,I love twilight. Even if everyone around me hates it and makes fun of it. I love it and I now own all except part two of breaking dawn
4,It gets better,"I've watched this movie a few times already, and each time it seems cheesier. The series gets better as It progresses. :) I rented it from Amazon to recap before going to watch breaking dawn pt. 2."
2,DVD on a BluRay,"Got the movie for my Wife for christmas. After she popped it in, I was shocked that this is seriously no better then an upscaled DVD. The pixellation is awful, even seems to be using the same hexagon upscale algorithm our DVD player would use. The audio was fine, though was only 5.1 which is a little embarrassing for a modern blu-ray these days.Just be advised if you purchase this to NOT expect Blu-Ray quality, this is at most an upscaled DVD."
3,why so long?,"the product will be fine (i suppose) whenever it gets here. i have used amazon for years and never had any problems. BUT when i purchased New Moon, I was able to watch it on the release date on my Roku instant player at home. SOOO i assumed (bad, i know) that this video, Eclipse, would be the same. it seems I was wrong. now the delivery date is pushed back from dec.6 to DEC.10 ---- WHY? i could have already bought it at the store. c'mon amazon - you're better than this. yuck."
4,Gift,Bought this as a requested gift for my sisters grandchildren. They have not let me borrow it back yet. Oh well!
2,I didn't hate it,The movies get worse as the go on. It was not the worst movie in the bunch but not the best either.
1,No just no,"I bought this as a gift for my fiance. Sadly she actually likes the twilight series. I tried watching, I honestly did. They are just horrible horrible movies. In every aspect. Cinematography, acting, editing, etc, and I'm not even going to touch the horrid story line."
5,Vampires,Movie marathon with all the Twilight movies. Thanks for getting these out so quickly. You just made my daughters day.
3,Twillight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition),This was for my granddaughter & she loves it. I'm not a big Twillight fan but watched all of them.
4,Eclipse,This was the only twilight movie that I could stand to watch. The fight scene is good but there could be more. Overall a pretty good movie
5,twilight saga/Eclispe,"This was a gift for my daughter, who is a Twilight fan. Ordering was easy, delivery was on time. It is a great addition to he collection."
4,Twilight Eclipse,"Love it! Sets the scene for the 4th Twilight install - ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"". This product was a two disc package. First disk had the movie and the second disk has the special additional on-set behind the scenes biography."
1,twilight series.......snooooozeville,"got hot milk? tired, exhaused from a long day working 2 shifts.....can't keep yer eyes opem? this dribble is for you.....teen vampires.....ooooh boy! crappy script.....weak acting.....and gay werewolves.....what a treat for the whole family......burn these discs....wait ban them first .....garbage! not worth reviewing.....going to staple my eyes shut!"
1,I am sorry but these movies are the worst movies ever I bought the first 2 because everyone said how great they are,worst movies ever I have the first 2 on dvd and watched a copy of this one because everyone said how great these movies are and that eclispe was the best one yet well I have come to realize that these people telling me these movies are great must be high and on drugs. Worst acting I have ever seen and the vampire story is just plain stupid first of all they sparkle what is with that I just don't get it I love vampire movies and shows but this one didn't do it for me if you wanna watch a good vampire story tune in to THE VAMPIRE DIARIES on the CW way better acting way better story line also the guys are way hotter the Jacob or Edward first of all I know vampires are dead but does Edward really have to be that pale it makes him very ugly in my eyes I guess if i was 13 I might like these movies but I'm not and I don't Thank you and Have a Nice Day :(
4,Great movie,"The third movie in the Twilight series is a must have for any Twilight fan. It is not as good as the book of course, but it is still very good!"
1,"if you like repetitive angst, this is your movie.","I had to get a case of Rainier to get through this movie. I figured if Bellas dad had to drink tallboys to get through it, my friend and i would need a case. We were very correct."
1,Dumb and Dumber,It would help if someone in these movies could actually act. All atmosphere and not explication. The whole series is so bad!!
4,Eclipse is Worthy,"Surprised that it was very entertaining, not as crazed as everyone else but I fully enjoyed the storyline. It is at least worth the hype to view it/rent it, you can't go wrong if you like vampire lore."
5,amazing movie,"Usually when it comes to books made into movies they are so off that its just not fun watching the movies, and I'll admit the Twilight movies mix things up and change a couple things but for the most part are true to form, and the latest installment ""Eclipse"" was by far the most amazing movie in the saga, I loved every minute of it and it was well worth the hiked up opening weekend prices to see it. I have read each book in the saga (including The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner) at least half a dozen times if not more and I know every detail. I am completely in love with this series and can't wait for the Breaking Dawn films to come out."
4,Eclipes - Better than the Firtst two,"First of all it is the best twilight movie ever. The action was on target, the characters were more believable this time. This movie can almost make up for the last two.The Cullens - you can clearly see the different styles of directing in each movie. I believe the director gave them(the actors) a bit more freedom to have fun with their character case and point Jasper. This character is so much more cooler now than in the last two movies. He is isn't so stiff any more. Edward is much cooler now too, the last two movies never showed much of his humor and his emotions..yes he has emotions...Bella - much much better, she seems more human now....Hats off to the production team and the cast..It is worth every penny."
1,Never again,"Ok the first movie Twilight got me interested in reading Step's books and i went ahead and read all four of them. The second movie was alright, nothing special, but oh well. Now this third movie... My God did they butcher it or what! It jumped from point to point in the movie. I guess it may just be me since i see so many other reviews that love the movie, but come on! Even the scene with Jasper meeting Alice for the first time was terrible. Oh and showing the vampires breaking apart like concrete.... really... seriously... If i could i would put zero, but i did like seeing the background on Riley, since i wondered about how he fell in with Victoria. I expected so much more from reading reviews. Well Do not worry, i won't be putting money up for the fourth movie, oh wait i should pf said fourth movie part one right? Then i should add that no money for part two either."
1,Idiotic,"Kristen Stewart can't act her way out of a paper bag. She has one facial expression, a slightly concerned look with her mouth hanging open. She shows no emotion, no passion, NOTHING.It was the worst $4.99 I've ever spent on a movie. PASS PASS PASS!!!!"
5,The Audio Commentary is worth the purchase price.,"Like so many others, the characters and actors lure me back to these improbable stories. I thought the film was as good as its predecessors until I listened to the audio commentary with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. It is quite revealing about how their relationship has developed since their commentary with Catherine Hardwicke for Twilight. The pair are so funny together that I have listened to them just for the laughs they provide. They discuss In-And-Out Burgers, their hair/wig problems on the film, Canadian shawarmas with excessive hot sauce and all manner of inane stuff. But it is all discussed with such warm comraderie amd humor that I really enjoyed listening. It is my favorite aspect of the film and the reason I gave it the high rating."
3,"Well, I'm Still Going to Watch Them....But","I had been told Eclipse was the best Twilight movie. If by the best, those who hold that opinion, mean more half-naked Jacob, more intense staring deeply into one-another's eyes, more vampire action and kick-butt battle scenes, then they are correct.I found Eclipse to be the darkest and creepiest of the Twilight series. Edward's obsessiveness over Bella is a trait that many a concerned mother has warned her daughter about. And I guess this puts me on Team Jacob by default, but then I'm still left wondering why Bella is such a prize.I will, of course, continue to watch the movies. The story is definitely a compelling one. But girls, Edward's behavior is not exactly a healthy sign to be looking for in a guy."
4,"Good movie, great service getting it","Of course the movie is great, book is better, but movie not too shabby. I got it precisely on time from Amazon and as always have NO complaints from the Amazon service."
1,Bait and Switch warning!,"Be careful ordering this BluRay title. If it says sold by anyone other than Amazon you are probably going to get a foreign made BluRay disc like I did, not the product described in the listing / pictured. Amazon was good about returning the BluRay since it wasnt what was pictured but since it was a gift I didnt appreciate having to run around locally at the last minute to try and find the correct BluRay I wanted. Clear case of bait and switch. Buyer beware."
5,Eclipse Review,"I purchased the Eclipse Movie on DVD from Amazon. I really enjoy the Twilight Saga and have read all the books. I felt like this movie followed the book and was very well directed. I really enjoyed the action and the drama. I know it is a pg-13 movie, but I feel like because of he nature of the storyline it is really for more for older more mature people."
5,perfect,"Believe the hype, the Twilight Saga is Amazing! The movie came in excellent condition, even though it was slightly used. The product came in good timing. The movie was epic, and worth more money than sold to me by amazon, although no complaints for the cheap price."
5,Twlight Eclipse,I am very pleased with this movie and all of the collection. Purchasing and shipping was a breeze and I am very happy to have purchased the complete collection as it is today.
4,Love movie!,Love this movie from the saga! Great adaptation from the book! If your a twilight fan I would recommend this product because of the collectors photos and all the amazing special features!!!
4,The movie is good but the book is still better - in my opinion,"Books that are made into movies rarely compare, and, I almost always come away disappointed. The Twilight Saga seems to be an exception. The movies stay faithful to the plots and characters. The bonus disc is a nice edition for all things Twilight, for the behind the scenes, and the die-hard fans will enjoy the added comments from the actors."
2,Missing Features,"I inadvertently purchased the Blu-ray, which didn't include any special features (e.g., no commentary, deleted scenes, etc.). I thought that the Blu-ray SKU always contained premium special features. I was mistaken. Be sure to check the specs if you want the special features and not just the movie."
3,"Great Adaption from the Book, But can't a fan dream?","Your a fan of the books, this is a definite worth watching experience. I devoured the books. But I have the same complaint with the movie as I do with the book. I think the character Victoria could of been more developed to be an extremely interesting ""bad guy"", with a little more back story. I wish that the final confrontation scenes could of been more interesting, which would of been if Bella was put in more danger. I mean did you ever get a real sense like she was in danger? No. I just feel like they could of given the audience more for the money. (Everything seemed mechanical, not really offering anymore than the book) I wish the movie would of been more deep than the book Can't a fan dream? I can't wait to see the next movie still though."
5,The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition),I loved the movie and look forward to seeing it in my own home.
5,LOVED THIS MOVIE!,"Though this isn't my favorite movie of the series, nor was it my favorite book, I still loved this movie! I saw it many times in the theater and love watching it at home on DVD. I like the extras on the DVD's as well. I recently watched the commentary with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart, and I plan on watching the other commentary here soon as well. I was sad that they recasted Victoria as I really liked the actress from the first 2 movies. I also laugh a little when Victoria's head falls off when Edward kills her. But over all this movie is fantastic! I highly recommend it!"
3,Ok Movie-but the book is far better,"I was a newcomer to the world of Twilight. I only saw the first two film installments, Twilight and New Moon when I started reading the books by Stephanie Meyer. Compared to the film version of Twilight and New Moon, Eclipse was a far better film. However, if you don't read the book you miss the richness of the characters, the evolution of the story and the emotion that Ms. Meyer creates. Eclipse is a fair film adaptaion, but I urge people to read the books in the Twilight Series now, as we wait for the first film installment of Breaking Dawn in 2011. Caution to parents of pre-teen children: as wonderful of a character that Edward Cullen is, do you really want someone stalking your child, entering their room through their bedroom window and spending the night with them without your knowledge? This aspect of the Twilight series-book and film-may not be the best subject matter for children."
1,Blu Ray Menu Item (Play) doesn't work!,"I purchased this with all the other Twilight saga movies, Twilight and New Moon for my wife and myself. We watched both of the first films and then went to watch the third but after the menu loads and the default selected play feature is selected, the menu animation continues to play without a menu available. This makes watching the movie very frustrating although I did find a way to get the movie to play it is a very annoying problem when watching a Twilight marathon... Don't buy this disc. Buy something else like the 2 disc version instead.... Item Returned and purchased the 2 disc set."
3,Not What I Wanted to See,"I want to preface this review by saying, I love the Twilight series. I enjoyed both of the first movies despite the fact I could see problems with both--more Twilight than New Moon. I waited anxiously for the DVD to be released like every Twilight fan. We put the movie in to watch and within 5 minutes I was bored. The scenes are short and seem to be cobbled together--there is no flow. It seems stilted. I kept having to explain things to my husband because they chose little snippets of dialogue from the book, but put them in inappropriate places with no foundation. It just seems that if one hadn't read the book, the movie would make little sense. I'll watch it again because I do enjoy the characters, but with the material available in the book, this movie could have been so much better.I am hoping Breaking Dawn is better"
2,no special features,"I'll keep a long story short. This version does not have anything besides the movie. If you are thinking of buying this version as a gift, don't. If I hadn't been so excited to watch the movie that I tore off the shrink wrap without reading, it would already be on the way back for a refund. As a fan, it is NOT the version I would have wanted. Stupid me, pre-ordering!"
5,Best Movie Ever,All time favorite. I went to see Eclipse in the theater 4 times. Now I will have it for unlimited viewing.
3,The Bridge from Fluff to Hard Core. . .,"OK...Most of what's been said in other reviews seems pretty accurate and I'm no big Twilight ""Super Fan"" BUT why put out the novella about the young vampire Bree Tanner and then, not only exclude most of it in this film, but also most of the key drama at the end of Eclipse where Bella gets a ""look in the mirror"" at what she might turn into--a bloodthirsty newborn, aka ""How can you stand it? I WANT her!"" And just a personal observation, but that's about the sorriest excuse for an engagement ring I've ever seen. I know it's supposed to be a family heirloom, but it looks like a cheap marquisite dinner ring, not the delicate 19th century piece described in the book."
1,"WTF, Amazon Prime and pre-order massive fail","I'm very frustrated. I'm an Amazon Prime member and have been since it started. I've pre-ordered a ton of stuff, and it's always come the morning of it's release. Until now. I pre-ordered this, and didn't even get the shipment notification until Friday, when it was already supposed to be here. Ok, if they shipped it late, I can forgive it once, if they'd sent it for Saturday delivery to make up for it. But they didn't, they sent it USPS, and apparently slowest possible route ever. Now it's Monday night and I STILL don't have it.Lame Amazon - next time I'll just buy it (cheaper) from Wal-mart.I've seen the film in the theater, it's by far the best of the lot. This review is low entirely because of Amazon, not the movie or the story."
5,I love the WEREWOLVES!!!,"My review will be VERY short. I'm NOT a fan of any of the Twilight movies, HOWEVER . . . .I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THOSE WEREWOLVES. WOW, they were soooo BIG. I want one for a pet. Imagine taking him for a walk down a busy city street, guaranty, you'll clear a path with him. Loved making screen caps and printing them to put on the walls. Photoshop me into the pics, ah yes!!YES, THE WEREWOLVES WERE MORE THAN WAY COOL.!Sorry folks, just not a Twilight fan, BUT WEREWOLVES, a BIG YES!!"
3,more young adult than the others,"the special effects in this movie are definitely improved, but the story line is becoming tiresome. After reading other books in this genre and watching more adult movies, I found this a bit slow and definitely ""young adult"" fiction. If I seem to be reviewing the book, I'm not. the movie just seems a bit tedious and even confusing at times. Great for the ""Club Edward"" and ""Club Jacob"" set, but not a serious movie, even for vampires."
5,Love movies from Amazon!,"I love being able to watch my movies online before they are delivered. As usual, I received my movie quickly and without problems. I love ordering movies from Amazon."
4,The only reason it gets four stars instead of five.....,"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Loved the movie but that damn speech at the end by Bella almost ruined it for me. It was quite possibly the DUMBEST thing I have heard in any of these movies. Other than that, everything was great. The acting, the quality of the film and the action. It's the best one out of the three!"
4,editing causes one line blunder,"I really like the movie; however, one line is flubbed on the dvd. As a matter of fact I returned my original order thinking it was just a defective dvd, but the replacement has the same issue. Scene: Edward and Bella talking outside of sheriff's office. In promo he says, I'll do whatever it takes to protect you."" This line is completely left out of the dvd and the line he says is: ""Do you think people have notice how strange, Alice?"" It's irritating."
4,Jacob or Edward???,The movie is great but for all who have read the books you know there's more fight and action in it.
3,It's Twilight!,It's good to complete your collection. They're slowly starting to get better each film. Getting it from Amazon at a good price and free shipping was amazing though! I recommend buying from Amazon to everyone!! :)
3,Single Disc - NOT a true combo pack!!!,"This review is for the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo product. This is not a review of the movie content itself.When this product was initially released, it was not clearly advertised. This ""Combo"" pack is not the traditional Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack that many of us have grown to love and expect to complete our collections. Usually these contain 1 disc with the Blu-ray content and 1 separate disc for the DVD. This product, however, is 1 disc with Blu-ray on one side and DVD on the flip side. The term combo is very misleading.I wish the details of this particular release had been more clear when I purchased it. I would have bought the cheaper single-disc Blu-ray only version."
3,Not as good as previous ones,"I found this last dvd of the series to be just alright......nothing exciting. I may have given it second thoughts as far as purchasing it had I rented it before. If you are looking for closure, you are not going to get it. If you have the first 2 in this series you might as well have this one too. Otherwise it's not worth the money. Just rent it."
5,Who doesn't love Twilight,"I came into the whole Twilight scene a little late. Even though I was constantly hearing about team Jacob and team Edward it wasn't until well after New Moon was out that I even bothered to watch Twilight and what can I say, except, I am now a fan and had to purchase each saga. Eclipse was well worth the purchase, I purchased it through Amazon and got it for a good price. I haven't yet gone through all of the special features, but the movie alone was great."
5,Movie,Twilight is one of my favorite movies collections. I bought this to add it to my collection. It is a wonderful movie.
3,the,"these are OK movies, read all of the books, I think they are for the younger generation, I' m in my sixties and read them because my niece was"
5,Love Them,I love the twilight series. I just wish that they followed the book a little closer than what they do. I wouldn't care if each movie was 4 hours long if it went by the book. But all the same I love them........
5,Great Movies,Fast delivery. Read all the books and loved them. Wanted to upgrade from DVD to BLU Ray. A must have for anyone who likes the Twilight saga.
5,Twilight at a great price,"Super fast delivery, and in GREAT shape. There were no gliches, hesitations, fuzzys, or any other problems. A must have for the up and coming young actors portrayed in this film."
5,Twilight Fan,"I bought the dvd ""used"" so that's what I was expecting but it came wrapped just like u would buy it in store and the back of the dvd was perfect! It shipped really fast and I was able to add to my collection. Happy customer right here! :-)"
4,Better than the original one.,The girls enjoyed this one much better than the first. The original had them laughing with the ridiculous quality of acting and script. This one left them happy they rented it on Amazon.
5,fabislei7,"Loved it, true to form from the first movie. Hope many more come. I will watch them too! Suspenseful. Intriguing."
3,Ok,I didnt really like this movie of the twilight saga it just wasn't all that great. But i needed to watch it before i watched breaking dawn.
5,love it,"having two guys in love with you at the same time,i wouldnt know how that feels,but i cant lie i do wonder,but anyway love the movie and recommend it highly"
4,Enjoyed this movie.,"Good movie. Action, drama, romance, teen angst. Bella must choose between the 2 she cares for most, and must weigh her options, the vampire she loves, who would give her a forever undead life in which she would have to give up her family, and friends for, or the wolf she cares for deeply with whom she would live a life surrounded by her family and friends. But does she really love him? Looking forward to the next movie."
3,twilight,entertaining. easy to use. As far as the movie I am sure that there are many other reviewers out there that can give a more appealing review than what I am capable of.
4,I enjoyed this,This is a good saga. I was never really interested in this but decided to give it a chance. I think I got hooked.
1,DO. NOT. WANT!,"Worst movie I've ever seen. They're all wearing the same shade of lipstick, acting was horrible (like a jerked up Voldemort), and there was no plot! Graphics might be HQ, but the actual film (plot, characters/development, suspension of disbelief (impossible to maintain)) was HORRID.Quality over quantity, people! PLOT OVER WHATEVER THIS EVEN IS (can not possibly be called art)."
1,Mediocre compared to the Book and a certain CW TV show.,"What's with the hype? Is it blind lust for the actors, or blind loyalty for the Books? I don't know, but the acting was HORRIBLE. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the acting on CW's The Vampire Diaries, blows this movie away. After being forced to watch both that show and this movie, I have to say I appreciate the Vampire Diaries show a lot more after seeing this garbage. Yes, I've read the Twilight books, and I can understand why those books have done well. So perhaps I am a bit biased that I hate the bad acting and bad casting, But I've really tried to give these movies a fair chance, and I am amazed how much praised this series gets even though it is mediocre compared to the books."
4,"Excellent Movie, great series!","The version I received actually went back because it was the Canadian version of the film with English and French on the DVD case. I may have been biased after receiving the DVD and being annoyed about that, but the quality also seemed sub-par. I watched a few minutes and it was very dark. We had rented the movie not too long prior to purchasing and I don't recall it being that dark. I think I'll just spend a little more and get it locally.Overall, great move and series, my wife loves them all so far."
2,I'm very disappointed,"I just received this DVD. The DVD is from Canada, The title on the cover is in English and French. I'm very disappointed"
2,Canadian Blu-Ray Or Bootleg Disc,"I don't believe I ordered the French or Spanish edition of Eclipse, however that's what it reads on the box and case i received. Unable to tell whether it's in a widescreen format as well. I guess I shoud've got the French and Spanish Rosetta Stone as well. This disc is clearly from Quebec, Canada. I just hope this editione speciale works cause it's for my girlfriend who is not French or Spanish. Lesson learned...Do not buy from Optishopper, LLC even if it's fulfilled by Amazon for shipping."
2,Love the Twilight series but...,"I'm just disappointed that Amazon lowered it's price for both Eclipse and Twilight the day after I placed my order. I could have saved me a solid $5!However, still a big fan of Twilight and always will be. Eclipse is definitely worth a watch! The cinematography is a lot better than the two previous ones for sure!"
1,Bad,"Ok. I'm not a teenager and I'm not so into the goth vampire scene as I might've once been. I DID enjoy the first Twighlight movie. I found it's cinematography to be stunning and gorgeous, and I found the story somewhat interesting.This movie...well, maybe I'm just too old. It was not interesting at all. The beauty of the first movie was lost. And it feels like a simple teenage drama, full of drama queens and angst.Sorry Kiddos. Not the best."
5,This movie was SO good. I loved it!!,I chose to watch Eclipse because I've never seen it and heard so many good things about it. I loved this movie and its a wonderful movie. If your interested in the Twilight Saga you have to watch all the movies.
4,Keeps getting better,I was very pleased with Twilight:Eclipse. I was on the edge of my seat in the theater. I have seen it twice already. and with the prices of movies nowadays it was well worth it and I would pay to see it again.
1,Awful,"Weak unbelievable acting by the entire cast, especially Stewart. It was difficult to sit in same room with this playing."
2,"Good Action, Not So Good Dialogue","I thought the writing was full of SAP! I know it's just a movie, but I can only take so much of that! I haven't read the book, and this almost makes me NOT want to read it."
2,Not Widescreen,"A bit disappointed that the dvd I received was standard definition, not widescreen as the description stated - and didn't realize it until I was removing the plastic wrap :("
2,Hate the single disc,The movie is great. But I really hate the single disc. The 2 disc edition was not available at the only local store in my little town.
5,Fantastic!,I love Eclipse. I was really anxious for it to come out. Thanks also to Amazon for making it so easy to order. You made a first time order a great experience
2,It was ok...better than the other series.,I never read the third book and I was a little confused about the movie. The movie skipped around alot to a variety of scenes and the big anticipated fight scene was short and average. I did get sick of seeing Bella kiss wolf then the vampire then the wolf. SHEESH~~~~I'm glad I rented the movie; rather than saw it.
5,Eclipse,"I think this is the best one to date, can't wait to see how the next two turn out. They are going to gear it towards the adults this time around, because Bella and Edward are adults now. Just wondering how they are going to do the pregnacy. Will have to wait and see."
5,Eclipse is amazing!,When I was searching for the collectors edition for this saga I was amazed with the price and what was included! Thank you Amazon!
3,I HOPE IT'S PLAYABLE!! :(,"Just received this Blu-ray in the mail with a decent shipping time. The blu-ray is from CANADA!! The title on the cover is in English and French, as well as the info on the back cover. I'm giving this as a gift!! I hope it works or else someone will have an unhappy Christmas!!"
1,Dont buy,I bought this product as a Christmas present and it was suppose to be here the 13th of December. It's now the 19th and I still haven't received it. Dont buy
2,Not That Great,"I'm not going to say that this movie is terrible. It's not. And if you're a teenage girl (or think like one), you will likely like this movie. But for people who like a movie with plot and character development, you're in for a long 90 minutes.First off, the characters are not believable. Every time Edward says EXACTLY the right thing that Bella wants to hear, it just doesn't seem realistic. Sorry, ladies, but no man is that perfect.The best way to look at this movie series is almost soap opera-ish. It's all glamorous, over the top and just not very believable. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect realism from fiction. But I still expect well constructed characters with strengths and flaws. That's really that main issue with Edward. He's all strength and no flaw, which isn't believable and it isn't very fun."
1,after this movie series they will not be able to be inany movie,just what the title says. is this a vampire series or a soap opera. the lamest thing out there. do not waist your time and money. you will thank me.
3,Finally some emotion,"Still not a great movie compared to the book, but at least there's finally some emotion and a little chemistry among the main characters. Fight scenes are good, but not great. It seems this movie followed the book more closely than Twilight and New Moon did, but that's not saying much. Unfortunately a book like this just doesn't translate well to a 2 hour movie. Continue to prefer the books over the movies by a wide margin. Go read a book!"
5,Super Eclipse!,In my town we had a showing of the first two of the saga for one ticket price starting at 6:30 PM Tues. Then the premiere at 12:00. Same theater so you didn't have to move from your seats. This was so awesome. Eclipse was worth waiting for. It was super!
1,DONT WASTE TIME WITH PRE ORDER AT AMAZON!!!!!,I pre-ordered this movie 3 MONTHS AGO and it has been out for a week now and I still have not received it!!! I thought the whole point of pre-ordering an item was to guarantee that you got one of the first copies!! At this point I am the only Twilight Fan who does not have a copy of Eclipse because of AMAZON.COM!!! I will never pre-prder anything again! This is the second time this has happened!!!
1,Where is my DVD?,I'm an amazon prime member and I'm STILL WAITING for my DVD - Why should I bother with Amazon when I could have bought it at Walmart days ago????
1,I wanted to gouge my eyes!,This was complete and absolute spunk! The actors in particular Kristen Stewart are getting worse. I thought that by the time the 3rd film rolled around they would have rounded into the characters. Sadly this was not the case. This was like parody of a bad movie. I can't believe they haven't considered replacing KS and RP...sure they are easy on the eyes but that's about as far as it goes.
1,Still waiting for delivery,I pre-ordered this dvd in October. It was released on 12/3. It is now 12/13 and I still do not have it yet. I am furious. I could have bought it at Walmart on 12/4. I will never pre-order a anything from Amazon again!
4,movie is awesome,i think if you are a twight series fan then you are goin to love eclipse. i cant wait to see both breaking dawn movies . it keeps you on your seat the whole time . the rumor is that the dvd is commin out dec 7th just in time for christmas
3,Got it late!,"I`ve ordered new release movies from other vendors and NEVER had lousy delivery like this. The relese date was December 4th. Other vendors ship the movie 2-3 in advance so you`ll receive it ON the release date. Not Amazon! I pre-ordered it, and it wasn`t shipped until the 4th, and I didn`t get it until the 8th! UNACCEPTABLE!!!! ALL vendors actually have the movies in stock DAYS, and even WEEKS before they are oficially released to the public. There is no excuse to make the customer wait. And to top it off the price was the same as in the stores! I`ll never order a movie from Amazon again, and unless you like to wait, I`d advise you to do the same."
2,DVD won't play,"When I start eclipse, which is a blue ray movie, in my blue ray Sony player it won't go past the title. I have to select the chapter in order to watch it. I have never had a problem with any other movies."
3,new moon,The movie is a great movie but it had a serious crack completely through it making it unplayable. Contacted amazon and got label to return for refund. I am returning it soon.
3,Its Ok,"The service for this product was great, how ever this movie wasn't as big as every one claims it to be. I think its more of the women that love this movie because its based on a love story in general with abe rippign guys and sensative people where a lot of women are deprived. There are some guys like that, if you look at the right place. This movie was too much for me, the plot of it just seemed bland and basic. Love a friend dont want to tell him because I'm in love with a guy the cry and argue over the girl fight for servival and end to be continued. The movies or no where near as good as the books but overal I gave this three stars good attempt, a little bland cool acting and nice screen play and graphical work"
1,Only one disc.,"I am not satisfied at all. I was expecting there to be two disc and there was only one, which is double sided. I would much rather have two disc, but the description of this dvd clearly does not say that there is only one disc. And there isn't even anything special about either of them. I am highly dissatisfied. I would not buy this if you are looking for a two disc combo."
2,Bad Package,"Hopefully the movie works, the box was not in good shape, plastic shredded and the paper cover has come out. Will have to replace the case/box."
2,Twilight Eclipse,"While the movie seems to be perfectly good, the cover looks like a reproduction. It doesn't look like a store copy/original copy. There is nothing inside the jacket, no booklet, papers, etc. This was purchased for my daughter as part of her collection and she wasn't happy with the packaging. All in all it's good for a copy just to view."
3,What can I say?,"Yep, it's Twilight. Wish I could hate it but here I am, buying it. The characters aren't as engrossing as the books, however, the movies when considered on their own are entertaining and the actors actually seem like they're starting to have some fun in the roles. --HK Savage, author/publisher, Staccato Publishing"
2,Eclipse DVD,"I bought a used DVD, I was somewhat disappointed the DVD would only play up to a certain point and then stop."
3,Eclipse,"I bought the movie because I had the previous two in the series and I want to have the complete set. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but considering the books they are based on, they aren't too bad. :)"
2,Acting in this moving sucks,"Rented this movie with my wife. like the rest of the movies in this series, the acting is terrible and the plot sucks. If you are looking for a mind numbing terrible time, this is the movie for you..."
5,The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Two-Disc Special Edition),"Arrived on time, excellent condition, very pleased with the product, would definitely recommend purchasing to anyone!! Good movie!!! Can't wait for it to be a boxed set!"
4,Eclipse,"I was catching up to see the final film. It was enjoyable, the acting seems to be improving. Worth seeing"
5,awesome!,5 stars.would recommend this one to anyone. all these movies are fabulous.. even if they arent exactly like the books.
4,Interesting...,This one is added to my twilight saga films. Can not wait for the last one to come out in DVD so I can watch it
4,Good,"Another great film. Even if you're not into this type of movie, I thought it was quite good and appeals to alot of people."
3,Problem with combo,Just to warn you the bluray/dvd combo does not play as a blu ray in laptop blu ray players. I feel cheated.
2,Best movie in this series so far,"Another teen movie. Wolves still need work, they still look bad. Why dont they pick up the phone and call George Lucas and ask for some advice. As for the love scenes with Bella and Edward...I still have a hard time believing they actually like each other in real life. She is just a bad actress!! I am only buying these so I can see what the big deal is all about. I cant be seen going into a theater to see a teen movie as I am an adult. GEEZ..... I dont think I will be buying anymore after this. I dont care to see the evil baby spawn. Gross."
4,Derailed from book....,"All I will say is this...Kristen Stewart is NOT only the worse actress on the face of the Earth, she is horrible, just horrible in this role (for all 3 sagas) I still believe Jacob and Edward should go off together and make vampire-wolf babies (if that is possible)"
1,Twilight: Eclipse,"I am not writing this to bad mouth the movie!! I am writing this in reference to AMAZON!!I pre-ordered this movie over 2 weeks ago. You would THINK you would get it on the release day. Well NO!! It is Monday Dec. 6. And still havent gotten it. Wow , I saved 3.50, I could of bought it at the store. So people, be very careful on what you PRE-ORDER!!!!!!"
3,Interested Mom,"As a Mom, I'm interested in my child's hobbies and have read all of these books beforehand. I have taken my child and friends of my child to the theater to see all three movies. Although Eclipse is a good movie in the tradition of Twilight (keep that part in mind, as the entire series is not award-winning material that parents would be accustomed to seeing in mature films), it is not the best thus far in the series. My child and I agree that New Moon, of the three movies already produced, is probably the best-acted of the three films, the best-cgi effects of the three films, BUT also the least-believable."
3,The Melodramatic Glampire Love Story Continues!!!,"I saw this with my friends earlier, and we constantly made jokes throughout the entire film. At least it had a little more action than New Moon did, where Bella just cried the whole time. This time, Bella just can't decide who she wants; Edward or Jacob. She is always asking Edward to make her into a vampire. It still has plenty of lovey dovey moments. Victoria still wants revenge and creates an army of newborn vampires who are reckless and don't play by the rules. She plans to kill Bella. The vampires and the werewolves reluctantly decide to work together and fight Victoria and her army. If you are crazy over Twilight, I'm sure you'll love ECLIPSE!!!"
1,The second disk is blank- really only a one disk set,The second disk to this set is blank and doesn't play so it is really a single disk set being marketing as a two disk set. Charging too much for a single disk DVD.
5,My DVD skips - exchanged it and the same thing happens in the exact same spot... <grrrrr!>,I have tried to exchange my DVD (special edition with all the extra goodies) to get a DVD that doesn't hang up on the scene where Victoria is being chased by the Cullens with no success... Is anyone else having this same problem?
1,eclipse,"The reason i am unhappy with this order is that you sent me the wrong movie. I ordered Twilight, new moon, and eclipse. You sent new moon with a movie which was not eclipse part of the twilight saga, but some movie called THE ECLIPSE I would like the right movie sent please as I already paided for it and the movie you sent is older than time, isn't worth the dollar amount I already paid for. I am still waiting for twilight, please correct and send out the right movie (ECLIPSE PART OF THE TWILIGHT SAGA)Thank youCheri O'Neill"
2,Let Down,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It seemed like they just threw it together to get it out on the market sooner. The quality of acting seemed to go downhill too, all the actors seemed bored."
1,Twilight Eclipse DVD,"The first DVD stopped playing at about 30 minutes into the movie. Was told to send it back at Amazons expense. The replacement DVD, which arrived quickly also stopped too early. Again, I was told to return the second DVD, then purchase one elsewhere. I did. It works perfectly.A little put off about being told to buy one elsewhere as I live in a rural area and this was inconvenient.The movie itself was very enjoyable."
5,no noticeable difference between blue ray & DVDs,Great Movie But I can find no noticeable difference between blue ray & DVDsThat warrants paying the extra bucks.
5,On Time,"i pre-ordered this dvd literately hours before it was released, payed for regular shipping and still got it within 2 days! that was great seeing that i was expecting the 7-10 buisness days! :)"
2,Read the book instead!,"I loved the first Twilight movie: in fact, it's what caused me to go out and buy the quartet of books by Stephenie Meyer. Director Catherine Hardwicke brought the characters and the town of Forks to life with finesse and style. The directors of the 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' have done little more than flatten the characters into two-dimensional comic-book fodder. I'm holding out hope for something MUCH better with 'Breaking Dawn'."
2,Deceptive advertising on bd + DVD combo,"Ok on the back of case it states ""...6 part documentary viewable in both standard and picture in picture modes""actually on the DVD side - nothing except 2 commentaries and summit - blu Ray isn't standard so what's the meaning of that ?No digital copy - no documentary on the DVD side :(Great movie - horrible release this time around"
3,worst of the saga,"I saw this movie just this year and was disappointed with it after so much love and hype about it. The acting was not that great, and the movie overall was not that great. It wasn't terrible but was expecting more."
4,Great movie!,The entire twilight series is good. We purchased the series on blu-ray just to have it on blu-ray. Love it!
3,Not my favorite...but still good.,"This wasn't my favorite book either, so I can;t blame it totally on the movie. Kristen Stewart's wig was really distracting!"
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED - MISSING COMPONENTS,"This gift set was advertised as containing the component of collectible cards, but is missing all except the DVDs. To be explicit and reiterate, this set contained: DVD Cover and Eclipse DVD; Missing contents: collectible cards. Don't purchase this if you are planning on enjoying the collectible cards that come with this, because IT DOES NOT HAVE IT."
3,had to finally watch it,"i broke down and had to watch the series, since everyone else in the world already had. i'm 29 so if you're a teen i'm sure it's fine, but these movies somehow grab your attention and make you want to finish the story, but are cinematically pretty awful. lots of people raved about the effects and acting but actually it's pretty terrible. to be fair, taylor laudner (or whatever) is actually pretty good, he's the best one of the bunch. otherwise, snore."
2,DECEPTION WITH SUBTITLES,"GOOD AFTERNOON,I RECEIVED YESTERDAY IN VENEZUELA MY DVD OF ECLIPSE. I'm pretty annoying since PRODUCT IN DETAIL THAT CLEARLY SAYS IN SPANISH subtitled. And when I tried it I realized that ONLY have subtitles in English and French. Can you explain what happened?GOOD AFTERNOON,"
2,Is it over yet? Do I never need to stay culturally literate by watching another one of these on cable?,"I kept blanking out. I have no idea what their problem is or why tween girls would tolerate so much indecision. Victoria's very small story would have made a great episode of Criminal Minds or Buffy/Angel. The music wasn't as good this time. The werewolves dialed down their workout. There was not enough of Dakota Fanning and her movie brother.IS it over?an eclipse, a total permanent eclipse, that's what's called for"
5,Loved it!,"I couldnt stand the books but I love the guilty pleasure of the movie. Some parts were corney, but overall the story is good and I enjoyed it."
3,not like the book,The book was my favorite...and I had hoped the movie would be too. But since the movie wasn't like the book- it wasn't. The movie gives the impression (I felt) that Bella was trying to decide whom to choose. In the book you know that Bella choose Edward from page 1 and that did not waiver.For that alone I should hate the movie. But I won't.
2,Bad. Not as bad as I'd thought but bad,This is probably the better movie of the first three simply because the movie itself is better. I'm still not sold on the actual story though.
3,Slightly disappointed,"Picked this up to satisfy my twilight fix, and add to the collection. Thought it had slipcover to match my other discs... It did not. Also, was duel language on front cover, which made me think I picked up a dubbed version. Overall, the movie played fine, but felt a bit deceived that the DVD shipped wasn't exactly the one pictured."
4,Vamps and vamps,"I haven't seen it but my niece, for whom it was purchased, loved it. Great for teens and people who like the supernatural."
5,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,I love the whole Twilight series and had to have this to add to my collection. I added to my Amazon video library.
3,Just as expected,"I have never been a fan of the twilight movies because that acting is so bad in all of them, so I can not really enjoy the movies. The books are great, but i am not a fan of the movies. You might be better off just leaving your imagination up to itself and not having it ruined by the awkward characters in the movies.I would not re-watch."
2,Does not have deleted scenes,"The sale was not a good deal($13.74). Mistakenly, I thought I was buying the DVD set with deleted scenes. Honestly, how can you call this a special without deleted scenes."
1,Not like it is advertised,"okay so i bought this dvd, thinking that it would be the same as the one pictured, the two disc special edition by summit ent. However i received the video and it was in another language! and not even made from summit. It was awful and when I contacted the seller to complain and get my refund i was never contacted back. It has been 2 months now and still no reply!"
1,No Spanish features,"I brought this movie as a gift, I searched for a movie with spanish subtitles, in the product details saysProduct DetailsActors: Kristen Stewart, Robert PattinsonFormat: AC-3, Color, Dolby, DVD, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSCLanguage: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)Subtitles: English, SpanishBut in the moment to watched we observed that it only count with english and french languajes and subtitles.I really really want to returned it, what can I do?"
5,It's awesome -- of course!,"I was a Twilight ""late bloomer"" (having somehow missed all the excitement when it all started), but I've been catching up in the past few months. Have mostly read all the books (am in the middle of ""Breaking Dawn"" right now), and seen all the movies (several times over!).""Eclipse"" is just as awesome as the first two movies, and I'm eagerly awaiting my pre-ordered copy of ""Breaking Dawn"" from Amazon this weekend. As much as I've enjoyed the books, I have to say that screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg's scripts have given us the best, truest version of Bella and Edward's story, along with that of the amazing Cullens and the werewolves. It's good to read the books for back-story and all the little details, but the movies, including ""Eclipse"" ROCK."
4,"Beware, photo shows Movie Only edition, but the description does not","I am ok with this being only the Movie and no extras. Since the price was low. But it caught me off guard because I didn't notice the bottom of the product picture showing it was the movie only edition. And the description and product title did not say that. Which other Movie Only edition BluRay do say on Amazon.So just be aware that this is the movie only and no extras. A single BD disc with a blue front label. My 4/5 stars is a product review and not a movie review. Overall great product, great case, but -1 star for no insert and lack of product page being being more clear about ""Movie Only"" Edition.I have nothing against the movie or this fine economy edition. But a 5 star BD release would have a chapter title insert and extras of some kind."
4,DVD Blue Ray,"The DVD was great, didn't skip or stutter like the one I had purchased at the store. It was what I had wanted. Even though it came in the time frame that was stated, it seemed to have taken longer than it should have to get here."
5,Very quick delivery!,I received the package with in four days of ordering it! It was purchase used but in perfect condition! I will use this seller again! Both sides of the BluRay/DVD combo disc play with out a problem. I am very please with both the product and the customer service!
5,Have entire series in book form,I have the entire series in book form and have so far collected the first three episodes of the series am planning on getting the final DVD's...I enjoyed them very much
2,Historicism,"Hamilton's book advertizes itself as an accomplishment in finally clarifying for us the confusing and controversial notion of ""historicism."" It provides a good survey of the key figures and philosophical commitments in the history of historicism and attempts to deal with the stakes involved in contemporary investments of the concept. But Hamilton's text turns out to be, at best, a kind of apologia and, at worst, a ""how-to."" Consequently, his assessment--and understanding, I'm affraid--of historicism is delivered from the position of a believer and advocate. This contributes to the reproduction of a lot of conventional mantras about historicism, such as, for example, that it somehow represented--and still does--an ""anti-modernist"" position. We are still modernist, in a sense, and this is why, as this book demonstrates, it is difficult to think outside the framework of historicism. A provocative book, but not deserving of its authoritative title."
2,not really worth it,"The bowl doesn't stick very well (or maybe my son is extra strong?). The length of the ""coil"" on the spoon isn't long enough to reach into his mouth. He enjoys playing with the items."
3,Repetitive,"If I hear the words bogus or bubbly again I'll scream. Seriously, the author needs to expand his vocabulary. The constant overuse of those two words about ruined it for me."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE,I've absolutely loved this series and especially this book! It's exciting and keeps you on edge until the very last word. I recommend this book to any and everyone!
1,Best book however dissapointed,"This was the best book ever! However, i was disappointed that I spent 9.99 for a book that I couldn't loan to my sister on her kindle......I should have just bought the paperback copy so that I could have loaned the book. I think that if you are going to have the benefits of having your book on e-books or kindle you need to be able to share or loan for the 14 days to someone else....I bought this book not borrowed this book. So for those of you buying for your kindle just keep this in mind."
1,A review,This is an awesome book but needs some major editing. Great plot and amazing writing but like I said has some big typos.
3,teens,I bought this book for my Daughter who HAD TO HAVE IT. There's an obsession among teens with this kind of series. Needless to say I didn't read it myself so I can't comment on the book itself.
4,Bubbly-making,"The sequel to Uglies is just as good. Missing is the great hippy commune out in the woods, which has been replaced--in questionable taste--by a found group of ""primitive"" mankind. Still, I enjoyed reading this book and getting back into his post-apocalyptic world of pretty-making. The language is slightly different; or, I should say, the vocabulary is different because even though the book is not in first person it mimics the new ""pretty"" way of talking. Once you get over that it's well-crafted. These books were recommended to me by my mother-in-law, and I hear they are very popular with both gals and guys. I can see why; there is much to grab on to in this series, and it's an accessible and interesting read."
4,Better than the first,"I liked this book better than the first. Maybe it's because I'm more open to sci-fi or maybe it's because it was just better. *shrug* Either way I liked it better. And I'm not a big sci-fi reader but I think the world Westerfeld creates is unique and things are explained well without it feeling like an overload of information. I didn't much like how the rusties (being us) are considered stupid but then again in the 1900s people took tape worm pills to lose weight, we know better now."
5,Slam dunk second!,"I will keep this short and sweet. The second book in the Uglies series bypassed the first book. This book was everything a novel should be, well written, deeply developed characters, well thought out plot...the list goes on. Nothing was predictable or a let down in this second installment. Tally moved from a character I respected, but didn't know if I liked, to a character I really enjoy reading about. At each twist and turn of the plot I was right there with her, saddened, excited and scared. The author didn't trick with any ""easy-out"" threads which completely brought my estimation of him way way up. I had jury duty today and finished the book while I sat there and waited for my name to be called. If I had a glass of wine I would offer a toast to Mr. Westerfeld. Nice job."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"This book was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes read adventure, action, romance, and fantasy!!##"
3,Good but a wee bit disappointing,"The sequel to Uglies did not quite meet expectations, with the characters continuing a seemingly endless back-and-forth between The Smoke (or, The New Smoke) community and the city. Tally becomes a mostly unlikeable character as she becomes 'cured' of the Pretty brain surgery but still retains much of her shallowness. I am not sure if I will read the next instalment due to the lack of plot progression. A good read if you don'twant to think too hard."
2,Why such a rave?,"Boring. As simple as that. I read Uglies and the concept was good enough to finish the book, but Pretties is just boring. I hate not finishing books, but I think I need to this time. Pretties is slow and has no feel of action. There is ""action"", but the writing gives me no thrill. This could have been a great series with the concept of the books, but the writer just didnt execute it very well."
3,Not what I expected...,"I LOVED Uglies. Honestly, I was kind of disappointed in Pretties. I thought it could have been so much better. I just couldn't get into it. I didn't have that same incredibly, amazed feeling I had while reading Uglies. I see that mostly everyone else has loved it, but I didn't. I don't even know exactly why. It just didn't keep me entertained."
1,Pretties,"I thought this book was ""totally bubbly bogus"" I was so sick of these three words that I found the book distracting! I actually started circling the words every time they appeared, (and that's a lot of circles per page!) I felt insulted, teenagers have a much bigger vocabulary!"
5,I read it in five hours!,"I personaly loved this book but....thought uglies was better. But only a little bit. I got frustrated with this one, the word 'bubbly'is used far to frequent i might add. All in all it was wonderful. I liked and hated how she's in love with two guys. throughout the whole book i kept thinking ""What about david?"" Zane is so cool. And during David and Tally's fight i silently screamed no!!!!!!!!!! I didnt like how shay turned out I really hope that she turns from the ""dark side"" in the next book. And I loved the ending! I'm still thinking its just not fair. I give this book a five because it kept me on the edge. I cant wait for Specials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Original,I actually bought this book by accident and was forced to read it but I must say i couldnt tear myself away...even though a bit silly at first it is a very original idea!
4,"Great book, horrible proofreading","I am currently reading (and enjoying) this book, as well as the series. I love the way the story is playing out and will continue to read the books. HOWEVER, the proofreading job could be much improved. The sentences are missing crucial punctuation and cause some confusion. I have also seen some spelling errors. Again, great book, but the proofreading is quite horrid."
4,Amost AMAZING,I love the book pretties I just wished it had a different ending.I stayed up one whole night just to read this book I couldn't stop myself from finshing it.I can 't wait to read the next one.
3,Not sure why this series is rated so highly,I enjoyed this book more than the first. It was a bit more fast paced. The first one took quite a while to get started for me. I wouldn't read it again.
4,A very quick read,"I read this book in around four hours. Its alot like ""the uglies"" but with different plot twists. And okay, the guy named Zane in this story, she like COMPLETELY described him as Zayn Malik. Of course, One Direction wasn't even a band in 2008. Weirdness. Anyways, it's definitely worth reading."
5,The best trilogy since lord of the rings,When I first read the series i was amazed! Westerfeld leaves you hanging and always wanting more. These books are packed with excitment and suprise on every page.
4,Good,"This book was good, but I think I might like The Uglies better. I liked all of the action though."
1,Totally Inappropriate,When you consider the grade levels the editorial reviews have listed this book for I was shocked. I may be old fashioned but think books for youth should not be about getting drunk and other inappropriate topics.
2,Just as boring as the 1st one,"The only reason i read this one is because i was hoping the story line would get better. It didnt. Same as the 1st book, dull, boring, slow, didnt grasp attention. I again struggled to finish the book. Im not even going to finish the series. I just cant make myself read another book from the series!"
5,Oddly compelling,"In a world that finds Paris Hilton to be an interesting person, Britany Spears to be a musical talent and Lauren Conrad to be worthy of an hour a week of attention, Pretties carries an important message. Besides being an extremely fun read, this series has some great inside into the consequences of living a mind numbingly vapid life. LIke a hoverboard ride, this book fluidly tells its story and drives the reader eagerly to the end. I highly recommend it!"
3,Pretties,I enjoyed this book. It continued right on with uglies. My only complaint is that it seemed to have a lot of grammar and spelling wrong. Also it was boring in some parts and I struggled to finish it in these parts. If you enjoyed uglies you'll most likely enjoy pretties.
4,Bookworm!,Hey Bookworms. Ok so before you read the pretties you have to read the uglies or else it wont make any sense. But im guessing that you have all already read the uglies. So you know that the book is based on the future... I have to say that the pretties is a nice continuation of the uglies but since tally is pretty sometimes its hard to keep up with all the pretty talk. they say things like dizzy-making which means it makes you dizzy so wacth out for that and your all set!Have fun reading!
5,I loved it,This book was absolutely amazing! I would recommend it to anyone. But always read the first book firs or this book would not make that much sense.
5,Great Book!,"I liked this book a lot! It was a little hard to get into at first, but once you get further into it, I didn't want to put it down! If you want to read this book, you should read the UGLIES first, or the book will be impossible to understand. The book kept on taking unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you'r reading it. Again I thought this was a great book and I can't wait to read the final book in the series!"
2,Pretties by Scott Westerfeld,Tally Youngblood is now a pretty but her brain keeps trying to tell her something is wrong will she listen to it? I can't believe I read another book in the series. Yes this is my entire review of the second book in the series. Maybe I'm just too old to enjoy this series even though I enjoy a lot of YA novels....
4,So so sequel,"I must admit I didn't like this book as much as the first, but I did read it all the way through. Overall a decent read."
5,BEST. BOOK. EVER!,"THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD!!! A great sequel to the classic first book (Uglies). Tells a great story of life after you become pretty, but your brain is fighting back. Definitely a good book to read, read it now, or you will never have lived a complete life. (Definitely don't read before reading the first book...)"
5,Uglies series,"The first book grabbed my interest. The second book, Pretties, held my interest. It took interesting unexpected turns and left me wanting to start the the third book right away. A good quick read that gives you alot to think about."
2,Punk w/o decent melodies,"If you like punk that won't ever get big because it lacks a good melody, then this is your band. There is a reason I've never heard of the Avengers... Some people obviously like this type of punk, but not many. There are hundreds of groups like these guys out there, but they seem to have better production than most. Doesn't make up for their sins, though."
3,Penelope can rock my socks anytime she wants,"I hate having to give this album 3 stars but i want people to know what they are getting. The first 7 songs on this album will measure up to the seven songs on almost any album because they are freaking priceless, the rest of the album is good too but the sound quality is awful, more awful than any other punk album i ever heard. If the sound quality was better i would probably give it a five. Best songs: ""Teenage rebel"",""(...)""friends of mine"" and ""end of the world""."
5,What a wonderful Book!,"I am right now reading this book! it is really exiting! The way things work in the spiritual realm is really neat! In this book Micheal, the Feignbergs guardian angel, Is teaching Seradim, another angel, the ways of earth. But he has another mission. Buy it from Amazon.com to find out."
4,Not the usual Roderick Alleyn fare.,"This book is not what we usually see when we read a Roderick Alleyn mystery. For one thing, the basic premise behind the book is actually borrowed from an Agatha Christie story. Also, the book is not really a mystery as such. It is more an expose of some criminal activity that occured on the Continent to do with the early drug trade. In it we meet some truly odious characters and Ms. Marsh does a really good job of depicting these nefarious people. We also get a pretty good description of the world of Cults and witchcraft as seen through the eyes of Alleyn and his wife Troy. Ms. Marsh can write a good story, and even if she steps out of her comfort zone, she does a pretty good job with a plot that's quite different from her usual."
3,Not Bad-Not The Best,"My wife introduced me to Nagaio Marsh last year and since then I have been soaking up her books. I enjoy the character of Inspector Allyn but this one just did not really have as much mystery as it did adventure. It was not bad but for those new to Marsh they might want to try ""Death at the Bar"" or ""The Nursing Home Murders"" which I feel are much better."
3,too lurid,"This features Alleyn's family - his wife ""Troy"" and young son Ricky.You can spot the villains from a mile away. There's a little bit of racism on the menu. One of characters, non-Caucasian,just oozes evil and reprehensible desires, with hints that these characteristics are inextricably bound with his ethnicity.It's an interesting read, but the entire narrative darkly foreshadows the secret cult ceremony to come, which as modern readers we can guess at all too well.I prefer the English villages!"
2,Vintage Murder,This publication was poorly done. The layout placed the page type so close to the spine that one has to bend the book open to read the page. It was in average condition.
4,"Ritchie Family, and camp, make this worthwhile.","There's something a bit depressing about this album. ""Can't Stop the Music"" was intended to be anthemic, but falls flat. I think the producers were attempting to change their sound to adapt to 1980 sensibilities, as evidenced by ""rockish"" ""Liberation,"" but this too simply does not feel like the Village People that made its earlier hits. However, there are two reasons I recommend this though only to disco devotees. First, there are some good songs. My favorite is the Ritchie Family's ""Give Me a Break,"" which I think is their best. The Village People's ""Milkshake"" is great in a campy way. Second, one will enjoy the soundtrack more if they have seen the film in all its horrendous glory. No review can do it justice: Xanadu pales in comparison to its hamhanded production and ""plot."" It's so bad it's wonderful!"
5,Very Interesting and Inspiring (and Heartbreaking),"This is an excellent documentary done simply, about the revival of an almost lost native language and the inspiring determination of one Wampanoag woman. So many languages are dying out these days that stories like this are reassuring to everyone. It also provides a realistic look at how some native people are living and remaining connected to their cultures today."
3,POOR VALUE FOR MONEY,"I had this CD many years ago and love the music, but I did not pay as much as I did recently from you. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a product ordered from your company, which usually offers value for money."
3,Dancing Doves,"Sub Sub is the precursor band to Doves. If you are expecting a less evolved version of Doves (and their superb album ""Lost Souls""), you're in for a big surprise/disappointment. Full Fathom Five is a dance album, with an 80's sound. I knew it was a dance album before purchasing it, but I was disconcerted by that 80's sound (the album was recorded in the 90's). There are several instrumental and/or female vocalist tracks. The standouts are the club hit ""Ain't No Love (Ain't No Use)"" and ""Past"" which is featured on the Back To Mine:Faithless CD. I am not sure how Sub Sub evolved into Doves, but it was a positive leap in the musical evolutionary chain."
5,Excellent Guide for Understanding God's Sovereignty,"The Puritan viewpoint is well-expressed throughout the collection, and their doctrines are very clearly consistent and reverent to the God whom they worship. The book shows not only how the sovereign, triune God can be both revered and loved, but it offers insights into His character, delivering them concisely while still remaining poetic. I would recommend no other book above this for an inquisitive Christian to adopt as a daily devotional and complement to their Bible. For those interested in religious aspect of the Puritan way of thinking, I would recommend no other volume above this."
5,THE Devotional Book to Have,This is a collection of Puritan prayers written by numerous authors. It is fantastic. It is different and deeper than any devotional out there at this time. It is separated into categories so it is quite accessible. Your heart and mind will certainly be encouraged by this book and you will want to give it as a gift to all of your Christian friends.
5,Awesome view into greatness of God ( and the past),"This collection of prayers will draw you in and make you realize that Christians just aren't the same today as they used to be... People just don't write or talk like this anymore. The devotion, purity, truth and eloquence that fills these prayers is one of the most spiritually uplifting influences I've encountered."
5,Treasure Trove,"At a recent church service, one of our pastors read a prayer from this book, and I thought it was interesting enough that I wanted to learn more. I wasn't disappointed. This book is a treasure trove! Every page has another fantastic prayer..."
5,A Springboard into Prayer,"""Valley of Vision"" is full of wonderful, Scriptural prayers that provide a springboard into my own personal prayers. They help put me in a heavenly state of mind as I approach the throne of grace. It's a must-have for any Christ-follower who's serious about their prayer life or desires to be serious about their prayer life."
5,Great Book,I was first introduced to the paperback version of this book and loved it. I wanted something more enduring and appropriate and was thrilled that it is in leather. I think the leather edition is beautiful and better laid out than the paperback version.Truly Spiritually refreshing!!
5,Excellent!,"This wonderful material comes from a time when humanity was unencumbered by a ""progressive"" and biased news media filling minds with useless nonsense! Therefore, these prayers and devotional thoughts have a purity and sincerity of faith that is rare in our world. I love to read this book at the start of each new day!"
5,So glad I purchased this.,"only on the 4th page and can't wait till page 5, reading a page or two a day. best book to buy for prayers to read in my opinion"
5,Excellent Puritan Prayers for us to meditate upon,This book was amazing! The Puritans had a real grasp of the worship of God in spirit and truth. They understood clearly the vast separation between Holy God and depraved sinners. They appreciated the love that God extends to reconcile us through His Son Jesus Christ. Study of this book will teach people how to revive the lost art of deep prayer and communion with God.
4,A devotion book like no other,"This book is a collection of prayers written by Puritans. It's unique, however, in that these are not really corporate prayers. They are very private, personal prayers about their spiritual walk. These prayers, each only about one page long, take you inside the prayer lives of people who were greatly used by God.The book is divided into general sections -- such as repentance, devotion, thanksgiving -- but it's not necessarily a book to read front to back. You can open it up and read any prayer and it quickly becomes your own. The words are true to the original, but easy to understand.It's really amazing how these prayers are so similar to situations I face daily. This book is a wonderful way to bring your prayer life back on track or to add a depth you might not have imagined before.I just bought the paperback version, but this will be a book I keep beside my Bible and refer to for years to come."
4,Inspiring Work,This is the best book of prayers that I have read. It is inspiring and revealing. It can be used as a daily devotional or as a primer to get your mind ready for prayer. It also reveals the mind set of those that were inspired to write the prayers. Over all a must have for anyone who is serious about prayer.
5,"""Valley of Vision"" compiled by Arthur G. Bennett","""Valley of Vision"" compiled by Arthur G. Bennett is one of the best books in print. I have used it often! I recommend it heartily to anyone who has a true heart for God."
1,Duplicate recipes of Volume I,"I purchased this cookbook for my boyfriend who has the first ""Garlic Lovers' Cookbook"" from Gilroy, which he loves and uses all the time. I assumed these would be new recipes, after all they have this festival every year. He found that all of the recipes were repeats of the original cookbook and we ended up returning it. Very disappointing."
4,Cute for the queen,"My daughter wore this for Halloween. The costume had a slight flaw, which someone repaired with a type of fabric tape. It was serviceable and there were some nice details like glittery eyes on the skull borders in the sleeves. Hoped it would at least come with the eye patch, but we were able to find one at Target on clearance."
4,Best study of the Ivory-billed available,"This is the definitive study of the ivory billed woodpecker. Tanner spent many months in the fast-disappearing Southern old-growth forests in the 30s, and probably saw more ivory-bills than anyone in the 20th century. He describes their feeding, mating, etc., habits and regional differences.The sad thing here is that Tanner was well-aware that the birds were on the verge of extinction, and the tone of the book is quite poignant.I just wish this edition had more material on how the book affected later researchers and some updated material on the possible rediscovery of the bird."
5,Near perfect,Every song on this album has something different to offer which makes it interesting to listen to over and over again. If you are a Penguin Cafe fan this is a must have.
3,A Little Basic,I was attempting to use this book as a guide for my writing about my experiences as a principal. I was not impressed.
1,Wrong Color,"The Product was not the color ordered, the picture is white. The product was cream colored, and it came in two piece left and right and both pieces were different colors of cream. Apparently from two different dye lots."
1,Molded Tub Splash,This is not a good product. It didn't fit well and was not the color that was stated. The description says white but it was almond. I wasn't even able to use it.
2,"Much promise, little fulfillment.","What a letdown. Yes, the prose is decent, and the premise is undeniably attractive but, for anybody who holds the drive to Las Vegas close to their heart, these 3 separate tales of driving across the desert toward that glittery focal point called Sin City will all leave you feeling cheated. Why? Well, most of all, the author TURNS OFF THE HIGHWAY BEFORE GETTING TO VEGAS! How can you leave out the final 5 miles!? If you have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into a casino, what in the world are you doing writing a book with Vegas at its center? Yes, the author shows that he knows the road, and what the various mountains are called, etc., but he obviously has no understanding of what compels most of us to take that road so many times in our lives. Skip this book and spend the money on a tank of gas yourself. This book has no Elvis."
2,Disappointing,"Last November, I flew into las Vegas for the first time on a bright, sunny day. I had my nose pressed to the window most of the way, and was in awe of the what lay below. I followed the roads through the desert that led to Vegas and vowed to make the drive myself some day. I couldn't believe my luck when I happened across this book. But, the book left me bored and disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, but even the author's reader-friendly prose could not make this an interesting read."
4,GETTING THE BASICS DOWN!,"This book was required for a college course. It is a great book to learn about Computer Science in general. The book focuses on the internet and creating basic Web-pages. You will learn how to work with JavaScript and HTML code. You gain the knowledge to generally understand how to possibly make a Forum website. The book stresses text/number input, manipulation of text/numbers, and then output of text/numbers in various ways. You will learn about the history of the internet, the difference between what the Internet is and the World Wide Web. Yes, there is a difference! The drawback to this book is that there are a lot of type-o's in the code examples. You will learn enough in the book to be able to proof read the example, but it may cause you some headaches."
4,GG attempting to succeed commercially.,"""The Missing Piece"" is one of my favorite recordings even though it has some of the most embarassing moments of Gentle Giant's career. I love ""Two Weeks In Spain"", ""I'm Turning Around"" and ""Memories Of Old Days"" (Truly a masterpiece). I really enjoy listening to this CD now because, as mediocre as it may be by Gentle Giant standards, it still is miles beyond the crap that's being released nowadays."
2,Giant at their worst!,"I have never liked this album! I think side one is GG at theirleast listenable, even tho' the chorus for,"" I'M TURNING AROUND""is very strong and may be the highlight of the album. Low points:""TWO WEEKS IN SPAIN"" and the embarassing rocker"" I BETCHA THOUGHTWE COULDN'T DO IT"". Side two is just a tad better than side one,tho' it's rendered practically unlistenable by it's over pro-duction. ME NO LIKE!!!"
2,Only 95% complete,"We're using version 3.1H (pretty old) and the samples in this book were lacking key information. It's better than nothing (much better) but getting the examples to work was very challanging. It also lacks some key information such as how to map EDI loops into IDOC structure definitions. It's worth the money, but only because there's no competition."
2,An unorganized collection of information,"The book does not have an organized approach to presenting ALE and EDI or it may have one but that is only in the mind the author. There is no good practical information. Everything that is in the book can be found somewhere else like SAP online help and published ALE, EDI papers. If you are looking for advices resulting from personal experience, you won't find it here. Save your money for something else."
5,Great book! it's still aviable if you call the publisher,"This book is out of print everywhere, but I just brought a brand new one earlier this month. The publisher still have about 20 copies left. Just call THOMSON LEARNING at 1-800-354-9706. Good Luck!"
4,Good Primer,"This is a good starting point for EDI, ALE and Idocs. It gives a good overview of what is required and how to map out a plan. Some of the specifics are a bit too general, but again, this is just meant to be a starting point. From a high level perspective of managers and Project managers, this is a good book to have on hand. It will give you a good idea of what your implementation will require."
5,dought,where can i get sap ABAP/4 programming IDE and its Software environment for educational purpose ?please reply with all details.yours faithfully !!
1,Very disappointing hodge-podge of terms and concepts,"The book is terribly disappointing - it has no proper format, concepts are not explained clearly, you have to jump from one point to another point to ""clarify"" fundamental techniques, and yet you find no clear solutions. It is merely a hodge-podge collection of terminology and advice, leaving you turning hundreds of pages and with no satisfaction of having learnt anything."
2,"ALE, EDI, & IDOC Technologies for SAP, 2nd Edition",This is an excellent resource for the novice and the experienced user. A must have resource.
4,"ALE, EDI, & IDoc Technologies for SAP","This book covers the latest R/3 version which hardly to find in this subject. With the latest features, it really helps me to understand and follow."
1,Difficult to read through...vague & incomplete explanations,"This piece of documentation on two complex and core technologies of SAP is simply disappointing. It is not only difficult to read through, but also difficult to understand due to its vague and incomplete explanations of even basic concepts such as IDOCs, error handling, ALE/EDI enhancements. There is little or nebulous coverage of important topics such as workflow and performance tuning.Many concepts have been left unexplained, leaving the reader with the impression that it will be explained later, but is not the case...it is simply misleading. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK!"
5,Well organized and presented book on EDI/ALE,"Informative book on EDI/ALE. Recommended for business users and consultants alike who are new to this area of SAP. Book does include many transaction codes, menu paths, flow charts, and detailed information. Some config screens are explained as well. I was primarily interested in ALE part and though the book focusses on EDI, it was worth it. Saves me time over reading SAP's on-line help. Although ALE menu paths have changed in 4.0 still most of the information presented in the book is pertinent."
2,"Collection of info, but disorganized","I had ordered this title a while ago in great anticipation of a fine book, but was disappointed. It has a lot of info on ALE/EDI/IDOC but is terribly disorganized. To successfully understand a concept, you have to thumb through hundreds of pages to get to the point. This book does not cover important issues like workflow (for error handling) and IDOC archiving very well."
2,Haphazard info - trying to make sense of it is difficult,"There is no doubt lot of info presented, but in a haphazard fashion and it is difficult to make sense out of it. By the way, where is the much touted 4.X material? It is just a marketing gimmick I think."
2,"Not much here, except encouragement","I can't say I got many ideas from this book, but it did inspire me a bit. So many people tell you ""wedddings are SO expensive"" but this book tells you ""yes, you can do it cheaper."" I didn't actually use any of the ideas, most were pretty unoriginal. But it did a good job of keeping my spirits up, at those moments when I was feeling poor and pathetic while planning my wedding."
3,"PS CS2 - Very Good Upgrade - Bridge, well......","Upgrading from PS 7 to CS2 is worth it for the advanced healing tools and the Vanishing Point alone. As for The Bridge, well, it still acts like a product that hasn't quite been finished. As opposed to others on these reviews, I think it's an improvement over the old Browser, but it is a bit slow, and if you regularly download hundreds of shots like I do, you best look at something like Photo Mechanic or Photo Mechanic LE ($50), which can be seamlessly integrated with PS CS2."
2,"Yes, but...","Adobe assumes that their customers are their objects and may be treated as criminals at their whim. Built into the software is a humiliating exercise that inconveniences the user for greater profits for the company. It involves having to reenter activation numbers and serial numbers in order to use your property. If you have three computers you may only use the program on one of them. If you have questions, call Adobe and ask to speak to a supervisor who has no interest in speaking to you. The arrogance indicates that Adobe, (as with Garmin or Nikon) is so far removed from their customers that they are willing to ignore them."
1,Beware CS2 -- stick wih CS!,"If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support!"
4,Alien,"Having never seen the movie in its entirety, I came into this book without having any preconceived notions of what was supposed to happen, as according to the movie. It was an interesting premise, given that the crew was sent to their slaughter to find out why another alien vessel was warning everyone to stay away from the planet, and just what happened to the people that were chosen to host the alien offspring. The most disconcerting thing was that the alien was never fully described, so even though I had an image based off of what little I have seen, I was also able to think up something rather scary to me. All in all a very suspenseful read for me, since I didn't know how it would end."
3,Sometimes you get more. Sometimes you get less.,"Novelizing a screenplay is a funny idea in itself. The passive voice/faux eloquence can certainly be laughable, but the real entertainment comes from scenes that deviate so strongly from the film that you end up scratching your head even if you initially sneer. It's worth it for the curiosity factor, but don't expect it to add any weight or depth to the Alien mythos."
3,THE MOVIE IS BETTER,THIS BOOK IS CLOSE TO THE WAY THE MOVIE WENT. IT HAS SOME MINOR CHANGES BUT NOTHING EARTH SHAKING. I AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER WHO MENTIONED THAT NO DETAILED APPEARANCE OF THE ALIEN WAS MENTIONED. WE ARE GIVEN A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE HUGGER BUT WHEN IT ACHIEVES FULL SIZE THE DESCRIPTION IS FOGGY. ALSO NOTHING IS MENTIONED OF THE HUGE ALIEN IN THE CHAIR WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AN INTERESTING AND CREATIVE IDEA. USUALLY A BOOK IS MORE INTERESTING THAN THE MOVIE BUT THIS IS THE OPPOSITE. ALL IN ALL IF YOU ENJOY THR ALIEN BOOKS AND MOVIES THIS IS A NICE BUT NOTHING GREAT BOOK.
5,a fresh new band playin great new music!,"wow ~ the 2nd track ""Beautiful"" still gives me goose bumps. the harmony is so good ~ they don't overdo it at all. the sound is alternative with a slight pop sound to it ~ excellent! these guys already open for bands like goo goo dolls ~ pretty soon they'll be just that famous! my only complaint is that the cd is only 15 mins long."
4,Great Family movie,We watched it as a family with our 6yr old. She loved the movie and had to keep replaying certain scenese that made her laugh.
5,Blue Ray + DVD,"Love the Blue Ray but, DVD not playing ERROR appears on the screen. Paid for two got one.Loved Charlottes Web:)"
5,Charlotte's web,"Such a sweet story. My granddaughter just loved it. The price was great, the movie was awesome!!!! Thanks so very much!!!!"
4,A Great Family Movie,"Hello,I purchased this movie for my two little sisters and they completely fell in love with it. I thought that Dakota did a fantastic job as well as the other actors. Julia Roberts voice matched perfectly with the character Charlotte (spider). Higly recommended!!"
4,Lots of fun!,Really enjoyed this movie. The voices were done well - they seemed to really match their animals.Good family fun or if you (like me) just love animated movies.
4,Easy Transaction,"Transaction was easy and shipping was quick. The DVD case was worn, but for the price was worth it!"
4,Product great ...shipping late,The product itself was in perfect condition but shipping took nearly 10 days. I chose this dealer bc they are located only 1 state away... I guessed it would 2 - 3 days max for arrival. It became evident that they are drop shipping from their vendors warehouse and do not have product at their facility.
4,Charlotte' Web DVD,"The video came pretty quickly and it is in good shape for a ""used"" item. The case is in good shape too."
1,problem DVD,"we watched it for the first time over the weekend and it has problems and did not play well. I have thrown out paperwork from the box, although I do have email tracking. Can I get a new one still?"
1,Charlotte scares me!,A photorealistic spider that talks yuck! I like the animated version better because I find spiders to be gross looking! I might have wanted to see or rent this movie but the problem is I don't like spiders. I saw the animated version and enjoyed it because Charlotte seemed more like a person than a disgusting spider.
3,Many good moments but also many distractions,"This adaptation of the EB White classic children's novel about the friendship between a doomed pig (Dominic Scott Key) and a spider (Julia Roberts) stays quite close to the storyline of the novel, and its most touching moments (particularly at the end) are a result of this. The film loses interest when it strays off on its own, elevating the character of Templeton the Rat (Steve Buscemi) to a more central role in the narrative and adding a couple of crows (Thomas Hayden Church and Andre Benjamin) as his foils, who do not appear in the book. The filmmakers also added some of the requisite fart jokes that any 21st century family film seems to require, although thankfully there aren't too many of those. These attempts to fill out perfectly good source material feel like fairly mechanical screenwriting exercises and do not add any entertainment value. Finally, the Roberts's pivotal voice characterization of Charlotte is pretty lifeless."
5,A great version if a classic.,Loved the cartoon as a kid. This was a great modern version of a classic. It made the symbolism represented the book stand out very well.
5,movie,"2 year old absolutely loves this movie., it is her second one she watches it every day sometimes a few times a day."
2,Not Faithful To The Book,"I hate it when an amazing book gets adapted into a terrible movie. This is a perfect example. None of the characters in this book were spot-on. Charlotte was the closest to the book representation, but I didn't appreciate her new self-conscious or religious attitudes. Wilbur was second, but the rest of the animals were absolutely terrible. I wish I could cut out the 20 minutes of dumb jokes and dialogue out of this movie to make it a lot better."
3,"Ok movie, but I thought it was animated","I was a little disappointed with this, I thought it was the animated movie. But that was my fault, this movie is good, just not what I was looking for."
1,GREAT STORY FILM IS TERRIBLE,"I loved this story as a child, the animated version is wonderful and I was happy to hear about this movie version, however when I saw it I was so disappointed, no music??? that was lovely about the spider. I will take the animated version any time and never buy this boring version of C.W."
4,Getting hard to find,Having trouble recently finding the Equal Spoonfuls in the big canister. Found it at Amazon for a good price - but had to buy 8.
5,Good stuff,"What can I say? It's Equal. I use a little in my cereal every morning. That's about it, but much prefer it to the other sweeteners. No more than I use, I could probably use sugar.Haven't been able to find it in stores lately, so was pleased to find it here."
5,Very satisfied with Equal .with fast service,"I am so happy I found something with no after tast to me. I am dieabetic and it is so nice to be able to carry the dispencer with the tablets and no mess in my purse. Equal has made life a little easier for me,I wish more stores would carry your Equal,but as long as I can get it I am happy..I also use Equal in the jar for home use, Thank you,,,Ruth Hyatt"
3,The formula has changed!,"I used to like the bulk Equal sweetener for flavoring things like plain yogurt with rather sour fresh berries mixed into it, instead of opening multiple little packets. Alas, in a move to ""measure like sugar,"" the manufacturers have bulked it out significantly more with, apparently, cornstarch. Worse, you can actually TASTE the bulking agent, and it tastes obtrusive and peculiar. I will no longer be buying this product."
5,Everything a great documentary should be,"This is a great documentary, no matter your ultimate value judgements about Roman Polanski's morality and criminality.It covers so much, so well:* An amazing human interest story/biopic of one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.* A transfixing story of the American criminal justice system.* The end of the Sixties in Los Angeles.* The film industry and Hollywood (the Land of Cash, Flash & Trash).* European vs. American sexual, moral and cultural differences.* The Seventies in the Land of Cash, Flash & Trash.* How the world works, per movers and shakers.* The the news media, warts and all.* The lawyer-protagonists: The good, bad and ugly.* Incredible archival footage re all of the above.Do not miss the DVD extras -- they peel back many layers of the onion."
3,Okay documentary; reveals a lot of info,"The way this documentary is put together is at times sloppy, at other times plodding, and sometimes it includes footage which is not needed at all, like the absurdist bit with Polanski moving like a puppet outdoors while a man pounds on a drum. Also, much of the music is irritating and distracting.That said, it does contain a great deal of info about a case which I knew very little about until Polanski made the recent headlines. I don't sympathize with him. He may be a fine director, but we are talking about a preteen girl her, and the use of alcohol and drugs to ply her while she was alone with him. It's about time he faced up to what he did, no matter how long ago it was, no matter that she forgave him 12 years ago."
2,He's a child rapist,"The evidence is there, the girl made her statement, the drug tests were conclusive, medical examinations show evidence, regardless of your opinions of his films, the fact remains he raped a little girl, maybe she was hollywood and maybe her mom put her in a bad position (I am of the opinion she should should have been charged as well, negligence and child endangerment) but in the end he had a choice to help the girl or to help himself to the girl.She was drugged and she was raped. Roman Polanski perpetrated it. Innocent men don't run.The movie is well made but one sided in it's presentation of the facts, no small wonder it was put together by a group of both sycophants and actors who's careers are dead or dying.They should call this movie ""in defense of child rape"" or ""it's not rape if your famous."""
5,Such a fun series!,"I LOVE this series, but #5 and #1 have the best heart-stopping story lines. I've read this book several times over the years and each time never disappoints."
3,History buffs only,"I bought this book because I wanted to see what Gardner said in his first book that sparked the resurgance in Wicca. I did not find it. The book is very dated, both content and style, and some of the authors speculation is far fetched at best. I now realize I read it back in the early 1960's and thought it a poor read even then. If you are interested in Wicca you might want this book for its historic value, but don't expect to learn anything useful from it."
3,Interesting Read/Rambling and Convulted Content,"While I think that people should read this book, since it was the first of its kind and the basis of modern Wicca/Witchcraft, it's no ""How to"" book. It's not even a very good ""History"" book. It reads more like a journal than anything and often tends to venture down tangents and focus (what seemed to me) excess attention on topics that only seemed to be loosely associated with the Craft. Thought/concept organization was fair to poor, but if you're patient and stick it out, it will get you thinking and will give you a glimpse into the mind and thought processes of the Wiccan ""movement"" at the time and one man's role within it."
4,One of the better solo albums from the YES family.,"Even though Peter was replaced by the great Steve Howe as guitar player in YES,it's ironic that Steve has never made a solo album better than this fine effort.Certainly not a perfect album,but very cohesive and not a ""guitar album"" like one would expect..."
5,time capsule of the cheslea hotel,"The film is a collage of the Chelsea hotel-- its history, residents, ghosts. Felt like I was there rather than being told what it was like at the Chelsea."
3,Too bad there isn't a place for a padlock,"I live in a three-unit house, and it would be very convenient if there were a mailbox that locked by means of a padlock. (The landlord doesn't want to deal with changing keys and getting a sufficient number of keys for all the tenants.)"
2,Stores Mail-Minimum Security,"This is not what I was led to believe by the description given. I thought I could use it as a locking secure mailbox for everyday use and also when out of town for several days. However my 12 year old grandson pointed out he could reach the mail from either side of the mailbox with an ""extention grabber"" and thus retrive or take all the mail or boxes out. I wanted a mailbox which would prevent access by anyone other then my wife and me. The unit is constructed well but I would suggest it is just a regular mailbox for everyday use and a weather resistant lockable storage box with minimual security for vacations ,etc. I returned the unit and will look elsewhere."
5,Awesome mailbox,"Had one of these at my last house, and just had to get another. Just put this one on my side porch and it works out great. No more worrying about what to do about your mail if you have to be away. My mailman loves it as it has a nice roomy mail section in the top, and he doesn't have to cram things into my old wall mount mailbox. Looks great, too."
4,Great mailbox!,"This is a great mailbox. I read the previous reviews, so I knew to expect a little trouble with the lock assembly and just enlarged the hole before assembly. The mail carrier was a bit worried about dropping our mail into the abyss of the base until he saw the locking door for us to access the mail. The price, even with shipping, was considerably less than buying locally, which was a real perk. I did paint it to bring out some texture and make the bricks more realistic looking. I'm very happy with my attractive, functional mailbox."
5,LOCKING STORAGE MAILBOX,"This is the second one I've ordered. The first one was rammed by a car and destroyed. I'm sure whoever hit it has front end damage. It would serve him/her right if they do. We had it on a 4 x 4 x 6 ft long post in about 6 - 8 inches of cement. This time we put it on the same size post but put about 10 - 12 inches of cement. Since we were really pleased with the first one, we ordered the second one to take its place."
4,Good Mailbox,"The mail box is a bit more difficult to put together then advertised. I had to use a drill (you are not suppose to have to drill). But once together and the 4x4 post cemented in the ground, it has held up well, doesn't leak in the rain, and it locks."
3,Nice mailbox with design faults.,"The best thing about this mailbox is the added storage. I travel a lot, this is a excellent feature. There were several problems with assembly. First was the lock, there is no reason for the lock should be difficult to insert in the door. Next is the rear access door, the magnet which secure the door is not align with door, which can cause the door to open pushing the mail onto the sidewalk or lawn. This is a good reason to return the unit. Door latching system must be modified or secured not to open at all.Overall the mailbox is a good buy, for its size and price. It would be a better purchase without the design flaws."
5,Perfect,This mailbox was a Christmas present for my daughter and son-in-law. They really needed a mailbox and something for packages. They thought this was perfect.
2,Step2 531700 MailMaster StoreMore Mailbox,"This is my second mailbox like this. The first one was missing a pivotal screw for the locking mechanism. I purchased a screw and all was well until someone missed the curve and took the mailbox out.The locking mechanism will not work in the new mailbox. Once installed, the key will not turn the lock, to the point of breaking a key off in the mechanism.Don't know that I will try a third time.Everything else about this item is great but the locking mechanism is an important reason I bought the item."
4,"Tough, with some fiddling needed to the lock","Not the prettiest mailbox, but seems robust, and will hopefully finally defeat the vandals. Assembly is pretty easy except for the lock - I had to file out the hole in the plastic to get it to fit, and I also had to file the lock spindle to let it rotate within its barrel.All in all I would rate it pretty highly, and the price was right"
1,Problems,This product sounds good but is disappointing - something that has been very rare in my experience with Amazon purchases. Instructions are hard to follow and it is difficult to assemble. Had to use a soldering iron to literally melt the plastic to be able to use one of the prefab bolt holes. Another location was so poorly designed that the bolt hardly fit at all and I had to get a better length from a local hardware store. Looks better than is actually the case. Finally ended up with another mailbox. Do not recommend this and would never purchase this one again.
4,Carcon Filter,"The work well as a pre-filter , and can be reused after washing out gently with water occassionally , I am pleased with the purchase"
1,Not wrapped in plastic,"Yes, great price. But I've ordered these filters elsewhere and they came wrapped in plastic--which made me feel good about their cleanliness. These did not come wrapped in plastic--or anything. Since I'm using them in an air purifier, I don't want to take the chance that they're dirty and germ ridden to begin with. And it's not worth the hassle of trying to return them for a refund. So I'm out about $10 for nothing."
5,A classic,"Have loved this album since it first came out years ago (bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time). The CD was out of print but I kept looking and found it on Amazon (it was re-released), Yeah!!!!Last Steam Engine, From the Cradle to the Grave, Louise, Owls, You Don't have to Need Me - some of my favorites.This, to me, is Kottke in his prime."
3,Great not what I thought,"Based off the image on the web I couldn't tell what the size of this watch was, and it turned out to be quite big. Not as small as the one I was lovingly trying to replace. I still like the watch though! Just know it doesn't fit snug on a little wrist. Its not big enough to fall off."
5,Good Good Good,"I Love it! It fits well with my music collection. I highly recommend it! If you like Leo Kottke, you'll love this CD!"
5,Classic Belly Dance Music ..,Another great recording known and loved by American belly dancers. Abdo produced 5 albums in the series: Joy of/ and Magic of/were the best of these.
3,"small, sturdy bookcase","Bookcase dimensions are listed correctly. I purchased it for a child's room where smaller is better. The hardwood is ""good"" quality. I think that some of the lower cost may come from joining many smaller, selected pieces to assemble the whole. The cuts and finish are ""very good"", especially at this price. My kit was missing one end cap. Otherwise I am completely satisfied with the purchase."
1,"Not 4-tier, really 3-tier","Be careful with this item. It is described as ""4-Tier,"" but that is a lie. There are only three shelves."
3,pricey but needed,"i needed a tall, slim bookcase to put at the foot of my bed in a small bedroom so i could put my 37"" t.v. on!! sweet!! this bookcase served the purpose. my only gripe is that for a DIY item i felt is was overpriced. ($100)"
3,"nightmare to assemble, decent quality wood","Bought this for a baby's room. I am not mechanically inept by any means. Quality of the wood seems solid. The holes for all the screws to assemble this aren't drilled wide enough to turn in easily, you are literally grinding your hand away, i stripped three allen wrenches, it was so hard to turn the screws into the holes. I wouldn't buy another one of these again."
4,Winsome Bookshelf,"The bookshelf is great! It is the perfect height for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and fits all of her books nicely. The bookshelf is a little wobbly, which is my only concern, but other than that it serves it purpose for the price. Upon arrival, one of the shelves was cracked and after calling amazon, it was replaced immediately."
3,"You take the good, you take the orange...","I bought this bookshelf after purchasing the matching Winsome Wood desk a few months ago. For the price, I am happy. I love my *desk* and the finish is very nice. The *bookshelf*, however, is far more orangey-red (the color of Doritos!) than the other Honey-colored piece I own. The piece I received is not as shown in the photo. Also, it has a rough feel to it, too, as though it wasn't sanded properly (which goes hand-in-hand with the blotchy finish).5-stars for fast shipping, good packaging, easy assembly, nice size and quality (nothing warped or damaged).2-stars for rough texture on the shelves and an unattractive stain color. I will probably end up sanding it and then painting it white."
3,"great customer service, poor quality","I gave this bookshelf 3 star because it is exactly the size bookshelf we wanted for our baby's nursery. We ordered the honey color to match the Davinci crib set, however the shelf has a little more of a reddish orange tone. I am 6 months pregnant and I was able to assemble this alone...very easy. Once I started assembling I realized, one of the 3 shelves was different thickness and the side pieces were warped a 1/2"". We called the company directly, who walked us through the process of obtaining replacement parts at no cost. We received the replacement parts with 10 business days, and unfortunately the side pieces were warped more than the original with significant wood defects that appeared to be filled in with wood glue....the replacement shelf was perfect, which we used with the original side pieces we received. Customer service was fantastic, however product quality was poor."
4,Nice Shelves,I bought two of these for my son's bedroom. They work really well. My only complaint is that one of them was difficult to put together because the holes for the top shelf were too deep so the screws wouldn't anchor in. We had to get creative with some filler.
4,"Sturdy, good-quality bookshelf","Overall, I was quite satisfied with this bookshelf, though it was a bit of a pain to assemble. The wood screws used have very shallow heads, which makes them easy to strip, and you're not given any extras. The guide holes on the shelves are also relatively small, so you have to exert quite a lot of torque just to screw them in. The combination of the two means that it's easy to strip the screw and then be unable to remove it.Other than that, however, I'm quite happy with the shelf now that it's assembled. It's made of sturdy, good-quality hardwood and has a nice finish, which is pretty good considering the price range."
3,Almost but...,"This bookcase is very nice. It will fit into most decorative styles but the finish is slightly too red to really fit in well. These are nice bookcases but not ""the perfect piece."""
5,Solid bookshelf,"Assembled in less than 20 minutes, seems very solid, actually made of wood, not pressboard, looks very nice. We are ordering another for a different room."
5,Very nice for the price!,"This solid wood bookcase took only about 15 minutes to assemble. It is helpful to have a second person to align pieces as you screw in the fasteners, though. Bookcase was level after assembly and the finish was even throughout. Filled it up with books and shelves were still strong and stable. A good purchase."
4,Winsome Bookshelf,"The shelf arrived on time, was easy to assemble and meets our needs. Good quality for the price. Very sturdy."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by this. I bought this over a set of shelves being sold in my local store because I was looking for a taller shelf unit. I wish now I had bought and stacked 2 units from my local store, which would have been about the same cost, but would have given me a tall well finsihed shelving unit. The differnce in wood quality and manufacture is stark. This is a roughly made piece of furniture in terms of finishing. The orangy wood finish is not like any wood coloring I have ever seen, so I shall have to get wood polish/stain and darken the color, which might also give the wood a richer less cheap appearance. The wood is poorly finished feeling quite rough and some of the wooden segments had minor yet visible chips. I only kept this because I couldn't be bothered with returning it and because it is in a location that is not too visible."
3,A good light read,"I was actually disapointed in this book. Given the authors background I was hoping for a book that went into some detail into his methods, beliefs and techniques of crisis negotiation. What I got was a very light but enjoyable read that covered his career in the FBI (including his battles with the beaucracy which I felt did not add to the story) and four incidents of crisis negotiating, which had some good basic tips. Waco got a mention - but only to say he will leave it to the next book - rather frustrating.My recommendation is, if you want a book on techniques, buy one of the others on the market (for example Van Zandt's fellow ex-agent Fred Lanceley's ""On Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators"", or even Frank Bolz 'Hostage Cop""), but if you want a good read and an interesting story then this would be a good book to get."
5,Interesting Read!,Easy to read. Interesting story of authors time in the Bureau. Good insight into this field.
2,A Big Disappointment!,"My husband and I listened to the audio unabridged version of this book. We would have preferred Mr. VanZant to include the details of more of his cases as an agent or private contractor thereby revealing his personal views relative to the actual negotiations involved, rather than to dwell so much on his personal philosophy, which he endlessly repeated. We felt that his philosophy regarding hostage negotiation would have been revealed just as well and more interestingly if he had gone into specific details of each case."
4,Forget Me Nots & Remind Me - IMPORT,"This CD has some excellent gems for those who like more high gloss soul from the late 70s & early 80s. Such jewels as ""Cha Cha"", ""Wishful Thinking"", and ""Where there is love""... have beautiful instrumentation which seems to mix jazz, soul, and even some classical all in one. Of course her big hits, partially named in the title, are included here, but the lesser known songs are what MAKE this anthology. It's a shame that songs like ""High in Me"" and ""I need your love"" aren't on this album, but the collection is still great. These tracks display a good mixture of strings, piano, classical guitar, and bass which may have influence other bands of this time period like CHIC, with whom she toured. This compilation is a must for die-hard Patrice fans or those who like mellow music with a touch of class."
2,Good information but ...,"I'm a homeschooling mother and therefore I'm always on the look out for great educational books. This book might be a great resource for older children but definitely not for any child under the age of 10. It is too long, the language is not engaging and there are very few images or illustrations and the ones there are, are black and white. In my opinion the book is not stimulating enough, children are used to brightly colored images, and therefore this book is just not cutting it. It's a shame really, the information is valuable but not enjoyable."
3,gritty and edgy,"A lot of people did not like this book. Folks you could do much worse. This book moves quite fast and you need to pay attention otherwise, you will lose the plot.The writing style for this book reflects the anxiety of the main characters as they track the components for a dirty bomb through Central Asia. If that was the intent then the authors achieved their goal.However, I think they missed an interesting subplot by not playing up the friction between Corrine (the lady lawyer) and Ferguson (who is trying to get killd before he dies of cancer).This is an average thriller against the back drop of the War on Terror."
2,Huge disappointment from Larry Bond,"I have been an ardent Larry Bond fan from ""Red Phoenix"" on and have all of his previous books in my home library. I immediately purchased this new novel as soon as available with great expectations. Alas, was not to be. This book was terribly disappointing, and a hard to finish reading. The story was choppy, the characters only cardboard cutouts that you could care less about. Nothing was in-depth and read like a book thrown together overnight by a couple of buddies over a beer. Even the hero, Ferguson, seemed more of an accident waiting to happen, and inept to say the least, to be leading a special forces strike team. Sorry Mr. Bond, but if this is the first book in a planned series, I surely hope that more thought and depth goes into the sequels. Try reading some Vince Flynn novels with hero Mitch Rapp to get the right idea of some great action stories."
4,Tip of the spear,"The main reason I gave this book 4 stars was the perceived realism. I don't know if it was real or not but my perception was that it was real. Does anyone know if SEAL's and Force recon dudes don't get along? Did they really build a plane, great story. Tip of the spear type stuff. Hard decisions, good guys die. Thanks Nick, can I borrow the others?"
3,OK,"This was an OK book. I like both Mr. Bond and Mr. DeFelice but this book lost me after a while. I actually know when it lost me, when the authors put a 26 year old female lawyer in charge of a special operations force. Huh. The plot was interesting but the characters needed more clarity. I loved Ferguson but I knew very little about him. I now must buy the next book in the series just to find out what happens to him. Just don't waste your money on the hard cover like I did. They are direct to paperback worthy only."
2,Unengaged.,"Potentially a good plot, but anemic characters. Lots of action was developed and a good action movie could be made of it, but I found myself flipping through the book as if it were a little animated picture booklet, and I don't think I missed much."
5,Different thriller,"The plot of this book follows the normal thriller pattern - you meet the hero, there's a problem, more problems, blind alleys, etc. Which is all good. It moves very fast and there's a lot of action, etc. It doesn't skimp on combat, etc.But what stood out for me were the characters. They actually seemed affected by what happened in the book - they were more like real people, even the supposedly minor ones, than a lot of other books I seem to be reading these days. So much so that at some points they did things that annoyed me, even though they made sense to the characters themselves. By the end of the book I really cared about what was happening to them and I wanted to find out more - which I think is a sign that it was very good. I'd definitely pick up a sequel."
1,Imagerman,"Well, was I ever disappointed in this latest Bond adventure. It rambled, too many characters, too many cute, non realistic comments from characters to others. Overall, just a poorly structured, rambling, mish-mash about nothing.Larry you had better see if Larkin is still available if this is an example."
5,The Best Dancehall Ever,"It is sad that Terror did not stay at it, because nobody came close to conveying the same energy in Jamaica than he did. Every song pumps you up. The voice is tops. The bass thumping. The beat beautiful. Seek this guy out."
1,My request for this book,It's a ok book but it just repeats some of the words over and over again and again some people like that but l don't like that.
4,Biscuit,"This book is about a little puppy that needs to go to bed, but little Biscuit doesn't want to. He keeps wanting to play, eat, hear a story, then he goes to the little girls room to curl up with her. He finaly falls asleep when he lays on the girls blanket on the floor. I thought this book was so cute. The pictures were really good. This book teaches the children how some pets need this much attention and how they don't always do as they are supposed to."
4,A Great Book for your Baby or Your Beginning Reader,"We bought this book for our daughter the year before she started Kindergarten, in hopes that it would help to get her started with reading. And it indeed turned out to be one of the first books she was able to read alone. She is in first grade now, and her reading level has progressed well beyond Biscuit. But we have found renewed life for the book with our one year old baby. He loves Biscuit. It is his favorite bedtime story, and he never tires of hearing it. The delightful story of the little yellow dog who finds excuse after excuse not to go to bed will enchant your children, from infancy to elementary school."
4,A Comforting Story for the Beginner Reader,"Biscuit is a cute ""small, yellow puppy"" owned by an equally adorable 3 to 6 year-old, auburn-haired girl. Most of this 21-page book is in the following format:Time for bed, Biscuit!Woof, woof!Biscuit wants ...What does Biscuit want? Well, he wants ""to play, a snack, a drink, to hear a story, his blanket, his doll, a hug, a kiss, a light on, to be tucked in, one more kiss, one more hug, and to curl up."" Thirty-five simple words are introduced and many are used over and over again so that the text eventually averages a little more than six words per page. This warm, comforting story is perfect for a child who has just started to learn to read."
5,Should Be Biscuit's Bedtime,"This is the first Biscuit book, wherein we meet the small yellow puppy and the-girl-in-purple-sneakers. It is bedtime but Biscuit, like many children, does not want to go to bed. Instead, he wants to play, snack, drink, get hugged, have a blanket, etc.Many parents will recognize what Biscuit is doing, avoiding sleep and getting more ""mommy time."" But in the end, what Biscuit winds up with is to be asleep but not in his own bed, but near the little girl.Adorable illustrations really make this a fun book for children (sometimes I have my daughter read Biscuit's part, ""Woof, woof!""). A great book. Read them all."
3,Beautiful but...,The silk is so slippery it makes this carrier hard to work with. It is so beautiful I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. Anyhow I called Moby customer service and they were SO friendly and helpful. They exchanged it for me with no hassle. Moby is great but not with the silk panel.
4,Runs large but very WARM,"Got this for my hubby that works at the local Zoo. He can be out in the weather for hours on end, often in damp conditions and needed a warmer pair of overalls for some days. He used these twice so far and they have been very warm and resist water somewhat although not made for it. They are very stiff and need to be washed before wearing, and they run large and do not shrink upon washing. I wish I had known before they ran a bit larger, presumable to allow for layering but with these in our weather they are enough to have jeans underneath. Very easy to get on and off, even with clunky heavy shoes."
2,fits small,"i buy two sizes up from what u really r with these, they also don't offer some sizes in long which is BS"
1,Not at all this color,"the ring that I got doesn't look ANYTHING like this picture...the enamel portion is BEIGE..the stone in the middle is a flat brownish/pink color..there is nothing PURPLE on this ring and it looks NOTHING, NOTHING NOTHING like this picture...very disappointing as I purchased to wear w/ a bridesmaid dress and this certainly will not work....what a drag..."
2,Does every 5-star band have a 2-star album?,"If you are new to Gentle Giant, or you have one or two albums and want to expand, you might want to skip over this one. This album is what ""Under Wraps"" was to Jethro Tull or ""Love Beach"" was to ELP. Ok, ok, the Love Beach thing was a low blow. Let's just say... Giant For A Day is for the hard core fan only. For a better ""later"" GG album, try ""The Missing Piece""."
2,Gentle Midget,"This is unfortunately the worst Gentle Giant (which is weird to say since all the rest are good!) The band hit a very low point with this, their second to last album. The only songs that are worth mentioning are the title track, Words to the Wise, and Friends, which is the only song featuring drummer John Weathers on lead vocals. Most of the rest are very bland. One of the really bad songs is Spooky Boogie; extremely un-Gentle Giant.I'd only recommend getting this if you have every other album and only want to complete the collection.JR"
1,Their worst by far,With the exception of John Weathers' blissfull song 'Friends' there is not a good track on this CD. It is filled with tired half rock songs. Musically they were totally lost. Incredibly they manged to recover from this disaster to produce the much more listenable rocker 'Civilian'. Gentle Giant were never a good rock band though. Stick to early stuff to find what they really about.
1,Sadly...a really mediocre GG album.,"Bowing to pressure from the record companies, GG did the only thing they could at the advent of the punk era: they sacrificed much of what made their music great in the first place in order to appeal to a wider audience. The result is a band that sounds very tired indeed. 'Words From The Wise' is a great attempt at a prog song, with the harmonies that made GG famous, although the music itself tends to be very dumbed down, and the rest of the CD is just filler tracks. Purchase with caution."
3,Whimsical Fun album...,"I am wondering if it is an ""American cultural thing"" to root out ""the weakest link"" and proceed through to negative de-construction... Maybe it's the ""American Idol"" era we live in where the best can not be appreciated without slamming, rejecting and ridiculing the lower ranks.Where am I going? This Gentle Giant album gets slammed left and right. In truth it is a whimsical, fun album with a lot of polish on it. It is ""pop"" flavored. It is not nearly as cataclysmic, complex and ferrociously ecclectic as their famous albums. It is not a prog-rock masterpiece in the ""file next to Close to the Edge"" realm. To top it off the album cover is a bit goofy.So what!For the price of admission, this album is enjoyable. Gentle Giant is a great band and their 3 star work is still worthy of investigation. There are good times lurking in these grooves even if it's a few stars short of a ""classic"" in status. Those familiar with GG know they proved themselves already. Enjoy it."
3,Giant's weakest album,"but as another reviewer wrote: if you combine the best tracks from this album with ""Giant for a Day"" (particularly ""Word for the Wise"")you'd have a four star album.""Brown Bag"" is probably the most straightforward rocknroll to come from Giant.As for the execrable ""Friends"", the less said the better."
3,Shame on Guitar World mag for saying this is the best GG Lp,"I am writing this especially for anybody who read Guitar World magazine in Feb or March where in their progressive rock story they recommended this cd as the best of Gentle Giant.This can be only true if the only other GG cd they listened to was ""Civilian"".I am being generous with a three star ratingWhile I would not recommend a person new to progressive rock to listen to GG lps like ""Acquiring the taste"", ""In a Glass House"" ,""Three Friends"" which are really out on the edge; I would'nt recommend ""Giant for a Day"" because it is not that far from a Michael Bolton or Richard Marx cd.Instead, first listen to ""The Missing Piece"" cd (See my review of the cd there), then try ""Octopus"", ""Freehand"", ""The Power and the Glory"" and the two great live cds ""playing the fool"" and ""king biscuit flower hour presents"""
2,A Cave-In,"-The band finally caved to their label's insistence that they do a ""commercial"" album.They didn't know how to make commercial music, and it shows (they finally figured it out on the next (and last) album, CIVILIAN, but by then it was too late).There are only one or two good songs here - everything else is as embarrassing to GG fans as TORMATO is to Yes fans!But, I have to say the guitar riff that opens ""Little Brown Bag"" rocks my face off.Completists only need apply.-"
2,It's not that bad....,"Back in 1978, after buying half a dozen other Gentle Giant albums (I especially recommend the PRETENSIOUS best-of), I thought this was The Worst Album Ever Made. Though this is MILES more commercial than their earlier work, it's not even close to being the Worst Album Ever. There are at least 3 keepers: The opener ""Words from the Wise"" starts with the Gregorian-chant style old GG fans love & then works out from there. ""Take Me"" is a sweet love song with nice choruses. ""Giant for a Day"" is obnoxiously catchy Jethro-Tull-like fun. The rest are at least inoffensive. Nowhere near as tricky or intricate as the earlier (recommended) FREE HAND, OCTOPUS, THREE FRIENDS, POWER AND THE GLORY, ACQUIRING THE TASTE, etc., but worth a listen for the open-minded...."
1,If you have to drive,"for a long time through an unknown land and be at the mercy of the musical taste of the local radio station's DJ, this album is a good alternative - it will not distract your attention from reading the road signs. Yet you may enjoy some guitar passages and the vocals on Words Of The Wise, bits and pieces of the old glory (but not the old power). Amazing is their ease of imitating different musical styles but overall the music is mediocre though some pieces would make an honor to such groups as Aerosmith or Bon Jovi."
1,wrong description,"The FEL-PRO HS 9105 PT HEAD SET is for GM V6 207ci 3.4L OHV 12V 1995-93.I got it for a 1996 Lumina LS with a 3.1L motor, stardard for its class.This set is for the Lumina APV that came with the 3.4L motor.Since I have this parts sendded to me outside the states, I dont have the option of returning it.In another ocation I asked for a temperature sensor for the same car, from another vendor and received a brake drum for a Toyota camry.Frustrating."
4,Environmentally Conscious and Still Fun,"This documentary focuses on one industry's struggle to promote and carry out green practices. The film industry may appear to have it all together environmentally, but they clearly do not. While their lack of cooperation was a bit upsetting, the movie crew provided the film with a source of conflict, which helped to keep the movie interesting. While environmental consciousness is usually portrayed in a very dry manner, this film has a much lighter approach, with jokes and quips interspersed fairly evenly throughout. At times this film seems more like a making of the movie The River Why, but it still has its own message. It doesn't call for us to leave our cars at home or hardly ever flush our toilets. It's much more real that. The film asks us to question our consumption and promotes the idea that the little things, like water bottles, can be huge if we all commit to them. It's a good quick film that's fun even while it makes you think."
2,Was this really necessary?,"Horrible acting is made up for by special effects.The original movie, much better by far, had a tighter story with less silliness and no gratuitous gore.If you're seeking something for the special effects ONLY... then this is for you.If you want a story and good acting then stay far far away.Doesn't even rate to a 'B' movie subcategory!"
4,it'll have carolyn greer shaking in her floopy sandles,"I thought this movie was good the special fx were brill. and if you watch the documentry on the d.v.d about the make-up of the ghosts it is truly spectacular!so if your 'dennis j. gault' you can just f**K yourselfanyway I thought it wasn't very scary but hey there really aren't any scary movies out there anyway, but some parts did make you jump."
1,"A horrid, not horror, film","I found this to be a horrid, not a horror, film. This film is typical of today's horror movies: production values over the top and storyline and originality lost in the bottomless pit of the phantom zone. The gimmicks, clichés, and the twisted ending are all part of the course in this movie: all meant to gross you out instead of mesmerizing you with intrigue and mystery. The original and dated 13 Ghosts movie of 1960 has a far better chance of mesmerizing you than this over budgeted and poor excuse for a Hollywood bromide."
4,Thirteen Ghosts,"The condition of this movie was great, but I ordered new so I expected that. I would have liked to have known that the case on this movie would be a peper-like case with a side clasp to open it."
5,scary house,"i gotta give this movie a 5 cause it's good enough. consider this not a chainsaw massacre but images scary enough to be horror. don't underestimate this movie if your not one for thistype of movie. like i said its not hardcore, but scary enough.in the way of creepiness i would say that would be the movie with nicole kidman the others. it's a buyer if you are alrightwith this type of movie. not for kids"
4,cool ghosts,"This was an allright movie and in no way qualifies as ""the worst movie ever"" nor does it qualify as ""the best movie ever"". I thought the movie was good because of the ghosts alone. Granted the acting was bad and the story had holes in it and unecessary plot twists, I think that the jackal and the angry princess along could have won the movie, they are both deeply disturbing characters in their own respects, watch their back stories on the dvd to see what I mean. Overall it was a good action movie but don't expect to be too scared, personally the ghost descriptions on the dvd are more frightening then the entire movie"
4,Number 1 most scariest movie ever!,"This movie has bad acting and was very cheesy. But if you are looking for a movie so scary that you have nightmares for 2 weeks, than you have to see this movie!"
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be.,"The producion desiegen on this flim is amazing. The editing is great. The idea is a good one, but lack of logic, and coney script, make this very fast paced flim very forgetable. Even though some of the Ghosts are awsome looking. My favorite on is the Jackel. Rent this before you buy. I am glad I did. The last few years have seemed pretty uninspired time for horror movies."
3,Pretty cool film,"Thirteen Ghosts is a decent film and looks pretty good on DVD. I found this film to be fun and entertaining at times. I didn't find it all that scary but it's still good. The film does have a cool story, gore, and some nudity. The features on the DVD are pretty cool also. I liked the Ghost profiles that gave a brief history on the ghosts. It was cool to see how they became ghosts cause the film doesn't go into very much details. Also check out the original film which is also a fun movie."
2,The second star is for the production design...,"I was horrified by this remake of William Castle's 1960 film. The characters are weak, the continuity errors are numerous, and I was highly disappointed. A second star went to the production design, however, which was brilliant. The house was well designed, the makeup was good. See the original, unless you're looking for a no-brainer horror film with cheap thrills."
2,Cliche Scary Movie,"When I normally review a movie, I tend to review movies that I liked, but this is an exception.When I started watching this movie I was more than eager to see how it would turn out; after all, it was written by Robb White, the same person who wrote House on Haunted Hill. But as I emmerced myself in it's ""plot"" I couldn't help but to notice that it was nothing more than a different version of House on Haunted Hill. However, unlike House on Haunted Hill, this movie tends to lack substance. Sure, it had a concept behind it, but a bleak one at that.By the end of the movie I was highly dissatisfied at it's lack of a thicker plot. It left me empty and wanting more insight to the story. I won't put any detail in my review about the actual plot as it would spoil it for those that _might_ actually want to see it.I apologize to those that thought this movie deserves 5 stars, but it truly doesn't."
2,Glad I didn't buy it!,"From the moment this movie started I could tell it was going to be a dud. Sure enough, that's how it ended up. The only thing I liked about this movie was some of the costumes/effects that were used for the monsters and such. However, the acting, storyline and just about everything else was a major let down. I gave this movie 2 stars for the simple fact that Shannon Elizabeth was in it (hot), and that some of the costumes were nicely done. Don't waste your money on this one, it's so bad you can even spot camera men and guys who hold the microphone boom in several shots."
2,Watch The Original Instead,"This uninspired remake is terrible. You should buy the original 1960 version instead. Or at least, watch the 1960 version first, then you may like this film somewhat better.There are nifty improvements in this newer version, such as the glass walls and the ghosts being imprisoned in their own rooms...but I still found it FORGETTABLE and TYPICAL..."
1,Is this supposed to be a horror movie?,"There are so many plot holes in this movie. I don't why the lawyer needs to contact the family when his intention is to steal the money in the glass house. That dude has the key, and I lost count the ghosts. Midget ghost, nude ghost, baseball bat ghost.....Do yourself a favour, DON'T WATCH THIS SUCKER!!The only reason I watched the whole movie because I was trying to learn English."
1,Wasted Time,"Worst movie I have seen to date and that is saying a lot since I watched Moulin Rouge. I guess I can say that the scariest part of the movie was the acting. It was atrocious! Obviously no one who took part in the recreation of this film took into consideration the audience. Special effects lacked especially for this day and age. Total movie was not believable, starting with the very beginning. How can you live in a cramped apartment barely making ends meet, but still able to have a Nanny for your son."
1,More annoying than anything else,"If you have already checked out any other reviews for this movie, you have probably already been exposed to the ""but the house was REALLY cool"" comments.Sad to say, the only really cool part of this movie IS the house.The ghosts are not scary and the strobe effect that accompanies them only heightens your desire to turn the movie off.I'll come clean and admit that I have never seen the original; but as far as this bad boy is concerned...I must quote an old friend of mine.""Poop, just poop"".Go watch the remake of House on Haunted Hill again. At least it was a fun movie..up until that stupid ghost pulling the chain ending...but don't get me started.Peace."
3,style over substance,"Was I the only one laughing at the cut-up ghost with breast implants? Aside for that, this whole movie reminded me of a Marilyn Manson video for some reason."
3,Cheesy Wannabe Steampunk,"My fiance wanted to rent this movie because it has an actor he likes in it. The opening is incredibly cheesy and the cheese continues through the rest of the movie. It has a wannabe steampunk vibe but the whole movie was so surreal that I couldn't really get into it. My fiance really liked it, which is why it gets three stars."
2,Not a great story,"Defenitely not. Actors play OK and the directing is fine but the real star is, in fact, the house itself: very imaginative. But that's it."
3,Good at least for what it was. Underrated.,"The plot of this movie and many of the plot elements in it are pretty much patently absurd, although this doesn't make the movie totally horrible. Often movies get a horrible review because they have a thin plot and aren't 'good' in essence.The idea is that the family moves into this house and there are ghosts in it, etc.... The igniting event that sets off the whole plot never really made any sense to me, but past that it's pretty clever. The only fundamental flaws with this movie(implausiblity aside) are that they never really explain how or why the ghosts get released, and secondly, they never explain how the device in the guy's house works and what it's for.Either way, it's a fun movie to watch."
3,Not enough Ghosts?,I was really disapointed in this movie..The story itself was strange and frankly Hokey. The few flashes you get of some pretty disturbing Ghosts...Is not enought to hold your interest. Dont bother..
1,"Burn, Hollywood, Burn","Yikes! What a complete waste of time. The scariest thing about this movie is the knowledge that there are several more bona-fide William Castle classics for these hacks at ""Dark Castle Entertainment"" to butcher. Wrap your short-attention spans around this: The original 13 GHOSTS is available on DVD, and even preserves the gimmick of the ""ghost viewers"" so you can choose whether or not to see the spirits. Knowing that, there is no reason to even see this pitiful new version."
1,What waste of time,"I recently watched this movie and let me save you some time, DON'T see it. It is the classic bore of action horror. A little boy going down into a cellar to check out ghostly screams and whispers. Then running away only to trip and fall. Then to make it worst the kids family SPLITS up to find this kid in the same area. The entire plot is unbelieveable and does the classic (stuff) bad horror movies do. It is not scarry, only aggravating. If I could have given this movie a comparison I would compare it to Attack of the killer tomatoes with better special effects. That is how bad it was."
1,Very Poor Movie,This is without a doubt the worst remake/extension of a former very poor movie at best. Please don't waste your money as i did purchasing this movie in any form. It is neither scary or suspenseful. Rent it first if you must but let buyer beware.
2,Should Have Been Great...,"13 GHOSTS had the potential to be a classic remake of the goofy 50s version. Unfortunately, a cool premise and decent characters are pretty much wasted. The major problem is the pacing. 13G flies by at an insane speed, never really spending enough time on anything. I liked most of the ghosts, but they were reduced to spooky flashes that had no fright-power. The HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake took a zany, old Vincent Price movie and turned it into a modern classic. 13G is absolutely hollow by comparison..."
1,skip this turkey and buy the original,"this remake of the better than ever original is loud,crude,gory,and worst of all DULL!!!!! a waste of time and not one real fright to be had. buy the original instead."
4,"Hammer,Jackal,Pretty Princess and many many more","I liked this movie,it was really good, alot of blood and gore, just pure brilliant gore.Really worth watching."
1,How Many Silica Grains Died to Make This Moovy...?,"...only slightly better than the 60s classic ""The Mask"", (the Wm Castle like one, not the Carrey one) but that moovy had the thrill of 3D scenes which required green and red lensed shades to allow the melting eyeballs and floating skulls to have a truly frightening effect on the audience. This moovy goes for the gross-out. The lawyer 'gets it' the worst...Well, in my opinion, the viewer 'gets it', too. The loss of wallet content from the rental or purchase of this product."
3,WORTH A ONCE OVER,"That is about it for me. The original was more interesting, but I admit the effects were good in this one. It seemed to drag a little. Not one to buy, just watch once or twice."
3,"not bad,not great","this is not the best best horror movie ever made. but at least its not the stupidest either. it has its strong points and its bad points. like for instance the only likable characters are matthew lillard and tony shalhoub. the strong point, is matthew lillard fighting a ghost with a bat and a ghost with a weird head thing who is called the jackel.here the film deminstrates a little suspense as you are concerned for the character. it is kind of scary if your not used to haunted house movies but if you've seen house on haunted hill your probably not even gonna jump more then once. the bad point is that the family[a side from the dad] is stupid and kind of annoying. the kid at least did some dumb things. but if your in the mood for a gore filled ghost flick and you've got nothing else its the perfect solution to bordom at least the first time you see it."
4,Not better than Jeepers Creepers but Damn Good!!!,"I thought this movie causght a lot of the essence of a good horror movie. Its more gory than any 1980's horror movie, its got pretty good acting, the special effects are awesome and gross at the same time, the monsters( ghost i mean) are freakin awesome. This movie delivers on scare value totally. A good flick that could be better. rent it before u buy it!!!"
3,I enjoyed the house,"This movie nabbed me one day on cable, I was half following it while cleaning. I enjoyed teh visuals and concept of the house being made of glass and transparent but other than that the plot was a little thinner than the special effects made it seem like it shoudl be. Lots of interesting concepts of demons/ghosts being trapped in this house by the words on the walls. The house itself being a spell."
5,Ghost13,I really was suprised when i seen the movie. It scaried me out of my skin in the dark. But when he found his kids.
3,3.25 stars for a moderately good job,While this wasn't the most scary or even creepy horror movie i have seen it did manage to have an interesting enough background to keep me glued to the television. The fact that there is more than just one type of bad guy is kind of cool. I really liked the whole puzzle machine concept as well as the twist with the wife/mother at the end. Overall this is definitely worth renting for some late Saturday night popcorn flick.
2,...,"While the idea for this movie may have been intriguing, it needed to be developed more. The story felt slapped together, and I had a hard time maintaining my interest through the film, it was a chore to sit through but I wanted to see how it ended, got dang it! Finally we see the reason for 13 ghosts and why the house is the way it is, but honestly, it was just too unbelievable for me. The only nice thing about the whole movie was the glass house and its creative design."
1,Holy Mother of Merciful (...)!!!,"Dude, that one scene when that lady with the box on her head was all ""WAAAAAAHHHHHH!"" And that chick from American Pie was all ""WAAAAAAHHHHHH!"" And then the taxi driver from Wings was all like ""I gotta find my kid!"" Awesome, dude. But that big fat guy with the midget lady? Man, that was just creepy."
1,THE DVD WAS SCRATCHED AND UNWATCHABLE,"GRANTED I ONLY SPENT 4 DOLLARS, BUT, I SHOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO WATCH THE CRAPPY MOVIE I CHOSE. IF U HAVE A DVD THAT U CAN'T WATCH YOURSELF YOU SHOULDN'T SELL IT TO MAKE A FEW DOLLARS."
1,13 reasons to turn it off...,13 - Monk should stick to Monk12 - The ghosts aren't scary11 - Matthew Lillard is annoying10 - The very first scene says it all (stupid)9 - There are no real jump scenes8 - The script is lame7 - Shannon Elizabeth keeps her top on6 - The cool house isn't really all that cool5 - The acting is atrocious4 - Did I mention that Lillard is annoying?3 - And so is that little kid2 - The premise is retarded1 - You'll regret it if you don't!
2,What???,"Misses the mark. A great idea bogged down by a bad film. This had so much potential, but the execution was just sad and borderline pathetic. If it hadn't been for the the enjoyable death of the attorney, I'd have given this just one star. The ""ghosts"" were fun to watch, as well as well thought out. Too bad they were not better developed as true ""characters"" in the film. The ""real"" characters were shallow and uninteresting. The only one we cared about (the psychic) was underutilized. Overall, a waste of time."
4,"Great movie! Unfortunately, not scary.","This is a great movie. It's not scary though, but the plot is amazing. I hear that it's a remake to an older version, I haven't seen that one, but I might want to. You should probably rent this movie before buying it, how everybody else's reviews are all over the place. You'll have to see it for yourself."
5,13 LUCKY OR UNLUCKY?!,"personally this movie was excellent. i really enjoyed it, and have watched it many many times. the story is good, the actors did very well, and the ghost were perfect. i loved all the 13 characters, the whole concept. it was very entertaining, and a little creepy. the stories behind these characters were just as fascinating. the evil man keeping these tortured souls for his own selfish purpose. the whole glasss house, all see through, the cellar full of ghosts, the unknowing family, the whole glasses idea, it was just great. all the makeup i really thought it was very well done, and matthew lillard was good as a paranoid psychic, but i did not like he's ending. the extras on here, were just as good. overall the whole movie was A+. then the twist in the end, was indeed a twist. very much a pleaser."
3,EERIE,"THIS MOVIE ISN'T AS BAD AS YOU'VE HEARD, IT'S FAIR. WHEN THE SCREENPLAY EXPLAINS THE GHOSTS AND HOW THEY WERE CHOSEN, THE MOVIE BECOMES VERY EERIE. THE SET DESIGNS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THE COMPUTER EFFECTS ARE AMAZING AND THE MAKE UP EFFECTS ARE TOP NOTCH. THERE ARE SOME VERY COOL LOOKING GHOST. THE MOVIE HAS AN UNSETTLING CREEPINESS TO IT, WHICH MEANS THERE IS OBVIOSLY SOMETHING THERE.A FAMILY OF 3 + THEIR HOUSEKEEPER INHERIT A MANSION, THE INTER WALLS ARE MADE OF GLASS, AND OF COURSE THE HOUSE IS HAUNTED. LEFT TO THEM BY A GHOST HUNTING RELATIVE THAT WAS KILLED (MAYBE NOT) ON THE JOB. THE HOUSE HOLDS 12 GHOSTS WHILE THE 13TH IS YET TO DIE. WHO WILL IT BE? TO FIND OUT, WATCH THE MOVIE."
3,Decent for a remake.,"I am probably a good critic for remakes because I have reached an age where I have seen all the originals. I saw the original Thirteen Ghosts when I was younger and I remember I was under my seat. I am from a simpler world and the remake surely would have traumatized me then, but like many other remakes I see on video today, they try to cram too much technology into ninety minutes. The scenes are ""busy"" and they tend to run together in the mind. I remember being able to sort out action in older horror movies and point to the ""scary parts"" when reviewing. The new Thirteen Ghosts was good, but a little overwhelming. A little suspense is just as good as state of the arts technology. Sometimes it works better to create a true classic horror movie. The ""Haunting"", both versions, the new and remake are an example of a good transition in generations of film making."
3,"A halloween film, not much charecter devel.","I enjoyed the movie, but I wouldn't care to own it. I was in the mood for a good halloween movie and this hit the spot. The house was ver interesting. I liked the ideas for the spells and such. The special effects were great in some parts, poor in others. I wasn't a big fan of the jerky sped-up scenes where the ghosts were chasing the charecters. It just seemed poorly done. A few times you could tell where a portion was cut out of the movie, like a bad transition from one part to another.. like in a book ending a chapter and staring a new one mid sentence. Some of the charecter development was rather weak. Especially the ""ghost freedom fighter"" girl. The scene towards the end when the main charecter figures out the truth about the bad guy was a little lame. All in all I guess you can criticize every film even if you enjoyed it or not and i did enjoy this one. Just don't expect it to be an earth shattering theatrical or eye dazzling film."
4,12 Awesome Ghosts,"I saw this movie at a matinee on Halloween. This movie is good just for the ghosts. The Ghost makeup was excellent and the ghosts were scary and freaky. While the ending of the movie left me wanting more and was anti-climatic i felt it was worth it just for the ghosts. They used some good cinematography of the house added with some creepy music and long drawn camera shots (ala Halloween) but this movie isn't as scary, or gory as the trailers and commericals say. The ghosts are the best part of this movie and for once i actually like Lillard in a movie, his character was actually pretty cool. The Princess ghost is just too cool and too freaky, the juggernaut is another excellent ghost. Go see the movie for the ghosts and don't get your hopes up too high and you'll like this movie, i think."
1,This Is one of THE WORST Movies I Have EVER seen,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am a huge HORROR movie fan. There is no sympathy for any of the victims/characters whatsoever, as they are all rather unlikeable. A total waste of time and money (unfortunately I bought the darn thing) Rent it first if you feel you must, but trust me on this one. BAD, BAD, BAD! It doesn't even deserve ONE star."
4,Suspense and horror done well,"There are certain criteria in every horror movie that need to be met in order for it to be a good horror movie.1. Recycled plot2. Gore3. Campy dialogue4. No long lingering looks at the bad guy5. The ever popular don't go in there sceneThis is why Thirteen Ghosts in my opinion far exceeded the cirtically acclaimed Jeepers Creepers. In this movie the spirits trapped in the basement are given just enough screen time to be identified, yet we are not allowed to sit and study them. I was made to jump many times durring this movie, and loved every minute of it. It's sad that it didn't do as well as the dissapointing Jeepers Creepers."
1,One of the Worse Horror Movies Ever Made,"This movie isn't just lousy...anybody with no budget and a couple of drunk buddies can make a lousy horror flick.This movie is INSULTING. Though an obviously large amount of cash was thrown at this project, the dialogue is IDIOTIC at best, the jokes are unfunny, and the premise is ridiculous.You know how frustrating it is to see unbelievably dumb characters say and do unbelievable dumb things in horror flicks? All the while spouting innane one-liners? Well, this movie re-wrote the book on all of that. You'll be BEGGING the monsters to kill these idiots."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"A complete labyrinth of confusion, I could not explain what this movie was supposed to be about in a gazillion years. There's a family whose mom gets burnt in a fire and they are left a house by a rich uncle. Easy enough, but then the house is not really a house at all, more like a maze, surrounded by nothing but glass, glass walls inside and outside, corridors leading nowhere, strange combinations and sequences of events lead to... well, nothing actually. Not only was it really stupid, it was pointless. At least, if there was a point or a plot or a theme or a message, it was hidden very well under a haze of badly put together scenes. Too bad, I was really looking forward to a good horror flick. If you are looking forward to a new adventure in horror, don't bother with this one."
3,Black Zodiac,"This movie is not all that bad. Better than Castle's old boring one from the 60's.There is some creepiness to the movie,and some twisted history as well! Each ghosts has a story that if you do some research is true! Like Jackel,in the 1800's in England was a crazed man named ""Caged Jakel"".This movie also twists the whole astrology and 13 signs movement.What I also didn't like was Rah Diggas sterotypical role of a nanny to a poor white family.The gore is excellent with blood and guts gallore! And the house or should I save ""living astrochart/glass maze"",was just amazing.The acting was standdard,and at times too characterized,and the ghosts needed more plot. Like another poster stated ""the history of the ghosts is scary than the movie itself"".Since Holloween is near,why not spin this DVD at a party along with THE RING?Ghoulish fun for all!"
3,Getting There,"Ok, so the advent of remakes is on it's way and where itends, who can say? If you grew up with William Castle,lived through the Slasher movies and find yourself stagger-ing through the over-indulgent CGI-effects movies and wonderwhere the good old creepy feeling went...well, 13 Ghost getsya closer than most.The CGI effect are masterfully blending with existing setsand you'll find it hard to tell where it ends or begins.The whole aspect of the house was unique and it is a 'mustsee' just for the house itself. My only gripe is theline-up of the Ghost, I really dug the Jackel and thoughtthat he was a lot more threatening than the Heavy MetalSpike-Head, and the Lurch/serial killer-Juggernaut...butmy favorite was the Beauty with the knife...She needs tobe seen, and is pretty creepy. The Gore is a little toohigh, but at least the CGI was'nt there to replace theattitude!Keith (can't wait for them to do Macabre!)"
2,Pathetic remake based loosely on the original!,"The newest movie to get a bad remake is ""13 Ghosts"". It's based loosely on the original William Castle movie made in the 1960's-1950. Other than that that just about all it shares in common with the original. If you like the other William Castle remake of ""House on Haunted Hill""(another remake that did not to be done, you might like this. This movie is a mess, with too many plot holes. too many special effects etc.. Also why could'nt people watching the movie wear special glasses like they did with the original movie? Having the actors wear them was pretty lame.If you like any of the movie stars fine but I'd rate it as one of 2001's worst movies! I wonder why Matthew Lillard was in this movie? Maybe he has a contract with Warner Brothers?As for me, I wish I spent the movie I used watching this trash and bought the original on DVD. Please Hollywood stop remaking classic movies and just release the original movie instead!"
1,And I though that the re-make of 'House On Haunted Hill' was bad!,This was worse then the re-make of 'House On Haunted Hill'!Why...?!1. The whole pace of the movie and chain of eventsin this movie were exactly the same as they were in'House On Haunted Hill'!2. It was another gore-fest!3. The actors were not that good!4. It would have been better if we learned moreabout each of the ghosts and where they came from...5. Again the movie does not deliver one good 'BOO'!Again it was another gore-fest that didn't seem to have much of apoint to it...!My grade: F or one star!
2,Unlucky Ghosts,"In theory, Thirteen Ghosts should be an excellent movie of the macabre. You have the hideous ghosts, a supposedly suspensful plot, it should work out but its doesn't. Why? The charcters!To make a long story short, I never seen such an aggravating, dysfunctional group of people in my life! The kids drive you nuts, the adults get on your nerves, if you are not careful you actualy start rooting for the ghosts (who, when you get right down to it, have a good reason for being upset!).Where's Dark Shadows when you need it?"
2,The F/X scared me...,"Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is an adventurer and collector who dies under paranormal circumstances. His nephew Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a recent widower, becomes the heir to his considerable fortune, which includes an amazing house. This wealth emerges in a very suitable moment, since Arthur is struggling financially with two children. However, the house has a terrifying secret that is waiting to be released upon the arriving relatives. Beck uses superb special effects that produce true fear, but they are not balanced with the story leading to an awkward cinematic experience."
5,"Seen this so many times, thought it was time to buy it","This movie has so many wonderful ghosts with their own stories, nothing is more fascinating or interesting than a horror story with a good back story for the villains. I've seen this movie over 10x's."
2,"Plenty of gadgetry, not enough plot lucidity or likeability","This seemed to start of with a promising cast and setting. But too soon the plot started going essentially nowhere fast, so sitting through the muddled playing out of the premise wasn't a very fun night at the movies. You'd have to really be into the cast, the mood, the special effects and the gadgetry to make this worth seeing. If not, see LARA CROFT, TOMB RAIDER instead. The latter is not quite a classic, but at least combines similar gadgetry with at bit more lucidity and palatability in its plot."
2,Extras Better Than The Movie,"The extras on this DVD are better than the movie itself- a bunch of annoying characters- specially the irritating child actor who shall remamin nameless- are trapped in an elaborate haunted house which seems to have been inspired by the ""Hellraiser"" puzzle box. The ghost and the house are imaginative and the behind the scenes features go into their creation. Watch them if you want to but skip this movie"
3,13 ghosts,This was a good movie...Not as good as jeepers creepers but very good...the acting was decent..Shannon Elizabeth was great as always...if nothing else the movie was worth it just for her...the Special effects of this movie was very cool...The house made of glass..Not something you see alot so that made it good and the ghosts were well done...It made you jump and give you chills in some parts...It was a good movie..the dvd is good..not great..they left some things out that could have been put in...but overall it was good...this is a 3 star movie....worth watching...and buying if you like thriller horror movies...
2,"Nice effects, production design, that's about it.","Tony Shalhoub is a widower who inherits a giant, glass house from his recently deceased Uncle. Everything's great for him and his family, except the place is inhabited by ghosts! Dark Castle's second haunted house thriller features some very gruesome ghosts (particularly Shawna Loyer as the Angry Princess), a neat sliced-in-half gore effect, and an energetic performance from Matthew Lillard, but this movie isn't nearly as enjoyable as its previous venture (House on Haunted Hill), thanks to Steve Beck's unbelievably headache-inducing direction, a silly plot that actually ""borrows"" scenes straight from Blade and Casper(!), and the utter predictability and sickeningly sappy ""love conquers all"" theme."
3,Jerky Ghosts Rawk.,"Overall a very good movie. By far some of the best horror popped out of Hollywood anytime recently. The only real complaint I have about it is that stupid little Ghost Hunter chick...she filled no purpose whatsoever.Special effects were all around great. The Jerky ghost action has been in use since Jacob's Ladder made it popular, and it looks like it's seriously here to stay since House on Haunted Hill and it's time lapse/speed photography and now 13 Ghosts...I'd much rather see this than a certain stupid glasses wearing kid who wants to name Cerebus Fluffy. Or the Scream-(...), the downfall of Wes Craven.. See it. Own it. Watch it."
1,Save your money!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Paper thin plot, bad acting, bad script, bad direction."
2,Ho-Hum,"How can I put this...Oh yeah don't waste your money!What you can expect from this movie is the same thing you expect out of most horror films...a big yawn! I love to watch a truly scary movie and ghost just happen to be my favorite scary topic; but this movie just didn't cut it. If anything it made me wish I hadn't eaten my dinner before I went. I will admit that the movie did get a rise out of me once, but in general I slept pretty well that night...trust me that's not a good sign!If you are looking for a truly scary ghost story I would recommend you see ""The other"" staring Nicole Kidman."
3,Entertaining and spooky.,"This movie has it's moments, it is spooky and keeps you on your toes. The house is really wierd and somewhat over the top. Overall it is not bad but not great either."
3,Good til the end,"This movie kept my interest and made me slightly on the creeped side until the ending. Shannon Elizabeth was actually good acting-wise though it may disappoint some of you that she keeps her clothes on the whole time. The other actors did an amiable job with the exception of the lawyer who just seemed to half act. The ending though is really corny and really foreseeable and lacks the suspense of the rest of the film. Solid, but misses the mark."
2,Creepy but trashy!,"This is a 100% typical Hollywood scary movie and has almost the same technical structure as ""The House On Haunted Hill"". The only big difference besides the plot is that ""13 Ghosts"" has contents the more expensive visual effects and with Shannon Elizabeth something nice to be focused on..."
3,"scary ghosts, weak characters-except Matthew Lillard!!!","Thirteen Ghosts was overall a good movie. I saw it twice and I was still scared to go in the bathroom. (...Angry Princess!!) Although some scenes with the family are really lame and the acting reaked (eh-hem!Shannon Elizabeth)- Matthew Lillard delivered throughout the movie for our viewing pleasure!!I love how he would get those seizures or spasms- cuz it really looked like he was getting them whenever he came within 10 ft. of something dead! Plus the spit string and stain on his orange suit added to the effect! Along with his witty, sarcasm and expressive faces- (too bad he wasn't in the whole movie!) The ghosts are scary looking tho- especially the jackal and the angry princess. I haven't read the book, but heard it was better by several. Oh, well- Matthew Lillard still made the movie worth seeing!!!!!!!!!! ^_^"
3,Thirteen Ghosts,"I think that this movie was overall a good movie, but not a great movie. The special effects were really good and made the movie believable. The acting wasn't that great, but I did enjoy Matthew Lillard's performance. This was a great scary movie that leaves you thinking. Overall it is a good movie."
5,13 GHOSTS,"13 GHOSTS is a high-voltage combination of horror, suspense, action, and humor. A man, his daughter, his son, and his maid inherit a house from his uncle Cyrus. The house is actually a gateway that was built in order to open a door to the underworld, and in the basement of the house are containment cages that hold 12 ghosts that will destroy anyone in there path. When the family enters the house, they become trapped inside with the dead spirits, and now with the help of a psychic and a ghost hunter, the family must try to find a way out."
3,...NOT scary...,"This is just a typical movie with tons of gore and violent scenes. Is it scary? No. Is it violent? YES.Unfortunately though, this movie is also plagued with pathetic actions; the group, being chased by 12 'ghosts' split up and do pathetic things.Acting is decent, and the special effects are nicely done (if you can stand to look at REALLY gory stuff.)The addition of the family - ghost relationship is the only remarkable thing about this film."
3,Not amazing,"The disk was fine and the case was OK but it was sent to me with a sticker directly on the cardboard of the case which left sticky residue behind when I took it off. The shipping was not as fast as I would've liked but overall it wasn't bad, but not amazing service."
1,"Stupid, boring and annoying","Very big dissapointment this was. Now, the ghosts were well-done but poorly used. The sound effects were so irritating (every-time a ghost appears we get the same noise), the acting was terrible (Matthew Lillard is such a hack) and the story was really dumb and boring. Potentially this could have been a good film with some decent acting, tension, build-up, writing, directing, etc!How many times do I have to watch a friggen pair of glasses fall onto the floor?God this was as boring as an hour in church. Yawnfest."
2,13 Ghosts................,"So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie."
3,Fun Movie,"A typical horror movie chalked full of ghosts and guels, 13 Ghosts is an enjoyable monster movie with cool special effects and the commonplace uneffective understory. The real stars are the ghosts, which are very well done.The DVD is boreing to an extent and takes from the buying incentive. A decent buy, but only for horror fans."
2,I didnt like it..much,"It starts of with a weird guy using a psychic to capture ghosts. Sadly he dies. his relitives inherit his house, but in it are the 12 ghosts he has already captured. These ghosts are evil, and are roaming the house looking for things to kill. The people are trapped in house with ghosts.Ok..I didnt like it..the old version of it was better, lamer and funnier."
1,Ugly Mess,"This is without qualification one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It isn't even redeemably laughable. It is confused and difficult to follow. Even Tony Shalhoub, who has more than proved himself in previous efforts, and in his TV series, can't help this mess. The only gory or ghastly thing about it is how mangled it has left William Castle's wonderful film, upon which it is based.See the William Castle film instead. It's not very frightening, but it is creepy, and will make you feel like a kid at Halloween."
1,13 Yawns!,"This movie was terrible and should be named 13 Yawns. The acting was poor and without substance. Not one person did a good job acting their part.From the beginning this movie should have been made for the Sci-Fi channel and not the big screen. I forced myself to watch the entire movie to see if it would have any good scenes, but it failed to deliver one.However, the ghosts were made up very well."
1,There are no more good horror films any more.,"This film is sooooooooo dull. Bad acting, a so-so story, and not very gory and scary as the cover makes it look. The FX are the only good things in this film."
1,Worthless remake of a fun cult film from the 60's,"This movies was a complete waste of time. Do yourself a favor,avoid this ...remake and try to find the original(made in 1960 i believe). I like F. Murray Abraham but I sure would like to know how the producer's got him to do this [movie]. To sum it up,""beware the buyer"""
4,Kick ass Movie!,"This movie was the best one of the year 2001! It deserves 5 stars all the way! Matthew Lillard gave a kick ass performance along with Shannon Elizabeth,and Tony Shalhoub.This movie gave thrills and chills the whole way through. I would watch this movie for your first horror!"
3,"visually stunning, but the plot is well...","What 13 ghosts lacks in plot, it makes up for in eerie images, scary ghosts, and creative death sequences. Matthew Lillard (from SCREAM), plays a man who gets bad headaches whenever he comes near anything dead. Which is why F. Murray Abraham uses him to capture ghosts. Why is he capturing ghosts? Who knows? Who cares? With chills aplenty, this film quickly loses its thin plotline and lets the ghosts run amuck. (THANK GOD) Even when we find out the point of capturing the ghosts, we don't care because it sounds so stupid. There are a couple of plot twists that make this average horror movie try to attain something more, that only sometime succeed. If you like gory visual effects you should like this, but don't look for a plot. An enjoyable visual ride just perfect for Halloween. If it came out at any other time of year, my review would be a bit more harsh."
1,Should've been called Thirteen HOURS...,"... because that's how long it'll feel like as you wait for this boring, convoluted, brain-dead piece of (...) to end! Scary? Yeah, right. It's not even a horror movie. Just a bunch of special effects injected around a nonsense plot. The farther the movie progresses (regresses) the worse the story gets and the special effects are just flashbulb-popping botch jobs that'd induce an epileptic into seizures.Bet you didn't know this was produced by tinseltown heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, did you? Notice they're doing everything they can to disassociate themselves from this garbage.Hollywood produced some real (...) this year, but even Bones was at least a watchable movie until it's ridiculous ending. This movie is just awful from beginning to end. Thir13en Ghosts (even the name is stupid) gets my vote as the worst movie of 2001 - and one of the worst movies ever made."
3,A Decent Time-Killer,"The guys who grossed everybody out with HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL are back to serve seconds with THIRTEEN GHOSTS, and again the blood and guts is hiked up from that of the original. The most interesting thing about the movie is the ""haunted""house, which is actually a house comprised of glass. It's the film's best special effect, outclassing the acting and ample gore found thoughout. Of course horror films aren't about the acting, which makes the presence of first rate actors such as Tony Shalhoub and Embeth Davidtz seem like the producers were at least trying. Davidtz is the ghostbuster trying to free the ""thirteen ghosts"" trapped within the confines of the glass house, which has been inherited by Shalhoub's character. He precedes to move in his family, and of course that's where the spookiness begins. All in all, it's an entertaining waste of time, and far better than the savage reviews critics are giving it."
3,Unworthy Remake,"In the 60's, William Castle released the original ""13 Ghosts"", a movie which has just about everything going for it.Why oh why couldn't they leave well enough alone?Ok, I'll give you that the House is a cool environment, but unfortunately, it's the only cool thing in the movie. The high-impact-acrylic ghost viewers are, well, boring.F. Murray Abraham is wasted on this. He is given little else to do but show up and grimace. What a far cry from Geoffery Rush's performance in the nearly creditable remake of House on Haunted Hill. Rush was a delight, Abraham barely registers. Save your time and money -- see the original in it's Illusion-O DVD version! I was so disappointed. I really WANTED this to be good, but I fell asleep. I'm giving it 3 stars only because of the art direction. Maybe somebody can take the concept and make a halloween haunted house out of it next year, but other than that this is a film best forgotten."
2,Scare you back all the way to the ticket counter...,"Scares you back all the way to the ticket counter, to get your money back. Lack of plot and acting skills make the movie a rollercoaster of gore. Not interesting enough to even try to understand what the goal of the movie is. About the only thing holding this movie together is the makeup on the 'traditional' monsters."
2,he hates HK cinema!,"at a glance this book seems like a treasure for those who love HK movies and want a handy reference. But once you start reading his reviews, you realize that despite his opening claim that he actually loves these movies---he hates them. He's analyzing them like they're supposed to be the next James Joyce of films, but most HK movies are high octane fun. Start looking at the logic of things and these movies tend to fall apart (as do most all movies).He loses the sheer exhilaration of the viewer.So please, someone out there who actually loves these films---put together a comprehensive plot/review of HK films."
5,Great sounds - Makes you feel like they were there with you!,"Once again the World Wrestling Federation bring the fans the cool sounds of their favorite or least favorite WWF Superstar. Vol. 3 is packed with the themes of the hottest performers in the industry today!Chills run down your spine as The Undertaker's theme permeates your skin...and just when you think the chill has left you the electrifying theme of The Brood and Kane gets the chill right back. However, you wanna get your juicing flowing then the melodic sounds of D-Generation X, X-Pac or the most ""over"" tag team in the worllldddd, the New Age Outlaws will make you wanna dance and scream!The one down note on the whole album is Dude Love's theme. We could have done without it. Mankind would have been a great alternative.All in all, the WWF does what it has always has done for the fans.. deliver Quality!!!I, for one, ""Get it!!"""
5,Great CD if you can find it.,"This was released in Maryland on 1-5-99. A friend of mine got one. It is great, except for Dude Love and Sable. These songs were on the last CD and did not deserve a replay on the third Cd. Anyway, this CD must be #1 on the charts because I cannot find it anywhere!!!!"
5,A must have for any WWF fan,"It doesn't get any bigger or better than the WWF and WWF The Music Volume 3 is no exception. All the top WWF superstar's music is here. The Rock, Steve Austin, Undertaker, DX, Gangrel, and 9 more excellent tracks. Buy this one. It's worth every penny"
1,This was a horrible CD,This had songs that got boring after the first time you heard it.Don't buy it it's horrible
3,A poor WWE CD release,"Volume 3 is lack lustre, the only theme songs worth listening to is Edge, Kane, Ken Shamrock and Stone Cold's theme songs. The rest are a miss. Volume 4 and 5 were much better. This CD is only for WWE fans. I doubt that non wrestling fans would like this CD at all.In short, this CD could of been compiled better."
3,WWF Volume 3 is not a bad Cd,"Heres my rating on the CD1. Undertaker - Ok theme2. Edge - One of the coolest3. X-Pac - Great lyrics4. Dude Love - A little OK5. Kane - The Intro is great but the rest of the song is boring6. The Rock - Same Boring Lyrics but ok beat7. Gangrel - The best on the CD8. Ken Shamrock - Good intro but music is no different than on Volume 29. Oddities - Horrible Beat but good lyrics10. D-Generation X - The 2nd Best song on the CD11. Sable - Sounds just like the one on Volume 212. New Age Outlaws - Barely any lyrics but a good beat13. Val Venis - Good back in its time14. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Current theme, good"
5,BAH,This CD was one of the best CD's I've ever gotten. My favorite track is the Oddities. I think that all the tracks are pretty good. The only track that really sucks is probably Edge. All the other tracks on the CD are great. The songs are just great and the CD definatly deserves a 5.
3,"A fairly good cd, some good songs, some bad ones","WWF: The Music Vol. 3 was pretty good. However, the WWF could've picked some better themes... Rating of the tracks: 1. Undertaker: An Awesome theme. That's all I have to say about it. 2. Edge: Decent, but not something I can listen to too much 3. X-Pac: Pretty good, except there could've been more verses 4. Dude Love: Depends if you like disco... 5. Kane: A good theme 6. The Rock: I don't like this theme. This was his Nation Theme, not Corporate 7. Brood: Another superb theme. The beat's good, plus the music 8. Shamrock: Pitiful. Just Pitiful 9. Oddities: Excellent theme made by The Insane Clown Posse 10. DX: One of the best themes ever! 11. Sable: Even worse than Shamrock's 12. New Age Outlaws: Oh you didn't know?! This theme is alright 13. Val Venis: Not good or Bad 14. Steve Austin: Ok theme, I've heard better though"
1,Hated it!!!!,this is horrible who would want to listen to enterance music all day? i love wrestling but there is no way i would buy this garbage. I only have two words for this cd: Gar bage.
1,It is terrible,This album sucked badly. I don't understand why people love seeing guys in tights hitting each other. It is terrible how people could actually spend money on this album
5,A musical experince of wrestling!,I purchased this cd through the WWF Shopzone. I got it through express mail. I couldn't wait to pop it in my cd player and listen. I was suprised at the quality of the music. The music is the best quality of your favorite wrestlers entrance music. Order yours today!
5,Awsome!!!,"The addition of the new Undertaker theme along with Val Venis, The New Age Outlaws, The Oddities, X-Pac and the Degeneration X theme is totaly the album."
5,cool cd,this is the best cd ever made in music history.period. now to the inbreed hillbilly from burlington on february : you are really dumb.first of all todays wrestling isnt men in tights grabbing each other it is the best damn sport ever so go home and listen to your country music
5,Best wrestling cd out today.,"I think that it all great songs on it and the lyrics are just like o WWF, which makes even better. I gave it 5 stars because its got all the music that a true fan of the WWF would like. One difference that I like about the two cds is that the 3rd volume doesn't have as much commentary."
4,WWF THE MUSIC ..VOL.3 ...ROCKS,"AS A AVID WRESTLING FAN , I ENJOY THE ENTRANCE THEMES ON THIS CD ...THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THE DISC IS THAT MARC MERO'S ENTRANCE THEME WAS NOT INCLUDED ."
5,"THE Best CD EVER Put Together, Period.","This is, without a doubt, the best album by ANY artist on ANY label EVER put out. As of the writing of this review, it had soared to number 15 on the Billboard Music Charts. That just shows you how butt-kicking awesome it is! I have to admit, I thought Album 2 could have been done a little better. But this one rocked Razor's world, baby! Buy it, NOW! Or I'll burn your house down, little man!"
4,Great for all WWF watchers!!!,"I got this cd almost as soon as it came out.I really like it.The only problem is that it is not actuall songs.Some tracks you only feel like listening to for a few seconds.As a personal recomendation, my favroite track is track #7:Gangrel/Brood wich I am now listening to as you read this/as I typed this.It has a really good beat to it.This song is the reason I decied to follow the Brood.But all other tracks are great.""Stone Cold"" and his theme seemed to pump me up when I listen to it.When the New Age Outlaws plays I can do my own routine like they would do.Overall I think it is a really good cd. From track#1 till track#14 you'll want to listen to all of these song.Unfortunatlly so will your friends.So tell them to by they're own copy here also at amazon.com.If you are looking to see what other people tought of the cd so you know if you should buy it I got just 2 words for ya:BUY IT!!!"
5,Volume 3 will keep you rockin'!,"This CD kicks so much *** it just isn't funny. If you're a WWF fan, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD. If you aren't, buy it anyway. This CD finally got rid of the infernal talking! The only talkin' I hear is the famous ""Oh, you didn't know?"" The bottom line is, if you haven't gotten this CD yet, ""you better call somebody!"""
4,WWF Music Volume 3,"This album contains a compilation of various themes from WWF Superstars. From Stone Cold to Val Venis. No matter what your preference, your bound to find a tune on this cd that cures your ills. This is a great cd for any fans of Wrestling and even those that arnt."
3,You know what I allow you to know.,"This was the third volume of WWF Superstars ""original arena enterance theme songs"". Yes, the music that plays while wrestlers enter the ring. The music was written by Jimmy Johnston, with the exception of the ""Oddities"" theme, which is by The Insane Clown Posse. Most of this music is pretty repetitive, with the same riff being repeated over and over for three to four minutes. Which is not to say it's not enjoyable, if you were a wrestling fan in the late 1990s. Jimmy Johnston is the best composer of wrestler entrance themes of all time, for what it's worth."
2,"Waste of Money, Overpriced.",How can you listen to repetitions of jingles all day? This should have cost five bucks. It is way overpriced. It is for people taht wrestle and want to act like wrasslers.
5,DEEZ NUUTS!!,"This album was great!! The Rock, D-X, NAO, even Dude Love's was funny!! No Master P, but no cd is perfect. Master B says: ""If you're hatin on this tape then you better check yourself into the Smack-Down Hotel, jabroni!!"""
4,It's CDs like this that have WCW quaking in their boots!,"The newest set to the WWF Music Collection has 14 tracks of various WWF superstars. I was very impressed with the set this time around. They really got to the point with this one:Just themes, no commentary. But, if something did have to be changed, it would be Dude Love. Replace that with either Mankind's first entrance music or his current one. Maybe something with the Oddities, too. But, it's a great compilation, and any WWF fan that doesn't own this is probably on crack or something...."
