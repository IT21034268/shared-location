2,NOT PLEASED,"I got tired of the tapes wearing out of my old answering machine, but this answering machine after a few months' use, would cut off my greeting and disconnect, making people have to call two or three times.I think I'll stick to the tape machines. Mine was reliable as long as the tape lasted."
4,GE 29869E2 DIGITAL ANSWERING MACHINE,Great machine!!!!!!!!!!! Sound quality is excellent. Wonderful price and with the battery backup I never need worry about resetting or losing messages. I am delighted.Carol F.
5,Digital Answering Machine,"This is strictly an answering machine. I have had a couple of cordless phone/answering machine combos, and they don't work for very long. I specifically wanted one without a phone this time. The batteries go bad on the cordless phones pretty quickly and never quite work correctly again after you replace the battery."
4,"Great sound quality and features, bad interface","The sound quality is very high on this unit. It has a great deal of memory, so it can hold many messages. I'm happy with it so far. The only drawback is the poor user interface. For example, you cannot delete a message until you have listened to all of it, and you can't fast forward, so several times I've had to sit through four minutes of fax machine beeping or telemarketer pitches before removing the message. It also present much of the information in the reverse order of how it would be most useful, like it doesn't tell you the time/date stamp until after you've heard the message."
4,Plays for the Theatre,"Book in fair condition. It wasn't really bad but not fantastic or horrible condition. The book looked like your average wear and tear book, not unusable though. Shipper did great sending book in a reasonable amount of time. No complaints."
1,What happened to the formula?,"I don't know what happened. I used samples of this product last yr. and liked it tremendously. I just recently bought the regular size of this product and used it for 2 weeks and it dried out my skin, it also made my skin peel and feel very tight. They had to of changed the formula. These are not the same ingredients I used when I bought the sample package last yr. Needless to say I am returning this product along with the Supreme Polypeptide and Pumpkin Renew which also dried out my face, made it peel, and broke me out. I am 49 yrs. old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products. Now my skin is very much off balance."
3,too heavy,Maybe I don't have dry enough skin to appreciate the deep repair creme. Its really thick. Sorry to say its been reduced to hand creame..and it does nicely at that. no repeat buys for me.
1,My face is bright red!,"Let me start off by saying that I've used other MyChelle products and been happy with them... so I don't know what happened with this product. Less than five minutes after I put it on, my face was starting to feel a little tingly but nothing uncomfortable. I went into the bathroom and much to my horror... my face was bright red. I look like I have a terrible sunburn! Stay away from this if you have extra-sensitive skin like I do."
2,"Changed Packaging, Changed Formula?","I have been a devotee of this product for several years now. Wasn't the least bit worried when I saw the new packaging because I was sure the formula hadn't changed. However, what was in that jar was not the same thing I have been using all this while. The Deep Repair Cream used to make my skin feel enveloped in moisture, but not heavy, just beautifully, perfectly moisturized. With this jar, I felt like I needed two applications in order to keep my skin from feeling dried out. The conditions in my apartment have actually gotten less dry lately since the heat has been on less with the warmer, more humid weather. While the old formula used to be super concentrated and I could use very little and feel completely moisturized, I went through this jar in twice the time, so its just not worth the money to me. Changed to a different organic brand that my esthetician recommended, and it works the way Deep Repair should. Too bad, I really like this company."
1,DON'T BUY!,"I am an avid zombie novel reader, so I was excited to get started on reading this one when it came in the mail. I forced myself to finish it, because I apparently hate myself. The author tries to be clever and unique by bolding the words, sigh and end on each page, linking it to the title of the novel. He also uses one phrase repeatedly (approximately every 1-2 pages), which isn't even a good phrase and becomes quite annoying.There are numerous grammar and spelling errors, which are clearly mistakes and not some original use of the English language. The plot could have used some work. If you want a good novel about changing time continuums, then read The Time Machine. Don't waste your time reading this one. Save your money. Buy something else.Every Sigh, the End: A Novel About Zombies"
2,disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this, but about 1/3 into the book (still no zombies) I had to force myself to finish. The main plot was a really good idea, about a zombie reality TV show and the millennium, but it had too many jumps and flashbacks that talked about nothing and didn't hold my attention. It is also one of the few books where I wanted to see the main character, Ross, get killed so he would quit whining. And the time travel/astral projection sub-plot?!?! I won't even comment on that one."
2,Zombies+ Bret Easton Ellis = this book,I can't believe that someone has not noticed the similarities in these books. My guess is that there aren't too many zombie novel readers that have read much of Ellis' work. Give them a read and tell me that I'm crazy.
2,do what now?,"im not sure what this book is about, there was some zombies, and the fox network, the guys from x files maybe space aliens? its a keeper but back shelf i will not re read it"
2,Confusing and not really about zombies,"Avoid this novel if you are looking for a book about zombies. The writing tries to be way too clever for its own good and fails miserably. The plot is often confusing and the zombies don't appear for a long time, and when they do it doesn't make any sense at all."
1,Wasted Money,"Written in a format that I feel was an attempt to be original and clever, but reads worse that chinese stero instructions, just as frustrating and overall, I feel was likely and attempt by the author to impress himslef with his unique vision and story telling ability. I threw it away."
4,Fast service and as advertised.,"This was a solid zombie book. The text is a little difficult to follow at the beginning and some of the situations seem a bit juvenile, but that is what I expect from a zombie novel."
3,Medium-rare,"Not sure who this book is intended for; neither graphic designers or web-heads are particularly well served. It's like a 101 of CSS by an inexpierenced teacher - whilst having lots of good grounding information it jumps around a bit. The recommendation of Jeffrey Zeldman himself made me grab a copy hot off the press; and if this is the best there is: that's a shame. Unfortunatly placed somewhere between a book for designers and geeks it doesn't satisfy on either count. Also it contains too many little errors. Its does have a nice feel to it thought - the writer's style is easy, which helps get through the code. A good grounding but not so easy to get through - wait for a second edition or buy second hand."
3,"Good Book, Not Great Book","This book was a requirement for an HTML/CSS class I took last semester. The book was informative, but the way the information was presented was not helpful at times.I found myself reading over things several times to get them to stick in my head. I have used other web language learning books with MUCH better presentation that made them more enjoyable to read and much easier to retain than this particular book."
1,Very hard to understand,I got this book because it is required for my internet class. I have read through it and it is very hard to follow. The way the examples are shown just makes following them harder. I have been going to collage for three years and this has got to be one of the hardest books I have had to use.
2,lightweight css,"They obviously spent a lot of money publishing the book - paper quality, color, etc. Unfortunately the content doesn't live up to the wrapper. It's a light overview of css, with only basic examples. Disappointed for the money."
5,Great book!,"I have seveal books on CSS but this one is my favotire. Great for the novice or for someone like me who is somewhat experienced. I wanted to convert a few sites to use CSS, and was able to do everything with help from this book. The author explains CSS very well."
4,"Looks like an eye-candy book, yet serves as a reference","This book is easy to read and the pages have color throughout. There is a companion web site where you can download all the code, which really adds to the usefulness of the book. It is rare for a reference book to be engaging reading, but whoever laid out the pages here visually complemented the depth of material perfectly. I guess the author and publisher know that, as this is already the second edition of the book. Along with the second edition of Dan Cederholm's Bulletproof Web Design and CSS Mastery by Andy Budd, this is a great way to learn the ins and outs of CSS. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I like books that build examples step by step, where this book gives the finished code all at once, then discusses notable parts of the markup."
4,I love the book,"I really like the book. It is simple and easy to understand. It is small so you can finish it, unlike most of coding books that are huge and imposible to finish"
4,Good for beginners,This book is good for beginners who are looking to style using CSS. I'm using it for a Web Publishing class and it provides easy steps to follow.
5,I wish I'd bought this book first...,"The explanations in this book leave very little to the imagination. In other words they are clear & concise & the author makes no assumptions about previous knowledge. I had read Elizabeth Castro's ""XHTML & CSS"" then Andy Budd's ""CSS Mastery"" & although they both gave me a good understanding of what can be done they failed to truly explain how to use markup & styling like this guy does. I like the fact that he doesn't seem like he's full of himself either. It really does take more than one book & a lot of hands on to get good at this stuff & I'd recommend this book as either the starting point for a beginner or to round off the edges of an intermediate designer."
5,Helpful Text Book,This was the required text for a web design class. It was easy to follow and gave good examples for designing with CSS. Also a very good reference for those comfortable with CSS.
5,Great read,"I needed this book for web class, but I would recommend it for anyone who needs to brush up on their CSS. It's also a great book for beginners. It's easy to read and not too technical. The coding is laid out in a clean, understandable manner. I would recommend it!"
5,Well written and attractively designed,"This book is a great example of well-written and beautifully designed technical reference book. It is an excellent resource for learning CSS. The author writes with clarity, enthusiasm, and humor, and the examples are well illustrated. I found the color highlights in the code examples very helpful.I wanted to learn CSS by myself, so I borrowed from the library the Stylin' with CSS 2nd edition, along with another CSS reference book. While I gave up on the other book after a couple of chapters, I read Stylin' from cover to cover; and decided it was worth buying it. Now I own it and refer to it when writing my own code."
5,There is a newer version of this book available for just a few dollars more.,"A great book. But be aware that this is the first edition, published in 2005, and a newer version was published in 2007.I bought this book for a class. I know I visited Amazon's page where they sell the second edition, but I somehow ended up with this one. IMHO, Amazon shouldn't be selling older editions. I can't return it because I've already started to use it."
2,Good in a cheesy way,"This is a good read for traveling and a long weekend. It is very cliched, which makes it funny in some parts but the Southern stereotypes were very annoying and old and very untrue, obviously the author has never been to Atlanta."
2,Awful and boring,I was really looking forward to reading this book after the reviews posted. It was such a boring book and a waste of time. I kept on reading hoping it would get better!
1,Froget it,"I read this book after reading ""The Started Wife"" (which I enjoyed) and threw it out, waste of time."
1,Maneater,"This book was beyond bad. In fact, it may be the worse book I have ever read and I have read a lot of books. The plot was lacking and total idiotic, the characters were cliched and truly loathsome and worse of all, the editing was non-existent. I have heard this book described as fun and light and instead argue that it is torturous to read. I truly believe the only reason this book was published was because of the author's married name. It just goes to show that in Hollywood it's not about one's talent but about the talent they marry."
4,Bitchy Fun,"Clarissa is a Beverly Hills socialite/party girl who knows the best places to be seen and noticed. She is also a spoiled, daddy's girl who lives off her father who pays for her Beverly Hills apartment and for her BMW. Everything about her screams the must have trend at the moment. She has her clique of her four best friends (which she calls the Starchamber), one whom she cannot stand and calls Evil, why bother with a friend like that. But I suppose it adds bite/drama to the story. She finally finds the ""one"" (mostly because of his huge bank account) from her waiter/friend and is already planning their wedding even before she meets him, which causes a bit of a problem. This books has a lot of turns and twists and surprises. This book was enjoyable and kept me glued to the pages. While I didn't care for Clarissa as a person she did make a good story."
3,Just a bit too trendy&#65533;,"Thirty-something (she's perennially 28) Clarissa Alpert has no job, no mate, but fabulous shoes and friends! However, Clarissa decides it's getting time for her to catch herself a man to settle down with and sets her sights on Aaron Mason, the latest, hottest new producer in town. With the help of her four friends (one who seems like a Paris Hilton copy(...)) Clarissa starts to plan the wedding of her dreams, before the couple even has a first date! Clarissa gets what Clarissa wants, so landing Aaron shouldn't be a problem...should it? Clarissa does get a bit on the nerves occasionally, and sometimes all the trendy nods in the book makes it feel like it will be quickly dated. However, it was mostly a fun read, since Clarissa is quite the unpredictable character!"
1,Don't waste your time,This book was so bad that I feel compelled to offer a review any and every where I can just to save other poor readers from it. It's plot line is predictable and boring. I would be hard pressed to say that there was even one original thought in the entire book. I see now why Ms. Grazer felt the need to apologize to her parents in the dedication. I would call for a refund!
4,guilty pleasure,"This book was a guilty pleasure. The impressive thing that Levangie Grazer manages to pull off is that it's about the LA rich and shallow, yet I still cared about the main character and her quest to marry well. As the ""wife of"" the author knows first hand about the sharkfested Hollywood culture, yet she manages to satirize those she is swimming alongside. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting by the pool on my vacation and getting to enjoy that world without actually having to be in it!"
2,MANEATER,"I just received this book a couple of weeks ago. I have not yet read it, and therefore cannot give it a review. However, it was highly recommended to me by two co-workers. Other than that, I did receive my product in a timely manner, which is very important to me. This was my first time to do business with Amazon, and it was a pleasant experience."
2,What LA is that?,"Whenever I read a book set in ""LA"" I ask myself-- who are these horrible, sick, twisted people??? As a Los Angeles native, I've never had the misfortune to meet anyone as disgusting as the Clarissa-types. While I knew the book wasn't exactly going to be literature, I got tired of the mean spirited, shallow, self-serving ""humor"" and profanity. A spoof or a satire might make an amusing short story, but page after page after page after page of the same snotty, rude and ""not-funny jokes"" are not only tiresome, but aren't a good substitute for a good, entertaining story. As I said-- what horrible, sick, twisted characters."
4,Funny stage for a hilarious comedy,"Hoolywood and Los Angeles entirely contemplated from a woman's point of view, and not any woman, but a young woman who wants to marry a rich man. Her theory about that manhunt, her practice of that sport, her prey and her hunting technique that leads her to a quick marriage and a quick pregnancy. Unluckily she did not check who the man really was and accepted who he was supposed to be. Of course he is not who he is supposed to be and this leads to a tremendous imbroglio. The book is funny, extremely funny and positively optimistic. The author does believe in love and does believe love can survive any small or big detail that may be thought as capable of pooping the party. In other words, this book is not - and it does not pretend to be - very deep about women or Los Angeles. It is a vivid and dynamic picture of the scene and the action that takes place on that scene, or shouldn't I say that stage. Entertaining and relaxing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
1,Not worth the required effort...,"Only rarely have I not finished reading every page of a chosen novel, but this uninteresting story with uninteresting characters has become one of those instances. Thankfully, it must be returned to the library, and I can finally start reading something worthwhile."
1,One of the worst,"So boring, I had to fight myself to finish. Boring. Waste of time for anyone... Female or Male.. I suggest she stay with her other career.. I never write reviews.. first.. awful.."
1,SKIP IT!!,"I give these kids credit for trying. But, this is one of the worst wrestling DVD's I've ever seen. Bad camera work, trampoline wrestling, and it's not as gory as the other two (mark) reviewers say. Save your ten bucks and buy a CZW or ECW DVD instead."
4,"Wonderful product, but.....","This is a wonderful all natural powder, with a mild, fresh, natural scent, and it seems to work very well. I would love to give this a very high mark.BUT!!It's a very small 3oz container. That's about 3"" tall and 1"" wide. And with S&H; you're paying over $5 and oz for this.Great stuff, but not worth $5 an oz!"
2,You can't make a good movie with a bad book,"Well, I haven't read the book, but it's probably airport trash. Barbara ""Covett""? Bathsheba ""Hart""? Steven ""CONnelly""? We're talking Joan Collins level, or a bodice ripper that Fabio is on the cover of. I'm amazed that two great actors would find anything to give of themselves to this exploitative, prurient stupidity. Only in terms of taboo breaking does this film have any impact. Cate Blanchett makes out with a 16 year old, and Judi Dench is a vampiric,creepy,aging lesbian. Both are teachers at an English high school and Dench lures the confused Blanchett into a bizarre relationship using her knowldge of Cate's teen tryst as leverage. I don't know if these actors are stretching their boundaries or naive, or both, but if you like a good train wreck, oh, baby, is this the right flick for you."
2,Just alright,"I found this film to be very odd. I thought it would be interesting and different and of course with these types of actors in it, It seemed like a great equation. However, I was practically bored to tears watching this. I tried to get into it, but the whole plot seemed pointless and odd. And towards the end it just became ridiculous and I didn't care what happened to anybody in the film."
3,Difficulty in watching,"I have long been a fan of Judy Dench and have nearly every film she has made. I have great difficulty watching Notes on a Scandal - in fact I have yet to complete it. Not because of the theme but simply because Dame Judy is a great actress and I find her performance so real and I dislike her character so much I don't want to watch her. This may sound strange but that is the case. Cate Blanchett never hits the button, perhaps this is why Dench's performance is too strong for the balance of the film."
4,"Well-acted, but predictable","Seeing Judi Dench in the role of a villainess was the attraction to me. Sadly, Cate Blanchett didn't offer her much of a challenge. While some people likened this to a ""Duel of the Titans"" for actresses, Dench carried away the prize without much of a fight from Cate.I wouldn't call this film a thriller, though. You don't quite know what to expect and the soundtrack leads you to believe something awful is going to happen. That is true--but I tend to think of thrillers as having some element of violence, rather than simply tragedy, there.To me, the end was predictable from near the beginning of the film. What kept me watching was how the end would be accomplished and how. I rented this film and would not purchase it to watch again in the future."
4,NOW YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE HOME SCHOOL,One thing this movie did was hold my attention. The two lead actresses are two of the best working today and they defiantly made what could have been just a sickening story something worth watching. To have two so different but equally unfit teachers in one school and make it not seem over the top is a credit to the writers of this movie. One teacher like either of these women would have nearly closed down some schools.My favorite scene: The mother of the boy coming to the art teacher's house.Least favorite scene: Art teacher using the bathroom. Wayyyyyy unnecessary
4,Great escape,"I read the book first, so I knew what to expect. They skipped all the boring parts and it was an entertaining film. Not a bad performance in the bunch and a decent script as well."
4,"RICHARD EYRE, OPUS 6","***1/2 2006. Based on Zoe Heller'sWhat Was She Thinking?: Notes on a Scandal: A Novel, this film was directed by British director Richard Eyre. Four nominations for the 2007 Academy awards. An aging teacher (Judi Dench) tries to seduce a younger colleague (Cate Blanchett) by using emotional pressure and psychological blackmail. Good screenplay and excellent actors. Original."
2,Social decay in film...,"I can't give a film that has brought ruin to several young American teachers a good review. This film is a torch at the edge of our educational system.I think this may be a British fault as I saw another story about an homosexual British history master.In any case it was delivered by an American company that should have known better.As an art film with an X rating , I would approve of such a film as drama and art, but not as a popular widely distributed as we see here.The acting is first rate British even in the smaller parts.The film editing and photography is first rate.The script is gripping and very well written.It is the subject material that is so suspectand socially contaminated.This film is a lot like giving small pox infected blankets to the Indians,as the modern American is morally unable to see the danger here."
3,Great fun!,"After an uncomfortable hour of Middle Class coffee table navel gazing I decided ""Scandal"" was best treated as a comedy. A southern gothic like ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" transposed to Blighty.A hoot!"
3,Not what I was expecting. Watch for the acting *possible spoiler*,"I watched this movie last weekend On Demand, and after waiting so long and having people hype it up for me, I was very let down. The acting was top notch, given what they had to work with, but beyond that, it wasn't worth the hype.I couldn't connect w/any of the characters. For me, everything was on the surface. Yes, Cate and Dame Dench did a good job, but they almost seemed to be phoning it in. I couldn't feel a thing for either one of these women. I'm gonna assume that we were to feel for CB's character, but she had zero redeeming qualities. Her affair sickened me, and when she had her first scene w/the student, I had to check IMDb to check his age. He was 20, I think, but looked so young that it creeped me out and turned my stomach.And there was no resolution to the story. Dench's character just moved on to another victim. Waste of time, and it makes me hesitant to read the book."
5,Notes on a Sacndal,How both Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett did NOT win Oscars for their performace in this movie is baffling. A movie to watch over and over!
2,The 2 stars are for the acting ONLY!,"For those of us who bothered to read the book, the movie was sub-par, to be polite. The character of Barbara (Judi Dench) is villified beyond need and that of Sheba (Cate Blanchett) somehow manages to get our sympathy. No! This is not the feeling I got from the book! If I have to say something nice, the acting is good.On further reflection: why did they have to make the lesbian tendency SO obvious??? It was a little bit more than a hint in the book but it's FULL blown in the movie. Does the movie watcher HAVE to know EVERYTHING with certainty???"
5,Uncontrollable and Misunderstood Psychological Urges,"NOTES ON A SCANDAL is a mesmerizing psychological study in personal, transgressions, perceptions, misconceptions and the search for the true meaning of love vs. infatuation, friendship and lasting partnership. Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett give incredible performances as one lives by deliberate and manipulative trechery while the other is more passive and nave in her posturing. They truly both do not realize to what depths they have succumbed to through their lives' experiences until circumstances come to a head that is beyond the control of either of their actions. This is an outstanding but often unpleasant film but well worth the experience."
1,ionlygaveit 1 star togetpeopletoreadit itis 5stars,"This movie is worthy of Shakespeare- it reveals the duplicity- the reality behind human pretensions- ""Mind the gap"" = the difference between life as u dream it and life as it is-Since this is my one star review, let me say that: the movie could go SO MUCH FURTHER- delving into human realities-Wonderful performances- wonderful plot and premise- that is:(my private interpretation)The media that covered this scandal (and all others)?to me- the media is as blameworthy as the perpetrators becaust- it is beholden to advertisers and the writers and anchors are all lieing"
4,DOUBLE STANDARD,"WHAT IF SHE WAS A GIRL WITH AN OLDer MAN??? this woman is what they would call a cougar..sleeping with a young boy, cool? same as movie READER"
1,SCANDAL-LESS-NOTES,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS.Well....what can I say? This is a dreary and dull film leaving no redemption or satisfaction for the main characters and the audience as well. So a young teacher gets caught with her knickers down while making ""naughty, naughty"" over one of her students. Common news, nowadays. The fact that she gets caught by a rather elderly and matronly teacher seeking same sex companionship is a an unfortunate coincidence. And away we go...sailing downhill waiting to hit the bottom of the barrel with remarkable success.What's the point?One wonders what vague period of drowsy longings gave birth to this cinematic event.One wonders why Ms. Dench and Ms. Blanchett would even bother.1 Star for that wonderful hairstyle Lady Judi had to endure."
1,Two Great Actresses Celebrate Homophobia,"I thought that plots involving manipulative, sullen, older lesbians manipulating younger ""innocent"" women had been left behind with the perjorative films of the 40's and 50's. Apparently the idea is still alive. To make matters worse, Blanchett is paired with a student lover who looks all of 12. A complete waste of talent."
4,Heartwrenching and So True to Life,I've seen this film a number of times and each time it gets better.Can one pick two more brilliant actresses than Dench and Blanchett??? NO. They are superb.And terrifying in their absolute lack of understanding of each other's life.Bill Nighy is his awesome self. The young boy actor is perfect for his truthful portrayal of a boyhis age full of curiosity and insouciance.Must see.
1,junk,"This book actually has a picture of a living neanderthal, can you believe it? A Living Neanderthal Man-- which is supposed to be extinct!Actually, the author just snapped a picture of some African tribesman with an usually big head! What a joke!"
3,outdated,The factual material - including medical information and Internet resources - is largely outdated. In my opinion the book should be updated or removed from current printing. It seems unfair to sell health care consumers who seek information on treating brain injury with factual information that is not useful.Take this book as an understanding of the sciences as they existed fifteen years ago.
3,some good info but a big problem,"This book probably has more useable info than the other 4 books I've ordered on the topic, but I have one big problem with it. It assumes, or almost insists, that you'll never be the same. It doesn't hold out hope for full recovery. I can't handle that."
5,"A must read, very insightful, helpful and comprehensive","If you or someone you care about is dealing with mild traumatic brain injury or concussions this is an excellent book. The technical aspects of brain injury are explained in plain english. The remainder of the book is well written and insightful. The book explains a very inexact ailment in very understandable terms. It discusses ""post concussive syndrome"" with the its hundreds of different symptoms which appear and disappear. This is one book that will help everything come together in a clear and concise way.AN EXCELLENT READ ON A TOUGH SUBJECT."
1,"Don't waste you money, useless book","This book told me absolutely nothing about MTBI. In fact, it was more of personal story of the author's dealings with her case of MTBI. Amazingly she had every single symptom described in the book--over 40-50 symptoms! Don't waste your money."
4,Availability?,"Hi,Where can I buy this game? It doesn't seem like it's availablein North America. I can't find it listed on amazon's UK site either.Thanks..."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, he just returned from a semester in Cuba...he said the DVD was awful."
3,It's out There,"Ok, this film was a little unusual. I'm not really into the giant monsters fighting in the city type of anime. I saw enoguh of that when I watched Godzilla as a child.This film does however offer some positive aspects. The animation is nice, and the first part of the three part film is rather interseting. As soon as the giant creatures start having at it though, the film begins to lose its appeal.My main dilemma when wathcing the film was trying to decide whether I was enjoying it or not. I think the relationship aspect was more interesting then the battles, which is not want you want to target in a good anime.What this film really needed was some aliens, or to be set in the future. The creatures which were supposed to be from the past, looked like mechs, which did not make much sense.I can't say this was the best anime I ever saw, but I would'nt call it the worst either. If you're really willing to let go of reality, you might just enjoy this film."
1,horrible phone,"Thank goodness this was a gift! It lasted only 1 year. The only good things I can say about this phone had was the reception and the remote access to messages.The cons:1)The handset: after 8 months, I began to have trouble dialing the numbers and now, if I want to dial a phone number that has a ""5"" in it, I have to bang it a few times and press it like 10 times to see if I'm lucky enough to get to dial the phone number. Also, I have missed several phone calls since the answer button works whenever it wants.2) the battery: it doesn't last too long and it doesn't warn you battery is low.hate this phone, and I especially don't recommend it for anyone with babies or toddlers because this phone can't take the abuse."
2,Skip It,"Pros: Nice looking, easy to use, good control from remote phones, feels solid, lasted 2 years and still same as new.Cons: Occasional bizarre loss of connection with base (needs to be turned face-up in base for 10 seconds to reconnect!), 1 hour talk time between full charges (which is totally unacceptable), very poor message clarity.I would just pass on this one even though it was relatively cheap for its day."
1,You get what you pay for,"Wow! A 900mhz cordless phone with digital answering machine for under ..., that's amazing! Sounds almost too good to be true. Well, it is too good to be true. The ... you pay is great for all the features, but one of the most important qualities of a telephone is lost in this product: hearing the other person's voice. Not only is it difficult to hear people you're speaking with, it is nearly impossible to hear most messages. Unfortunately, I've had the phone for almost 2 years, so I know what I'm talking about. While the range is impressive, and the features are easy to use, not being able to hear the voice on the other end clearly earns this phone 1 star."
4,DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!!,"First off, I *had* this model of phone for 11 months. It was fried during a lightning storm. However, before that, it worked FOR ME flawlessly....up to the bitter end. It had simple features, the answering machine was adequate, the handset was very light-weight, the base was compact and could be wall mounted, I could hear the caller, the caller could hear me, etc. etc.I think what is important to note here is that the phone was fine FOR ME. Maybe not for the other reviewers and maybe not for you. Don't read these reviews, for any phone, and then purchase the phone that has the best reviews. These reviews are so, so, so skewed. Buy your phone from a store that will let you return the phone for 100% of your money back with no questions asked should you not like the phone. That way YOU can find the phone that is right for YOU! Don't listen to me, don't listen to these other people. LISTEN TO YOURSELF!"
5,It's true,The person I bought this for has been marked for death by the sun. She wages a constant battle against the ball of fire in the sky. Who will win? Tune in next week!
4,Good product at a great price,I use this regularly to shoot video. It lets me be wire free and that is a big help when doing simple instructional videos. Less to fuss over.
4,Very Cute,I bought this for my grandma for Christmas. She loved it. When it comes in the mail the sign & smoke pipe are detached. The sign you simply stick in it's place hole. It stays well. The smoke pipe comes with a screw to attach it yourself (helps prevent damage in shipping). Everything looked great except by the time it came to me in the mail 2 of the park benches had come unglued. Used a little wood glue to put it back together & it was good as new. :) Very pleased with the product overall.
2,Cute but not practical,"I bought this birdhouse to hang under the big tree in the yard. But the bird house did not come with the hanging hook. The material appeared to be too fragile to put a metal hook in its roof. So we ended up putting it indoors near the window. After a few weeks, pieces of the chair and table came off. So we have to keep on gluing them back. Not sure if this is expected for all of the wooden birdhouses. Too much maintenance for me. Will not get wooden birdhouse in the future."
3,Skeeve is too stupid in this one.,"I greatly enjoyed the first six books in this series, but Skeeve has learned a lot in them. He can't still be this dumb. I enjoyed Aahz's world of Perv, though."
1,disappointing,"I had not read any of the Myth books in several years, but I picked this one up recently because it looked interesting. It is undoubtedy the worst Myth adventure that I have read(even worse than Myth-ing Persons(!)). No one can be as stupid as Skeeve is, particularly someone with his experiences. He should have grown up by now, and he hasn't. Usually the books work because his companions are interesting, but in this one Skeeve has an adventure of his own, and handles it, and himself, badly. The book wasn't worth the effort of reading it."
3,myth-ing the point,"I love his books (up to now). I think they are inspired, quite often he is better than Pratcett, and lets face it that is good. However the main feeling I get form this book is that it lack humility, subject and perhaps most importantly a point. It has good jokes, some excelent moments but overall it has no heart. Sorry Robert but this one fails to impress."
1,"Cannot install, at all","I am trying to install on my Dell Inspiron 8100 on XP SP2. The computer does not recognize the card when I insert it in the PCMCIA slot. I go ahead and run the installation program and it crashes. Bad!!!I just bought it, but, the disk label is dated 3/2002. I tried downloading a newer version form IBM/Lenovo but had the same results.Does the fact that Windows does not detect the card when I insert it in the PCMCIA slot mean that it is bad?"
1,These Speakers are TERRIBLE!!!,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
5,The Old Limey not a Lemon,"My husband loves this book...I will hear a chuckle from time to time and look to see what he's reading, and it's The Old Limey."
3,Something is missing,"I enjoyed this book. I really did. I have recommended this book to many friends but I had the feeling throughout that it had been heavily edited to bring it down to a manageable 300 or so pages and to make it more palatable to movie studios. You occasionally caught glimpses of fantasy elements worthy of Cervantes but they never seemed to go far. It seemed as if the Old Limey's daydreams were cut short by the editor's red pencil just as they were picking up steam. I have to wonder if this is the book the author wanted to write.With that criticism, it is very funny, very enjoyable, and highly recommended."
1,Insipid,"I made it about one-third of the way through before I lost all interest due to plot weakness. The ""hero"" ends up being brain dead."
2,Poorly designed scooper blade,"I recently ordered 2 different litter scoops from Amazon. This particular one impressed me with the long handle and the large scoop both of which I thought would make cleaning 6 little boxes daily much easier. Unfortunately, this model has a serrated edge on the scoop which breaks up the clumps in the litter that I'm trying to remove. That is not the purpose of a good scoop. I do love the long handle, but the manufacturer could redesign the blade of the scoop to be more efficient."
2,Not ergonomic.,"Bought this scoop because of all the great reviews. Was disappointed pretty much right of the bat. Yes, the scoop is big, and yes it's sturdy, but the angle of the handle is so steep relative to the shovel, that when you have to apply any pressure, you have to make your wrist do the work, rather than your whole arm as it is with most other scoops. Also as some have mentioned, the gaps are pretty big, and after a few days of scooping, the litter had lots of little debris floating in it. This could be a great scoop if they lowered the angle a little and reduced the gap size. I'm going to give this to someone else hoping they like it and will try the other metal scoop available here on Amazon...Edit:Added a picture of my scoop, I received a brown one."
1,Wrong Product Delivered,"I ordered these blue scoops form AceHardwareOutlet and they sent a mix of blue and black scoops. I subsequently notified them and returned the wrong, black, scoops and they said they would replace them with the proper blue pieces. Well, the replacent scoops were delivered and again they were a mix of blue and black!!! The lesson here is ""Don't expect to get what you ordered"". The order was fullfilled by AG Lock and Hardware of Brooklyn, New York through their warehouse in Albany. I have asked for more blue scoops to replace the wrong black ones but ""Alex"" in customer service said they don't have anymore blue scoops and the item was removed from Amazon. As you can see the item is still listed. Don't order this unless you have no concerns about getting what is advertized."
5,Cat's Delight,"Due to arthritis and back pain I had become unable to scoop Thomas's litter box after each use as I had been doing and had to rely on a once a day service by a caregiver. This distressed both me and my adorable 10-yr-old rescue cat and he began holding his urine until the box was clean -- not healthy for a cat his age. The day before this scoop arrived, he watched her leave, and as soon as the door shut behind her, he got up and went to the litter box.This scoop has made it possible for me to attend to his comfort myself and we are both delighted.Just sign meA cat slave!!"
5,LOVE this thing!,"After having my other litter scooper break, I was on the hunt for the perfect one. Here it is! It's so sturdy and huge, makes it a million times more pleasant to scoop up poop (lol) and I can't imagine it breaking, ever. Thanks Petmate."
4,Litter Scoop,I like it because you can just stand up and clean out the litter box and it's strong so it doesn't bend at all.
3,Works as it should,"This is a large scoop compared to others. Compared to the myriad of scoops that I have owned in the past, this one for some reason always seems to end up with an abundance of feces stuck to it that needs to be cleaned before I can put it away. I have never had that problem in the past."
3,Very large kitty scoop,"I liked this Large, long handeled scoop to clean the big clumps from my litter boxes ( I have 10 cats) but I still require the use of a shorter , flat edged scoop with a finer siffter to complete the job. It is a good product I would recommend to friends."
3,Good scoop,"I bought this scoop about a year ago in-store. I was debating between a metal scoop and this one and was hesitant to buy another plastic scoop because of the durability and strength usually lacking in them.This scoop was great for its lifespan- loved the long handle and the sturdy feel it had. Unfortunately, it broke a couple weeks ago and I am now going to buy a metal scoop. I do not know if the scoop was at fault or the person who was cleaning my kitties litter boxes while I was away is, but it broke the day I got home and was scooping the boxes."
5,An excellent look at Bomber Command,"The author gives an interesting look at navigating a bomberat night during World War 2, but what sets this book apartis the author's analysis of bombing during the War.While I disagree with his theory that the War could have beenended in 1943 (I doubt Hitler thought he was defeated)his views on the morality of area bombing make for a veryinteresting read."
3,Not really about Dresden,This book is not really about Dresden but more about several bombing raids dresden being one of them. The last 50 pages is about Dresden. Its a good read but its not about Dresden as much as it claims to be
1,Single,"Being a longtime follower of Bill Champlin this CD was dissapointing. First of all the sound quality is very poor, I don't know if being recorded in Japan had anything to do with this. All of the text is oriental, very strange. This CD cannot compare with Bill's last one. There are only 9 songs on this album and the cost was $26! I feel like I was taken advantage of. You can do bettet than this Mr. Champlin."
2,Pampers Easy Ups,"I do not like these. Our regular brand is Huggies. These had no velcro sides, so they were hard to remove if my son had a dirty diaper. They are also more bulky than the Huggies and had to be changed more often. I sent these to the pre-school to be used as extras, because I disliked them so much."
4,one size to small,I do like these pull ups but they are one size to small. I normally buy 3t 4t so I ordered 4t. Next time I will go with 5t. I have not had any problems with leaks. I like them just need a bigger size.
3,Nice and functional but better have a fully potty trained child,"I really don't mind these diapers but man if your child is not yet fully potty trained these can lead to some disastrous changes. This is especially true if like us you have a curious one year old always roaming around and inquiring :) Also, these seem a bit smaller and snugger than the size 4 diapers from Pampers so my child is having a hard time actually pulling them down by himself. Having said all that, if you can get a good price for them they will do the job."
2,You Get what you pay for,I'm so des appointed whit pampers easy ups :( product is very poor quality my 2 year old look like he was wearing a ton he was very uncountable and he try to pulled out don't buy this yuo won't be happy y try to save money And spend more buying a new paked of huggies
3,"Good, except for the sides","I thought these would be as good as Huggies, but they're not. The thing I love about Huggies is that they have velcro sides. When my son sits on the potty, often he is already wet. I can tear these pull-ups off, but to get new ones on, I have to strip him, including shoes off, to get a new one on, then redress him. What a pain! I would LOVE to see Pampers mirror Huggies' idea and have some way to put a new pair of these on without having to go through such a rigamorole.Thanks"
1,Leaked every night,These leaked every night my 3 yr old son wore them (he's potty trained in the day time). Previously he was in size 6 Huggies diapers and then used Huggies pull-ups. Neither of those ever leaked (maybe ONCE). Returned these after three nights of a wet bed. Don't bother!
5,"Good trainers, but don't hold a lot","We've tried all the brands of trainers we could find. Settled on these because they're easy to put on and the easy tear sides for removing them.My little boy only needs these at night, but sometimes he saturates them so they leak. Other brands do the same. Wish someone would make these larger sizes with extra capacity.My boy also likes these best as they are more comfortable for him. :)The easy tear sides make them easy to take off. We've had only 1 of hundreds start to come apart at the sides.Overall happy with the brand especially with amazon mom discout and free shipping. Added 1 star due to Amazon's great price."
5,Great product,"The price on these w. Amazon mom and the subscribe and save discount is great. It's very close to what I pay for Wal Mart brand diapers. THese are much easier for my little one too, at least he can put a new one on by himself!"
2,Too small,"I usually buy Huggies Pull-Ups in size 3T/4T but decided to try these Easy-ups in the same size for slightly cheaper. They were too small for my 3 yr old son - especially in the back. Whenever I took his pants off,the Easy-up would be halfway down his butt! Plus I don't like that they don't have the 'tabs' on the sides for easy changing like the Pull-ups. Going back to the Huggies!"
1,Size too small - not good for liquid/watery stools,I bought these pull ups for my son who is 26 months.I got the sizes 2T&3T and they were too small. What a big disappointment! I wish I could send them back but it is too much work.Other thing I need to add to this review is that these pull ups are not good for liquid/watery stools. I had some accidents to learn that I can't put my son on them if he is having diarrhea.
1,Strong Smell,"I got these for my son thinking they were a great deal, and they are as long as you don't mind whatever smell it is that they put in the diapers. I guess it is something like a baby powder fragrance. I hate it. Hopefully, I have a friend that uses these on her kids because I've only used 2 and I'll be going to the store today to buy something else. Blech."
3,Won't buy them again,"I bought these to try instead of the Pull Ups for my 2 1/2 year old step son. I was very disappointed with them. They hold very little and my little man ends up wetting through them if were not careful! Also, a major deal breaker is the fact that they dont reseal on the sides like the Pull Ups do. Be gentle, too! They tear easy on the sides and Ive ended up having to toss a brand new one!"
5,the best in my opinion,Love them...my little ones both used these....fit my boys great and prevented leaks too....easy for them to pull up and down.
3,I keep accidentally buying these,"These pull ups work fine. They don't leak, are cute, and a good price. However, I hate them because I have to rip them off of my son to change him. It doesn't sem right to have to rip his clothes off. As soon as I am done with these, I will be happy."
2,Rip easy on pull up!,"These are nice for absorbency BUT i didn't realize that these didn't fasten like a diaper which would be fine but they are not as big as i thought they would be. Even though my almost three year old is in the weight category for these they just don't seem to fit right and they tend to tare if your not VERY VERY careful on the pulling them up part. Because he is not using the potty AT ALL for a #2, his cheeks of his hinny kind of stick out a little bit and makes for a VERY VERY messy cleanup and clean cloths. Just not impressed with these at all and probably will not purchase again."
1,disappointing,"I expected them to be similiar to Pull-Up with the exception of the sides (they do not open and reclose like Pull-ups), but I was very disappointed. They fit poorly. They absorb very little. Overall they do no do what I need."
3,"Cheaper than Pull Ups, but quality not as great","I have a 2.5 year old that is almost fully potty trained. He wears Easy Ups at preschool because he cannot do #2 on the potty yet, so I can't really rate it as far as how much pee it can hold. I do find that by the end of the day (in case he does not go #2 and he is still wearing the same training pants from the morning) the cotton is clumpy and they feel like they are going to disintegrate. Pull Ups hold up better I think. Some people have complained about the sides tearing, but this is actually an advantage for me because it makes it easy to change him after #2. I honestly bought these because my son loves Diego, and since they're cheaper I don't mind them at all."
3,too tight,The pampers trainers seem to fit super tight for the size. Compared to others this was nota very easy brand of pull up. I tried it multiple times but preferred Huggies slip on's.
3,Well worth the money,"We are using these for potty training. I normally do not like any pampers products. This is my one exception. You get more diapers for less money then you do with the pull ups. The Diego design is nice, but we don't watch Diego in our house, so they don't offer much encouragement with our son. The diapers hold well, but don't last overnight, and they have a funny smell to them."
3,Its okay,bought for 22 month old got the size 4 because he wears size 4 pamper cruisers and fits perfectly Easy to put on while toilet training However leaks at night. Def not recommended for long car rides or at night time unless child can hold bladder.
4,Size is smaller than expected,I think the sizes is much smaller than it should be. The size 4 Easy Ups are the same size as Huggies size 3 diapers (my son was wearing size 4 Huggies diapers). If I would have known that I would have ordered size 5. I do not care for the smell. I love that they are soft like undies. I do not like that once you rip the sides to take it off that you can not roll them up and keep them closed like a diaper. It is a major inconvenience when my son poops in the Easy Ups.
4,"Soft, comfortable, absorbent but don't get too aggressive taking the sides apart.","3t/4t is just big enough for my 37lb 4 year old. Soft, thinner than Huggies, and absorbent, it does the job. However, I just about made a huge mess on my bed while taking one off my child. A part of the diaper ripped open, spilling some of the wet crystal bits outward. Luckily I was able to contain the mess and have learned not to do a ""Hulk"" when changing subsequent diapers."
2,Didn't fit and leak,The pampers didn't fit my son. They leaked all the time and are not absorbent as it says on the box. For sure it's not a diaper for night time!!!!!
2,My little guy finds them uncomfortable,These run small and like I said my little guy finds them uncomfortable and fights me over putting them on. They also tear easily.
4,Does the job,"I use these for my 2 year old son who is currently potty training. I have to say that I like Huggies Pull-Ups better, but these were cheaper, so I gave them a try. They do the job, but I don't like that the sides are tear-away rather than reusable (like Huggies). My so loves the pictures on them."
4,Very good,"Very good, they seem comfortable on my child and very soft compared to other brands. The only problem is I had a couple rip when I was putting them on my son, however that was far and few between. I actually already placed an order to get more and I do recommend them to everyone else while potty training!"
4,OKAY,These pullups are okay....a little hard to take off once soiled....my baby loves DORA AND DIEGO.....but I got a good deal on them and they served their purpose.
2,Disappointed,I was always loyal to Pampers and tried these Easy Ups before any other brand. It's very disappointing that the side flaps don't open (you basically have to rip them open). Because of the that it just made sense to switch to Pull Ups.
2,didn't like them,they had a lot of leaks. they didn't fit tight enough so we had a problem if my child went to the bathroom in it
2,too small for 2T boys,"I bought this training pants a week ago, i made a big mistake because it is so small for my 26months old kid although this size is for 2T-3T, it is really misleading to Mums. pls take note of this."
2,"Design not good, runs too small","I switched to these from the Huggies Pull-Ups, and these were bad enough where I had to again buy the Pull-ups while still having several of these for basically the reasons that they run pretty small (I bought size 5 for 30-40 lbs, and my son is 30 lbs and they are tight), and also the fact that the sides have no velcro opening so I have to rip them open when I change him if he does #2. They are fine for the wetness. So, we can only use these at night so I can use them up. Totally flawed design in my opinion."
2,Powder scented and a little harsh,"Compared to other brands I didn't like the powder scent. They also caused a rash so they seem harsher than the Huggies Pull Ups and Seventh Gen we use. Full disclosure, my son has sensitive skin in the Winter and he grew up in Seventh Gen diapers. But, these still didn't cut it compared to the rest."
3,Do the job,"I tried these as an alternative to Huggies Pull Ups and I do not like them as much. Biggest drawback is the sides are not velcroed like pullups, so you must put them on feet first, and when travelling or if my toddler already has his shoes on and we need to do a quick change in a public restroom, it is a pain to remove everything first."
3,Elastic band does not hold the diaper,It only hold two pees during the day then it starts falling to the ankle. Today it failed to hold a regular poop. Big mess in our nice car. My son keeps taking off huggies diamper at night. This product seems to work well for the night time.
2,"It's a size 4, too small for my 26 months old baby","My baby is almost 26 months old. Grow rate in weight is 50%.Not a fat but a healthy weight one. The 2t to 3T diaper is little bit tight on waist, and thight.Compare to a size 4 huggie diaper, this 2T-3Tpull up is smaller.It is a great deal for thin 2 years old baby but not for grow rate at 75% kid.Hope this review that help."
2,Not for training,"Unlike other pull up training pants these do not have velcro for removal if your child has an accident. If your child goes # 2 you have to rip the sides open to avoid getting it all over their legs. Once you rip the sides you can't roll the dirty diaper up for disposal, essentially you're walking around with a cloth full of feces until you find the trash can, no fun if there's an accident without a convenient disposal nearby. Other brands have the velcro sides, if you are actually training and are expecting some accidents don't buy these."
2,Disappointed,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying, although I didn't think I had to since I've been diapering twins for over 3 years. These run too small. The ""size 5"" is not as big as expected and definately smaller than huggies. I also didn't realize the sides were not resealable. I bought 2 and am returning 1."
1,"Cumbersome, blowouts ... no thanks","We've always used Pampers diapers so it was a no-brainer to get the Easy Ups. WRONG. These pull on like shorts, whereas the Huggies Pull Ups detach on the side so you don't have to strip your child to put on a fresh pull up. Also, any time he does #2 in them, it's a blow out. I can't figure out why, but it doesn't happen with diapers or Pull Ups.Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought them. Now, it's Pull Ups all the way."
3,"cheap, absorbent, but they rip","like another reviewer said, these are really weak along the sides. i was surprised when my 3yo kept saying his pants were falling down. well, his easy ups had ripped, and were sideways inside his pants, hanging by one leg. this has happened about 3 times in 30....not so great. on the other hand, these easyups are fairly cheap compared to competitors. i still don't think i'll buy them again. i'm disappointed by the quality, considering that this is a pampers product."
3,Could use improvement,"I like that they're thin, yet absorb very well. Now on to what I do not like. These do not have velcro, so if you want to open them, you have to tear the sides. I know these are training pants and not diapers, but sometimes when I'm putting these on my son, one of the sides will tear, and I have to throw it away. They're not even tight on him! I could actually use the velcro sides to tighten them a bit, so the fit is not the issue. Also, sometimes I'll pull one out, and the side is not attached, forcing me to throw it out since there is no way to hold it closed. Because of this issue, I've swithced to Huggies pull ups, which are also thin and absorbant, but also have velcro sides."
2,WASN'T HAPPY,"I purchased these for my 2 year old, having used the entire Pampers line for him up to this point, as well as for his 5 year old sister when she was younger, and had no problems. When switching to the easy-ups, however, he didn't want to wear them, was constantly itching himself and then developed a diaper rash that would almost go away with medication but never completely. I decided to switch to the Huggies brand and he actually wants to wear them, doesn't scratch anymore, and the rash has gone away (without medication). I'm not really sure why he had trouble with them (I would assume they are the same ""formula"" as the cruisers but maybe not) but have always loved Pampers and will probably try their line again when our third arrives later this year but will just keep a close eye on any rashes or redness and be prepared to switch if necessary."
5,Great price!,I use cloth diapers primarily but needed disposable pull ups for pre-k. The price and quality of the pampers easy ups on Amazon can't be beat. I love shopping on Amazon and have rarely been disappointed.
3,Okay,"These work well for naps and car rides- though they are a little bulky. They don't hold enough for nighttime for my little boy, though. I prefer Target's version of pull ups- they seem to hold just as much (more?) and aren't as bulky."
2,Worst Pampers,"I have always loved pampers for my son. Now that he is at potty training age i have transitioned to pullups. Only these are horrible. They rubbed a sore on my sons bottom from the elastic. They are not as wide as regular diapers, and they dont hold very much at all. Lastly the sides have to be ripped apart to come off. Ill be using huggies for potty training."
2,They don't fit!,"My son is 3 and weighs 26 lbs, and they do not fit him around the waist. His little butt is constantly sticking out. They are bulky on him and he complains about them being uncomfortable. He can easily pull them down, getting them back up is another issue though. Because they are so big, they roll funny and he needs help to get them back up. They also do not reattach once you tear the sides, and this is a tad annoying. It means that anytime he poops I have to completely undress him to put another on. They also do not seem to be very absorbent and have leaked when he has pooped."
4,run small,We love pampers but these are a little misleading. my son wears 2T pants so i ordered these and they didnt fit very well. They are a size 4 diaper. I have switched to the bigger size 3T-4T (or size 5) and they work much better. Other then that we really like the easy ups and they have made potty training much easier
3,Okay!,These are okay... not the best for night time as they do leak. Just depends if my son drinks too much at night.
4,pampers easy ups,"Pampers easy ups are great for leakage protection. The only thing Pampers is missing, is the velcro closure that Huggies pull ups has. However for the price I can do without the velcro closure."
4,Works perfect for our son!,"A friend of mine recommended them to me, and in all honesty, they work great. My son is only 15 months old, but we are slowly introducing him to potty training and these trainers do just that."
3,JIPPED!!,"I ordered by the product description and photo which showed 96ct Easy Ups and got a box of 60. Where did the other 36 diapers go? The product photo and description should match the item advertized. That should be standard for Amazon. Disappointed to say the least.As far as the product goes, I have used the smaller Easy Ups which I would rate fair to good. Some rip easily on the side which is good when you are trying to get them off with out having to pull them off the feet, bad if you are pulling them up and you have to throw away an unused diaper. I was ordering these b/c they were going to be the cheapest, but they didn't end up being the cheapest b/c I didn't get the number I thought I was buying."
4,Needs to be more absorbent,Great design but it does not hold much. I cannot imagine how it could last thru the night. Much better than huggies becuase the materials and the sides are far superior.
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,These do not have the easy open sides like the Huggies Pull-ups do. You have to tear them off if you need to change a dirty one. They are also difficult for the child to pull all the way up on their own.
4,MUCH better for overnight than Huggies!,My kid used to always need a change of diaper half way through the night when we used Huggies Overnight pull-ups. This diaper holds more liquid and lasts overnight! I would recommend most Pampers products over Huggies or most other diaper brands!
1,All Dried up,This was a disappointment. It had been used before and the glue was all dried up.I have learned not to buy used things from Amazon. I don't know why Amazon has it listed on this review asa toy. It is a product used to protect ballet pointe shoes and extend their use.
4,What a variety!,"I've had this book for about a year, and return to it often - whole grain hippie breads, quick breads, oddities I'll never make but enjoy reading about. It's all homey and cheerful, appreciative and old-fashioned. The Taos pumpkin bread is great, my sister loves the one-hour rustic Puerto Rican bread."
2,Expensive and Disappointing,"Save your money. This expensive little (273 page)book was very disappointing. My expectations were high - based on this author's first book - but this one just didn't deliver. Half of the stuff in this book is great - just what you would expect from this author - but the other half is incomplete, inaccurate, or just plain biased toward the author's pet ideas so the reader suffers by the lack of serious in-depth analysis in places where it is sorely needed. Sadly, this subjective approach is also what I have come to expect from this author in recent years, but I had hoped that he could now be more objective. Fortunately, the author's wit shows through in places but that's not enough to make up for the high price of the book or my disappointment in the quality of the material presented."
1,Almost Useless,I am working in a high-tech firm on a team designing XDSL modems. This book was almost useless to our R & D efforts.
2,Good but not great...,"I believe you are referring to Deu 18:10 - 12. I make more typos than most..lol. Anyway, this chapter is addressing the Levites (Tribe of Levi) only. We should not pick and choose phrases and use them out of context.Also, if you really want to understand the ""Old Testament"", read some good research books from the Jewish Publication Society or the Jewish Lights Publishers.Her books are good, not great. Nothing new inside but it is a good way to bring Gnosticism and Spiritism to lay people. Allan Kardec stated most of what is contained in her books in his works.This particular little book is good mainly for the CDRom."
1,"Redundant, Redundant, Redundant!","I have read several Sylvia Browne books when I really only needed to read one. They all practically say the same thing. The tittles are ALWAYS misleading and always, always, ALWAYS lack anything new. I no longer read her books and am no longer a fan. I have moved on to more credible authors and have learned FAR more in doing so. Sylvia Browne's books are a waste of your money in my opinion.Take my advice, always beware of someone charging 850 dollars for a generic 20 min reading over the phone. They are never doing it for your best interest, only their own. Any credible medium will always charge a very fair price(like $20 or so)."
1,waste of time,I think when Silvia first started writing she was good but I'm sorry her last few books including this one are sarcastic and weak. The depth is not there and the joke cracking is out of line. I learned nothing here like I did in her earlier books Waste of money.
3,ok,I knew the product was used but it didn't mention that the CD that went with the book was missing. Disappointing.
1,Very Boring,I can't even describe the act of kindness it took to complete this book. Not a page turner.
2,Not Great,"I was bored with this book. The end was terrible, and the relationships never really evolved. The plot took place to late in the book, with nothing happening in the end. I don't recommend this book. If I would have paid more than $6.99 for this, I would have been mad."
3,Good book.,"This was the first time I read a book by Ms. Little. It was a pretty good book. I read it within three days because I had to see how it was going to end. Even though it was good, I was able to figure out two things about what was going to happen before it was told in the book. 1) I was able to figure out when Alice went to visit her Aunt Thelma and Jack was having problems dealing with what she was going through because she didn't want to stay with him and they work through it, I knew that he was going to go see Sherry and 2) when Alice and Sherry met to have lunch, Sherry was going to tell Alice that she was pregnant.Just because I was able to figure this out does not make it a bad book, it just means that sometimes you can just figure some things out before they happen."
5,EXCELLENT!!,This was the first time that I have read a book by Ms. Little and it was excellent! She kept me reading and reading and I didn't want to put it down. This book describes the lives of many young women who find love when they least expect it. The only thing that left me hanging was the end. It left me wondering what happened after the marriage and whether or not Ms. Sherry was actually pregnant. But overall its a WONDERFUL novel. Keep up the good work Ms. Little.
3,"Superficial, yet entertaining and easy to read.","Although I enjoyed reading this book, I was very disappointed with the message the auther seems to be conveying--Money buys happiness. Alice, the main character, finally decides to marry her cheating fiance, Jack, only after he buys her a luxurious home in a well-to-do neighborhood. Also, the story line and characters are somewhat superficial. With comments like, ""I let him get a whiff of my Annick Goutal"" and ""I threw my Coach duffle in the back seat"" strewn throughout the entire book, the author seems to be perpetuating the elitist behavior and attitudes her main character supposedly despises. After the first couple chapters, those little comments become annoying. All in all, the book was enjoyable--not at all thought-provoking or enlightening--but definitely fun to read."
3,"""In My Book...a review of Good Hair""","In my book, this book ranks somewhere among the choice Black fiction novels of our time. ALthough I am tempted to bless this novel with four stars for its original, realistic story and stunning betrayal, I stop at Three Stars for the simplistic, low-grade style. The story of ghetto girl meets ""bourgie"" aristocrat is original, at least in Black fiction, and is remiscent of my glimpse of the Black elite at the author's Alma Mater, Howard University. This clearly surpasses the level of talent displayed in her sophomore novel, The Itch, whose characters and story line did not seem as genuine and based on real life. As she grows as a writer, her work should become more soulful, more captivating. My toast to Ms. Little: ""To growth and becoming the opposite of her surname!"""
3,Okay,This was the first book that I read by this author and I thought that it was okay. It was not compelling enough for me to read in one day but it was good enough for me to finish.
5,"Great story telling!!! Mature, Intelligent, Proud,...","Excellent story telling with very realistic characters. It shows the true-to-life dynamics of the many different types of people I run across every day in both corporate America and in the neighborhood. It really hit home. Far too often, Black people are limited to certain ""types"". It depicts the true diversity that exists among all people. I loved each and every character as if they were people that I actually know, even Miles and Laura."
3,Good Hair was disappointing.,"An easy book to read. However, Jack's character could have been developed more as well as Sherry Steptoe's character. Alice was too forgiving of Jack's unfaithfulness. I wonder, was it because of love or his status? I don't think I would recommend this one."
3,"A Reader from Baltimore, Md","I thought the book was excellent. I read it in about 3 days. It held my interest from beginning to the end. The book really allow me to focus on my life personally and to address some issues that I have been facing regarding relationships. I belive that the moral or the bottom line to the book, was that the author was trying to expose us to reality, no man or woman is perfect, we must stop looking for ""prince/princess charming"" and take people off of a pedalstool and accept them as they are. I like how the story ended with Jack and Alice, willing to work through their tragedy and to continue on with the marriage. I am not sure that my approach would have been the same, but it has made me more open to forgive and not be so quick to ""cast stones"". I would defintely be interested in reading another book by this author."
1,You can do better,"I bougth the book because I need it for school, unfortunately I coldn't use it, there are many pages with deffects. I couldn't believe that book came from you as a new one. This was my last time to buy books from you, just let me know what can I do to return the boo.Henda D Claro"
3,"A Good Read,","Ms. Little delves into the little talked about world of Upper-Class Black life in this her first novel.I liked Good Hair, although it was not as good as her second release ""The Itch"". The internal racism issues come up in the protagonist's relationship with a man from an ""Old"" family.If you are really interested in the Black Upper Class, may I suggest you read, ""Our Kind of People"" by Lawrence Otis Graham."
4,Great novel!!,"I really enjoyed this novel. Little does a great job of examining the attitudes of the elite blacks within the African American community. I really felt sorry for the character Alice. The situation with her brother, and what he did to her made me actually cry. I think I probably would have been traumatized after that. I can sort of relate to her family situation as well. She felt groomed to be a high achiever, than just being loved the way she was. Her fiance though would have never gotten any forgiveness from me. There is no way I would've taken him back after he cheated. There are no excuses for cheating. Overall though, the novel was good!! I can't wait for the next one to come out."
2,Bad Hair Day for Writer,"This was one of the most stereotypical, substanceless, books FOR us, BY us, and ABOUT us, that I have ever read. What the world does not need now or EVER is another book about the infamous color/class line that our people are so plagued by and deeply ensconced in. I found the plot, or shall I say stumbled upon it in the midst of other wavering issues, to lack any depth. I purchased the book in support of my sister who has to eat and is following her dream. When other commentaries reflected that this was light reading, I think it is fair to say that surely, this one did not give you anything to ponder or grow with."
2,Below your average reading,"I was hearing a lot of hype and enjoyment over this book by friends saying ""You have to read this, girl,"" and ""This book is great,"" so I figured, why not give it a try. WRONG move. This book seemed to move so slow that I almost didn't want to finish it, and that is very unlike me. The book lacked almost everything from start to finish. I was almost not motivated to turn the next page. It seems as if Mrs. Little just threw in plots everywhere throughout the book to make it seem interesting, when actually it did nothing for the story. I gave it a 4 because with all the great African-American authors out now, this is definately below average...how it made National Bestseller, I still don't know."
3,Who is the snob?,"This book left me a little frustrated at the end because while I understood the author was trying to make one or several points, it kind of roamed about aimlessly. She found it easy to point the finger at Jack's circle being so snobby and able to socially classify people, but who was the one that kept talking about her Coach purse and briefcase, her Armani blazer, and Saab. I think she was in a bit of denial. Also, I didn't understand why Jack was so in love w/her as she seemed so depressed and her dialogue was so flat and boring. I didn't sense any connection between them at all. Finally, I found her immensely self-centered. I can't recall one question she asked of anyone - not Jack, Cheryl, her Aunt - no one. Everything centered around her feeling comfortable and what she was going through - tiresome."
4,Very entertaining. A different kind of love story.,Benilde Little has written a different kind of love story. The drama was more than entertaining. I enjoyed reading it and recommend this novel to the bookclubs that have yet to read and enjoy Little's style. The title is deceiving at first but holds a lot of symbolism.
4,"Good Hair is good, light reading","The term 'good hair' makes me cringe as I still hear it more often than I think I should. I wasn't sure I would be able to stomach this book but the title is misleading.It is about much more than the battle between the straight and the nappy. It touches on the ever growing schism between the black upper and middle classes and those who are struggling not to fall through the cracks. It is about what happens when the rising nouveau black middle class meets the 'generations old' bourgeoisie. There is conflict, pretending, snobbery and insecurity from all sides as a modern couple tries to bridge the gap.This is a quick read which gives all of us something to think about."
4,Great and Easy Reading,"Good Hair truly represents todays middle class African Americans. It reminded me of Spike Lee's School Daze and the conflicts we as blacks have between us. Alice Andrews the main character of the book is the ideal today's black woman, struggling with career, family and especially a relationship. And when she finally meets Mr. Right (Jack Russworm) who is from a prominent family, you are guaranteed a roller coaster romance. I could truly relate to all the stereotypes made and of course the ""name dropping game"". I am also glad to see that this wasn't a male bashing book so the men should enjoy this as well."
3,Emotionally Detached,"This book was nicely written, but there was this sense of emotional detachment that plagued it. It felt techinally written--as though it is a list of what happens. I can't get a sense of Alice as a character because she is formed by thoughts only, not feelings.Her brother's sexual abuse of her and his subsequent suicide should've been more explored and definitely should've affected her more. And the part about Jack sleeping with someone else--what was the point of that? They got married in the end, anyway, which seemed tacked on for the purpose of a happy ending. Jack gets another woman pregnant, his view (and Alice's) about class seem unresovled, yet they're getting married? And Alice is still affected by Most of all this ending seems unrealistic beause I couldn't get a sense of them loving each other. They still seemed caught in the dating stage. I didn't expect them to be Harlequinesque, but some of that loving feeling should've been involved."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. The beginning was so great. The ending was a major disappointment. I thought that the character development was lacking. Also I felt she ended this book in this way to build to her next book ""The Itch"" which I also read and was disappointed in. I agree with another reviewer who said that Jack was forgiven because of his status...no amount of roses could right that wrong. I could have never trusted him again!"
4,A Fabulous Read,"I am one who has trouble finding good books to read, and was also captivated by this novel by the first couple of pages. I finished this novel on a series of plane rides home and found myself pondering over the many issues discussed in the novel in my journal afterwards. This novel touches on the division of the black race, and the consequences of that division. I ...would highly recommend this novel as a fabulous read. It puts you on a mini emotional roller coaster. You may find yourself laughing one minute, and then crying the next...all the while learning life lessons from Alice, the main character. Take a chance, and dare to enjoy!"
4,Good clipper at a good price,"I bought this clipper to clip my 31 year old mare. She gets very shaggy in the winter and no longer sheds off in the spring. My smaller battery operated clippers were overwhelmed, and my ANCIENT Sunbeam clippers finally gave out. These clippers did a good job. Since her hair grows with many cow licks, twists and turns, I still have to sort of work at it. I was happy with them though. They are not too heavy and do not get hot. I think they are a very good value. They seem sturdy and have a good feel to them. They are not too noisy. The only negative - i could not get the plastic attachment to trim her hair longer to work. Just set the blade to trim longer, and that's ok."
3,minor works by a major artist,"Art critic E.M. Benson is quoted in the introduction of this book saying ""I never saw an O'Keeffe that reminded me of anything but O'Keeffe"", and the pieces selected for this book, though most of them are minor, early works, are an indication of how her talent would develop, with her unique vision and terrific sense of color.As is stated in Barbara Haskell's text, they ""provide valuable insight into the origins of her vocabulary and basic approach to art"".The illustrations include eleven watercolors reproduced in black and white, from 1916-1934, a monotype from 1917, twentyfour color plates of watercolors from 1915-1922, and ten pieces from later years, mostly pastels and drawings, from 1925-1977.With good quality paper and fine color reproduction in a semi-gloss finish, this is recommended for art students, as it is always interesting to see the promise of early works, and die-hard O'Keefe fans."
5,excellent reflective devotional,"For anyone not familier with his music, this book will be an excellent introduction into a true wordsmith. Card is able to give insight into the life of Christ, born of a deep faith, and enhanced through a study of the Word. The words to the songs are followed by stories, either fictional reflections of ""might have been,"" or personal refelctions from his own life, which give the reader a place to begin reflection on his own faith, and it application to life."
3,"Good Tunes, Bad Skits","My one year old son loves the song ""Put Down the Duckie"" so much that we sing it in the tub. (I sing; he holds up the duckie.) There were other very entertaining musical performances on the video as well.The skits on the other hand were absolutely pointless. (Sorry, Phil.) I disliked that Grover Waiter skit even when I was a kid, and the Thirty-Nine Stairs is almost painful to watch even in fastfoward."
5,My son loves the duckie!,"This is the only DVD with the entire Put Down the Duckie song. Other Sesame Street DVDS have parts of the song, but this is the only one with the whole thing. My two year old son loves dancing and singing to the duckie, and many of the other songs."
3,Sesame Street for grownups,"I personally enjoyed this video very much - but I can't say the same for my toddler. It's a collection of celebrity clips and most of the humor is directed at adults, rather than kids. Celebrities include Phil Donahue, Ralph Nader, Martina Navritalova, Barbara Walters, Paul Simon, and Jane Curtin, to name a few.Unfortunately, these were all cameos - the celebrity songs you get on Sesame Street where a celebrity sings a song all the way through just doesn't happen. There is one clip of Grover as a waiter that used to be a running gag on Sesame Street - but since it stands alone, my toddler didn't think it was funny. There's some cute stuff here, but, really, it's not that much fun for kids.It's worth getting for yourself, though. Funny to see how much Barbara Walters and Ralph Nader have changed!"
2,Not worth the money,"I just got this in the mail today. I was thrilled and excited to put it in, especially after all the great reviews.One word to sum it up: eh.The first few minutes of the DVD is all introductory stuff. Almost like you're watching the previews waiting for it to start, but it's part of the video. So that made it even shorter than the description because it was just people talking. Not really many characters.The Put Down the Duckie song gets 2 stars. The rest of the footage doesn't even get any stars. Yes there are a few random old-school skits. But when I say a few, I mean VERY few. Like, 2? And I would think they could have chosen better ones...I watched the whole thing, sort of with out emotion, and then it abruptly was over. And you're watching like ""It's OVER? That's IT?""If it was longer, or less money, I would have given it more stars. But for $12, there was definitely not enough quality footage and not nearly enough material to make it worth it.I am sorry I bought this."
4,grimey-ville,"Poor A/V quality. Besides the amateurish acting and directing, this movie actual has a pretty good script. Grimey flick that I wish would added another 10 minutes worth of dialogue to showcase more of the game between pimps and hoes. But if you wish to learn more about their POV, get you coat pulled."
3,Nice lamp but cannot clamp to a vertical surface.,"Verilux Original Natural Spectrum Deluxe Clamp Lamp, GraphiteThe lamp appears to be very good, though the inability to dim the light other than switching between 2 fairly high fixed levels is a minus. My main problem with it is that the the ad says it will attach to a 'flat surface', but the supplied clamp will only attach to a flat horizontal surface like a table and not to a flat vertical surface like the headboard of a bed. Can't review it further because I can't use it in the place I need it."
3,"Good, but not a craft lamp","This lamp provides good light, but no better than that of several competitors. However, be aware that it is not a craft lamp (it popped up as such in my search in Amazon), in the sense that it does not have a magnifier."
2,"Poor Brightness, but Cute","I purchased the Verilux book light based on previous customer reviews, but it did not performance did not match the reviews. I wanted to read in bed, yet the brightness is not adequite without additional background light which is what I was trying to avoid. On ther plus side, it is a great night light."
2,Verilux Book Light not reccommended,"I read the reviews and bought it anyway. I wanted a little extra full-spectrum portable light at work, and it does provide that, but don't touch it or it falls apart. I am keeping it to clip on my computer screen at work but don't recommemd it, especially to someone who wants to clip it to a book!"
4,purchased 2 for my twin granddaughters,"I have two 7 year old twin granddaughters...who love to read, especially before going to bed at night. When they spent the night at my home, I saw them using a flashlight to read. I wanted them to have the best natural light to read and purchased the verilux natural spectrum book light and had it mailed to their home. They have been using it for over a month and both of them enjoy it very much. They need to be shown how to use it the first time and to be gentle with bending it and moving it. I believe this was a great purchase and well worth the money."
4,Amazon Rocks!,"The Verilux lamp is terrific. It is clear, bright, and has two convenient brightness settings. Unfortunatly the one I received died after less than a month. Amazon replaced it immediately, without a problem!!! Amazon rocks! Thank you Amazon."
1,Dim Light,"Nice design, but the light output is nowhere near the 100 - 150 watt output claimed, it is barely as bright as a 13 watt fluorescent bulb.I ordered a replacement light from Amazon thinking the first was faulty, the light output is the same, so now my dilemma is buy or return both."
5,Excellent reading light,"White light with effective clamps... I used to buy only Ott-Lite, but I discovered that Verilux is a very good alternative."
1,"Bad product, doesn't light up anything","I bought this on a whim. First and last product I buy without reading reviews first. Waste of money.It is so freaking uncomfortable to attack to the book, and the light it gives off is not uniform at all, and its not even strong. It feel like cheap quality.Don't buy it."
5,"Good value, powerful product","This is the most powerful vitamin C around, plus it is non-GMO, which means no stomach aches for me. I put it into capsules to protect tooth enamel. This seller, allhealthtrends, is great -- shipped stunningly quickly, at no extra cost."
3,Not for everyone.,My friend recommended this powder to me.It was good try but I don't know it worked for me.Size was too big and little pricy.It might be better to take a lemon instead of this.
1,Speaker are terrible don't believe these made up reviews....,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
4,Really Works!,"It really works! It stinks to high heaven and the cat was hesitant at first, but it really did calm her down. The bottle goes a long way, too. I would recommend"
2,It does stink,The smell of this product is enough to prevent us from using it. Our cats are resistant enough to odorless products that's I'm sure they'd be repelled by this.
2,Soaring low,"2 1/2Introducing themselves with a somewhat hypnotic, more organic sound than what further fractured outings would yield, FPA's debut nonetheless falls flat over the course of five lengthy tracks which more often than not stalls out in vacant repetition."
3,Little Book!,"This is a cute book and I wanted it for my Toddler niece and I'm sure she will enjoy it but just a warning to those who don't realize that this is a smaller book. I thought it would be the size of a regular coloring/reading book but in fact, it's smaller! It's still a cute book and a good read for little ones but you could get something else at the dollar store!"
4,Zoinks!,"My 4 year old likes it, she loves Scooby Doo shows, so I'm happy with the book. I like the flash cards at the end, nice touch."
1,I want my money back,"This lock jammed the first time I used it. It took me at least ten minutes to get it to open. Even when it doesn't jam, this lock is a pain to open and close because of the angle of the locking mechanism.I bought this lock at Target because it's what they had. I should have looked at reviews before purchasing."
1,1 star b/c you can't enter 0,"My almost 3 year old son and I rode our bikes to library today and we had to walk home because this POS would not open. I know I didn't foget the combo (it is the house number I lived in for the first 22 years of my life). The (deleted) thing is holding my son's bike hostage at the library--I wonder how long it will be before the library cuts it loose and the bikes are gone for good?! Yes, I am ranting, but this lock has my kid's bike and I am pissed!!!"
1,Horrendous. Buy some other lock.,"It broke after about a month-- it won't open, so my bike is now locked to my back porch. Utterly useless!"
1,Lock jammed,I bought this bike lock to use in our carport on Tuesday. Worked fine until Thursday when my son was re-locking the lock it jammed and will not come apart. I wish I knew what these thieves use to cut the cable with b/c now I have two bikes cabled together. When I get the cable cut I am returning it and will not buy another. I can't get a real person on the phone at PTI Sports (who manufactures it & uses Schwinn's name). Do not buy this product.
1,"I got a defective one, and paid dearly for it!","I bought this lock, set a combination, and used it approximately three times until one day while my bike was locked outside the gym it suddenly wouldn't open with the right combo!!! I struggled with it, walked home (thankfully I don't live that far away) watched some youtube videos on how to open one of these without knowing the combo, still no use. The lock must have internally broken, or somehow the combo changing ring got turned before I locked it (unlikely because it's pretty hard to turn). I ended up having to borrow someone's large wire cutter and it took me about 3 minutes to cut through the wire. What a pile of garbage! Stay away, you might get a ""lucky"" one like me!"
1,One star is too too much!,"I had this working for a week. One day I went to unlock the bike to ride to the store from my house and the lock was jammed. I tried WD-40, a lighter, a flathead screwdriver a hammer and my foot. It's been two days now and I'm borrowing a lock cutter from my campus security to free my bike and threw this POS away! What a WASTE! I too should have read the reviews but I needed a lock. I had to get a U-lock on my bike to prevent anyone from stealing the bike while this lock was on it!!!!"
2,Gen. Bernard Montgomery was a fraud,"Gen. Bernard Montgomery did one thing during World War II. He ""defeated"" Erwin Rommel at El Alemain, in North Africa. From that point on, he never succeeded in any battle that he fought. Winston Churchill regarded him as a brilliant tactician. But in reality, he couldn't shine George Patton's shoes.What he cost the Allies during his Market Garden campaign were thousands of lives. His ego was so inflated that he regarded himself as ""invincible"". Montgomery was a clown that performed in Europe, nothing more.The author was British. Need I say more?"
2,An All Arabic Grammar Book that is Too Basic!,"Intermediate in vocabulary but basic in style and grammar. Save one page, does no analysis on style past the sentence level. Most of the book is spent on tense, and little time is given to finer points of explanation. Most of the exercises consist of repeating in writing what the book has already written. There are annoying typos and unhelpful repetition abounds. There are no contextual examples.I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone. Spend some real time with the Al-Kitaab series or read Ryding's Arabic grammar reference for grammar"
2,Good pictures but pook texts,"Dear Sirs,You can find very good pictures of some tribes all over the world but texts are very poor. As I mentioned there are some tribes but where are others? It was a disappointment for me because I couldn't find a lot of tribes from Africa and Asia which I hoped to find. Therefore I would recommend to find other books in tribes if you are looking for real book and information in it."
1,This is price gouging at its worst!,I don't understand why anyone would charge over $200 for a Bible. Readers may want to see Upper Room's website <http://www.upperroom.org/bookstore/search_page.asp> to pay a more reasonable price. The Bible itself is wonderful for those interested in spiritual formation and living a more Holy life.
5,Travel Companion Extraordinaire!,"I bought this guy with my Twin Sister in 2003. He came with me to University, my first apartment, and back home to my parent's house, in one piece. Olie (my name for him) is still cuddly and soft, even with his being stuffed in my purse, backpack, travel bags and coat pocket numerous times over the years.Little cousins love him, and so do I!He balances on your head nicely. ;)I'd recommend this little guy to anyone! He's awesome.I've since bought a few other critters from the same line, and they're all awesome, but none are as lovely as my little Oliphant, Winks!"
3,Doesn't Look like Picture,I was disappointed when I received this because it doesn't look like the picture. It's thinner than I thought (thought it would be fluffier) and a much darker color than the photo.
4,nice and it was bigger than i thought it would be,i bought several of these in different animals and i loved them . they were so cute and actually bigger than i thought they would be which is great .. cute perfect for the crib since your not supposed to put large stuffed animals in the crib for fear of smuthering ..
3,not what we expected,"I bought this for my daughter to replace one that she had chewed the nose off of. I thought I had found a great deal when I found them on here, and ordered two. I'm guessing that they changed the style since the 2002 edition though, because it was a little different. It has totally different material than the TyLux on the 2002 one. My daughter doesn't like it all because of this. That is the only reason I gave it the low score."
5,Adorable,"When we chose to name our daughter Ella, my mother-in-law quickly connected her name to Elephant, and it quickly became her animal. This was the first plush I ever bought her to anticipate her arrival and it has held up to this day, 4 years now. It has been machine washed quitea few times and remains as soft and adorable as day one. Defiitly a favorite around here!"
1,The Author Forgot Something,"Frank and Joe help the owner of a local animal/amusement park and the owner of a blimp manufacturing company when unknown enemies threaten to ruin their businesses. Mr. Hardy tracks down a terrorist group. I think the author forgot to include something in this book, like a plot. The book doesn't really seem to be about all that much. What story there is, is incredibly boring and terribly unoriginal. The book is lacking in both action and excitement. Only about 2 or 3 of the chapter endings made me want to read more and I found that I wanted to get through the book only to be finished with it. The title of the book is not very appropriate. The terrorist group is called the Scorpio gang, but they could have been called the Barbie doll gang with little rewriting of the story. The whole book is uninteresting, don't waste your time reading it."
1,Run out of gas,"I always thought that from Volume #36 on, the writers had run out of gas. They cranked out only a few good books after 1956's The Secret of Pirates Hill. The Sting of The Scorpion was no exception. It was certainly not the worst in the set but it is down there. I think by that point, the essence of what the Hardy Boys were had been lost."
1,Boring,"This book indeed ranks among the worst in the series and gets my vote for one of the 10 worst. It has none of what we expect from the Hardy Boys. There is no suspense, no adventure and very little mystery. At least the brothers are in around Bayport for a change. The volume was lackluster. The artwork was disgusting. The cliff hangers had little to do with the mystery. RATED F"
4,"Good Product, bad packaging",Love the product but my past two orders have come damaged where the product had seeped out all over the box. Have had a hard time getting return issues resolved as sometimes Amazon says return product and then I get a message not to return the product but have yet to see a credit for damaged product!
3,shipping problems,"I ordered this and received a half empty bottle - it didn't leak in the packing box but leaked inside the product box, meaning it had already happened before being shipped. Amazon agreed to replace it, but the second bottle was completely empty. I hope this problem has been resolved!!!!!!"
4,Over 50!,"Love it! I'm over 50, and I have a good deal of sun damage spots. When I use this stuff, even once a day in the morning, I notice the spots are much lighter after about a week. All of the Mychelle products are good, they free of ingredients you can't understand, they are potent, and anyone who complains about the prices has not been to Macy's lately and tried to buy a real natural product.Update: 2/16/11 I'm not sure what's going on with this product, but somehow the formula is now different. It use to be mostly clear with a yellow tint, adn had a slightly skunky smell. I liked it because it seemed very natural and authentic, with lots of vitamin C. Now it looks sort of thicker with an egg yolk-type consistency, and the smell is weird, like they reduced the strength and tried to cover up the smell. Maybe some dummies complained. I'm definitely not as five star happy with it as I used to be, and I don't think it works as well."
3,Wanted to like it...,"I wanted to like this product!! I'd read so many consistently good reviews about this serum that I thought it would be a sure-fire winner. The only negatives I'd read were that the packaging was poorly designed. In the end, I think it probably IS a decent product, but the INCREDIBLY poor design of the packaging outweighs the benefits of the serum. Also, the bottle is just too small, especially for the cost. I probably won't buy this again."
2,"Well, it WAS perfect...","I started using this serum about a year and a half ago and it really seemed to help control my acne. There were a couple of times when I ran out and, while waiting for the next bottle to arrive, my skin would flare up. However, it seems that the formula changed and I now get allergic bumps all over my forehead when I use it. Other MyChelle products (MyChelle White Cranberry Cleanser, 4.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)andMyChelle Clear Skin Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle) still work great for my sensitive skin, but be wary of this one."
3,"great product, terrible bottle","I love this serum. It cleared up dark spots and swollen sun spots in about 1week from recently being in the sun. The pump did not work after a few days, it got clogged and then I had to open it every time and dab some on my fingers to apply, which is really annoying."
2,Not Impressed,"I had high hopes for this product. I received a sample which seemed to be helping my tired, congested skin, so I thought I'd go ahead and order a full bottle of it. I had read so many great things about it that I was sure that it would create some visible results in my skin. Sadly, this serum did nothing for me. What other reviewers said about the pump and packaging is true. It does tend to waste and leak. The smell is sort of strange and it lingers on your hands even after you wash them, which is rather annoying. I guess it just doesn't work for my skin, which is a bummer."
5,A great thing to do for your skin!,This skin serum is wonderful!I would never of used a serum product if it wasnt for this one!
5,Wonderful Potion,"This stuff stops my hormonal acne in its tracks. I use several MyChelle products and I love them all. For those who say it's expensive... what about the department store, ""upscale"" brands? They can cost far more than this and I have never seen the amazing positive changes in my skin that I have seen using MyChelle. It's comforting to know that MyChelle is also a socially responsible company looking to help people (and animals!) and create effective products free of potentially harmful ingredients. What's not to love?"
4,Good but expensive,"This is half an ounce of vitamin C. I think compared to the one I used previously, Ole Henricksen truth serum, this is rather expensive.I've been using it for a month and I can't tell what it does for my skin. The pump is horrible because it just drips on my fingers and waste products. While the product feels nice and absorb quickly, I'm not sure if I would buy it again due to the price. I might end up buying it again because they have a good percentage of vitamin C and no fillers."
2,blah,ok. it did sting a little when I put it on. but for the most part it made my just washed face feel dirty. real disappointed with this entire line of skin care
5,What a bargain,Great product. Superb price! I got a king size bed and flannel is the only way to go during winter. I just couldn't pass up $15 for a king size set!! I love the colors I got and the sheets are excellent quality. You just cannot go wrong with this product at the price of $15.
5,Very pleased with this sheet set!,"This was a great buy - no doubt about it. The color is fantastic - it is a deep, rich, brick red color -not at all cranberry colored as I feared. It has a nice hem stitched looking detail on the pillow cases and the flat sheet. It is a heavy flannel, but not at all too warm to sleep in - I would say this is because it is 100% cotton. I have washed mine twice and they are fine. I got the King size set. My friends could not believe how little this sheet set cost! Fantastic!"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the initial quality of this comforter by Wamsutta. It did not seem to be of high quality: it felt rather brittle and not soft or luxurious in texture and the color did not look warm and inviting as it did in the Amazon.com photos. I almost want to return it.
1,"Cheap, Cheap and Cheap","I purchased these sheets and they were not only very thin, they left lint like crazy. It was every where, balls of it rolling, on my face, up my noset, etc. and I could never remove all of it no matter how hard I tried. Save your money and purchase a better set!"
1,Cal-King labled King....,We ordered this set and the drop down menu listed all the standarde sizes. We ordered what we have which is a King. Cal-King is not even listed as an option but we were sent a Cal-King. There is a huge difference between the two. Very disappointed. Selling to a friend with a Cal-King. Not cool! Beware.
3,QUIRKY,"The movie runs about 6 subplots making things a bit confusing. I felt like I was watching pieces of a half dozen different movies. The film starts out with an electronic bank robbery attempt, some welfare slackers, an assassin killing a man, undercover cops, the computer hacker helping a criminal, and a rich man being told his wife is having an affair..I think that is most of it.The subplots start to come together, some through a case of mistaken identity and errors. The plot was enjoyable as was most of the actors. The manner in which it was directed and weak sound track kept it from becoming a classic. This is for those who like a quirky movie.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,"All Cons, no Pros!","This is a badly made film - bad story/plot, bad set, bad makeup, bad acting, bad and boring from the very beginning to the very end. A low budget film doesn't have to be this boring, at least for God's sake not at the very beginning, but this one disappoints from the very beginning..."
1,1 minute movie,"After the first minutes of the movie you will realize it is the waste of money.This is a cheap movie like those filmed in Hawaii or Florida.Poor acting. Bad music. Bad sound. Actors look like never been filmed before.The ""hacker"" fits xbox player's profile, not a computer geek.You can make better movies with your iPhone.I had to give at least 1 star, but really this movie deserves ""1 alert""This move goes in trashcan with theAirline Disaster"
3,"so,","I agree with the review above this one. I myself bought it just because it's Placebo-related and Placebo stuff are sort of rare, especially in the States. I had no high hopes for this DVD, so when I finally watched it, I wasn't too disappointed. Almost all of the ""new"" pictures are floating around the internet somewhere and very loyal fans probably already have said pictures taped on their walls. The interviews were somewhat amusing, but provided little to no new information on the band.Mostly, you should decided if you want to buy it or not. I bought because I'm a fan of Placebo and knew that the DVD would turn out crappy.If you're a new fan then you should buy the DVD, especially their other one, Once More With Feeling. You'll get a head start on pictures and grab a few fun facts about Placebo along the way.Also, I'm kind of infuriated that they only had a picture of Brian Molko (frontman) on the DVD cover. It's a band, so where are Stefan and Steve?!"
4,Memories,"Bought this CD because I love the songs ""Mash Potatoes"" and ""I Really Love You."" It just brought back the times when these records were played at our School dances in the gym. Then Viet Nam came and we gals found ourselves dancing to ""I Really Love You"" one more time. After that, we graduated and found there were no guys to dance with, all were taken to war. It was a time of inocence But, its still a nice CD full of memories."
5,A Performance Worth Having,"The main reason I purchased this video was for the collection I am making for all Tatiana Troyanos' work. She died of ovarian cancer in 1993 and is greatly missed. Her artistry should be held up along with Enrico Caruso, Maria Callas and Luciano Pavarotti."
1,BORING!!!!,"LA CLEMENZA DI TITO is one of my very favorite operas, and I have 4 on dvd. Alas, this one is my least favorite, and I was extremely disappointed with it. The singing is fine, but the acting is so static and uninvolved, that I had a hard time focusing on the story or caring about the characters. I knew after viewing it for the first time, I'd never watch it it again. For that reason I sold it for store credit at one of my favorite used bookstores. Maybe if you're a big fan of any of the singers you'll want this in your collection. However, if you're a fan of the opera, this is definitely NOT a first or even second choice."
4,Somewhat silly production,I like most of Ponelle's opera films including this one. Voices all first-rate and the music fantastic. While interesting I found the use of the Roman ruins as the stage strange especially when their costumes were 16th century. Freeing the actor from singing resulted in melodramatic gestures and facial expressions and the zoom outs the length of a football field with the actor singing was a little silly. This opera has two trouser roles which is a little disconcerting; I guess it is hard to find men with soprano voices any more.
5,"Haven't read the book yet, but I took Dave Thau's class","Dave Thau is amazing. I am dying to get this book. I took his JavaScript class in San Francisco and he managed to make the subject not only easy to learn, but fun! I had some previous programming classes and came away confused and frustrated at the inability of my instructors to convey the basic principles involved. In Dave's class I learned not only all the basic principles of programming, but how to execute them successfully using JavaScript. Invaluable. If this book is anything like his classes you can't pass it up."
2,Just another Cookbook!,"I don't know what all the hype is about in regards to THAU!'s book as being so great. It is not. It is just another Cookbook posing as instruction, with all kinds of typos and code that just doesn't work all only written moderately well. To my knowledge there is no single book I can recommend to anyone who wants to learn JavaScript from the ground up. Every book I have read leaves out huge relevant chunks of information except O'Reily's book but it is mega over kill in detail. So Mr Thau!'s book will be added to the pile of books I own on JavaScript. Maybe Mr.McClennen will take up JavaScript and write about it!?Brice Bowman"
4,"overall, a very good book.","This book was very good for what it was intended to be, a gateway into javascript. Ofcourse one will not find every detail of javascript in this book. It was designed for the newbie.Every topic was well written and easily understood. The only problem I had with it was the part about functions. Using this as my first real programming language, I didn't know the fundamentals. The book did not describe how functions worked very well, hence why I have it a rating of a 4 and not a 5. It was not untill I learned some c++ that i understood functions and was able to come back and relearn all the javascript.all in all the book was VERY good and I HIGHLY recomend it to any newbie to javascript or to programming. (ofcourse javascript requires a good understanding of html Before you learn javascript, that was my disclaimer incase and real newbies were reading."
2,Just another cut and paste book,"How many times must I be fooled by online reviews and buy another useless javascript book? I already sold this thing on ebay , couldn't stand the sight of it after the first three chapters. Just a bunch of recycled material from the WebMonkey site. trust me on this one, Don't do it! stick to the free tutorials on the web, 10x better, and, well, free!"
1,Poor quality,"This book is of such poor quality that beginners are better off skipping it altogether, to avoid even getting familiar with outdated and harmful practices. Only looking at a section on form validation, one could find a dozen of mistakes. Figure 11-2, being only 60 lines, is a mix of bad markup and poor code.1) No doctype2) Ancient, unnecessary html comments in scripts3) Non-standard form access4) Inefficient property access in a loop (`loop < window.document.the_form.gender.length`)5) `if (<...>.checked == true)`6) rad_select = ""no""/""yes"", not boolean, name not descriptive7) unnecessary global variable in onSubmit, attribute name is of mixed case8) html is not valid (form contains inline elements)9) No corresponding labels or titles on form controls, inaccessible10) Mix of camelcase and underscores"
5,Still Great After All These Years,"Okay I admit it, I never really outgrew Sesame Street and I have bought numerous DVDs for my children. All these years later, they still have the ability to enthrall children.And of course for adults it brings back many memories of childhood as you revisit some things you have not seen in quite awhile.Of course the songs remain in your head, and after you hear C is For Cookie a few times, you may find yourself humming it now and again, and you can always tell who has young children if they hear you humming it and give you a knowing smile :)All in all, you cannot go wrong with Sesame Street videos."
5,Excellent,Filled with great songs. Our 1 year old loves it! All songs are performed by the monsters themselves.
4,an alternative sort of mystery,"This is a very intriguing sort of murder mystery. It has a great deal of subtlety to it, unfolds generally at a leisurely pace, and gives a great sense of the main character's strengths and weaknesses. It also gives a great sense of the French countryside."
2,A French Country Murder,"A book in desperate need of an editor! In the end it lost me and I tried, I really tried. The plot started with the central character falling out with a colleague in the CIA. {Possible, not a problem there} And in despair he lands at Charles de Gaulle Airport north of Paris and from there walks to Spain and half way back again. The Author might have done his case some good if he had actually visited CDG or Paris. I do believe he visited the Village in the Loire, but Mr Steiner France isnt that small. Paris to San Sebastien on foot is considerably further than Chicago to Jackson Mississippi! If you want a good detective story with the flavour and aromas of France, tuck into the Bruno series by Martin Walker, or The Adamsberg series by Fred Vargas, [who is French but well translated into English]."
5,The Best Thriller of the Year,"Peter Steiner's new book is a tightly written, suspenseful political and psycholgical thriller that keeps one ""hooked"" to the end. Peter's concise writing style and great ability to select exactly the right word to express detail give one a greater appreciation of his gift as a writer. It rises above other books of the genre because of the fully developed characters and Peter's wonderful ability to convey his love for France and the French countryside. Additionally, it is informative about French history, customs, and culture. I highly recommend anyone's sitting down with this captivating book for a sophisticated thrill and vicarious journey to France."
4,Pretty good plot,"A little different from the norm with the ""retired spook"" angle. I will probably look for some by this author."
2,French country murder,"There is too much writing and too little plot ,which,in itself, is preposterous. Inspector Bruno mysteries by Martin Walker are far better if one wants to read about French countryside."
4,Caution,"Caution! These cryptograms were pulled from another puzzle book called ""Puzzles for a Super-Mind Workout."" I'm in the midst of doing these very same puzzles from the other book. These are the exact same puzzles with another title.Oh yes, the cryptograms are great--funny, interesting, quotable. You'll enjoy. Just don't buy this book if you've done the ones from the other book."
4,Fun crypto-grams,"I really like the spiral-bound cryptogram books. The pages are a really good size and the hints are great. I am not the best at solving them but they certainly work out your mind. I am particular about the paper quality and the paper used in the spiral-bound ones are perfect. If you'd like to try cryptogram puzzles, this is a good one to buy."
3,A picture to match the music,"A worthwhile and interesting book. It is a most useful thing is to put a face on the names that are so well known, and to see how different the great masters were, not only musically, but physically. The only unfortunate thing is that there are only a one picture of each, could have been interesting to see some younger pictures, a greater variety, etc. of some of the more famous names."
3,Great Story---end confusing,This is a great movie but I have to agree that the story sometimes is hard to understand because of the English accent. Also the end was disappointing as we just didn't understand what transpired at all. That's why the 3 stars instead of five.Good though.
4,A Tale of Character and Strength,"The War Bride takes place in England circa the middle of WWII and in Canada. Two Canadian soldiers woo some seamstresses and marry them quickly, offereing them a way to escape war-torn England by emigrating to Canada. Many years elaspse, and the fate of each girl takes a different turn before being reunited with their new husbands.One soldier misrepesents his wealth and family such that the wife arrives unwelcome in a remote and unfriendly rural farm. This story details her efforts to adjust to this new way of life and try to fit in. She is a compelling character and the acting is excellent.A well done tale and worth seeing."
4,"For the Mac, best out there for amateurs!","Pros: easy-to-use, templates for quick pagesCons: not as feature-rich as some PC productsOverall 4Features 3Learning Curve 5Price-Value 5For the price and platform, you simply could not do any better! The application is easy to understand and you can create a page in minutes (or even seconds?!) Version 2.0 adds gradients, patterns, buttons, brads and more. Save money on photo processing, supplies and tools - opt for this MAC platform product."
4,Really great for the price.,"I was quite impressed with iRemember. It does more than I thought it would. What is really cool, is that you can take a picture and use it as a background by zooming and making it fade. It has quite a range for opaque and tramsparent manipulating. I haven't discovered all it can do yet but I am having fun with it. I highly recommend it."
4,Great product... now I just need more time...,"I haven't had a lot of time to create a bunch of pages yet, but I have enjoyed what I've done with this software so far. I was able to download some free scrapbook templates from the internet and import them and create some easy pages for our daughter's scrapbook.I've tried my hand at regular scrapbooking but it took forever to do a single page and all the papers, stamps, scissors, etc. took up so much room in the house that I simply didn't have. Now, all I need is my laptop, my bunny slippers and a cup of hot chocolate and I'm ready to start working on all the scrapbook pages I want.There are a few features that aren't quite as easy as I'd like. (I'd LOVE to have a layers palette like Photoshop has.) Despite these few snags it's really a pretty easy program to learn and fun to use."
1,Not easy to use,"I have recently switched over from PC to Mac. I have been digital scrapbooking on windows for years. I also use Photoshop Elements and bought that as well. I think this IRemember software was a waste of money. It does not come with any user manual only online help. The online tutorial is for using a template that is already made not a custom scrapbook page. I have been working at this for about 5 hours in total and still don't have one page done. This software is NOT user friendly. I even sent an email today looking for a user guide and got a system error when trying to send the emal from there contact us link.I wouldn't spend the money on this again. Your better off with photoshop elements because that is actually easier to use than this software. I will probably look around for something further for the clip art but am disappointed that I wasted the money on this. Also, I am a software QA analyst."
4,Helpful software that allowed me to create a terrific photo book,I purchased this software to help me create a photo memory book for my child's class. It was pretty easy to learn and the end product was wonderful. I think it is well worth the price to create a very professional looking end product.
2,Disappointed,"Having used other digital scrapbooking programs for a PC, I was really excited to try this one for our new iMac. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. I am extremely disappointed in the templates and the graphics/backgrounds that are available. The pages look cartoonish and overly simplistic -- not at all what I could create using the other program I have for the PC. If this thing had a money back guarantee, I would get mine back!!"
2,Not worth the money!,"Just finished looking over the clip art, very limited. Seems like pages will be very amateurish!"
2,Try something else!!!!!,I have been wanting to scrapbook for so long so I decided to finally get something. Loving Mac computers I thought iRemember would be the best option. I was wrong!! I'm not great at computers but I am not completely stupid either and I had a very hard time with this. I made some very nice pages that I really liked but it took me so long to do it that I didn't enjoy it much. The clip art sounds like you would get a lot but all you get is a bunch of the same thing in every color imaginable. The layouts are really not that exciting I didn't want to use any of them. I wish I would have saved my money and waited for something better.
1,Ripped Off,"Don't waste your money. I bought this as a gift for my brother. There is no way I would give this as a gift to anyone. It is a piece of thick wire threaded at both ends, held together with a mating bolt. It doesn't even have a finish. It looks like it was lying around on a garage floor. What a piece of junk!"
3,sloppy editing works,"the knowledge and information shared in this book is useful but are too basic ones. plus, i have found two editing mistakes within my first 20 pages reading. on page 243, the abbreviation of ""cost per gross rating point"" should be read as CPGRP, rather than CGPRP. and on page 271, the second calculation of DM should be DM=$40,000/($30*0.05*0.75)=35,555 pieces, rather than just repeat the same one as above. quite disappointed with the editing quality."
3,"good for budget, better sets out there","I purchased my set on sale, and for the money (60.00) found it to be a good value. I measured the aluminum thickness 2.5mm vs 3.7mm on my Simply Calphalon pan. The nonstick surface is good quality, better than some of the cheaper sets I looked at. No nonstick cookware lasts forever, so I figured this hard anodized set was fine for now. Hard anodized really heats evenly but you have to hand wash them, so the owner is not likely to be too hard on this set. Calphalon makes a cleaner for hard anodized that keeps them looking like new. I wont feel bad if I buy a new set in a few years as this set is performing nicely in terms of cooking, just not very heavy. There are much heavier sets that go on sale all the time for approx. 100.00, so if faced with paying full price for this set I would hesitate. Good overall performance but only for a price point on a budget."
2,Warranty is A Joke,I bought the Wearever Cookware set and an additional Large stainless steel non-stick frying pan. I could have paid more but they had a lifetime guarantee and they were cheaper. I now know why they are cheaper! There warranty is a joke! You pay for shipping back to the manufacturer under their warranty and then they deny the claim due to heat. They ship it back to you. I will no longer due business with this company for weaseling out of their warranty. They also manufacture Mirror products. Pay the difference and get a set that lasts! This company is not worthy of your business unless you like over paying for under performing products!
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"This is a great book. If you are looking for a book on using the runes for magic this is the book. Great info on the runes along with keywords, color attributions and astrological connections.I have one critisism however, which in the end is not even that bad. As one reviewer mentions he gives body stances to enter into to better connect with the rune. From my time in magic I think he either missed this blind or knew of it and passed it on. One does not get into a physical position to invoke its power. Think more on an astral and mental level and you are close. If you use it in the section where you are training to use the rune after 10 minutes of visualizing in your minds eye your getting hotter. I won't cheat you out of the rest of the discovery.All in all a great book without loads of historical b.s. to contend with. I got what I needed and did not have to go through a history class to get it. Mucho kudos."
3,"Unfortunately, rather useless","In this customer's opinion, the problems with this book are:1) There is a lot of speculative free association and diversion from the original ""meaning"" of each rune. The existing poems (old English) are given, but the author's explanations are obviously from his own mill. I didn't like that.2) The comments on the runes are too often indistinguishable from each other. This kills the meaning and usefulness of the whole thing.3) The Yoga additions don't go with anything else an detract from the book. Same with the pseudo-Kabala tree.In sum, this book, and 'Runelore' by the same author, are a bit disappointing. Not too useful for the only purpose the runes can have today. People are interested in the runes for the mental exercise brought about by the divination (or soul-searching) game. Any esoteric meaning added arbitrarily to them can only take away from that experience.Better to work with other, less 'important' books and free online information."
4,I enjoy..,"I enjoy this a great deal it is a central rockin' freakin good work to many, a standard central text. i can't wait to learn about the German traditions Mr. Thorsson writes about. He is The leading expert on Germanic studies..So,so what..I like this..Can't we be ancient and do what our forefathers did? Carla at Runa Raven's always helpful..Runes a mighty..Stephen Flowers, aka Thorsson, is always helping, and decipHering for us lost manuscripts.. Ok? Love ya..This love is what I have for Thorsson's work."
3,"Worth reading, if you can follow it","This book first came out in the late 1980's, and many rune magicians still consider it a classic. Several later authors, including Gundarsson, have been inspired by _Futhark_ to some extent.Thorsson discusses the meanings and magical uses of each rune in detail, backing them with references from Norse pagan texts and Germanic folklore. He does occasionally allude to other esoteric traditions, but this doesn't feel as intrusive as it does in some other books. (My only complaint here is the table of astrological and Tarot correspondences at the end of the book; the runes, in my opinion, should be able to stand on their own as a magical system.)I would still recommend this book ten years after I first bought it, although Thorsson's language may be too dry and academic for popular readers."
4,Thorsson is one of the best authors of Runic study.,"Edred Thorsson doesn't create an aire of mystery and ""can't touch"" like so many others have. And he keeps his facts straight from one book to the other. Giving a concise history and explaination of the Runes, from their earliest uses and possible uses to the Third Reich in his other book, Rune Might. Definately, if you are interested in studying the Runes and don't want the flotsum of someone who doesn't have all the facts, then by all means, read his books. They give you practical understanding that goes beyond surface information"
4,A good foundation for runic study,"This book is a classic of runeology and an excellent primer for those interrested in rune magic. The translations and meanings are on target. The exercises are good, and explinations of rune magic make it understandable.However, Edred Thorsson has a rather dry, dull writing style that does make the good content difficult to follow at times, and it drags."
3,Runic Knowledge,"A decent and informative but rather dry book about the Runes. Lots of scholarly material here, but all used in view of practicing runic magick. What is ancient lore and what are new ideas is not seperated very clearly, but it provides a solid basis for any pagans interested in the sibject."
5,Understandable,"Very well written, this book covers alot of ground and explains everything very well. I am very pleased with the depth of the material and the readability. Highly credible."
4,A good book,"Very informative. Basic and to the point. Easy to grasp and understand. Information regarding the runic cosmology and ""soul"" very intriguing."
3,"Question, Not a Review",It indicates that the title is being released in July of 2012. Is there any indication of revisions? Additions? Deletions? in this release?Thank you in advance for any information.
5,dope !!!!!!,this a very dope taste of g funk 94 tape only from Big Meech .Get it if you can when you find it!!!!
1,Requires Deadheads to like it,"Awful. Violent. Tawdry. Pointless. Smutty. In an attempt at 'realism', this series is a serious parody of itself. Wouldn't watch any of it again on a dare."
3,An alright series,Definately over 18 material. Keeps your attention and one show rolls into the next wheich I like alot. It doesn't jump around any that I saw from the first season. It is somewhat dry in the plot or action area. Alot of that you see is expected but it's a account of day to day life in a lawless gold mining town of the old west. Times were different and maybe things moved a little slower. Its good to pass the time with and definatley worth the money
1,deadwood,"i wrote you four times and no responsewe never received our order?????a e-mail came to us that you were sorry and would ship it out asap two weeks ago, and still no order??????"
1,profanity obscured the content,"We had recently purchased Hell on Wheels and loved it. Amazon recommended Deadwood based on our purchase of Hell on Wheels. We sat through about 5 minutes of dialogue. The profanity was so gratuitous, we gave up. That was $ down the drain."
5,Deadwood - The First Season,"David Milch's modern retelling of the Black Hills Gold Rush is as compelling as it is raw and realistic. On HBO, and not censored in any way as it would be on commercial television, it provides us with a more honest rendering of how human beings live and act. This first season you'll be shaking your head wondering if the crazed Gold Rush Days could have been so outrageous. Right off I compared it to Gunsmoke, a similar tale written and produced for television nearly a half century ago. I think we're seeing things more clearly today. I think our artists have more leeway and their audiences won't sit still for the kitschification of human experience."
2,doesn't stream to Apple TV via ipad,"Hopefully the content is great, but I may never know since playing the video from Amazon thru my iPad to my Apple TV results in ""audio only"" playback. This is apparently due to some licensing snafu with Amazon. I guess it's iTunes video for me from here on in (not a fan of watching movies on a handheld device at home)."
2,Laziness equals profanity,"Yes, this show is a fresh look at a tired typology, but it is evident that the profanity is an act of laziness and an attempt at constant shock value over real story-telling, I mean I understand the use of profanity now and again to suggest a greater reality, but this show just never stops, it's F-ing and C-ing all the live long day, which is a pity, because it was such a good idea, but hey, I suppose that's HBO's agenda, shock over substance, the two stars are for the high quality of acting by most of the actors, the lack of three stars is for the laziness and short-sightedness of the writers and producers. It could have been a classic!"
3,Cheezy,"I wanted to like this show. I gave it a chance.Honestly, this has some of the most unnatural dialog and mediocre acting on television. I'm not sure why there is so much unnecessary profanity - and more importantly - why its delivered so poorly. Every other word is an F-bomb or CS'er. Am I watching a gritty western or 1970's mobster movie? It's corny. Its almost as if each scene has a quota for the amount of profanities it needs - just when you think you've made it through a scene, somebody goes on a string of obscenities for no good reason. Wierd.The story (minus some poor actors) is actually pretty good. The film quality is great!"
1,DEADWOOD - Like it wasn't,"YIKES! Oh for the days of true dialogue and true history. I wish I had a job where I could just slack off, throw in a few hundred salty words and call it day. I'm tempted to send the producers of this series a Websters Dictionary, apparently they need help in the linguistic dept. The actor playing Preacher Smith is terrible and not historically accurate. Hickock was shot during a rather robust day in 1876 in Deadwood not amongst a few poker players as in this series. Calamity Jane needs a haircut - see pictures of her. Unimpressive and will probably get more awards. Scary! Just give me history. Why is the truth so hard to depict?I thought Hollywood had the greatest talent pool in the U.S. if not the world. Your telling me you can't depict the truth with palatable dialogue so everyone can enjoy the series...ok?"
1,Deadwood content,"The content of the Deadwood DVD lst season has so much FOUL LANGUAGE in it, I can't watch it. I would not have bought it had I known how BAD the language was. I love westerns but this was ridiculous!!!!"
1,Watch your language,"This may repeat what others have said, but DO NOT buy this series if you or the recipient will be offended by much too frequent use of the f word and other expletives. I ordered this for a brother in law who does not have internet access and he is really upset about the language and would like to return the product. But as one on DVD has been opened he would get 1/2 his money back. I do not know why the socalled entertainment industry has to go overboard on expletives, probably the writers have not matured over their teen age years."
1,Dead wood indeed,"Oh, why can I not give this zero stars? Any attempt at accurate historical portrayal here is overshadowed by the need to outshadow current Hollywood trends. Sure, there's enough swearing and sex to make it ""seem"" like the good ol' wild west, but that aside, the plots wear thin and trite. After one or two episodes, it's easy to spot that the title ""Deadwood"" is quite apt."
1,"Weak actors, mostly obscene dialog","Do you expect about sixty percent of everything said in a western to be obscene cursing? Well, it seems like the writers for this series either can't think of what the cast should actually say. Maybe they think people don't talk much other than to curse, and this means there's little space for a plot to develop. It's a pity, as this series otherwise could be good.The acting and scenery is okay, but not great."
3,Dense show,"The cast on this show is amazing, and I really tried to get into it, but I had trouble seeing what was going on sometimes due to it being filmed in a way that makes it look dark."
5,Deadwood,"I originally watched the Deadwood series when it was broadcast on HBO, then I watched it again through Netflix. Not only is the Deadwood series well written but the cast of characters and actors are brilliant. Everytime I watch an episode I pick up on something that I previously missed. I never get tired of watching it and am glad I purchased this series through Amazon. Now I can watch it anytime I want. BTW, if you liked the movie Tombstone you will love Deadwood."
5,when david milch starts a cult...,i'm joining. watch the bonus disc with the david milch interviews to see why.
5,Both sides are right,"Reading these reviews, almost all are either 5 or 1 star, depending on a viewer's sensitivity to profanity. Many of the profanity bashers claim the dialogue is unrealistic, while the show's fans rave about how great the dialogue is.Here's the truth: Both sides are right.Milch justifies the profanity by noting Deadwood was often cited as having foul-mouthed citizens. But they were foul by 1880s standards, not by the modern standards he employs. Furthermore, Milch combines the profanity with a kind of Shakespearean structure of speech.So are these Elizabethan criminals accurate/realistic? Nope, not in the slightest.But what's not to love about them? The dialogue is flat-out brilliant and ever-quotable. So, no, not realistic. But if you're a fan of language (and by 'language' I mean the way words can be used as tools and weapons, both subtle and blunt), you'll love this show."
2,Costumes & scenery great: language and profanity obscene,I know that miners were a tough breed but I can't believe that citizens of Deadwood used language like this. The story line is not enhanced by using nudity and profanity.
5,"A true ""HBO Original"" - Ignore the complaints","I notice several people complaining in reviews about the profane language used in Deadwood. Deadwood is one of the most compelling TV shows ever created. It is full of interesting characters, a mix of drama and humor, amazing costumes, and beautiful photography. It is luscious, intriguing and gritty. And yes, profane. The odd mixture of gutter and intellect appeals to me and many others who usually do not watch television.If you don't like the profanity, don't worry, they made a Western for you. It was Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."
5,Deadwood lives,"After watching the series on HBO, I couldn't wait to purchase the DVD set and watch the episodes over and over. The extra material on the final disk was very informative and entertaining as well. This is not a show for the faint hearted. Lots of blood, guts and language as well as nudity. Watch it after the kids have gone to bed. The story line has both actual historical characters and composite characters with much poetic license taken but is probably more a true portrayal of life in the west at that time than any of the so-called westerns we have seen in the movies or on TV before this."
2,Not What I Expected,"I absolutely LOVE Timothy Olyphant and Justified and thought I would try Deadwood. Not even close. It seem slow and I found it very hard to focus on. Soooo, I had to give it some stars simply because TO is in it."
2,Use of extensive modern profanity totally distracts from the story...,"I had heard that the producers said that the frontier people used profanity extensively but obviously profanity as spoken in the late 1800's. They said they updated and used modern words and phrases to get the feel of it. It seriously distracts from the story and you have to catch you self wondering if you are watching some sci-fi picture in which modern people are transported to the 1800's. Doesn't work well. I love how both versions of True Grit stayed true to the language of the original book. I think the show would have been much, much, better if they would have used period correct language. The challenge for the actors would have been to deliver it so that we knew it was profanity. I won't be buying the rest of the series, too bad, I had high hopes."
3,Too much swear words,"They story telling is good, but I think it could have been just as good without so much f bombs and vial filthy language....it's so unnecessary. It almost unpleasant to hear so much cursing."
5,True to history.,This is a great show. True to history. Well cast. Very entertaining. I looked forward to every episode. Watch it.
1,Jerry Springer Revisited,"I was unable to get through the first episode, being a big fan of the Soprano's, profanity used creatively and with a purpose does not bother me, however, using it to where it becomes a comedic distraction does.I really doubt, in the era they have sorely attempted to depict, did they repeatedly use the words ""mother f@#king c@nt"" and that is just the tip of the iceberg.I did not find this to be entertainment at all, best used as a door-stop."
2,True Life in Deadwood?,"It's hard to know exactly what life might have been in Deadwood over 100 years ago, but this series presents a very gritty, gutsy look at what it could have been. The ensemble of actors are unbelievably skilled and make each of their characters come alive. The dialogue, settings, photograghy and quality of writing is superb. We were hooked after the first episode and highly recommend owning the entire 3 seasons! We can only hope they will come back for either a 4th season or a full length movie at some point. 5 STARSNote: The language used in this series isn't for the faint of heart or appropriate for younger audiences however it does support the authenticity of life in this wild West mining town."
4,Husband loved it!!!,"I ordered this for my husband. He had seen previews on it on television but never had the time to watch the episodes. So I purchased Season 1 for him to view at his convenience. He loved it. He couldn't stop watching. He enjoyed the characters, they were real interesting, kept him curious as to what was going to happen next. He also enjoyed the wild west scenes and the animals in the movie."
4,great hbo tv show...,"1. rome - simply the best2. the sopranos - the first few seasons were awesome, but they've stumbled lately3. the wire - extremely good show4. da ali g show - featuring ali g and borat5. carnivale - the super slow pace of the 1st season did this show in, but the second season showed what promise it had for the future6. deadwood - feels inauthentic at first, but it grows on you. mcshane is awesome as swearengen. the filthiest show in terms of language ever.7. extras - not even in the same universe of greatness as the office uk, but hey it's still ricky gervais112030980989088098. sex and the city - truly the worst tv show ever made. incredibly poor. laughably ridiculous."
2,I just can't get into it.,"I was pretty excited to check this series out. It has a lot going for it, HBO, great setting, good actors. For some reason I just can't get into it. I don't need a lot of action, I don't mind the sometimes slow storylines, But I dont feel compelled to continue watching beyond this season. I care very little about the characters or their plots, the bad guys are too bad and the good guys are too flat."
4,Finally a good western!,"Deadwood is a classic western with modern appeal. There is great acting, the story line is interesting, and they throw in historic characters as well such as Wild Bill and Calamity Jane. Timothy Olyphant is delicious as the main character. I found the show funny, shocking, and enthralling. Overall, as a western genre fan, I rate this show at 4 stars. I would have given it 5 stars, but I found some of the violent scenes a bit excessive and stomach turning.Overall, a top notch western series."
2,Not up to Sopranos-level,"Having just rewatched the Sopranos and Mad Man, I was in the mood for a high-quality serial drama. And as a big fan of post-modern westerns like Cormac McCarthy's novels and There Will Be Blood, I figured Deadwood would fit the bill. Unfortunately, the show disappoints. All the dialogue is dense bloviation, peppered with profanity. The actors often don't even seem to understand the words they're reading and the profanity, apparently, isn't historically accurate. Timothy Olyphant is miscast as a gritty former sheriff prone to violence.Whatever its faults, you have to credit Deadwood for a few truly great performances, especially Ian McShane as an amoral saloonkeeper, pimp and opium peddler. His voice is as cracked and leathery as an old saddle. The preacher and doctor are also great, the latter being essentially the doctor character from Kurosawa's Drunken Angel."
3,Way too much swearing!,Don't get me wrong. I'm no saint but there is just too many swear words in the dialog. I find myself listening for the F words instead of paying attention to the story. I even counted the F words in one 30 minute stretch. (33) Sometimes there would be 2 F's in the same sentence. I don't think even the Irish swear that much!
5,As good as it gets...,"...for a TV series. After having seen many of the other HBO productions one can defenately spot out certain elements that recurr in their series, whether it be Sopranos, OZ, The Wire etc. Nevertheless even if one was to cut out the foul language, nudity and violence one would still end up with one hell of a TV show. One that no major network like NBC, ABC, WB or CBS would be able to pull off....or at least haven't to this day."
4,Great actor but wanted more,"the main reason to see this dvd is to see actor Ian Mcshane. He holds this whole series.Every time hes on the screen your transfixed. Im not familiar with his work,, but I want to be. If you like the bad guy in a movie. or your upset when the bad guy looses. This guy is for you. yeah the sets are cool, great filmed, but without Ian you have no series. I was kinda bored by the story not to much happened. Again only when Ian was on the screen did I rejoice. So if you wanna see the best bad guy that you love to hate rent this boxed set or borrow it."
4,We are hooked,"After watching two episodes of this series in Canada last fall (it was the only thing to watch) we wanted to see more. When Christmas rolled around I used it as a good excuse to get the complete first season. We are hooked. This is a perfect example of a show that catches you off guard due to its direct presentation. The characters are gritty and dark and all seem to have a past that is haunting them. It also portrays the old west as it probably was at that time in history. Dark, dirty...men doing whatever they had to do to survive let alone make their fortune. I appreciate that in a show. Don't sugar coat it, let me see it as it was. This one does that in a big way...the cast, the backdrop all work together to make this one of the best shows ever produced for TV. Too bad that the rest of the viewing world did not pick up on that. Their loss."
2,shallow,This was a big disappointment! So much profanity as to make it just stupid. Story line poor and a lack of action. Just couldn't hold my attention. Haven't a clue how it got so many good reviews. It lacked class. It was just bad taste.
5,THE BEST SHOW ON TV FOR 2004 AND 2005,GREAT SHOW BUT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH I MEAN COME ON....IT IS 12 EPS..EVEN OZ IS UNDER 50 BUCKS ...
1,Turned it off after 5 minuets.,"My wife and I turned this off after less than 5 minuets. There was hardly a sentence spoken without 1-3 unprintable words, and not just the usual stuff one might expect to hear in movies today. We just could not take the crude language. I was in the army for 3 years and didn't hear anyone that talked as crude as this, even drill sergeants. I would expect some foul language from most anything that Hollywood does today, but this is beyond any normal persons sensability. I don't know anything about the plot or acting and don't care. We never got that far. If the bad language stops you every few seconds, nothing else matters anyway. Do not buy this product!!! Do not waste your time to see it, even for free!! Do not let your friends see it!!! I have never done this before, but I'm going to send it back and see if they will give me my money back. Even if they don't give me my money back, I want them to know how bad it was and that we were absoulutly disgusted with it."
3,Deadwood is no Sopranos,"We'd heard a lot about Deadwood being just as good as the Sopranos. Well, it isn't. The constant foul language seems out of place, there doesn't seem to be a character to root for, and the story lines are weak and underdeveloped. Slightly more entertaining than summer reruns."
2,Too obscene to enjoy,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This show was so over the top with the profanity that I could not follow the storyline. I watched the first two episodes to give the show a chance, but nearly every scene contained very offensive language and a lot of it. I too am no prude (I think the Sopranos is the best show on TV). If you don't appreciate constantly hearing derogatory referrences to female anatomy parts, then this is not the show for you. I gave it 2 stars because it did create a unique mood of depression and confinement that made it stand out."
2,Profanity is way overdone - distracting,"I rented this one based on some of the reviews here (with a thought of buying it eventually) because the premise of the show is just so good. I wanted to like it; however, I have to concur with some of these reviews. The production is great, the acting is sometimes good, sometimes flat. But, the amount of profanity is just too much. I'm by no means a prude. I don't mind a bit of ""colorful"" language, but the amount used in this show is just plain distracting. It's a shame - great concept, poorly implemented."
2,Deadwood - almost a dog,"I agree with another reviewer who gave the show a 1 star. Perhaps the sets are realistic, who knows? There are no living survivors. Miners, and others of that age were probably even more filthy, and evil smelling than portrayed. I would doubt that so many folks used such overwhelming profanity, all the time, particularly the ""horrible"" ""f---"" word. No doubt they swore, and probably quite a bit, but every other word????? No way.On the other hand, it is an interesting portrayal of what really went on in the Black Hills during the gold rush days, probably quite close to actual events and conditionsI am not a prude, spent almost 20 years in the Navy, and heard lots and lots of profanity, even used some of it myself, but the constant use of vulgar words began to turn me off, and definitely turned my wife off. If not for that, I would have given the show at least a 4 or 4 and 1/2."
1,"Deadwood - The ""F"" Word","If you like the ""f"" word, you'll love Deadwood. Otherwise, it's just trash and a tremendous waste of money!"
3,Was ok except for sound quality,"FOr some reason reality entertainment really enjoys dubbing music over people being interviewed. You have to turn it up so loud in parts to even hear what is being said that it can be simply almost too annoying to bother. Content was excellent, sound made it much less enjoyable."
3,Good Introduction,"The book is actually a fairly good introduction to what neural networks are and how to use them.If you don't know anything about neural networks, it is an good way to learn about how to use them. Having said that, there are some bad points. I found a few errors in the description of how backpropagation works (page 141 says ""WA = -1.1 x .35 x .15, so WA = 0.21"", when WA should be -0.05775).As well the NetTalk project isn't finished yet, and I didn't see anything on the website that is supposed to have it. I suspect it never worked properly...The book does use the BASIC language, but the language isn't really that important.Don't expect this book to teach you how to make a good neural network in a programming language. You will need another book to cover them in more detail. However if you want an introduction to neural networks this book may well be a good choice"
5,A must for those interested in political philosophy,"If you want to explore an alternative way of looking at politics, philosophy, and trade this is a great book. It will help you grasp a side of socialism that most students of politics and philosophy never learn. Not light reading, but none the less, very interesting."
3,Motorola battery,"Don't know if the battery I purchased was new or possibly, in some way, refurbished, but it does not hold the charge as well as the battery I was attempting to replace. Probably should have gone to the manufacturer of the phone, even though it contains same identifying information as the old battery. Service good, but battery questionable."
3,"Quickly lost its ""recharge-ability""","After using it a couple of times, it didn't maintain a charge. I did buy it from an Amazon user and not from a bigger seller. Though I bought it new, I had a bad experience with this item and would not recommend the purchase of this item."
1,did not use the product,"Actually I never used the battery because it did not fit on my cell phone. I wrote to you as well as to the consumer who i purchased the item from but I never got a response as to where I could send it back or how I could get my money back. I hope I can get some help from you. The product was a Motorola slim cell phone battery SNN5588 T720 to T730. Who can I direct my request for a refund? Please advise.thank you,M. Ibarrasecond request)"
4,Nice!,"Nice aggressive look on a 1994 Chevrolet Blazer 2-door!Not so easy to mount, need patience and a little professionality."
3,2010???,this is being released in 2010???? um... wow. way to give us 5 and a half years to wait... i bet this is a non-existant dvd. however i know good charlotte is coming out with a live in england dvd soon and an album october 5th.
2,The Sizing is off,I found the post old school Forums and I had to have them. I usually wear a size 11.5 us and that's what I ordered. They arrived on time and in new condition. I tried them on they were a size too small and they pinched my toes something terrible. I sent them back and bought some larger ones at a store close to home. The seller was nice enough to credit my account as soon they received them/
2,Not the best,The pen writes really lightly and tends to clump ink from time to time. It's also not the smoothest pen. I use these to grade papers and the ink doesn't stand out all that much.
5,Quality,"I also teach and use these to correct student work. I can't believe how long each one lasts. They do not seem to dry out or leak without the cap and the writing quality is superior to the Papermate, which I find does not do as smooth job of continuous ink release.This is a great pen."
1,Back To The Drawing Board Bic.,"**Brief Review**I am usually a fan of Bic products. But not this one. This pen does not write smooth at all. It seems that if a lot of time between usuage goes by, you'd better have a scrap piece of paper handy. You'll need it to scratch on and jump start this pen.Also just about every time I pull the over-tight cap off, I end up disassembling the pen. I see the other reviewer before me had the same gripe(s).Don't waste your money, you'd be better off stealing pens from the bank..."
2,Great curler; but forget finding refills!!!!,"If you like buying brand new eye lash curlers every few months, then you won't mind this La Cross brand. It's one of the best I've used. However, good luck trying to find refills. No wonder they give you a free ""refill"" with it....after the pad is worn out, you'll never find another good replacement pad. The generic pads flop around inside (since the LaCross curler pad tends to be longer than the generic and fits tighter). I even emailed LaCross but they say they don't carry them. (How much could it cost to put 3 in a pack and sell it??) Seems petty, but wouldn't you be mad if you bought an electric toothbrush, a water filter system, or a razor and couldn't find refills later?"
2,Buy it for refills,"This eyelash curler doesn't fit my eyes, the only reason I buy it is for the 4 refills I can then use in my 16 year old Revlon curler - the only one that actually fits my eyes, maybe 16 years ago people had different eye shapes?!? So to sum it up: GOOD REFILLS, THROW AWAY CURLER. I know, what a waste!"
5,"Great size, Sturdy","I bought 3 of these boxes to store socks and unmentionables because they fit perfectly in the cheap, modular shelving units I used to use in my closet as a makeshift tiny dresser. They are sturdy little boxes, and REALLY added some style to my low budget closet organizer! Now that I've upgraded to a real dresser and gotten rid of the cheap shelving units, I still use these boxes for multimedia, miscellaneous extra computer cords, and my wii games/accessories. They are good looking, and good quality. The colors are nice and natural feeling, the leather is a nice, stylish touch."
5,Great cleaner,Works great on guitar necks (unfinished wood). Gets off all the stuff you want gone and does not harm your finish. Has a very pleasant smell as a bonus. A little of this on the corner of a microfiber cloth goes a long way. Best product I've found for cleaning guitars.
4,Product as described,"Received the product in good time and product was as described and expected. Have not, however, used it so can't rate the quality of it."
1,Not what you want!,"The product is priced cheap and is small.But you get what you pay for...I had no problem with no flash, bad indoor pictures, losing pictures if you do not change the battery etc.I bought it for my daughter.But the camera often will not download the pictures.I contacted tech support and they told me to delete all the pictures, take out the battery and wait awhile.This does not help since you lose ALL your pictures everytime this happens.Why have a camera if you cannot get the pictures?This little issue alone makes the camera useless."
2,What Happened to my Duracell Ultra Battery?,"Never mind the fact that picture quality is below average for the resolution this camera provide. This camera literally drains battery. The battery came with the package completely died after taking just three pictures and transferring those pictures to my PC. New Duracell Ultra battery completely drained after two weeks in the camera w/o any usage. I gave this camera a two star just because the unique size. Word of advice, you get what you pay for. Don't waste your precious money on this camera."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The pictures are terrible. The camera often refuses to take pictures indoors even in well lit areas. The battery dies quickly, erasing all your pictures with no warning.On the plus side, it mades a superb webcam, and it much cheaper than most webcams, so for the price, it was worth buying.But if you are looking at this for the camera function, don't buy. :-)"
4,luuuv it,"It's cute, it's tiny and pretty well finished for this small price. the size alone makes it worthwhile even if you already own a digital camera. It goes with me whereever I go and the quality is enough for web and email pictures. Of course it works best in bright light outdoors, but it's not bad indoors. Hey for this price you won't even get a replacement battery for one of the $... digital cams..."
1,will not work with newer computers!,"SiPix has a problem- their cameras only work with older computers! If you have a newer model with a usb 2 port it won't work- and there seems to be no fix available. Judging by the information on their web site, even the newly released models (e.g., the ""snap) only work on the older standard- so if you have a new computer, or an older one with usb2- save yourself the headache and buy from a different manufacturer."
3,"Pretty cool, but Macintosh users beware","Can't beat the price and the package is mighty tiny. Warnings about the image quality are correct, but for [$$] I think the image quality is just fine. What zapped me, however, is the lack of Macintosh support. The device is USB and TWAIN, so it can't be very hard to support the Mac. It works on my PC but not on my Mac. There goes my plan to give one to my kid to use on his Mac."
1,Completely useless,"The camera cannot be used as the Twain drivers are not compatible with any computers I have found. I have attempted to contact the company with no response, except for a ""Thanks for writing"" message.What I meant to be a fun gift for a friend has turned into an irritating and embarrassing waste, due to the company's lack of assistance.My advice? Don't buy this item"
2,Bleeh,"I had this camera although is adorable and it felt as if i was a james bond movie person, it took horrible pictures. The inside pictures if it didn't have the right amount of light the camera would not take pictures at all and when I took pictures outdoors it woould have a blue outline around the images.The saying you get what you pay for is very true."
2,Wrong lens,"The lens that SiPix chose for this camera is too small for the imager used. Note that most of the examples shown are either in round or oval frames. This hides that fact that the edges are blurred. And it doesn't matter how steady you hold the camera.Following is SiPix technical support's response to a question concerning this blurring:""The camera uses a wide angle lens, this causes the outer edges to be slightly blurred.Thank you for contacting SiPix Technical Support.""I think that response speaks volumes ...This is NOT a camera company with an view like that about the images their product produces."
5,Just for fun,"If you are looking for high-end quality pictures, you're looking at the wrong place. But if you're looking for a regular quality shots and don't want to spend a lot of money the StyleCam is the right one. How can you ask for a great quality pictures for less than.. Even a film camera taking good pictures can cost you about..to...The software is very easy to use (but don't have a manual), the camera is even easier to use, and it works great as a web cam. Be sure to hold the camera very steady because it has a slight shutter lag of about half a second. This can be annoying, but after a while you will remember this automatically."
2,What utter garbage.,"I bought this camera as a gift for my 14-year-old sister, with the reasoning that she'd enjoy taking pictures of her friends with it; it's cute, it's small, and it would eliminate the process of buying disposables time after time. Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to the reviews of it here on Amazon, because they're right. The picture quality is horrible. Discolored and blurry pictures are the only results gotten out of this thing. Do not--do NOT waste your money on this camera. It's not geared towards younger people as a first-digital-camera, it's just garbage."
2,You get what you pay for,"This camera takes fair pictures in perfect conditions. As long as you have good light, the subject is not moving and you have hands of steel, you can get a good picture. It will not take in medium light conditions. If you tap the button while taking a picture it will blur. And if you taking picture of something moving at walking speed, it will be unrecognizable. Works well enough as a web cam. As long as whayever you set it on doesn't move."
2,Substandard at any price,"People who rave about this thing either work for the company or are vision impaired. I bought one on a whim so I could take it with me on vacation. I can honestly say that of the 100s of pictures I took with it, not one was a keeper. The shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless, your pictures are blurred. I found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures. The camera ""crashed"" often, and I needed to take out the battery to ""reboot"" it. This happened a lot. The camera worked in sunlight, but pics taken indoors were way too dark. This thing is not ready for prime time. not even at these prices."
4,Outstanding Performance,I like this product because I can send pictures online to my family and friends also you can use this product for making family videos its unlimited video if connected to your computer that whats makes it fun! PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT! THANK YOU!
2,Seen better,"This camera has not satissfied me, even as a toy. It works only under sunlight, else it blurs the image, and it requires too much time to take a pic under room light. Also, the sides of the pictures look round. It's still very small, but there are others in the market better, with the same price."
1,Don't touch SiPix with a bargepole- support is rubbish,"I have just bought a SiPix WebCam 3 for my son's birthday. The driver software did not install (on Windows 98SE). I asked SiPix for technical support. All I got were questions asking me if I had tested the driver contained in the EMPTY folders it had set up? On the advice of Amazon.com, I tried to download the driver from the SiPix site. After 45 minutes of download, all I got was a manual advising me to load the software from the (non-working) CD-ROM supplied with the camera.Is the camera itself any good? I can' find out!"
1,Won't Work With USB 2.0,"Was so excited to get this tiny little ""spy"" camera, however (a BIG however), you cannot download pictures if you have a newer computer with USB 2.0. Check this out before buying."
1,Compatibility problem,"I bought this and was thrilled with the size, the ease of installing the software, and the uses of such a tiny camera.Then, I discovered after taking photos at a big charity party -that my camera was not compatible with Windows XP.All of our computers use the XP platform!"
1,Oh so disappointed,"I was skeptical about this camera, but it got enough good reviews that I thought it might be a fun thing to have. I wasn't expecting to use it to take artistic shots to keep and treasure forever and ever, but I did think I'd get something other than shapeless blurs. Unfortuntately, I think this camera will get little to no use, because it just isn't worth the trouble of checking to see if the battery is dead (usually yes), taking the pictures, and uploading them onto the computer (if they haven't inexplicably disappeared) using the awkward, poorly designed software (with no documentation whatsoever). I have gotten a total of zero useful photos with this item. If you want a digital camera, don't buy this one: you still won't really have anything more than you started with."
5,someone needs to open their eyes!,"This book sheds much needed light on the poor state of journalism that our country is dealing with. Mark Nuckol's review just helped re-enforce the fact that most Americans are blind about the political decisions that are be made by our government and multinational corporations. Like most people, his views are either black or white with an occassional dab of gray as to not be labeled a static thinker. It is everyone who should educate themselves on the real issues at hand in our society and give your brains the enemas they so badly need."
1,FREE MUMIA!,"Mumia may or may not have shot that cop in Philly - I could really care less. But if there was a death penalty for bad writing, he'd sure be a candidate for the chair....If these ""Censored"" people would just look around, they'd quit whining so much. There are plenty of sources of info and opinion - they seem to be more miffed that they're not on Nightline, with their silly pet theories about lead mines in Kosovo being NATO's cassus belli. I suggest to the editors two little baby steps: 1) read Waugh's novel Scoop - you'll understand ""journalism"" much better than you do now and 2) subscribe to The Economist. Then drop me line and we'll move to baby steps 3 and 4 on how to become a thinking, educated consumer of information."
5,A masterpiece wonderfully written,"The late Mr Pope has written a classic on not only the famous battle at Trafalgar but also the day to day lives of officers and men in the Age of Sail. Some powerful accounts of what it was like for the British Royal Navy taking on a larger French and Spanish fleet in 1805. Filled with colorful characters, blazing battles at sea, storms, the harsh treatment of the sailors and the unbelievable courage under fire as shot and canister tear into the open decks. One of the finest accounts of one of the most important sea battles in history and Mr Pope explains why this slug fest is considered so. Not to be missed by anyone interested in the lusty days of iron men and wooden ships.Five t'gallants for this masterpiece."
1,Program is more complicated then learning HTML,"By the time you figure this program out you could have learned HML. I`m other word it not a very good easy to understand format where you can just start using it right away. I gave up wasting my time on it. . I have seen a few hosting services that have easy to understand templates that are very well formatted and easy to manipulate, but you really got to look around unfortunately. Maybe I'll just serch simple html code ""basic easy html..."
1,Sucky Program,"I think that this ""web easy 5"" software sucks, the link thing did not work either, it kept opening it up in new windows! It really sucks, I am getting web editor 6.0!"
3,Good for a beginner,"When I first started writing, I wanted to create a website. Now many people said I should go with a professional but I just wanted to do it myself. After comparing price and what it could do(at the time I didn't know what I wanted) I bought it.Now keep in mind that I had absolutely no experience in working with webpages and no programming background at all except a small amount of basic on my old commodore 64.I had pages up and running in a few hours. But there were a few things that annoyed me.First of all, every page had to be the same size. Don't know if that's the way it is with all programs, but it's just annoying.Secondly, I wanted to add programs for download but am unable to.Also, everytime I changed the graphics even small, then the page is all screwed up on Aol. Don't know why, but after awhile it straightens itself out. Received limited help from Aol about it.All in all, I do like it but if you want more versatility, look for another one."
1,Don't waste your money,"These people should not be allowed to advertise their product using the word ""easy"". Yes, their web site design is fairly easy once you catch on to it, but don't expect the manual to be of much help. It assumes you are an expert to begin with and doesn't define terms very well, so plan on doing a lot of guessing and experimenting. The really hard part is getting your site published. After several unsuccessful tries (WebEasy congratulates me and says my site has been published successfully, but when I go to look at it, it says the site has not been uploaded properly) and after an e-mail from their ""help desk"" that started out by saying ""What you should try is..."", I gave up. I needed help from them. I can try things myself. I don't need their experts guessing at what might work.I finally decided the frustration wasn't worth it and got another program. In good conscience, I could never recommend WebEasy to anyone."

1,Disappointing.,"I love Sinbad but this wasn't even funny! I could not believe he actually made and released this video. I watched it all the way thru even though I was ready to dump it 15 minutes in. It never got any better, very disappointing!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this one because of a previous one I had gotten and it was not as funny or fun as that one, so I was disappointed in it.I guess I didn't care that much about ""the Funk"" but for those who do, have at it, this ones for you."
3,Enjoy Sindbad,I love watching Sindbad. I loved his DVD titled Where U Been? However this one Nothin' But The Funk didn't do it for me. It wasn't as funny as his other ones. Then again that's just my opinion.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Bought this DVD based upon his work ""Where U Been"" which made me laugh out loud and often. Unfortunately, this performance was not very funny and quite dissapointing."
5,Sinbad where you been,I am trying to find Sinbad's take on how dancing has changed through the years. I saw the comedy special once and laughed so hard I was crying. Plese help.
2,Sibad: Nothin'But the Funk,"The movie was ok, but it was not what I was looking for. Not a large selection."
4,Sinbad's material holds up,"I recently had a memory pop into my head of Sinbad speaking to a bunch of people out in the open. I couldn't remember where it was shot, but luckily enough, the description here on Amazon listed the location, so I had to get the DVD.This is a fun stand-up, and Sinbad talks about relationships, black culture (don't worry, you'll still get it even if you're white), family, and various other realms. The comedy holds up well after all these years, but some younger kids may not fully get where Sinbad's coming from. Regardless, everyone will get a kick out of this show. You'll find it rather enjoyable, and for the cheap price, if you're thinking about getting it, you might as well go for it. You will laugh!"
1,Awful,"I ordered this item on Dec. 23, 2001. Right now, it is January 25, 2010 and I didn't receive this book yet.I wrote several email to the seller. However, the seller didn't respond to my email.That's really awful experience at Amazon.com"
3,Textbook,The text book arrived in a very timely manner. There is more writing and highlighting in the book than I had hoped for.
4,lovely vest,I would recommend for wedding and graduation. The quality is good and the color was just the shade i was looking for
2,Very small for size XL. I sent back.,"Ordered XL, very small XL. would not even button. Sent back. Tie was nice. If your not on the thin size forget it."
5,Great price,"This book arrived 2 weeks before my class started, new condition, at a lower price than the college bookstore."
4,"Short season, but fun!","Season 1 is short, but a good introduction to a series that will have you laughing until you hurt. Leslie Knope may seem a bit extreme at first, but she quickly grows on you, as do the rest of the cast."
5,wish i had seen earlier,"started watching this show about a week ago and became obsessed. a lot of people compare this to the office which is right in a way. the filming is similar in terms of a mocumentary, but the writing and humor beat it by ten fold. the characters are unique and hilarious in their own way. no doubt that once you get into it you will be hooked."
3,Worst of the season,"I recently started watching Parks and Recreation on my Roku with Prime. What a great way to get caught up on shows!After completing Season one, I was disappointed in the last episode. I hope it is not an indication of things to come in later seasons as the laughs just weren't there like the first five episodes."
5,Don't give up!,"The first season starts out slowly as you have to give it time to get used to the characters. I didn't think I would like it. Nevertheless, around 8-10 episodes in, I started to realize what they were doing with the different characters' personalities and what not. I quickly finished all 4 seasons and now realize this show is hilarious!"
1,Argh! IDK if it's me or what ...,"well, IDK if it's me or what but i just found this show really boring. I can see that it's reaching for a ""dry-humor"" type of style but it pretty well misses the mark. Oh, it does hit the ""dry"" but doesn't ever get to the ""humor"". I think it's maybe trying to be like that show Samantha Who? in that the main female character is flighty but really upbeat while her co-workers / friends are jaded. Unfortunately, the woman in this show comes across with some racist insinuations and does it in a way as to appear ignorant of her blunder. It just makes it more offensive. I won't be watching it again. Of course, this is just my personal opinion and some folks might find this show really entertaining so go on and watch this free one and judge for yourselves.^^"
2,ehh...,"I found this to be mildly amusing, but rather chintzy overall. There are a lot of stock characters - the ditzy but impassioned blond, the poor woman, the male interest, a few ethnic side characters. It's worth a look, to get a sense of the show, but this doesn't make me want to watch any more of teh season -- and it's a pilot!"
1,Ugh,Really boring. Trying to be The Office but just nothing happening. Good cast but they have literally nothing to work with.
2,Couldn't get past the pilot,I finished arrested development and was looking for a similar comedy so I gave parks and rec a look. It is awful. I've heard good things about it and I am at a loss. It isn't funny.
1,Not worth the effort,"Like many people, I can have my interest spiked by advertising and such was the case with this show. The advertising generated sufficient interest to get me to watch the ""pilot"" program, however, having done that, I will not be watching any of the other episodes (despite one review which indicates that the second season ""gets better"").In my opinion, the ""pilot"" should set the scene for what is to come. It should generate sufficient interest to induce you to watch another episode and another and so on. As it did not do this for me there is no logic in watching further episodes."
1,Unbearable Television Show,"I could not bear the acting and there is a lack of a plot. I have never viewed anything so bad. I normally give my viewed DVD's to veteran's at the VA, but I love vet's to much to give them something this horrible."
3,It looks like they're trying,"You can tell that, on paper at least, all the jokes should be funny. It also makes sense to center the pilot around Amy Poehler since she's proven she can be really funny. Her supporting cast looks like promising comedy talent as well.Somehow, something was just missing. Looking back at early episodes of ""The Office"", that show also took a while to really get some legs on it. Hopefully this show lasts long enough where everyone gets the chemistry going and it gets really funny. Poehler came across as trying too hard, maybe if they start giving screen time to her supporting cast so it's a bit more even like ""The Office"" is now it'd help."
5,Great show,"It's The Office, but for smart people. If you like political humor and dry satire, the first season will get you hooked. Lots of great characters in this show, recurring and cameos."
4,Enjoyable satire,Amy Poehler shines in this series about the small town ups and downs in the department of Parks and Gardens.Quirky characters add to the fun in the series.Will watch more seasons. Relaxing and fun!
3,If you can't get enough of the office watch this.,"Watchable. Identical show as the office including many of the characters. Had heard good things. Meh, I have already seen the office."
2,meh,"I only watched the pilot, did not find it entertainingNothing more to say about the item but you have to have so many words in review:("
4,Funny,"Takes a few episodes for them to find their comfort zone, but when it does, it's pretty hilarious. meow meow"
2,Not Funny,"Wasn't as funny as people suggested.Wasn't the goofy kind of show we like.Each show didn't have a theme, which often helps the humor and situations."
5,fantastic,"I love Parks and Recration. As I've heard other people say, it gets better as you go. However, I started watching halfway through the second season, and this DVD makes the second season make more sense, and more funny. If you don't get into it after an episode, just try to stick with it. Leslie, Ann, Tom, Mark, April, and Andy are awesome."
4,Pass It Around,"I'd never heard of ""Mice Pardade"" until recently, and I've been missing out. This is the first album of theirs I grabbed and it's a gem."
1,Deceptive!,"This very clever series of books portrays the universe (over and over again) as a thoughtful, deliberate creative force.How is this any different than creationism / intelligent design?If you don't want your child's earliest impressions of the universe to be slanted toward one in which there must be some kind of a Designer involved, these books are NOT a good choice.Also, many of the illustrations are not even very reflective of what is being described."
1,Disappointing mix of fact and fiction,"This book is just plain odd. The story of the big bang is told in the first person, from the perspective of the universe. It mixes the universe's ""thought process"" with some real science and produces a result that often seems more like fiction than science. The universe describes its' dreams; wonders if it could ever ""feel feelings like love, sadness, and wonder;"" and states that it is proud of creating hydrogen atoms. The scientific part of the book is intermingled with such sappy drivel that it is hard to separate fact from fiction. It is true that many of the pictures are beautiful but they have no real scientific merit.I bought this book for my eight year old daughters to supplement the science curriculum at their school. I wouldn't waste their timing reading it with them. I am returning this book."
3,"""Fruity"" mixed with good science","I didn't realize what people meant by refering to this book as ""New Age"" - basically the ""Universe"" is narrating the story and ""dreams"" of people and trees and planets. The timeline and discription of big bang and star life cycles is great - but I am uncomfortable with the ""wishes"" and ""dreams"" and ""feelings"" of a universe.I was looking for an age appropriate book to explain the formation of the universe to my 5 year old - and it has captured his imagination. As an atheist trying to build a good basis of science over superstition, I felt that the narration was over the top, when the science is way cool and didn't need the whole dream/wish/creator overtones."
5,Incredibly interesting to both reader and child,It takes a great deal of skill to reduce as complex a concept as the creation of the universe to a form a five year old child can understand. My grandson was captivated and asked many questions and I learned a few things also. We promptly read the second book in the series and have ordered the third.
4,"Born with a Bang, The Universe Tells Our Cosmic Story","I was entertained by this imaginative, yet scientific ""telling"" of many transformations that the Universe has gone through from the Big Bang up to the formation of our solar system. The book assumes consciousness precedes material manifestation. I have seen children listen wide-eyed and pleased to have this story told from the point of view of the ""first person"". It makes what could be dry cosmological science seem very personal. I especially appreciated the scientific markers in the back of the book which revealed a number of new conclusions that were unknown when I went to school. The illustrations are amazing and evocative."
4,"Complex, but interesting and lovely to look at","My children like this book a lot. I find it a bit strange that the universe is anthropomorphized and given a ""purpose"", but this seemed fine for my kids, who enjoy having a narrative to follow. There are many very complex scientific terms in the book - more than I understand, frankly - but I appreciate that my kids are being exposed to the hard science of how the universe formed."
1,Science as a fairytale?,"I got the 3 books in this series to aid in my effort to counter the young-earth creationism my kids are sure to be fed in their church. I am trying to instill in them early on that science is not a belief system, but is based on what we can observe and test. These books make the science of how the world formed sound like a fairytale, which I am afraid will confuse them as that is the opposite of what I am trying to teach. I am going to return these books without reading to them and I will keep looking for something more straightforward."
1,Poorly conceived concepts for a young audience,"I was hoping this would be a good introductory text for my 5 years daughter, however I found the narrative too wordy and disturbing. The author tries to covey the concept of powerful forces in the universe with phrases like ""that would crush your bones"" or ""melt your muscles"". I think they could have chosen better concepts to convey these ideas to a child. I returned this book promptly. My daughter did not seem interested in it other than the pretty graphics."
1,This is the universe on drugs.,"In brief: an anthropomorphized universe (that has smoked way too much weed) tells its story.Within 5 minutes of opening my Amazon box, I was back online to return it. I don't know if it's telling that they told me I didn't have to return the book in order to receive a refund.I am trying to put together an evolution/pre-history unit for my daughter (yes, I'm a homeschooler), but I cannot stomach the ""voice"" of this book. Give me facts, or even an interesting story, but please don't give me some kookie, drug-induced vision complete with swirly pictures."
1,Not good for K-2. Pictures awful- blobs of color and swirls.,"Anti-particle, hydrogen globs, planetary pups.....I felt myself doing all the explaining, when I was hoping the book would do that for me. The pictures are just swirls of colors- never shows a final product ""A picture of an Earth"". Almost like something make-believe in my sons eyes. Jennifer Morgans ""Lava to Larva"" 2nd book summarizes this book in just a few pages. Dont care care for it much either- same goofy pictures, doesnt show evolution of man."
5,Problems with kindle edition,"Serious problems with kindle edition. Wrong title, skips from table of contents to middle of book. Had to return, which is a shame because I am eager to read this book. But I'll give the content 5 stars without even reading it because I think the topic is so important!"
4,Besser is great,"This show is a fine sitcom. Bishop was a nice middle of the road comic, and Abby Dalton is beautiful and funny. Yet Besser steals the show with his antics. He is less frentic then usual playing up the cute as opposed to the bratty sides of his well honed character. For his charismatic performances alone this set should be treasured."
3,NO OPENING CREDITS,"At first I was fooled by the nice packaging, then I watched it and saw there was opening credits for any of the episodes - and the color on the episodes are very poor. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!"
5,Orgasmic sound...but,"Easily the best sounding headphones I""ve ever had, but be prepared for everyone around you to hear what you are listening too, since the head phones moved air to produce the rich natural sound it leaks alot of it out, I found this an advantage as the headphones where Crystal clear at low volumes enabling me to hear conversations around my desk as I worked, came in quite handy. The pads that come with it only go around the ear leaving your ears pressed up against uncomfortable material, I sugest getting the full coving Grados Headphone Pads, sounds good with out a pre amp, even better with make sure you get the adaptor if your just going to be playing it off quarter inch outputs."
5,definitely worth the purchase,"I've listened to several high-quality headphones, including the Hifiman He-400s and AKG701s, both of which are excellent. But the Grados have the advantage of sounding great driven by an IPAD/IPHONE/IPOD, while the former need amplification. For the price you really can't do better. Fine quality, U.S. made product. The only downside is that they become fatiguing after 2 hours. But then, it's a good thing to take a break once in awhile. Just get 'em."
1,Regrettable purchase.,"Purchased the SR325I here and was impressed with the sound. Then they stopped working after about 2hrs use. Returned them for repairs. Repairs lasted only about an hour then left can stopped working. Returned and asked for them to replace with new set. These lasted 15 minutes before they again quit working. Returned these to Grado and asked for a full refund and as of yet have not heard from them or received my money. Nor have they responded to the complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau.The headphones sounded good when they did work, the problem is probably an assembly issue and most defintely an issue of attitude with these people. BEWARE buying these! If you have problems with them you may be out $300 like I am."
3,Sweet pain,"Expensive, beautifully made, wonderful sounding headphones that feel like you've clamped each ear tightly with a pair of vice-grip pliers. I want so much to love these headphones...but Grado seems to have a design philosophy that states ""one must be cruel to be kind.""I gave these 3 stars because, at almost $300, there are cheaper ways to induldge in pain."
5,Great story!,This book tells how war makes people do what they weren't normally able to do. It shows the human side of a soldier. It happened during a time when things were a little simpler than they are today.
5,Incredible Resource for Everyone,"Even as a retired law enforcement officer, I was surprised about how much I learned reading this book. It provides clear, but often little-known secrets on how to avoid everyday consumer traps, and provides a good look into the inner workings of various scams. The topics covered are expansive, and include nearly every purcahse and then some. From buying or repairing cars to getting a mortgage to avoiding diseases and protecting your job, this book covers it all. It is clear and cleverly written and research is fantastic. Really an excellent book!"
5,Do yourself a favor and read this,An excellent book for protecting yourself from most common schemes to defraud you of your hard earned money. I found it up to date with practical advice about strategies to protect yourself.
3,simple but entertaining,This book is good for 2 to 3 year olds. The illustrations resemble real life. The children in my class enjoyed it.
3,"Great software, good hardware.","This is a wonderful system -- the scans are clean, the Adobe Acrobat is almost worth the price of admission by itself, the scanning is lightening fast. After weeks of working with the scanner and the bundled Adobe Acrobat, I have pitched 11 full drawers of old records and taken up less than 10 gig of space on my Mac. I am well on the way to working virtually, from here, there, or anywhere. The occasional paper jams are annoying, but the office mammoth network scanner/copier jams, too.It's small, it sits right at the edge of my desk, and just whips through the new correspondence and prevents the files from growing, as I whittle them down. Oh, and it would be nice if it came packaged with a carrier sleeve for those odd size pages [they're not easy to find], but all in all it's a great machine."
3,Could be Better...,"I spend a lot of time scanning my documents to save space in my highly papered environment. I have been using an HPG85 All-In-One Printer for the most part of the last two years and have often been frustrated by the inconsistancy of its network support in scanning. I purchased this scanner in hopes that it's USB connection will alliviate my multi-page scanning issues and find that it works ok for the most part. I find that during multi-page scanning it still jams almost as often as my All-In-One. For a dedicated hardware device whose only job is scanning, I find this disconcerting.It is easy to use however, and I find the duplex scanning ability a serious time saver.Fujitsu needs to spend more effort on making its multi-page feed mechanism's more jam proof."
5,Excellent product,Does exactly what it says. Very simple installation and operation. Software is very fast (on my G5/Dual 2.5).
5,Review ofFujitsu SCANSNAP FI-5110EOXM-15PPM FOR MAC USB 2.0 ( PA03360-B035 ),This device works very well to scan papers and meets all my expectations.
5,Extraordinary,What a wonderful machine. Scanning is effortless. It hardly ever jams and takes up minimal space on my desk. I cannot recommend this scanner enough
4,I never got over those blue eyes.,"This was Johnny Cash's first album for Columbia Records. Two singles were released from the album, ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town"" (#1 Country, #32 Pop) and ""Frankie's Man, Johnny"" (#9 Country, #57 Pop). The album also features the classic ""I Still Miss Someone"" (which was the b-side of ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town"", incidentally). Most of the other songs on the album are very good, particularly ""One More Ride"", ""That's Enough"" and ""Pickin' Time"". The CD adds six bonus tracks, five of which are previously unreleased in the U.S. These songs are generally not as good as the ones that were on the original album, although they are not bad by any means. ""Walking the Blues"" is a great country-blues, and the alternate take of ""Oh What a Dream"" is a real treat, being the first take of the first song Johnny ever recorded for Columbia. Recommended to fans of Johnny Cash."
3,For Cash Historians Only,"This album consists of remastered tracks from early Columbia work by Johnny Cash. For Cash fans over 60, there may be some nostalgia here. For those of us who like background, it gives a picture of where the man came from musically. For those who are fans from the 1960's on, it will probably be a disappointment. His voice lacks the character it took on in later years (bet you thought he always sounded like that) and the songs and arrangements lack the vision and quality we are used to. The only memorable cuts are ""I Still Miss Someone"" and ""Don't Take Your Guns To Town."" This is a lot like reading Hemingway's high school compositions. The promise is discernable, but far from what we have come to expect from a genius at his craft."
4,Straight Talk to Men and Their Wives,"The title says this book contain ""straight talk,"" and it does. Dobson is right on the money in his description of our relationships in our marriage and our family of origin. This book helped to save my marriage. There are many aspects of this book that I believe are timeless. In every age we each must struggle to discover a path of selflessness rather than selfishness in order to develop the positive relationships we crave."
3,looks up to date....it's not.,It may be classic renditions but I have the vinyl.Thought it was modern recordings with name artist.It's all mono.
4,Good Book,"Shared story time w/my daughter and grand daughter. Really appreciate the vivid images, and detailed EASY TO READ text. Great collectors item. A must have for everyone's library."
4,A nice continuation for the series.,Really enjoyed this latest addition to the series. I enjoyed reading Inherit the Stars back in 1978 and now in this story Hogan helped to fill in some of the questions arising from Entoverse while at the same time showing more about the lives of the Ganymeans and what happened to them after 25 million years. Nicely done.
4,It is worth every penny,"My first paintball marker! The gun works amazingly well. I've used it numerous times under various conditions, given it a workout, subjected it to some rough treatment and it continues to work fine. It never jams, is very accurate, lightweight and dependable. It easily disassembles for cleaning and performs! The mask is tolerable, the accessories are good and reliable. This particular unit was sold as new, but it was obviously refurbished. The package was opened and resealed, the hopper had scratches on it and the tank leaked. The product is great, the vendor questionable."
3,"Good, but not Frat-tastic","The Fraternity is a story of two rival vampire fraternities at a small Southern college in the early 30's. If only it were set in the present day, with shaggy-haired, be-North Faced frat vampires who do keg stands and get bj's. Now that's a book I would enjoy. As it is, though, Gresham does well with characterization and creating tension. His prose is not of the highest level, but it's not bad for a book you get for four dollars at Wal-Mart."
4,Core Ball,"Has wonderful workouts, would recommend this to others. Great for beginners still trying to learn how to balance on the ball."
5,"Good toning, not a lot of sweating","I like this workout and I pick it on the days that I'm not in the mood to sweat. I like how it really stretches you out. I feel loose and relaxed afterward. I have noticed that my core is strengthen up a bit from doing this for a couple months. It is not my only work-out.It is a pleasant video. I think the more segments you add, the more you'll get out of it.My mother uses this one too, she cannot take the stress of a high-impact workout. It is easy on the the joins and limbs. You do need to learn to balance, so don't rush yourslef.If you're a cardio nut - this is not for you.I will definately keep this one and keep using it. Worth the money and the time."
2,Too remedial,This work out is for anyone who has never seen a balance ball. There is a painstakingly long slow discussion at the begining discussing the basics of balance ball work out. There might be 20 minutes of advanced exercises at the end of the DVD but the rest was a total waste of time.
3,Not my favorite,"I'm a beginner and am fairly out of shape, so I thought this would be a good start for me. Unfortunately, it moves WAY too slow and is quite boring, even for a beginner. I find myself fast forwarding through the first several minutes of each section as the lady explains (talking VERY slowly) how to position yourself on the ball and find your balance.The DVD does contain excerpts from a pilates workout, which are meant for more ""advanced"" users, but those routines really aren't that hard and are much more enjoyable. I wish I'd gotten a DVD full of those routines instead of this one."
3,Not enough challenge,"This tape is for the absolute beginner. It is slow and painstakingly repetitive, and not terribly challenging. The best part about it are the supplemental exercises from Pilates Complete Sculpt and Tone, a DVD I am planning to purchase soon."
1,Did not like this at all,"Please do not waste your money on this. It is terrible, slow, and boring. I am extremely disappointed."
4,Pleased,"As a serious, but beginning Spanish student, I have been pleased with this dictionary. It has been helpful, useful, and interesting. But I have sometimes wondered if I should have purchased the larger version."
3,syllables,It seems to me that quite a number of people that speak Spanish pretty well still have a horrible accent because in Spanish they break the syllables down differently. For example in English we want to say Rod-ri-go and in Spanish one says Ro-dri-go. So I am looking for a dictionary that offers a little help with pronunciation of the Spanish. Granted it is easier to pronounce Spanish then English but on the same hand it wouldn't require a great deal of effort to give us a little more info. For example the word adherirse (to adhere) is listed as a-dhe-RIR-se instead. Anyone know of such a dictionary?
2,"Nope, Pointless","I thought this would be a movie for my son to watch during quiet time, but it ends up being as loud as the others! It gave good suggestions for what kids could do during quiet time... I guess since they wouldn't want to watch the movie again...They say kids stop watching when they are confused. My son apparently got confused, or bored, after only a couple of minutes!We'll hold onto it and maybe he'll like it in a few years :-)"
5,favorite toy,"This kitty is my grandson's favorite stuffed toy. It's just right for a small child to hold and cuddle. The ears and paws are the right size to fit in a little mouth! He has at least five kitties---in case one gets left behind, or is in the wash. They travel with him everywhere and help tuck him in at night. A very cute kitty!"
5,This is one of the most fun games I have ever played!,"This is the real-world version of the tavern game played in D&D.; It is so much fun! My friends and I can play for hours and not even notice the passing of the time.This is for up to six players, but seven may play without too much trouble. The cards are very sturdy, and the artwork on the cards is beautiful. I would not recommend this game for kids under the age of about ten years old, as there is a lot of reading and some strategy and thinking required. For older kids, and adults, this is a ton of fun.If you're looking for a really fun card game that can easily last for a very long time, I highly recommend Three Dragon Ante! My only advice: bring lots of extra poker chips (and don't play with actual money), as running out of money is sometimes very easy in this game."
2,Dry-even for an academic,I teach entrepreneurship so I read lots of books on the topic. Even on a cross country plane flight I could not force myself to finish this one. There are a few good bits but they are buried in a dull mountain of words. If you are curious go to the library or borrow a copy.
4,A discussion of modern torture,"This book is not an exhaustive or in-depth study of torture. That being said, it does present both sides of the debate over the use of torture and its refined definition during the Bush administration. The book is a compilation of articles by various authors that weigh in on the topic. For my purposes, this book served my need to get an overview of the debate very well. It does cover some of the legal implications of the Bush definition of torture, but doesn't really provide much historical background. Of course, the title does not necessarily suggest it would. I would recommend this book as a source for learning about torture and the moral considerations that are at the center of the debate."
5,critically important intellectual material,"Few questions are more relevant to our times than that of the resurrection (as if it had ever actually died!) of judicial torture. No longer safely able to stand tall and insular on its humanistic pedestal, America must face this issue NOW. People think of screws and boots and wedges and coals, but such medievalism is no longer remotely relevant: far more reliable (not to mention quicker) results are obtainable from pharmaceuticals (perhaps--like the death penalty--another issue where the Hippocratic oath is [?] at odds with Dr. Smith's specific actions today). Read, absorb, consider, conjecture, believe."
2,Overflows onto the controls,Purchased one like this that was totally black. Sent it back within a month because it overflowed and ran over the controls and wouldn't come back on. After receiving repaired one it worked for one year and gave up the ghost. Loved the carafe and brewing but would stay away from the controls at the bottom.
2,Big Overflow Problems,"Liked the look and the thermal carafe. Unfortunately, the ""unique lid design"" caused overflow problems from the get-go. Worked ok for my wife the first few times and went all over the counter and floor for me. My wife thought it was my user error and I got a good ribbing. I see from other reviews that overflow problems are not unique to us though.Then it overflowed on her the next three times in a row. Time to eat crow and take this nice looking but bad working unit back. We live at altitude so maybe that has something to do with the airflow and overflow of the lid."
3,Moody coffeemaker,"Like others I have had problems with folded over filters and inexplicable floods of coffee all over the counter. The top of the carafe is difficult to place on correctly. Even when it is on correctly, the coffee still floods sometimes. It's a nice looking unit and the coffee is good but I wouldn't get it again."
1,Mega Floods,"As with everyone else, I too have had the periodic disaster with coffee overflowing from the poorly designed coffee basket/lid. To make matters worse, when this happens, you MUST thorughly clean the grounds out of the CAP...as the cap becomes clogged with grounds when it overflows. If you don't clean it out, it just happens again and again! Makes great coffee, but CAREFULLY get the basket and coffee pot aligned so you don't have a disaster on hand."
1,"Good coffee, bad reliability","I bought this coffeemaker because I wanted one with a thermal carafe. Cuisinart has a good reputation, so I was willing to spend what I thought was a lot of money for a good product...bad idea! The first one was broken right out of the box; I swapped it out for the same product, figuring it was just bad luck. One month later, the second machine broke...just stopped brewing! I emailed Cuisinart, and got no response. I'm supposed to have warranty for the product, but am frankly so disgusted, I'll just trash this expensive, unreliable coffeemaker, and buy another brand. By the way, the coffee it makes is excellent...just wish the machine worked!"
4,Too early to tell.,Bought this for my grandson and hope he likes it. A little small but pieces look durable and do not seem to have small detachable parts.
3,Somewhat useful,"The authors are preeminent psychologists who are well known in the field of EQ Psychology. So the book has lot of credibility. The content, however, was full of fluff. The book's ideas can be summed by what the authors call ""Emotional Blueprint"", and they are:1)Identify emotions (Get complete and accurate emotional data of yourself and others)2)Use Emotions (have feelings help guide your thinking)3)Understand Emotion (Evaluate possible emotional scenarios)4)Manage Emotions (determine underlying, root cause and take action to solve the problem).If you find these enlightening, then you should buy this book. But the ideas can be summarized as ""be aware of the emotions of yourself and others and control them to become a more salient individual""."
1,Good leaders are tough nuts,"The reviewers raving about this book are misguided or they don't know what's going on in the real world. I'm a CEO and have over 5,000 employees. I'm tough as nails but have a moral compass that works. That is the most important thing....as well as a strong business sense to do what's right, treat everyone fairly, set high goals, demand a lot, pay well. I doubt it if Caruso or Salovey ever held a job or if they studied real leaders (seems like they may have done the latter but conveniently selected cases that makes their model seem to work). If you want to know what leaders do buy books written by real leaders. If you want to know what the research says then read real research based on leaders. This book is neither."
1,Simplistic advice,"The advice given in this book is really so banal that I suppose anyone could have written the book. I really don't understand why there has been so much attention given to the concept of emotional intelligence. Seems to me that normal folks are, according to the description of the authors, emotionally intelligent. No need to write books about something that's so obvious. Is it maybe written for those you lack the real intelligence?"
1,Not what it seems to be,"I was led to buy this book because of the abundant praise I read about it. I was sadly disappointed. The content is but an endless repetition of the same basic idea: emotions are important. When we expect the authors to come with a revelation, this is what we find:`Consider a person who has a huge smile on her face. Her eyes are twinkling, her mouth is upturned in a big smile, and she is laughing. How is this person feeling? If you were to say ""angry"" because you felt that it is possible that the person is angry, you would most likely be wrong.'Well, I surely didn't need a ""scientific"" book to tell me that - nor to tell me so many other similar things. I don't tell other readers to avoid this book, but I suggest, if they are disappointed as I am, that they write here what they think of it. It will just improve the publishing market, and will help future customers to beware of too much praise."
1,The emotionally intelligent avoidance,"The book pretends to be scientific, but it's all a delusion. The internal charts are contrived to give the content a ""scientific"" look, but they are so empty and awkward that a mere glance reveals the trick. The ""cases"", which seem in most part fictitious, may be resumed thus: ""Paul didn't understand emotions. Oh, Paul lost his job. Therefore, emotions are important."" The same holds for the quoted researches. ""Dr. So-and-so did extensive research on emotions. He concluded emotions are important."" My advice is this: your money is important. Keep it."
1,First read the reviews,"I would like to warn the reader that the five-stars ""spotlight review"" above doesn't come from a person, but from a company specialized in this kind of activity and called getAbstract. If you really want to know the opinion of readers, I advise you to read some of the reviews below. There are positive and negative ones, and you will certainly see which are the genuine ones. My opinion of the book may be seen by the rate I gave it."
1,Revolting,"I don't know if such a review as mine will be published, but I feel obliged to write it. I ask the readers to skip through the reviews below and to notice a weird fact: this book has received a lot of five stars and a lot of one stars! When I saw it first I didn't know what to think, but having read this unhappy book I know. The praise it received is too ""professional"" to be true (have you ever read back covers?), whereas the comments posted by disappointed readers are just what I felt like writing myself. This book, and something else, is a hoax."
1,Go back to the classics,"As one of the reviewers says below, it seems that a bunch of Caruso's buddies wrote the good reviews, and we the poor folks that bought the book wrote the real (bad) reviews.This book is really not very good. Go back to the classics and read any book by: Bruce Avolio, Warren Bennis, Bernard Bass, Jim Burns, or Marshal Sashkin. Then you'll see the difference in level."
5,My new favorites!,"I just adore these shoes! They're cute cute cute and quite comfortable. They pair well with jeans, skirts, you name it, and the patent leather is of good quality, not the cheap thin kind that one sometimes winds up with. I bought them in yellow and love them so much that I am not trying to buy more yellow items for my wardrobe, just so I can wear these more often!"
4,Not as bad as the others make it out to be!,"The remote works great, it's Infrared, so you have to point it at the right speaker for it to work correctly. The speakers sound great, are plenty big (I'd hate to have bigger speakers!), and have a good aluminum casing."
1,These Speaker are a JOKE!!!!,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
1,MasonWare is the Biggest Joke EVER Stay away,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
1,No autobiography,"During a newspaper interview with Gen. Chuck Yeager in 1989 in San Diego, I asked him about this book, which had just come out a couple years earlier. He told me that Jackie Cochran had nothing to do with this purported autobiography. Cochran had died in 1980, and this book came out in 1987. Yeager - who was a close friend of Cochran and ranks her as one of the best pilots who ever lived - said she didn't leave a manuscript, nor a journal nor a diary. I asked him point-blank if the book was a lie, and he gave me a look and said, ""Just think about what I said."" This book was likely an assemblage of Cochran's quotes from magazine and newspaper interviews she gave through the years, and I have no reason to believe that the words are not her own. But to package it as an ""autobiography"" seems to me a bit of a stretch."
2,smelled bad,"The book was listed as ""good"" condition, but smelled of cigarette smoke and had some staining (coffee??) But it did arrive on time."
1,Dated and Inconsistent,"By default a book of this nature cannot have a long useful lifespan, as the economies, cost of living and even political situations can change considerably from year to year. The information contained in this book is truly dated.Further, items such as relative cost of living and tax implications are not provided consistently for each country covered in the book.Give it a miss!"
2,"great idea, but a bit disappointing","Saw this book in the gift shop of a hotel while traveling, decided to get it on my Kindle when I got back. The premise here is promising, especially with so many Americans living the ideas expressed on HGTV. Seems easy enough to locate. Most of the ideas in the book are pretty obvious; there's no real research done for you, just suggestions of groups and websites to contact for the information. Check lists for things to do for the relocation process. Some budget guidelines. Ok, but a bit repetitive, and nothing you wouldn't know for yourself if you are at all an experienced traveler. Light weight."
5,Wonderfully informative,"This is MUST reading for anyone wanting to make a major move in their lives, but were too confused with the details to do so!!! A fun, informative read for all adults."
5,"Solid, Nuts-and-Bolts Advice for Adults","Filled with practical advice covering both the philosophical (""Don't you love your country?"" objections) and the practical (a recommended cat carrier), Knorr breaks a complicated, life-changing idea into specific, do-able tasks. Anyone who has thought about living overseas for months or years must read this book.Beginning with a personality assessment for the would-be expatriate, Knorr guides the reader through a step-by-step analysis of moving overseas. As the title implies, this is a book for adults who may be encumbered with houses, aging parents, life-long living patterns and other apparent obstacles to making a major life change.Knorr's cautious approach and practical information are designed to produce either a successful sojourn overseas or the avoidance of what might turn out to be an impulsive mistake."
2,A Slim Guide to the Obvious,"There's nothing in this slim, superficial little book you can't discover for yourself in 30 minutes' focused Internet surfing. If you have genuinely never considered even the most basic issues associated with living abroad, and you find value in pronouncements like ""Don't buy a fancy car over there"" or a list of 800 numbers for overseas airlines, you might get some value from this. If you've traveled overseas with some frequency, know the culture you want to join, and now need practical advice on tax and money management, visa and residency requirements, property ownership rules, etc., this book is more or less useless. The author quotes a couple of immediate-circle friends extensively about their move to Portugal but appears to have done little serious research... admittedly it's difficult to write a guide that covers every country you might move to, but be warned this book is really an example of ""once over lightly."""
2,You CAN run away...,You CAN run away without buying this book. I did not learn anything that I didn't already know from my own intelligence and common sense. I was intrigued by the idea of chucking it all and starting anew in Europe. I purchased the book and anxiously awaited its arrival. The enthusiasm with which I began reading shortly waned. Do I really need a book to tell me to submit change of address cards to the post office? I kept waiting for the author's secrets to unfold. There are none in this book. If you want to run away from your current life... you need money and courage and language skills. I should write a book !!!
2,Superficial and obvious,"Although well written and easy to read, there isn't much insight or useful information for someone pondering the issue of retiring outside the country, what the living circumstances might be like, what the alternative countries might be like. Instead, the book gives a chapter called ""Personal Packing for Runaways"" with advice on what sort of clothes to pack for your exit departure. Well, that would depend on where you are going, your wealth, and many other factors. The book's advice is mainly to pack light. The list includes taking a watch, travel alarm, reading material, sunglasses, and camera. Oh, it advises taking ""film"" for the camera, whatever that is. Once upon a time there was something called ""film"" that was used with cameras.The book focuses mostly on Europe, as the author moved to France and gives advice most suited to those with similar interests, which are different from mine."
3,Good for retiring abroad only,"Can't add much to the previous reviews, but be very clear that this book is primarily aimed at people who want to retire OUTSIDE the U.S. It also seems to assume that everyone has lots of money laying around (or own and can sell a home)and they can put that money into CD's and live off the interest. Not all bad, but seems to focus on the few areas of the world that they're most familiar with (France, Portugal, Mexico)"
3,Riveting But Slow,"While I enjoyed Cellular. First of all, Because of the amazing cast. The standout being Jason Statham who plays the charming bad guy. This movie had a lot of action but the plot of the movie started out slow to me. It didn't started getting interesting until the middle of the movie. I would give this movie three-half stars. This is a great rental movie."
5,Give me the charger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was awsome!Very suspenseful,you totally think shes gonna die and that the signal is gonna die.And every time he gets so close to saving the the kidnaped girls family every thing just goes wrong.I am only 11 and i will time you one more time GET IT, WATCH IT, GO OUTSIDE AND SCREAM I LOVE CELLULAR!!!"
4,Surprisingly Fun,"Kim Basinger and Chris Evans star in this 2004 action/adventure film. Basinger is kidnapped without explanation and thrown into a dark basement. Jason Statham plays the ruthless kidnapper who smashes the only phone in the room. But Basinger's character is a science teacher and she quickly gets the phone working but can't dial a specific number. Chris Evans' character, a young slacker, receives her distressing phone call that she's been kidnapped. Something in him snaps, and he suddenly becomes a hero that will stop at nothing to save her and her family. This was a surprisingly fun and exciting movie with plenty of action - and Basinger's character is a strong and smart woman instead of just a helpless victim. William H. Macy also had a great role of a disenchanted police officer who is given the chance to prove himself. Fast-paced and full of thrills, mystery, suspense, and humor - Cellular was one I thoroughly enjoyed."
4,movie Cellular,a good action movie and very funny to watch now in 2012 and see how cell phones used to be.
2,Good movie WRONG RATIO,"PEOPLE BEWARE! I have the DVD edition of Cellular. Its original aspect ratio is 2.35:1. Now, this Blu-ray version has been transfered to a 1.78:1 ratio.I don't really mind that there are none of the extras from the DVD version considering the low price ($6.99 CDN at the video store), BUT the WRONG ASPECT RATIO? That is CRIMINAL especially for Blu-ray."
4,An Action Packed Thriller!!!,"I have been away for a while because we were without electricity for 10 days! We needed to go to my aunt and uncle's house in Paducah to keep warm and we decided to watch this move. Anyway...This is a really good action film! It has an awesome plot about a woman named Jessica Martin being kidnapped for an unknown reason. The main bad guy comes in the room and breaks the phone. She pieces together the broken phone to randomly make a call to a person she has never met. Shecalls Ryan Ackerman. At first, Ryan doesn't believe her, but then he hears her being tortured. From that point, he tries to help her at all costs. Everybody did an awesome job! I highly recommend CELLULAR!!!p.s. My aunt and uncle are awesome!!!"
2,B-grade movie!,"I watched the movie on TV, and thought it was a wise decision not to have bought the DVD. This is a B-grade movie with a few twists here and there to make it appear like an A-grade thriller.Premise: a whole bunch of crooked cops are captured on video committing murder, and they kidnap the family of the guy who caught them on tape. One lonesome guy on a cellphone outwits the gang of cops.I could understand if the movie was made in the early 90's when cell phones were starting to become a part of daily life, but in 2004??...the director must've lost his marbles!Verdict: absolutely un-*&$king-believable!"
3,"Entertaining little 'B' thriller""","""Cellular"" has a ridiculous plot, and the ending is all too predictable. But the energy is high, there are plenty of thrills and chills, and the cast gives its all. The result is a movie which is a great deal of fun.Jessica [Kim Basinger] is a high school science teacher. Never mind that she, her realtor husband and her young child live in a house worth at least two million dollars. It's all about effect here.When Jessica is unexplainably kidnapped, she is taken to an old mansion, where she is thrown into an attic. There she uses an old wall mount phone to try and get help. Dialing random numbers, she finally contacts a young guy [Chris Evans] on a cell phone who agrees to help her. But where is she? She doesn't know, so he doesn't know. Finding and saving her is a daunting prospect.This is not a movie you will view over and over. This is not a movie you will remember years from now. It's a movie you will watch and think, ""That was sort of cool!"""
1,"For a really bad movie, press 1...","There is a major problem with making a movie centered around gee-whiz technology: It almost immediately looks dated. The cell phones used in this cinematic sleeping pill look primitive by today's standards. This could be overlooked if the story was compelling, but this one isn't. It is a totally unbelievable setup that begs the question: ""Dude, why don't you just get this babe's info and call 911?"" Instead our hero fumbles around in a police station that apparently has no police on duty; steals a car; causes numerous traffic accidents; holds up a store at gunpoint; etc., etc., etc. Kim Basinger does her emoting best to add some real drama to this snooze fest, but it is out of place as the whole show is so utterly stupid."
1,Crap,"Quite simply, the whole movie was crap. The acting was crap, the script was crap, the plot was crap. If I had made this movie, I wouldn't admit it. Crap all the way around. Don't waste your time."
2,The cell phone is the main character,"The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it?After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it."
2,Only two reasons to see this move,"!. Jason Statham. He's got a very small role, but even a small dose of him is worth it. Why don't they pick him as the new James bond?!2. Chris Evans shirtless is magnificent.the only two reasons to see this turkey."
5,"Yes, we can hear you now...","""Cellular"" is one of the leanest, meanest thrill rides to hit in quite a while. A taut 95 minutes, there's really not a frame wasted; the action begins with a bang right after the opening credits and continues unabated until the end. While not wholly origninal -- movie geeks will notice traces of ""Panic Room"", ""Strange Days"" and ""Speed"", among others -- ""Cellular"" manages to take its influences and give them a fresh, inventive twist. ""Cellular"" is an active action movie, a thrilling thriller, and just basically FUN, right down to its end credits.(Speaking of ""twists""... avoid the special features page until you've seen the movie; one of the featurette titles is kind of a huge spoiler, if you're up on recent events.)C."
2,"If you like CORN and CHEESE, then feast your eyes!","This movie is just plain lame. Farfetched, cheesy, corny so-called action movie. Kind of a novel concept, but to make a kidnapping action suspense movie out of it just reeks of corn. And BTW, subtitles programmer, ""lose"" is not spelled ""loose""!!!!!!"
2,So bad.,"Don't watch this pathetic movie, it's horrible and I am being kind. Cellular was marketed as a suspense thriller but it is full of fluffy jokes and robotic acting. Chris Evans is nice to look at but he has no emotional depth and Kim Basinger should know better than to pick this as a serious role. The only funny part of Cellular is that Ricky Martin joke and that's it. Don't waste your time on this stinker."
4,I enjoyed it a lot,"Cellular was a very good movie in my opinion. It wasn't great since it was somewhat unrealistic with Jessica (I think that's her name) having the ability to assemble a phone from a crushed mess, but it was really enjoyable.At first it may seem like a really silly movie but it'll have you on the edge of your seat after awhile with the main character (is it ryan?) swerving through traffic and the scenes where he's being chased.I think that you should rent this first and if you like it go ahead and buy it. It wasn't amazingly good so I won't recommend just buying it straight out."
2,"Somewhat entertaining, but really stupid!","If this were meant to be a comedy, I might have liked it more. The acting was terrible, and the story was totally ridiculous and unbelievable! It's very hard to believe that William H. Macy can play any type of tough guy, he's such a dork!"
2,"Plot interesting, several actors were awful","Kim Basinger isn't known for her acting chops, but she does a decent (for her) job in this movie. What amazed me was that Chris Evans was just as hammy and over-acted just like he did in Not Another Teen Movie. Did someone tell him this was supposed to be a comedy? His facial expressions were over the top, and he acted like such a drama queen."
3,Dont Hang Up the Phone just yet,"Alright everyone, we have already had movies made about phone booths so I wasnt surprised when I saw the previews for cellular. What I was surprised about was the fact that I actually was able to prevent myself from hitting the stop button on the remote. It was actually pretty good in a cheesy kind of way. A little far fetched yes, but who doesnt want Kim Bassinger to have a come back role. This wasnt it, but if you are looking for a movie to past the time and you are true movie buff, cellular is a I'm not dissapointed I watched it kinda movie."
3,"Good twist, mediocre characterizations","This film has a bit of a gimmick and it didn't have to be that way. The premise that a stranger calls and the protaganist proves his character by his unrelenting drive to save her is dependent on great characterization. The movie is mainly driven by plot developments. Ryan, the reluctant hero is a bit vanilla and never developed. William Macy as usual saves the show by being compelling in a supporting role. With better dialog this could have been closer to Pulp Fiction than to a Van Demme B movie. The acting is good all around but you never understand the villians. Again, they are just drivers of the plot."
4,"Awesome movie! However, the few ""ethnic"" stereotypyes are borderline offensive!","As a Latino guy, I was somewhat disturbed by the ""three"" stereotypical only-can-speak-spanish Latino people in this movie. One was a maid (aptly named ""Rosario""), a ""bad girl,"" and the other was a young worker. Then there was the Asian guy who spoke with a ridiculous no-one-talks-like-that accent. It's as if this director thought that we Latinos ALL speak with an accent and/or can't speak English. Who the heck is he to do something like that in this movie?I really enjoyed this movie!! I give the movie 4 stars only because of the outdated stereotypes portrayed in this movie. Those of you who are not minorities and think this comment is out of place, well obvisouly you are NOT a minority, and I don't need or want to go to see movies that portray me or other minorities so stereotypically.Many of us minorities are tired of it. The director(s) needs to avoid the stereotypes and stick to the plot! Enough said!"
4,"Very clever plot, but far to be a classic!","This cunning script is real hook for the viewer. From the first shots, we feel that dark and unexplainable tension. The kidnapping does not make wait too long, and from that moment, the set up and edition process will play a very important role. Gradually a obscure web of corruption and power 's abuse will support a very entertained picture without major pretensions. That keeps its objective. Not a classic but, it will not let you down. Perhaps the artificial device of Macy in his unorthodox make up, contributes to work out as a divertimento inside the frenetic rhythm. On the other hand I watched to the always beauty and attractive Mrs. Bassinger, absolutely committed with the role. Well directorial effort"
4,An interesting and fun movie,"Is this movie contrived? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. The comparison with Speed is obvious and both movies are good entertainment. The choice of Chris Evans for the lead was a bit surprising, but he does an adequate job. Kim Basinger looks as beautiful as ever and she demonstrates that she can actually act. Jason Statham has never impressed me with his acting abilities, but he makes an awesome tough guy and he does not disappoint in this film. The movie kept my attension from start to finish so what more could you ask for? Definitely worth a rent."
4,B-Movie done right,"""Cellular"" doesn't waste any time getting to its central premise: a kidnapped woman is stuck in an attic with a broken phone and manages to make a phone call to a total stranger, who must not hang up on her. Nearly everything after that serves mostly to sustain the premise, but each step along the way is plausible. Why doesn't he hang up on her? Why doesn't he just go straight to the cops? Why don't the bad guys kill her? The answers are all reasonable, and sustain interest through to the end. This is a b-movie thriller, but it's never lazy and cheap."
4,This Disc Gives Blu-Ray High Definition Meaning !!!,"Cellular has been one of my favorite action films since it was released Sept.of 2004. since getting my blu-ray player and 1080p high def digital t.v.i've been waiting for it to come out on blu-ray. now quite recently i lookedon Amazon and didn't see it listed. but last week i looked again and it waslisted as actually being available. i ordered it and got it yesterday and watchedit last nite.The intense crispness, clarity and sharpness of both the picture image and themulti-channel audio tracks was mindblowing. exactly what you expect from a blu-raydisc. but there are two flaws if you will.1.its not the official U.S. release but a Canadian import. none of the extrason the original dvd from New Line Cinema are included.2.there isn't even a scene selection option and the film playsautomatically and when its over starts to play again. this seemsa strange way to burn a blu-ray disc."
3,"Chris Evans - Good Man, Jason Statham - Bad Man!","A surprisingly good performance by Chris Evans (Ryan), who's the somewhat dorky, macho dude; against the convincingly evil, badman kidnapper, Jason Statham (Ethan). Kim Basinger plays Jessica Martin; a panicked, desperate, tortured, but determined and very ingenious wife of the hunted husband. She also comes up in the clutch as the movie progresses.The action is fast and sometimes hilarious, with Evans doing the footwork (via his cell phone) in various impossible situations trying to help Basinger (especially when he needs to recharge his phone - a real doozy of a scene). William Macy is Detective Mooney, who eventually puts the pieces of the puzzle together while Ryan (Evans) traverses all over town creating mayhem all his own, while attempting to foil the kidnappers.Good acting (and action) by Chris Evans, with able support from Basinger, Macy and Statham. A surprisingly entertaining movie."
4,A surprisingly good film,"When Cellular first hit the theatres, it had all the marks of a B film, unknown male lead, fledging female Oscar winner, and talented odd-ball William H. Macy. However, when you watch this film, you realize that it doesn't deserve it's B class status. This is a really good action-suspense story with a viable and nearly realistic storyline. It doesn't even loses it entertainment value when you watch a second time. I do like that Kim Basinger isn't a helpless damsel in distress. She is an active participant in her and her family's rescue. Overall: This movie is worth your time."
5,GRIPPING,"I truly enjoyed this movie. Here we have a normal family, living their lives and poof out of nowhere they are thrust into a living hell. How wouldyou like to be taking a video and come upon some very evil cops killing people and now you have the evidence? Not a good spot to be in. They know who you are and they want that tape back or your entire family will be killed; not that they won't be killed anyway.Kim Basinger is excellent in her role, desperately using his wits and putting together a phone line to call for help. She reaches one number, Brians cell phone and now Brian has to race against time to save her and her entire family.I liked this movie. It was not gory or sexy, just plain suspenseful right to the end. I believe you will enjoy it. I know I did."
1,So bad it's laughable.,"Seriously, this is one of, if not the worst movies I've seen. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is even worse, and the plot seems severely thrown together. This all adds up to making this movie entirely unbelievable. There's little to no character development and you honestly couldn't care if Kim Basinger's character makes it or not. In fact, I wished she hadn't have so she wouldn't have to repeat the same exact lines over and over again. Nothing in this movie is realistic and nothing in it makes you care about it.So if some reason you feel overly compelled to see this movie, please, rent before you buy. You won't regret it. In fact, you might get a laugh out of how utterly bad this movie is."
1,Cellular,I have seen the movie before on cable and enjoyed it. The video however had areas on the disc that was not viewable and thus not enjoyable. I understand that this happens upon occasion but is still frustrating. I would like to have information on how to return this movie.
5,CELLULAR IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Ok let me just say this I saw the movie cellular yesterday. In fact, I loved it so much that I bought it right away. I thought the cast was perfect for the film, and chris evans played a great role as a normal kid just answering his cell phone. This movie was action packed, full of suspense, and laughter. I would definatly reccomend it to anyone who really wants to see a great movie. I just love the idea of a random kid that has to save this womans family. The movie really works the story is great and the action really leaves you on the edge of your seat. Whoever said that this movie sucks needs serious help because it is awesome. I hope this one has long distance and extra minutes- Andrew"
4,hmm...,i actually liked this movie though at the beginning i wasnt sure if i would for one reason...kim basinger's character was poorly done....i thought i was gunna go insane watching her play a really crappy character in a really crappy way...but its liveable and doesnt ruin the movie completely. its definitely worth watching and some may like some may not but i found it to be ok!
5,Dial 'M' for Cellular !,"I LOVED this movie. An updated old fashioned style 'Hitchcock' movie for the new millenium. Think 'Dial 'M' for Murder' 21st century style !Chris Evans will be the next Tom Cruise, there is no doubt, with a charisma Cruise has not achieved since 'Risky Business'.Kim Basinger is a tad unconvincing in parts, but gets better as the movie progresees. Plus you have to remember, she is the 'B' movie queen (remember Attack of the 50ft Woman???)So by those standards this performance is Oscar winning!! Seriously, this movie has everything, car chases, suspense, surprises and even a few hot bodies thrown in for good measure.Rent it...buy it....and be prepared to sit glued to the screen for the duration of this 5 star thriller !"
3,Jason Statham!!!!,"Jason Statham is the only reason that I watched this movie in the first place. I think he's one of the most underrated action stars around. Surprisingly, the movie itself really wasn't that bad. It was good...not great..but good. I would run out and buy it though. It's a little far-fetched, but far-fetched is entertaining. To look for plausibility in a movie would destroy the premise of 90% of the movies that Hollywood has to offer us these days anyway. So now, I just look for entertainment value. This movie was entertaining to say the least."
4,"Not As Good As ""Phone Booth"", but it's alright.","I think this movie is very original. The plots are very enjoyable. But the acting is a little poor. If you like original movies in which you do not know what is going to happen, watch this one. If you like a little more suspense, thriller and a touch of violence, watch ""Phone Booth"", a true masterpiece, for me."
2,RE: Subpar at best,"William H. Macy and Kim Basinger must have needed the money. I was a fan of ""Phone Booth,"" the screenwriters' first script, but this one falls short. The dialouge is not only up with the cheesiest of the year, but lacks anything close to substance. I lost count of the plot holes, and the story just seemed a little too far-fetched. The director had 2 great talents with Macy and Basinger and came up with what had to be some of the worst performances of both actors' careers. Please don't waste your time, because I did for you."
1,Ugh,"I see a number of five star reviews for this film. We can'tgive any film a higher rating than five stars, so that meansthere are people here on earth who rank this movie withRashomon, Sullivan's Travels, Children of Paradise,and Dr. Strangelove - when in fact it's about as estimableas an episode of Starsky and Hutch.The most irksome thing about Cellular is the completeabsence of accountability for the crimes committed by itsprotagonist, Ryan. Let's see: armed robbery, auto theft,willful damage to property, reckless driving - that results ininnumerable automobile acidents ( which surely causedserious injuries ), resisting arrest, etc. He swipes a man'sPorche ( at gun point ) - and apparently the director thinksthis is OK because the Porsche's owner is a repugnantlawyer...Ryan gets away with everything, and winds upwith the babe on the pier.There's another annoyance, smaller, but annoying never-the-less. Jessica says that her husband is a real-a-tor...Bill Macy is very good, as always."
1,Horrible,"this is the only movie whre I walked out of the theater. The worst acting ever. For a better time, go to the dentist."
2,I was going to give this 5 stars,"I thought this was a comedy, because I was laughing the entire movie. It seemed like a great parody of suspense thrillers. But then I was informed that it was actually supposed to be a suspense thriller. So I guess the acting was supposed to be terrible. Even Kim Basinger didn't seem that great. Poor William H. Macy, he deserves so much better."
2,Not worth wasting too many long distance minutes on,"William H. Macy is becoming like Christopher Walken in that he just makes movies that shouldn't be that good at all a little more bearable. Case in point, Cellular where he plays a police officer who really wants to start a dayspa. He meets a normal joe, Ryan (Chris Evans), who has this woman, Jessica (Kim Basinger), on his cell phone who says she's been kidnapped. The entire movie consists of Ryan running around town, trying to help this poor woman, and usually screwing up.Yes, if you watch it you'll find out why she was kidnapped, and before you can say ""improbable shootouts"" and ""high speed car chases,"" it's over. The film does have one good gimmick (the cell phone) and a good bit humor to make it worthy of a cheap rental or a cable viewing. Just don't waste too much on it.2.5"
5,great tunes,"The greatest cd I purchesed in a long time, If you're looking for rock & roll that makes you want to jump around, this is it!! should be played on the radio!!Thanks!"
4,Great job,"Excellent feel, catchy hooks and great sing-along choruses. A rousing 12-bar good-time stomp."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book when I read Mr. Klawan's excerpt in Newsweek, but I have to say that the book disappointed me more often than not. The author seems determined to show us how educated he is by drawing parallels between these out-of-control films and the history of popular culture in the world society. All that really does is detract from his main throughline. The best passages were the ones regarding ""Cleopatra"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". The rest were interesting, but most of the time I was lost."
3,Nice layout but poor workmanship,I ordered two of these because the design has been discontinued. They must be factory seconds as the drilled holes had errors in spacing and alignment on both board. Inasmuch as they were not marked factory second I must lower the rating.
3,Cribbage,"Got this as a gift for my elderly parents, so I can't really review too well. What I saw of it, well made and fun."
4,Great for budding artists!,"My toddler loves to paint. She enjoys variety and was drawn to these sponge style brushes. I bought this mainly for the rollers and she's had fun with them. They're a little flimsy, but for the price I wasn't expecting much. I'm not sure how long the brushes will last with a toddler dragging them across paper, but so far so good. Lots of fun with very little investment. They also clean up very easily."
3,Cute,Not really much fun for a 4 year old. The end product is cute but not a lot of creativity involved
3,Doesn't last long and makes quite a mess!,"My 2 yr old LOVES to paint and is quite neat at it, so I gave these a try... bad idea. They are bulky, soak up a ton of paint unevenly and then glops it on the paper... what a mess! It didn't exactly make the patterns, even when i applied the paint... worse off, paint went everywhere, dripping off these brushes.. They cleaned OK for one try, but stained them with the colors we used.... maybe for an older kid who knows, but can't really ""paint"" with them, you lose fine motor skills and imagination... i wouldn't buy them again."
3,Great for a season,"These do what they say. They are great for kids who love to paint. We used them all summer but they won't last for another season. The sponge isn't extremely thick and you can't expect it to last on the stick after using, washing and drying. It eventually is too much wear. I'm sure we'll buy these or something else similar again to replace the ones we have. We need something beyond brushes. We paint weekly outside in the summer."
4,Christian Notetakers Journal,beautifully bound journal with space for sermon notes and other musings. my only complaint is that i asked specifically for the burgundy color -- even made a phone call requesting burgundy -- but I got black : ( What's the point in advertising two colors if a person can't choose??
5,Journal,It was fabulous quality especially for the reasonable price! I bought it as a gift for my husband and he likes it very well. It has ample space and many different sections to use. Arrived in a short amount of time. Very happy with the product overall.
5,Notebook,"Instead of a three ring binder, this is a better alternative. Keep your sermon notes and/or Bible studies in one notebook. This notebook was recommended by a fellow church member and I also would highly recommend it as well. There are also other sections that could be utilized in your Christian walk."
2,Don't Hold Your Breath On This One ...,"Adele Morales (who insists on keeping her famous ex husband's name- she is one of several wives) took the plunge into exploiting her husband's name and tremendous literary reputation with the apparent hope/expectation that by revealing the details of their marital years, she would also profit. She has no journalistic saavy, apparently limited intelligence as she fails to deliver the gory scoop that the jacket promises. Instead she indulges in extolling her own deluded and narcissistic virtues (as she perceives them) and guys, it's tiresome. Her way of putting words together and general idea conveyance leaves much to be desired, which strikes me with wry irony because the level of Norman Mailer's genius renders his taste in this woman laughable. Sadly, at the climax of her ""epic torture"" I found myself commiserating with her husband- after all, he had to put up with her for too long."
4,Very Insightful,This book is great for anyone interested in the development of new ideas. When all of these writings are taken as a whole you can really appreciate what each revolutionary was trying to convey. A great read and very well priced.
2,Absurd,"The works contained within are testament to the genius of man, and also the stupidity.I find it mildly offensive that such a degrading piece of work such as the Communist Manifesto be included in the same binding with the Declaration of Independence."
2,State Fair Bingo,"not satisfied with purchase, game board is not complete, it contains twoidentical pieces instead of the correct one. Was not listed in description.Would not buy from this person again."
3,fun but cheaply made,"I bought this product for my Dad for Christmas. Like I was hoping, he opened it and wanted to play it immediately. On the first turn of the ball the little ball on the handle fell off. Also the Cards that come with it have sliders so you can mark off the numbers, well most of them were stuck and were very difficult to pull over or put back into place. Other than that we enjoyed it. It just seemed cheaply made for how expensive it is."
1,Poor Quality,"We love Bingo and bought this set instead of the cheaper sets. It was unusable the day it was opened due to warped bingo cards. The clear sliders that allow you to mark you card would barely move on nearly every card. A shame because the rest of the unit seemed decent. Sure, the ball cage was a bit cheap but the rest was decent. Yet another poorly built product on the market. Why not build things right and charge a bit more?"
4,Bingo,"Bought this game to play @the cabin up north when my sisters & I have our girls weekend and it was a big hit,( we are all over 50) great way to have some fun without spending any money ! I previously purchased a cheaper game & the markers were so small you could hardly pick them up ! So over all money well spent !"
1,Poor Quality,"Bingo balls unreadable. Bingo card windows hard to open and shut. Ball numbers were etched but not blackened as shown in the picture, very, very hard to read. Bingo carboard cards were bent/warped making it hard to open/close the windows."
2,Bad shutter cards,After a night of Bingo with friends and family decided to make an impulse buy and purchased this item. It arrived today and the shutter cards are warped and do not work very well. The manufacturer recommended I return it to Amazon and get another. I would rather return it to get my money back as I have no idea if the next one would be any better. I should have just bought a Bingo set without shutter cards and saved some money.
2,"The Good, Bad and the Ugly","As stated by other reviewers, some of the balls were hard to read and needed to be marked with pen and ink -- I used a Sharpie. That was not a problem, just an inconvenience. The ONLY problem was that the latch to keep the balls inside the container does NOT stay closed. Without applying a twist-on and -off tie, the balls will fall out with each turn of the handle -- a shamefully poor design, especially for the price. Caveat emptor!"
3,OK,I ordered this for my bank who hosts events for senior citizens. The balls are hard to read the numbers on and the balls fell out of the cage before rolling out. I saw this exact same product at World Market this weekend for $24.95.
4,Bingo Set,The bingo balls and cage are very durable. The numbers/letters etched in balls are hard to read so I took a brown sharpie to make them darker. The cards that come with set are unusable since they have slide covers which are hard to move. The set is good but you really need to purchase cards and bingo covers separately.
5,Classic is a hit,This bingo game is sturdy and very nostalgic. Was a hit at our Christmas Eve party where we used it to determine who got to pick a gift during the gift exchange.
2,Front Porch Classics State Fair Bingo,"I don't think that this product was inspected before it was shipped because the wire container that holds the balls was incomplete. The hole where the balls exit was about 2 inches square, causing it to drop approximately 5 balls at once going everywhere instead of on the slot. I had to fill in the area with electrical wire.It works at 80% now."
1,Balls very low quality.,The balls are not even round in some cases. One even falls threw the cage. So really not worth anything. Ended up using a free computer program online to call the balls. Do not wast your money.
5,Great!,"Just had to darken all the numbers, but that was no big deal. Great Product and I love it a lot!"
3,Rating for Front Porch Bingo,The last hole on the board was not routered out - I found someone to do this for me. The metal holder was bent at the base and did not sit flat on the table - I attached it to a board.
3,good,This product is good. The only issue found as far is the latch on the door of the ball cage will not latch.
3,Its okay,This was bought to use at family fun times... The bingo ball cage ball latch sometimes opens... no big deal... Some of the balls the ink is very light an them and not easily read... again no big deal... The main problem I have with it is the cards.. They are crap... The plastic slides are hard to move over to cover the number and sometimes will pop out. I would recommend getting different cards to go with this if you are buying it...
3,Bingo,This bingo set has a good quality cage. The cards and chip are a bonus as I have an old bingo set. However the numbers on the balls are hard to read.
5,Great game for kids,I care for several school age kids at my house and playing Bingo is always a big hit and very popular when the weather doesn't permit outside play.
3,Bingo is Bingo,"My son, learning of Bingo at his grandmother's senior housing apartment complex, loves it. He had always wanted to be the one calling out the numbers and he now is.The wheel works great and nicely dispences one numberered sphere at a time;Some of the sphere markings make it difficult to actually read the letter and number. Fortunately, one can easily deduce whatever is missing;Large wooden block with concave spots for the spheres is nice.Just as the Signature Edition has the traditional, ""old,"" look to it, some of the numbers on the cards are off-set and difficult to read.Also, I was surprised that a new set like this had windows that were difficult to slide open and closed."
1,shoddy construction,"My wife was delighted to open the package, when this bingo game arrived. Within minutes, she had discovered that the door into the wire drum did not stay closed, when the drum was rotated. After picking all of the balls up off the floor, we re-packed the game and returned it.If all of these items are constructed this badly, then people will be wasting their money. Stay away from it."
4,Great Book!!,"I am not sure what some of the other reader's issue are with this book being a reprint (and who cares), I think this book had just the right amount of suspense and romance. I really liked the fact that you got to know all of the characters in this book and their history. This book takes you in the beginning when the characters are all young teenagers, which sets the major plot for the story. The second half of the book is sixteen or seventeen years later and shows you what has become of the characters and how dramatically their lives have been effected by the unsolved murders . I really liked the twist this book had in the end, and I found myself speed reading to get to the end just so I could find out who the culprit was. I highly recommend this book!"
2,It says very clearly on the cover,"that this book is a reprint,and granted the type is small, but it's there on the front plain as day, also if you look at the copywrite date it says it was first published in 1995, i think, but this book was NOT released just a year ago, it's been several years. The writer talks for quite a bit in the author's note about the fact this is the same book with a few added scenes. There was no attempt to hide that this is a reprint."
3,Not her best,"This is not one of my favorites...I loved Deep Freeze and am eagerly anticipating the release of Fatal Burn. I've also liked others that she's written. This one just had so much.....misery. And it was hard to care about the characters, even the heroine. If you're looking for a good Lisa Jackson, try one of the others."
5,Yet another favorite,"Far and few between are the books that possess the ability to seizes my attention. The story's plot must be intense and continuous, a page turning, day burning ride for my mind. I thought that H Jay Scheuermann (author of The Gore Experiment/Paint Me As I Am) was my new all time favorite, but I've found that there's room for two at the top of my list. I recommend this book and author to anyone ready for an incredible read"
3,Fun to play with,This toy is shooting soft rubber discs and it is amuzing to play with it . My son likes it.
5,Hymns by Johnny Cash,"I bought this CD because it includes the song ""I Saw a Man"" which is notin Johnny's newer recordings. I am delighted with the CD.Excellent quality and arrive in good shape."
4,Obscure but potent trio set from 1991,"This trio set is on an obscure label, but the music is powerful and representative of McCoy's live sound circa 1990 onward, combining his progressive technique with mainstream tradition. Avery Sharpe's aggressive fretless electric bass style is also well presented. Drummer Louis Hayes completes the power trio, with Babatunde's colorful percussion on several tracks creating the impression of a larger group. The group performs a couple of basic but upbeat compositions by McCoy (the title track and ""Blues for Basie""), Sharpe's ""Berliner"", and four melodic standards, including Bonfa & Jobim's haunting ""Manha de Carnaval"". Worth seeking out for Tyner fans."
2,"Great idea, badly made","I also loved the coffee, but only had the coffeemaker for a short time. The glass shattered within a month (Cuisinart wouldn't help me at all). I bought a new plastic carafe, and within a week of getting it, the electronics started to go. It just wouldn't turn on most mornings. After a touchy week, it died.I would love to get another because I loved the idea so was checking out the site to see if others had similar problems. Cuisinart didn't seem to care at all, which was a bummer."
2,Worked great for a while,"This is a really great product...if only it worked longer than a few months. Worked great for the first 3 months I had it, now it reads a constant 10 degrees higher than what the temperature really is. I've tested the water with 3 other thermometers and they all ready 79.5 F while the TOM Aquarium Temp Alert reads 88.7 F. I would pass on this product"
2,Not very useful,"The one reason why I'm giving it such a low rating is because of its length. I always fly Cathay Pacific and American Airline. Every time when they have the appropriate outlet for use with this adapter, it is always located under the seat. The cable at its longest is never long enough for me to leave my laptop on the small desk, meaning it can only stay on my lap. I dunno what to do about it :("
5,Imagine your mother has just died after giving birth.,"Imagine your mother has just died after giving birth. You go to the hospital to pick up your sister to find she has been taken by welfare workers and put in a home. Imagine you are that baby, that you grow up never knowing how badly your family missed you. Imagine being an older kid in the home, an 'aunt' to this 'special baby', only to later lose contact with her; yet another separation. This is the story of Doris Kartinyeri who spent the first 14 years of her life in a home for children taken from their Aboriginal families. But it is also the story of her sister Doreen and her 'antie' Lowtja O'Donoghue and the family she only later came to know. The ripples of Kartinyeri's pain can be see spreading through a wide community. Kartinyeri writes simply, directly and movingly of her experiences, her struggle to reconnect with her people and her battle with bi-polar disorder.- Fiona Capp, Age"
2,Don't go flying,"This is my comfy library chair, but must use caution when getting out of it. If you lean foreward while seated, the chair pitches you out face first! I am a small person, and others have also experienced it."
2,"Comfortable, but not durable","Used it once, and it jammed open and will not fold up...not very usefull for camping or the beach."
5,Very nice,"The dining set is very nice and is just as pictured. When we received the set, one of the chair legs was damaged. The manufacturer was quick to send a replacement piece via FedEx. We now have the complete set and are very happy with it."
3,Its was just okay.,"Quality wasn't that high. Manufacturing defects give the furniture a ""look what I made in my garage"" feel. Something I would expect to find at Walmart for half the price. Everything assembled fine. Finish was okay.Shipping was fast and well protected. We ended up adding foam and fabric to the seat. Would I buy it again? Probably. There are little to no, table/chairs like it available."
4,8 Horror Flicks for a Cheap Price!,"I bought the 8 Films to Die for After Dark Horrorfest 2 disc set at my local Walmart for only $5.00, which isn't bad for 8 movies. I've only watched The Broken and Slaughter so far, but I'm impressed with the video quality considering there are four movies on each disc.The movies are:Disc 1:Autopsy (unrated; 2008)Slaughter (Rated R; 2008)The Broken (Rated R; 2008)The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations (Rated R; 2008)Disc 2:Perkins' 14 (Rated R; 2009)Voices (Rated R; 2008)Dying Breed (Rated R; 2008)From Within (Rated R; 2007)"
4,8 good movies for one low price,"OK Im not going into the plot and summary for each movie, however I will say that all these movies are worth seeing. And for the price I paid ($8) I ended up getting a great deal. Most of these movies are filled with strange characters, suspense, terror, gore, blood, witty dialogue, clever plots, and nerve wrecking endings, Particularly the 2 that stand out the most are Butterfly effect 2, which was way better then the first two and then you have ""Broken"" which is a creepy dark movie that involves mirrors and parallel universes. These 2 alone are worth the price u pay and consider the rest of the 6 just a bonus.The film quality is quite good . If youre a collector of scary movies this set of 8 would make a nice little addition. Oh yeah be warned some of these movies contain adult situations like foul language and female nudity."
3,its decent,"i wasn't expecting anything from this at all. i just wanted to watch something that had a little bit of suspense and scares in it. it had a bit more than that as the deaths were a bit much other folks might want to be wary of those. the story while nothing really special serves it's purpose. I can see why ""Somebody.."" was a DVD release and might be best watched via rent first. But check it out for yourself and then decide after that. Nothing spectacular or anything, but better than a lot of crap i've seen recently...also leaves it open for a sequel."
3,It was & Ok Movie not bad.,I would say its a good movie to rent not buy. Unless you buy at blockbuster for 4 DVD's for $20.00.
2,Meh,"A group of friend vacationing at a cabin in the woods for the weekend for one of their birthdays are menaced by an evil plastic surgeon.Feautering a bevy of characters, none of which I cared about, getting killed by one of the more lame serial killers of recent memory, this putrid horror film by the director who killed the House Party franchise, this putrid film isn't worth the time spent reviewing it."
3,Too much wax,"The soap and wax combination did a very nice job cleaning the car, both metal and plastic parts. However if you don't wipe off the windows it left a spotty residue that I found difficult to remove. I assume it was the wax. This product didn't work for me. I'll go back to just soap with no wax, and wax it myself with a liquid spray."
3,not a bad disaster book,"as disaster novels go, this one picks a disaster not too much touched upon, the new madrid fault zone. it's not as well known as california, though if you've taken any geology classes you know that this is the biggest, and has the most potential for destruction. some of the science seemed pretty good, some seemed pretty bad. the characters weren't all that great. the best thing about this book is drawing attention to the new madrid area."
4,"At last, a factually based earthquake disaster book","Many readers will be unfamiliar with the New Madrid Seizmic Zone (unless they studied geology in college, as I did). This book's factually researched action will not only bring New Madrid's history and current threat to life, it will have readers checking maps to make sure *they* don't live in the New Madrid Zone. I couldn't put this book down. Note: the scientific facts presented in this novel might seem incomprehensible to the lay reader, but the information imparted not only educates but helps advance the plot."
3,Fast Paced and factual,"The book was very fast paced and hard to put down. The research was totally supberb and explained in very simplistic terms. The characters could have used a little more developing and the ending did leave a couple of unanswered questions, but overall the book was nonstop and hard to put down. Living in the area of the ""zone"" this book has opened my eyes to the potential danger that is lurking just below the surface."
1,The Earth Didn't Shake When I Read It,"If you want a vague idea about what life will be like in the U.S. when a big earthquake hits, don't bother to read this book. All the one-dimensional, stereotypical scientists in this book are doing is running around from one implausible location to another."
2,A yawner.,"A formulaic disaster story that takes too long to build up to the Big Event. The main characters were bland and boring, and I lost interest early on. I then skipped to the end, and the payoff wasn't enough to justify sitting through the entire thing. (A better, more suspenseful earthquake-type novel would be Ken Follett's ""The Hammer of Eden"".)"
4,A Ripping Good Yarn,"The author could use a bit of work on his chops in terms of creating and sustaining narrative tension, but overall a ripping good yarn. Warm, believable characters and lots of interesting earthquake lore (I used to be a geology major a million years ago, and at least the stuff I remember, he got right).I guess how much you will enjoy this book depends on whether you concentrate on its flaws or its strengths. I found it quite entertaining. My suspicion is that it would have taken a much longer book to cover as much ground as this one does while fully developing all the plot elements, and that unless you're Stephen King, you don't get to publish 1100-page novels."
4,Scary - From a person that grew up along New Madrid Fault,"I grew up around Mayfield and Paducah Kentucky, so this book addressed a lot of my worries, such as Kentucky Dam, and the Nuclear Gas plant in Paducah. I thought it was fast paced and I enjoyed it. Though I didn't like the ideal of them exploding a Nuke in Kaler, KY. hahah"
2,I Tried,"Technical research was great- living in a fault area I found it to be the most, only, interesting aspect. I normally drop a book if after 100 pages my desire to read on is not there. I stayed for 200 pages so must give the 2 star rating. The short paragraphing, jumping too quickly from scene to scene found me leafing through instead of reading through. I am eagerly waiting for ""The Rift"" to compare two authors approaches to the same catastrophe."
4,This should shake you up!,"I've known about the New Madrid Seismic Zone for sometime, but I never realized how catastrophic this area could be. The story is fast pased and factual, giving clear explanations of seismic activity and its aftermath. The best thing I can say for a book is when it inspires me to look up more information on the subject. This is just such a book."
3,Great reference for people who concentrate in the region,Good reference book for a researcher. This book is fairly well put together and provides tons of information. Some of the orginization is confussing and the charted information can be difficult to translate. Information is broken down by country so it is very useful in that respect. Traditional maps are minimal.
4,Good one!,"This book is not for beginners and needs careful reading. I'm sure, After reading this book you will know more about C++ and better ways of using C++."
5,A Gem - I Have Never Slept Better!,"This DVD has been a life saver! I have a some family issues and stress at work that have literally caused me to loose sleep and be tense throughout the day. I have tried sleeping pills, but I don't like the side effects. This DVD has helped me get a good night sleep again. It's so simple but effective. I only wish I tried this years ago and I could get all those hours of sleep back. I have begun doing the morning workouts as well and my overall calm during the day has been greatly enhanced. I am giving this DVD to several people for X-mas!"
5,Energize and Relax,"I have gotten into the habit of using this alot in the morning since it has routines that are short enough to do, depending on the time. I am really impressed in how much better I feel just doing even some of these smaller routines. She is great and obviously knows how to do yoga based on how much this has helped. Beautiful video that is good for pretty much everyone."
5,am/pm yoga for beginners,After viewing this video.... I found it to be an excellent video for the beginner so I bought it as a gift..... The person was so enthused that they joined a yoga school and recommended this video to other students..
3,Yoga DVD,I learned a couple of poses from this but it isn't exactly what I expected. I'm not sure what I expected - but it is really pretty good for relaxing.
2,Not a fan!,"I really don't like this DVD very much. They have select poses and stretches that they just cut and edit to and put together making the ""10 + routines"" The cutting and editing doesn't make for good flowing routines. They don't prep saying ""This is what you'll need during this routine"" so you're grabbing things, getting out of the position quickly, etc... Also, You're laying down, they you have to stand up quickly to get to the next pose which puts a lot of strain on your body. The cutting and editing doesn't help you to know what is coming next. I would much rather have a boring dvd with 1 morning routine and 1 night routine where you see the instructor the whole time doing what your doing and it actually flows and you get to the next position in the least straining way possible. Versus the up, down, up, down, up, down of this one!"
2,Not Impressed!,I'm not a big fan of this DVD! It is very broken up and doesn't have a good flow to it at all. The music stops with each position change. I've also never heard anyone talk all the way through savasana - it's supposed to be the relaxation/meditation pose. I find it really annoying on this DVD.
3,"Lots of Options, but not as easy as the ""Beginners"" tag leads you to believe.","I know that you can't dumb down yoga too much, or you're just touching your toes. But, I felt a bit like a pretzel even in the beginning routines. The great thing about this DVD is that there are myriad programs. So, it gives you a lot to do for a great price. I just thought it would lead you in a little easier."
3,yoga or meditation?,This product is great for meditating and has very little yoga. So if youlike meditating then this product is great but if you are the yoga type of person like me it isn't the best.
3,Self Improvement,I'm sure I'll like it once I take to time to actually use it. I did watch the segment with The Dali Lama & enjoyed it very much.
5,Excellent,"Excellent DVD for a beginner like me. I started with Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies to learn in greater detail positioning of 12 poses (and good yoga information), and moved on to Benagh's Beginning Yoga DVD, which is especially good for learning deeply the Sun Salutation. Then, I graduated to this DVD. Love the music that has been added to the already healing sound of the waves. Great routines that vary in length, allowing me to choose which will fit into my sometimes hectic days. Her verbal guidance and cues are helpful and supportive throughout. Her yoga poses are also an inspiration. Highly recommend."
5,Best DVD for Beginning Yoga,"This DVD has a good variety of Yoga exercises, taking into consideration the various times of day I may want to do them, and also offers different lengths of time that I have to do them within. This gives a sense of personalization and having options. The workouts are moderate. I am very satisfied with this purchase. It is not the same ol same ol at all."
4,Great for beginners,"I purchased this dvd so I could get back to doing yoga after three years away. I didn't practice regularly even then, but I was certainly more flexible. Well, this dvd has increased my flexibility. The PM section really helps me to get a good nights rest and relax my strained muscles after AM kick boxing. I did not give it five stars because there is a PM portion that has you sitting then standing, then sitting and standing yet again. There seems to be no flow there. There is a lot of breathe work which is great for relaxation, however, I am now ready to do more positions. Overall this is a good dvd and will purchase the next one which I hope will be more challenging."
2,Another Bio on Erwin Rommel,"Really did not learn anything new about Field Marshall Rommel. The book seemed to just be repetition of other, better, biographies on Rommel. When I read a bio on someone as famous as Rommel I expect to either learn something new about him or at least see him from a new point of view. This book did neither in a very bland way. Skip it and read one of the better bios on Rommel."
4,Rommel Murder,This book was very enlightening and I enjoyed reading it very much. It pertained to my childhood in Germany and since I was born a Schwabian it would have been nice to see the word spelled correctly in the book.Jeanne Thomaston
4,Discovering the Rommel Murder.,This is a very interesting read. The letters to home was especially informative. The letters showed Rommel to be a normal person as well as a warrior. I recommend this book to all war historians.
4,Interesting,Was very interested in the subject. The author gives insight into the Field Marshall. He also provides good insight into post war Germany .
2,Mainly Letters to His Wife,"This is not so much a bio as just a compilation of letters from Rommel to his wife. Interesting on some level, but not much."
3,Rommel,"I have been a history buff, American, German, etc., for many years and I enjoy reading about WWII (I am a WWII vet). To me the Rommel book was just so so, nothing new sometimes dull. I personally don't like authors talking about how smart/great they are."
3,confusing,The story was very interesting. However following the names of officiers and there relationship to Rommel was sometimes confusing. The multiple time frames did not help. Overall a good book.
5,Excellent product - exactly as described,"Great value - and these are in fact made of a relatively rigid white cardboard, with a self-adhesive strip, as well as two tabs for easy opening.I've been using them with great success in mailing my new CD out to radio stations, etc - my CD is not in a jewel case, but the more slim ECO wallet design."
5,This is just what I wanted,The mailer is just that right size for 1 CD or DVD and can then be mailed for $.85. I was very pleased
5,"great quality, think paper","what can you say in a review about envelopes :) These are great, good quality, thick paper that gives the CD good protection. The perfect mailer when sending out CD or DVDs that you burned. I'm sure there are less expensive ones, but as always you get what you pay for."
5,"Perfect For my 5.25"" cd product","I needed an inexpensive but secure mailer envelope for my cd product.This item works perfect for that.Durable,with folding flap at top.Has adhesive strip ready to go,just take the strip cover off and seal."
4,Great for shipping,"So glad to find these as they are great for shipping, much easier to use. Glad I was able to find them."
3,Amazon Sells Mailers NOT subject to Surcharge,I found a mailer by PostageSaver that is NOT subject to the $.20 per unit surcharge. If you mail one disc it only costs $.44 each for First Class postage. Each pack of mailers comes with a letter from the post office which you can use as proof that no surcharge is due on these mailers. The mailers are sold and fulfilled by Amazon. Put PostageSaver in the Amazon search box to find them.
5,Great!,"It works, and it's cheap! The cutting edge could be a little sharper, but I can't complain. Great product at a great price!"
4,Punch Down Tool,Great product at reasonable price. Works exactly as described and does a nice clean job of cutting off excess wire.
2,Edited version is impossible to read,"I ordered on Kindle, and I wonder if I got a real full book. I understand this is an edited/pared down version of a larger book-- but the paragraphs are so fragmented, I don't understand them. There is no introduction in the book, no transitions between paragraphs, or any clear structure or outline. I am very educated and read fairly complex books-- and I simply do not comprehend this book.I was hoping for a great historical summary before going to Barcelona, but I guess this won't be it."
4,A quick introduction to a fascinating city,"I brought this book along with me on my honeymoon to Paris and Barcelona and started reading it on our overnight train to Barcelona. I finished it in about four hours of reading, closing it just before getting in a cab to our Barcelona hotel.Barcelona: The Great Enchantress is a page turner, especially if you are planning a trip there. In fact, if you are planning a trip there, this book is mandatory reading. It will pump you up for your visit like no tour guide can do. It doesn't contain a lot of in-depth advice for tourists or a careful history of Barcelona's rich architectural history (Hughes has another book for that, although I have not read it). What it does is whet your appetite.Read this book and get excited about one of the most amazing cities in Europe! This is travel writing at its best and most engaging."
4,"An Abridged Version of ""Barcelona""","Which is not a bad thing, since the original 574-page version, written in 1992 just after the Barcelona Olympics, is too verbose. This version appears to have benefited from aggressive editing, deleting much of the generally irrelevant material on Barcelona's history and Catalan literature and art, which may generously be described as undistinguished.Hughes' real strength lies in architectural criticism, and here he shines. Readers who share that interest may well want to buy the 1992 version which discusses that topic in depth.Neither book, unfortunately, has a sufficient number of pictures.There is an excellent VHS tape of Barcelona [ASIN: 6303209777] that combines both ground and aerial footage. Well worth purchasing."
3,A social and art history of Barcelona,"This book will give you a sense of the Catalan spirit and personality. The author's professional interest in art focuses the book more heavily in that direction, but it is not overladen with details. It will give you a sense of the atmospherics of Barcelona and some insight into who the Catalans are. Robert Hughes doesn't just travel to Barcelona; for at least 30 years it has been his second home and he has important friendships there. He has effectively adopted the city, and this book tells us why. I enjoyed the book; I learned more about Catalunya and the spirit of its people without being overburdened by too much historical detail. The author has a dry sense of humor that some might interpret as veering into arrogance; at this point he is a semi-cantankerous old man. But his joy in revealing his love for his adopted city is apparent."
2,Having your ear chewed by an old uncle with his faded album,"I've recommended Hughes' The Fatal Shore to countless friends and also enjoyed his book on fishing, and so bought Barcelona to read on a trans-Pacific flight. What a disappointment!While superficially about a Catalan city, it is a totally self-absorbed exercise in navel gazing: `all Hughes all the time.' Do I really need to know how many dishes of pasta each of his stepsons ate at his 3rd wedding? Not really.This is a hugely and annoyingly self-indulgent book. I bought it to read about Barcelona, but the first few chapters were about Mr Hughes navel in three dimensions. I could not continue and deleted the file from my iPad.One of the hazards of professional writing is coming to believe that readers are interested in you. No, Mr Hughes, I want to read about Barcelona and not about your immodest self."
5,Perfect!,Wish I had this kind of books for every city I plan to visit.It makes you fall in love with Barcelona at first sight. Actually even before you see it in your own eyes
5,Rare IP book with C code,"Hi:This is one of the rare books on image processing that delights the reader with REAL computer language code: C. I classify it as a MUST HAVE. The author presents the basics on image processing algorithms: frequency domain - FFT, discrete cosine; spatial domain - filters, enhancement, edge detection; image compression and image segmentation. You find a combination of formulas, techniques background and C code, directly related to the formulas.The C code resembles Fortran programmers, with the use of uppercase (N1, N2, MM, etc.), one character variables (N, M), but it's no sin. You can fix it!This is one of my favored book on DIP. If you buy this book, you will not repent. By far, a good buy."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This was a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was more of a reality video and didn't have useful information. In my opinion, it's a video that was put out there to make an easy dollar."
4,Very detailed and informative-no pictures,"I have found this book indispensable since moving from the west coast to Iowa. My only criticism is that there are no pictures, just sketches, which makes it difficult to put together what you have read with what you have seen. I recently bought a small hand size plant encyclopedia to accompany it and I find it makes things much easier. It is a good read and works well for quick reference, too."
5,Getting ready for spring!,"I loved the Duggan book and now use it to plan for spring plantings. I turned an ugly yard into a beautiful garden and haven for my family and friends using the helpful, down-to-earth advice contained in the book. Whenever I think about gardening, I always check Laara's book first to find her advice about planting in shade,or in full sun, for color choices or for hardiness. I take her book with me everywhere in a plastic bag so thatI have it while on plant shopping trips, out to the nursery and out to the garden. I bought copies for my friends, too."
1,I didn't like it.,"No color pictures, it has black/white ""drawn"" pictures, but the information about each plant has a lot of detail."
2,Bad Christmas,"I'm very disappointed in the book I received. I purchased this book for my best friend for Christmas because she had just moved into her dream home that she designed and built and wanted to give her a gift that would keep on giving. When I opened the book, it was torn in many places but there wasn't enough time before Christmas to reorder or return the book."
3,Rapid Healing Foods--a bit outdated,"Chapter after chapter, the 'cure' for any ill is a cleansing diet with identical meals over a period of a week to a month with old-fashioned ways of preparing them (understandably, since this book was written over 30 years ago). It boasts of examples (unfounded) of extreme cases of a near-death condition & the person's last hope was liquid cleansing to which there was a miraculous cure that lasted for years. Some of this information is usable, the diets are extreme, but overall, makes sense as it explains which foods nutrients help certain conditions. If you can get past the grandstanding, you'll find this an interesting read."
1,Mountain Survivor's Guide,"The first word I said when I finished this book in one day since its only 126 pages was ""finally."" This was probabally the worst book anyone could ever read. Trust me, if your looking for a good read dont even look at this book. I know I might be harsh but, this book, quite frankly, Stinks. No facts, just a test that you would rather skip, then get an E, which I give this book, with an A+ being the best and and E, being the worst."
3,amusing,"the gore is cheesy although I did look away a couple of times. the character of Ruka was fun. Reminded me of Robocop, with silly TV ads, futuristic setting, and violence"
3,A little too ADD,"This movie is about a girl who kills people called 'engineers.' Engineers are people who grow weapons back where body parts get cut off. She's out to find the person who's responsible for killing her father who is in fact the father of the head engineer. Yeah, it's odd.Overall this movie was entertaining, although I wanted it to hurry up by the one hour mark. There is insane amounts of blood and guts and most of it is hilarious. There was a little too much CGI for my tastes though. I'll take bad puppets over bad computer graphics any day.Without spoiling too much, the best part is the fact that if you're studying serial killers and you get pissed off, just inject Charles Manson and Ed Gein into yourself and you'll become a super weapon weapon yourself.Rent it if you want to see it but I can't recommend buying this at full price, it's not worth multiple viewings"
2,Eihi Shiina is sexy and cool,"This movie is often laugh out loud absurd. The first half actually isn't too bad and by the end you're more than ready for it to be finished.If you're a fan of Eihi Shiina you may enjoy it just to watch her strut around with a katana and be pretty flippin' cool. As I said in the title she manages to be both sexy and stylish even in this ridiculous affair.I would love to see Quentin Tarantino take Eihi Shiina and the basic character from the beginning of this movie and do something with it. Eihi Shiina could definitely be an action/gore queen with the right vehicle.The movie does have a few cool scenes and some interesting composition at times.Again, I didn't hate it and I wouldn't recommend it to non Eihi Shiina fans."
1,Awful. Awful. Awful.,"I don't like leaving one star reviews. I always try to focus on the positives. The only positive was the star of the movie was hot. Hot woman in a mini-skirt with a samurai sword - PRO! I love japanese movies, I love samurai movies, I love scary movies, I love gory movies and this ticked all the right boxes when I was looking for a movie to buy. This was a low budget movie. It was gore for gore sake. I don't mind gore. Check out gantz, really gory, but awesome movie. This was pointless gore. The story got really silly. It was just a case of what weird and twisted things can we do? I knew the movie would be like this from the reviews, but I expected plot and awesome action. The fight scenes were rubbish. There is nothing good to say about the movie, the star was hot! I think there are much better movies out there to spend your money on."
2,Meh...,"Just an all around weird movie. I rented this and sort of had buyers remorse a few minutes in. Just a lot of strange sexual imagery and blood sprays. Story seemed a little lackluster. It actually seemed like it would've been better as a manga or even a animated film, because it was so over-the-top. All-in-all, I could live with it if it was just the effects/prop shortcomings, but to me, the story left much to be desired."
3,could have been 30 minutes shorter.,"I've been a fan of Tokyo shock for a long time, but this was a failed execution of what could have been a damn good movie. Scenes took way to long to play out, and the ""story"" took forever to move along.With that being said, the action and gore scenes were pretty good. Nothing to nuts for a Tokyo shock film, but I think at a certain point it just gets dumb. Which happened a few times during the movie. But hey, you watch shock for that reason don't you? As I've said, if the scenes were edited down a bit for time, I am sure it would have been a damn fine movie and a lot of fun. But it just kept dragging on and on. Here's to hoping their next flick has editors who know how to make a film progress quicker."
2,didnt live up to the hype,for being a new movie it feels really dated!i would recommend machine girl or meatball machine if your looking for a good Japanese splatter film
2,No thanks...,I love violent movies but apparently this was created for people with some kind of fetish for gore. If thats your thing then you might enjoy this but the average person seeking a badass action movie should look elsewhere.
2,Warped Japanese entertainment at it's finest,"Some movies are in black and white, some are in color, but this movie was practically 98% RED! Even in the seventies, some of that Japanese bloodbath cinema was pretty over-the-top and intense. Those writers over there in Japan: do they have personal problems? Does sick people in death-row prisons write this stuff? This world is getting pretty scary if this is what entertains people."
1,DONT BUY THIS,Let someone you dont like rent this first. This was just about one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. it became less about watching the movie for enjoyment and more about making mysekf sit through it out of principal that i actully PAID for this trash. I dont know how this got soo many good reviews. It doesnt deserve them. I think its all a big prank put together by a bunch of friends to convince poor suckers like me to actully buy the movie and then be blind sided by just how bad this movie is. Good job guys it worked! I had no idea it would be this bad.... Please dont buy this.
2,check what your buying,This has a really bad type set for a proper e book.I would recommend the jeeves collection instead for the same price.
5,Amusing and Cohesive,"This most excellent tome chronicles some of Wooster's most memorable exploits and keeps the story of Bingo moving along nicely. Pity it's ""limited availability"" may restrict people from getting their hands on it."
1,no navigation or TOC makes this ebook next to useless,to go to a specific story you need to page through the whole book. not even a table of comtents. get another jeeves collction.
2,good translator,1.The language the translator uses when talking about the prophets is disrespectful.2.The translator's own poems are rubbish.3.He is a good translator.Ibn Arabi's poems are full of desire and love.
3,Good but not what I was expecting...,"I was a little surprised that the one chapter on Advanced DHTML techniques could have been titled: ""Intro to JavaScript."" I was disappointed because there was little on advanced CSS layout (1 chapter) with examples that were difficult to follow.If you want a book teaching JavaScript and PHP integration this book is for you. If you want a book on advanced CSS techniques that you might want to look elsewhere."
5,Great book! I still use the previous one for reference too,"I thought i'd never need to refer to a DHTML/CSS book again (I thought the first DHTML and CSS Visual QuickStart book had covered it all) but a friend left this book on my desk and I couldn't bring myself to give it back.Like the first book, this is not a 'repetitive review of the features' book, I'd call it a 'lets see what DHTML and CSS can do for us now' book. It both describes and illustrates the concepts and has nuggets of practical information that a hands-on person would immediately take to.From overlooked but relevant optimal meta tag usage details like link relationships to accessing XML and using php with MySQL. You know the writer thought about what readers would need informationon. I highly recommend this book, with or without the first book."
2,Proves the military has some unusual aircraft . . .,"There is nothing to support the actor's opinion that this is alien technology from another world or us from the future. In fact, very few actual witnesses are interviewed, the death metal sound track is sickening and the wreckage looks man made. The pieces of the ""craft"" look like something the army would make a lightweight drone out of. After viewing this I'm absolutely certain that the craft is of current earthly origin. Nothing was proved otherwise. Poorly filmed, below average in just about every way. Can't recommend it.It is my personal belief that any advanced alien craft capable of making the journey from hundreds of light years away (including navigating black holes) don't crash when they get to gentle benign earth."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this large caulk gun to replace a home depot large caulk gun that failed. This model has the right design but they used cheap die cast parts in assembly and that is where the failure occurred. This caulk gun sold by American Marketing Inc, however it is made in China. Off to Berlands Tools to get a real caulk gun."
4,Babies are boys?,"I prefer the The Breastfeeding Book : Everything You Need to Know About Nursing Your Child from Birth Through Weaning by Martha and William Sears. It's a more readable book in many ways, and there was one small thing that bothered me about the La Leche League book which made it impossible to use. The authors use ""he"" in referring to the baby. They say that there is no sexist intent in using the ""he,"" but it just felt uncomfortable to me. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, then it seems to be almost as good as the Sears' book which I find to be perfect."
3,Comprehensive BUT...,"This book does contain alot of information for the woman who wants to breastfeed such as I do. However, the thing that bothered me is that it is very one sided. La Leche League seems to push their views as the ONLY way to do things and the ONLY way to be. There is definitely helpful info here if you can weed out their opinions and use your own good judgement. I stopped reading this halfway when a friend recommended The Nursing Mother's Companion by Kathleen Huggins. That one is a must have."
4,homer the hunter,"homer, notoriously inept with a shotgun, cannot believe his good fortune when he snags Rabbit with just one shot. cute little tale of ghostly guests."
3,Interesting Yiddish literature but..,"Sholem Aleichem's collected stories titled ""Teyve's Daughters"" has a few interesting things to say about Jews and their lives, but it reads a bit awkwardly, and well..Teyve is only in about a third of the stories. The rest is totally unrelated to Teyve and his seven daughters. The Teyve chapters are among the best, with the dairyman helping his daughters in spite of his notions of being rich. He loves his daughters, and becomes estranged from one of his daughters, Chava, for marrying a gentle."
3,good album,"Yes, almost everybody was expecting next death'n'roll album. But this one is more ""roll"" than ""death"".. that's all! For more ""death"" look earlier or later ;)"
1,Are you SURE this is Entombed?,"...unfortunately yes it is. This CD is by far their worst. Pick up ""To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth"" or ""Wolverine Blues""(AWESOME) or the self-titled blue Entombed collection. This CD really ... guys!"
1,Run dont walk............,"Yes folks, run dont walk away from this Cd. How for the love of God, does the record company allow them to keep the name Entombed???? This Cd is junk. But...all the fans out there can atleast have Wolverine Blues, Left Hand Path and Clandestine. Those are True Entombed albums...and all classics. Get those instead if you want the real thing. What a damn shame."
2,Dull,"The ""other"" Mac books seem to have a sense humor. This is dull as dirt-couldn't find what I was looking for either."
1,Not of much use for technical people.,It's neither useful for developers or architects or managers. Most of the pages are filled with screenshots/images(WebSphere portal administration interfaces).I found better information in the IBM Redbooks on WebSphere Portal Server.
3,Average Natural Soap,"Comfrey w/Aloe 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap is an average soap. It does contain natural ingredients like it says. Two negative things about this soap is the shape and the residue. The square shape of the soap kinda makes it difficult to use when bathing, and the soap leaves a greenish-colored residue on the surface it's on after it has been used. Also, although it is natural, females should be careful when using this soap because it may be too strong for feminine hygiene use."
2,too light,these are pretty much the standard foosball ball but are too light. Also don't seem to have that much control on the ball. Also the ball seems to jump on the table a lot and make a lot of noise..
1,Not too sturdy.,"These may be labelled ""Tournament Foosballs"" but I can't imagine them surviving a tournament; they picked up visible dents after just a game or two, and we weren't hitting them especially hard. They're also noticeably lighter than the urethane foosballs we'd been playing with."
3,"Interesting, but not convincing.","A comment on 'information', which is probably one of the points most to be criticised with this book:First of all, Spetner ought to have defined, quantitatively, what he means by 'genomic information' (otherwise, how does he know that it is greater in 'more highly evolved' species ?)A random event, in itself, will presumably not increase information. But random mutations, _filtered through the non-random processes of natural selection_, will.More biological data is needed to determine whether, given evolutionary timescales, the development of life as we can see it was likely.The above points mean that I cannot concur with Spetner in his criticism of Neo-Darwinism. Of course Darwinism cannot be proven to be true, and it may not necessarily be correct (this is true of _all_ scientific theories), but it is the best explanation for life we have so far."
5,Good book from an Evolutionist,"Dr. Spetner has done a masterful job in this little book. He makes a number of points against the Darwinian theory of evolution, but beware, Dr. Spetner is himself an evolutionist. And what better kind of book to use when debating other evolutionists than a book by an evolutionist which puts many arguments to rest. He shows very clearly and mathmatically how ""random variations cannot lead to the large scale evolution claimed by the neo-Darwinians."" However, he tries to persuade us into seeing his theory of NREH, or Nonrandom Evolutionary Hypothesis. Aside from this new theory which he offers, he absolutely smashes the neo-Darwinists hopes of ever producing coherent arguments based upon scientific evidence for Darwinism of any kind. An excellent book for the Christian apologetist debating neo-Darwinists."
5,A wonderful array of data for other mechanisms in evolution.,"This book follows in a long line of other books which presents challenges to neo-Darwinism as a complete theory of evolution. Although epigenetic (nonrandom induced mutations) inheritance seems to occur, why aren't these facts getting out there into mainstream science (outside of microbiology at least)? Spetner presents the evidence in a clear and concise manner, supplemented with a primer in genetics in the Appendix. Books like this, as well as Jablonka and Lamb's ""Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution"" are often maligned or ignored by the mainstream. Why are so many so hostile to other mechanisms at work in evolution? Is science still a quest for the truth or merely the upholding of accepted orthodoxy?"
2,"Interesting, but it misses the mark.",Natural selection is not a purely stochastic process. The computations reported in this book assume that it is.
1,Beware!,I find it horrifying that the techniques of pseudoscience can be used so slickly that even educated readers may think it is sound. It is easy to support any view when your data is cherry-picked or outright untrue (e.g. that all observed mutations lose information content).
4,"Not well written, but packs a punch","Not an especially well written book; it's painfully repetitive in places. The explanations and examples are not always very clear. The introduction seems to promise to look at evolution in light of modern information theory, but the book never really defines or describes information theory.Despite its faults, the main point seems inescapable: theories of evolution based on random variation can't hold up under close scrutiny. If you're a naturalist taking refuge from intelligent design in evolutionary theory, you have three choices: 1) Insist that evolution is some how above or immune to the natural laws of mathematics and probability (i.e. evolution is ""super-natural""). 2) Abandon your self delusion. 3) Press the back button now. Don't read this book. Place your hands over your ears and repeat loudly, ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU""."
4,no agendas please,"It is apparent that evolution is a very passionate topic for many people, however personal agendas should be restrained during reviews. Erica Peters' review above points out in one sentence that ""If the readers of this book are really trying to get to something resembling the ""truth,"" then the readers of this book should be willing read all sides of the argument. Then proceeds to say in her next breath, ""understand that this book too is unheplful. It will take you further down the path of scientific illiteracy, which is what these authors are preying on"". Aren't intelligent people supposed to examine all angles of an issue and come to specific conclusions based on personal assimilation and reflection of data? To suggest that an author maintaining a differing point of view than your own, desires to prey upon those possessing ""scientific illiteracy"" is not only grossly distorted, but unjustified. Erica, how do you know what the authors intentions are? Lighten up!"
3,"Random Bad, Group-Selectionism Also Bad","True, I have only made it to page 46, but page 15 contains a photo of a Grizzly Bear, with the syrupy-politically-correct caption ""Predator animals do not overexploit prey populations..."" To me, this ""Group Selectionism"" is like waving a red cape in front of a Bull, yes, I'm a Taurus. To focus on ""what gets replicated"" seems simple, but Dawkins gets some amazing mileage out of that paradigm !In my 3rd-edition copy of ""The Selfish Gene"", it's on page 7 that Dawkins summarizes ""...the misconception that I have already mentioned, that living creatures evolve to do things 'for the good of the species, or 'for the good of the group'."" When you're done with Dawkins, you might pick up Garrett Hardin's ""Filters Against Folly"" for some ranting against Tragedies-of-the-Managed-Commons. Using Arthur Koestler's term SPCDH, group-selectionism is a dead horse which needs much more kicking.Darwinism is muddy thinking, but so is Commonism !"
1,Jewish Science,"The author, Spetner, does not hide that he is a Jew who cannot face the truth of evolution and its racial consequences. He may come to other conclusions by reading first books which I recommend instead: Why Race matters (by Michael Levin); Duke's My Awakening; The Descent of Man (by Darwin); The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor); and the books by Richard Dawkins on evolution. None of the authors of these books is afraid of evolution and its consequences, their books contain true, honest science."
3,Darwin takes another hit...,"The science is somewhat dificult in this book, but if you stay with the arguments presented, a logical case against Darwinism emerges as the book progresses. This is not light reading, but if you have an interest in ideas beyond the status quo, you will be rewarded."
1,Don't buy it,Do not buy books from this publisher. They publish books that are still in copyright as material out of copyright. This is only one example of many.
5,Great product for anyone with a walker,Great product. Very well made. Snaped right into place without tools. It allows much greater ability to be self sufficient and lowers the risk of a fall.
5,Hiding and Seeking,"To understand Thomas' poetry we must first understand his theology. Phillips comes closer than most to succeeding in this task, as he points to the central importance for Thomas of waiting for God. God is, for Thomas, Deus absconditus - we see and know nothing of God except what God chooses to reveal in brief glimpses. This book was published in 1986, so is a bit dated; and, of course, has been overtaken to some extent by Thomas' last works. However,it remains a valuable contribution to the growing literature on the work of this great poet."
2,"Better than the factory plastic rod, but not good for much else","I bought this hoping for a real nice rod, not so much.My wife's 92 Centurion has a factory metal guide rod, and it feels lighter in the way of recoil. I side-by-side compared this with a bone-stock 92FS, my wife's Centurion, and then my modded 92FS, it was not any different or better.I shot 115 grain and 124 grain 9mm loads out of this, neither had a felt difference when compared to my other test guns.Unless you really hate the plastic guide rod, save your money."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"As others have already said, this part can be a real pain to install when field stripping the pistol. When I installed the part, I had high hopes but the fit was not as exact as it could have been. The recoil spring warped a bit, and when firing the weapon the second or third round would jam in the extractor. It was easily cleared, but it made me nervous because it would be awkward to have something like this happen during a critical situation. I've since replaced this buffer with a Fire Dragon dual-action spring; a bit more expensive, but much better quality and so far it seems to work perfectly."
1,cheap!,Bushing mushrooms after 100 rounds! If they made the bushing out of a more forgiving material it would be worth buying. But with only 100 rds. the bushing mushrooms and rubs the spring. Feeding Beretta 96 with 180gn. Federal fmj.
2,Can't really tell much difference!,"I cannot tell much, if any difference in the felt recoil since installing this buffer. What I mean to say is, if the difference was supposed to be drammatic, it was not. The instructions for installing it are useless. It's a good thing I am menchanically inclined or I would have never figured out how to install it. In all fairness, it may be that I'll have to cycle more than 50 rounds to start feeling a difference in felt recoil, but as I stated before, presently there doesn't seem to be any improvement."
5,Boffo Buffer,I received my recoil buffer and installed it on my Inox 92fs. Looks and operates as good as I had hoped. Very nice quality that is worth the price.
4,Giant Plastic Werewolf,"I like this toy. It's a giant plastic werewolf. The model is really wonderful looking and of typical plastic molded action figure quality. Fear Fang has a hinged jaw that allows for a small range of emotion to be expressed (anywhere from angry to furious). It comes with a thigh bone club that I suppose the can hit other toys with (his ""bone Smash Attach"" advertised on the box). My only real complaint with this toy is the free card that comes in the package. I got ""Bloody Squito"", which really has nothing to do with my raging ball of plastic fur. All around a great toy, durable, fun and big!"
4,Interesting read,It's been a while since I received this book. I enjoy a variety of reads and am always looking for something different and interesting.
5,A flat out amazing book.....,"This book tells stories that are as fun to read as a James Bond movie is to watch.... and apparently, no one realized this. Setting aside that it is a book of serious history, it tells the stories of the OSS and the NVKD and MI-6 and the German Abwehr. It tells of the decptions of Canaris... which are a key to understanding the whole of the progress of the war.First, I can't believe that this book is so soon out of print. Second, if you are interested in WWII and haven't read this title, you must go out and get it!"
4,Great item!!!!,"I have an older version of this monopod (from about 2000) and I love it. It is easier to carry around than a tripod, and when you need the extra stability you can always unscrew the base and let out the ""feet"". Just make sure you never let the monopod free stand or you may find yourself looking to purchase a new camera\lens. And for those of us who have found ourselves in some less than ideal environments with expensive camera equipment, the monopod makes an excellent ""deterrent"" or club. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the base can become difficult to screw\unscrew if it is used in an extremely sandy area, such as at the beach. I had to then take the garden hose and thouroughly rinse the base and feet of mine of for several minutes, dry them with a rag, then apply a light coating of grease to the threads. A minor inconvience."
3,a little dissapointed,I bought this spine trying to save a little money and hoping it would be a good quality. I was dissapointed when it arrived. I was even more dissapointed after I was able to compare this product to others that I could have bought instead if I was willing to pay just a litte more.
3,Groundhog Day meets Left Behind,"This one started out with promised but fizzled into a senseless story of repeating the same day over and over again so that one man doesn't miss the rapture. Will this work that way for the five foolish virgins too? Beautiful scenery and cinematography and decent acting do not overcome the weak story. Without David A.R. White to carry this movie, it would have been even worse. I loved Groundhog Day the first time. Making a copycat film just doesn't cut it in my book."
5,WOW,"If there was ever a movie to make you think back on your life and change, this is definately it."
5,Great movie.,This movie is a christian version of Groundhog Day. David A.R. White is terrific as a police officer who lives the day his wife disappears over and over until he comes to great revelation.
2,WASTE OF TIME & MONEY.,"THERE IS ""NO DO OVERS IN THE RAPTURE. You've got one time to get it right with God and Jesus and that's it. I had to fast forward 4 times in this movies to get pass the repeated days,..to get to the final ending of the movie.The Rapture came and it was 'do over days' on the yatch for 3 people. And the same day kept repeating itself in the Rapture.This could have been a good movie but someone monkeyed with the true plot and destroyed the movie. I got so sick of it I kept FF.I did'nt enjoy it I got tired of it. No happy I had to pay for it but I'm glad Ijust paid 2.99 and did not buy the movie. I really would have been angry.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. DISAPPOINTING. Destroying of a good christian movieand bible story."
2,Not truly horrible but nothing impressive,"This was nothing like ""Groundhog Day"" except that the day was repeated several times.There was little humor and no clever lines.The acting was only good by this genre's standards, but quite poor by any other.The dialog was wooden and stilted.There were MAJOR plot holes and several ""huh"" moments for things that just didn't make sense.The characters were mostly unchanging except for the final ""eureka"" moment.There was no conclusion of the movie - it just sort of ends, and that's it.Like I said, other than the repeating day idea, the movie has nothing that might make it appeal to someone who liked Groundhog Day.Within the genre, it's of normal quality, but by every other standard it's pretty poor. If one looks at it for some sort of theology, I've never heard of anyone suggest anything like the ""theology"" presented in the movie.The best I can say for it is that it didn't stink."
4,Good Movie for Small Groups but lacking key element if viewing alone.,"I liked the movie. Thought the acting was good. Thought the plot was interesting. Thought the content a little empty in terms of theology. It hints at the solution to the puzzle, but not in such a way a viewer will exactly know what the solution was in exact terms. Would be good for a showing before a Christian group where that solution could then be explored a bit further through discussion."
2,A film that never goes anywhere?,"The acting in this movie was good. The problem with the movie is....well the movie itself. Eric Roberts is featured prominently on the cover, yet his total on screen time is maybe 3 or 4 minutes. The story is about the rapture and the events of what happens to the main character afterwards. He relives the same day over and over again (think Groundhog Day), and finally accepts Jesus Christ and is ""taken"" with his friends. I find this irresponsible, because we do not get ""do-overs"" in life. If you make the wrong choice regarding your salvation, then it is game over with the coming of the rapture. You will be ""Left Behind"". there is also another plot in this movie of a singer who is kidnapped, and then by implcation, it is found to maybe be her boyfriend. This story line never goes anywhere, and is only a further hinderance to the main plot of the movie. If you are looking for a movie with a message, then I would steer clear from this one."
1,The rapture and salvation with no mention of Jesus??,How does a movie about the rapture and salvation NOT mention Jesus?? Well a classic dud movie. Do not waste your time or money if you are a Christian it may grieve your righteous soul. Any non believer watching this movie will come away more confused than before. it leaves a lot of questions and no answers because Jesus the answer is not mentioned AT ALL. I would highly NOT recommend this film.
1,Embarassing!,"I am embarrassed that I paid good money for this cheesy, lousy movie. The acting stinks. The plot is ridiculous. The film is preachy and phony and fails to do anything more than provoke it's viewers to become exasperated with the corny lines and wooden acting. It's repetitive and furthermore, the theology is all wrong. No one knows the hour or the day of Jesus's return. Not even the Son, but only the Father. The movie gives the cop chance after chance to get saved so that in the end he is able to predict exactly when the rapture will occur. He even sets the timer on his watch. UGH! Unfortunately I showed this movie to a group at my home without previewing it first. They suffered through it politely but I doubt any of them want to see a Christian movie again. :-("
5,"Dear Lord, Great God, Oh Jesus!!!","This movie was a total waste of time. I suppose that anyone who ""did't get the message"", is doomed to go through the experience that the protagonist had to endure. Or that's what those who ""Got the message"" are sure of. It's so simple. This movie is for simpletons of nothing except ""faith"". Oh, I'm converted alright. Right away from TBN. Following the movie was an androgynous ""DINO"" playing a grand Baldwin, fountains bursting, a ghostly choir, Glory Hallelujah! The wax in my ears is melting. IT'S A MIRACLE!!!!!!This sort of ""Christianity"" is an abomination in itself. Lord have mercy on those who create this drivel that lobotomizes the viewer.I've said my peace. Go ahead and crucify me too. I'm ready. I can't take it anymore. I'm outa here."
4,Great Condition,"For a used copy I wasn't sure what to expect but the book came quick and just in time for my first semester back in school! The information is timely and can be applied to my work in the field. I am excited to read more of the articles as I examine ways to be a better youth worker. If you are looking for a resource that will give you better ways to think about youth engagement and the idea of 'community', this is the book for you."
2,Tricky on date of publication,"I selected a more recent version of publication of the book, but when my book arrived, it is a very old version (1969 sixth printing). I was disappointed as apparently the book did not match with the description of the one I selected and paid for. I remember I chose the one printed in the 80's but 60's! Meaningfulness of the explanations on eschatology really count on the date of publication.I know the most recent version is of 2010 e-version that can be downloaded online. I think I have been cheated in this purchase by the seller."
4,"Good, not Great","While some of the films are first-rate, jamming four film on one side of a DVD sometimes compromises their clarity, especially on big-screen TVs. I also wish that WAXWORKS was the Unrated edition, like SLAUGHTER HIGH and CLASS OF 1999 are on this set."
1,Not that origional of a theme,"I bought the book and was looking forward to reading it. I am a fan of Scotish fiction and was interested in the theme of this book. This to me was a play on Gabaldon's books. I feel the other review was a bit stilted and one sided. If the writer talks to M.E. Grant again, tell him that 1 book was enough or find a theme for a book that is origional."
4,Great Book!,Really enjoyed this literary trip back in time as I was captivated by the details setting up the book's theme. Hopefully the author will continue to amaze us with his acute attention to detail if and when he releases a sequel!
4,Great Escapism,"I do not know what book the reader from North Dakota was reading, but it could not have been the Blood of Scotland. It is great escapism in the truest sense of the word. It is ludicrous to compare this book to another book. It is like complaining that Shrek did not get the Oscar! I highly recommend this book and hope Hollywood discovers it! Matt Ferguson, Dupont, Washington"
3,Blood of Scotland,"Dear Reader, I am a great fan of Gabaldon myself so unlike the reader in North Dakota, I see no similarities between the Grant book to the Diana Gabaldon series other than the setting is based in Scotland. I am not sure how different the theme could be from the Gabaldon books. You are free to contact my friend, Mark Grant if you want @ Aigan@aol.com"
3,Love the idea...,"Faeries, and Vampires in one book, sounds too good to be true. :-)Ok the book is good but at one points it gets a bit boring and the relationship between Spike and Buffy is very off track. The last conversation they have in this book was so stupid, it was like two different people talking, not B/S. As always Spike is willing to lay down his own life for Buffy (but it wasn't written quite as passionately) and all Buffy does is say ""Whatever"" and walks away... I'f you expect a fluffy love story here, don't buy this book."
1,Will the real Spike please stand up?,"Whoa, what is this? I read this book hoping to gain some insight into one of the best characters I've encountered on popular television. The redemption arc of Spike: the big, bad master vamp turned anti-hero, has been a very compelling story. It seems to have been sacrificed here for some unknown reason...perhaps to further the heroine? I really don't understand the writer's choice here. I cannot express how disappointed I am by the character assassination in 'Blood and Fog.' I guarantee I won't be buying anymore until I'm shown the Spike I've come to love. Or, at the very least, a Spike that is consistent with what's been portrayed on the show. This book just left me scratching my head."
5,A good read,"Well its nice to finally have a book thats somewhat up to date with the series and has Buffy and Spike on the cover and not the ancient Buffy and Angel duo. Spike's characterization is one-note and out of date with his characterization in seasons 5-7 of the show, but Spike fans have to take what they can get I suppose."
4,Times Change and so does everyone....including vampires.,"Blood and Fog visits the present and past to bring forth a retelling of Jack the Ripper that involves a Slayer from the past and present day Buffy. The only constant in the story is Spike....he's been in this Fog before. This book kept me interested because I liked the story, not because I expected the book to conform exactly to the TV show. Buffy and Spike have a complex relationship that is well represented in this book. I was pleased to see Willow and Tara, as well as something about Watchers. The ending is worth the read."
4,Good Fan novel,"Some parts of the book annoyed me. For instance, the part that in 1888 Spike is described as being a bleached blonde... but I'm finicky. Some of the premise of this book gleefully - almost disrespectfully - ignores season 6 canon, particularly the story arc of Willow's addiction to magic. A few scenes are really in the style of the show and you can almost hear the characters saying the dialogue, but mostly this is a novel set in Buffyland, not a novel of the Buffyverse."
4,An interesting Buffy book.,"Blood and Fog by Nancy holder is a good Buffy read. But it is often incorrect.Spike's hair wasn't white yet at the time of Jack of the ripper in 1888. And as far as I know Angel never killed a slayer and avoided them.The parts in Sunnydale were good. Nancy Holder had most of the character's personalities down. Dawn, Buffy, and Spike were shown well. Even though I am pretty sure at points in the story she got the slang wrong. Buffy wasn't really saying ""wigged"" or ""wig"" that much anymore and I think Spike used some English slang incorrectly at one point.Other then that the story is good and interesting. I loved the flash backs in time, though I wished the story had taken more time in Sunnydale."
4,Some people are reviewing the book with out reading it.,"If your a fan of Buffy and Spike there are some real good thing for you in this book. The interaction takes place in the middle of season and their is B/S on more then one occasion. I have noticed some Spike fans are reviewing the book before reading it and that is a mistake. It is important that anyone that wants future Spike or B/S books buy this novel. However, I do agree that there was some pretty big mistakes in terms of how Spike's evilness was portayed in season 6 of the series. Yet, this book has some quite good B/S interaction and Spike and Dawn interaction. There are many reasons why a Spike fan or a B/S fan would want to buy this book. I urge all fans of Spike and B/S to buy this book, not doing so is just shooting your self in the foot."
1,More Spike bashing nonsense!,"If you're a Spike fan, don't bother wasting your money on this book. Just like many of the other BTVS books on the market, this one portrays Spike as a stupid, one-dimensional villain. In other words, the characterization is terrible!Anyone who actually watches the show knows that Spike is anything *but* a flat character. He has a multitude of layers, something the author of this book doesn't even begin to recognize. Between the poor characterization and the constant ""Spike bashing"" by the Scooby Gang, the book left me more irritated than entertained. So unless you despise Spike, steer clear of this book (as well as any book by Chris Golden). It's not worth your money or your time.Instead, try ""These Our Actors"" or possibly ""Little Things"". Those two novels have much better characterization and are more Spike-friendly."
1,Enjoyable,"The story was interesting, escapist fiction. It was a treat to read a book with Spike as a main force. Less depressing than Spark and Burn. I couldn't put it down. I should have put 5 stars. For some reason, when I edit my reviews the stars change."
5,"Spike fighting with the good guys, that's new in books !","I'm also a Spuffy fan, and of course I don't like seeing (or reading) spike bashing, but it has good parts in it and Spike and Buffy interact and not as ennemies. Some Dawn / Spike interaction too. Spuffies, go, buy it if you want to read more ""good Spike"" in books in the future..."
5,I like spike!,"This book is not the awful drek that some have painted it. Spike's behaveior is very consistent with season 6, as is Buffy's behavior. Their relationship is a tangled mess at this time and this book shows it. Spike loves Buffy, Buffy is attracted to Spike but hates herself for it. Spike does just as he did in the show, he helps her despite her attitude towards him and she lets him help her. The one big thing that would show this is at the end of the book and to write about it would spoil the ending for those who haven't read it. I enjoyed reading this book a lot."
4,Lovely lovely,"In this book, a seven year old boy tells different stories about his life and troubles. Though the book suffers from ending a bit abruptly, the stories are pleasant reading. This book contains a loving family that is both realistic and great reading. I especially enjoyed the suburban setting. I thought the first person narrative worked especially well too. The book reminded me a little of other ""boys growing up"" tales, like the ""Soup"" books or even Tom Sawyer. Two thumbs up."
3,Catalog Cats,"I didn't like this book because it doesn't have good stories. I reccomend this book to someone who likes girl books. I did not like the stories in the book because they were confusing to me. I was confused on the pudding story because they said, ""You ate some, so I have to eat some, I ate some,"" over and over again. That's all I have to write."
1,I'm just glad they nixed the old cover art,"I'm just glad they nixed the old cover art, which depicted rather extremely exaggerated caricatures reminiscent of the old minstrel man, Little Black Sambo routine. And the issue date of that cover was 1981, a bit late to still be clinging to such imagery, I thought.Coupled with the analogies and veiled references to beating and whipping, replete with the protagonists actually crying and cowering underneath their beds in abject terror, but actually meaning it as it relates to the culinary arts could be a bit off-putting to the 5-8 year old crowd, I should think."
5,The Stories Julian Tells,The Stories Julian Tells is a book that has six stories. You should read all the stories! One of the stories is about a father that makes a pudding!
3,Nostalgic value only,"I thought I remembered the Bobbsey Twins books with great delight, but of course I was a very young child when I read them. There was not enough here to keep my attention, but by all means, get them if you have a nostalgic ache for things that cheered you when you were a tadpole."
5,Fun and engaging early reader,"My daughter is 5 and found the books in the Puffin Easy-to-Read series (level 1) to be just the right stage for her in developing her reading skills. She is able to read them with a high level of fluency and the success she experiences with these books has given her more confidence and motivated her to read more. Level 1 here is for ages 4-7 (as recommended by the publisher). There are familiar sight words appropriate for this level.The stories in this series are engaging and come with full-color illustrations which interest young readers. The story here is about two precocious kittens, Pat and Matt who enjoy playing games. Their romps around the tree make this a funny and interesting read.I highly recommend this beginning reader series!"
2,Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK 42-inch Plasma EDTV,"I bought this way before the HDTV market started to get good, so needless to say, it wasn't a good buy. The picture quality is fine, but it's a stripped down model with few connectivity options. I have to order custom cables to make most of our components compatible, and it's not TRUE High Def...but overall, it's been a fine television. I'd go with a bigger, cheaper LCD at this point if I was going to replace it, but live and learn."
4,Great TV..that needs a few extras,"Great TV. Much more affordable that HDTV and it looks pretty much the same. So much so, I bought this TV twice and may buy two more. Make sure you decide if you're going to mount it on the wall or put it on a stand and buy these accessories at the same time that you are buying this tv. You may also need some adapters BNC to RCA etc. All in All...I great buy."
2,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","A collection of papers, mainly focused on the issue of intervention in the former Yugoslavia, including useful surveys of the policy debates in France (by Jolyon Howorth) and Germany (by Harald Müller). There are three general papers on intervention in Bosnia: a mainly historical summary of Western policy failures and hesitancies by James Gow, a strongly analytical and critical paper by Jane Sharp, and a weaselly anti-intervention piece by Ken Booth, which tries hard to relativize every aspect of the conflict, rejecting the word `aggressor' and declaring that Milosevic's attack on Bosnia was motivated by `fear'."
3,Good price but minor issue,Purchased this polo at a good price and my only complain is that the area where the buttons is does not sit straight or need ironing. Even when buttoning up a section is not flat it sticks out. It's true that I could probably iron it but haven't had to do that to other polos that I have owned. Overall a good polo for the price.
3,Good for the money,So far i am pretty happy with these lights. The housings and lenses are very durable and will not break easily. They produce yellow light and did improve my visability in a heavy snow storm. The only complaint I have is with the switch they included in the kit. It is a cheapo push button. I would suggest purchasing a different switch before you install.
4,Hella fog lights installed on back rack,I purchased these lights to install on my back rack(headache rack) for my truck. I needed extra light when I plow to back up so I installed these on the rack to help me see better. The lights are bright and are well worth the money. I would recommend them if you want a bright light at a very fair price.
2,Good PDA if you dont use Excel,"All features of this PDA worked as expected except for the update of Excel spread sheet files. When the spreadsheet files are sent back to the PDA, via Pocket Sheet Sync program, cell attributes change. This problem has been verified by Casio technical support."
4,Casio Cassiopeia PV-S400Plus Pocket Viewer,"After having a Palm VII for 2 years I realized that more is not necessarily better. The Palm only had 2 megs of ram and was getting dangerously low in space. I didn't have funds to get a more expensive PDA and basically only use it for schedule and contacts. The PV-S400 had 4 megs of storage. Twice that of the Palm VII. Monochrome interface is passable, still hard to see against indoor lighting sometimes. Performance is quick though and the interface is intuitive. Warning though Casio's sync software tends to get confused if you have a modem hooked up to one of the COM ports. But there are workarounds. For less than $50 bucks, this is a smart little pda."
3,On the verge of greatness,"On a whole I loved my little Casio, but it had some flaws that really annoyed me. The PC sync only works on one computer for some unknown reason. You cannot take it to the office sync it with that pc, then sync it withyour home pc. Also, the sync option didn't work period for me. I couldn't get it to run. And the screen broke a week after I bought it.That being said, I liked to planner function and address book alot. The format is wonderful. I also liked thetouch keyboard. Since grafitee is owned by palm, the casio uses a little on screen keyboard. It can be hard at first to use, but you get used to it quickly. I am buying a palm soon though. Mostly because of the pc sync issues, and the fact that more software is out there for palm os systems."
4,Basic - But Good,"My old Sharp Zaurus was too bulky and I needed a PDA with a scheduler, a system that allows me to jot down notes, something to keep me busy when I'm stuck waiting and a phone book. I was shocked at how well this inexpensive unit does all of that. The scheduler allows you to link appointments with contacts in your phone book - double bonus. Another plus is the `quick memo' that allows you to write notes on the screen. Negative: the cradle has a serial port while many PCs have USB connections. You can buy a converter for about $...though."
2,Another battery problem,"As another reviewer also found out, I had a terrible battery life problem, running through several (expensive) AAA pairs very quickly with little use...Since I live in Mexico and bought this on a trip to NY at Compusa, I probably won't be able to get a refund...now I'm buying a Sony Clie on Amazon. My advice: stay away from this cheapo stuff. Although the PV 400 is a very decent ""lo-fi"" PDA, you're better off buying quality products!"
1,"Toy-Like Junk, No Instructions, Lame Software","I have used a Palm III and Palm VII. I wanted a [inexpensive] Palm-like organizer, so I bought this unit. THe display is dim and fuzzy. There are NO INSTRUCTIONS for installing the PC Sync software, and no troubleshooting help available. The device would not communicate with my WIndows 2000 or Win 98 PC. It comes with a serial port connector (not USB) and ""PC Sync 99"" software. The unit is light, toy-grade plastic, the touch screen is too sensitive. There is nothing about this device to recommend. Spend a few more bucks for a Palm or a Handspring."
1,Difficult to sync,"This organizer works great with Outlook! You can store all of your contacts in the organizer and take them wherever you go.***BUT***Using the Pocket Sheet Sync to send and receive Excel files is like pulling teeth. I have tried changing every setting on my computer and in the software, but this will NOT work at all for me. I am using Microsoft Excel 2000 on a Windows ME system. I can send the files from the organizer to my computer, but not the other way around. The error tells me that I need to contact technical support, but they aren't helpful with this issue at all. The only thing that they could advise was that I change the batteries. I tried that to no avail. They had no other suggestions.HORRIBLE LITTLE PRODUCT--WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME"
3,"Useful , but imcomplete","A useful text , poorly designed though ..This book alone won't do much for you .Many scale patterns are presented in tab with a standard staff .This is silly , a simple diagram would be much clearer and take up far less room on the page .Theres a place for tab , a place for staff , and a place for diagrams . The authors don't seem to appreciate this .There's a 'bonus' chapter at the end .This is just full of SOME of the stuff which was missing from the preceding chapters !"
2,I feel misled by Amazon and the reviews.,"When I bought this, I didn't see anything that indicated it was self-published. And as a devoted reader of historical fiction by the likes of Cormac McCarthy, Umberto Eco, John Fowles, etc., I found the writing in this book to be weak, amateurish, and disappointing. Shame on Amazon for not making it clear to buyers that this is a vanity publication."
2,Not History,"If you know the history, just by reading the synopsis this book is discredited as a source of History:""..Wallachia was caught between two voracious predators: the kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman empire.""It is a SUBTLE LIE, but really important. It was not the Hungarian Empire the voracious predator, but the Ottoman Empire. It was the Ottoman empire the one who wanted to conquer the heart of Europe. Years later, ottomans reached even Vienna, but fortunately they couldn't seize the city."
4,"Great read, well written",What a great book! Though it is based on real events it is of course just a possible version of what might have happened in the life of Vlad Dracula. But the story felt right and I enjoyed it very much. Nice work by the author.
1,Not worth it.,"The material is EXTREMELY cheap looking and the buttons fell off. I ended up not even wearing it, what a waste!"
5,"Pleasantly Surprised, Great Video!","I purchased this video for my son who is a green belt in Karate thinking that he would be able to learn from it. I watched it with him and was pleasantly surprised that the techniques were so simple, that I could even perform them. I always thought that stuff like this was only for ""Kung-Fu Masters"", but apparently this video was developed for your ""Average Joe"". The best part is that the instructor not only shows you the techniques, but he also explains the physics behind it so that you can understand why they work. I'm glad I have this video, and I keep showing it to my friends and relatives. With the holiday travel season starting soon. I just wanted everyone to be safe. This is another reason why I even bothered to post this message. God Bless America!"
3,Not the best,"I really like the bag however, it seem's like the storage area is backwards. Where you place the laptop it should be more in the middle of the bag, not the front. If it was in the middle the laptop would have more padding and less of a chance of damage. At some point I will replace this bag and find something with more padding and protection. It does have a lot of storage in the middle."
4,Thrifty option for a billiard glove.,"I ordered a pair of these to try as a billiard glove. They work very well for that. If you don't like the hassle and mess of dealing with chalk, billiard gloves are the way to go as they do make a huge difference in your game. I have a three-finger Cuetec gloveCuetec 3 Finger Billiards Glovewhich is nice but I also wanted something cheap to have on hand for anyone else playing and this fits the bill perfectly. My hand is medium sized and this large fits fine. They are not overly bulky and each glove is interchangeable between right and left. If you like, just snip off the index and pinkie finger for the 3-finger look. I would prefer that these came in black so my green cue-tip chalk doesn't show up as bad. These are good and cheap and it's fun to see the wearer eventually do a Michael Jackson move."
2,not a bad judgement day,ladder matcheddie guerrero tajari vs WGTTda match between da 2 teams were very good some new moves were created and when it was all said and done eddie guerrero with tajari brought home da gold i always enjoy eddie doing da sunset flip powerbomb of da top of da ladder it fits his style and so be use in his matches regulary da other names impressed me for their debut experience n a ladder match this match was ***3/4 very good match

3,Two decent matches...that's all,"I saw other reviews calling this the best pay-per-view ever! They must not have seen many pay-per-views. The Triple H-Nash match was one of the worst title matches ever! Triple H has lost it and Nash never had it. Most of the rest of the card is a boring utter, waste.The only two saving graces are Team Angle v. Eddie and Tajiri & Brock vs The Big Show. The former was a good ladder match with some great spot by Eddie and Benjamin. The strecher match with Brock was a fun one, with a great ending!If your willing to buy for two good matches, go ahead. Otherwise, there are dozen of better pay-per-views to choose from."
2,this was bad,Judgment Day 2003 was not good. The strecher match and the ladder match were the only two good matches. Matches like HHH vs. Kevin Nash and roddy piper vs. mr. america (hogan) are a disgrace. This was just a bad ppv.
2,not that good,The Raw brand has no talent what so ever smackdown is so much better the only good wrestler on raw is the rockBest Matches wereBikini contestTorrie Wilson vs Sable*****Torrie rules Sable droolsWWE Championshipstrecher MatchBrock Lesnar vs Big Show*****
2,Judgement Day more like Insult day-THIS SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHAT CAN I SAY THIS PPV WAS AWFUL WITH ONLY A FEW DECENT MATCHES.The best match was The stretcher match by far.I cant beleive Lesnar got the big Show out of the arena. I give this match 9/10.The Match between Team Angle and Eddie Guerro/Tajiri was also a decent match.Tajiri was a good tag partner choice.New WWE tag team champions-Guerro/Tajiri. The only other good part was thE HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! segment between Torrie and Sable.That was a SLOBBER KNOCKER.Dont bother buying this DVD unless you really want the above matches.This ended up being the worst PPV of 2003.
5,Most inspiring book I've ever read on how to date yourself and date others,"I consider myself someone who is fairly thoughtful and has already made an effort around being spiritually grounded, self-aware and having healthy relationships. This book, however, sets up a pretty profound framework around these things and asks deep questions. It helped me get to a new level of thought about my relationship with myself as well as my romantic relationships. I got an immense amount of good out of this book. It helps peel back the layers and digs deep! After reading it, I bought several copies and handed them out to my closeset friends."
5,A real gift!,"This is by far the best book I've read on relationships in years (and there have been MANY!). The book has come to me when I really need to begin to examine--and understand--the pain that so often accompanies relationships. I DON'T want to keep repeating my pattern of failed relationships, and this book gives me some valuable tools to work with in finding out WHY, learning more about myself, and becoming open, undefended and able to be truly present in my relationship. (But it does require a real commitment to confront our pain and learn from it--sometimes easier said than done!) I thank the authors whole-heartedly."
5,Excellent,"Couldn't put it down. I've been in relationships about having my childhood needs met as the book says and I thought that that's all there was - to have closeness - and now I understand and want to have the intimacy the authors talk about. I've been impacted greatly by the book because now I want more - more of myself and the curiousity and courage to take everything that comes my way as an exploration about me and more because I desire true intimacy, true freedom and true happiness."
5,One of the best I've read on the subject,"I work as a marriage & family therapist, and only happened upon this book after a few colleagues recommended it. This isn't a clinical book, rather it's far more accessible to anyone who's wanting more than a typical self-help book. ""Undefended Love"" goes far beyond the helpful observations about how human personalities are based on attachment, security, protection, and strategies to compensate for wounds. It goes beyond healthy,non-reactive closeness between a couple. It shows a path for couples to find deeper resources within themselves individually that can create a truer foundation for growth and vitality in all their relationships. It's not a quick-fix or easy path, but it does feel quite true and in sync with the newest findings in neuroscience and other psycho-spiritual paradigms. This is a wonderful book I can easily recommend."
5,Out of the miasma comes a powerful book,"Of the proliferation of books purporting to assist one in improving their relationships Undefended Love stands far and away above the average relationship self help book. In spare, eloquent prose the authors describe a process in which the reader is encouraged to face their deepest fears in order to reach a deeper understanding of themselves and their partners and others they are in relationship with. Undefended Love is deeply spiritual, but does not subscribe to any particular religion, therefore can be used universally. The process is simple and can be conducted solo, with a partner, or a group. The use of Undefended Love has impacted my life in too many positive ways to list here, but most importantly it has given me a sense of connection with others and the world I live in."
1,nope,girlfriend said it didn't work. still ended up on the couch. not for super heavy snoring. we need something stronger if you're like me.
3,Product runs small,"My size 13 feet were crushed from the sides in these ""14-15"" sized fins. I had to beat my leg just to divert the pain after I tried them on they hurt so bad. They may work great for a narrow size 10-12?"
2,Eh,"One of my boys really likes tornadoes, so I thought he'd really like this. He liked it, but we can rarely make it looks like a twister."
5,They work well!,I ordered 2 for 2 boys ages 5 & 4 and they love them! They have no problem getting them to form tornadoes!
3,A great stocking stuffer!,I bought this for my little brother who was into tornado's at the time. I was going to buy a more complicated tornado maker but it wasn't in stock at the time. He didn't take interest in this toy for more than a couple of weeks which is usually the fate of all toys anyway. But it does produce a pretty cool little water tornado. Just shake and it usually spins for about five seconds. It has some information on the back about the level tornados and explains the damage each can create which I found interesting. Overall a great toy for a younger child a great stocking stuffer like I said.
2,Pretty cheesy,This was cool once. And not that cool even then. Not sure what I was expecting but this is pretty cheesy
1,For the Money?,"Well, what ya see is what you get. Sounded a little more ""exciting"" from the description. It's nothing. Just a little smaller than your hand. You shake it, spin it, the water twirls around. WoW. No reason to buy this. Doesn't impress even a very young child."
2,Not that good,We have two of these. The one from Cracker Barrel works awesome. This brand doesn't tornado like it should. Pass on it.
4,Fun litle tornado in a jar,My boys saw these at our local science center and they were very over priced. I decided to search around for a better price and this was a great price for them. They are self contained so no water can come out and there are no pieces to come off! Great little product!
2,Not Much To Get Excited About,"This is a small thing that I can shake and twirl to make the water inside spin around, and it shapes into a tornado. No extra packaging or instructions comes with it, so it's just a small thing with water inside. I hoped I could learn more about tornadoes, and thought it was self propelled or somewhat standing for itself, except it is all in your own shaking and twirling it, but in the end it is somewhat nice to have even though its use is minimal, much like a pet rock."
3,"Okay toy, but expected more","I ordered this toy for my grandson who is autistic. He loves anything that spins, so I thought he would enjoy it. This toy is really neat when you shake it just the right way to form a tornado. Only problem is that it's hard for a child to make it form, and it doesn't last long at all. By the time I got the tornado going and handed it to my grandson, it was about gone. It's cheap, so I guess you can't expect much more. It looks cool when the tornado is going, but it's very short-lived."
5,Love my pet tornado!,"It's more than three ounces which means it won't go through TSA unless in checked baggage, but mine survived the journey from Kansas City to Atlanta. Can't get enough of the tiny tornados, just wish there was a tiny cow or barn to fly along inside! I'm buying more as stocking stuffers for Christmas."
1,Waste of money,"First off, this thing is TINY. I was expecting something at least as big as a 20 oz soda bottle, preferably something closer to the 2 liter soda bottle size. This is smaller than a soda can. Secondly, it doesn't even work! It's a small plastic container filled with water and glitter and no matter how much it's shaken or twisted, or whatever, the glitter sloshes around, but no ""tornado"" forms at all. Not even a semblance of one. WASTE OF MONEY. :( I was going to give this to my nephew for Christmas since he's interested in weather related things, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift. :( Poor product!"
2,soooo boring,"it's just sparkles in a jar, shake it and you'll see a tornado for 3 seconds or so then you have to shake again and again. not worth all the effort."
2,Hard to see a tornado or anything in there,It's really hard to see something in there. Even if you shack it in different ways you get hardly any result.
1,Not Impressed,"This is quite basic. It is exactly as it looks. Looks like water with sparkles and sandy stuff inside, shake a little and there's your tornado, really thought there would be more to it."
3,My child loves it,I got this for my 4 and a half year old daughter and she is facinated by it. It's a little hard for her to get going but she's persistant.
3,Eh - Just Okay...,"Bought this for my son for Christmas who loves tornados. It's okay. He plays with it once in a while, although it developed a crack somewhat quickly. You have to shake it to get it to form a mini-tornado that lasts a few seconds. Every once in a while, he shakes it and then it goes back on the shelf. I didn't really feel it was worth the money... I would think this should be a $3 five and dime item. I most likely wouldn't buy it again."
1,Misled!,"Do not buy this single if you are looking for the ballad version of Alive. Silly me, I must have missed when it was clearly stated that the version here was an uptempo one when I ordered it from Amazon, and only got suspicious when the CD arrived and I looked at the back. I'm not a great fan of J-Lo's singing but I do like the ballad version of Alive. However, there is no way I will be buying the remixes CD- what was she thinking putting a ballad on that CD! I guess I will have to enjoy it on radio."
2,Who drew these pictures?,"While the idea of this calendar is attractive, the pictures are not. Some of the artwork is downright ugly. I was so disappointed in the Father's Day week, as I will not use any of the art work in my scrapbook. I guess it's hard to please everyone, but there is a particular artist who seems to have gotten the themes that I really wanted to use and ruined them. I doubt very much that I will buy next year's calendar."
5,Rossini: La Cenerentola,"A 5-star performance! Every member of the cast fills his/her role as near perfection as possible. Other famous mezzos have recorded the leading role, but Bartoli is outstanding."
3,great,"I am very happy with product. great product for the price.It was quickly delivered, the package was great"
4,"Decent, reliable book","I can recommend this book, especially as a place to start and to get an initial feel and importance for various terms. I've actually used it ato look up a couple dozen words so far."
1,Anti-Catholicism at it's worst,"This book is incredibly inaccurate in it's portrayal of the Roman Catholic Church's position on Mary. To claim that Catholics hold Mary as a ""goddess"" is simply a lie. Look in the Catechism!!! Besides all this, to put the ""Biblical Mary"" against the ""Roman Mary"" is ridiculous! The Catholic Church put the Bible together!! Before 395 AD, there was NO bible!! All we had was the Traditions of the Apostles which have been handed down through 2000 years. ""The pillar and foundation of Truth is the Church"" -Timothy 3:16. Not the Bible! The CHURCH. Read the early Church Fathers. They were all undeniably Catholic. Now I ask you...who are you going to believe? A bunch of men who lived 1500 years after Christ, or those men who actually knew the apostles? In short, this book does no justice at all to Catholic beliefs"
2,Didn't like it at all,"I'm not a dentist, but I didn't like this product AT ALL. It is coated with white powdery flakes that spread like dandruff all over the place, before you even begin flossing! Underneath is a stiff, clear plastic film that cuts your gums, and your fingers. I'm a big flosser, and have tried many products (my ""regular"" floss is J&J). Unfortunately this product was a major disappointment and the package was tossed after the first use. The only reason that I didn't give it 1 star is because it didn't shred (before it was tossed) and I did like the minty flavor (before it was tossed)."
2,Disappointing,"After reading Duchess for a Day, I was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment.The hero is so hung up on himself and his wants and his desires, he gives no thought whatsoever to anyone else. He is a very unlikable character. I forced myself to finish it, and I doubt I'll ever pick it up again. There were some high points, but not enough to make overcome the down side. The secondary character Rhys was intersesting though.Would love to see a book about him."
3,Average,"This was an ok book, but not a real page-turner. Phoebe was a lovable character, but after the first few chapters I came to heartily dislike Stephen. His only goal was to convince Phoebe to become his mistress without regard to how the label would affect her life, her position in society, or the life of their children (which Phoebe longed for). Granted his main reason for not wanting to marry Phoebe was a fear that an old family curse might cause her death, but I still found his solution (making her his mistress) a tad selfish. Overall the book was ok, just not one I plan on keeping."
4,A most unusual TV series companion book,"Completely dispensing with the usual behind-the-scenes profiles and interviews that fill book companions to popular TV shows, this one stays completely in character as an amalgam of what might have been bits of scrapbooks from the characters in the show. Well worth getting now at the bargain price for those who came in late, but please watch the first three seasons first, or you'll have some events spoiled for you."
5,Fun Details,"This book is so much fun for the 6 feet under enthusiast. Complete with childhood photos of the ""Fishers"" and stories/journal entries from the characters- it really feels like you have an inside window into the Fisher clan."
5,best book ever,"best book for a six feet under fan! i purchased two other books about the series and they weren't nearly as good as this one. filled with pictures and great information about the series, a must have for any fan of six feet under!"
5,MUST HAVE,I LOVE Six Feet Under and this book was the sweetest icing on the cake! Very interesting insight into characters and background. Neat pictures inside the funeral home and childhood photos. This is a MUST HAVE for any Six Feet Under fan. GREAT BOOK
4,Hype that's worth it.,"Yeah, I'll admit it. This is simply a document to lend credence to the spectacular series (DVD of first season available) of ""Six Feet Under."" In that sense, it's hype. But, since the series is so good, why not?I got this as a surprise for my wife as we're both big fans of the series. From correspondence, documents from the college from which Rico graduated, it's cleverly done, something to make the series all the more ""real.""Again, of course it's hype. But it beats, say, dolls of characters in TV cartoon series and countless other nonsense hypes. And since the series is worthwhile to say the least, this makes it all the more real.For the first time ever, I'll thank the producers for the idea!"
4,Beautiful Voice,"While I may not be a good judge of fret work or song writting style, the singer has a beautiful voice. Touching lyrics. Its poetry."
3,Better than some,I bought this because it was recommended on the EWG site. Mine states that it is Oxybenzone and Paraben-Free.I like it better than California Baby as it doesn't have an odor.It is pretty thick which makes it a bit harder to spread. The kids don't mind the consistency though so that is a big plus.I wish it was a little less expensive. Times are tough and sunscreen is important but shouldn't break the bank.
5,Quality well made mop.,"Very good, durable mop that doesn't get tangled up. I use it too mop the kitchen and the bathrooms. Once its dirty you can just through it in the wash and it comes out new again. This mop is a serious mop for getting your floors clean. I use mine with a Rubbermaid mop bucket and wringer that I got from Amazon also. With the right tools everything gets clean great."
1,EXPENSIVE AND POOR QUALITY,"I was hesitant to purchase lipstick without actually seeing it first but, went ahead anyway. I was happy when the package arrived however, when I opened the package I saw a small, dirty box. Inside was the lipstick, very true to color when I removed the top and looked but, at the same time it had a stale, rancid smell which immediately indicated to me that this product had probably been sitting on a shelf for some time.If I'm going to pay over $10 for a lipstick, it better be new and smell fresh. BEWARE."
3,NOT about autism,"I am a college professor of disability studies, and I bought this DVD to add to my collection of films about disabilities. In this case, the title came up when I was searching for a film on autism. This film is NOT about autism. If you are seeking a film about autism, do not purchase this one.This IS a powerful film in the tradition of Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor and other Southern gothic writers who portrayed a strong sense of place peopled with grotesque characters. It has won several film awards. However, it is decidely not about autism."
4,Things That Hang from Trees,"Things That Hang from TreesOdd, haunting little gem. Not much plot but excellent acting and definitely food for thought!"
5,Good product!,My daughter loves this pen! Even bought an extra one for her friend. I would highly suggest this product to everyone.
3,Neat concept,I only wrote a few things down to test the pin. It's a neat concept. I'll have to write down 'top secret' thingsand see what happens from there.
3,It's okay...,"For what it does, it's an okay purchase.Our son likes to draw (mustaches on his brother especially) and the pen seems to dry out fairly easily. Since it's not really designed for skin drawing, I guess I can't really complain, but even on paper, the ink doesn't seem to last."
2,Never worked,Didnt work the day i got it. I would not recommend this to any body. Not worth the money- why get something that doesnt work.
1,Terrible,"This pen is terrible, don't buy it. It broke before I could even test it! Useless, save your money and don't buy this!"
2,Not worth it.,"My son broke the pen the first day he had it. The felt point pushes back in too easily. It is a cute idea, but I am not sure I would buy it again."
3,Does the job,"Pens have bad luck with me, so it was no surprise that it came close to breaking.The light comes on by twisting one of the caps. So having it in your pocket is not such a great idea.But it does the job.When you write you can see the makings of whatever you wrote, it takes sometime (not sure how long) to fade away, so when you use it make sure you given enough time for it to fade, otherwise it you can tell easily what you wrote.Don't write so big otherwise you won't be able to see the whole letter, as the light that shins is not very big"
3,Neat Idea,"I bought this item in order to keep track of the RSVP's coming back for my wedding incase the returned RSVP was illegeable and I didn't want to be detected :) It's a really great idea and much more reasonable than using a home recipe for invisible ink. The light on my pen was broken when I received it but beacuse I had another UV light around, decided not to return it for that reason."
2,bad,this is terrible after you write something on it a few days latter the ink shows on the paper and anybody can read it.i do not recommend it dont by it because it is cheap it is also terrible.
1,Stay away from the inkjet 1100 series.,"The fact that the price of this printer has already dropped to $217.00 from $300.00 should have been a indication not to touch this printer. To many cons to go through. I've used nothing but HP printers as long as I can remember, but this is the worse printer I have tried to use. When I first got it there were instructions at the HP site for a new driver and new firmware. Took 3 hours to figure out how to upgade firmware with HP instructions. Finally got it reprogrammed. I don't see how this printer even worked with the original firmware. Stay away from this printer. If someone gives it to you for free, throw it in the garbage."
3,Item not as described,"The product entry said ""Used - LIKE NEW"". ""Like New"", in my entire experience, means LIGHT cover wear but no highlighting, underlining, dogeared corners or cracked spine. It means something that looks UN-used. My copy has HIGHLIGHTING, FRAYED edges, and a cracked spine. I am disappointed! I don't know if it's willful misdirection or perhaps this newly launched seller hasn't understood what ""Like New"" means.This item was not as described. I am considering returning it and will contact the seller."
3,Works good,"Works just like it should, Nothing extra to report in that category. It's a lot cheaper than buying at a local pharmacy or medical retailers, I will order again when I need more."
4,"This is J-88 but people, do not 86 it!","If you LOVE slum village like I do get this album as a sample of what was SV B4 Fantastic. I for the most like the calm, smooth and laid back beats and flows supplied, yet the best songs on here are the remixes. Madlib brings great energy and keeps the CCC (Cool, Calm, Collected) feel with his two remixes and the last song is so different that it's cool to hear. Tracks 4-6 have too much of a laid back sound and put me to sleep. This is high quality hip-hop for everyone to enjoy!"
3,"if you like SV, still buy this though!","Jay Dee got lazy on this, but both the look of love songs are great, surprisingly Madlib's first remix is good also. The other songs can be enjoyable, but to me at least they sound way to cheezy some times. I would have gave it four, but the last remix is absolutely horrible.. 'broken beat'? oh my gosh it's horrible and that's no personal opinion.if you are a big fan of SV like you should be, you should get this just to be a good fan, I guess (and for the look of love songs). but, I could see that this would be really annoying if you didn't like Fantastic Vol. 2 in the first place..I am pretty glad I bought it, just for those two songs."
3,"Pick it up, if you are a Slum fan.","J-88 is Slum Village under an alias. If you own Fantastic Vol. 2 by Slum Village then you will like this EP. It has seven songs and three remixes. I was disappointed that it did not have the remix of The Look Of Love on here. But, the last three remixes, which are the album's saving grace make up for it. There is no development of the lyrics, it's just the same content from SV. The beats are on point and Madlib provides a dope remix of The Things You Do. I have heard some say that they like Best Kept Secret better than Fantastic Vol. 2. Personally, I thought Fantastic Vol. 2 was better. But, this EP is still worth checking out."
3,3.5 starz baby!!!!,"YO THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY TIGHT, BUT FANTASTIC VOL.2 EDGES IT OUT THOUGH(COP THAT ALBUM IF U DO NOT HAVE IT). I HEARD THIS ALBUM A COUPLE OF DAYZ AGO AND FELT THE BEATS. JAY DEE IS A VERY CREATIVE PRODUCER AND THE GROUP ITSELF ALSO. I AM A SLUM V FAN AND JUST LIKE TO SAY ""GET DIS MONEY."""
4,Alka-Seltzer plus cold tablets,"These Alka-Seltzer Plus fizzy cold tablets are wonderful. Taste great and the fizz going down feels kinda nice. But the three pack boxes of 48 at this price is wonderful. Works wonders on cold symptoms so I can sleep and survive the day. Only bitch is that the 48 cough is a bit deceptive as each 48 tablet box only offers 24 doses, but I am tuned into the fast and loose number games and am ok with it now."
1,Holy hell batman!,That is a LOT of cost for a 2.1GB no matter the software included... Could have at least put it on a 200GB... Geesh.
1,I should have shuttered my wallet .....,"It's books like this that should make me happy to be a reviewer if only to warn others of it's abject stupidity.I guess, first published in 1906 as a private collection of 150 copies, the Grove Press, in one of their weaker editorial moments, dedcided to run this Blue Moon novel in 1987.The book is a first person account of exactly what the title says, I guess that makes me the fools, whereby the narrator basically goes to over 14 different houses of ill repute at the turn of the century in Paris and describes what he sees. I guess if you are into classic wallpaper of furniture this shoiuld be a reference novel ...So lets see what does this book have, plot .. NO, any emotion other than boredom... NO, eroticism... NO, sex .... barley noticable, any, and I mean any semblance of any story .... NO ... save your hard earned mony fols .... tis is THE WORST"
5,Essential for a great Eagle Court of Honor,Very well laid out...a quick read that contains great ideas and sample formats for the big night.
5,EVERYTHING you need to plan ECOH!,"As a mom who didn't know everything Scouting, this was invaluable in helping me plan our son's Eagle Court of Honor. It explained EVERYTHING and I went from PANIC to PRIDE. After reading this, I could easily plan another or at least be able to explain to someone (equally as confused) exactly what's needed and what's not! Thank YOU, Mark Ray!"
4,Great planning for the eagle ceremony,"We bought this book for our son's eagle ceremony, It was extremely helpful although some of the ceremony is out of order per our local council. You should check with your scoutmaster and/or council before finalizing the ceremony details like we did. We donated the book to the ""Eagle kit"" for future eagle scouts from our troop. Great, great resourse, highly recommend it."
4,Planning An Eagle Court Of Honor,"While my wife and I had firm ideas of what we wanted to do for our son's Court of Honor, the content in this book helps you tie things together. Also, like any large social function, there are many facets to it and the book helps you with the management of plannning and executing the event.There are not really many (or any) ideas outside of the box, but that's why you have parents, friends and the input of the Scout, and that's to generate new and fresh ideas for this most important event in a boy's life.Overall, a very good resource."
5,search & rescue,"Paid for itself already! Easily retrieves balls, 12' length is plenty long enough, picked up 20 other people's balls first round."
5,adapter for ultrabay,Perfect and on time Harddrive works great. Price good. Now my IBM T43 has a spare drive. Once main drive breaks it becomes a door stop. Original drive refuses to clone. Ultra bay is great.Daniele
5,Excellent 2nd HD adapter,"This adapter lets you use a 2nd hard disk as a backup, enabling a very affordable solution to increase your storageThe caddy system works as expected, without any difficulties considering that the mechanical alignment is criticalI'm pretty satisfied and glad to recomend it for further consideration"
2,thousand songs and im really disappointed!!!,"Hi,who ever picked out the song list of these three great singers of all time need to really need to take another look.Songs are as dull as a rock......be sure to look at the songs listed....they sung millions of songs and how they happened to get stuck on the set i wonder....Frank,Dean and Sammy are the greatest!!!!"
5,Great book for non-=musical people.,I have been musically inept my entire life and have never been able to play any thing at all. Now after 50 years of no music I can play pretty well even if I only use one hand to do it. (I can't do the head and belly thing either) The print is large enough to help with my bad eyesight as well.
2,Marginal at best,"Sorry, but this book was so juvenile as to be worthless. I would not recommend it for any musician trying to learn new material. It was a waste of time and money for me."
3,Hella it's just his nick name!!,"Be aware!! This Fog Light is not a genuine Hella product, the brand is Hellausa or some. It's not what I spected but it will work if what you are looking for is just to pimp your car."
4,I like em...,"These were pretty decent looking fog lights. They are more of an oval shape than circular like I thought they were so make sure you've got room for an oval shaped light. They might still fit in my bumber(97 saturn sl2) but I've decided I'm going to sell my car and I'm not going to waste my time installing them if I'm going to sell my car. But I might put them on my gf's alero. These lights have a decent light output, they're not xenon lights so dont expect that. They've got the typically light bulb color like normal halogen headlight bulbs which was fine for me at the time. If I decide to put them on my next car, I might consider puttin HIDs in them. But you cant beat the metal casing, its extremely strong and looks great. The box they came in looked like it had been opened and the hardeware bag and been opened and I ordered these new, not used, but that didnt bother me as long as the lights still worked."
2,High hopes but doesn't work for kitty litter,I had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews. I wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs -- not heavy cleaning -- but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup (rescued mother cat and 4 kittens). It does a good job for lint and hair but doesn't work on kitty litter. It spits it around or keeps in roller section. I thought I was using it wrong and tried it every way -- but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it's turned off. I'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum.
3,OK for touch ups . . .,". . . which is, of course, what it's intended for, I guess. It clogs pretty easily, and it must be made to constantly push forward because when you pull it back and then push it forward again, it leaves a line of dirt/dust at the point where you stopped and reversed direction. Might not notice it on carpet, but it's pretty obvious on hardwood and tile. Annoying."
3,Handy if limited,"Having inherited the older version, I bought this for little more than the replacement battery.It works like a hand vacuum except from the standing position. It picks up about the amount of dirt a hand vacuum would. Unlike the old version, you no longer recharge it from the standing position, which is too bad.Overall, I like it and am glad I bought it."
4,Handy vac,"I would say it works pretty well for what we need it for. It does a decent job on carpet and hard floors. Of course there will alway be the bits that you have to attack a couple of times but it does the job. This is not made for big areas, just small jobs, as the dirt compartment fills up quickly. The run time is about 5 to 7 minutes so that is why it didn't get that extra star."
2,Very disappointed,"Do not get this sweeper. It does not do a good job and it is to small and cannot go over carpet. The Bissell ""perfectsweep Turbo"" does exactly what you want. The charge lasts longer than 10 to 12 minutes. And the pefect sweep lasts up to 60 minutes. I am very sorry I wasted my time buying the small sweeper. I wanted a second sweeper for my upstairs but this is not the one!"
4,Super Convenient,"Great little sweeper when you need a quick pickup. The battery lasts approximately 13-15 minutes and as long as you keep the dust cup clean, this little vac works great!"
5,Love It!,"I love this vacuum! It is great for doing quick jobs around the house, vacuuming the stairs and vacuuming up the lint in the laundry room. I would highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone. I love that you can use it like a dustbuster to clean to car or use the long arm to do regular cleaning."
1,Don't waste your money !,"In my opinion - an absolute piece of junk. The handle kept pulling off the unit while in use, it took three charges and wouldn't recharge after that. I had to keep going over popcorn kernels several times before it picked up. What a waste of my time and money !"
4,A decent cordless sweeper-vac,"It is a handy, quick to use sweeper-vacuum. It has a roller brush to sweep and a small vacuum motor to really pick up small items with the dust, dirt and hair. I have used it to pick up hair (human and cat),fuzzies and hard particles of food, cat litter and paper scraps on tile, vinyl, hardwood and carpet. It does a good job as quick clean up between regular vacuuming. It does not have an on/off button - just tilt the handle toward you and off you go! The waste cup has a filter and is easy to dump clean. It performs exactly like the description."
4,Did a nice job,"We (me and my wife) gifted this to a friend of us as she is pregnant now. She couldn't lift heavy vacuum cleaners to clean up her apartment. This one made cleaning much easier for her. As expected from a cordless sweeper, you can use it only for around 20 minutes continuously. This gift made her happy and we are happy too.the unit is extremely light and easy to use. very less noise !!. The brush helps even sticky stuff to come off carpets."
3,Better on carpet than hard floors,"I have 2 small children and wanted something to pick up the cheerios and goldfish. This vacuum works great on carpets and is so much easier than pulling out the regular vacuum.Unfortunately, it does not pick up as well on my kitchen floor, which is why I purchased it. It does ok on crumbs, but I usually have to run over the crumbs a few times before it gets everything. And it cannot pick up anything bigger than a crumb."
3,Does what it says it will do,"In the end I'm basically pleased with this product. Obviously it doesn't hold that much debris, and in a large, old, hardwood floored house - I was hoping to get more of a run out of it before having to empty the receptacle on the vacuum. But it has great oomph and pick up power and is very light - perfect for my stairs. The only issue is if you're vacuuming anything other light-weight dust or debris. Particles that are heavy like bits of food just kick around the brush underneath and shoot out over the floor - never really get sucked up.Over all a good buy though. I needed something to do my stairs and it perfect."
2,How about a replacement battery?? save the planet?,"Very low power but good as a hand vac with a stick. Battery very very weak for a hand vac. Replacements should be available. Otherwise, bad for environment as you have to toss the entire thing after about a year and a half. I liked it while it lasted but that doesnt count in the long run does it?"
1,Don't Buy,"This product has little power. After very few uses, the charger will not work well, providing only two or three minutes of power. The dust cup falls off during use. It should be removed from Amazon's inventory."
1,Stopped recharging,It was ok for the first month. Then it stopped recharging properly and after recharge it works only for a minute or 2.
4,GO-GO-GO,The GO-VAC is good for quick clean up of crumbs and lint. I use one at the hotel I work for and also have one at home. It is a good helper.
1,don't waste your money!,"I bought this sweeper thinking it would be useful in cleaning up cat litter and everyday grit that gets tracked into the house. It was a very disappointing product, especially since it is by Bissell, who I thought made decent vacuum cleaners. This sweeper doesn't hold a charge for longer than 5 minutes, throws the cat litter around instead of picking it up, grinds up Cheerios and leaves the powder behind, and is a real piece of C***! Save yourself the money and buy a manual carpet sweeper or else use a Dustbuster!"
5,Everything this guy does is just impresssive.,"I have been Eros's fan for almost 20 years, and it seems everything he does just has to be perfect, and every release is better than the previous. This concert is incredibly amazing, the visual effects, the sound, the crowd, the musicians is just great. Just to give a better idea of how impressive are the visual effects in this concert, the director is the same one that the cirque du soleil used in Las Vegas for the Criss Angel's Believe show, the Canadian Serge Denoncourt.Anyways, I recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to enjoy a couple of hours of great music and great stage and visual effects."
1,PAL instead of NTSC,"Although Amazon posted the format as NTSC, the version of this DVD I received is PAL so would not play on (North American) standard DVD player.My DVD and Blue Ray player don't play PAL format so I was not able to view the DVD, I am really mad.I bought two as gifts, how is this possible? selling a European format in America? but now Amazon show for this produc: ""Imported and PAL Format"".But is too late for me :'o("
5,You will learn so much with this book!,"I am just completing Dr. Rood's course at Washburn Univ. and from the student's perspective, I think his book is terrific. I found it to be both challenging and interesting, and I would say it's been an excellent tool for me in beginning to learn what programming is all about and how programs are structured. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about using it to teach a course, because I think most students find it a good and helpful book with good practice problems. I would also recommend it to anyone who's just interested in picking up a book about programming and trying to learn how things work."
5,A brilliant examination of legal thought,"Professor Weinreb's description of the analogical nature of legal reasoning will be immediately convincing to any experienced lawyer, and his defense of analogy against its academic detractors is equally persuasive. Unlike a great deal of trendy ""interdisciplinary"" scholarship, Weinreb is sure-footed and effective in his use of psychological research into analogical thought, and he is equally sophisticated in handling the jurisprudential issues. The book is written with the clarity and simplicity of a true master. This is a must read for anyone interested in how lawyers and judges think ... and should think."
4,Gorgeous in any Home,"Whether you decorate contemporary, classic or country, this vase will look beautiful. The silver look is very versatile. The vase is the perfect size for flowers and for decorating. It is very sturdy. Just wait and see how many compliments you receive once you put it in your home!"
4,Action Packed Thriller,"This is an action packed thriller that combines the supernatural, a spiritual oddyssey or two, and lots of action.The way that Wilson weaves the spiritual warfare into his plot is reminiscent of Frank Peretti. Some of the dark, bizarre parts are a bit like Koontz.Dark to Mortal Eyes is anything but predictable. It takes several twists and turns that are totally unexpected. It is so well done that I am quite surprised that it is just Wilson's first novel. I certainly hope that he continues to write as he is obviously a major talent."
4,R&B TIMECAPSULE,"The first half of this really excellent blues/funky R & B album is really right on the money. The second is the Poontangs (a cover name for the Johnny Otis Show) and while the musicianship is just as blistering, the lyrics are so raunchy it will blow your mind. Play this for a very select few or you will get thrown out of the house! Fun and funky and skillfully played the whole way through -- just put the kids to bed!"
2,Not interesting,"I wasn't engaged by the story. There was some value in the book as a window into another culture, but aside from that, I don't recommend it."
4,Another Triumph For Martha,"This book is a great companion to the two previous Christmas / Holiday Books from Martha Stewart Living. With signature style and grace, she presents us with beautiful crafts to make to decorate our homes and give as gifts. Martha has definately done it again!!!"
2,Best MLB producted World Series video to date...but with a BIG catch,"This is the best MLB produced World Series DVD to date--but with one BIG catch. There is an UNBELIEVAEBLY annoying MLB logo that is in the top right of the video. And it is there for the ENTIRE VIDEO. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll love this DVD.If, however, it drives you CRAZY (like it does me) that a DVD you purchased for $15-20 that has a permanent MLB tag through the ENTIRE video, then you probably won't like this. I (for one) won't buy another World Series DVD until MLB gets rid of this logo.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
3,Disappointing . . .,"For starters, the title is rather misleading-- the book is as much about Asperger's Syndrom, Tourette Syndrom, and ADHD as about Bipolar. Unless your child suffers some combination of these different illnesses, much of the material isn't helpful.Other material was unhelpful to me as it applied to children much younger than my son (age 16), but that would of course be different for other readers.There is useful advice, but it is neither especially novel nor particularly well organized. A chapter with rather uncritical enthusiasm for ""naturopathic"" remedies (among which Lynn strangely includes ECT!) also undermines the credibility of the book.In short-- you can do better, even just with online resources."
5,Very thorough book,"This has pretty much everything you need to know about bipolar syndrome for children and teens, including info about children with multiple syndromes. It's easy to read and fascinating."
4,Success Can Be Achieved,Everyone should read this book just for it's wonderful strategies and ideas. All parents can find something to take from this book.
5,HELP FOR PARENTS!!!!!!!,THIS BOOK IS SO HELPFUL. I REFER BACK TO IT QUITE FREQUENTLY AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FRIENDS WHO ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION.
5,absolutely gorgeous,"this new volume reveals an astonishing beauty that the world has been deprived of until now... just like the editorial review says, it is like an ethiopian Satie..."
1,"Two books, good content.","A man in Austin, Texas, Jim Comer, wrote a book with this title about dealing with his elderly parents as an only child. It has fabulous charts, suggestions, how tos, and more. It's been recently republished as ""When Roles Reverse.""If her book is anything like Comer's, it's a worthwhile read for anyone with aging parents or siblings they will need to care for!"
5,Small but useful,"somehow this was much smaller than I had imagined it to be, but it has been very useful for cooking a variety of dishes from chicken to fish. It makes an a pretty serving dish as well, so it can go from oven to table."
1,the downfall of the wwe- bad blood dule as hell,"whoever is reading this it dosen't have to do with bad blood. this is my opion about the wwe. since wwf takeover happened wwe went down totally by excepting the wcw roster. the wwf had a big enough roster as it is and then they added 2nd rate stars. I know kevin nash, goldberg, and other stars are good wrestlers but they can't compare to the rock, HHH, stonecold, and etc. also what's with this general manager ... I don't want to watch raw just because HHH and the rock are on it. any way I will talk about bad blood. the event was very dule compared to vengance. come on I know ric flair and sean michaels are legnds but this match would of only been good ten years ago. of course the hell in a cell wasn't all bad. Of course my favorite match would of been y2j vs bill goldberg which was dissapoting because the fued was exciting unlike the match."
2,Not that good,"This ppv was not that good. Nash/HHH was not a good hell in a cell regardless of what people say. It was terrible compared to other HIAC's. HBK/Flair was pretty good, and booker and christian was okay. All in all it was an okay ppv, but i recommend not to buy it, there is much better out there."

2,"""Bad Blood 2003"" DVD Review","Bad Blood 2003 was the type of underwhelming pay-per-view that the WWE has come to be known by. ""Bad Blood"" was headlined by a Hell In A Cell match between Kevin Nash and Triple-H. Since neither man is known for risk-taking moves, this one was average. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho had a nice build-up which led to the eventual Goldberg squash. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair was a ""dream match"" of sorts but didn't exactly play out like one. With no title involved and Flair more or less playing a Helmsley lackey, these days, this match really didn't have the emotion it deserved. The rest of the card was nothing you couldn't and don't see on a weekly basis on RAW. The Austin-Bischoff ""Redneck Challenge"" was three segments worth of lame attempts to be humorous including a ""Pie-Eating"" contest (""pie"" is what the nine-year-old child known as the WWE uses to talk dirty about the vagina area.)"

2,Horrible!,This was one of the worst PPV's I've ever seen.The matches that were posted were awesome! But they were soooo boring!Especially when you have a match likeTRIPLE H VS KEVIN NASH IN A HELL IN THE CELL MATCH!!!That match was terrible!! The worst Hell in the Cell match ever!It seemed like these two men were just trying to get it over with! C'mon guys!!Goldberg vs Jerico was an all right match. Nothing new....Flair vs Michals was the only match that got me all excitedThose two men did a great job.The rest of the matches were all right....Not good enough though...I can't believe I payed for this crap...I'm giving this 2 stars just for the Flair HBK match....
2,Not very good at all!,The only reason I didn't give Bad Blood 2003 a 1 rating is because Chris Jericho carried Goldberg to a good match. The rest of the matches wre pretty bad. The hell in a cell match was an average hell in a cell match. It was the second worst HIAC next to taker vs. bossman from wrestlemania 15. Overall Bad Blood 2003 was just bad.
2,Worst of 2003 so far.,Anyone who gave this PPV 5 stars must have forgotten the quality of the product the last few years. As the first Brand exclusive PPV I had high hopes for this show but it turned out to be a big letdown. The Vengeance PPV the following month was better in just about every aspect. That is the DVD that you should spend your money on.
3,WWE Blood Bad 2003 review,"The Dudley Boys-Rodney Mack/Christopher Nowinski tag team match was brong as heck. The Test-Scott Steiner match was not great but pretty good. The Booker T-Christian-IC title match was a solid back-and-forth brawl ruined by the DQ ending. The RVD/Kane-La Resistance-World's tag team title match was above-average for a PPV title match. The Goldberg-Chris Jericho match was a so-so,sloppy at some points brawl. The Ric Flair-HBK match was a old-school,hard-hitting,back-and-forth match. The HHH-Kevin Nash-HITC match for the World's title was a hardcore,bloody,hard-fought brawl. I give this PPV a 4 out of 10."
2,Short and not sweet,"I recently bought this PPV for..well i honestly cant remember why I bought this. The matches were quick and seemed to be rushed together. Jericho-Goldberg had a good story line but didnt really deliver. I dont know why Goldberg had a problem with the WWE. He said they made him look stupid. Did he forget about his stint in WCW? Hell in the Cell was a good match but short. It started off as a match then got into a street fight. The hammer shots by Triple H on Nash's leg were brutal. The head shot faded away, so I dont know how he pulled that off. The rest of the match lagged; I laughed at the fan at ringside that had the sign Big Lazy. The PPV isn't really worth the money unless your making that picture that all 2003 dvds make."
2,"An overhyped, but decent PPV","This was an okay PPV. Goldberg vs Jericho was pretty cool. Expected more from Kane & RVD since they were awesome. HHH vs Nash was overhyped, but still brutal. Overall, an okay PPV. Rent this one, maybe.**Oh yeah. Who was the kid who said there was a Kane vs Goldberg Chain Cage Match. I was dissapointed to find out that that match wasn't on the card. It sounded awesome. Could anyone who knows if this took place email me telling me when. I would greatly appreciate it."

2,bad blood=bad ppv,"For raw's first ppv you would think they would have made it better. I love wrestling,don't get me wrong but this was stale. The only two matches worth watching wa Flair and Michaels which was excellent. And of course the main event with Nash and HHH in Hell in a Cell. Other than that it isn't worth it. This is coing from a fan of 18 years. So borrow it from a friend or something."
1,I'd give it NEGATIVE stars but I had to pick the lowest here,"The fact that people can actually call ANYTHING on this PPV good makes me want to vomit with rage. NOTHING on this card was enjoyable for a PPV, it was like watching a BAD episode of Raw, except spending $35 on the crap.Flair/HBK sucked a$$. I don't care if someone went through 5000 tables, the match blew. Period.Steiner/Test good? Ha! I want what everyone else is smoking. Only good thing was steiners fall from the apron BEFORE the match.HHH/Nash was decent, but sucked for a Hell in a Cell match.French/Kane & RVD was flat out boring, plus I still can't tell which is which! (the French guys, not Kane or RVD)Whatever I didn't mention also sucked.Buy ANY WWE DVD besides this one. Just an awful 155 minutes."

2,discarded edition,"When I got this book from the mail box, I found it was discarded from a public library. ""DISCARD"" was signeted on the bottom. But it's okay except that the alarm rings whenever I pass through the safety zone in my school library. The book was surely discarded without erasing electronic safety code."
5,The Best Account I Have Read,"This is the best account of wartime experiences that I have read.It has everything that an exciting story should have. And it is a true story. Middlebrook must have been the most agressive pilot who survived the war. If he had exagerated what he did, there are people still alive to contradict him, so I believe him. His actions always put himself and his crews into maximum danger to accomplish their mission of bombing and killing the enemy. But he approached each mission in a thoughtful, calculated way to maximize his chances of success.Surely there were times when Middlebrook made a mistake. But there were none in this story except where he shouldn't have proceeded with flying a mission where all the other pilots turned back. A great story told by a exceptional storyteller."
1,WORST COMPANY EVER!!!,They sent me the wrong part and i called them 4 times with no answer(during their business hours) and left a message each time. Now I'm stuck with the wrong part. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!
4,"Yanaho Digital Sound Projector is a ""home run""","We wanted to add big sound to our new HD TV but didn't want to run wires under the carpeting (or hire someone to go into baseboards and walls). So, when we heard the Yamaha digital sound projector the first time we knew it was a winner. We have a big room so the big Yamaha with 40 speakers and 2 woofers was the solution. Also had to add the Yamaha sub-woofer to get the full range of sound. Easy to hook up and adjust using the instructions. This is a great solution to big sound using the projection system to bounce sound around to room. Highly recommend this product."
5,Brilliant product!,"Brilliant! Have purchased (and returned), other products that pretend to deliver (simulated or true) surround sound, 5.1. The Yamaha YSP is the only product to deliver. None, on the market contain the achieved, high technology, with presence that this unit delivers. It is scary to look to the extreme left or right and hear voices and see nothing there. The sound field is detailed and complexly powerful. A sub-woofer is a must have. The YSP 1100 is the best value of the series. It can be had in the $500+ range, but has the same power output as the 4000/4050. Less power is not worth the effort. Many surround sound units do not sound good with CDs. This unit does an excellent job. Very clean look. Have spent many hours playing with the manual settings. The very painless auto calibration system works just as well. Outstanding technology, well positioned as ""state of the art""."

2,Fun concept but not durable,"The rubber feels relatively durable and this is a great toy for photo opportunities. However, within less than 5 minutes, my boxer/hound started chipping away from the tip of the tongue. He is pretty hard on toys though. My other two dogs probably would have savored it for a few days before focus turned to destroying it."
4,Awesome!,"Great toy but I really should have ordered a smaller size. I own a corgi, which is a big dog in a small body, and need to always order big dog toys because she tends to ""use"" (or abuse) them in a big dog way. And even though the larger toy might be a bit hard to carry in her mouth...I still am satisfied with the purchase."
3,"good for a laugh, but that's about it","This is good for a laugh, but none of the dogs were actually interested in the toy itself. You can put some peanut butter in the ball to get them interested in it, but even then they lost interest pretty fast."
4,Very Nice...,I am quite happy with this item. We were looking for something pretty but not too fancy and this fit the bill perfectly.
2,Sharpness,DRILL BITS NEED TO BE SHARP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! These can be sharpen with a lot of work and then are an ok set of Forstner bits.
5,Satisfied Customer,"Everything about the bits/cutters, price, delivery, condition, etc. I am very satisfied with the outcome of my purchase. Thank you for such a great transaction."
2,Think twice before you buy this set...,"First of all the bit set is made in China... Wow, what a surprise!!! I thought it will be like Katana, Freud or MLCS (like it supposed to be) - made in USA at lease, but not in China.Secondly, the bits are NOT SHARP at all. They look like (actually they are) sharpened by hand file. The cutting edges have small splinters, a tiny spikes that tears and burns the wood in place of clear cut. I'm disappointed... The only good thing in this set is nice and solid wooden box that I'm going to use for my router bits. I don't recommend this set."
4,Great value.,"I inspected the 7/8"" bit I used today, and saw no significant problems with quality and finish. Perhaps a tiny burr here or there. After reading other reviews I had thought I might need to do a little filing or something, but that was not that case. For my purposes, it worked great. I am not doing fine woodworking, but needed some good flat-bottomed holes. Seems like a great value."
2,Not sharp. Not at all.,"I read a few reviews before ordering these, and I felt I had been properly warned: these are not excellent bits, but they're OK for occasional use.Well, they're not really even that good.They're simply not sharp. And when I say not sharp, I mean it takes a couple of MINUTES to drill a 1/2-inch hole through an inch-thick piece of oak. Did I say drill? I meant burn.I'm a casual woodworker, so I have modest needs and my expectations were low. I'm in no rush. But... these things are abysmal. I would have been smarter to look for a set with half as many bits, twice as sharp as these."
2,Very compete set but....,"This set includes most of the bit sizes you will ever need and then some. The problem is, as others have mentioned, some of the bits are very dull. The first one I used was soooo dull it took 20 or so plunges to get through a 3/4 inch pine board. Smoke and burning wood were evident. Too bad, otherwise would have given 5 stars due to the great price and sizes included."
1,Rusted right out of the box.,"All 16 of the pieces I got were rusted. Only one of them had the size printed on it (faintly). The only way to tell the others apart is by the plastic cap on the end. Another reviewer mentioned that they weren't sharp. I didn't find that to be the case, mine were sharp but they still didn't remove chips at all. Had to back the bit out multiple times to clear the chips. I would expect them not to be the highest quality for 20 bucks but I didn't expect them to be this bad. To the sellers credit, they did give me a partial refund due to the rust. Still not a quality product at all.EDIT: Tried out a few more bits today. There is actually a flash from machining on the cutting edges of at least two of these bits and both of them had a wobble. They are straight up garbage. Discount or no, look elsewhere. These things are completely worthless."
3,cheap in every way,This is not the drill bit set you buy for a woodshop but if you a diy-er and you want to have a variety of bit sizes lying around these are worth the price. The bits are far from great alot of the bits arent even centered on the shank and the burn the heck oout of the wood. However they work and helped me finish my project. (a cnc machine that I built from [...]).
5,Master Black,"The man just makes me laugh. The combination of witty New York Jew and disgruntled conspiracy theorist is a winner. While the profanity is prevalent, I attribute it to the HBO stand-up tradition. May Lewis thrive. Buy this now."
5,Funny Dude,"Lewis Black is one damn funny dude, this is the third DVD of his that I have purchased and truly wish that there were more of his shows available."
5,F*ing Hilarious,"Lewis Black is histerical!! If you are a fan of his or are just hating our administration this dvd is a must. If you like comments about stuff that is going on these days and love the F word then Lewis is your man! Highly recommended and have watched a million times, I love Lewis Black!"
4,"Raw, unadulterated Lewis Black - funny and truthful.","This is a must-own for any Lewis Black fans, and is my 2nd-favorite of his routines (the first being ""The End of the Universe""). It's the best kind of stand-up comedy: intelligent, angry and political - interwoven with a healthy dose of swearing."
5,Lewis Black Rocks!,"Frustrated with life these days? Don't know how to unleash your emotions? Would like to rant, but can't do it in polite society? Lewis Black is your ticket! Life won't improve because you've watched his Broadway gig, but your mood might. This is not comedy for all: no slapstick, no dumb adolescent jokes. But for those who are ""with it"" but don't necessarily like ""it,"" this video provides welcome, sophisticated relief!"
3,Lewis is just being Lewis,"- It's not a bad DVD, but if you have seen his work before. It's just Lewis so as you know. It has pieces that you really will laugh, but sometimes he is just saying so much about one subject is not funny anymore.But is facial expression with is stand up a really good, you can buy it, garranteed to laugh. But if you have seen it once, you don't wanna see it twice."
2,Average at best,"First let me say that I am a big Lewis Black fan. His ""Unleashed"" DVD was great and he was hilarious on the Daily Show. That being said this DVD was really lacking. Usually his anger is followed up by something funny but this was just boring. A lot of the jokes were unoriginal and anger is only good for so many laughs. I found myself thinking ""I hope this gets better"" throughout the entire routine. It definitely has its funny parts and may be worth a rental but overall a poor performance."
1,Not funny at all,"Just another non-funny Liberal view of the world. With all the recent Obama administration mishaps, and nothing from Lewis Black on the antics going on, Lewis reveals his true, biased colors. Bye bye, Lewis!"
4,Had to Come Back for More,"After having watched Lewis Black Unleashed; what now? Simple get Lewis Black on Broadway. Newer material with more laughter and enjoyment. As a non-American I once again enjoyed the good natured fun, poked at America and its citizens. Seems that wherever you go in the world, you have the same stereotypes, giving comedians enough material to carry on for hours. Especially covering politics."
5,Excellent,"This is a gift to my mother, and she love's it. It have and excellent fragrance. I recommend to every women that like this kind of product and to every women that likes elegance on a fragrance."
1,I am disappointed with amazon's return policy on colognes,"I have ordered many things from Amazon in previous years and I have always been satisfied. But i did not realize that there was a no-return policy with perfumes and colonges. I use Irrestible by Givenchy and a friend recommended Organza. I ordered it, opened one end ( in case I wanted to return it if I did not like it)Ha HaI hate the fragrance and since Amazon will not take it back I am stuck with a $45.00 bottle of Parfum that I cannot stand. I still order from Amazon BUT with much care.I will never order perfumes from Amazon again. I have returned things to QVC and Sephora without questions being asked from me. But I bought me a real hard lesson with this purchase.Emily Whitfield"
1,what did they do to the smell,This is not at all the perfume it once was. I finally found the original smell in the department store - Organza Indecence. Givency should make it clear to the customer that they messed with the product.
1,not the real fragrance...its just water and ...,I am very disappointed with this purchase...the fragrance is NOT the real thing. It's not the original Organza perfume...it's mostly water. Maybe the only thing real about it is the package...pay a little bit more and go to Macys!
1,Product never came,"I was disappointed to find out, long after I placed the order, that it was not available. I had to make an inquiry, as the seller did not contact me about its unavailability. I was disappointed, as it was a holiday gift."
1,The item was misrepresented,I was so upset when i received my package. Amazon was very misleading in their marketing of Givenchy Organza idecence. I was under the impression that i ordered Indecence but was delivered plain Givenchy Organza. Amazon will not accept perfume returns. I feel completely duped and disappointed as i am a very good customer.
4,Good option,It was not easy to find this on stores. We knew the product before buying it here. A good product.
1,Don't Waste Time Dealing with SF Planet,"I order the stylus for my PPC 6700 and it took SF Planet 4 days to send an email saying they canceled my order because the item was out of stock. The web site says it is still in stock. I wouldn't waste time ordering from SF Planet, they obviously have inventory management issues. If you are in a hurry for replacement parts don't waste time with SF Planet."
3,Styli Were Made to Lose,I've already lost 2 styli and broken one of the new one's with a pen. It's kitch but it works.
5,My little rail fan LOVES it!,"This DVD box set is wonderful. It shows a wide variety of trains (steam engines, diesel engines, city trolleys, etc.) in a wide variety of settings. My 4 year old son is a HUGE train fanatic and loves these DVDs. His favorite is the steam engine which goes through Colorado. I love watching it too since the scenery is so beautiful. It's narated and gives good information about the areas they travel through as well as the trains and the particular railroad's history. But, it's not too much information. There are lots of parts with just music and scenes of great trains riding down the track. This box set is a new favorite in our house."
1,Whose grandpa shot these things?,"I agree with R. Pearson. I realize that real RR fans will probably love to see the equipment and the routes and so on. And I guess they like this set. But I'm just a guy who likes travel documentaries with a certain level of production values. And these DVDs DO NOT have production values. It looks to me like the chamber of commerce got a staffer's grandpa who volunteered to shoot these things on his old gear. They mostly look as bad as VHS tapes. The video is low-rez and jaggy-ridden. The scenery mostly looks dreary, because of the dreadful videography. A lot of stuff is shot through dirty train windows. And so on. The narration is clunky in its scripting, and the voice talent again sounds like a chamber of commerce volunteer. The canned music, ick. Even though I paid just $3 for this thing, I feel like wasted my money. Just an awful, awful set."
2,BEWARE,"Yes watch out, pls always try to read review before buying. Its true the picture is deceiving, but what I don't understand is why Amazon keep using this picture."
3,Disappointing photo,"This accessory kit contains a filter and the blue soft mop pad. Look carefully at the photo and you MIGHT THINK you are getting the red scrub brush. This was the mistake I made looking at the photo and assuming I was getting the blue and the red pad. I should read the fine print carefully. This was my mistake, but since the photo IS deceiving, I'm only giving this item a 3! I really wanted the red pad (which is available through Bissell's customer service)."
1,Disappointed,I'm unable to rate this product since it didn't include the items as advertised. The advertised item contained a flip-it pad and a brush (which is the main reason I ordered it in the first place. I was very disappointed to find the contents were not what I'd hoped for.
2,not what ordered,"I believed that I would be receiving two blue pads and a filter (as pictured) and received a new red brush (which I already have). After reading the reviews just now, I'm not the only one who didn't receive what they ordered, but it was amazing to see the different ways things went wrong with people's orders."
1,Item does not fit,I ordered this item because it was recommended by Amazon as something that would work with the main item (The Bissell Flip-It)I had ordered. It does not fit and since I did not save the papers or the wrapping I am unable to return it.
4,fun book!,This is a very good book.Dana is all through with love..and so is some other boy..i cant remember his name.So Elizabeth has a good idea..she is going to plan and plot to get the two together.'its perfect' she thinks.But Todd thinks this idea is ridiculous and the two begin a bet over the matter.
5,Great outdoor chair!,"This chair is great for porches and decks, especially small ones because of the swivel action, you can angle it in any direction with no problem, and you can rock without hitting anything. It is very comfortable and attractive. The fabric looks like it will wear well. I've not had it long enough to tell for sure. I recently had back surgery and it doesn't hurt my back to sit in it. I bought 2 of them, and my wife also enjoys them."
5,Loving It!,"Quick delivery. Easy assembly. Very comfortable and seems to be holding up very well, and I keep it outside."
4,Hipster Horror,"I'm not going to analyze this film to death,(no pun intended), as that's already been done. I just wanted to point out a few things that I was struck by. First, this is an entertaining horror film. Not a slash-a-minute gorefest, but still with its' scary moments - and it holds the interest with the acting. I was not overly impressed with Rick Ottos' performance. It was O.K., but I thought it was a somewhat less believable version of Christian Bales' performance in American Psycho. Coincidence? Maybe. I was struck by the excellent cinematography, especially the exterior scenes, and by the SOUNDTRACK! No one has mentioned the soundtrack, but it was ultra-cool. It would be great to spin at your cocktail party, really lively and hip. Alas, no soundtrack CD available."
1,Don't waste your money,"Thank God for libraries. If I had paid money for this book I'd be returning it for a refund.As a hiking guide this book is a dismal failure. There are no maps of either road directions to the trailheads or of the hikes themselves. Driving and hiking directions are vague and contain several errors. Descriptions of the hikes seldom top 30 words and contain little useful or interesting information. I seriously doubt the authors have been on most of these hikes.Describing this as a hiking guide is dishonest. As a previous reviewer stated, it is a political manifesto. If you go for that sort of thing, you may like the book. If you're looking for a hiking book get one of the Falcon guides or one o the excellent books by William L. Sullivan (100 hikes in Eastern Oregon, 100 Hikes in the Central Oregon Cascades, 100 Hikes in Southern Oregon, etc.)."
1,even 1 star is to much for this piece of ...,"This book has nothing to do with Kimbanda/Quimbanda what so ever! It is a cheap rip-off! Robert Laremy might have been to Brazil, but this book is about cheap spells that are nowhere near Qiumbanda. Have a look at the page in this book where he praises himself to be chosen by some dubious Brazilian ""High Priest - who most likely doesn't even exist - to be the ""bearer of Good News and Quimbanda Prophet in the West"". Ridiculous!For anyone interested in the REAL Brazilian Kimbanda tradition, have a look at NA GIRA DO EXU by Mario dos Ventos."
1,Grabage,"This one stinks. Its a commercial spell booklet which claims to ""win"" the reader love, luck, success, and so on. This is just a marketing ploy to make the publisher money, nothing more. If you want a good book on Palo then check out THE BOOK ON PALO by Baba Raul."
4,I'm Sorry...,"I would like to apoligize for liking this song. Have I turned to the darkside (hopefully not)? I don't usually like anything this melodic , but I just ... love this song! It is so catchy! Good Charlotte is an ok band, but from what i've heard of them they are REALLY poppy. Kind of like New Found Glory, except not as good. This song, however is good. try the afformentioned MxPx and NFG, along with The Movielife and ska punkers Less Than Jake and The Aquabats (the aquabats rule!)."
5,Not Just Another One Hit Wonder Band,"This cd is very awesome. Take some punk flavor(Riot Girl), added with a lil hip hop(The Anthem), catchy lyrics(Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous), Melodic Voice(Emotionless), and some all around meaningful lyrics(Hold On, The Young And The Hopeless) and you've got a great album by a great band. Their first cd was awesome but there is no doubt that this one makes you want to play it until your cd player goes up in flames. Go buy this album, you won't be disappointed."
3,this song is ok but xpect better,"This song is a decent good charlotte song. it is gonna be all over the radio and mtv this fall. i hope the cd is a little bit harder then this song. there first cd (self titled) is awsome. i love the click,waldorfworldwide, i heard you, dont wanna stop etc. there new album ""the young and the hopeless"" comes out October 1st and i am definatly buying it as soon as it comes out but i would hold off on the single till then. hope this review was helpful.Caroline"
1,The most irritating and overrated band outthere,"I have no idea why people like this stuff, this isn't punk rock like the Ramones or alternative rock like Nirvana this is essentially a boy band that plays there own music, I The have lyrics that are probably written by a 12 year old, the Lifestyles song is such a hypocritical load. I hope Good Charlotte fails go to...to show your dissaproval of one of the worlds worst bands."
3,Not suitable if you're looking for a full coverage concealer,"This concealer has a nice creamy texture that is not too heavy. Best used with your fingers as the warmth of your fingers makes application easier. In general, this is a concealer that does not provide much coverage. So if you're looking to cover blemishes such as pimples or very dark under eye circles this concealer is not for you. I'm Asian, fair skinned with yellow undertones. I have very dark dark under eye circles of which I have yet to find a concealer to totally cover them. Using the yellow concealer alone, it does lighten my under eye circles but does not provide enough coverage. However, when I use the it together with my Bobbi Brown under eye creamy concealer, my dark circles are dramatically lightened though not totally concealed. I'm still on the look out for a concealer that can cover my dark circles completely."
4,A good job of summarizing Piaget,"A conceptual critique of six of Piaget's central, earlier works. Susan does a fine job of summarizing these works into this more accessable volume."
4,Very Nice Helmet,"This is my first bike helmet. I found it easy to adjust and comfortable to wear, but again I am not a super picky person and all I wanted was something to protect me in case of a fall or accident and at the same time I was looking for a helmet that was lightweight and cool to wear in this Florida heat. When riding I don't even realize I have it on. All in all, I would recommend it."
3,Sun-Cover Not shipped,"This seems to be a great helmet in terms of its price and design...But it does not gives you a very sporty look...especially if you have a round face or large head. Moreover, I was not shipped with the sun-cover which overall gives a very dull look to the helmet. But nevertheless, its light and sturdy, though I have been using it for past 5 months, it seems the upper plastic layer is detached from the foam inside and needs a re-glue. For the price, the helmet serves it purpose"
3,"Nice helmet, but maybe a little too expensive","This is a nice working helmet if you need one. It looks fine, fits comfortably and will do the job. I received mine in the wrong color then what I ordered. However, I would consider an off brand helmet that is guaranteed safe like a Bell. This helmet is more expensive then others because of the name brand, not because it is superior or anything special."
3,The Visor is useless,"This helmet misled me about certain aspects of its design with the picture that was posted. By the picture it appears that the visor of the helmet will come out at your eyebrow line so as to effectively block sun. This is false however, as the visor is actually placed 3 inches above the bottom rim of the helmet which not only looks aesthetically absurd, but does not block the sun at all. The visor was an important element of the helmet for me and having it come out at my hairline does not work.Otherwise the helmet fits well and is appropriately adjustable so if the visor and aesthetics are not important to you this helmet will work fine."
2,Too big,"This helmet is HUGE. I ordered this helmet for my gf, but it was too big for her. I have a pretty larger head than average but this was loose even for me. It doesnt have a dial fit in the back so you cant make it tighter than what the default size is, but it has elastic which will make it go a little larger if you have even bigger head.I dont know how the other reviewer got this fit on her/his daughter's head.I cant really comment on the helmet quality as I havent used it, but it looked pretty ok. I returned this helmet back to amazon. Maybe I should have measured my head before ordering!!"
3,"Good helmet, but not flashy or super comfortable","This is a very well-priced, decent all-around helmet that does what it is meant to. I don't find it particularly attractive, though. I also think it isn't the best fit on my head compared to some of the ridiculously expensive ones I've tried at bike shops."
2,ok,Bell Adrenaline Bike Helmet is a very stranger helmet because is very big look like a alien people when i wear
5,Had me on the edge of my seat!,"This book did not disappoint. The third in a trilogy, it was gripping, exciting, and taught me many Bible truths. The books are fast reading or maybe it's that I just couldn't put it down!"
5,Excellent Reading,This was the 3rd and final book in the series. It was excellent! All loose ends were wrapped up in fine fashion by the time the book ended. Bia Balaam becomes a real surprise; not to mention Decenti becoming a nut case. Following the Stepola family was fun.
4,Final in a series of three,"This ends the ""Soon"" series and although I enjoyed the series I would have liked to see more substance to the ending. Or maybe I was just disappointed that the series was over?"
5,Their BEST album ever!!!,"To all the voces fan's, this is a very awsome album. These guys really prove that they are the true pioneers of this kind of music. Every album is always better and difrent than the last one. They also have a website... so you can see what their about."
1,Not really anything to review.,"Well, I did not actually get the watch the movie becuase the player kept going in and out. After about 10-15 minutes, I got tired of waiting and just turned it off."
5,a great book for beggining herpers!,"if your just starting in the hobby of ""herping"" and you need info on selecting, housing, feeding, handling, snake bite, snakes of the world, natural history, and breeding you have found the perfact book! One quality i especially like about this book is the section on the 10 best snakes and the 10 worst ones. The photos are great!. I found this and exellant book to start my hobby in herping, and it can be used as an outline for even advanced ""herpers"" All and all it is a great book."
4,Arabic - an essential starting point,"This little book focuses on the Arabic alphabet and its different characters: isolated, initial, medial, and final. Although you may think the Arabic alphabet only has 28 characters, you will also have to learn 4 diacritical marks along with the 4 forms of writing - so 28 becomes something over 130 characters. The book does not come with a CD to work on pronunciation and this is a limiting factor."
4,Arabic Alphabet not so basic,"Awde and Samano's The Arabic Alphabet is a very good introduction to a complex language. I enjoyed the initial section, but became quickly discouraged with the language. This is not the fault of the authors. I think they succeeded in putting together a slim and accesible book. I hope to pick it up again soon."
4,Better for Calligraphy,"This book is distinct from Teach Yourself Beginner's Arabic Script (by John Mace) in a number of ways. On the one hand, it clearly shows proper letter formation for those who want their letters to be calligraphic. On the other hand, it presents little or nothing on ordinary Arabic handwriting per se, a negligible vocabulary, and essentially nothing on grammar. My recommendation is that the reader get both books. But, if the budget provides for only one book on Arabic, then Mace's book is probably to be preferred."
5,Start with this one!,"This book will really shorten the learning curve for learning the Arabic alphabet, especially if you are studying arabic on your own. The book takes a very intuitive progression through the letters. Once you've gotten reasonably comfortable with this book, I recommend hitting 'Your first 100 words in Arabic', by Wightwick. Between these two books, you should have a good fundamental grasp of the alphabet."
4,All you need now is a cassette...,"This is a straightforward description of reading and writing the Arabic script. If you have no experience with Arabic I think you would still need to locate a teacher or native speaker as some of the letters are very difficult to pronounce as native English speakers.However for the most part its easy to follow and would give you a great start, especially before you take an Arabic course.If it came with a cassette with pronouciation I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Great intro book,"Extremely user friendly introduction to the Arabic alphabet! It's easy to understand, and a gem to copy from. Overall, if given enough hard work and time, you should be more than proficient in the alphabet at the book's end!"
5,YOU CAN'T GO WRONG,"You can't go wrong buying this book - the basics in PLAIN ENGLISH, without the usual antiquated nonsense. To learn Arabic, you need more than one set of books. You need several! This one is the best value, and small enough to memorize.In my opinion, this book is to Arabic what ""Teach Yourself to Read Hebrew"" by EKS is to Hebrew."
5,Learned the basics in record time..Unbelievable results!,"Being an American Muslim, I am fascinated with the Arabic language, because it is the language that the the Holy Quran was revealed in. So it was important to me that I learn it, so I would not have to totally depend on the translations of others.I had tried several Arabic classes , but ususally, something would happen, for one reason or another, I couldn't finish the class, or the class would discontinue.Then I stumbled upon this book, and within a month I was reading and writing and working on my vocabulary and grammar. I learned in my spare time at my own pace, with excellent results.I highly recommend it."
2,I am sure it is fine,It was not what i wanted I was but I am sure its a fine book. I really wanted Egyptian arabic. also the book is difficult for me to self teach
3,The ArabicAlphabet: How to Read & Write It,"It is alright. The information in ""Arabic Grammar"" a reference guide by John Mace is much much better.""Arabic Practical Dictionary by N. Awde & K. Smith is seldom used by me. Many words are not available in the dictionary.Thanks."
3,Its not bad...,"I though there would be a bit moe to it, but its not bad either. Seems to be a book for people with a bit of knowledge of the language and not novice users."
5,Great Beginner Book,"This book is wonderful. Clear, thorough, and well written. I've tried other methods in the past and this is by far the most comprehensive book I've used. My advice, start with the alphabet and then move on to vocab and grammar. My only complaint is that it should come with a workbook!"
2,Balls broke too easily,"I purchased these balls for a hunting platform of my newly purchased Cat Power Tower. Although my kittens loved pushing them out of the openings and then chasing them around the bedroom, the balls lasted only a few days before they warped and needed to be thrown out. There is a piece of round plastic that is inside to make a noise but it did not hold the attention of the cats for long. More importantly, it could pose a choking hazard to your felines or to other pets or young children that may be present."
3,Cat toy,"When we first opened the package, our three cats really didn't play with them much. A week later they've all disappeared somewhere. Nobody seemed too excited about them."
5,FANTASTIC,"This CD is an excellent mix of of music - Deep In My Heart is a sure hit - Livin' (On Top Of The World) makes you want to reach for the stars - Never Look Back and Hold Your Hand are both excellent songs. There is a tremdous amount of talent with this band. They have matured with their song-writing - both in lyrics and the music. Absoultely worth your money! If you ever get a chance to see this band perform, they are fantastic entertainers too!"
1,ok if you aren't serious about biking,"I got this bike and used it for biking to school and back and forth from friend's houses and it was great. Over the summer I became actively involved in mountain biking and this bike failed to meet the standards I was looking for in a reliable mountain bike. The seat isn't well designed, the main frame becomes loose after too much hard riding, the shocks lock up, everything about the bike just breaks if you use it for mountain biking."
4,very good natural soap gets results,"it's very good, just lather it up and wait, tightens the pores, it works like a mask or you can just wash your face with itI wish they'd make it in a liquid version"
5,Poems of Classic Beauty,"Gorgeous poems about life in small villages in Palestine, the This book travels over everyday life, eating and farming, how the particular beauties of nature are savored. There are beautiful pictures of a grandfather and a mother. The wonderful story about the author's shoelessness is very touching. This book takes you to the heart of a world that, as an American reader, I knew wxisted but could not find my way to. I am so grateful for Taha for bringing me here."
5,"Affecting Poetry, the Grievous and the Buoyant","Taha's limpid and lyrical poems do what wondrous poetry always does. They deliver sensual plesure with their music and special sensibility--they tell us what it means to be alive, in particular ways, ""touch the herbs/the wild artichoke and chicory,"" and to grieve over our losses, again in particular ways: ""fatigue, hunger, vagrancy/debt..."" These poems embrace the land of Taha's origins, yet never veer into ideology or hatred. They glow with a love of what we are and what we must suffer. Bravo."
1,PROPAGANDA PASSING AS LITERATURE,"There may, in fact, be a book about the Palestinian Arab dilemma waiting to be written, but this treacly and biased pretense is not it. The Arab's hard turn in Palestine came as a result of an unrelenting war to extirpate all Jews from all of Palestine. If and when Arab writers really confront these facts they will properly blame their ""leaders"" instead of the habitual Israel bashing. Then some real poetry and literature may emerge instead of this amateur effort."
5,Perfect pie,"These pie dishes are perfect. I bought a total of eight, so everyone in my family could have their own individual pie. They are a bit big for that, and we often use one pie per two people. The dishes are heavy, brown the bottom crust evenly, and look beautiful."
2,FLMOM,"I ordered these for my Mother for Mother's day thinking she could use one of them to make a small pie for her and my Dad because a whole pie is too much for the two of them. I was very disappointed in the product due to the fact they say they are 5"" and there is nothing 5 inches about them.They are 4 1/2 and that is pushing it. I sent it back and was out a present for my Mom."
5,8th Wonder of the World?,"It's entirely possible that someone, somewhere, at some time, has created a recording of greater honesty, peace, and pure musical achievement than this one--I just haven't heard it yet.Gil is a musical prophet, statesman, and healer; I regard this record as one of the greatest artistic achievements of humankind.To know that a human being currently residing on the planet is capable of this is comforting and inspiring to me more than words could possibly convey."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"I bought this book through the [local store], so I was expecting a good read. I was so wrong. This book has no redeeming features whatever. It would be a teen book (and not fodder for the [local store]) if not for the explicit sex. It gives no clear picture of the university, supposedly a California Ivy. Eve, the heroine, is poorly drawn and not terribly sympathetic. She has no ambition other than to become head cheerleader and marry well. Kendra, her roommate, is a far more interesting character. There is no motivation for the Fata Morgana's choice of Eve for doom. Even the cheerleading tryouts (for a major university!) are a farce, as is the size of the squad. Do not waste your money on this book."
1,Not even a guilty pleasure,"I consider myself an equal opportunity horror reader. I'm not easily offended, and I'm not ashamed to sit back and enjoy a vapid, guilty pleasure of a horror novel which is what I thought I was getting with this book. Man, was I ever mistaken. First of all, people weren't kidding about the atrocious writing. It's cringe-worthy. The plot isn't even interesting--- I found myself stifling yawns and I skimmed through the last 3rd of it. Do yourselves a favor: save yourselves time and money and skip this. If you are looking for a supernatural story with gore and eroticism, try ""Flesh Gothic"" by Edward Lee."
4,A surprise,"I enjoyed this book, and I'm looking forward to reading the other two. The writing was good and easy to read. The desciptions vivid and the characters, even though the main one is a cheerleader, is very likable. Maybe the negative reviews posted here are because they have a thing against cheerleaders. I did too, in high school, but I'm a grown up now."
1,Nancy Drew + Charmed = Wasted Time and Money,"The naivete of the characters in this book reminded me of old series books for young readers Like Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys-- except when it comes to sexual matters, that is, of which they are well-versed. Plot is almost non-existent, characters are cartoonish, and the occult details (for all her supposed research) are sparse indeed. I read this in about two hours tops. I can't imagine a mature adult enjoying this. The other two in the series also get one star. MERILYNN has the same problems as the first novel, and SAMANTHA has a better plot, but is undermined by silliness and some glaring errors in basic grammar and/or spelling."
5,This was great!!!,"I read tons of books, but this book kept my interest so much it was hard to put down."
1,I wish I could rate this book zero stars,"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. At best, the story is shallow, the characters flat, and the entire feel of the book is fake.I have only very rarely thrown away a book, even if I didn't particularly care for it. But I took great pleasure in getting this trash out of my house."
4,Great Book!,"This book was suprisingly good! I really enjoyed it, I couldn't put the book down! It's great for anyone who loves a mystery combined with sexuality and sororities!"
3,Fun and cozy,"The atmosphere is light and fluffy, filled with cute humor and little mystery. The characters are simple but workable. Eve was an addicting beginning to a fun series that delivers what it hints at: pure, clean, all american fun and nothing more."
5,Awesome Pay-per-view,"Smackdown elimination match- Great action. Some eliminations happened too fast though. 4/5Molly Holly vs. Lita- average women's match 3/5Shane vs. Kane- One of my favorite matches of the night. A big brawl 5/5Tag Team Match- A match you see on smackdown. Worst of the night. 1/5Raw elimination match- Awesome. Better than Smackdown's. HBK put on one great fight. 5/5Undertaker vs. Vince- Blood, brutality....vince gets his ass whooped but wins in the end thanks to one of my favorite wrestlers kane 5/5Triple H vs. Goldberg- Not as good as Unforgiven. Goldberg destroys Evolution 4/5Great pay-per-view. You should watch it."
3,another half assed ppv by wwe,theres a good high fling opener by tajiri and jamie noble.then theres a smackdown survivor series match.its good but quick and half assed.lita vs molly sucks.youve got one beautiful sex pot going up against a total loser.both of these clueless chicks are blissfully unaware no one cares about thier athletic ability.then theres the best match of the night.its some sort of no rules match between shane o mac and kane.anytime you see shane o in a ppv you know big stuffs going to happen.hes got the record for the highest drop in a wrestling match in an offensive manner.then a stupid tag match and then a raw survivor series match.yep you guessed it!quick and half assed.the undertaker takes on vince mcmahon .taker beats him until the suprise ending.its really cool!the main event has bill goldberg killing triple h.its pretty cool to see triple h get trashed.
5,preety good,wow i gotta say this was a preety preety good survivor series the ambulance match now that was preety good.buried alive vince got killed in that match he was bleeding bad but vince won i thought taker was gone for good.triple h goldberg could of been longer but preety good decent match.ummm the raw survivor series match preety good when it turned bloody preety good 2nd in line was the smackdown match preety good eliminations went fast.overall this is definetely worth it 3rd best ppv in 2003 awesome go get it now peoples
5,Survivor Series,"I have ordered this event and man am I excited this is the best ppv of all time in my opinion,I mean wrestlemania X-7 was great but this will be off the hook!!! sure this may not have The Rock but its got Brock,HBK,Goldberg and Oton"
4,Very Good,MATCH 1 - Team Angle Vs Team Lesnar (elimination rules) - 8/10.A good choice for an opener.MATCH 2 - Womens Title - Molly Holly Vs Lita - 6/10.Not a bad match and i hate womens matches.MATCH 3 - AMBULANCE MATCH - Kane Vs Shane McMahon - 9/10.A very hardcore match which they fight all around the arena.MATCH 4 - Tag Titles - Bashams Vs Los Guerros - 7/10.A solid match.MATCH 5 - Team Biscoff Vs Team Austin (elimination rules) - 9/10.Match of the year candidate.MATCH 6 - BURIED ALIVE MATCH - Undertaker Vs Vince McMahon - 8/10.A very sick and brutal match. Vince bleeds a lot.MATCH 7 - WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE - Goldberg Vs Triple H - 8/10.Another good solid match.
2,shane and kane not as good as uniforgiven,shane vs kane hostipal matchwas good but not as good as their uniforgiven match it could have been better if another gimmick like a cage or 2/3 falls match was suggested as their match 6-/10
5,Awwwwwwsome.,"This is an awesome book. Worth the $.Paul D. MacLean, is my favorite neuroscientist. A man ahead of his time. His work is timeless, it is the seeds to the future understanding of the brain and the mind.Paul D. MacLean's work must be read by anyone who wants to enter the medical field.Read it, and stimulate your Neo-Cortex.:)"
1,Technically lame Unix bashing.,"Being a Unix SysAdmin, I was extremely disappointed with the haphazard handling of the technical details presented in this book. First, since when does the ""change"" time of a file reflect its last access? And since when did the /etc/fstab file have any security similarities to the .rhosts file? This book is riddled with technical mistakes, incorrect information and misinformed opinions. Don't waste your money unless you're an computer neophyte looking to be scared to death about the vulnerability of the Internet due to the pumice-like number of holes in Unix security."
2,"Lots of gravy, not enough meat","This book was overly dramatic and didn't have a point. As an exercise in investigative journalism, it might have passed the course. The research was probably pretty good, although not perfect, and the explanation of events was exciting, if overblown. As a book, however, it lacks a point. So this kid broke into computers...what should we as computer professionals do? So the internet is insecure...what should we as individuals do? So the FBI took too long to get up to speed on computer crime...what should we as voters do? None of these questions are answered, or even seriously addressed. Publishing this work in book form should have offered the two authors (journalists by trade) a forum to ask and answer the bigger questions instead of just stringing together a bunch of daily-news quality reporting. There is a sort of essay at the end of the book that makes a lame attempt to do this, but it's not worth buying the book for."
1,Worst piece of crap ever written about hacking,"This book is the worst piece of crap I have ever read. Same old sob story about the feds, etc. not taking computer crime seriously and being slow to get moving...blah, blah, blah....They figure out who the hacker is halfway through the book...so...no tension, no suspense, nothing....Save your money...come over to my house and steal my copy. I wont miss it one bit.The only shame is that I have to give it 1 star rather than NOTHING.....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,Author's should have double checked a few things...but okay,"This book was okay--but you have to wonder about the correctness of the facts when they make such glaring mistakes as referring to DOS as standing for Digital Operating System (it actually stands for Disk Operating System--see the Microsoft Museum Timeline, or any Cyber-dictionary for verification) (Note to David Cohen, another reviewer--it does NOT stand for Display Only System either!)Editors and the authors themselves could have confirmed this easily enough--makes you wonder what other ""facts"" didn't they check?"
5,Super cute,"This kit is really cute. It is really well done. From the little routine cards, to the pasties and glitter. It is packaged really well. I gave a couple of these away as bachelorette gifts-and people love them. The book is small and gives tips on dressing, attitude, make-up, and then describes the moves. Like I said this is cute, like for a gift or for fun, but if you are looking to be a pro or some in-depth kit this is not it."
3,Clorox 2 Ultra Color Safe Bleach 30.3 oz,"Clorox 2 Ultra Color Safe Bleach 30.3 oz (1.89 lb) 0.86 kgGuess my high expectations for this were misfounded--it did not take out the very recent coffee stain on my sheet. Clorax is a great brand, and they have terrific products, but this did not work at all the way it should have. I will revert back to my liquid bleach product from the local store, which works better."
4,Very impressive Italian Album,"I know personally,the singer of Madbones,he's a great guy and singer.Anyway...I really enjoyed them cd,even if I'm not really into punk music.I think is the best italian punk rock cd at the moment,perhaps you should try it."
3,Sable is hot,"La Resistance vs Dudley Boyz.(3/5)Okay match, nothing special. The Dudley 'table' gimmick is so past it.Undertaker vs AlbertTrash. Why does Taker bother? Is it because there is a shortage of superstars on Smackdown that stops him livin' it up on a beach in mexico in a deserved retirement.(3/5 - 2/5 for the match. 1 extra point for Sable, who looks hot, great bum)Shane O'Mac vs Bischoff.Intersting.(3/5)Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit vs Rhyno vs Tajiri.Very solid, but where is Cena?(4/5)Kurt Angle vs Brock Lesnar.-Incredible match. Maybe better than their match at Mania XIX(5/5)RVD vs KaneRob Van Dam sucks, and is nowadays a glorified jobber. Dull, lifeless match(2/5)HHH vs Randy Orton vs Jericho vs Goldberg vs Michael vs Nash.Goldberg looks (in this match) like the greatest wrestler of all time. Would've been a 5 star match but the ending is a joke.(4/5)"
4,"good, but worst summerslam since 1995!","summerslam 2003 was good. the fatal four way match was good. Brock lesnar vs. Kurt Angle was great. RVD vs. Kane was pretty good. The elimination chamber match was also very good, but it was nowhere near the first chamber match. Summerslam 2003 was very good, but not great."

3,looks great but wobbly,"The torches are just as attractive in person as they are in the picture. However, the metal posts arrive in three segments that have to be screwed in and several of them were not a perfect fit so they didn't screw in to the connecting piece all the way. they are still secure enough to use however in general they lean a bit because of the height and construction of the posts and the weight of the torch. overall would probably buy again for the price but be prepared to exchange one if the posts are defective."
4,Tiki torches,The torches are very pretty and burn nicely. The torch part is well made and looks like it will last for years. The only thing I did not like about them is the posts come in two pieces that you screw in to each other and they don't stay straight. The weight of the torch makes the top post lean at the joint where the two pieces are screwed together. My husband was able to make a one piece post for each of them and now they are perfect.
3,Was going to be a gift,It seem ok at first. The pole is very flimsy and doesn't screw together very well. It sways in the breeze. By the end of the year the pole broke.
