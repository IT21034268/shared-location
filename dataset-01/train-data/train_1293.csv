2,"No Experience Required, No Help Given","I purchased this book as I am somewhat new to the CAD system. I have used AutoSketch, the ""baby"" in the Autodesk family. This book did not help me one bit in understanding how to use the AutoCad software. I fooled around with it, and learned more (albeit only miniscule bits) by doing that than by using this book.It's a huge chunk of money for a book that does not do what it purports to do: support the beginnning user of the software.I am trying to learn this to upgrade users of AutoSketch to AutoCad, and am still in the dark. A HUGE disappointment."
3,Nonsense caméra,"Voilà un opéra délicieux, baroque et remarquablement mis en scène, bénéficiant de solistes efficaces et attachants......hélas, le spectacle que nous voyons sur écran n'est pas celui que les spectateurs ont pu apprécier dans la salle : la faute en est à une caméra qui ne privilégie que les gros-plans et néglige les vues d'ensemble. On a droit à tous les détails des visages, des costumes et des maquillages, sans oublier une manie détestable des mouvements tournants qui donnent le vertige, alors que la force de la représentation tenait à sa parfaite harmonie dans une architecture minutieuse et intelligente.Dommage, vraiment dommage..."
2,Terrible,The videographer should be shot! The camera work gives no sense of the staging/ action at all. It's terrible. The sound quality is poor as well. Don't bother buying it. What a travesty!
2,This is Alice. . .This is Alice on drugs. . .,"I give this two stars for the staging, costume design, masks and puppets of Nina Weitzner and Achim Freyer which were very inventive. But the rest of the mix resulted in an endless 123 minutes.You've heard of matter and anti-matter, Christ and the anti-Christ? Well, this is anti-music and anti-opera at its best, I mean, worst. Atonal music and screeching vocals. Everyone involved had to be on a drug trip and I think it's necessary to join them in order to enjoy it.I recommend you skip this one!"
2,Disappointing,"If you are vulnerable to motion sickness, please do not watch this. The camera work and editing are terrible. The music is interesting, as is the staging. I loved the bizzare costumes. But this video is simply unwatchable. I feel seasick. What a pity. I think this would have been great if the editing and camera work were not such a distraction.I sincerely hope this show comes to my city so that I can see and enjoy the show live. Minus zooming,swaying cameras and insane editing, I believe the show will get a great review from me."
1,Vibrator,"I purchased this item, however, i can't say how it works. When I received it didn't work and would have cost me more to send back. Very disappointed in wasting my money."
4,Not just for salads,"This is a very respectable balsamic vinegar at a good price. It is just sour enough, with a smooth sweet finish. I bought the 16 pack to include individual bottles in gift packages for friends, but I also find the 5-ounce size just right for the condiment tray I keep on my table. A few drops sprinkled into sauces, soups, vegetables, and other dishes adds flavor without fat or salt."
1,One of the worst I have read...,"I know I am going to get reemed for this, but I found this book to be absolute garbage. The characters possess predictable stereotypical personality traits and no sort of deph otherwise. The narration I found is about is intelligent as a sixth-grader. Overall, I truely feel that it wasn't the even the least bit entertaining.I think if this is your first book, you might find this to be your favorite up until you read another.If this is your favorate BDSM book, I cry for you.Try Uneven by Anah Crow. It will save you from gouging your eyes out with the cheese it's made of."
3,This game is not what you may think!,"You might be thinking, ROCKY, Cool! No, It is exciting at first, but after you past the rocky story mode it starts to get boring, and the game gets easier and easier as you play it more and more. From my opinion you should save your money for something that you need."
4,best game ever!!!,"This game is amazing. It has all the characters from all the rocky movies (up to number 6) including,Rocky, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, Tommy Gun, and the master of disaster, the king of sting, Apollo Creed. This game has amazing graphics and you can play story mode as 4 different characters. This game is amazing. This game is amazing but has some faults to it, like when you get knocked down the refs count very fast. And also you can't play as Tommy gun in story mode. Other than that this game is fantastic for all ages and rocky likers or not. Have fun and ""It ain't over 'till it's over""."
3,This is not what tou think it is!,"You might think by the cover of this game it would be COOL. No, this game is the type you get tired of after a while (3 weeks). The graphics are not very good and the characters do not have their natural voices, it is not worth buying and spending your money on. SAVE your money for something you need. Remember Jesus loves you!"
5,Love This Book!!!!,"Love the book, entirely too short, want more!!!! As I am adicted to this subject as it is the same year a distant relative migrated west and someday I hope to find their name mentioned in someones writings!!! This book gives me an idea of the life he lived headed west..."
5,Must have for Shoot-N-C targets,"Shoot-N-C targets are extremely useful for the shooting enthusiast. It allows you to see where you've hit the target without needing binoculars. The 1"" round targets cover your holes to allow you to use the main Shoot-N-C target over and over again. Great add-on product."
5,Home Run Derby,What an awesome nostalgic piece of baseball tv. I wish the series would have lasted longer. I bought all the ones they had to offer.
2,Doesn't fit all bikes!!!,The training handle was made of sturdy material and the grip felt good. Major issue is the clamp going on bike was too small! Could not fit around tube so bought Balance Buddy which connects to bolts on back tire. Worked great.
3,Unbelievable Good Deals and Great Adventures.........,"A nice compilation of deals available to all seniors, most already known if you have asked before buying or planning."
4,KP: The Anti-Princess,"I let my 5-year-old watch Kim Possible, because KP's one of the few strong role models for girls. The animated violence is usually kept to kung-fu style fighting (usually Kim v. Shego). The dialog is often clever and insightful, and it's good to see that the characters often have real world problems (like having your Mom and Dad along for a field trip). If you are a parent, try to catch KP on ABC (Saturday A.M.) to get an idea of what to expect."
1,Waiting for Season One,"I like this show, but I'm not buying an episode here, an episode there. C'mon Disney, release season one, wait a while, release season two... The Simpsons can do it, so how hard is that?"
3,Waiting for the Season collection,"Kim Possible was a fun, enjoyable show. And I'll gladly buy it--as soon as full-season collections are available.This ""single-DVD, 3 or 4 episodes"" routine is a waste of money that I can't support. Sorry, Disney: Until you release a FULL SEASON collection, you'll get nothing from me."
4,Brazen Virtue,"Nora Roberts is a first class writer, as with this book, she keeps you coming back for more. I recommend this book and the one before this, Sacred Sins."
3,Great Beginning...Disappointed Ending,"I truly love Nora Roberts and have read much of her work. Brazen Virtue starts off great with a chilling murder and a budding romance. The whole story goes well until the last two chapters where the sparks of the story abruptly fizzle. The killer's capture is completely anticlimactic especially since you're told early in the story who he is and what his ""political connections"" are. The only thing you don't know is his powerful father's name which doesn't mean anything anyway since I didn't learn much about him. The fear I hoped would be incorporated through Grace and Ed is dud. I know this was an early work for Ms. Roberts and thankfully her endings have gotten more thrilling."
1,Ripped Off,"I saw ""December 2010"" and ASSUMED this was a new book. I bought it, started reading it, and realized I read this years ago. I'm not happy I spent Kindle money on a book I read 20 years ago. This stinks!"
3,Not As Good As Sacred Sins,"I bought this book after reading Sacred Sins and enjoying it tremendously. Usually If there is a second book about the other characters in the first book, I have to read it. Brazen Virtue was good, but it was disappointing that Nora Roberts did not go deeper into Ed's character, as I find him quite a fascinating one. With his obsession with healthy food and books, he would have been a lot of fun to get to know better.The book ended too fast for me, as if Nora Roberts poured most of her creativity into Sacred Sins so that little was left for Brazen Virtue. All in all this was a good read, but Sacred Sins was more satisfying that Brazen Virtue"
2,Is these the complete series?,"I just got a Kindel for Christmas from my awesome hubby and am wanting to get started using it RIGHT NOW!!! Is these the complete series of this set? I am an avid Nora ROberts reader and have not read this, unbelievable I know! I can see only Sacred Sins and Brazen Virtues is this the complete set? If ayone can help would love to know, I like reading her series all at once."
3,"An enjoyable read and better than ""Sacred Sins,"" but not very moving","Much better thanSacred Sins; the characters actually talked and worked things out when they disagreed, and didn't hop right into bed together. I just felt there was more chemistry between the characters in this one, and less subplots detracting attention from the main characters. The plot was interesting and original, and it was just an enjoyable read overall. That being said, the reason I didn't rate it higher was that it just wasn't edge-of-you-seat suspense, nor a makes-your-heart-smile romance; it didn't engage my emotions the way I think a four or five-star book should. I recommend borrowing it, but I suppose it is an enjoyable-enough read to be worth buying if you must. However, for more bang-for-your buck and the best of Nora Roberts, I recommendBlue Smokeor the O'Hurley series (Born O'Hurley (The Last Honest Woman / Dance to the Piper)andO'Hurley's Return: Skin Deep\Without A Trace (The O'hurleys))."
4,Brazen Virtue deserves a gold metal,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! I went through it in about 4 days. This is the fourth Nora Roberts book I've read (the other ones were the Three Sisters Island Trilogy) and I've enjoyed them all! Lots of mystery, tons of suspense. Keeps you guessing and on your toes thinking and trying to figure out ""whodoneit""."
3,Disappointing sequel,"I read ""Sacred Sins"" a long time ago so when I saw this sequel, used, I picked it up. This book was ""just there"". The plot was standard, not anything unique.There was no chemistry between the male and female lead. When they had sex, two pages, there was no real passion involved. They were in fact polar opposites. Opposites attract but there were too many major issues that they didn't agree on. The only thing they had remotely in common is that she wrote fictional crime novels and he was a cop. She lived in an apartment in New York City, he lived in older neighborhood in a house he was restoring in DC. He was neat, she was messy. He was into healthy (boring) food, she was a junkaholic. She had a lot of money, he didn't. She smoked; he hated the smell of it. He liked mornings, she didn't. He was into exercising, she wasn't. It's hard to imagine this relationship working."
3,Good but too Short,"As a huge Nora Roberts fan, I was eager to read this sequel to ""Sacred Sins"" because that book was very good. I was very let down by this book. The story line dragged alot, it was very short and the characters underdeveloped. It is not for people who are sensitive to rape, either. I felt that Nora described the rapes with too much detail and it felt like she was trying to get the reader to sympathize with the rapist.As far as suggesting this read to others, it's a good book to read if you have nothing else to do or read."
4,Brazen Virtue,I am usually a happy ever after type of person but really enjoyed this book it had me waiting and wanting to know the end result
4,A different time,"In a time of today's tools of war it is hard to imagine the personal, up close, differences of trench warfare. This book was a reminder to me of how something so seemingly basic as comfortable shoes could present such a hurdle to a soldier's effectiveness. Weather, and constant troop movement, seems as much of an enemy as the Germans.I found the book a little confusing to follow and needed to reread it several times in order to feel comfortable with the content; but that's not all bad, either.Brad EoffPapillion, NEDecember 4, 2006"
2,"Too small to be useful, Overpriced","It's my own fault for not realizing just how small an 8"" vase is. Not really the right size for a decent boquet--a few short stemmed flowers maybe. But, nearly $40 for this little vase is ridiculous. The scarlet vase I ordered has a weathered look to it, too. Not nearly so vivid a red as that's in the picture."
2,little bang for your buck,"Vase is nice, smaller than it looks, not worth the money. would not buy this small of vase for the price."
3,Pretty nice vase for flowers...,"Pretty, but looks bigger than it really is. Actually it is a little small for the $$$. In the tradition of Fiestaware is made well, looks good and color is vibrant. The only complaint is the size."
3,"If you are changing axle shafts anyway, consider adding the tube seals","I was already removing my stock axle shafts to replace them with chromoly shafts, so this was not much extra work. I installed one side, and had to wait to install the other side because one of the tube seals was missing the retainer clip. Amazon got the replacement on the way quickly, and now both sides are on and working fine. I noted that the color of the first set I received was noticeably lighter in color than the second set. Once installed it doesn't really make a difference, since you cannot see both sides at the same time anyway."
3,A review of a really good book by Amanda Easton,"I thought that this book was a bit slow getting started but once you get passed that all the book gets very interesting. I really only wanted to read this book because I knew that Big Brother the television serise was based on this,but no I have relised what it is all actually about and the story behind it which isnt just another reality show.It was excellent the way that Orwell protrade Winston throughout the whole book and the use of all the other characers emphasised this greatly.I really enjoyed this book and just how Orwell protraded the future of the wrold in 1984."
4,Excellent!,"The Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery Disasters is EXCELLENT. Punk at its finest. The inclusion of the In God We Trust EP is good, but the tracks on it are a bit . . . unrefined. Although I still find them in my head from time to time. The DK helped lay the ground for today's modern punk artists. (And no, that doesn't include Blink 182 or any softcore emo bands.)"
4,a fine record made by a nice group of boys,"""Religious Vomit"" got me all excited when I first heard it 10 years ago. I just heard it again the other day -- and got all excited again."
2,Generic Hardcore With No Surprises,"When the jocks and cheerleaders at my high school finally got into ""Punk,"" it was this band. Slickly packaged, undemanding, and ""outrageous"", they filled a certain hipness niche. This album is particularly obvious. Minor Threat, Squirrel Bait, etc., flung themselves at rock with a juvenile heedlessness, but the DK's seemed to cautiously gather their forces and fine-tune their generic guitars to a laboratory approximation of discord.This record sounded catchy on first listen, and I liked the ""education"" on U.S. atrocities in Central America--something even the major newspapers of the time were ignoring. But very quickly it started to sound like my lawnmower crossing an endless patch of dandelions. ""Professionalism"" and Punk are NOT mutually exclusive. But things you cannot fake are sincerity, new ideas, and an infectuous excitement. Without these, all the provocative monikers, MRR sentiments and publicity stunts in the world can't help you."
2,out-dated,"This book needs to be up dated. The copy I recieved was written in 1997, and so much has changed on 95. I was really sorry I bought this book."
3,Ok album,"I like this one but its still is one of the more boring ones as well.Among my favorites are Rambozo the clown,One way ticket to pluto,and the classic Macho Insecurity. Ok release wouldn't by this first in their collection but still worth getting I guess."
3,"Good album, but not great like the first three albums","The ideas adressed in the songs on this album are great accompanied by good songwriting. However, the music is not nearly as good as it used to be. There really isn't the surf rock 'n' roll from hell music on this album that was included on the first three. ""Chickensh^t Conformist"" is a great song, but the only really flawless tune on this album. Worth a listen, not exactly worth ownership."
1,Musically Boring Novelty Record,"A band that has never sold out and did their own thing. Problem is who cares? 90% of Punk music is boring musically speaking and was quite dull when it first came out. This cd made me laugh a few times but I rarely play it. Kind of reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic album. I'm serious! Jello has a voice very similar to Weird Al. The lyrics to to this are very whiny and bitchy. Who wants to listen to some guy complain with that irritating nasal drawl? This band was good to see live as a sort of performance art set and it was interersting back then to see the wild, sometimes violent audience reaction to the music. Removed from that environment the music comes off very badly. Pretty well the most boring music imaginable, a genre based on a rigid refusal of new musical ideas. If you have to listen to Punk listen to Black Flag."
1,BAD,"this is the worst album ever by the dead kennedys. of all the albums ever by them this one is by far. DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED. BLAH im still pissed that i bought it, i was even told it wasent good but i didnt listen, dont make the same misteak i did. save your money and buy plastic surgery disasters"
3,"not the best, but still pretty good","there have been some reviews that just bash this last album, however it's not that bad. obviously, compared with their previous albums, this final CD does not do the dead kennedys justice. however, it still flows very well and it's enjoyable. this cd has a whole different feel than their previous ones. but then again ""fresh fruit"" has a different feel as well. for the first time listener, this CD should not be the one you start with, if you want their hits get ""give me convenience or give me death"" but i'd say ""plastic surgery"" gives the overall mix of the dead kennedys even if it's not usually a fan's favorite album since it does not contain ""california uber alles"" nor ""holiday in cambodia"", but that's what makes it unique. all their cds are unique however.in conclusion, this wasn't a bad last effort, there's better but this cd is still essential to the collector.definitely recommended."
5,A good one.,"This is a good DK album to have. It has a more ""commercial punk"" sound to it but dont panic, its not boring. There are some excellent Biafra lyrics on this one. The songs are once again poking fun at mainstream politics and social order(as always). Songs making fun of tourist, toys, music industry, cops, corporations, the president, and a commercial for ""USA for South Africa"" among many other things. A good one indeed!"
3,What happened?,"This was my first DKs album, and when I first got it I loved it to death. I played it so many times I thought I'd wear it down. But then I got the rest of the band's albums, and compared to them (I have to be blunt) this album sucks. As usual, Jello comes across as one of the greatest political lyricists since Phil Ochs -- I even cited ""Rambozo the Clown"" in a high-school term paper (I got a 98). But sadly, each song just pounds a single high-speed riff into the ground. I hate to say it, but it's boring. As a result, many people (like the Amazon.com reviewer) decide that the DKs had no musical originality. I suggest they check out _Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death_ for a look at this group in their incredible prime."
3,Good But Not What A Fan Expects From DK,"This album was good, but it doesn't live up the previous releases by the now-defunct Dead Kennedys.The sound is not even really the same and Jello's lyrics aren't up to the standard that he set in his earlier albums.Also, the great artwork (on the inside and outside of the album) that the fans of the Dead Kennedys had grown accustomed to is missing.It is too bad a great band had to make this their last album effort. It would even be an acceptable album, but not from the Dead Kennedys."
2,Missing something.,"I'm still a huge DK fan and originally bought this as an LP in 1987. I bought it on cd because I'm a completist. Try as I may, I hate Bedtime. The lyrics and playing are great, but it just doesn't stand up to the other releases. I wonder if the legal stuff and a contract resulted in a rushed album. I listened to it again a couple days ago with fresh ears and still hate it. The others (including the live one) are still great and relevant though. If you are new to DK and are wondering what to buy, get Fresh Fruit or Plastic Surgery Disasters- both are great examples of what DK were about. Avoid Bedtime though."
3,Not their best,"I'm a big DK fan and I was pretty let down by this album. Out of the 21 songs I only like a handful of them. (Although, Cesspools in Eden is one of my favorite DK songs). This album is more for the hardcore DK fans out there. I would suggest Give Me Convenience or Fresh Frut For Rotting Vegetables for someone who is looking to purchase their first DK album."
2,Really Fiesta?,"I have bought three of these ""cobalt"" flat bowls from the Warehouse, and I'm not sure they are really Fiesta. They are not marked on the bottom, and they could be Concentrix, which greatly resembles Fiesta, but isn't what I paid for or wanted. There's a real lack of quality control at the Warehouse.My error: I finally took these bowls out into bright noonday light and was just able to see the Fiesta logo on the bottom. The dark writing of the logo under the dark blue color of the bowl is almost impossible to see, but it is there."
1,Dangerous product beware:,"Search alli, then read the negative reviews on this product and you will see what I am saying. I bought it and threw it out once I started having symptoms"
4,WEIGHTLESS,"It's mind over matter. Alli helps me but, may cause side effects. Nothing drastic but, you sure know that you've taken it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"After doing all of the research and watching several infomercials, I decided it was time to see the product in action. What a disappointment! Followed this plan TO THE LETTER and never lost an ounce!"
1,Alli Linked to Colon Cancer,"I came accross an article that links Alli topre-cancerous lesions in the colons of mice.According to Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of PublicCitizen's Health Research Group, ""while it is notknown whether these pre-cancerous lesions will lead tocolon cancer, he and other cancer experts do notbelieve use of the weight-loss drug is a risk worthtaking."" I agree! I would rather find other ways tolose weight than risk my life taking Alli!"
1,orlistate hasn't worked for me,the first week I took Orlistate I HAD STOMACH GAS PAINS AND ONE TREATMENT DISCHARGE.tHE SECOND WEEK NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND I HAVE ACTUALLYV GAINED 5 POUNDS WITH NO SIDE AFFECTS. THUMBS DOWN TO ORLISTATE.
3,quick results...no- but with time this works,"I have been using Orlistat ( Alli) for several weeks and while it is not a quick fix, it does assist in weight loss. The directions are adamant saying it takes work on your part and a low fat , decreased calorie diet along with exercise. There is no magic trick to lose weight . It is work and commitment. I lost 5 lbs in the first 8 days of use. Side effects will take place if too much fat is consumed. It is all outlined clearly in the directions. I like this product. Thumbs up to Alli for me. Glad it is available OTC now and not just by prescription."
1,Be prepared to buy a new wardrobe if you take Alli,"I tried it for a month. Because it was approved by the FDA I felt safe trying it. The side effects are awful. My hiking was put on hold for a month because I couldn't stray too far from a bathroom. This product gives you gas but not just gas - a disgusting oily, yellow discharge also. You know that feeling you have when your body is telling you it needs to get rid of solid waste, well you start losing your ability to control these muscles, and are lucky if you make it to the bathroom on time. I lost 3 lbs in three weeks (1 lb./week) which is not bad but then I gained the 3 lbs back and an additional 2lbs. Can't understand it because I am watching what I eat. This product causes too much distress in your body so be warned before trying it. It seems my grandmother was right. Just exercise and the weight will come off. Ah, excuse me, I have to run to the bathroom again. Arrgh!"
3,Belt and Pistol,"Pistol was awesome. Looks great, has fun sounds, and is a must needed prop. The belt was cheap and shiny plastic and needed some altering to fit and to look more realistic. Worth the price just for the pistol, though!"
3,80's Made for TV look and feel,"The basic premis of the plot, and you can get this from the back of the box, is that a fed-up LA family man moves his family to Oregon upon the prompting of his neighbor. The movie has that fuzzy look to it, like old documentary film, which make it seem right out of the 70's. I found it funny at times, although a bit contrived. I would watch it again."
1,sizes are wrong!,"The sizing on this product is completely wrong! I went by the size chart to order tights for my four year old, but upon recieving them, they are big enough to fit an adult. What a waste of money, although the tights were cheap, the shipping cost the same as the tights, so it's not even worth returning them and investing another dime in them."
4,They really do run very BIG!,"They're good quality, but my daughter won't be wearing them for a couple of years. I read some reviews that they ran big, but my daughter is a tall three year old so I thought I'd get the size 4-6. Wow!!! Huge!!! She won't even be able to wear them when she's 4, maybe when she's 5 or 6."
1,wouldn't buy again!,"I ordered mine in Navy blue, they looked great coming from the package, but after a day of wearing - they peeled so badly that I had to ""shave"" the pills off. They even looked nastier after I washed them for the first time. Well, I guess the reason for that is that the contents of the tights is primarily Acrylic, and Nylon, and not ""a dash"" of cotton. Had I known the contents - I would have never bought them. I hope they will last for a little longer (while it's still cold) and I'm tossing them..Size was a bit off, but almost fine, so no complains there. Sorry people, but I like to be honest, so You have an option."
2,Don't like texture,This is a very weird and hard to work with texture. I also did not notice any great wound healing either.
3,healing gel,I think this product helped to heal my wound more rapidly than it would have healed without it.
2,fluff,"I picked up this book while browzing for something to read while waiting for Nora Robert's newest to be released. I found the story lines to be weak and the characters' behaviors not believable or realistic. It is a light, fluffy read, but following on the coattails of Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown, not particularly spell binding. I'll stick with Nora!"
4,Air tank for many use,"I removed the tire chuck and installed an air pipe extension and a quick disconnect at the end. Now it is used for filling tire, air blower, and occasional hobby air for operating air brushes. The most annoying problem is the paint. It painted with lead paint so I am required to wash my hand after use or wear gloves. I am planning on wrapping the handle with a duct tape so I don't have to touch it to move it around. The tank is welded well and feel safe. But the welding job at the handle and the leg isn't up to my standard. Over all I am pleased with the purchase."
4,Three Good Episodes,"I agree that the Fresh Beat Band thing is a bummer on this DVD but it still does contain 3 really good episodes: For the Love of Socks, Escape from the Tower and Los Galactigos. All three are cute stories with catchy songs--don't let the negative reviews sway you into believing the episodes on this DVD are lackluster."
3,"Leave the Fresh Beats out of The Backyardigans, Please.","We pre-ordered this DVD for my daughter, who is 15 months old and loves the Backyardigans. My husband and I also love the show, so all three of us were bitterly disappointed when there was an episode of The Fresh Beat Band stuck on as a dubious ""bonus"" rather than including the usual 4th episode of the Backyardigans. Considering we all detest those Fresh Beats, we would probably not have purchased the DVD if it had not been a pre-order and we had seen the episode list before we had paid for it. Honestly, the first time we played the DVD, my daughter started crying when the Fresh Beats theme song came on.As for the actual Backyardigans episodes, they are a lot of fun. If it weren't for the Fresh Beats being tacked on as an afterthought, this could have been one of the better 4th season DVDs."
2,Seriously? I'm missing an episode,"All of the backyardigans DVDs have four episodes, unless they have one that is a double length feature... and this one doesn't. They should sell this one at 75% what the other DVDs sell for, because that's what you're getting -- 25% less episodes for the same price."
1,Love Yards but this dvd stinks!,"My daughter has all the Backyardigans dvds and they are great. They all come with 4 episodes on them, but for some reason this one comes with three and an episode of some other show. Guess they threw this together for the money and to get it out quick. But anyways she gets so mad when the forth episode comes on and it is not theBackyardigans. So I have to stop it and restart the dvd. All the others play through the 4 episodes and start over. If your just getting in to them get a different dvd."
5,Excellent Resource!,I love this dictionary! I started studying Russian 13 years ago. This dictionary has stuff that I've never been able to find in regular dictionaries. I should have bought this years ago!
5,Poetry of Passion,"In many poetry collections of the past decade, the overwhelming mood in these books has been a languid despair bordering on nihilistic obsession. Opal Palmer Adisa's, Caribbean Passion, defies this trend. Indeed, the emotion that shapes every syllable in this collection is a fervent love that celebrates its expansiveness. Throughout the four movements of Caribbean Passion: Mento Ska, Reggae, and Dancehall what emerges is a portrait of a woman and poet who is unabashedly erotic and boldly passionate about her home, life, and culture. And at a time when some Caribbean poets, artists, and intellectuals may be tempted to turn away from the Caribbean and its landscape as a proper subject of artistic or intellectual meditation, Adisa's poems pull our attention back to where it rightly belongs: our homelands in this archipelago of islands."
5,Moon And Stars,This Book was awsome! I loved it especily because next year for school I have to do a prodject on Racizim And Rights and this book had a lot of people looking down upon women. (I can't think of abetter way to phase that!)
3,OK story,"A good book but to much foutune telling. To me this isn't a favorite, but not a least, it's just as I rated, ok. To older readers I reccomend it as a 2nd. To younger readers a 5th. It IS a good story, not boring."
4,Good read,"This book started out slow. I was afraid I wouldn't get interested in it and considered switching to Mary, Queen of Scots. But I'm glad I stuck with it. There are a few things that struck me. She always talks about puting things (notes, rice, ect) in her Grandmother (immortilzed in some kind of jar) but never takes anything out. I wish it had been explained. Do the leave it in for a day? A week? Does it disapper? Does the Jar ever get full? And the feasts to the Gods, who eats that food? Does it go to waste? I think from one part of the book they (the people) eat it but I wish it had been explained better. For someone who isn't Korean and not familair with the traditions it leaves a few questions. BUT I loved the relationships her boy friend, her sisters, her mother all of them are heartbreaking! A very good story over all."
5,Fabulous Resource,This book is a fabulous resource for anyone involved in organization training. The authors have delineated the process by which training becomes real learning and provide scads of creative activities and materials for the trainer to use. It can become the most-used book in a trainer's library.
1,not delivered as promised,I ordered this book on 2nd February and as at 19th March have still not received this book. This sort of action or inaction is unacceptable on any commercial website. The seller has no links where one can contact them and this is after payment has been made in full.
4,Enjoyable,This is the second Amanda Hazard book I have read and I enjoyed it just as much as Dead in the Melon Patch. My only regret is that I didn't find this author before her other books went out of print. I'm looking forward to her newest which is due out soon.
2,"Very disappointed, Not up to the previous 4 books","This book was a great disappointment. The author has taken the main character, Amanda, and changed her out of character from the other 4 books. I felt cheated in this book. In the other 4 books, I laughed out loud in many parts, with this book I did not laugh. It was like reading a soap opera. The previous 4 books I could not put down, this book was hard to finish. Even the ending was a disappointment. In the other 4, the endings were wonderful, this one was just frustration. I hope in the next book, the author puts Amanda back in character and with Thorn."
2,SIgma 28-70mm,"I ran the 28-70 2.8 through the paces and it's off to SIGMA for calabration after one day. I read many reports of focus issues from 2.8 through about 4.5. I rolled the dice and lost. The autofocus missed on 99% of the shots running up to about f 4.5. From f4.5 through f-11 the images improved as expected. The build seems very good, just a calibration in my case ( I hope ). I will let you know with an update once the lense comes back from service. Now I do believe this lens will perfrom if the calibration works, because my f7 shots looked great for a lens at this price. The lense did overexpose about 1/3 stop, but it was easily fixed. This was my first Sigma and I am going to give it a chance and re-review once it gets back, just seems the quality control issue people have with this lens is true."
4,Tasty bites of energy,"I couldn't do without these to keep my energy going and stave off hunger during long runs. I have tried both the fruit punch and multi-flavor packets, and found the fruit punch to be delicious, but some of the flavors in the multi were slightly unpleasant; I wish I could tell you which ones they were. Beans are less messy and much easier to eat while running than gels or shot blocks, as you can breathe more easily with a small bean in your mouth than the other items, which are thicker and harder to swallow. One packet fits into the zipper pouch ofFuelbelt Sprint 10-ounce Palm Holder with Pocket, which I also love for longer runs. My advice would be to find a store that sells these beans in individual packets, and try a few different flavors before buying a bulk box."
3,book of the dead,Smaller book than I thought. Will probably get the full version. Would not recommend if you're looking for a good read.
4,Small But No Extras,"We accidentally ordered this book not realizing it was a pocket edition.We ended up returning it because it did not include the glossary, pronounciation guide, etc. of the full-sized version (which we had to order directly from the publisher as it wasn't available here at Amazon.)If you're looking for a pocket edition, though, it's just fine."
5,Very sexy!!,"My man loved this one (""Flutter Butt Crotchless Panty"" in red from LoveFifi Lingerie) and I feel very sexy when wearing them. These panties go best with ""Portrait Open Tip Bra"" in red from LoveFifi. When we go out, it's a turn on to know that HE knows what's under my clothing. They are made very well and will last for a long time....in other words, thay are not made from flimsy fabric. I bought several things from LoveFifi Lingerie and I love them ALL...very, very sexy and well made. They will last a long time. I will be purchasing from them again."
2,Cute but not practical,"They flaps overlap like you would not believe and they get in the way. While they are cute and great for a fun time with my spouse, they aren't something I would recommend you buying unless you want to fight with it constantly."
2,Too Many Mistakes & Too Many Unstated Assumptions,"The mistakes, inconsistencies, and assumptions are frustrating. I don't know if there is anything better on the market. If so, I wish I had it right now."
3,"Good book, but has lots of mistakes.","More concise than the Lindeburg review book, but with more mistakes. Pays three dollars per substantial mistake sent by mail. I figure that's worth the price of the book."
3,Continue to be impressed,"I continue to be impressed with Ms. Bradley's style of writing but this is not the best read. The first one I read by her was ""One Night With A Spy"" which was absolutely THE best. The Spy continues after The Pretender in The Liars' Club series. Thought the male lead was a bit slow not to figure out what was going on in his house. I saw him finding out the secret differently though."
3,Would have been great but...,"I was appalled by the scene in the study where James was sleeping soundly,drunk, and Phillipa decided to touch him all over, intimately, against his knowledge. Wasn't that a bit like molesting someone? They didn't even know each other that well! The author did the same thing with Willa and Nathanial in their story, only a few days after they'd met, though Willa didn't go as far as Phillipa. But she did peak down his night shirt while he was sleeping to get an intimate look at him. Kind of weird to me. I don't know of any woman who would want a man to do that!And aren't these guys supposed to be spies? Shouldn't a spy be more alert? James was drunk, so I can understand why he did not awaken while being molested, but Nathanial was merely sleeping and he didn't know Willa was touching his chest and shirt?"
4,Best of the three,"I liked this book.... Its the best of the three in this series so far. I loved how Ms Bradley, made the character, Philippa Atwater, pretend to be a man. Was a fun read. James Cunnington is just right in romance, and the son he adopts Robbie makes the story flow nice.I think Celeste Bradley, is a wonderful writer. I love the spy, romance themes of her books. They are all worth reading..this one especially. The only reason it gets only 4 stars, is they don't hold me long...they all take me a while to read, not the kind of books that make me not eat...not clean the house...not sleep ..wanna play hooky...5 star kind of books. But they are all worth a peek. Not keepers... but getting there."
3,Very disappointing.,"This was an ok read but nothing special. The cutest thing was the street savvy little boy, robbie and his relationship with phillipa. I couldn't believe that our hero, master spy, James couldn't tell that Phillip was a woman.... He needs a career change. Even the dialogue wasn't all that interesting. I had to stretch to give it 3 stars.........."
2,Flamenco 'light',I have 130 new flamenco CD's from about 30 artists and I can say Nocy is a real light-weight that gives new definition to the 'flamenco light' term. It might be nice to listen to in an elevator though...
5,Worth the Expense.,"Our grandson suffers from asthma, which is easily triggered.Using this product has diminished his asthma flair-ups by 80%+.He now breathes easy, and so do we.Expensive, but worth the money in savings from less ER trips.Easy to apply.Cats-Dogs-Dust-Older House? - Buy Allersearch, it is a no miss purchase."
4,Helps for your dog's allergies too,"This product can also be used for your pet's allergies! My dog has extreme allergies and we noticed a difference with her itchy skin for a month after we sprayed the carpets down with this product. Now that the month is up, she's suddenly back to extreme itchiness. So, we are definitely going to add this to our dog's ongoing allergy treatment. Definitely helps - not a cure - but makes a difference.One downside: The sprayer didn't work on the bottle, so beware of that... You may need to buy an all-purpose spray bottle for application."
3,It is hard to say if it does anything but no bad oddors or stains,It is hard to say if it does anything but no bad oddors or stains
2,Not sure there is true science to back this product,"My eyes hurt so badly at the time that I would have tried anything! I have dry eyes, etc...and thought I must have mites as well that were causing me problems. Anyway, I later went through allergy testing (like everyone else in Houston!)...and the Allergist said she didn't think using these types of products causes any harm...but there is no science to back the hype. I agreed with her."
5,Hurt Scores A Hit,"One of our nation's most cherished veteran sportswriters does a masterful job mixing fact and fantasy in ""Return of the Football Fossils"". Bob Hurt incorporates a lifetime of covering sports with a creative imagination and produces a work that is both humorous and informative. To be sure, it is ahead of its time with several solutions for problems that still plague big-time college athletics. Today's college athletics adiministrators would do themselves a favor by considering a host of Hurt's proposals. Nevertheless, it's a refreshing look at the lighter side of college football. In another time, this might have happened..."
4,A library of Information in one book,"I didn't give this book 5 stars because it has one fault. It's price!! But save up and buy it because it has the most comprehensive information in one package. It gives even the beginner a flying start in the art of dyeing. lin Noble tells you about how to use resists and fiber-reactive dyes; how to marble and how to use direct application dyeing, immersion dyeing,and paints to use on textiles. She includes the recipies for each project and a lot of background information that build you knowledge not just ""parroting"" styles. Once you have read this book, you have the foundations to move beyond the basics and develope your own ideas. There are resources in the back for the people in the US but not much use for those of us from overseas.Excellent and a must for any fabric artist's bookshelf"
3,Pricey but worth it,"I was at first weary to buy this book because of the high price. After debating the topic numerous times I just went for it. Now I am ever so greatful that I have bought this book, it is very thorough and displays many important bits of information. So for all those looking at the book but hesitant of the price just go for it! You won't regret it."
5,Love this book!,"This book contains a lot of great info. But my purpose in buying it was to get the dye recipes for making fabric gradations. You just can't buy them anywhere! I need them for my quilts, so I bought this terrific book. It was well worth it!"
1,Beware priced too high!,Looks like you are getting more than you really get ........ If you shop around you will find this stuff a whole lot cheaper.
1,Way too small to fit on a cruiser.,"This is way too small to fit on a cruiser, it arrived today and working on installing it right now. The back brake's caliper ""legs"" are too short to reach the rim, only reaching down to the sidewall of the tyre on a 26"" cruiser. The diameter of the calipers only just reaches around the standard size splash guard, but it doesn't have enough room to close the calipers."
3,front a rear brake kit for cruizer bikes,"this kit has cheap brake pads and you will need to modify your fenders. i had to clip away some metal on my fenders to allow the brake arms to close all the way. but after about 3 hours of work i got them on and I'am happy. the kit also was missing a small brake line cap. but no big deal. cheap handles too. one is a little bit messed up. the large pin isnt lined up, but im sure i can fix it. wont matter. cuz i got a new doubler brake comin soon"
2,The wrong drummer,"Too often the drummer works against Grappelli's fluid sense of swing and drags the group into a ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"" groove. Still, it's Steph and Vassar, so one bright shining star for each of the masters."
2,Kaffir Boy,"This ""study guide"" is NOT what I was looking for! From the prodcut description, there was suppose to be study questions for the reader of the book. There were none."
4,I gotta find me one......,"This book had everything you could want in a good book. It had the cinderella story, opposites attract, a little intrigue, a lot of laughter and an excellent and entertaining read. This is the book to read if you need to add a little fun to your life."
5,I Loved It!!!,"This was a fast paced book, which I love to read. Patti Berg did it again. The relationship between Jack and Sam was truly wonderful. Sam was only looking for a place to belong, aren't we all looking for that. I highly recommend it."
3,A light cowboy romp...,"My first Berg novel. Samantha, the homeless, in-debt to a loan shark, outspoken, living in her VW bug title character is a hoot. The romance and wooing scenes could have been more spicy."
2,Fiancee for a while,"Maybe I expected too much. Somehow everything fell a little short. The heroine is sweet, hard-working, and well-intentioned but not too smart, and the hero is kind of flat. He's rich, of course, and I gather he's nice for a rich man. Several secondary characters were quite annoying, especially the manager-cum-minister who preached at every opportunity, and the needy, demanding sister who never took no for an answer. Jack and Sam fall in love instantly, knowing nothing about each other. Such quick and superficial relationships leave me cold but probably would appeal to fans of the ""Pretty Woman"" school of romance: Jack is so free with his money that he doesn't mind spending 320$ for a cute bra & panties set. He'll even buy her four! Wow, not."
5,Best conditioner I've ever used,"The only conditioner I'll use. My hair has never been stronger or silkier. If I could buy this by the case, I would!"
4,Good Natural Conditioner,"This is a good natural conditioner. I find that it is best to use when your hair is soaking wet (don't towel dry your hair). The conditioner is (well seems to me) to be concentrated and works best to detangle the hair when some water is add to it. It will start to foam and that's when you get the best ""SLIP"". Most REAL natural conditioners don't have slip but this one has a bit which is very helpful as I have afro-coiled hair. As far as the way it makes my hair feel I like it but I really need to use the product some more to see if I notice any changes or benefits. I have only used it once. I definitely want to order the deep conditioner from soignee as well.Real natural conditioners are hard to come by, and soignee has done a good job at creating a TRUE naural conditioner without synthetic emulsifiers.Also the bottle is green, not the color in the picture."
5,A very naughty but very funny book.,"Although this book is now quite old it has lost none of it's ascerbic wit. And it is wit with a dark, naughty and twisted edge which does not have to work hard to illustrate it's point, it does exactly what you would expect of the title and why would you look if you felt as though you would be offended?I believe this kind of base, juvenille humour is needed by us all at time's. The hilarity of the forbidden and taboo subject is intensely and achingly funny sometimes. Surely everyone remembers wanting to howl with laughter when being heftily scalded as a child?To ignore we have such base instincts is to deny being human and assume superiorty over ones peers, quite hilarious in itself really, it is afterall, JUST A BOOK!This book is wickedly funny and a huge ""pick-me-up"" with no real malice intended! To the book's detractors and disapprovers I say, Lighten up folks! NO ACTUAL CATS WERE HURT IN THE MAKING OF THE BOOK!!"
5,"funny,funny,funny book!","i once thought cats were worthless,not anymore! i was astounded at the many uses the author found for them! funny read!"
1,"Poor taste, waste of money",Too many animals are being dis-respected and abused. This book is in bad taste and is offensive to me as a long time animal lover and rescue volunteer.Parodys are funny - this is just in poor taste and offensive.
1,Awful enough to make even dark humor fans disgusted,"This is so sick and disgusting that not even a die-hard fan of dark humor would give this another look.This book is page after page after page of sick humor that would even turn animal haters into animal lovers.The author did'nt stop to think how this would affect people-he/she just went ahead and got this sick book published.This book is as sick and disturbing as jokes about using the body of someone's child or infant for various things.Don't waste your money on this disgusting book-if you want humour,I suggest renting Groucho Marx or Bill Cosby videos."
1,"Funny, but mean!",I really love cats. I read the book. It is funny. But it was mean! Don't let kids read it!
1,This book is a disgrace to all animal lovers.,"I would have given this waste of good paper no stars. How about 101 uses for a dead author, Simon Bond."
1,Great for making a good fire!,"I honestly can't see any other use for this book...I do have a good sense of humor but I don't support in any way a book that promotes such cruelty to a living being. Simply put, this book is not funny, it's just sick. Don't recomend it at all, in fact, I wouldn't even give it one star!"
3,Fun for all,"I had this book when I was a child, but last year I bought it for a friend for her birthday (20 years old). With me being a dog lover and her a cat lover, I was surprised at how much we both enjoyed it. This is a book that would be fun for most ages."
5,Use # 102: Salutary Lesson.,"Mother points dramatically to a thoroughly flattened cat lying on the roadway. ""Look at that!"" she exclaims to her four-year old child. ""THAT cat crossed the road without asking its mother first!!"" Child bursts into a torrent of tears (and never again crosses a road without first asking mother.)"
5,Cats cats cats,"Great book, funny idea. I don't like a drawning style, but anyway is great.Cat lover."
1,Cheap table tennis balls. Cheap.,"Yes, they're cheap. I like the price. But...You don't have to be very good at table tennis to be disappointed with the quality of these. The seam is noticeably thicker material, and when it bounces on a seam, it has a dull sound and the ball doesn't bounce as high or as predictably.In short, these balls make you feel like you're playing with crappy equipment. I hate to say it because decent balls SHOULD be this inexpensive, but these are probably not the balls you are looking for.It's probably not a surprise that the manufacturer themselves describe these as 'one star'. They do make equipment they call 'five star', so take that into consideration. I suspect (but don't know for sure) that the 'three star' balls are probably the fair compromise."
1,Don't waste your money,"As a teacher who has taken her students to swim with the manatees for over ten years and one who is always on the look out for a good educational video on the manatee, I was terribly upset. The DVD of poor quality and the storyline was horrible."
3,a kids review,Judy Moody Declares Independence is about Judy Moody going to Boston with her family and while she is learning about the Boston Tea Party she meets a girl named Tori who's from England. Tori has her own washcloth and her own phone. Judy also wants to have her own washcloth and her own phone too. She also learned about the Freedom Trail and Paul Revere.I could relate to Judy's character because she wanted a sleepover with Tori but her mom wouldn't let her.I like the book because it's funny. My favorite part of the book is when Judy's chasing after the bus because her brother was still on it.I would recommend this book to a person who likes Judy Moody and to a person who likes to learn about the Boston Tea Party.
1,Not as desribed and therefore way over priced!,"As a few other reviews stated, the shipment of the ""Bissell Filter Kit Style 9"" which I received, only included the pleated circular filter and the foam circular outer filter. From a review of both the Amazon description and the merchant's (Go Vacuum) the ""kit"" should have included four filters not two.[...]The package I received does not include the pre-motor filter or the HEPA exhaust filter.A bit dissappointing as the price I paid is more twice that of the filter set up that i received."
5,"Good product, saved me some $$$","I had my Bissell upright canister vac for about a year when I went to go and wash out the filters. The primary foam filter just dissolved in my hand. I can't really complain considering the amount of use I got out of it. Still, I'm hoping the replacement parts last a little longer.The new filters work great so far. Saved me the price of a new vacuum. They also do a much better job of keeping dust from being pumped back into your home's air than a bagged vacuum. Just remember to check them every few times you vacuum and rinse them out when needed."
1,Master Visual Quick Books 2005,It would be easier to rate if after you advised me the back order I'd placed on this book was now going to be shipped -- was shipped. I still haven't received it. Sandy Wilson
1,SATISFACTION: THE WORST SONG EVER,"Now this is another really bad song by BOSTONS MORE THAN A FEELING, QUEEN'S WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, AND STEVE MILLER'S THE JOKER....SATISFACTION. IT SUCKS. STAY AWAY FROM ALL THE ROLLING STONES."
5,Feeling their oats,A great batch of hard rock featuring several self-penned tunes by the guys along with their usual brilliant covers. Spider and the Fly is flawless.
4,"Mike Godsdog, almighty!","The Review, This is a really good old Stones album. I had it back in the 60's and I enjoy it today, it's worth the price. Mick plays more harmonica than usual on this paticular album and the songs are very, very good. I like all the songs on this, but inparticular, West Coast Promotion Man, The Spider and the Fly, and One More Try. Satisfaction was their big hit from this album, but if I was to vote the least favorite song on this one, it would be Hitch Hike, but I don't skip it when I'm listening to it. Micks harp playing is great and I think any rocker will enjoy this classic music. Thankyou kindly, Mike GODSDOG, almighty!"
5,It Takes Me Back ...,"New Year's Eve: 1965. A small apartment with a lot of people and this ""album"" on the ""stereo."" Oh what a night!LOVE Spider and Fly. And every other song on there."
1,the track listing here is incorrect,don't buy this album. it doesn't have the listed tracks. its no different from the non dsd uk version of the album.
3,Not As Good As 12X5,"Buy 12X5 and Now! before this. Even though it has Satisfaction, it is not as enegetic and the boys sound tired."
1,another stones SACD ripoff,"Yeah, the music is great. Blah blah blah. We all know the music is great. But seriously, what's up with this SACD junk? I'm not gonna pay $20 CDN for a hybrid-SACD. And I don't have a SACD player and refuse to get one. I really don't think the sound quality is gonna be what they market it to be. It's definitely not going to be that good that it covers the ridiculous price that they charge. If they're gonna remaster it like this, at least keep on printing the originals so they're affordable (kinda like with the Bob Dylan catalogue). And if you're gonna remaster it and charge this high a price, AT LEAST PUT SOME BONUS MATERIAL IN THERE."
4,Satisfying,"For ""Satisfaction"" alone this is an important album. What brings it to an upper echelon is the hauntingly menacing ""Play With Fire."" The other ten tracks pale in comparison to these two. While ""Satisfaction"" is a track with few surprises left for most listeners (although after several close listens I was surprised at just how intelligent the lyrics were, as opposed to the expected anthem about sex), ""Play With Fire"" will be a new experience for many listeners. The other very pleasant surprise is the Sam Cooke cover ""Good Times."" This track gives Mick a chance to sing a bit more soulful than is his wont, and he pulls it off famously. Some of the tracks (""Mercy Mercy"" and ""Hitch Hike"") are enjoyable but obvious filler. By and large, however, this very early Stones album shows them on the cusp of becoming the tour de force of the later 60s and 70s."
3,So just how white was his shirt?,"The Stones' pre 1967 US albums are all inferior in conception, track listing and sound to the original UK issues, which the band took time over. This is probably the only exception, and that's mainly because it includes the hit singles The Last Time and Satisfaction, both all-time classics; the rather funny Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man; and the irritatingly catchy One More Try. Elsewhere the band throws in a slew of soul covers and offcuts. It's a shame the original UK Out Of Our Heads, something of a soul 'concept' album, isn't available in place of this good but mixed collection."
2,Poor baby can't spell or get an editor who can spell,"There are far too many misspelled and/or misused words in Shapiro's book, but this one is world-class: ""sensilmillia"" is how Laurie and her editors and proofreaders spell sinsemilla.Four -- count'em -- four spelling mistakes in that one word.Awesome."
2,Unexpected Rambling,"It started out so good. It took me in so successfully that I pushed myself through the pointless ramblings and storylines that had nothing to do with the main story, waiting for the spark in the beginning to come back. Didn't happen. Uggh. The main storyline was still good though and I wanted to know what happened to the main characters in the end.I was disappointed. It seems like the author just shoved a lot of unrelated tidbits together or something."
5,A fun book with surprising depth,"I knew this book was going to be funny, my friend had been pushing for me to read it, but I didn't think it was haunt me afterwards. Whoever Laurie Gwen Shapiro is, well done!"
2,lots of rambling punctuated by an occasional laugh,"There were occasional high points, but most of the premises and the dialogue felt too contrived. I have an extensive library at home but this novel won't reside there."
3,A good summer read,"As a native New Yawker, I found this book quite fun & accurate in its portrayal on the New York end. While not exactly deep and meaningful, the characters are engaging, and it is an easy and entertaining read."
5,hilarious fun,"I got this book fro the holidays from my girlfriend. It's a book that I think would appeal to men and women, especially those with an urban humor.I hope it is going to be made into a movie. The book would translate well. Reading the novel is especially rewarding too. You get the sense Laurie Gwen Shapiro is a great wit to watch"
4,The perfect book for the off-beat chick lit fan.,"What a fabulously funny novel! The absurdity & the characters were first rate. The main character, Rachel Ganelli, comes back to New York from Australia after the ""murder"" of one of her roommates & the real chaos begins when her half-Jewish half-Italian family has to take care of the supposive corpse. There's even a romantic plot interwoven in the trials and tribulations of these quirky characters trying to do good. I could go on about this book for days, but I don't want to give any of the good stuff away. If you love chick lit in spite of your punk/hipster lifestyle, then this is the perfect book for you. And if you just love entertaining, well-written light lit, then it's perfect for you as well. Go read this!"
4,Nuggets,"""History Goes to the Movies"" is filled with historical nuggets, interesting episodes and facts from the past that most general readers would be very unlikely to ever read in another source. Hollywood movies, of course, overflow with political correctness, and it is refreshing indeed to read this gem of a book which over and over sets the record straight with facts, not polemics. Parents should keep this book handy. Most young people today read little history. Perhaps after viewing an historical movie our children will be motivated to pick up this well written book, read a few pages and learn something about the true historical context of the movie they just viewed."
1,Right-Wing HIstory Goes to the movies,"The author's historiographic slant is extremely conservative. He claims that the portrait of ""nuts and bolts plantation operations"" in Gone With the Wind, is ""right on the money"". Reviewing Ken Loach's Land and Freedom he denies that Franco was a fascist. Of Platoon he claims that Oliver Stone vastly exaggerates the extent of atrocities like My Lai. So this is historical film as seen through the eyes of a ""history buff"" apparently unacquainted with current history writing, or even journalistc accounts. Even if the reader sympathizes with, or is willing to overlook the author's political ideology, ninety percent of each entry is historical background. So there's really very little about each film, and far to much of the author's own revision of history. Given the need for such a book, and the appealing title, ""History Goes to the Movies"" is a major disappointment."
4,TOTALLY ADDICTICTED TO PURETONE!!!,"Again, I have stumbled across another incredible CD out of sheer depression...Hey, some people eat--I buy CDs! Having got that off my chest, I picked up Puretone after sampling it in the record store. An awesome CD with tremendous dance floor appeal! ""Headroom"" is a funk-fest reminiscent of some late 80's Paula Abdul cut...""Addicted to Bass""--the best thing on this set--is D&B, 60s go-go, funk and rock all rolled into one, sure to get that thang shakin'...""Hypersensitive"" is a melancholy number that reminds you of a Sinead O'Connor tune--Be warned, though, you may get a little teary-eyed listening to it...""Lift Me Up"" is a R&B influenced cut that is inspiring as it is funky... and the real and in your face track, ""Echoes"", that is hypnotic and infectiously groovy! All other cuts on ""Stuck in A Groove"" are just as good as the ones I mentioned, mind you. It's just that these, in my opinion, are the stand-out tracks. Go out and buy the CD, then you be the judge!"
2,Too many inaccuracies.,"There are many inaccuracies in this book. For example, just in the section where Tsar Nicholas II meets his future wife Alexandra (Alix), the author states that Alix's mother, Alice, was the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria; Alice was actually Victoria's second daughter (and her third child). The book also claims that Alix lost her elder brother and younger sister just following their mother's death, when in reality, both of those children died prior to their mother's death. This book is interesting enough, but don't rely on it for accurate historical information."
3,Rocky it's not,"I just finished watching the boxer with my wife. I was surprised at the fact she liked this film. I won't ruin the film by telling you in detail what happens. I will tell you that if you love boxing movies this is a pretty decent film. It is low budget and that makes a lot of people tune out. I don't understand why since it still is a good little movie. You don't get awsome effects during the fight scenes, but you do get a good story and that is what this movie is. A good story that doesn't have endless sex and violence. It is a film you can watch with your family and just enjoy. I know my wife enjoyed this film. I have trouble sometimes finding movies that me and my wife can get into. I love horror movies but my wife doesn't. It was a nice change to just enjoy a movie together. So if your looking for a movie to enjoy with your family look no further. If you want sex, violence, and profanity, well then look elsewhere. This is a movie with a good story to tell."
2,"Save your money, makes a good coffee coaster","Well I typed this out in detail and just as I entered my first ""tag"" I lost everything. So I don't want to type all this again so take it from me, every scene came out of some other boxing movie (but as one writer stated definitely not Rocky). I bought it because ""Joe"" (Stacy Keach ) a retired boxer (with a secret) and now gym owner became reluctant Ben's trainer (poor Ben was a reluctant ex-convict who went to jail saving his mother- his secret). Keach was a great actor (in his day). They used every cliché used in every cheap movie to evoke emotion and try to create interest in a VERY LOW BUDGET MOVIE."
3,not bad at all,"Not sure why Steve (""SLV Video"") is so grouchy about this one. I'm not tone-deaf, and I liked the music just fine! It's interesting to see a German production and watch Stacy Keatch in action again... Definitely worth a look."
3,Worth A Rental,"Rocky, this is not, and the storyline was pretty predictable. It is though a valiant effort on what I am sure was a very limited budget. I think if the screenplay would have been better would have helped.I have seen worse such as Fighting Tommy Riley, which I thought was pure crap. The Boxer is worth a rental, but hardly a keeper for the dvd library. It really could have been so much more. Give it a shot, but don't expect any great thrills or twists."
3,It's not what it's cracked up to be,"I liked the idea of a folding wooden patio table, and easily store it during the winter months when not in use. The table was beautiful and pretty easy to assemble out of the box, however, after a week or so of rain, and within a month of purchase, the wood table top cracked in a couple places, and needless to say, I am not terribly happy about that. What I read about care for Eucalyptus wood before purchasing this item was that you should need to do nothing for the first few months, but periodically apply something like Teak oil every few month thereafter. Obviously ""they"" are full of beans! Being I have bought 6 matching Eucalyptus chairs elsewhere, I will try to repair the table, put some teak oil on, then a good coat of water sealant to preserve it!"
5,Prince Valiant Volume 2 - Well Worth It,"This incredible animated show from the 90's is still spectacular today. As soon as I saw that it was available for purchase, I bought it immediately!!! It's full of great stories that wonderfully unfold, surprise and teach. It's a must-have for any serious animation collector. Valiant and his friends' quest for knighthood in Camelot is inspiring...something that sadly, today's cartoons are not."
5,"The Legend of Prince Valiant: The Complete Series, Vol. 2","A great cartoon film! I was watching it in 1996, I was 13 years old and the movie was my favourite one! To tell the truth at that time I was watching it in Russian. Years past, but the cartoon movie has been remaining my favourite one. Resently I decided to find it in DVD or the like format. I couln't find it in Russian, but basically I didn't care of the language. Thanks to Amazon.com I'm watching my childhood favourite cartoon!!!"
3,Another somebody done somebody wrong story,"This is another love story that is just OK. I can't really decide what went wrong for me, but I know that the stars of this movie are much better actors than this. Piper moves across country with her boyfriend (Artie Lange). She gave up family, a job, etc., for him. What happens? He decides to leave her and Piper is left heart broken. Piper moves on and marries someone else. Artie is crushed that Piper has married because the longer he is away from her, he realizes that he really can't live without her. Piper divorces 3 years later and their friendship rekindles. Will the 2nd time around be better than the first time around?"
1,They're both clueless,"It tries to be innovative, but starting the movie 1/4 of the way through and then going back to the beginning has been done to death. So has the voice-over. So to me, this movie had two strikes against it from the very start.I was still willing to give it a try and hope it would get better. It didn't.There was no passion or excitement. There was no outside or situational interference. It was just two shallow people so wrapped up in their own wants and needs that they couldn't give a fig about each other.So to me Perfect Opposites wasn't a Romance OR a Comedy. It was a long, dreary mess about 2 people who refused to accept any responsibility for their trail of broken relationships, and just kept blaming the other person."
4,Chick/Date Flick,"Better than you'd expect. The cast is pretty. The script is a little above average. The plot, well, you can't have everything. You'll see it all coming. This one is about looking at the beautiful people and watching them go through their antics."
2,A chick flick even my wife didn't like,"Ok, it was a little fun to watch the moview industry make fun of itself by setting the film in L.A. and viewing Hollywood from a legal point of view. But that aspect if the film was paper-thin and underdeveloped.Our main characters graduate from an east-coast type college and head to L.A. with ideas if long-love and riches. As they hit rocky times finically, so does their relationship. (...) (Why is it that every romantic comedy uses the same cut-n-paste mold for 30-something married couples? It's so old it's down right boring.)They both act like jerks to each other (but him more then her), they split up, realize they still love each other, and SUPRISE, get back together. However, the get-back-together scene at the end is hollow and empty (although perhaps more realistic) and left my chick-flick loving wife feeling robbed of the romantic moment when they run back into each other's arms, cry and kiss, and ride off into the sunset.In a nut shell, don't bother."
1,poor customer service,Rival does have very poor customer service as motioned in another review. The hotline is always busy during work hours and they do not react to E-mails at all. I finally got myself a foodsaver as a replacement! The seal-a-meal lasted for about 1.5 years and after this the seams do not hold up any more and finally one lid release button broke as well. All of this might be repairable issues - but without customer service the device is useless. The foodsaver models are far more advanced these days!
1,I wouldn't recommend this,"My mom got me this for a gift. It is a piece of junk. I have had it for 2 weeks, and its already broke. I can only get it to work properly half the time, and when it does work, I have to practically sit on it to get it closed because the latch already broke, and then I have to hold it with one hand so I can use the other to keep it closed."
4,Sigma 150mm f/2.8 Macro lens,great lens and a great price. it has a nice feel to it. not too heavy and not too light. autofocus is somewhat slow but that is expected from a macro lens. otherwise its a great lens
5,Spent a lot of time looking before I bought the Sigma 150...,"And I am very happy with it. Wanted to get into Macro but didn't want to spring for the Nikor. This one got excellent reviews. One reviewer who was not a big Sigma fan said this is the only Sigma he considers to be the equal of Nikon. Have been snapping bugs in the yard and getting some very nice shots. Impressed with the build, feels solid, mostly/all metal. I also added the Sigma 1.4 teleconverter to get even closer shots. Very nice combo.IMO people who are complaining about depth-of-field and focusing don't really understand macro lenses."
3,AF doesn't work,I purchased this lens about a week ago. I have not had the opportunity to shoot many pictures with it but from the first time I tried it the Auto Focus failed to work with the shutter button. It does focus (fairly accurately) with the AF button on my Canon 40D. I contacted Sigma and after 4 days they had not given me an answer. I wrote again and the reply I got was that maybe because the 40D was a new Canon model the engineers had not taken some adjustments into account. They also said that it would take them about a week to get a reply from the engineers.With Canon I usually get a reply to my email within one day and the explanations to my questions are accurate and to the point.This is not a cheap lens but compared to a Canon L lens its very much less. I guess the poor service and the engineering flaw is the difference in price between a Sigma and a Canon L lens.
5,Great lens,"This is a great Macro lens, if you take your time to learn how to use it.It's tack sharp, handles very well, construction quality is very high.I got a long macro lens because of the longer working distance and the more pleasing background blur you get. It's a bit harder to use, because DOF becomes narrower and any movements are magnified. With some practice, this became a non issue, and it's quickly become my favorite lens. The IQ is great( sharpness, contrast, bokeh, color). It feels well balanced on my 30D with battery grip and Canon twinlite flash. A bit on the heavy side, but well balanced.The only downside is AF speed. For macro and tight portraits this isn't an issue, as I use MF only for these shots, but this is a lens I would never use for sports or action photography( specially compared to my 135L). As this review is about the lens and it's intended use( macro), I give it a 5 star rating."
5,Can't ask for more,"This is a fantastic lens. Optical quality is spot on, and for a macro it does everything a macro lens should. It focuses incredibly closely, shots are perfectly clear and free from distortion, chromatic aberration, and color reproduction is great. Yes, it focuses slow, but that is because of the huge range that little HSM motor covers. Being able to focus from a few inches to infinity has its price, but being a macro you really must focus manually or you are gambling with what the camera chooses. With such a small depth of field manual focus is the only way to guarantee good results.Like other EX lenses from Sigma this one feels rock solid, with fit and finish that rivals the other manufacturer's top of the line products. The lack of OS should not be a deal breaker; with the small amount of light and larger apertures that you deal with at macro distances, you will be using a tripod more often than not anyway."
4,Sigma 150mm f/2.8 MACRO LENS,"At first I was somewhat disappointed for I did not receive the exact lens. The lens I received did not have the MF/AF switch. This can be changed through the dslr, this works for me. It has allowed me to take some terrific macro pictures. I have posted a few pictures to illustrate."
3,Pretty...,"I thought these panties were a great deal. They arrived super fast and WERE very pretty, I only wore them once because the second time I put them on the elastic had become unsecured."
4,Entertaining,The whole reason I purchased this game was because my older brother had it and was playing it with my nephew and said they were having a blast. So I went and purchased it for my son and me to play and we have just as much fun as they do.
2,"Lots of fact, not good theory","Since I was writing a book on the LDS, I looked closely at some of Quinn's books. I have to say for historical knowledge Quinn must be praised, however, in terms of good history he falls short. As an anthropolgist, one key element is to tell things from the point of view of the people studied, not from your own view. The very term magic is ethnocentric (judging another culture from your own standards). Terms like magic establish an us and them relationship where we are superior to the they who believe in magic. Magic is always somebody elses religion. While this might be a great way to sell books by using this type of sensationalism, it is not the way to write a scholarly book, which Quinn claims to be doing. I have met an anthropologist who said he had warned Quinn about using the term magic as he did, but Quinn ignored him."
4,Amazing Research,"Again, Quinn has confronted a touchy topic in Mormon history. And again his research is extensive. This is an important topic to understand in Mormon culture, though few do. I did not like how he attacked other historians by name and then disproved their ideas. I would rather just see the facts, and in the footnotes see the names and references of the oposite or incorrect ideas or research. As I read the footnotes I only found one problem. Quinn makes a absolute statement about Josephine Fisher and his reference is anything but absolute almost as if Quinn were attempting to change history. Overall I enjoyed this scholarly work and recommend it to anyone interested in Mormon History, Quinn is a great historian."
5,Bullet in the Head (Streets of Bloodshed),"This movie will change your life forever! It has me disturbed, in tears, in shock, and it made me think about things very closely (friendship)! This movie is not for everyone, but it has a very important message that everyone should know! John Woo's best!"
1,18 minutes cut from this VHS and DVD!,"Yes its true, unless you saw the movie in its theatrical debut or live in France and happen to own a laserdisc player you have never seen the full version of this film.The full version runs 138 or 135 minutes(depending which ending, there are 2). Its a very different film compared to this hacked up for the rest of the world version. ITS NOT RIGHT!And how about those subtitles? I don't even speak the language and i could have done a better job than that! They even dub Tony Leung in his own language for some beyond strange reason.This DVD is a throw away.Wait and hope until Anchor Bay gets the full print and beefs it up. This is just pathetic."
4,"Sad, depressing yet absolutley brilliant",This is one of the John Woo's Best films.He takes his viewers through the Darkness in his most personal work an epic depicting of the lives of three childhood friends trapped in hell through the turmoil of the War in Vietnam.This film is extreamly depressing yet very raw and brilliant. This film will probably make you sad and depressed but still this is a very well made film and I give credit to the actors who made this movie what it is.4.9 out of 5 stars.
3,"masterpiece mutilated, film 5 stars, this edition 0","i haven't got the DVD yet but this VHS is pretty horrible. does Tai Seng even know chinese? when the americans speak in the film subtitles are still playing even in english and they are really way way off from what they are really saying! this is a angering reminder that what the chinese actors are supposedly saying is not what they are really saying. after 1 hour it seems tai seng gave up on the subtitles and just started mindlessly typing, some are repeated over and over. and a good 3 minutes has been hacked from this version making the film look sloppy and some scenes making absolutly no sense at all. the film itself is great. tony gives one of his best performances ever. everyone should see this film but not like this. hope the DVD isn't this bad. there is a very early VHS edition that has correct subtitles and scenes intact, wonder where it is. anchor bay, are you listening?"
3,"A dark, brutal rip-off.","Haven't we seen this story before? How about The Deer Hunter? How about Rebel Without A Cause? How about Treasure of the Sierra Madre? Okay, John Woo usually steals his plots from other movies, but here it was much more blatant than usual. Also, the picture is REALLY grim and violent, even by Woo's standards. And the subtitles are pretty lame (""Damn up!"" being my favorite example). Finally: no Chow Yun-Fat, and nobody else with his charisma in the leading roles. Tony Leung is good, but not enough."
2,Exhausted,"In ""The Killer"", perhaps the best pulp/asian thriller of all time, the violence felt full, voluptuous; its excess created a kind of operatic grandeur. In ""Bullet in the Head"" the violence is so over -the-top, so gratuitous, you want to run for cover (I might have blown up my tv if I had to watch another gangster do a cartwheel as a big explosion lifted him of his feet). This movie proves to me how repetitive a director Woo is, and I got a similar feeling from Face/Off - its like watching a figure skater do figure 8's all night - you want to shout ""ok, I get it!""Loud, irritating and chaotic. Jacky Cheung's shameless overacting and bulgy, beady eyes were as irksome as the excessive violence - give this one a miss - its a wet blanket of sentimentality and schlock."
5,Excellent selection of tunes and instruments; never boring.,"Very enjoyable variety of styles and sounds. Better than most of this genre because there is no repetitive sameness from one selection to the next. Music you will want to share with those you care about. Refreshing and interesting, it keeps you looking forward to the next selection."
5,The Unfair Advantage,"Mark was one of my all-time favorite drivers. Mark and Roger were a great team like Jim Clark and Colin Chapman. Even though I met both Mark and Roger, I never realized how important Mark was to the team besides one of the best of the great drivers."
1,Do not order this from amazon,this book ships from the vendor using some second rate shipping service. Mine never arrived. Amazon asked me to cancel my order and replace it! They wanted me to fix my order! I bet it has something do to with the vendor relationship and suggest you do not order this book thru amazon.
5,One of the great racing tomes,"This book is easily one of the best narratives about racing I've ever come across. It is a personal and honest account of the late Mark Donahue's racing career from his impromptu start to the zenith of his career in Formula 1, Indy Racing, and Can Am to his retirement.Anyone who races or aspires to race will delight in his firsthand recollections of his racing exploits and his perspective on one of the great programs in motorsport history (the Can Am Porsche 917).Highly recommended."
3,in the mood for a simple mystery? pick this one then!,"Juliette is at it again. The stay~at~home~mom's fitness trainer is found dead and it is ruled as supposed suicide. Juliette pokes her nose and starts investigating and learns it was murder. Bobby Katz had some secrets his fiancee, Betsy, did not know about and secrets he himself only found out recently!Cozy, entertaining mystery but nothing that grand."
4,Improving,"Ayelet Waldman improves with each entry in this series. In this episode, Juliet Applebaum's trainer commits suicide...or is it suicide? Juliet feels something amiss and begins delving into his background, including his adopted family, his birth mother, his drug-addicted fiancee.I enjoy these books because the author does a great job of mixing mystery with day-to-day life without compromising the realism of either. I am glad that she is involving Juliet in the private detective business of her friend Al, because in many series there occurs a disbelief when a ""normal"" person (one outside the private detective or police world, for example) runs across too many murders.Looking forward to the next entry."
4,"No blood, lots of guts","I'm an avid mystery reader (PD James, D Sayers, R Hill) and enjoy Waldman's series immensely. Characters come across, even with brief descriptions and the dialogue is full of things I wish I'd have the chutzpah to say myself. I picked up 'Playdate' and didn't put it down until I was done.As a new mom I relate totally to Juliet Applebaum (what mother wouldn't?!) and I greatly appreciate the lack of blood and gore. Many mystery writers rely on these devices to hold audience interest but Waldman never sinks to this level, instead relying on factual revelations and character analysis to further the plot development. Granted, one won't find a Dalglieshian tortured soul expounding on human philosophy while quoting WH Auden, but for an enjoyable, quick-paced humorous read I would recommend this book and series highly."
1,poor writing and boring storytelling,"I had the bad idea of picking up this book for a long flight, knowing nothing about its author. It turned out to be worse than the airline food. The writing is truly awful, clumsy yet full of conceit. The plot and the characters seem lifted from things you've read somewhere else but much better realized. I confess I was quite surprised that something like this got published. That's the only real mystery about this profoundly mediocre, boring and superfluous novel."
2,Title deceiving,"The book would be better titled HOMOerotic stories. Every short story focuses on sex with a vampire and all but one are graphic same sex couplings. I don't really have a problem with that except that it is not my bag and I felt tricked that I bought a gay sex book. I actually bought the book for my wife who likes vampire stories, I read it because I read everything that comes into the house. She couldn't finish it and I had to force myself. It would have helped if the writing was less amateurish."
2,Not For Triathletes with Swimming Backgrounds!,"I come from a swimming background, and I am focusing my training on the improvement of my biking and running skills. I still like to spend about half of my weekly exercise time in the pool. If you enjoy swimming, avoid this book. It is for the pool-fearing."
2,Miles Versus Minutes,"While the training schedule is nice and well explained - the premise of the training schedule is based on minutes exercised, rather than distance. Had I known this prior to puchasing the book, I would not have bought it. A triathalon is based on completing a certain distance in 3 disciplines, not a set number of minutes. This is my first triathalon, so my expectations were not too high in terms of other content, but the minutes versus miles schedule is a big turn-off.Additionally, I found the author providing a lot of anecdotal information about his races. I was looking for general information on how to prepare for my first race, not a story about how this guys gets ready too slow in the morning, so he got up before everyone else. The author also states up front that he is not a master in any of the 3 sports composing the triathalon, and references 3 other books to read. Had I known all of this ahead of time, I would have bought the other books he references instead."
2,Out of date!,"I didn't realize how out of date this book was, or I would not have bought it. The book makes 80s-era references when it comes to diet, nutrition, and other books about fitness. He suggests that you'd better plan to spend a whole $45 dollars on a good pair of running shoes!The author is readable, and his personal experiences are somewhat interesting. But although he is an M.D., there seems to be no scientific basis for his recommendations - it is all based on his personal experience."
4,Great Book for Beginners!,"This book is an excellent read for the beginning triathlete. It takes you step by step through nutrition, basic aerobic fitness and finally into triathlon training. The only thing that I wish it contained were swimming and biking techniques. It explains which swimming stoke to use, but doesn't elaberate on the stoke itself. The author does, however, site many other authors on technique throughout this book that would be helpful. It seems that if the author added an extra chapter devoted to some basic biking/swimming techniques, this would be all the information you would need to get started."
2,"Good for beginners, otherwise...","It got me pumped up in the beginning, but I found it to be not aggressive enough partway thru the book. It really bogs down on stuff that endurance athletes already know instinctively, and thru practice.If you're a couch potato, and want to get in shape, think about triathloning, you won't get bored doing one thing like running or biking. This book would be for you. Very simple, and not very specific.If you've already done one of the three endurance sports, look for another book, I know I am..."
4,Dynarex Gauze,"This is a fine product that works perfectly for the job intended. If I have any negative remarks it is that this gauze is a little too stringy and thus sometimes falls apart somewhat easily. Otherwise, it is thick and strong and I would purchase again. It is a good value and the delivery was very quick."
4,Tender and Unique,Newsom is a superior musician. She seems like the girl in high school you always wanted to know more about but seemed only to be in love with math. She's exceedingly clever and curious. A valuable addition to any indie-modeled music collection.
4,A truly enjoyable CD,"...which may sound like faint praise, but I don't mean it that way. This CD makes you feel good and comfy. I saw her open for Bonnie Prince Billy and at the end of her set, I realized a stupid grin had been plastered across my face the whole time. Buy this CD."
2,Terrible vocals,"I would also like to like this album, but unlistenable vocal shrieking is not part of a mastery of the folk craft. It disturbs me that this album receives such critical aclaim. She may be able to craft a good song, but why in the world does she have to sing so horribly. Instead of this, i recommend that you spend your money on something that is beautiful all around, such as the new Edith Frost album, ""It's a Game"". Edith masters the craft and executes beautifully."
4,Don't listen to K. Dorey,Don't listen to K. Dorey. Every review he's ever done is either 1 star or 5 stars. Nuff said.You should check Joanna Newsom out. The sound is fresh and this is the most consistently good CD I've listened to in a long time.
1,"Sorry, but no.","My Father bought this CD based on the glowing reviews from the New York Times. We both recoiled in disbelief as the harp & keyboard drowned out into wretched sounding vocals. That's the only way I can describe her vocals: wretched & fake. It sounds like Joanna is forcing and twisting her voice into something that it's not. I think she is a worthy musician, her lyrics are very creative and the instrumentals are innovative. But, I just can't get over the forced-out scratchy, twisted vocals. I get the sense that Joanna hasn't really found her ""voice"" yet and is banking on this forced-out, contrived folksy sound to set her apart in the folk scene. Sorry, I don't buy it... I want to hear the real thing, please!"
1,I laughed and cried too....,"....but not because it was good. Seriously, for those folks who actually say the unattractive features of her voice are great, why not just run your nails across a chalkboard, it's much cheaper than buying this cd.As to her harping, it's quite bad. Good harping is supposed to sound smooth and contain seamless bridges. It almost sounds as if she's snapping the strings with a clip. There isn't anything that is musically pleasing about this ""music,"" if it even can be called that. I suspect most of its appeal comes from percieved social pressures (people thinking they look cool forcing themselves to listen to, and even enjoy, it.)"
1,Yikes.,"First time reviewer. I bought this CD based on the many positive reviews written here and after listening three painful times can confirm (1) the positive reviews have got to be a joke, (2) she sounds a lot more like a Lisa Simpson parody than Bjork (which makes me want to apologize to Lisa), and (3) on my deathbed I will rue the lost minutes I wasted listening to this weirdness and trying to comprehend how and why others would recommend listening to it, much less buying it."
5,harp for the not-so-faint of heart,"I have a friend who got her hands on a bootleg copy of Joanna Newsom's first CD, and I listened to it over and over and over, until I found out that she had released this one! The CDs share some songs, but there is much new material--and it's as good as expected, from anyone who has heard Newsom before. If you are new to this pixie-like harp player, give the CD a chance, and that means: play it at least three or four times, the songs start growing on you. And her voice, at first thought to be a little too whiny, turns out to be magical and unlike anything else I have heard."
2,Eeek!,"I'm sure I'll get bashed repeatedly by those who love her, and I'm sure Joanna is a fine, lovable person... but I would liken my enjoyment of this cd to that of watching a double feature of ""Showgirls"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". If you can get past her fingernails-on-chalkboard voice, there might be something there, but I couldn't find it."
4,out of nowhere,"Spurred on by an effusive review of her at the time unreleased follow-up album, 'YS', I decided to check this one out. Truly it comes from out of nowhere. Comparisons are always odious, as kerouac said, and in newsom's case, even more so. She of course does have antecedents, and did not grow up playing her harp and singing (like that!) on a deserted island (I say deserted, not desert, as she doesn't evoke images of palms and white sand, rather pines and glowering clouds)... so: no name dropping. This is simply hertfelt music by a young and playful woman with her own way of phrasing things, her own mythology and her own feyness and darknesses. Rather than make a list of singer-songwriters, or worse, pioneer women, just listen to 'Sadie'.Or, impulse buy the record. Something new."
3,Please ! This is a must-listen-before-buying artist!,"I tried really hard to like this album.The instrumentals are lovely. Newsom is a talented musicican. Sadly,her voice is not on par with her other gifts. She's a wonderful songwriter and lyricist. I just wish she'd give over the vocals to someone who can sing. Her atonal squawk is horrific. If I could remove the vocals, I would. This CD would be 5 stars without the vocals or with a competent singer."
3,Lisa Simpson called...,"...she wants her voice back. This is an either/or album. If you can get past/ like the vocals then this is a great album, if not then it is like listening to somebody strangling cats. I have a bunch of friends/ relatives who by and large listen to great music that absolutely love this album and can't stop praising it; again, I just can't get past the vocals. Listen carefully and repeatedly if you are uncertain. Good luck."
4,Challenging but worth it,"This is a fascinating record. As all the earlier reviews indicate, your enjoyment of Joanna Newsom's music will hinge entirely on whether you can appreciate her decidedly eccentric vocal style. And yes, it definitely takes some getting used to.But if you can suspend judgement and accept the unconventional (as jazz fans had to do with Coltrane and classical lovers had to do with Stravinsky) you will find this album haunting, hypnotic and enormously satisfying.Some reviewers have made a good suggestion: check out a few of the clips. If your musical mind is open enough, you won't regret giving Newsom a chance. She will win you over."
1,Goodness...!,"A record for Bjork fans who would like to know why some of us dislike Bjork. One listen to this and they will get the same effect Bjork has on me. This is not, however, a record for those who dislike Bjork. An unholy union of Bjork and Yoko. I'm sure the lyrics are excellent as some say but I cannot get far enough past the voice to hear them. A great pity, I'm sure, but I can live with that loss as I cannot live with this music."
1,the first and last time i ever comment on anything....,"it's that awful. comparisons to bjork? really? if by similar people mean white and female, then yes, i suppose they are. this is the emperor's robe of ""more original than thou"" really deep thinkers. can you hear it? can you? it's the most striking , profound album of 2004. really."
4,Predictably Unappriciated,"Newsomes album is a beautiful and refreshing statement from a very talented artist. Her songs were written originally for self amusement on long walks she used to take and therefore it is fairly hard to believe she honed her lyrics or unique voice in order to woo a ""indie"" crowd or ""indie"" critics. Most people who enjoy Newsomes music do it because it is an interesting and entertaining portreyal of how she views her world. And most people who dislike it are those afraid of anything new; or afraid to step outside of their boundries like genre' and format. I recomend this album for anyone who enjoys a diverse style loosely resembling folk pop, and would not recomend it to those who think MADtv is funny."
1,awful singer,"Maybe her harp playing could be acceptable, but when she sings... everything turns awful. The worst singer I ever heard."
4,Amusing and clever,"I borrowed my daughter's car, and the CD in the player was poised on ""Bridges and Balloons""! I had to laugh. And I had to hit the ""Repeat"" button, because I wanted to decipher the lyrics. I still haven't figured them all out, I'm having fun trying. As others have said before, her voice grows on you. Her playing is charming. And her lyrics are fun and clever and intriguing. I've played it for friends, and they've had to laugh, too. No, she'll never be mainstream, but she'll have a loyal following..."
5,Aquired taste...,"Nobody can make such a defining statement as the person who compared Joanna Newsom's voice to a bandsaw, it disgusts me when people say things that they think to be true as a unifying truth. The person who made this comment does not speak for everyone.Joanna Newsom's voice is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had the pleasure to hear. I am no hipster, I simply love music. Which this is, despite what certain ignorant fools may proclaim.Of the most beautiful, enthralling kind. It may not appeal to some, but like another said, those who it does appeal to are better for it.'The Book of Right-On', 'Peach, Pear, Plum' and 'Sprout and the Bean' are all highlights."
5,A beautiful album,"Miss Newsom is an excellent musician. Once one becomes accustomed to her unusual, but hauntingly lovely voice, the poetry of her words washes over you. Well written and expertly performed."
4,joanna newson music,"joanna's music is good, exspecially for kids. I have the cd and I'm not that young, really to grown for it. but I like it. overall its a nice cd. its nice to see young people make a life to music."
2,"Interesting - Music is Great, But She Makes My Eye Twitch","At first sound I wanted to yell, ""Make it stop!"".The second time I listened with an open heart and quite honestly I thought album was very creative, the music was great, but that voice...to me it's something that you either love or hate. I'm in the latter category. All I could think of was Carol Channing, very drunk singing loudly to the night air, stumbling down the street on her way home. The creative aspects of this album, for me, cannot be redeemed due to the silliness of the vocals. That being said, I can understand how she could appeal to some. I'm just not one of the some."
3,New to some,"With unique instrumentation and personality to spare, Newsom still comes across a tad overeager. Her eccentric quirkiness is exploited, though there are at least a couple complete songs here which show she possesses the real deal."
2,Holy cow!,"Great music, Audio quality is very good. The Harp is delightful. I like it a lot until Joanna opens her mouth. Like fingernails on a chalkboard, bless her heart."
1,I didn't believe it possible,"But she actually sounds like a mix of Yoko Ono and a seven year old child; I fully agree with the other epitaphs like 'Weapon of Mass Destruction' or 'sounds like a cat dying..'. Boy, am I glad I read the reviews before I bought this stinker. Zero stars definitely should be possible"
1,It made me wince,"I bought this album because I read a review that said it was a nice relaxing one to listen to with a cup of tea...[...] As I listen to this album I get the peculiar feeling that I am listening to a demon-possessed child. Is this a joke? When I was in the fifth grade I went around singing in my ""bad voice"" just to annoy the boys on the playground. [...]The lyrics make no sense either, she just throws in pretentious sounding phrases like, ""a hat made from a page of Camu."" I've read a lot of Camu, but I don't get the significance of that line. What confuses me is why so many people have listened to her shreaking voice and called it art, called it good. Has anyone ever heard of the Emperor's New Clothes? People, it's time to wake up and hear the shreaking demon!"
1,unlistenable,music? is about music then whateverelse. This is painful on the ears and not music for the sane!
4,This guy is funny.,"Kinda like Garrison Keillor--only doing his own sound effects. And instead of Lutherans and snow, it's Methodists and sweet tea."
4,Great P.G Once again !,"This CD is great ! . The band is as tight as one would expect . Songs are great . There are a few songs that might fit more on a RacerX , Jimi Kidd monicker but thats pretty minor . The happy go lucky theme is the only difference . Pauls a little more serious it seems . One could argue he's gone a little over the top with the nasa theme , playing in a space , but hey....he's Paul . Linus of hollywood and Marco Minneman are great!Since it's the ""Burning Organ "" line up , he seems more definitive and confident playing with these guys and rightfully so , there awesome . There is moment in songs 4-8 that could go to Racer x , Jimi Kidd but the rest is unmistakedly P.G . The tuners are still super hooky , beatle-esqe melodies with P.G solos which still sounds like someone playing with six fingers . P.G 4 G3 !"
3,Too much show off too little songs,"Ok I like shredding as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when you need to back up a little and actually make a song with a melody or at least some direction. Most of this album has neither. It's a platform for showing off and I was disappointed in it to that degree. Paul Gilbert is a talented musician, I know he can do better."
4,It rocks. But it rocked catchier before,"I received my Japan-imported CD today.OK, this album does not work as quick as the albums before, I didn't have a favourite tune in my ear after hearing it once.But Paul Gilbert plays and sings his songs nevertheless with passion and you can just hear him enjoying every note.And after a few times hearing it though, the songs got catchier every time. After 4 times hearing it in a row, i can hardly sit still in my chair. Paul Gilbert still rocks.I rated 4 stars, because Paul caught me with albums like Alligator Farm a bit faster. But the CD is still a must have for every Gilbert Fan."
4,Soothing,"Beautiful, relaxing music. I collected the whole ""Enhancing your Mind Body Spirit "" magazine and finished it in June 2009. I missed the issue that gave this CD away with it but found it here on Amazon. It's lovely . really enjoy it."
3,No Index. Without an index the book is reduced to a pleasure read.,"I live in the Andes, three hours from Cusco, among the Quechua. This book is Julia's diary that she wrote after spending a year in the Andean town of Tambo (`corn planting', `my birthday', `barley planting'). The text has an abundance of words, but bringing the reader little anthropological insight into the life of the Quechua people. It is one thing to say ""the men continued to plant corn,"" and another to explain how and why.The author states up front, ""I am an artist, not an anthropologist,"" and she details the lives of Andean men and women from this perspective. What Julia accomplished, as an artist, is akin to an anthropologist trying to paint an accomplished landscape. The results will probably be a lot of color, with little definition.Though the back cover touts the book as having ""a wealth of ethnographic detail,"" without an index, and written from an artist's vantage point, what you get is a pleasant read."
5,Settlers of Catan lovers very happy.,"This cookie cutter is sturdy, doesn't stick, food doesn't get in seams. We made Settler of Catan edible game with it and it came out wonderfully. I was happy to find a single hexagon and very excited by how well it was made."
1,Unknown Ingredients,"I emailed the company and asked them what species was in their product. They didn't know! You're rolling the dice when you buy a product based on its common name -- rather than its scientific, Latin name -- it could contain anything. Many natural products have the same common name but are completely unrelated. This is exactly the kind of practice that gives herbs and their vendors a bad name. Know what you are selling to your customers!"
1,This should be a comic book,"Trooper Mark Black!?! He sounds like a comic book hero...and it's just that writing style which I find Ryan uses in his books.The character is undercover, he's under the watchful eye of his older brother [Andy Black..the names get worse] and there's even a female spy thrown in for good measure. They get compromised and they must fight their way out to the Chilean border. The latter is perhaps the only contribution that Ryan has actual experience of. Then, twenty years later, those naughty Argies are at it again and this time a more experienced Black returns and guess what?...he bumps into that spy again etc. etc. etc.A poor plot, lifeless characters and an immature writing style. All this book needs is some comic artwork throughout and it will be a book the whole family can enjoy."
3,Not so good,"This book was dissappointing, i was expecting better of Ryan.The story is not so good, the names (Mark and Andy Black)and it wasn't the usual class of Ryan that i'm use too.it isn't that bad,there are some nice parts in the story, but overall i'm dissapointed.I think 3 stars are justified."
1,A Waste of Paper,"Whoever is responsible for hiring the editor of this book should be fired immediately. The editor should have been fired when he recommended publication.Simply put, there is no story to this story. It reads like a battle diary. Up to disk 7 (of 11), when I gave up listening to the audiobook version, there had been detailed descriptions of 2 SAS engagements in Argentina, with no reason to connect them, and no storyline at all.Save your money.Larry Bellinger"
4,The Age,"Happened upon this nifty book in the counterculture section of my local bookstore and bought two copies.The author takes us on a spirited, insightful sojourn through the backalleys of America's true icons and offers up zillions of interesting sidetracks along the way.He doesn't mince too many words when disclosing the nitty gritty opinions that each of the protagonists has of one another - this makes for a more interesting read than many works which simply glorify all their subjects.Additionally, somehow the author has an uncanny finger on the pulse of what we really want to hear about on the way, such as the piece on James Dean - his significance and his death. The section on Hunter S. Thompson is a riot!!!This is a nice addition to your psychedelic editions."
5,Icons of the '60s,The author writes engagingly about his visits with 7 prominent figures from the '60's. Very entertaining and informative personal look as Whitmer often meets his subjects in their homes and describes personal details.
5,hidden murder and hidden love,"The impossible love affair that never quite surfaces between the two major characters, the mystery of whodunnit, and the romance of the historical post Civil War era Boston setting make this well written and readable book a delight. Each in the series draws the reader further in to the lives of Nell, Will and Gracie. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
4,Blindsided......,"That's how I felt. I finally picked out the guilty party JUST before the reveal, however, the reason was a total blind side. The hints were all there, but you get so engrossed in the storyline you forget that you should be solving the mystery. Another very good story from P B Ryan."
4,Very good!,"I got the first of this series when it was on the top 100 free downloads. And I have enjoyed every single one of them, still need to read the last one in the series."
3,Wonderful Series,"I would rate this book at 3.5 stars. Although I am very much enjoying this series to date, for me, however this is probaly the weakest book regading plot in the series so far. The author has again managed to convey a wonderful feeling for time and place. I won't go into the synopsis as it has already been attended to. The series to date, continues to be well plotted and the writing excellent. I am really enjoying the progression of the relationship that has been slowly and surely developing between Nell and Will. These two characters are extremely well fleshed out, and are a joy to read about.The series is well worth reading and excellent value for money. Time well spent in my opinion."
5,Great series,I loved this series. The story is well written and the characters as so well depicted. Any one of the books could stand alone but as a series they are top notch.
4,Nice movie but what is the deal?,I remember this movie from when I was a kid. I haven't seen the new widescreen release yet but I did just order it. What I'm wondering is why the price is so high here? I managed to search for it on Google and find a well known site where a new copy was available for under $20 (after tax and shipping).
2,slippery when wet,"Despite the ""lugged outsole"" of this shoe, after having worn it on the wet streets of seattle, they are VERY slick on smooth concrete. BE CAREFUL!!!"
5,Wonderful devotional!!,"Joni writes from the heart and it shows in her devotional. Most days the topics deal with reflections of everyday people. But her way of looking at them and how they relate to the days scripture, will warm your heart. Nothing deep, just inspiring, like Joni!!"
4,Joni's First Devotional book,"When a young family member died, I began looking for writers that were ""real"", ""genuine"". People who lived through bad, bad days when their faith was challenged.Joni is someone who is very real and transparent about her struggles with faith in a God that allows ""bad things"" to happen to you and they aren't miraculously cured like Job who got everything he lost and more returned. People like Joni never get back what they lost, but as she tells you in these daily meditations she received much much more. This occurred during and after her inner transformance in her relationship with God. An excellent book for people with Back Injuries, Chronic Pain, Fibromyalgia, TMJ, etc. More so if they were Christians before the condition."
5,Have read this one at least 3 times.,I love the way Joni thinks and expresses herself. I am a retired rehab. nurse and I recognize so many of her thoughts and feelings in patients I have known. Have also given this for a gift and my friend read it 2 years in a row as a daily devotional. Great book.
2,Horrible hardware and gaskets,"I bought one of these and I was so excited. I ran the car up on the lift to let the gaskets burn in, I tightened everything down again and they leaked 2 days later. The flange where it meets up with the mid-pipes has studs, the studs do not have a socket adapter on the end to run them in tight. When you install them there is a bolt that will not go in because the tube is in the way, it should be slotted to slide it on. I finally put a tubular k-member in my mustang so every time the headers leak I can work it without pulling my engine."
5,Killer show,Gomi and Baroni just rock the house in this show. Some great fights. Definately a good show and worth the dough.
5,HUGE Syleena Fan,I recently heard this remix and it's awesome! I am so surprised at Syleena's PR management because she isn't promoted at all. Where is Syleena? I am still waiting on her to go tour now that she has 2 albums under her belt. She and R. Kelly have a great chemistry together and he can truly write the best songs or remixes for Syleena! 5 stars!!
1,Outdated; should not be sold anymore,"I don't think this is a bad collection of articles. However, its contents are no longer relevant today. The book opens with the announced merger of AOL and Time Warner, hailing it as a great development. We now know how spectacularly that deal collapsed. The article then continues with a discussion of how M&A; is 'different' in the internet age, and how this justifies ever larger takeover sums. Worldcom is then given as an example; another icon of the excesses of the internet boom that imploded. Participant in the opening discussion is Dennis Kozlowski, who is now serving eight to twenty-five years in prison for his role in the Tyco scandals.I admit, all of this is entertaining enough from a historical perspective. However, it should be beneath Harvard Business Review to keep on milking no longer relevant content for a few extra dollars profit at airports, college bookstores etc."
5,The Beginning of an Era,"Most Stones fans and critics state Beggars Banquet as the start of the bands grand era but actually it was this album. Satanic Majesties Request which followed it up in 1967 is noted as the Stones DRug effort but this is not true. Buttons was recorded during Oct/Nov '66 and to all accounts was nothing less than an all out party night and day with LSD and reefers. The studio was packed with who's who of the era,Jimmy Page,Jimi Hendrix,McCartney,you name 'em they were partyin with the Stones.Musically its one of their best mixing Tudor English foundations and the much loved Jagger Sarcasim whilst surrounding it all with an LSD tainted aura.Look at the cover,Charlie Watts was quoted,"" We were woke at 3 a.m. givin a hit of acid and then woke again hours later to do the photo shoot.""This is definitly the album that began the Grand Era of the sado freak band we came to love. Buttons to Exile,Stones st their best!"
4,Between the Buttons,"This ws a very favorable purchase. I have received dvds in the past which did not play at all . This order came on time, in good condition and plays well"
3,Experimentando con nuevas cosas,"En este disco, los Stones buscan experimentar nuevas cosas y escapan un poco de sus raices bluseras. La primera vez que lo escuche no me gusto en lo absoluto, salvo las conocidas ""Let Spend the Night Together"" y ""Ruby Tuesday"", pasaron varias veces hasta que pudiera adaptarme un poco al mismo (estoy tan acostumbrado al Stone tipico de ""Beggars Banquet"", ""Let It Bleed"" y ""Sticky Fingers"" que de verdad cuesta adaptarse al cambio). ""Between The Buttons"" es mucho mas que esas dos canciones, ""Miss Amanda Jones"" es una especie de Rock and Roll bastante aceptable y ni hablar de ""Something Happened to Me Yesterday"" a mi juicio, lo mejor del disco. Si buscas Stones clásico, te equivocaste de disco, pero si quieres tener una muestra de los experimentos de ellos en los 60 ""para muestra un boton""."
4,different is good,"Very different sound compared to 1970s era Stones. Gentler and more folk influence on some songs. Odd instruments like xylophone on others. You won't hear these songs on the radio, so they're often surprisingly good."
2,nothing moves me here,Stones are superior - on and off during their career. This collection didn't have anything worth paying for. Wish I'd heard it somewhere first and saved my money...
2,IT'S REALLY PRETTY FORGETTABLE,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT I PICKED UP AT A USED RECORD STORE,TOOK IT HOME,PLAYED IT AND TRIED TO LIKE IT,THEN GAVE IT AWAY.THE TWO WELL KNOWN SONGS,LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT AND RUBY TUESDAY,ARE AVAILABLE ON FLOWERS AND HOT ROCKS,WHICH I RECOMEND OVER THIS.THE REST IS JUST BASICALLY FORGETTABLE,LIKE THERE JUST WASEN'T MUCH EFFORT PUT INTO THIS.ABOUT AS EXITING AS A PIECE OF MILKTOAST,SORRY TO SAY."
2,British version,This version of the album does not include 'Let's spend the night together' or 'Ruby Tuesday'. Pretty disappointing. Other than that it sounds fine. Digital remastering does not seem to have hurt it.
5,"Versitle, Innovative & Ageless","Just another album? I do not think so. Between The Buttons is testimony to the endless talent of the Stones. Departing from their harder, blues driven rock, this work shows their versitility in music making. All Sold Out, Complicated & Amanda Jones are just but a few of the great tunes on this album. No, these songs did not make it to the Top 20, but that was probably not the plan anyway. The Stones were pushing the envelope and finding new ways to make their music last well into the 21st Century. Long after the Beatles had used up their creative genus, The Rolling Stones pushed on. ""Between The Buttons"" is a Beatlesque work that the Liverpool Boys wish they had made. It is no accident that the Stones are older than most of the parents of the reviewers seen here. Albums like this insured their survivability and made the Stones acceptable to larger audiences. ""Between The Buttons"" in a Keystone work from the Stones. To not have it is to not have a collection!!"
3,too moch detail,"When he writes of the initial U-Boat attcks inside the harbors of Aruba and Curacao it was exciting and interesting. The attack and defense of Trinidad was good. But the detail of U-Boat numbers, locations names of captains, names and sizes of ships sunk is challengeing to understand.It becomes an historical record, albeit a very good, detailed one. But for the ordinary reader with a passing interest in U-Boat activity in the Caribbean during WWll it's too much detail. Taking maybe 10 submarines, operating in different areas of the Caribbean and describing in detail their activity would have been more interesting to me."
3,Pricey but works as intended,"Wish I would have looked locally for this product. They sell them at Lowes and Home Deport for $1.50, you just have to know where to look. Bought this one before my contractor told me I could have bought 3 for the price I paid."
2,Horrible laugh track,"I've read a number of reviews of this, and I am left wondering if I saw the same episode as others have who reviewed it so glowingly. I like Martin Clunes, whose presence in this attracted me to it, but the laugh track is so intrusive - even by American sitcom standards - that I called it quits after this episode."
3,it's an ok toy,"Honestly I thought I was getting the Play Arts Kai Square Enix figure when I bought this. This is the older model so naturally it's ""less"" than what I was expecting.The toy is durable, comes with plenty of accessories (extra arms, hands, a lance) so it is more child friendly. The downside is it's not super pose-able as the one I was expecting. It also looks cheaper than the newer model, but that cannot be helped it is an older model after all."
4,From an FMA Fan!!!,I really love this product i really a huge fan and have been very happy wih adding this addition to my collection. It was really a bargin and worth the buy for an FMA fan!!!
4,Before the storm,"This is the 1962 Dover-reprint of the work first published by Harper & Br. (1948). Essentially a catalogue of Chinese furniture photographed in Peking in 1937-1938. Starting off with an introduction of some 60 pages, George N.Kates presents 112 pieces of furniture, each by a black&white photograph and a short description. If nothing else this book shows that the Chinese certainly made beautiful and interesting furniture."
4,Charming Tea Kettle,"This kettle is just adorable! It is very cheerful and looks great in the kitchen. The whistle really does sound like a train but the water has to be REALLY boiling in order for it to whistle. Be patient & you should enjoy this sound. Mine came with a flaw in the finish, but not bad enough to return it. One negative - opening the spout to pour the water is a little difficult because you have to touch the hot whistle to open it. Other than that, this is a very lovable tea kettle."
1,disappointed,tea kettle did not whistle. Need whistling teapot because I tend to forget it's on. Returned item immediately.
3,Pretty but not a perfect teakettle,"This teakettle is certainly attractive and fits in nicely with our kitchen decor, but the spout starts a bit too low so that you really have to be careful filling the kettle. If you fill it up to anywhere near the bottom of the spout which starts less than halfway up the kettle, the water will come out the spout when it starts to boil. Also, it has a very weird ""whistle"" when the water boils - it sounds like a train whistle. Our cats go a little crazy when they hear it. I think I prefer the more usual whistle in my teakettle."
4,"Charming kettle, unusual whistle, great handle, takes a little longer to heat","This is a very charming kettle, both in appearance and in the way the whistle sounds. It's very hard to describe, but the whistle is unlike any other kettle I've heard and is a hit with me, my wife and my 9 year old daughter. Two other points worth making are:1. The handle gets warm but remains cool enough to hold2. When filled to its maximum, it takes about 10 min on my gas range to boil. This is a bit longer than other kettles, I think, presumably because of the enamel finish, and this is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars"
2,"Cute, but broke","This kettle arrived and seemed perfectly fine, it looked exactly like it did in the picture and boiled water with no problems. However, the whistle is decidedly creepy; it sounds like a ghostly train approaching from a distance. Also, the handle is on hinges and often made me nervous pouring the tea (nothing ever happened). However, I was forced to get rid of the teapot when the enamel on the bottom started coming off in flakes and getting all over the stove. I had only owned the teapot for about three months, if that."
2,Not warm enough for winter,"SSG Pro Show Leather Winter Riding GlovesThese gloves are soft and comfortable, but not warm enough when it gets below freezing. They would be better marketed as cool weather gloves."
1,Disappointed in OK,"It was hours before the thermometer dial adjusted ten degrees, and then the temperature remained inaccurate. The unprotected backing exposes the cardboard face to the elements. I sent it back for a refund."
1,Had to return,The hands of the clock would get stuck on the temp or humidity hands. Had to send back.
2,Keeps Time!!,"Very attractive unit, clock works fine. Temp. and humidity not even close to actual weather readings, but it keeps good time."
1,Chaney Instrument Pewter Clock/Thermometer/Hygrometer,"I hate to give bad reviews - but this is poorly made; inaccurate in all readings except clock, but that stopped running because the minute hand gotstuck on the temperature gage hand. If manufacturer did some quality control and used accurate components it would probably be a great item.The ONLY thing going for it is that it LOOKS GOOD hanging on your wall. But don't trust a darned thing it indicates!"
5,Awesome Finnish Cookbook!,I loved this book! I wanted to explore more of my Finnish cultural background and this book is perfect. I love the information about Finland and its people. The recipes are wonderful. My daughter and I made some of the baked goods for Christmas and they were delicious. We loved learning more about our heritage. The book is great!
2,Too old,"I didn't find this book very useful maybe because it is too old and it has not been updated for quite a long time. However, there are other books on the market which can be very useful and helpful."
2,Too old,I didn't find this book very helpful maybe because it was written too long ago and since then it has not been updated. However there are better books out there which may be rather useful.
4,"good price, fast service","My only concern is that nothing is said about where the product comes from. Reishi that is gathered wild is probably the most expensive. Of the cultivated kind there are 2 categories, the kind grown on dongwood & the kind grown on sawdust, which is usually the cheapest but is less effective. From your information nothing is said about the source of the product, so I'm assuming that it is just the kind grown on sawdust."
2,short life,"these only lasted 1 year. not good quality, fuses and bulbs burn out too quick. would not recommend to anyone"
4,great hair dryer,Hair dryer works great. It is perfect for blowouts. The only thing is it gets very hot so you have to be careful.
2,Good.. for a few months,I ordered this hair dryer in December. It is now August first and I just ordered a new dryer. This dryer worked well and it dried my hair in a reasonable time (I have thick semi wavy hair). But after 9 months it has basically died. It only works when I hold it in certain positions. I am assuming it has to do with the cord but that has been untwisted. I am dissapointed.
2,"Fine, until it broke","This hair dryer was alright, not really fantastic. It dried my hair, not sure if it added shine or whatever since I've been switching styling products. After 18 months, it broke. Something went wrong with the wiring. At first I could use it if I held the cord a certain way, but after a few days of this, it went completely kaput. Aside from this, the dryer is VERY heavy and this became even more apparent after I purchased a new, much lighter product. Overall, there are many better hair dryers out there, and in general, I am not so impressed with the whole Ionic/Ceramic technology."
3,"Andis 82320 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer, Blue","It's not as light as I thought it would be, and it's quite loud. I have trouble hearing my clients while using the dryer. It's ok I don't love it, but it does what it needs to."
3,Cord broken,"Bought this for a Xmas present for my wife. She is pretty happy with it so far. The cord broke internally near the base of the dryer handle after 10 months of use. Luckily the cord on this dryer is extremely long, so it was no problem to cut the cord at the base and reattach."
2,There is a much better choice ......,This book is good only if you are not. The book <Quantitative Seismology> by Aki & Richards is much better for a good seismologist.
3,Received product with defect,"I received the wraps with a pretty major problem on one of the wraps, fabric was all messed up. Don't know how they let something like that slip through QA. Going to be generous and give it 3 stars anyway, because they are nice wraps and most people seem to be receiving good ones. Just a heads up about possible QA issues.If not for the issues would rate 4 star - very comfortable, long, work well."
4,Motivated People Move Faster,"Leigh Branham has done an admirable job writing a practical manual for keeping good employees. I believe any employer will find scores of proven tactics they can apply at once. As Joe Bosch of Pizza Hut says: ""If a company implemented just four or five of these practices, they would be significantly better at retaining talent."" Gee. Making more money because your employees are motivated. What a concept.Doni Tamblyn is author ofLaugh and Learn: 95 Ways to Use Humor for More Effective Teaching and TrainingandThe Big Book of Humorous Training Games (Big Book of Business Games Series)"
4,Insightful!,"If you are fed up with recruiting, training and motivating new employees only to see them ride off into the sunset, you probably need to re-think some of your basic approaches to running your business. You can emerge a winner in the now fully joined war for great talent - the inevitable collision of a low unemployment rate with the corporate world's growing need for skilled workers. Management consultant Leigh Branham has written a lively, thorough guide to keeping great employees. Her book, which is a pleasure to read, is filled with plenty of sound, usable advice and examples from large and small companies. No matter what your industry is or how big your company might be, her guidance is likely to help you keep your best people longer. We [...] recommend this book to executives and managers. Read it before your competition does."
5,Great teacher resource,"First year teachers and experienced teachers alike will gain valuable skills from this richly detailed book. Denton and Kriete provide explict plans for the first six weeks of school which are guaranteed to build a sense of community within any classroom. Activities including games and writing help students become familiar with each other and develop a sense of trust, caring and respect. The book offers teachers a wide variety of games to play with children of all ages. This is a great book for all teachers who wish to start the year on a great note!"
4,Good suggestions for new and experienced teachers,"Two weeks in to my 8th year of teaching, and I am using many ideas from this book. It really helps set a positive tone and reminds the teacher to spend the first few weeks modeling desired outcomes with the help from the students. Although I am not folowing it to a tee, the book is set up with down to the minute lessons plans, which could really be a bonus for a new teacher. I think this book would be helpful for both a new and experienced teacher!"
3,Very detailed plan for the first six weeks of school,This book provides exactly what it says it will. It gives you a week-by-week schedule for all elementary grade levels and the rationale behind doing each thing. This would be really helpful to have before the first week of your first year teaching.
5,A Must-Have Book for Teachers,I purchased this book after attending the Responsive Classroom Workshop. It gets used quite a bit. The book really spells out helpful beginning of the year activities for grades K-2 and 3-6. I use it to plan before school starts and then constantly during the first six weeks. This is one of my favorites and I give it to all of my student teachers to help them when they have their own classroom.
2,cultural clashes are presented in the book,"In this novel, we can see the conflicts between eastern and weatern cultures.We can see them just throuigh the description of the mothers and daughter. On the one hand,mothers were greatly influenced by the Chinese culture and tradition, they try to adjust themselves to the western culture. On the other hand, the daughters were brought up in the west, they are deeply influenced by the western culture, they sometimes can not understand their mothers. While we can also find the impact of eastern culture on them."
2,Pass on This One!,"I purchased this book after reading the ""To Be a Naval Aviator"" book hoping it would be as good as the other book but I was disppointed. The pictures are good, however, the lengths the authors go to cater to political correctness spoil its content. Instead of covering the process to become a USAF pilot, the book pretty much summerizes the efforts of this branch of the military to promote diversity in pilot training.If you desire to get a good perspective on military pilot training, read the Naval Aviator book from the same series. It is written by a Naval Aviator in layman's terms and describes the process from start to finish in each of the Navy's avaition ""pipelines""."
3,Very Ordinary Travel Guide,"Despite the title, there's nothing especially ""hidden"" in this book. It is a tolerably-good guide to Maui, but nothing special. Most everything in it can be found in any decent guide to the island."
2,older edition,"This edition seemed to be an earlier one than the book we checked out at the library. The library one seemed to have more current information, and the print was somewhat larger (which is helpful for us older folks). We are going to Maui soon and we won't even be taking this book. We will be taking Maui Revealed instead.You never know till you try."
5,Great,I used these rails to extend the surface of the saw so I can make wider cuts. They fit perfect and require very little tools
1,3-Piece set of Casual by Paul Sebastian,"While the product was labeled ""New"", it was old in that the spray, the lotion, and the shower gel are yellowish and strong-smelling as opposed to clear or white and fresh-smelling.I purchased a lot of this item, for years, until it became difficult to impossibe to find, and whenever I wore it, it always brought compliments whenever I came into the general vacinity of friends and strangers alike. It was a wonderful fragrance and I just do not understand why it went off the market!I have been planning to return the purchase, but just have not yet had the time to repackage it for return."
2,Nothing particularly interesting,"I'm a longtime fan of Top Gear. This episode had nothing the show is known for. No humor. No interesting challenges. No great back-and-forth dialogue between Hammonds, May, and Clarkson. Just really dry and a waste of an hour listening to three men talk about cars that were new back in 2006."
5,"Pappy's Sassafras tea from Amazon, tastes wonderful.","Got the Pappy's Sassafras tea in short amount of time, it tastes wonderful, I'm very happy with the tea and the handling."
5,Sassafras Concentrate,"1. Same product I get from the health store, but more convenient to order and about the same price."
4,Great and Convenient,"I love Root Beer, but I don't want sugar or artificial sweeteners in my diet. Pappy's Sassafras gives me just enough flavoring in my water to subdue my need for Root Beer. I've been tempted to drink it straight from the bottle because using it as directed seems pretty dilluted, but I figure our taste buds have been ruined by soft drinks and other over sweetened drinks."
5,Excellant Product at a reasonable price,"I've used this excellent quality product for years, and find it to be one of the best of its kind. The company also sells other concentrates (green tea) which I hope Amazon will start carrying also."
2,Nothing like the real McCoy...,"My daughter likes it but she's never had the real thing...taste too much like root beer barrel candy which is horrid in my opinion. Real Sassafras tea, the kind my Grandmother and I made by taking the bark of a Sassafras tree and boiling in water which makes a reddish, fragrant and pleasant tasting tea is much better tasting and nothing like what Pappy's taste like."
3,Memories from years ago,"I used to buy sassafras tea from Hickory farms every year and it was excellent. Lawfully for health reasons, they had to remove some ingredient that made it sooo good.This tea is tasty but not as tasty as it would be with the prohibited ingredient.Susgar brings out more flavor. To me anyway.The product arrived fast and efficiently and excellent shape."
5,Best fight show of 2005,"This event featured enough big name fights to even excite a casual Pride fan. If you like stand-up fighting, Cro-Cop vs. Hunt is a display of two of the best in all of MMA. If you want to see the best fighter in MMA destroy somebody, watch Fedor vs. Zuluzinho. Three championship bouts take place in the lower weight divisions, Henderson vs. Bustamante, Gomi vs. Sakurai, and Arona vs. Wanderlei. Round this out with two all Japanese rockstar battles in Minowa vs. Sakuraba and Ogawa vs. Yoshida and the freak show between Giant Silva vs. Thompson and the ever entertaining Charles Bennett and this DVD is a can't miss."
2,Buy the used one!!!,"MovieMars has always been a 5 star seller. I think THEY were cheated with the new ones, which do not have the full tape!!!! It ends abruptly with German surrender, and one doesn't see the Russian, nor the edding credits.This might explain why the used are more expensive than the new."
5,The best of Alex Haley!!!!,"This is a thoroughly covered book, and a tear dropper at the end. Alex Haley done a slendid job with covering the life of Malcom X. And Alex was deeply inspired by the encounter that he had with malcom X. He covered Malcom's life in a way that cannot be duplicated. This is an excellant book, and a must read!!!"
4,All those blinded by The Nation Of Islam must Read this book,"In short, it reveals the complexities of a man who has been shunned by the mainstream as a race baiter. He is instead a person who came to grips of his own humanity early and one who entered the Nation of Islam welled up with hatred of all who were not Black and disenfrancised. His life's journey took him from street hoodlum to religous icon, he then came to the point where he became a liability to the Nation because he was, in short blowing thier game. You really should read this book."
5,Great Book,"I believe that Malcolm X's life and story was put on this earth to inspire blacks all over the world to motivate themselves for equality but I also have discontent after reading this book because imagine if men like Malcom X and Dr. King were living today? Mannnn,, it feels like such a loss.....even though I was not of that time and haven't experienced blatant racism as our forefathers experienced back in the 40's and 50's, I still can feel the weight of it on my shoulders and there are no leaders like them today that inspire change, because we are content and think the struggle is over but its not, take a walk in places like liberty city and harlem and see that we're still suffereing horribly. I hated the ending because I know that it ended abruptly, just like the life of Malcom X and it left such an empty feeling inside but I understand the impact of the ending. Great book, every black person and person rather should read this book.."
5,An insight into a hero,I love this book not only because Malcolm X was a fascinating person but because it gives the reader a true insight into the man. Many other autobiographies I have read have seemed a little false at times but this one doesn't. It represents the personality of the man behind the book and allows the reader to glimpse his strengths and weaknesses. I think any person could enjoy and learn from this book regardless of their opinion of Malcolm X and the movements that he represented.
5,A must read!,"Without a doubt, a must read for every college student in America. This book took me through so many emotions and made great points. Malcolm X's life has come full circle because of so many things he fought for we have in our hands now. But WE as blacks have not embraced our opportunity so we can't excel the way we should. This is a book that all should enjoy."
4,Malcolm X,"""America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered 'white'-but the 'white' attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brother hood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color."" These are the words of Malcolm X, published in his autobiography. This quote sums up his ideas at the end of the book, showing what it took him his entire life to conclude. Throughout the book, his thoughts on race relations continuously change, this being the constant theme of the book. The story evolves realistically and with a lot of things to hold the attention of the reader. Although the book is potentially offensive at times, all in all, it's worth it."
5,words of wisdom,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. All students, teachers, and others should be required to read this autobiography."
5,One of my favorite books of all-time,"This is a must-read for everyone (black or white) 'cuz it changed my life completely since I seen the movie, watch documentaries about him and then learn more about him.As you know, Malcolm X is one of my heroes of all-time even though he had a powerful message since Martin Luther King did ""I Have A Dream"" speech is 1963. This is sumthin u shouldn't hate about or u think is racist enuff or sumthin. I don't call it by that. I call a more mature book that has the basic details that what's going in our community and the culture we live in today.Many of us who are sacrificing and showing mercy among ourselves to this book or the man behind himself must read this book. This is really a study guide to talk about our community. Spike Lee does a good job on this movie he did from the book. And I thank God he'll live and learn 2 this day.R.I.P. Malcolm X your legacy lives on between us."
5,The Truth,"Malcom was a lover, teller and seeker of truth. Some of the Buffy from Toldedo, Ohio-type reviewers have a problem with his honest assessments of the evil white people have done in this country but for the rest of you who like Malcolm love and are seeking the truth, this book will make an impact on your thinking."
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS!,"i'll admit the begging of the book is alright....but i'm in the middle, and i can barely finish going...This book is a great way to promote white racism...page after page of the white man being the devil...you can sum up the book thus far in a simple sentence...""Malcom does drugs, finds ""Allah,"" and hates white people."""
5,Malcolm X; The real story from a real source,"Many people know too little about Malcolm X, and what they know is usally one sided or incorrect. This book which is brilliantly written presents the whole life of Malcolm X. It starts from when he was a child facing the racism from locals and the KKK ,and getting sent to a foster home,on through his hustler years and onto become one of the strongest voices in the African American struggle for human and civil rights. Not only does this book captivate the reader but it will present you with a new idea of American history and culture. This is a must read for anyone wanting to find out about one of the strongest voices during the 1960's and to learn more about the all too real problems the were and still are in American today."
5,Use this great man's life as a guideline for yours.,This book is proof that as individuals we can accomplish anything if we put the utmost effort into it. Malcolm X hits rock bottom and turns his life around by self-discipline and an unwavering belief in a higher power. He goes from having a self-estimated working vocabulary of not more than a few hundred words to becoming the most powerful speaker I have ever heard. He does this by reading and more reading. He is continually learning and most importantly growing as a person. Malcolm X is proof that sheer willpower and dedication to your cause will make us all better human beings.
5,The Autobiography of Malcolm X is incredible!,"The Autobiography of Malcolm X is the best boook that I have ever read, being an African-American woman I see many things that Malcolm X has said to be true. It opened my eyes and made me view the world differently, I now have a better understanding of my purpose as an African-American!!!!"
3,See the Movie,"Looking back, after reading this book, I notice that Malcolm X was a very interesting man with a very interesting life. However, the book itself is definitely not thrilling, it's long, it drags on, and there are many unneeded things. Malcolm X had a controversial, but interesting life, but you could easily learn about it by watching the movie while saving a BUNCH of time."
3,"""It was good but it could of been better!""","The Autobiography of Malcolm X was one of the greatest ""stories"" ever told. But I tend to agree with a previous reviewer, saying that you can save your time by just seeing the movie. I'm more of a movie person anyway, but if you were to experience them both I think you would feel the same. The book wasn't all that bad; it got into depth about his early life as a numbers running thug, to his imprisonment for burglary, to his conversion to the nation of Islam. But the movie had much more to offer mentally and emotionally. The movie gave off a vibe that would make anyone an admirer of Malcolm X. I think Spike Lee directed the movie perfectly and Denzel Washington played Malcolm's part perfect. But I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to spend days and days reading this book if you have the opportunity to see the movie. I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
2,Max Notes: The Autobiography of Malcom X,"I must have clicked on the wrong item, because I did NOT purposely order Max Notes. I already have two Master's Degrees and a year of Law School. So, I do not need ""notes."""
5,"Because of this tape, I'm buying an cassette player","I have iPods and a Kindle but nothing beats cassette tapes. The minute I got the tapes I put one in my bed side stereo, kick it up full power and there was a slight wobble in the beginning but it smoothed out and the sound was sweet and pure. I'm 20th and 21st Century person. I have a record player that I record on tape and on to my computer. I am pleased with my purchase and I'm glad I getting a cassette player.I feel special! Thank You isn't enough but Thank you! 6 stars!"
2,"Autobiography of Malcolm X, Maxnotes Literature Guide","I made a mistake in buying this book. I did not notice the ""literature guide"" part. I was looking for the main book, which I first read in 1978. So the error was mine, I believe."
3,Malcolm X,"This is the best book I have ever read. It changed my life. Every person - black, white, rich, poor - should read this book."
2,a lifetime spent learning the obvious,"First of all, what kind of autobiography is written by someone other than the subject of the autobiography? That would be like me writing the autobiography of President Clinton. The proper word here is biography NOT autobiography. Poor Malcom. He spends an entire life learning the obvious. I was not impressed. Of course, anger is a dead end. Of course, the Muslims aren't all they would like us to think they are. Of course, a life of petty crime is a dead end. If he had actually shut up for a while and listened to other people, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble, and maybe still be alive. But some people are so dense they will not listen but need to hit their heads against the wall over and over again. These are the unteachable ones who need to reinvent the wheel rather than borrow it."
5,Good and great to have it. Excellent !,Good and great to have it. Excellent !Good and great to have it. Excellent !Good and great to have it. Excellent !Good and great to have it. Excellent !
3,My mistake,"I didn't read the description of this book properly. I didn't realise I was buying the ""Notes"" and not the book and the notes. My fault, should've paid attention to the description. Had the actual book before but can't find it so I'll have to buy it again."
5,This was a great man...,"I am white, and this book was very hard for me to read at times. But I cannot continue to overlook the racial problems that continue to plague our country.The media seems to tell us the our racial problems or largely resolved, but ask any person of color, and they will tell you that they are not.There continues to be a ""white ceiling"" in our country. Whites continue to have a privilege that they are oblivious to, at the cost of Blacks and other members of minority races.Yes, Malcom was at times bitter against all white people for the incredibly heinous oppression his people have suffered (and continue to suffer) at the hands of people of my race. But his voice must be heard. There is much truth in what he says. Until every white person is willing to face these truths and do something to stop the ""silent"" oppression of minorities, we are nourishing the seeds of anger and destruction in our communities and in our nation.This book affected me deeply. I highly recommend it."
5,Required reading,"It's hard to put into words how good and how important this book is. I began the book with a conception of Malcolm X as a black supremacist, anti-white demagogue. Several chapters in, as he described his childhood and the violent murder of his father at the hands of white men, I began to understand his anger, though I was still put off by his misogyny.But about halfway through the book the character of this man, his compassion for the downtrodden African American in society, his tenacious search for truth, and his willingness to ""speak truth to power"" really won me over.What impressed me even more were the changes in his ideology and views on interracial relations that happened toward the end of his life. Surprising, especially given his reputation (not always deserved) as the angry face of the civil rights movement.He was and is so much more than that. This book should be required reading for every student and every leader in North American society."
5,absolutely fascinating,"This book is great on two levels: As a person, Malcolm X led an extraordinary life, and that alone is worth picking this book up. But the social commentary provided by Malcolm himself and by Alex Haley makes it that much better."
5,Powerful and inspirational,This book describes the life and beliefs of a forgotten hero of the civil rights movement. I think it was an excellent book to read and one of the few that tell it like it is.
4,A real eye-opener to anyone who thought they knew who X was!,"It was amazing to read such a fully formed (and true) story of anger, betrayal, and change. Very few readers of my generation know much about the man known as Malcolm X, and this book tells all, from early childhood to death. Alex Haley did an outstanding job of transforming interview notes into a first-person autobiographical account."
4,The Mystery of Orchids,"This book delves into the history of orchids and their rise in popularity. Some of the topics covered include the culinary uses of orchids, orchids in literature and orchid lore involving religion.There are several chapters covering historical aspects of several of the most popular orchid families. The final chapter gives a brief rundown of orchid culture today.My favorites in this book are any of the marvelous line drawings of orchid plants and flowers. There are also several color plates included.I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in orchid lore and legends."
3,not for the scholar,"I liked this book. Its wide-ranging accounts of orchids in history was very interesting. The book's one, and serious, flaw is that there are no footnotes. There is a vague bibliography, but standard footnoting would be really appreciated for people who would like to use this as a scholarly reference. As it stands, they can't. A lot of work went into collecting the stories for the book; and it's a shame that that bit of extra detail wasn't included because it would expand its usefulness immeasurably!"
5,A wonderful introduction.,"Even 47 years after this album (and its British counterpart the Rolling Stones) was released it still a really great listen, and an a great introduction to Rolling Stones earlier work not a one of the greatest Rock and Roll band to have come out of England but as one of the greatest Blues-Rock covers. They really did a wonderful job of taking some really great American Blues records and making them there own. And for beginning songwriters the three songs by the now renown team and Jagger and Richards are simply superb one of them Little by Little is one of my favorite tracks by them. Tracks from this album to check out are Route 66, I Just Wanna Make Love to You, Little By Little, and Not Fade Away (which is not included in the original it takes the place of I Need You Baby (Mona)."
3,"love the stones, hate rip off's","Thank mike-on-the-mike for your review. I was thinking I was the only frustrated stones fan that wanted all the early songs without buying so many cd's that constantly overlap the same songs. And with today's cd technology, something special should be done for such a special band like the stones. Give us more for the buck then just 30 minutes on a cd AND then repeat some of the same songs on the next cd (i.e. Between The Buttons & Flowers). What a rip off. I will pay good money for something like a Rolling Stones Box Set (6 or 7 cd's), of simply the first songs released before mid 1967. The LP'S DON'T MEAN A THING. WHAT MATTERS ARE THE SONGS. I WANT THE SONGS ON CD, WITHOUT BUYING SO MANY LP'S ON CD."
2,Overrated,This was supposed to be one of the best Stones albums. Sucks. If you love the stones you'll probably like it though. I'm shocked at how bad of a singer Mick is.
4,nice quality!,I really hated by the switch covers because of the cost. I did save money not going to Home Depot though and happy with my purchase. item arrived in mint codition and fairly fast! Seems to be a nice product and better then regular plastic switch plate.
3,The product itself is great,"Good solid well-made wallplate. Nice finish, good packaging, no scratches. However, what I ordered was stainless steel to match appliances. What arrived was blue."
3,its black,"its a black light switch cover, it comes with two screws. enough said. I could not be more indifferent about it."
4,Suicide of a Child,"I read the pamphlet, but mainly I wanted to pass it on to a friend whose 27 yr old daughter suicided. A book that got closer to what I was looking for is called: ""The Eagle and The Rose"" by Rosemary Altea. It supported at an emotional level that there is live after death and my friend would see his daughter again."
3,Another fun romp through CAMP BLOOD!,What can you say? Nothing's better than watching pretty girls run through the woods while being chased by a big nasty killer clown! This isn't a big budget adventure - but as long as you go in knowing that it's a fun and campy story - well... then it WILL indeed be a fun and campy movie! The gals are hot... and you just can't help but give a little cheer each time someone who deserves it gets all slashed up... Relax... enjoy it! I did...
1,"Can you smell that? We must be ""Within the Woods""...","If you want to see a really scary, well produced horror movie, stay away from this one. The director must have thought ripping off other horror movies done much better was some kind of homage but it's not. The cast does the best they can, although the lead actress's greatest talents lie hidden underneath her shirt, and we're not even given the pleasure of a glimpse (nice going brainiac). The scene at the end in the control room was unintentionally hilarious, when the guy gets his hand chopped off by the killer clown and screams, you'll scream too... with laughter.As cheesy as this movie is it does have some entertainment value if you want a laugh, when you're done watching it, the DVD makes a nice drink coaster."
5,Lively and entertaining...and historical,"Odiaga's playing is very bright and lively, and reflects the joy that Haydn expressed in his compositions.I was surprised at the amount of color that Odiaga is able to bring forth from the model fortepiano. It's interesting to hear the pieces played as they might have been heard back in Haydn's time.But this isn't simply a historical curiosity; the CD is rewarding on a purely musical enjoyment level and highly recommended."
2,Too many errors,"The layout of the book is nice: each chapter begins with a reading and analysis of the text and then continues with further grammatical explanations and cultural notes. For someone who just wants to review the basics of Spanish for informal use, this book is probably sufficient. However, it is filled with too many errors to be of much help to someone who wants to make a serious effort to learn grammatically correct Spanish. There are minor mistakes throughout, and the explanations of preterite vs. imperfect and the uses of the subjunctive contain significant inaccuracies."
2,Idiot's Intermediate Spanish,"If you want to learn about Spanish culture, this book will be somewhat useful in learning some statistics. Unfortunately, it is also loaded with chauvanistic comments about how superior the Latino culture is and how friendly, polite, helpful they invariable are despite the fact that there are cities decimated by killing gnags in Mexico, some of the countries are ruled by dictators, and poverty abounds. Books on Spanish should be about the language, not attempts at brainwashing.If you can get past the propaganda, there are some useful analyses of the readings in this book. If you hope to come away from reading this book having the knowledge to move on to the advanced level of Spanish, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed."
3,The folk in a new package,"The CD contains the following songs:1 ""What's it Gonna Take"" 03:552 ""When the Morning Comes"" 04:543 ""Nadine"" 03:324 ""Mother"" 03:415 ""Something Missing"" 03:566 ""Not Nearly Close"" 02:417 ""Feel the Rain"" 04:068 ""Enough of this Game"" 03:169 ""Because of You"" 02:4710 ""Seven Times in Three Days"" 03:1911 ""Next Big Thing"" 02:47"
5,if you want to know more about them get this book know!,"This is the best book i have ever read.It tells you everything you need to know about Backstreet. It also gives you their biography,and some of their secerts.So if you haven't read it you better get it=)"
4,G-R-E-A-T,"this book is great.You know My auntie just sent me this book and just handled it.You know i can't buy books about backstreetboys,(but maybe i do,but it's hard for me to find one because i'm from the philippines) but luckily i've had a nice auntie in the U.S. who've sent me this book.But you know i'm really worried 'coz my auntie sent it through mail,so i'm afraid it won't come because some BAD people(philippines) just get it if they found it beutiful for them,so i kept on praying and hoping that the book will be sent to me,and luckily i did. I really recommend this G-R-E-A-T B-O-O-K"
4,Caitlin BSB LOVER,This Book is a Good Book But is very expensive It is Some Where Out of Date.But The Fact That They Where InterViewed For This Book Makes Me Feel BetterGREAT PICTURES
5,Beautiful artwork... fantastic deck... Llewellyn's best,"A beautiful deck full of bright pen and watercolor images that grab the imagination. It has become my deck of choice. The cards are larger than most decks, which I like, and the packaging is well done. This deck makes its home in my best tarot bag... I like it that much. The art is soothing to the eye, unlike the familure Waite/Smith images. The book that comes with the deck is interesting reading but for the beginner this deck and Joan Bunning's workbook are a very good match (even though Joan uses Wait, the images translate nicely... for the most part). This is Llewellyn's best deck in my opinion and you cannot help but come away from this deck anything but a fan of Nigel Jackson's talents. Highly recommended."
3,"A beautiful deck, but...","This is definitely one of the most visually attractive tarot decks I've seen, with luminous pastel coloration and excellent drawing. The images belong to the modern fairytale school, a sort of update to the generic medieval flavor of Waite and the neo-Waite decks.That's the good; now, the bad. The author (who supplies 140+ page book) makes amazing and unsubstantiated claims for the origins of the tarot, the history of his images, and for his training in various secret schools. This last, he says, has provided a number of esoteric, hitherto-unrevealed teachings which he will show in his deck. Unfortunately, most of the deck cards mirror either Waite's tarot or the various Marseilles decks in their symbolism and arrangement of objects, while the few cards that venture out on their own merely provide a new image to one of Waite's previously established definitions. In short, a lot of wind, but precious little new thought blowing by."
2,rin tin tin double feature,These movies were not what I was expectingI was looking for the TV show episides I warched as a kidwith Corporal Rusty and Lutinant Rip MastersSo this to me was NOT Rin Tin Tin
3,Rin Tin Tin Double Feature,"Looked for and found vintage Rin Tin Tin, in two of the orignial movies, ""Fangs Of The Wild"" 1939 and ""Return Of Rin Tin Tin"" 1947. The former being a typical B&W thirties crime drama without much real drama.The later movie was shot in color, however is was so blury and washed out it didn't detract from the vintage Robert Blake acting which was almost as bad as the focus. ""RINTY"" was the best actor in this film."
4,Of God and Dog,"A great ""family"" movieor for anyone who wishes forexciting entertainment withinteresting characters,including a very cool dog,with a happy ending.Particularly of interest forCatholic parents because thesetting is a Catholic missionwhere an emotionally scarredboy is sent for spiritual directionfrom a good priest and gets itwith a big assist from divineprovidence in the form of a dog."
2,Rin Tin Tin,This was not what I expected. I wanted the series that was on TV in the 50's. My bad for not paying attention but I will still watch it.
1,"Good idea, terrible result","This book must have been rushed to press with very little, if any, testing. The author clearly recycled existing conventional recipes, substituting some soy flour in place of wheat flour. To truly succeed in baking with soy ingredients, you need to compensate for the taste and behavior of the soy flour. In my experience making these recipes, they all need adjusting and doctoring. She routinely leaves salt and vanilla out of the recipes, or calls for much too little salt. They generally lack flavor.Additionally, the table of contents and index are next to useless. Every recipe is named ""Soy something-or-other"" which makes it tedious to find what you're looking for. I was thrilled to find this book initially, but am now beyond disappointed with it. If I feel like baking something new, I might look at this book, but I never bake from it. I find better recipes for free on the web."
1,Soy Desserts,"This book has some fairly good basic info in the beginning, but the recipes are unusual. They don't sound appetizing. I didn't see any recipes I liked. I wanted basic recipes like vanilla soy ice cream, strawberry soy shakes, etc..., but they only have recipes with all kinds of unusual ingredients. I wanted healthy recipes also, such as fruit sweetened, etc...."
2,Usability?,"I think the only redeeming grace of this work is that it will perpetuate the dirth of me-too boring sites put up by large companies who seek only to follow what other large companies are doing, and who tend to buy into the myth of meaningless stature afforded to plastic pundits who tend to use politics over talent to sell their ""status"". In that regard, it will afford genuine opportunities for young and/or creative new web designers to have their work stand out.Nielsen set up the industry for this book with definite genius by making his own web site completely plain and, therefore, ""safe"" from measurement against anyone's standards, save for beauty, and perhaps readability. The failure of the great .dotcoms could very well have something to do with the fact that, in their quest to be ""usable"", thay have instead become uninspiring. After reading this book, I feel compelled to make a thousand web sites, each with navigation on the right side of the page.Evan Andrews"
3,These people have no sense of design,"All they did was totally rip every site to shreds. Sure they had good comments on these sites. But their comments overall never took a sense of design into consideration. They bashed every tagline; requesting one that ""describes the purpose of the site"" is a better tagline. Hello??? Ever heard of marketing/advertising? Tag lines don't work this way. They are catchy and functional.While this book gave me a good overalls sense of what a good homepage looks like, I was highly irritated and annoyed by these two authors' comments. If you listen to them, your site will be so boring and bland. Everything creative to them was useless."
3,Rules for Brain Dead People?,"- Recommended for inspiration- Don't simply copy. Use them as strategic guidesBut not every rule applies to every homepage. JN is putting up rules which shall apply for all websites. But they don't. They can not be applied the same way in America, Europe and Asia. It's a mistake to take this book as a bible. People who can not think independently need external rules. Thats what this book provides. Its inspirational and pin points areas you might not have thought about. For that its worth the money. But it can not do the job for you.As uability engineers we have to reflect local requirements. A book on actually how to develop unique rules in any local situation would have been of much greater value."
1,"If you have too much money, get rid of some by buying this.","I'm stunned that any reader would give this book 5 stars.It is filled with obvious and uninsightful nitpicks of popular entry pages (not websites, which is where actual usability comes into play).His capricious evaluation tactics include measuring the percentage of pixels allocated to things like ""white space"", ""self promotional"" and ""filler"" (he does not inform the reader his distinction between such categories. Nor does he indicate what magical percentage he finds appropriate).Anyone looking for usability insight from Nielsen need only look at his mundane website (useit.com) to see the lackluster consequences of following Nielsen's advice (it's also worth a look since much of the 'information' in this book can be had there for free)."
2,"Tedious, very tedious","Don't even bother with this book unless you've also read Jakob Nielsen's ""Designing Web Usability : The Practice of Simplicity"" -- his vastly superior work. It's not that the content of ""Homepage Usability"" is wrong. It's actually insightful analysis... repeated 50 times. The redundancy is the problem. I like Nielsen's work, and it's important to me because I manage a popular website. But this book feels like it was something written as a regular column for a monthly magazine. The redundancy is has a nice preaching-to-the-choir effect if it's a once-a-month reminder; it's mind-numbing if you try to ready 50 of them in a row."
3,"Time to learn about book readability, Jakob...","I have just browsed the book, and got tired after five minutes. Page after page is filled with details about the 50 web designs, but when not prioritized, it's quite hard to follow. I really learned a lot from ""Designing web usability"" because it gave me a theoretical base on how to think about usability design, but this is just like a very long check list.I belive the book is quite useful if you have the time and energy to browse it, but it could have been made more easy to read. Like when pointing out design mistakes (50 websites x 25 mistakes = 1250), why not give some kind of priority? For example green-yellow-red or 1-5?I will probably read all of it, but not today.."
3,"Calm down now, just take a deep breath","Nielsen is an important figure in web design, true, but that doesn't mean that everyt utterance deserves 5 stars. This is a reasonably interesting read, but hardly seems worth the praise here.Yes, this is an application of Nielsen's ideas, which is great. You get to see how his design guidlines can apply to lots of sites, without really resulting in the kind of bland, lowest-common-denominator website that many designers fear Nielsen demands.But, the approach here is just a fire hose of heuristics sprayed all over the place. Does an ""uncompromising autopsy"" (Amazon's words) really sound like an instructive, constructive read? It's really impossible to get a sense of priority here: is this a show-stopper usability problem or is it a minor thing? I'd rather see the kind of thing usability professionals actually write: an attack plan for fixing real problems, with an eye to what matters and what's a nice-to-have."
1,Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! It's outdated. The 50 websites have ALL been completely redesigned, if they even exist today. Nothing in this book was helpful.Homepage Usability: 50 Websites DeconstructedHomepage Usability"
4,Excellent in 2001 - Still applies but now looking dated...,"I bought this book when it first came out. This was an amazing critique of many major websites and I learned a lot from it. I no longer refer to the book as websites have evolved so much from those days. Yes, you can still learn from it but for me now the book is a nostalgia trip into 2001 websites. I think the first generation of great websites. If you can buy this book cheap it is worth getting. Very high quality book but don't pay full price."
2,Jakob is not all he's cracked up to be,"HAve you seen this guy's site, useit.com? That says it all concerning his abilities. He loves to see his name and pictures in print, and that is very obvious from checking out his site.I would not buy his books, nor listen to any of his advise. At best he can offer tips for designing handicapped accesible sites, but that's about it."
4,a ticket to the world wide web,"This book really helped me when it was time for me to design my own website. Reading the book Guerrilla PR Wired convinced me of the necessity of having a website and how much it could benefit me, and Homepage Usability showed me how to make that possible."
4,The definitive guide to home page design,"The value of this book comes from the sheer volume of insight it contains: Jakob and Marie leave no stone unturned listing all the things that make for well-designed home pages.A few downsides:- The home page reviews are comprehensive, but the ""problems"" the authors find get somewhat repetitive after a while. In fact, after reading through about 20 reviews I was able to find more than half of the ""problems"" before reading the review (simply by looking at the screnshots).- Another thing the authors could have done to make the reviews more useful: separate serious problems from trivial ones instead of listing them all in a single list.Conclusion:While the book does have its quirks, it is a solid reference overall and will make a great addition to any web designer's library."
2,Take a closer look before buying,"At first glance, this book seemed like just what I needed. It was deeply disappointing to find that much of the commentary was very arbitrary- superficial and simply opinion without any solid basis. The cases were quite repetitive. It was not nearly as helpful as many free sources of information that are available. This episode reminds me of some of my experiences in building large-scale Web sites and the problems introduced by involving so-called experts."
2,Nielson disappoints again,"Admittedly, I've been biased against Nielson's works since the publication of `Designing Web Usability' in 1999; finding his tendency to oversimplify and `deconstruct' rather ineffectual. And as usual, `Homepage Usability' disappoints as an overly sensational and inaccurate evaluation of homepage usability. There are good parts, in particular, the statistics you may want to reference for your own usability initiatives. But the `50 webpages deconstructed' portion is not much more than Nielson spewing hot air. If you learn (or are entertained) best through critique by an impossible standard and ideal, by all means, this book is for you. If you are looking for a USABLE and real life guide to homepage design, look elsewhere."
3,Seriously????,"I picked this book up and laughed my way through it. Some of the advice is valid and you can certainly learn a couple of things to avoid, but really I thought some of the points exceeded even the (...) realm of ridiculousness. There is just no possible way to make your site perfect for every glob of living organism on the planet. Granted some sites that were reviewed I confirmed my dislike of them after Mr. JN pointed out the things I probably never would have cared to actually think about. Anyhow for a guy who (...) usability his own book has some errors, and layout problems, whats up with that? Good for some, bad for others hence the 3 stars, but my actual rating is 2.5 stars."
5,great seat - no pain,"This seat works well on this bike. No pain, and a great improvement over the hard seat that comes with the bike. Worth the money, for sure!"
4,Wide Bicycle seat,This seat is very comfortable and easily fit over my excersise bike seat (that was hard and very uncomfortable). Now I can excersise for a longer period of time.
5,Fits the Stamina 1300 Exercise Bike perfectly.,This is the perfect seat for the Stamina 1300 Magnetic resistance exercise bike. I ordered it with the hope that it might solve the issue I was having with the original seat being so hard. Problem solved! This seat has been on the bike for nearly a year and it has never had to be readjusted. I just love it. Very comfy and obviously will last a very long time.
3,Did not help enough.,"I bought this to put on my Schwinn Airdyne AD4 seat.It fits the seat well and did improve the comfort but not enough.I ended up buying the ""Large Wide Size Sofa Gel Comfort Style Bike Seat""Sold by: BIKE DEPOT INC. This did the trick and allows me to ride my exercise bike as long as I can hold out."
5,lots of extra padding,"I am very happy with this, also has a gripping material to keep seat cover from sliding."
5,necessary addition,I purchased this seat cover for my Schwinn Airdyne 2 exercise bike. The cover made it possible for me to ride the bike for longer than 10 minutes due to the much improved comfort. I recommend this product to anyone looking for added comfort when using an exercise bike. Shipping was very fast.
4,Seat cover is soft,"I use an indoor cycle and the seat is extremely uncomfortable. Since the seat can not be removed, I need to try a cushioned seat cover or cycle pants. My first option was go with a cushioned seat cover. This seat cover is very comfortable and does keep my bottom from getting sore. The issue for me is that I use spandex shorts and when used in conjunction with this seat cover causes me to slide forward on the seat (feel like sliding off). I end up having a bad riding position. Due to this issue, I went with option 2, and now use cycle shorts for comfort instead."
5,feels great!,"This was for an older person who rides the old Schwinn ""Air Dyne"" BikeThe reason I bought it was to fit over the rather large seat-which it does!yea!And it is cushiony enough to feel ""good"" !Arrived on time, and was easy to put on!Everyone is happy!"
4,"VERY thick and soft, quality covering","This unit is VERY thick and squishy, lust the ticket for a sore buns. The unit is VERY VERY big, so unless you have a jumbo saddle don't get this. It fits on my older bikes jumbo saddle but is just too big on my new bikes medium size saddle. The cover is good quality and snugs up around the saddle with a draw string held by a plastic spring loaded clip."
4,Prepare for the Theatre Praxis,"While this book was not quite up to date with the actual Theatre Praxis, it did help me to prepare for the test--and I passed on the first try! Worth the time to use it to prepare."
4,Over the top,"This film goes a bit slowly, but it has some of the most outrageous visuals you will ever see in a film. If your taste veers towards the wacky or absurd, this film is for you. The scene with the nightclub singer is too funny to describe. Imagine John Waters meets Romania."
5,original et réalisme fantastique,"Volià le nouveau Fellini,De l'autre cté de l'Adriatique est né un nouveau Fellini. Avec Black cat white cat, Bajram Severdzan a réalisé le film le plus origial et le mieux construit qu'il m'a été donné de voir depuis des lustres. Ce réalisateur arrive à brosser un tableau exacte de tous nos travers en peignant la famille telle qu'elle nous empche de vivre la vie rvée que nous aurions vécu sans le poids de la morale qu'elle nous a inculquée tout en la subissant. Faisant de la vie un cul desac dont seul les originaux peuvent trouver l'issue, mais non sans marquer leur passage. Bravo et merci à Bajram Severdzan pour ce merveilleux film.Serge Lemay"
1,I don't get it. This movie is NOT funny at all.,I am thinking that those who gave this 5 stars either have not ever seen a really funny movie or are from this country and find silly homespun slapstick funny.For example. A guy is putting plants on a water deck and a silly girl shoots two of the plants. The guy gets mad and throws the rest of the plants in the water then a table then a chair and then jumps up and down. Funny? No. Stupid? Yes. More of this type of humor throughout the movie. I turned it off after 45 minutes of nonstop unfunny nonsense. You want good movies? See my other reviews and then get back to me.
1,emir is naked,"In plain English the producer has nothing to say but manage to drag forever. The movie is pretty close to reality but I dont watch movies to see how close to reality they are. This movie reminded me "" Showgirls "" where a lot of half-naked chicks run around for no reason at all."
5,One of the best I've ever seen,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Usually I prefer US and English movies. Most europeans movies are kind of boring. But this is one of the exceptions. I had no expectations when entering the cinema, and get out with a big smile in my face. Just wait for the price to come down (106$ is too much). Trust me! I'm waiting for the DVD release."
2,"Sorta funny, but mostly lame","A very accurate testament to the 18 year old boy's mind, this movie's best feature is a shot of Johnny Depp's naked rear-end. It's one of those classically bad 80's movies that's filled with funny cliches (you will roll your eyes), corny characters, and an unpredictable and surprisingly complete plot makes you finish watching."
2,Another one of those silly 80's movies.,The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete!
2,Johnny in his early career,"This was a funny movie just because it was made so long ago and fashions and hairstyles were so retro. Johnny's character thought he was a stud but actually looked so young. Typical story, boys after girls, do anything to get laid, Alcohol and antics made for some laughs. Most memorable moment - Johnny stripping down to his underwear (not quite how I had imagined him looking). A movie to own if you are a Johnny fan and want to collect some of his earlier movies."
5,Room Service,"for anyone who is a fan of johnny depp before he became the name everyone knows him as get this dvd, my friend got this from me as a christmas gift and she was really really happy"
2,A FEW LAUGHS HERE AND THERE,"PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres. However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume.The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers. Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either. Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard. There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't. You can do better, folks."
3,Private Resort,"This is one of Johnny Depp's first films and therefor does not fall into the same class of his future movies. However, it does show his comedic ability and being able to do the best he can with a script that is not the best. I have added this dvd to my Johnny Depp collection simply to have a complete record of his films."
4,A Good and Short Overview of the War.,This book gives a solid overview of the entire Civil War but doesn't read like a just the facts book.The book focus on the key events in both theaters of the war and has chapters on the homefronts as well as the poltical aspects of the war.
4,Good introduction to ACW,"American Iliad provides a well balanced introduction to the American Civil War despite its succinct length. It does glaze over the most important events, but still to limited to much more than a general introduction. For more in-depth research McPherson, Foote, Buell and Catton are the premiere scholars of the era."
2,Fun? Not.,"This was my first--and last--Agatha novel. While the mystery was mildly interesting, the seaside hotel residents portrayed by the author were weak, petty, vicious, and generally unpleasant. I'm sorry I spent more than an hour in their company. What a bunch of whiners! The depressing finish of the love affair between Agatha and the local cop was sad and ugly. Where was the supposedly strong and clever heroine?"
4,Another Charming Little Mystery!,"This installment in the Agatha Raisin series is quite enjoyable. Agatha has decided to holiday (off-season) in a seaside town while her hair grows out. She ends up meeting some truly eccentric octogenarians, and of course murder occurs. This time it is the village ""witch"", and it turns out that she had quite a few enemies. In her blundering way, Agatha sets out to solve the murder and becomes involved with the village police inspector. He's a treat, but true to form, Agatha can't let things take their natural course and precipitates a breakup. Anyway, the mystery is solved, and Agatha has to go back to her life in Carsley (with a new cat in tow)."
3,light duty,"I like the hamish mcbeth series better. Plot was not bad, characters OK. It was OK. enough to read through, not especially great."
3,It's all right,"This book in the series is just ok. Boring would sum it up perfectly. You will get through it if you want to go on to the next book, which is even worse than this one. After awhile, I tire of reading about a person that complains as much as this reader has her character complain. Also tired of the ""bear-like"" eyes reference. Just bizarre. If this next book proves to be as boring, I will quit the series all together."
4,More enjoyable than the last installment,I enjoyed this book much more than the Wizard of Evesham. I agree with the previous comments that it is time for the James Lacey nonsense to be finished. I would love to see Ms. Beaton move Agatha forward and give her a little detective agency or ANYTHING to keep her from being a moonstruck middle aged eccentric that she is turning into.
2,Agatha Raisin ann the Witch of Wyckhadden,I have read all of the Agatha Raisin books and I bought this one with the expectation of enjoyment. I found that the humor in this book has been degraded into the school of --how many ways can Agatha be demeaned and hurt. Before I buy another book in this series I will make sure that I look briefly to make sure that is comes back up tp the level of the previos books.
3,Enough already!,How much longer is Agatha Raisin going to be in love with James Lacey? The mystery aspect of this series has become secondary to Agatha's repeated lapses in good judgement and her continual humiliation. I've never seen a mystery heroine with such bad luck in love. I'd rather see her alone with some dignity than mooning over some man!
5,"Great monitor, great price.","Awesome monitor. No dead pixels - bright, color neutral, and fast. I was VERY impressed with this monitor. The buttons a little stiff and unresponsive - that's my only criticism. Other than that - this monitor is indistinguishable from the the name brand ones that are far more expensive (I understand the panels themselves are sourced from the same factories). A hit and a keeper."
2,Did I get a lemon Seiko?,"I purchased this watch as a present for my wife in October, 2010, because of the size and appearance of the watch and the Seiko reputation. She loves the watch, except that since she has had it, it has on four or five occasions turned up 3 or 4 minutes slow, but still running. Yesterday she found it 15 minutes slow, although the watch was still running. After resetting the watch, it runs normally until the next occurrence, so now it goes back to Seiko for warranty work. I cannot recommend this watch based on the problems my wife has had with it."
3,Later Edition Isn't Always Better!,"I gave my first edition copy to a friend so I ordered this third edition. I was disappointed because the format had been changed...no detailed history in the front and no picture of the nun in the ""Sister Says"" fact boxes. I should have waited and given away the new copy..... :("
1,Not accurately Catholic,This book is full of lies about the Catholic Church. I actually threw it away! It does not even have the inscription of a bishop's approval of its content like all good Catholic books do (and I know why). Please don't read this if you want the truth. You are much better off readingCatholicism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality)).
3,Good information but incomplete and bias,"I was expecting something more objective in this book. It frequently referred to talking to a priest, other catholics and so on, and appeared to assume that the objective wasn't to learn more about the religion, but to become a parishioner. I also noted that it took little opportunity to address some of the more divisive issues within the church and how they might be changed, ie. scandals within the church, divisions from Protestant religions. It did have a great deal of information on the Catholic religion and helped me dispell many of the incorrect information that is out there about the religion."
1,Not to strengthen faith,"TIG does teach about the Catholic Church, but adds too much liberal and mildly anti-Catholic commentary for it to be a strict guide. The jokes are unfunny and it's overall effect is to make the reader not think it very important to be Catholic. In other words, it's not a book you'd give somebody to strengthen their faith or to educate a potential convert. It wouldn't even be one to give somebody wanting to objectively know official Catholic teaching.Asymmetric blog."
1,Completely lacking.,"I bought this book years ago and finally got around to reading it about six months ago. Even with as little as I knew about the Catholic faith, I knew something was off. Finally I saw so many contradictions between what I was learning from it and what I was learning from real Catholic sources that I tired of it and the simplistic way it talked down to the reader and put it down. It now holds up a wobbly end of a table, that's how little I think of it. I'm just glad to find some practical use of it.Do yourself a Big favor and get Catholicism for Dummies by Father John Trigilio and Father Kenneth Brighenti instead of this, it was extremely well written and very, very useful, I'm way ahead of the game in my RCIA classes now."
1,Do NOT read this book if you're interested in learning more about Catholicism,"This book completely misrepresents the Catholic faith. I bought it while in RCIA, and so many things that I read therein were completely at odds with what I'd learned in my classes and from other resources (for example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church). The authors of this book strive to remake Catholicism in their own image rather that accurately presenting the faith as it is taught by the Magesterium of the Catholic Church.Instead of this book, get ""Catholicism for Dummies"" by Fr. John Trijilio. It's 100% faithful to the teachings of the Church, unlike this piece of garbage."
1,"Should be called ""How Not to Understand Catholicism""","I borrowed this book from the local library when I was investigating Catholicism before I eventually returned to the faith. I found the book to be almost as bad as some anti-Catholic books. It tells you little about Catholicism, rather it hints at what the rosary is and how some sick elderly man entering an ambulance is finally able to curse at his son to get his rosary beads. It is also very anti-Christian with using BCE and CE instead of BC and AD to be politically correct. The book actually makes Catholicism appear creepy and pagan, full of ethnic obsessed Catholics.Anyone interested in learning about Catholicism, don't bother with this book."
2,Catholic teaching,"The author and publishers of this book need to seek approval from the church heirarchy to have this book listed as an actual teaching document of the church. It would be more effective and more useful if it had the ""Imprimatur"" of a Catholic Theologian"
2,backpack,"Cute, daughter loved it, but it is too small for a school age child. Perfect for preschool. We had to send it back for the larger one."
3,toddler size,"Please note that this backpack is suitable for toddlers only. While it looks pretty, a child in elementary school couldn't possibly fit their belongings in this backpack."
3,Pushing the envelope,"Eric Meyer is pushing the envelope again. This book is interesting for those who wish to look ahead, and standards continue to develop because people like Eric Meyer do these kinds of things. However, if you are looking for a practical guide to making your own site, this is not the book for you.Quite a few of the tricks and techniques expounded here do not work on the majority of browsers, and very little account of backward compatibility is evident. That is not a criticism of the book, which does what it set out to do in quite an extraordinary and admirable way. Be aware, though, that this book is not for the budding web author wanting to learn something about making pages that work today for the majority of visitors. Better is Eric Meyer's first book in this series, and better still is Eric Meyer's ""Cascading Styling Sheets: The Definitive Guide"" from O'Reilly."
4,Foreward by Bill Belichick,"As written in the foreward by Patriots coach Bill Belichick, written in 2004: ""... because a coach uses physics too."""
5,A must read for anyone,The author of this book will take your life and your heart to new places. If you are dealing with stress to the breaking point or life is taking it's toll READ THIS BOOK. Kathleen Hall is the expert in helping you turn your life around to true joy and helping you learn how to be free from chronic stress.
1,Good Movie - VERY BAD product,i received this movie as a gift and was excited about seeing it. i was terribly disappointed in the quality of video. this is nothing but a horribly made copy. how can Amazon sell these anyway. BUYER BEWARE!!!
3,THE AMBASSADOR'S DAUGHTER,THE MOVIE IS A GOOD COMEDY. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DVD WAS NOT SHOWING A VERY CLEAR PICTURE. SINCE I AM A COLLECTOR OF MOVIES DATING 80% 1930-1950 I WOULD HAVE LIKED A GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURE.
1,"Love the movie, disappointed with the quality of the dvd","I saw this movie on TV and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD recording that they used. You would get better quality if you just recorded the movie off the TV. It is such a shame!!!"
3,Poor Quality VHS Tape,"I had purchased a DVD of Ambasador's Daughter some months ago on DVD. I throughly enjoyed the romantic comedy... both the acting and fashions.... BUT the movie which was filmed in wide-screen was squeezed into a tv frame. The cars were foreshortened, and scenery somewhat wierd. I searched and found the VHS tape with Amazon hopefully to replace the DVD. Unfortunately the tape was no better than the DVD. It would have been better is someone whould have taken the time and made the effort to develop a print closer to the original."
1,Poor content that is not worth the money,"This e-doc has 32 pages of which 12 are acknowledgements, ads for other docs and so on. The remaining 20 pages seem to be displayed randomly by Acrobat Reader, as the case of some ""internal errors"" may be... But you can get such (poor) content from elsewhere on the internet for free. Moreover, it is just a scanned book, so you will not be able to copy text into MS Word. Do not buy the same lemon I got, for refunds on digital items are not easy to get."

4,Very Enjoyable,"I didn't know Charles Rosen from a hole in the ground before I picked this up; I'm just a piano enthusiast. His personality comes through in his writing as he reflects on past concerts and recordings and travels and the likes. Not a memoir, but I suppose something pretty close to it. He essentially goes on about the different facets of being a pianist and if you eat breathe and sleep piano, you're sure to enjoy this. His writing style is polished and rather dignified, without being pedantic or scholarly. Heck I wanna go out and buy all this guy's books and records now. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it took me some getting used to at the first chapter, but once I adjusted to the fact that he's world class material and I'm just a schmuck doing scales, it was all smooth sailing from there."
1,pedantic,"I didn't like the style of the author, it is too pedantic, snob, and he doesn't give enough good insights."
3,Not what I expected!,This is not at all what I expected. It didn't look like the picture... there was some old bottle and the contents had a tacky feel I did not like it at all. Plus it took a long time to arrive. Will not order again.
4,Mid-70s Classic,"I don't know how ""Is He Coming At All"" got left off Wendy's greatest hits album (Love is the Only Goal). This song was a mainstay on the early ""soft-rock"" stations of the mid-70s.The quality of the CD is good. There's a little hiss on my copy, only noticeable in the quieter sections while wearing headphones -- still much cleaner than my old LP ever was.This CD is long overdue."
3,"It's a nice, handy book, with great insights.","There are two characteristics that should be pointed out about this book:1 - It's a black and white book2 - It has the dimensions of a comic book, which are quite smaller than a normal art bookIf you're looking for great colour art check out Mythos: Fantasy Art Realms of Frank Brunner.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 112Number of images: 103Small images: 28Half page images: 17Full page images: 492-page spreads: 9BW images: 103TEXT:Introduction: 1 pageBio: 1 pageThe book has 6 main chapters which cover the artist's career in some detail, and it's written by Brunner himself.ART:3 images: 5 stars32 images: 4 stars62 images: 3 stars6 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 Stars"
4,an eccentric look at the destruction,"An eccentrically lyrical novel of the Holocaust, Oz treats the destruction of Europe's Jews in a mythical vein. The main character is drawn as a cross current between science and religion; cast as a Christ-like figure, his ability to defy the laws of nature is balanced by his rationalism. In keeping with the title, the novel has a strange kind of levitation on the level of language; a kind of realism, it skims the surface of the reality it paints, giving the reader no deep insight into the psychology of the characters. This is not a flaw in Oz's writing. Rather, it is a lesson in metaphysics and mysticism. Touch the Water Touch the Wind is a mediation of what language can and can't explain in human experience."
3,"I just saw her in a private concert in Queens, NY","I just saw her with my girlfriend in a private concert in Queens, NY and she was promoting this CD. Although, she has some nice lyrics and good songs, many of them sounded the same. She is a beautiful person both inside and out but her unique existance was lacking in some of her songs."
2,Terrible Coverage!,"Not at all what I expected. I wish I could get my 30 dollars back. Absolute rip off. They are cashing out with the isde name. They camera guy just stands at the beginning of the race and covers a small flatground section where the riders have to navigate a course taped out for them. No obstacles, just flat turns. Terrible footage. You don't get to see any of the race, just the starting section. Oh yea they cranked up the playback so everything looks like it is in fast-forward. There are some interviews. Explanation of race rules are ok. I feel cheated. I expected to see some race coverage. I have to give them two starts because of what they did record, they did a good job with. But I am still infuriated I payed 30 dollars to watch the same 50 foot section of the race the entire time."
4,Nice collection,"My favorite song on this EP is ""Smoke without Fire,"" mainly because I'm a huge M. Ward fan. But all the songs are pretty damn good. Looking forward to the album release. And from what I hear, only ""Four Winds"" from this EP will be on it. So this is a must-have for Conor Oberst fans."
4,good for SF and non-SF fans alike,"My husband LOVES science fiction. Me, not so much. But I really enjoyed ""The Warrior's Apprentice."" Miles Vor Kosigan is so clever, and it's joy to see him fly by the seat of his pants as he stumbles into a career as a mercenary.If you don't like sci-fi, don't let that put you off. It's a great book for those interested in the suspense of whether Miles can pull off the equivalent of a great heist. (Think ""Ocean's Eleven"" rather than ""Star Trek."") For sci-fi fans, it's the launch of great space opera."
5,Miles to go,"This was the second Vorkorsigan book I read, I'll have to admit. I started with Shards of Honor, so maybe the final fate of a certain person (no spoilers) had more of an impact than otherwise. That said, I really have no clue what the bad reviews had to do with this book. Miles is eighteen and not even His force of personality is enough to overcome his crippled body and get him into the military. When his failure heralds the death of his difficult, but beloved grandfather Piotr, Miles leaves for Beta. How does a eighteen-year-old become the admiral of a mercenary fleet? Not without some slapstick and some heart-rending along the way."
3,"Entertaining, but not great literature","A pleasant read for waiting in Doctor's offices or on the bus. The situations are interesting, and the author's depiction of the point of view of those marginalized by their society (disabled, women, transgendered) is admirable.The plot is fairly predictable, and individuals tend to be caricatures. However, this is very nice light reading."
3,Disappointed,"Apparently, quite a few people like the Vor series, so I picked this one up. I wasn't impressed. Yes, LMB's writing is good, but that doesn't automatically make a good science fiction. The plot simply isn't particularly exciting, the ideas are consistently stale. Worst of all, the story is driven by lucky coincidences and the fact that everybody believes/obeys the main character, mostly without question. Maybe he really is that charming ... but I for one wasn't charmed. YMMV, of course."
4,Very well written space opera,"This was the first of Lois M. Bujold's ""Miles Vorkosigan"" books. This series has won two Hugos for Bujold, and with good reason. They are very solid, well-written adventure stories with excellent characters and fascinating plots. This book is a bit pulpier than the others -- Bujold was still finding her voice -- but still quite good, and the proper place to start if you want to read Miles' adventures in chronological order"
4,Miles Vorkosigan begins his legendary career.,"This science fiction novel deals with the start of the military and mercenary career of Miles Vorkosigan, son of Cordelia and Aral Vorkosigan of the planet Barrayar. The assassination attempt made at the end of the novel ""Barrayar"" (1991) has given Miles a stunted growth and very brittle bones. He is now seventeen years old and tries to qualify for Barrayar's military school but fails. Then, during a vacation on another planet, he finds himself involved in an interplanetary war in which he improvises a mercenary force. Later, upon returning to Barrayar, he finds himself the focus of a plot to destroy the political power of his father. The book, as are most of the books in the Vorkosigan series, are very quickly read and most fans of space operas or of science/military fiction really enjoy them."
4,Great space opera,"This is just plain good fun. Our Hero washes out of the military academy for medical reasons beyond his control - nearly a disgrace to his near-royal family.If he can't get into the Space Army, then he'll just make his own. In a series of improbable events, Miles starts by saving a drunken fellow countryman, washed up on an alien shore. After just a few months, he's worked his way up to command of a mercenary space fleet of his own, recruiting his former opponents (for a paycheck), and using the thousands of soldiers in his private army to ending a destructive civil war. It's an enjoyable, feel-good swashbuckler in a modern style.I can't imagine why books in this series haven't been made into movies. I guess it's because Bujold's perfect balance of humor, heroism, and headlong adventure would be too hard to maintain. Too bad, I guess you'll just have to read the book!//wiredweird"
3,romantic it is in deed,this would be concidered a good relaxing and listenimg to cd. It ei old but i think its one of my favorites in old music oprox. 20 years old that is. I can say that you could judge romantic Mexican music with this cd.
1,A poor software package,"If you are able to read MacAddict's review of this, please know that they are right on the money! This program, though it includes thousands of graphics, is not worth buying. It is difficult to use. It's method of use is far from conventional. The workspace is too small. It is difficult to create things. My mother and I are still trying to become accustomed to it after several weeks of trying to make things work properly. We seriously still laugh at how rediculously difficult it is to use."
3,Not Bad....,"A good product. Not great. But very useable. Yes, it could be a bit more intuitive. But over all, I have found this program (actually it's two programs bundled together) to be very usefull, and so loaded with features and fonts/images that, for the price, it is a very good buy. Well worth it."
4,Canon 14x Manual Pro Lens,Bought This lens about 2 weeks ago and I have to say it is worth the $$$ I paid for it. let me just add that unless you are familiar with a manual type lens that you have to adjust yourself (Like Everything Including the iris!) Then this lens will give you a high budget look at a fraction of the cost! Have this on my already versitle XL2 and it just has become a whole lot better Due to this lens.
5,DIVINE,"OMG, this is my new favorite skirt! It looks amazing on me and is beyond comfortable. I got this in Ross (pink-ish) and the color is wonderful, even better than I expected. The fabric is very soft, stretchy and quite shiny in direct light. Simply divine. Great price too!"
4,Good appetizer,"The book is intended to provide a general idea of most instrumental techniques. The approach is however quite profound. Rather than promote another instrumental analysis book with little material application theory, the book is intended to underscore a source-sample interaction/principle and resultant sample-detector principle. Thus the logic is easily translatable. A good book. References enable the reader to read more about different techniques."
3,A Crazy FLIM!,"The Pink Panther is a good movie. It could have been a little though. I thought it would be better because all the time before it was finally released. It's first release date was late 2004!, and now it is 2006. The Pink Panther is a good movie, but is not the best."
1,Why bother?,"They have put copy protection on this DVD apparantly so good, my DVD player, a Toshiba, won't even play it. I purchased this DVD, then I rented it at my local video store to determine if the DVD I purchased was bad.Nope, none of the Pink Panther DVDs will play in my standard Toshiba DVD player.I have over 200 movies I have purchased, but this is the first movie I have ever purchased that won't allow me to watch it. It's like buying myself a treat with a child-proof cap that cannot be opened.I recommend NOT purchasing this movie. Just turn on your DVD player to see the default screen and save the $20. Because that's all I see unless I buy a special DVD player that will play it and, for this movie, why bother?Or give your $20 to someone in exchange for letting them kick you in the shins. At least that will heal and work."
1,Beware of slapstick done badly!,"Slapstick, unless done properly, often fails miserably and this is yet another example of how not to do it.Peter Sellers was quite possibly a master of slapstick and I still look fondly on the original movies. Why anyone would consider it a sound move to remake this film is beyond me.The whole movie was unbearably unfunny from start to finish and I suggest anyone who wishes to get some entertainment value out of it should pause it everytime Steve Martin touches something, see if you can guess what will happen next, then press play again. I expect most people to score 100%."
3,Thinking Pink?!,"There are sometimes where a decent film can be remade fairly well, but that hasn't really been the full case with the past year on rendidtions of Bewitched, The Honeymooners, and Taxi. That also has been said for Steve Martin and his starring role of The Pink Panther. Unlike most of the remakes, his character has pulled it off very well, and continues to showcase a great sense of humor. Sadly, I wish I could say the exact same thing for Beyonce' who has definitely overexposed her image not just as a actress who was quite hammy, but also the fact that her song Check On It is realy overplayed. She unfortunately weighs the enjoyment of the film down. But overall, it is a fairly put movie for anybody who hasn't seen the original. Otherwise, you are better off seeing another great film like Curious George or Final Destination.Story: B-Price: C+Movie: COverall: C+"
1,Pink Panther,"This movie was a poor attempt at reviving Peter Sellers with Steve Martin. It was not to the standards of Sellers, and I don't think Martin is the comedian Sellers was. The story line left you hanging, and was very shallow."
1,An Important Film,"This movie is significant because it proves beyond doubt that Inspector Clouseau and his world are gone forever. Hollywood apparently has neither the actors nor the writers who can hold a candle to the originals. Let us be thankful that the real Clouseau, Dreyfus, Cato, et.al., are forever enshrined in films that will always be available.Peter Sellers was funnier walking into a closet, or trying to kill a bee, than all the actors in this thing are for the whole length of the film. And the original films did not depend on a lot of contrived sex scenes in a vain attempt to seem funny or sophisticated. Nor did the originals think it hilarious to have Clouseau mispronounce ""hamburger"" about twenty times in the same scene.What a mess."
2,Disappointing,"Although this production did generate a few laughs, the casting is poor, and frankly I expected better from Steve Martin. It can be summed up in the five second segment in which he noisily passes gas in what he thinks is a soundproof room--yuk!"
3,Inspector Clousseau Returns,"I must admit I was both delighted and a bit leary about the proposed remake of the classic Peter Sellers vehicle. Talk about big shoes to fill! But the choice of Steve Martin in the role is no far stretch;I think the shoes fit rather well. The basic story remains the same with the search for the missing famed Pink Panther diamond intact. Steve Martin is at times hysterical in the role of Clousseau, followed closely by comic timing of Kevin Kline as Clousseau's superior but many places in the story fall flat. The biggest saving factor is Martin's portrayal of Clousseau which makes up from stony peformances by Beyonce. Although very worth a viewing, you may want to rent it to see if it's worth the purchase for your collection."
3,It's just another physical comedy remake.,"The Pink Panther is not that funny, because the jokes are quite boring and the fun is generated by the snap-stick moments. I think Steve Martin tried really hard to play Inspector Clouseau, with a decent French accent, but it's not as good as Peter Seller's portrayal. Kevin Klein is rather wasted in a role that is too low-key for a snapstick. Beyonce is nothing short of eye and ear candy, and it's a treat to hear her sing and get all dolled up, but she's got too little screentime. The real French actor Jean Reno has a big supporting role as Clouseau's sidekick. Jason Statham and Clive Owen both made a cameo appearance. I enjoyed Steve Martin's Shopgirl way more than this unintelligent snapstick."
1,Hollywood sux!,"Take a classic original film, dumb it down, add washed up or 2nd rate actors and you have Hollywood for the new millenium.Don't pay for crap, download it or better yet, rent the original!"
3,Better Luck Next time,"This Movie Should not have been touched, unless you cast the right people. Steve Martin is a great actor, don't get me wrong, he's a veteran and paid his dues, he should not have played this roll. If you see Rowan Atkinson in ""Johnny English"" or Matt Dillon play the roll in ""There's something about Mary"" or Geofery Rush in ""The Peter Sellers Movie"". One of the three would have been better suitors for this roll."
3,"Pretty good, but watch it first","The movie was great, and it was interesting and funny, but the way the movie was made wasn't exactly the most gripping plot. If you want to see it, rent it, but I wouldn't get it. You should really watch it before you consider buying the movie. To me, it isn't the kind of movie that makes me want to watch it over again. Your opinion may be different, but in my world, this movie is the kind of film that I would watch maybe once or twice every half year. I do think that this is a way better version of the Pink Panther than the Peter Sellers version, but again, it's only my opinion. Really, you should watch it though. It's funny how Steve Martin's role always checks the curtains while talking about the weather."
1,Horrible,"Peter Sellers is rolling over in his grave with disgust over this garbage. Sellers ""act was natural, Martins ""act"" is forced, childish, and humorless. I was not able to finish watching it, easily one of the worst movies ever."
1,Pathetic Panther,"Total waste of money and time for both the producers and consumers of this piece of trash. Unfunny lines delivered by no talent actors. Martin's accent wavers between French, German, Russian and British. No matter, the writing wouldn't generate a laugh no matter how well delivered, and there was no way this cast would deliver. Beyonce displays her lack of talent as well. This movie is a pathetic attempt to make money by attempting to imitate a great original."
2,Pass on this one.,"It's the three stooges-minus two people-minus the comedy. No surprises. Vary predictable. I like Steve Martin and he did alright here, but the script was ho-hum at best. It's too difficult to be better than Peter Sellers and this movie did not pull that off. I would rent or watch it before you purchase."
1,shows he has no talent,"after watching this movie, i now relize steve martin has no talent. he is the most irritating person on this earth.it will be the newest for of torture.save yourself the pain.dont even think about watching this 'movie'"
2,"Lame movie, but I liked it anyway","Overall, the movie is undeniably weak. As a fan of the original, however, I have to admit that I liked it. Even so, I couldn't justify spending $16 to actually buy it."
2,"Well, it wasn't the horror show I expected...","I will admit I expected to hate this movie, and this is in no way saying this is a good movie...but it did make me laugh at a few scenes, a few more than I thought possible, and Steve Martin did redeem the already doomed film with his natural comedic timing. The plot is moot from the beginning since it's as implausible as it is ridiculous, but like I said, it's a moot point since the plot is the last thing you'll remember. Remember the joy you felt hearing Steve Martin utter the words ""I would like to by a Hamburger"" and you'll instantly remember why you can't hate this movie, even if you don't like it. I know two stars may still seem very low, but entertainment doesn't always have to be top-rate...sometimes it just has to kill some time."
2,Nobody's perfect,"Don't get me wrong: I think that Steve Martin is a huge talent as a performer and a writer. That's why I was so surprised that this remake of the classic Peter Sellars comedy franchise, which Martin stars in and co-wrote, is so embarrasingly bad. This misfire is perhaps a career low for Martin, who will no doubt go on to do more great work in the future. I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 because I fell asleep a few times, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I missed some good jokes, but most likely I missed a lot of stinkers."
2,Not for children,"This version of the Pink Panther should have warnings about language and highly sexly suggestive scenes. I don't want to hear the ""b"" word or others while watching movies with my kids. I also don't want to see a woman wrapping her legs around Martin's head, or other scenes that were meant to suggest sexual positions and sex. Come on! Did Martin think ""the kids won't get this one"" while he wrote it in?The original Pink Panther movies were wonderful, and don't need half baked Hollywood remakes. Peter Sellers and David Niven had no equal, and, as much as I like Steve Martin, he doesn't come close to Seller's version."
1,Martin Misses Again,"Anyone who saw Martin's version of ""Sgt. Belko"" should have seen this version of ""The Pink Panther"" coming like a bad car wreck.Martin is always better off with original material rather than a re-imagining of old,well-known classic material made famous by other comedians/actors. Do you think any other comic on the planet could do a remake of ""The Jerk""?On the ""Pink Panther"" movie itself; it was not just a poorly done rehash, but it missed the point of Seller's dry delivery and slapstick mishaps as the clueless Inspector Clouseau.There was just not one memorable, laugh out loud moment I can recount in the whole film. Probably because I was constantly thinking how horribly mis-cast this film was.If ANYONE should have been Couseau, it should have been Kevin Klein. His performances in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and ""French Kiss"" proves his comedic chops.Reno as Martin's assistant was another blunder. Where the hell was Cato? A major missing link in the Clouseau chain."
1,Stupefying,"Stilted, vapid and utterly predictable. And that was just Beyonce. The rest of the movie was even worse. There was exactly one laugh in the whole thing -- the end credits list a dialect coach for Kevin Kline! In one scene he's English, the next he's kinda-sorta French, and in the next he just gives up altogether.You know how in Jerry Lewis movies you can always tell what the gag is going to be about 10 seconds before it happens? Every time? This movie bests that by about 15 seconds."
1,Steve Martin Tried too Hard,"This movie was not funny. Martin is usually great, but for some reason, this role was a mis-match for him."
2,The punked panther,"Movie remakes are always dicey, and it's often the best-loved movies that get remade. As a result, remakes often fall short of the level defined by the original. Steve Martin's remake is a unfortunate demonstration of that phenomenon.The original was clever, sophisticated, and drily witty. Martin plays Clouseau with broad physicality, funny accents, and a bit of potty humor. In other words, the exact opposite of Peter Sellers. It's like a Barney sing-along trying to imitate Placido Domingo. When called by this panther, don't anther.//wiredweird"
5,OH come on folks,"really, how could you say this? Sure, maybye Steve Martin isn't exatly pink panther, but you gotta admit he's funny. Folks who are reading this review, don't lishten to the people say that Steve Martin isn't funny. If you liked Cheaper by the Dozen 1 and 2, you will love this. And they approved the storyline and now it makes sense. Even if the hater of Closeau isn't as good as the other guy, oh well. Steve Martin has clever jokes such as the glob scene, the english learning scene, the sliding down rail scene, every scene is hilarious except the sad part and the beginning. The cartoons at the beginning have better graphics, and are just as funny as the past. Trust me, the people who said this is bad, they have no sense of humor whatsoever. You need a sense of humor for.....your life. To have fun. Well, I hoped this review helped. Farewell"
4,Clouseau Returns in Good Form,Steve Martin returns in one of the best cinematic roles ever created. Inspector Clouseau and his antics have always been the catalyst for outrageous mayhem and fun. This is true to form from Peter Sellers' approach to the role. That is what makes this film so successful and funny. Steve Martin is the third actor to portray Clouseau (the fourth if you include Roger Moore's appearance in CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER in which Moore may or may not have been Clouseau) on screen. Alan Arkin played him in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU in an intentionally dry fashion. Martin returns to Maurice Richlin's character as honed by Sellers and that seems to work very well here. Christophe Beck's score is admirable and he has Henry Mancini's Pink Panther Theme down in a robust elegiac form.
4,"The weather is nice, and I want a damberger","It is a comedy, so of course it has a lot of non-sense. But the point is, it makes me laugh, and that's all I care. This movie is one of the best of Steve Martin. Not for politically sensitive viewers becuase it makes fun of certain nationalities."
4,Blu Ray Review,"I'm not going to talk about the movie at all, this review is mainly for the quality of the blu ray version. I have watched this movie numerous times on standard DVD, the picture of the blue ray has more sharpness than the SDVD, the brighter colors are more vibrant, but the darker colors, and especially the blacks are kind of smudgy in places. Sound is excellent on the blu ray. If you're trying to decide between the two versions for your initial purchase, buy the blu ray. But I would hesitate to upgrade to the blu ray if you already own the SDVD unless you're a big fan of the movie."
4,Too funny,"If you need a laugh, please watch this movie. Steve Martin does a good job as the lead character."
3,"Funnier then you would think. It's a ""Good One""","Most people who see this movie on a store shelf probably just look at it and move on. I agree, it seems like it would be horrible. But there are some good laughs in here, so if you can find it cheap, it is worth it."
2,Accent grave,"The worst, most incomprehensible, accents in recent films. English, French and American in a single sentence. A couple of laughs, but no threat to Seller's work."
2,What I learned from this movie...,"1) Kevin Kline needs an agent that can get him better movies.2) Jean Reno shouldn't take every part he is offered3) As an actress Beyonce adds less to a movie than Madonna4) If Steve Martin sinks any lower he'll be competing for roles against the likes of Steve Guttenberg, Pauly Shore and Judge Reinhold, and since he appears to have shed the last vestiges of his pride expect to see Cheaper by the Dozen 3,4 and 5 at your video store soon."
3,simple,"ok i will keep this review simpleif your a big fan of the original pink panther movies and peter sellers you probably wont like this movie , if you are younger and have never seen any pink panther movies , this is a very funny movie"
3,Pink Panther Alright with me,Steve Martin and Kevin Kline was the best in this movie. Steve Martin was excellent as Inspector Closeau. The humor was great even though this wasn't much of a movie. I would defintely buy it on DVD.
3,Saved by the .... Steve Martin,"After reading the screenplay of this movie there would be no way in He*l that I would believe if I told myself I was going to give this film a 3 out of 5. It is pitiful. Whoever wrote this screenplay should go back to learning they're ABC's. This movie was saved only by Steve Martin's performance as Inspector Clouseau. Steve Martin's Witty accent and dumb behavior is absolutly hilarious, the screenplay works around the humor but the storyline and everything else are so completely clishe it makes me sick to my stomache. Usually I have alot more to say about a movie but this time I am at a loss of words.Final thought: The movie was bad but saved, somewhat by Steve Martins Witty humor. Your smaller kids will like it and you will find yourself laughing on quite a few occastions. You might as well just buy a stand up comedy film because you wont give a rats a*s about what is happening and what will happenGrade: C-Then again what do I know I am only 16 ..."
1,Terrible and Unnecessary,"The original Pink panther movies are a classic and a blue print for comedy making. The team Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers offered us some of the most imaginative and funny moments in the history of motion pictures.This remake is a shame and an insult to the original. More on the lines of Airplane and similar spoof comedies. I find Steve martin usually irritating in film. He is outstandingly irritating on this one. The rest of the cast does not fare any better unfortunately. Even Kevin Kline usually outstanding is wasted here.I hope everyone involved in this travesty does not work on a motion picture ever again.Skip this one, and run to the video club to rent the originals; any of them. Just the opening credits will make you forget this disgrace."
2,"Disappointing, Considering the Cast","I was shocked to see how many 4 and 5 star reviews this movie got. I love good slapstick and silliness, I think Steve Martin is almost always hilarious, Kevin Kline is fantastic and way underrated and Jean Reno is a fine actor. Given all that, I was shocked and disappointed at how bad this movie was. There were a few very funny moments, but the rest of the movie felt tired and predictable, and even the slapstick was poorly done and not nearly as amusing as I'd expected. I thought some of the slapstick and jokes might be funny to children, but it also had enough inappropriate moments that I might be hesitant to allow children under maybe 10 or so to see it. No nudity or swearing, but just enough sexual humor to make it a toss up.I won't be buying this, and I'd probably recommend skipping it unless you have a couple hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else on TV. I didn't watch any of the extras, I was just happy it was over."
1,Terrible!,This was one of the most stupid films Ever!It's also not even funny. and maybe it would be better if it wasn't ever made!Rated PG for innuado suggestive humor and language
1,the pink panther,have no got it yet can not create a review .it has been 4 weeks and it has not got to me yet
3,"Enjoyable and worth seeing, but not as good as the original","This remake of the classic Pink Panther films is funny and silly, as it is supposed to be, and entertaining, as well as finely acted, but it is not as good as the classic. Peter Sellers was somehow more ridiculous and more entertaining than Steve Martin. Additionally, there is really nothing new added to this film that was not in the classic. True the plot is different and the inspector stumbled over new objects, but these changes were simply variations of what were in the classic."
2,Disappointing,"Why does Hollywood keep producing terrible remakes of classic movies? I'm a big fan of Steve Martin'a work- and yet I could not sit through this awful movie. Peter Sellers' Clouseau was a very nuanced character, a man who may have been incompetent, but who went about his business very seriously. He realized when he made a mistake, and much of the humor arose for Clouseau's attempts to recover from his mistakes. Martin's Clouseau, by way of contrast, is simply a clown, who blunders through thinks completely unaware of the havoc he is creating, or of any of the effects of his actions. I suppose if you've never seen any of the original Peter Sellers films you might find Martin's slapstick enjoyable, but anyone who finds Sellers' Clouseau to be one of the great comic figures of film will find this movie (and its sequel) to be a huge disappointment."
1,Painful,"It is absolutely painful to watch a talent like Steve Martin butcher this role so badly. His accent is absurd, and he just looks ridiculous trying to be a character who he obviously is not. The story and acting are canned and thoroughly uninspired. It looks like a marketing department tested the concept, got a decent response and then created a product based on the testing."
3,they are ok,"We just use these for playing different games at our church youth group, ( not ping pong), and they work fine."
4,Great Value,I was looking for the best deal on ping pong balls. I believe I found it with these and I am very satisfied with my purchase. However I did receive orange balls instead of white balls as described.
3,Good buy if you're lookin for a deal,"As far as mobster movies go, The Godfather is well....the godfather of them all, even though it was made 30 years after the heyday of Jimmy Cagney and Eddie Robinson. You won't find any of Cagney or Robinson's films in this set, but you will find 16 decent mobster/crime movies, which is a great value at this price.This set by no means has any great or even really good movies in it, but all of the movies are watchable, and for this dirt cheap price, you can't really argue with that.Every thrift store i've been in has at least 1 of these sets, so i guess they're not for everybody, but they are extremely cheap, so why not shell out a few bucks to give em a try?"
4,"coool, jazzy and easy to do",I love this book. It's great fun and really good to practice reading music too Because it's all so simple. (ie: if you can't read music and want to this book is great.) Of course the TAB is there for us music illiterates. The best part is getting that jazzy groove going which you can start doing from the moment you open the book! Fun is where it's at with this little course. I'd give it five stars if it was thicker and kept advancing.
1,"Sorry folks, but it's absolute junk.","I had the misfortune of purchasing this book/CD set. I coudn't find a single piece that was worth playing - it was a painful repetition of a single technique (bass-chord, bass-chord, etc). Unfortunately, since I had written my name on the cover before checking out the CD, I could not return it and collect a refund. I am willing to mail it free to anyone who wants it.Mario Ratnaraja nuages69@yahoo.com (formerly andrews2@sri.lanka.net)P.S Incidentally, I heartily recommend Duck Baker's ""Art of fingerstyle jazz' CD to anyone. I even played it on 'Jazz with a guest' over Sri Lanka Radio ."
4,Mel Bay fingerstyle Jazz,"I haven't used this book long enough to make a valid review,however so far the book has been helpful. The book starts out withsimple examples of walking bass lines with chords and graduallyincorporates different timing and chords. Easy to follow with the CD."
4,Classic Reform in an old package,"First written in 1923, this edition promotes the ideas and ideals of an American Judaism facing unions, women's rights, world war and a fast changing world. In its time it was used by what is now the largest organized identified Jewish population in existence. It is NOT modern, hip, or relative to the 21st century. but reflects the best efforts of a group of rabbis coming to grips with modernity. It provides an understandable ritual for English speakers who want to lean about Passover."
3,It's not my favorite but,"when I use it while working, no one has complained. Note: no one gushes about it either. It's okay, but I usually want to pull it half-way thru the massage."
5,Coleccion del Recuerdo Vol. 3,"Great CD for bilingual kids! I was raised in a Spanish speaking country and this CD brings lots of good memories, and I'd like my baby to learn these songs!"
3,Mostly satisfied,"I received this book in a timely manner. However, this book was purchased as a new book and when I received it, the book looked used."
1,I want my nine bucks back.,"OK, this is my first experience with Ramtha, other than the DVD ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" ...In this small book you'll learn that thoughts levitate above your head, and eat your past, because they are at a higher vibration. Also, when you levitate, you eat gravity. And when sound waves peak and trough closer together, they are actually lower in frequency, not higher (someone give Ramtha an oscilloscope!).As a bonus, there's a glossary in back of Ramtha-specific terms explained and sporting (SM) marks so it seems JZ is protecting her rights to make up terms. I don't remember the Buddha filing any trademarks, do you?Ugh. Rambling nonsense."
4,Most of the older songs,"This CD brought back many memories as I listened to songs that Andre Crouch wrote and have been sung by so many. It was so inspiring and enriching to hear once again. I would recommend this CD. There were a couple of songs that weren't to my liking and that's why I rated it with a 4. Otherwise, it's great."
3,Student Violin Strings,These are standard student strings. They initially will sound harsh. After breaking in they are tolerable. They are a good value and seem to last a long time.
4,Pulls No Punches,"One of Bukowski's bucket full of virtues is that he tells the truth, and he pulls no punches here in talking about the phenomenon known as ""Hollywood"". I did find some of the person to person interaction to be thin, but that could be that human to human interaction in Hollywood tends to be thin. Bukowski lets it be known that he questioned his motives in going Hollywood and becoming something that he used to look down on only a short time before - for this alone I respect him immensely as not a lot of them who do this care to make a public introspection afterwards. Bukowski was a real man. Read this book"
4,Hollywood Trilogy,"I have just begun reading books of historical Hollywood fiction and I love it. Even though I don't know who they mean, I can clearly see the characters as described. My three favorite books this year have been ""Hollywood"" ""Hollywoodland Kingpin"" ""Carter Beats The Devil."" All are terrific Hollywood romps; semi-fictional, based on real-life behind the scenes events. Thorne Peters and Glen Davis Gold are debut authors. Old Hollywood was way more exciting than today's Hollywood. I'm just learning about speakeasies and flapper girls with brandy flasks in their garter belt. It makes me look at my 87 year old grandmother a little differently, knowing she was a young girl going to those places in N.Y. I wish she had told me these stories when I was growing up....This is a must read book!"
4,Not the Usual Neighborhood,"Bukowski exposes the LA film community as having less intersesting and less upsetting characters than his usual neighborhood of drunks and whores and working stiffs. In this climb from the gutter to the glitter, Buk's acceptance into the open arms of Tinsel Town-fake repulses him. Hollywood is supposed to be the epitome of weirdness, yet Bukowski realizes and satirizes all the stars and wannabes for what they really are--career-oriented, image-conscious public darlings coached by agents and lawyers on what moves to make to ensure power and fame. His other novels dwell in the true seamy underside of life. In Hollywood he finds surface types posing as hard livers and wrings big laughs out of it, but I missed his more authentic cast of down & out characters with true desperation."
4,More drunken humor from Bukowski!,"This is Bukowskis humorous account of the making of the movie Barfly. Its funny to see the subtle name changes of people like Sean Penn, Mickey Rourke, Faye Dunaway, Tom Jones, Madonna (he referred to her as Ramona) and Bukowskis humorous and not always very complimentry recollections and opinions of them.Hollywood isn't as good as Ham on Rye, Post Office or Women but its still very good and worth reading."
3,"not his best, but still pretty good","I f you haven't read bukowski before, don't start with this one, pick up Notes of a dirty old man, or try some of his poetry, Love is a dog from hell is good. This one does provide some insight into what it must've been like for our alky friend to deal with uppity Hollywood types, completely out of his element. And it ws nice to see how the man finally got himself into a nice home and descent settings to drink and write in, and, I won't give it away, but I LOVED how he ended it."
2,Bait and Switch,"I ordered Bukowski's ""Hollywood"" after looking at the book online and seeing that it was published by Black Sparrow Press. Imagine my disappointment when I got the book and it was published by Ecco, NOT Black Sparrow. I might send it back for an exchange. Haven't made up my mind yet. I consider this a ""bait and switch"" con job that Amazon doesn't care much about. I do! I will think twice before ordering anything from this site in the future."
2,Flatland: The Other Movie,"I'll assume that the reader has alreay enjoyedAbbott's classicshort novel. Perhpas you read it as a mathematically oriented youth, or perhaps as a mature reader dipping into a Victorian parody of Victorian gender and class politics. Either way, you'll find a flattened, two-dimensional version of the story you loved.Although much more professionally done thanFlatland the Filmand with some big name voices, this strays far from the original story. Females, for example, are geometric and social equals of the males, and an Area 51-style conspiracy theory appears at the center of the story. Overbearing overlords of the society come across as petty tyrants - too obvious to be at all threatening, at least to any viewer in a multi-digit age group.The mathematical commentary survives, with a pleasant ""extra"" from an Ivy League math professor, but that's about all that's left of Abbott's original points.-- wiredweird"
3,Flatland the Movie,"I saw some of Flatland the Film on YouTube I then ordered Flatland the Movie by mistake. The movie I think is intended for a much younger audience. Hex the main character has a slightly annoying childishness about her voice, which doesn't tally with the maturity and imaginativeness of her thinking.A very nice short movie for the under 12s."
2,disappointing,"This is a disappointing rendition of Abbott's classic novel. It is very professionally produced but lacking in originality, and of limited educational value. A great opportunity missed. The interviews with the actors are (unintentionally) hilarious."
1,FLATLAND: THE MOVIE,"Flatland: The MovieI HAD TO GIVE 1 STAR, THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT LET ME GIVE IT NONE. THE BOOK IS NOT ONLY A GEOMETRY TEXT BUT A SATIRE AND COMMENTARY ON VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND ITS RELEGATION OF WOMEN TO SUBORDINATE LEVELS AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. THE DVD IS NOT ONLY A MEDIOCRE GEOMETY LESSON WITH POOR GRAPHICS AT BEST, BUT IGNORES ABBOTT'S SCHOLARLY TREATISE AND SUBSTITUTES A MODERN AMERICAN PSYCHO BABBLE ABOUT ""FOLLOWING YOUR DREAM"". THE COPYRIGHT MUST HAVE EXPIRED ON THIS WORK. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE OWNING THIS PROPERTY APPROVING THE TRAVESTY THAT THE SCRIPT FOR THIS 25 MINUTE DVD IS."
1,Disappointment,Save your money and get the book. Another case of Political Correctness run amok. I should have know better.
3,Great ball for casual/decent players.,"Great ball while it lasts. I'm in college and there's a lot of people who smash the life out of this ball and it lasted me about three days per ball. Again, I'm in college and people like to show off their smashes, I highly recommend for anyone who play casually or a little competitive. Just watch the smashes."
1,Terrible Balls,"For 3 star balls, these are a waste of money. The dont bounce off the table as you would expect and they dont carry spin well.I do not recommend these to any experienced table tennis player."
3,sent ping pong balls instead of tennis balls,"sent to a relative - they opened the box and got ping pong balls instead of tennis balls - well, until you dig deep into the reviews you don't know they meant table tennis balls. I admit I ordered kind of quickly; I did a search on tennis balls and these came up. They're probably fine ping pong balls but the label needs changing."
2,Not great,I dont feel like its a 3 star ball. I wish it could be much more better. Not kind of satisfying experience.
4,Good value,"Color stands out when one one missing. They are a bit bouncy, probably not league ball standards but OK for home use."
5,Good tennis balls and last long,I bought a dozen (2 packs) half year ago. We play everyday. Now there are still 4 of them are playing. They are good in performance and color. They seems last very long if you don't step on them.
2,suits low level recreation play,"Obviously we can't compare these to, say, a $3.50 3-star nittaku. It is cheap, low and inconsistent in quality, and therefore good for low level club play. I would not recommend these for technical training even at beginner level, or league play for points."
3,Good for first year teacher,"I liked this book, however I was looking for something that I hadn't thought of before. It is great for new teachers, but as a veteran teacher it really didn't offer me anything different."
1,Vettriano,"Do not order the Vettriano stationery. You will not get it. Instead, you will get a Vettriano 2006 Date Book which has the same ISBN number as what Amazon has on the stationery. Nice date book but definitely not what I ordered."
5,A terrific atlas!,I purchased this atlas to teach world geography to jr. high students and it is fantastic. Each student also has one and they have a terrific time using it and discovering new facts. It is also extremely easy to use. I wish I purchased this years ago.
4,This was originally Dear Mr. Blueberry!,"What on earth?!! I have been using Dear Mr. Blueberry for years with my students to teach letter writing and, incidentally, about whales. It has been changed and re-issued as Dear Greenpeace! I think the story is still good, but I can't figure out why they did this. I do think it takes away a little of the human connection of the letters."
2,un-satisfied,"Yes, it's a translation, and that's all. Was expecting the entire Bible, not just the New Testament, especially for that price. The name says it's the 'Holy Bible'."
5,Every Jewish Girl should have this book!,"The JGirl's Guide is an invaluable book for young girls. If you would like your friend, daughter, student, cousin.... to get much more out of their bat-mitzvah, and so much more out of being a Jewish teenager - struggling with identity, as well as common teen issues such as food and peer pressure. What a wonderful idea to finally come out with something fun and interesting in an era where we sometimes need to be reminded that even though life can be a party, we must not forget how meaningful it is- and when we are reminded and taught, then it because that much more fun!"
5,Fabulous,This is a great book. I read it while in school to be a nurse practitioner and during the tough times it was very inspirational for me. I feel like Courtney Davis was in the same clinic as me. I gave it to my mom to read so she could understand better what I'm doing.One of the best books I've ever read! :)
4,Interesting Points in History,"AWESOME, COOL, EXCITINGThis book was a great experience for me. It taught me how life changes . It had information about wars, if you like wars. It's amazing how life changes like when a water-powered turbine powered a belt which produced electricity used to make quilts and cloth.There is a little square on the page that tells you the year and place in the U.S. that the event took place. It has numbers to tell you what is what in the illustrations.I loved the part about Ellis Island! Back then there were big mansions. Now a days there are not as many mansions. Read this book to learn about events in history you have never thought about before."
5,Best album ever,"I love this album, i found it and bought it after listening to Celtic Invasion and Celtic Spirit. his other album is just as good. just a shame that they are too hard to find though."
3,Really only 21 pages of content....,"A full 10 pages of this download are advertisements, title pages from the original full version of the book, and acknowledgements. That leaves 21 pages of content about the book. This information itself is very good, but $5.95 for 21 pages is a lot. You get two pages about the author, a page or two of a summary of the book, five pages of character summaries, a page or two each on style and themes, a few pages of historical context, a page of suggestions for what to read next, and then the remainder is critical essays from various authors."
2,Tarawa and Iwo Jima,"Most of this vidio is in a modified black and white, which has been made to look like old color. Most of the footage is old standard WWII footage, whith the exception of the naval bombardment portion off Iwo Jima which I personnally have never seen before and is quite good. The vidio quality looks like someting borrowed from a friend which is about 3rd generation dubbing, in other words the tape quality is very poor."
2,Not My Cup of Tea -,"I didn't realize this was a 'Bonus Material' disc, with a career review of John Inman, Mollie Sugden, Wendy Richards, and a review of British slang. No actual episodes. Next time I'll be more careful."
1,NOT EPISODES JUST BIOS,"I WAS GROSSLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THIS WAS NOT what I expected. I thought it was more wonderful episodes of the show, but it turned out to be nothing but bios of the actors. I love the actors, but that isn't what I wanted. There was nothing in the write up about it being a bio CD. Very disappointing."
5,My most treasured book from childhood,"I read this book as a third grader in the seventies. I was so profoundly moved by it that I wrote a letter to the author. I got a personally handwritten letter back from her husband telling me she had passed away some years ago. His letter was so kind and appreciative, it only deepened my love for this book (and series) and helped me become an avid reader. I recommend this book to people of any faith. It is about families and growng up and being true to yourself."
5,All-Of-A-Kind Family Book,This book was on my granddaughter's Christmas gift list. She teaches 3rd grade and wanted the book to use in classroom discussions. It is a lovely book and portrays a wonderful message of value to all. The book was very well priced and will be a wonderful addition to her library.
5,A great story of family life early this century.,"I read this book for the first time last summer at age 11. I won it a my library's summer reading program and was rather annoyed because it wasn't the book I wanted. But as soon as I picked it up I loved it, and couldn't put it down. I thought the girls were really adorable and liked hearing about the simple pleasures they got out of life. It made me more aware of the many privilages we have now and how much we take for granted. And now I hear their are secuals! I can't wait to find them."
5,Wonderful Children's Book,"I first read this book as a child and recently picked it up again when I was feeling nostalgic. (I'm 33) This story tells the tale of 5 little girls growing up in New York City on the East Side in the early 1900's. Being poor, the girls find joy and pleasure in little things that today we would take for granted. A few chapters into the book and you realize that they are Jewish. Without being religious, the book explains some of the Jewish holidays and how the little girls participate in the rituals. This is a wonderful book of family and hope that gives the reader a glimpse into a different time, place, and culture."
5,Still as wonderful to read now as it was thirty years ago!,"I have never forgotten this delightful book, which I first read while in 3rd grade, thirty years ago. I was so excited to see a reissue that I had to buy it! I must have read it twenty times during my grade school years. I was one of three Lutheran families living a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in the suburbs of Chicago and the book brought the lives, beliefs and culture of these warm and wonderful families to life for me. This was in the 60's, not the turn of the century, but the story is timeless. I wanted one of the pinafore dresses that the girls wore so badly that I badgered my poor mother for weeks until she made one for me. I loved it and wore it until it was practically a rag! What a happy memory and the return of an old, beloved friend."
3,All of A Kind Family was exciting.,"It was inperdictable, unlike other books were you can perdict what will happen, but some parts were very dull and it made you feel like you wanted to put the book down a stop reading. You can decide for yourself but that is what I think."
1,A Dissenting Opinion,I'm completely out of step with the rest of this book's adoring public. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my eight year old niece and after reading it wondered if this could possibly be the same book that received so many glowing reviews. I'm not usually the politically correct type but the rampant stereotypes and creepy uncle depicted in the story made my skin crawl. This book is far from charming; it's dated and inappropriate for contemporary audiences. My niece got another book for Christmas.
2,Incredibly Boring,I nearly fell asleep while reading this book. It only gets more than 1 star from me because of the somewhat predictable plot twist at the end.
5,"Wonderful, Just Wonderful",I finally sat myself down and read this book I bought over a month ago. I could hardly put it down. The book moves real fast so often like life itself. I kept flipping the pages wanting more and more. I thought of the characters in my past that reminded me of the various characters in the book. The book brought back a lot of memories of my own childhood. The book is everybody's story on some strange level. I want a role in the movie version! The book is wonderfully fantastic and the writing is superb.
5,Love and acceptance,"The author was very explicite. She soulfully drew me into the characters and their situations. The daunting obstacles the main character faced, things one would think no little girl should have to endure, actually made her stronger. She was able to accept her reality, forgive and not only love others but most importantly, herself."
3,A little sweet smelling,"I expected this to smell really good from the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with the smell it was too sweet and something else was mixed in, it was not a good match for me."
5,My favorite scent,This floral scent is perfect for my body chemistry. I have been wearing this perfume since 2003 and I have been hooked. It is hard to find in perfume stores in the U.S. so this is the place to purchase it. A unique scent that will make you stand out in a crowd.
4,Different!!,"This used to be my signature fragrance, and it was so different from what everyone else was wearing (Happy, Curve, Tommy Girl, etc...). It is a rich, creamy and (not too) heady floral, just right for daytime or evening wear. I had to stop wearing it when I became pregnant and everything that smelled like flowers revolted me. I made the mistake of wearing it to my SIL's wedding when I was 9 months along, and the smell made me so sick that I still cannot wear it, almost a year later. I miss this fragrance terribly and I have yet to replace it. If you like floral, and like to smell different from all the other women, I suggest Halloween.:)"
3,Nice scent,"I might have given this product more stars, but the scent is similar, if not identical, to the scent worn by someone I can't stand, and I couldn't separate the two. I couldn't even put it on--just gave it away. Sorry I couldn't be more objective."
5,Wonderful Fragrance,"very romantic and alluring fragrance, the price was very good! I would and do recommend this fragrance to others."
5,have been using it for 5 years!,"This is an amazingly subtle fragrance, perfect for someone who wants to be radiate fragrance but not overwhelm people around with their scent! I have been using it for over 5 years now and feel this is the only fragrance for me.after using this perfume, every other perfume smells overwhelming and artificial"
2,Nothing special!,"I did not find this perfume to be anything special or present itself as described. Very ordinary and cheap smelling, luckily the fragrance disappeared in a short amount of time. I would not recommend ""Halloween"" to anyone. I was extremely disappointed."
4,Not a Fad But a Change in Outlook,"I'm presently using Dr. Linden's book to transform the culture of my city so that to citizens we appear seamless. I used the paradigm of Frankenstein's monster. Other than his size, what makes him scary? He's covered with seams! And we are too, every time a customer (citizen) gets transfered from one department to the next to get their business done.Adopting a seamless approach is not a project for the squeamish. It is a culture change that will take years to put in place. The workbook is a great guide with lots of practical steps and wisdom to boot. Well-written with the lay person (his customer) always in mind, Russ Linden's concept and the book to put the concept into action are winners! Or perhaps the customer is the real winner. Win-win....hmmm...I like it."
5,An Adventure,"After reading this book, I want to be an adventurer too!I loved all of the stories, I was riveted. Ms. Cooke did an outstanding job of capturing Mr. Slick's love of discovery and exploration. You felt as though you were right there with him. I loved all of the old photographs, it really added to the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a good biography."
4,Nice ring...,This ring is beautiful and especial but is bigger than I thought ...so it looks heavy in my hand...I would have appreciated more a size more delicate....like it anyway.....
2,don't waste your money,"the first couple of days the charger worked fine. now it doens't work properly, nothing should fail so quickly after purchase, a definite do not buy."
4,the gift of books,"brought this book for my grand daughter and had it shipped to her address. she loved the book, the quality wa great and it came to her personally.Now that makes me the greatest grandmom in town.Thank you for making gift giving so easy"
3,Not Great,I got this because everybody I know has read and they all loved it. When I read it I expected it to be a great book. But it turned out to not have much of a problem and ended with the little problem just getting worse.
5,Awesome!,I could not put this book down. I I also read twelve and I am about to read anthoer book by Lauren Myrcale.
3,eleven,I thought it was good and exciting book. It had a lot of intresting friend problems. It was a cliff hanger and I don't like that. I want to know what happened in the end.
5,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is great for girls who need to know that they are not alone in the battle of being a preteen. This book was so good that I could relate to the characters. The story has a simple plot, but it has heart warming messeges that a girl could really use. Like friendships, first crushes, and older siblings. Winnies story is a reall winner. Oh, and if you liked this book, then you should read Are You There God It's Me Margaret?, and Starring Sally J. Freedman As Herself."
3,A disappointment,"This is more of a coffee table book. There is very little excitement when reading through the book. The book is even less exciting than the BBC documentary of the same account of Boeing and Lockheed competing for the winning design. Most of all, you don't sense the human factor, the human drama in this book. Contrast this book with the Skunk Work book by Ben Rich and you can see the difference. Again, this is just a coffee table book that you look flip once in a while and not a book like Mr. Rich's that you go back to for inspirational ideas."
4,great book! great references !,"At first, i've just planned to use this book only for my presentation and would sell it later but after i've got it, i've totally changed my mind.Tons of Thompson's great works with the explanation how great they are which help you more understand his style.i have to admit that you can find some contents and also images on the internet [i think the internet sources just took some contents from the book for showing or analyzing Thompson's style]Anyway, this book still provides much more deeper details which are incredibly amazing to collect!"
2,Really not 15 feet.,"It is sold as a 15 foot cord, but it is really only about 12 feet when stretched to its fullest. I didn't want a 25 foot, because I had that before, and it was wild when it got stretched out. I thought 15 foot would work fine (I even measured how far I could go with 15 feet), but this is not 15 feet."
1,Didn't work,"It looks like it's missing some connectors in the jack. When plugged into the phone (a basic, corded landline) I can hear others but they cannot hear me.Sucks."
3,Not what I expected,Personally I found this book rather dissapointing. The instructions are very perfunctory and often incomplete. Better instructions on most of the included tecjniques are available free on the web with a bit of searching. It is an interesting book to read but don't expect too much practical help.
5,I was sad when this book ended,"It took me a couple of tries to get through this book, but when I finally did, I was sad when it ended. Although the character of Charles is misguided, shallow, and in severe denial, I still found him fascinating. His friends, his scenery, his house, his food -- all are created so meticulously that I was absorbed into his world and story. He has created a fantasy world and even though reality is not at all measuring up, that doesn't deter him in the least! He continues to play his part as though the fantasy was reality."
3,Sea,Strange book. Very wordyInteresting in that One neededTo finish but it was not soSatisfying in the end
3,Egotistical to a Fault,"This novel is a portrait of egotism in the form of the diary of an individual so self-centered that, as in an earlier novel of Murdoch's, The Black Prince, even the accuracy of his narrative is suspect. This can be fascinating or not. In any case, Murdoch's realization of the central character, mercilessly sustained over the course of 500 pages, is convincing and must be definitive.For those not interested in exploration of egotism per se, unfortunately, the novel's dramatic development is far from convincing. Opinions seem to be divided as to whether this is explained and compensated for by Murdoch's using the narrative events as an artifice to explore philosophical views. I tend to think not."
3,Fascination,"A tangled tale acting like an undertow, irresistably drawing people on shore and readers to participate. Like the rocks on the shore, little changes, despite the seemingly overwhelming power of the sea."
2,Tiring Read,"I wanted to like this drawn-out tale, but it just didn't grab me. The writing is notable. However, the characters are not memorable or even particularly likable. I found it difficult to care whether Charles was able to win back his old love, or who might meet an untimely death. This is one of those books that I picked up again and again only to put down, feeling bored and vaguely dissatisfied."
2,Heavy Going,I found this book to be very ponderous reading with the descriptions going on and on. Characters did not become very real. The actions of Charles do not seem believable. I read this book because it was one that my book club had read before I joined. While I did not enjoy the book I think I would have been very interested in the book club's discussion of this book.
2,Weak,"This is the only one of Iris Murdoch's books that I've ever read. And I got the very strong impression that she had never met anyone who wasn't, for want of a better word, posh. All the characters in this book, even the non-Oxford non-theatre types, talk the same way, which makes the whole thing extremely unconvincing."
2,SHALLOW READ,"Just finished my first Iris Murdoch novel. I had heard what a great writer she was, oh what a disappointment. I felt that the story was very shallow; it was about an old guy who still thought he was young and his rather silly love affairs. I guess even Iris Murdoch didn't have the guts to end it on old Charles hitching up with a teenager, hence the hints about the two of them getting together."
5,Monster over the sea,"In my opionion this is Iris Murdoch's best book. While we are alwaysimpressed with her teaming world of characters and speculations wesometimes forget just how funny her books can be. The strange imageof the head of a fantastic, Renaissance monster hovering over the seaonly to reappear again when the main character visits a museum (andalmost faints) is really very funny. Not to mentions the ""haunted""house sequence by our suspicious hero."
1,"be careful, my child cut his finger on this toy",We received this toy as a gift for our 3 year old. He enjoyed playing with it for a couple of months (although not more than other cars). But today he cut his finger on the gears.I don't think exposed gears are appropriate in a toy that is commonly being used by toddlers.
2,Cute toy with durability issues,"Received this toy for a birthday. It's cute, but it only lasted a few mintues of play before breaking. Works by spinning up a flywheel which keeps the car going after you stop pushing it. My kids and I found that the main flywheel gear tends to slip after just a few pushes, and we can see that the contact between the gears is clearly worn a groove into one of the gears, allowing it to slip quite a bit. This was after only 10 minutes!Agree with the other reviewer that it isn't appropriate for little kids due to the exposed gears. And definitely keep this thing away from long hair!!"
2,poor customer service,The monkeys came out of a package - just thrown into a brown envelope. The monkeys came nearly 2 weeks later than the other 5 products I ordered and shipping was really expensive. I e-mailed to return the monkeys and received no reply from the company at all. Poor service...
3,Good for those natural artists,This is a good book for natural artist. It is a fun book to go thru. Would recommend. ok that is all
3,Hit or Miss: Depends on you,"These boots I bought over a year ago and I have worn them twice. They are just to ""chunky"" for me. The front of the boot is rounded and I prefer a pointy toe. The heel is also a bit thicker than I like. Also, they are HEAVY! I felt like Frankenstein when I wore them. You couldn't tell this from the website so it falls under a hit-or-miss. The boot gave the look of wearing an old Dr Marten Steel Toe... yikes!Overall, it was a good quality boot at a good price. Given how many times I have worn them... not a good buy."
4,"Read the ""fine print"" ;-)","This is my overall favorite Wendy Waldman album. I was worried that I'd have to burn a CD from my scratchy, old LP -- this one took a long time to come out on CD.As another reviewer mentioned, the volume is a little low on this one. That might stand out if you play it in rotation with others on a CD changer. Also, You can hear a little hiss on the quieter sections (especially noticeable if your wearing headphones). Still, this is better than my old LP ever sounded.And, if you owned the LP, you've probably read the ""fake"" tabloid articles on the front and back cover. You'll be happy to know that those articles have been kept for the CD, but you might need a strong set of glasses to read them. (Worth the effort!)"
5,"waldman creates wonderful music (not strange, despite title!)","This is a blast from the past for me, listening to Wendy Waldman again, as I did in 1980. Love her, love her, glad they got her out of the archives!! I have 2 of her albums, Strange Company and Love is the Only Goal, and I would recommend them highly!!"
3,"Nice album, terrible CD",So I was thrilled to see all Wendy Waldman's albums get reissued on CD. But the sound on all of em is TERRIBLE. The levels are so low...gotta crank up the stereo to hear anything. what's up with that? So so disappointing.
5,Great book of family history for me,"My parents got a copy of this book when it was first released. My mother is one of Tinker's (Charles Wayne Owens, actually) sister. I was finally able to get a copy a few years ago from Ebay for about $89. This book is a treasured possession. Many family photos and stories that I remember well and a real story of the life of a college football player. I love the pics of his wife and child, Brandi. They are still married with two other children, all grown and are grandparents now. Tinker is still just as crazy as he was in the book! Great stuff!"
1,"This product needs to ""GET LOST""","Sorry...I REALLY wish I could write a good review of this product, but if possible, I would be rating it with LESS than 1 star. I am extremely disappointed and currently packing it up for return.All previous reviews (until May 3rd) for this product were good so I was excited. However, upon receipt of the product and attempts to install it, I ran into many of the same problems that the reviewer below did and have been trying to get this product to work for 2 weeks with absolutely no luck and nothing but frustration and the run around by the manufacturer.I even hired a computer consultant with lots of experience installing similar products and he said that he has never had such a problem with a product before either.Don't waste your time or your money."
2,Many frustrations,"I had high hopes, but so far have met with frustration at every turn. First, after lots of wait times, the THIRD technical person from Garmin told me that the reason I couldn't get the darn software installed is that it will not work with Windows Media edition. Argggh. So, went to a computer with a different OS, but couldn't get the maps installed because the Amazon third party vendor order failed to send the ""unlock code"". Still waiting to see if I can get that. In the meantime, can't even try the GPS. And, the Palm software does not have catagory capacity on the datebook, which my OLD Palm had. Is the software moving backward?"
1,Only two episodes? Not worth the price!,"My kindergartner loves the Jumanji movie starring Robin Williams, and when I saw that there was an animated show based on the movie, I checked several different sites to see if there was a DVD of the entire show, seasons 1-3. Fortunately, we subscribe to an online movie rental site which has made all three seasons available for instant download and instant play and she has been watching them in order.I do not think this VHS is worth the price for only two episodes as Season One contains 13 episodes in all, as listed below:The PriceBargaining for TimeMasked IdentityRansom of RedheadMaster BuilderNo DiceLove on the RocksThe Law of JumanjiStormy WeatherEl Pollo JumanjiPerfect MatchThe GiftTruth of Consequently"
2,Disappointed!,"After waiting months for this book I also was very disappointed. Wife For A Day was a great book. Bride For A Night, unfortunately was not. I almost didn't finish it but I did hoping it would get better. I did not like Cairo's character. She was too indecisive. As an expert explorer, Duncan did some pretty dumb things. Even though their son had a high IQ, he seemed a little too smart for a four year old. The relationship between Graham and Phoebe did not seem real--I don't think anyone moves as fast as they did or after grieving for his wife for five long years Graham gets over her in a few days. Most scenes were short and clipped. I could go on but I won't. Sorry Patti this one just didn't do it for me. But I won't give up on you. I look forward to your spinoffs from Wife For A Day (Lauren Remington and Mike Flynns stories)."
2,Her Other Book Was Better,"This book was really boring. Duncan and Cairo(weird name) fight with each other over the past and then they fight again over their son, Dylan. Not real exciting but there were funny and good parts.I got to admit that the romance between them was sweet but Duncan and Cairo go hot and cold. One time they hate each other, in another time they're being real passionate and then they hate each other again. That's the part that killed my interest."
2,ho hum,"This wasn't a terrible book, but I did think the humor was pretty lame and silly. I love romantic comedy, but this just didn't fit my own sense of humor, and the plot struck me as awfully familiar, like this was like pretty much every other romantic comedy from Avon."
2,What happened?,I was so anxious for this book after I read Wife for a Day. I could not get into this book. I finished it only because I had to see if it got any better. I was extremely disappointed in this.
3,disappointing,I've read several of Ms. Berg's other books and like them. THis one I kept reading thinking it would get better. It did not. I'll continue to read Ms Berg but I may wait until her books hit the resale shops.
3,Adventurous hero,"The book is like a scene from The Mummy. We have an adventurous hero, a daring heroine and a darling 4 year old boy. Most of the story revolves about Duncan's expedition to find the legendary 'City of Gold'. The heroine, Cairo, was his wife for a night. They were married in Vegas and she had a son with him. The fact was, Cairo never told Duncan about his son, Dylan since she felt that he wasn't responsible enough to be a good father to her son. The story was funny and sexy. I loved Dylan for his Taekwondo moves and he keep breaking things around him. That's okay with me since he is such a darling and a handsome 4 year old indeed!This book will surely be a keeper for those swooning for Brendan Fraser or Indiana Jones macho type. But not for me, since sometimes the story just paced slowly. I am not a patient reader but I would surely recommend this for people who love bold and challenging theme."
2,no too impressed,"Good for a very very beginner, who has never lifted. nothing earth shattering though. Hindsight being 20/20 I would not spend the money again."
4,Great Instructional Video,"Positives: This video is great for people working on their technique for the bench press, shoulder press, squat, dead lift, and power clean. The video shows demonstration by men and women of various ages and sizes. This allows just about anyone purchasing the video to relate to someone demonstrating the lift.Negatives: The video quality is average.Conclusion: I think this is a great purchase if you are interested in performing barbell lifts correctly. Personally, I have always struggled with squats and deadlifts. However, after watching the video I am considerably more confident in my squat technique and I immediately doubled the amount I could deadlift."
5,"Love the book, buy the DVD !","I bought 2nd and 3rd Editions of Starting Strength, the book, read it before going to the gym. The DVD is even bettter because you can watch different body types instructed using the principals outlined in the book. People say it is repetitive because of this but I think its a strong point not a weakeness. Brings the book to life and worth every penny!"
4,Good companion for the book,"I like the Starting Strength book. This DVD is a good companion for the book. I have been able to learn the lifts through the book and the DVD. The DVD alone will leave you bereft of a number of major points that are there in teh book, the anatomy of lifting, the mechanics of the lift, various alternate excercises etc. The video quality is good and camera work isnt too bad either. Good buy"
5,Great for all levels experience!,"Mark Rippetoe does a great job of breaking down the individual movements involved in the ""major"" lifts. Whether you're just starting out or have been lifting for years, you can learn a lot from this video.I think this DVD is a great supplement to the book of the same name."
5,Excellent,"A great companion for the book by the same name. Rip knows his stuff. I recommend reading the book first, then watching the DVD. My back squat has improved dramatically as a result."
4,Very good overall,"Complements the book very well over all.Took 1 mark off as there is a fair fews reps obviously performed with poor form that Rip gives the OK on.apart from that, its great"
4,Useful,"Nice bonus to go with the book. Video tells more than words.Unfortunately the video quality is mediocre and sound mono, but it I don't think it matters that much."
5,This works,It has been awhile since I have down some power lifts I was all about the P90X workout for a year but then like everything became bored with the program. I bought the DVD so I could see the techniques and I have to tell you I didn't think the DVD was going to be this good. Great Detail that makes you perform the excercises properly. I also love the program short and sweet and a lot of fun. Also my arms have increased in size without doing any curls. This was something I was a little worried about. I am getting bigger everywhere and I like the newly added strength I have gained. Great DVD for any age buy it.
3,Good read for HR...,"... but only an average read for a seasoned Leader. Although, if you are looking for another read for the month it has some valid reminders."
3,"A decent film, nice follow up in 2005 edition.","This film tells the tale of 2 people in London who got challenged by Mcdonalds for slander, and actually fought back. I thought this film was a decent look into British law, and to think that a coperation could squash the voice of decent by threatening to sue, unheard of in the US unless gross neglegence is in play. Besides, the effort corperation would have to go through to get all the little guys would be difficult in this country, I guess it must have payed off in Britain. Essentially, the two people were able to fight a big expensive legal team and win About half of the claims filed against them, not bad. But also, they proved a bigger point that the british system was flawed, and legal representation needed to be provided to these civil actions. The 2005 follow up show them at the European court aguing this point, and winning it. Neat story, worth a watch."
4,Flawed but worthwhile and inspiring documentary,"Inspiring on a story level, if less so on a film-making level.Two working class British activists are sued by McDonald's for a pamphlet they put out accusing McDonalds of making unhealthy foods, exploiting its workers, etc. Under the archaic British libel laws, all the burden of proof is on the defendants, and somehow these two plucky, broke (if occasionally annoyingly nave) nobodies fight McDonalds to a stalemate in court, while costing McDonald's millions in legal fees, and causing them an absolute PR disaster.While the story is terrific, the re-enactments, especially of the courtroom scenes are awkward, and the over simplistic idealism of some of the couples' political theory (`why can't McDonald's simply give half of it's profits to their workers?') can be a bit much to take.Still, it's good to see something that makes you realize the little guy can win now and again. Worth it forthat bit of uplift and inspiration in a cynical time"
5,Sent wrong Color,"I purchased this from Amazon because I needed it right away. (I had them send it Overnight) I needed color Blue. It said in the listing color Dark Blue so I ordered it. When I got it the next day, ready to put in my new CD player.... I opened it and it was Granger Red. If you need the red, get this one. Make sure if you need Dark Blue, get the one that has DB in the Scosche Part Number (I Found This Out The Hard Way) Other than Amazon messing up, I went to another place (eBay) and bought one and this product worked Perfect. EXCELLENT INSTALL KIT!!!"
5,"CRC SL2552 Hydraulic & Jack Oil, 32 Fl Oz","CRC SL2552 Hydraulic & Jack Oil, 32 Fl OzGreat product and very handy to have around. Changing the pump oil in your jack is something most folk's never even think about but.. My tools last for yearsand get heavy use. I am very happy with the quality of this oil.Buy with confidence.RagenRat"
5,great cover!,I have cloth diapered 3 kids and this is the cover I have come back to time after time. I have tried many other covers and I just like these so much better! I have never had a problem with leaks as long as you have all the cloth diaper tucked into the cover (even overnight)
3,The authorized British translation of the 1983 Code.,"This is a translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law produced by the Canon Law Society of Great Britian and Ireland. It covers the entire revised Code and a few supporting documents. The translation is reliable and graceful, but is not widely cited in the United States. There is no commentary on the canons, and an index of canons must be purchased separately. The original Latin text of the canons is not provided. Overall, a respectable, but strictly utilitarian, production."
5,Really Good,"When I moved, somehow I lost my mother's deep dish pie plates. This solves the physical problem and the fact that it is Fiesta ware which I have a lot of, only makes me glad of it's durability."
3,flyfishing for permit,"this is a very pleasant book to read, detailing the author's experiences flyfishing for permit. i enjoyed reading it. however, this book is very light on the basics or essentials of flats flyfishing. it is not really much of a ""how-to"" book, either in terms of permit specifically, or flats fishing in general. a lot of species-specific books of this type also mention in passing other species you may encounter in the same waters, and differences in how those species may be fished. this book has very little of that as well. although i am glad i bought it, standing alone i would not consider this book informative enough for a beginner or definitive enough for experienced flats fishermen."
4,Good book but not long enough,"I thought this book was sweet and reminded me so much of the ""James Herriot"" era when doctors actually cared about their patients. I wish the author would write more books and make them longer. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, light read."
5,Book Report,This is a great book on Digital photography......Pick a used one up like I did (looked brand new). The book has a lot of clever tricks and tips that will get you up to speed very quickly.-Ray
4,"Awesome, more for the collectors though.","This little EP contains the first track, ""Vaka"", and a three track opus that clocks in at 12 minutes, often called Sigur 9. However, it is pressed on a three inch CD, making it somewhat of a hassle, (not playing on some CD players, etc.). Good news is that it has been pressed again with a DVD with all three of their videos on a full size CD. I suggest you buy that, since it's cheaper anyway. All in all, the extra is really good, so check it out."
2,No Drummer?!,"It is a shame that such a great voice is almost wasted w/this release. Doogie White one of the great voices of hard rock, decided to use a drum machine. It gives the whole CD a very mechanical feel. The vocals are great, overall a disappointing effort."
4,Great product!!,"My daughter loves this series. She likes to read with the CD, do the activity book and try to read those little story books all wihtout my help.. Great product overall!!"
4,hooked on phonics learn to read 1st grade,Hooked on phonics learn to read 1st grade edition is helping my step-son read better so hopefully he wont have to stay back this year
4,Very helpful product,"My 1st Grader is having trouble reading. He's been moving along in the right direction for months now, but he's been doing so at a slower pace than the rest of his class. We purchased this produce just a few weeks ago, but so far I'm a) very impressed with the produce itself; it's very easy to use and understand from a parental perspective, and b) I think it's really beginning to help my little 1st Grader in his reading. The ability to really read is starting to click. We hope this product better prepares him for 2nd Grade, so far, so good."
5,Hannah is over the reading hurdle!,"We just started this program with our 6 year old daughter, Hannah and she is doing phenomenally well! She has never had an easy time with reading but something about this format - whether it's the brief lessons or multi-sensory approach - is really working for her. I would highly recommend if your child is struggling with reading or if you just want a comprehensive program to use as practice and preparation for the school year ahead."
3,Not what I wanted at all... but still good.,"I was hoping for more pictures of the creatures. That's why I bought it. I was looking for a book about the Obakemono, but they aren't all covered here. I was looking for a book covering the Tsukumo-gami, as well. They aren't even mentioned. Still- it was a good book over all, just not what I was looking for. Needed color pictures."
3,Good for academic reference - too big to travel.,Great reference book. I wanted to take soemthing with me on a trip to Japan tho - this is far too bulky and too much detail.
5,Great CD at a great price,"I had bought the CD originally for only one song, but to my luck the whole album is very good."
4,Heroic Early Adopters Unite!,This book is Lord of the Rings with Walter Murch as Frodo. Too much of the book is focused on the INCREDIBLY HEROIC undertaking that was using FCP 3 on Cold Mountain. The author goes a little over the top with his love fest for Digital Film Tree. I thought this was going to be an in depth look at how Walter (lord of the edit) uses FCP. As well as in depth info about the editing of Cold Mountain and his editing process. Everyone has technical problems of their own. It isn't that much fun reading about Walter Murch's technical problems. I'm more interested in the creative side. There are too many books like this that focus too heavily on the tools and the technical problems. Though it is fun reading Steve Job's emails. For that it deserves 4 stars. Besides I can't bring myself to disrespect Walter with 3 stars.
3,"big fan of Murch, but not this book","If you're interested in knowing about using Final Cut for a feature project, this book won't really help you, because almost every trick, workaround, and difficulty that these guys had was with a version of Final Cut that's OLD (v.3, I believe)! Almost every problem they talk about in the book just isn't a problem anymore. And supposedly version 5 is appearing at NAB April '05.There are some interesting things about the filmmaking process and the editing of a picture in general, but Final Cut specifics are kind of moot. Murch's ""In the Blink of an Eye"" and also the ""Conversations"" book are great reads on his process and how he thinks about editing. Also, the Los Angeles Final Cut Pro Users Group (""LAFCPUG"") sells a DVD of Murch talking at one of the meetings.But again, if you want to learn about using FCP to do a feature, this really won't help you."
3,Not required reading,"Get this is book if you want to read all about...1. Walter Murch.2. Cold Mountain.3. What it was like to edit a feature film on consumer software that was not ready for prime time.4. The practical problems facing an editor.Do not get this book if you want to improve your editing technique. While Murch drops some nuggets of useful information here and here, I think that you have to go through too much irrelevant material to make it worthwhile. The lessons that Walter learned from FCP 3.0 are outdated, for the most part."
5,Simply the Best,"The above reviewer was probably an acting student at The Boston Conservatory. There, the standard text for senior year is Acting Power. That aside, the reviewer is correct. The book is the best you'll ever read on the techniques of acting. Forget Uta, forget Stanislavski, this book puts you in the mindset that what your scene objectives are are playable. You don't worry about what's behind you, you focus on what's ahead. Read the book and you'll see what I mean. Having written that, realize that you cannot really learn to act from a book. You have to work at it. This book just helps you come from a realistic standpoint."
3,smelly bear,"I received this bear and it smelled like curry or something (is this seller from India?). The bear is cute but I cannot stand the smell. The bear did not seem new - little dust fuzzies everywhere - - oh, and did I mention the smell? I will keep it anyway, since I had to pay for shipping & will wash it... I will stick to buying items directly from Amazon..."
4,Still nice even after 10 years,"Ok, I have to admit that the first time I read this book was about ten years ago, when I was fourteen. Yeah, I'm a big girl and yet I took it off my shelf and read it again after all this time. The story somehow stuck in my mind, the creepy cover haunted my memory.After reading more grown up stuff for the past years, I felt like I had to lower my thinking a bit to get into this teenage world, but I have enjoyed the story once again.Trish is being stalked by a man with a thousand faces, and she isn't safe anywhere, even in her own head. The mall, a place of fun and games is suddenly a maze of deadly possibilities, and chased by a madman, real or not, is quite a scary ride.Very good book, for any age! Enjoy"
4,"Different from most of her books, but still good....","This book was a little different from most of her books, but still good. I realy liked the characters, storm. and Imogene and Nita. Because, I have two best friends (they are twins) who realy remind me of them. You'd think this would be realy unrealistic but, in fact, it's the total opposite. It's very beleiveable. The character, Athan, REALY freaked me out. Eww... he was a sick pervert. This book is very descriptive, and makes you feel as if your there. It also has a lot of action. It takes alot for books to scare me, but this one did."
3,Mall Madness,Trish thinks she has the perfect job working at the Mall.She works in Muffin Mania.Her friends Nita and Imogene work in the Mall as well.Yet suddenly things are not so great.There's Bethany her boss who seems to want to make Trish Miserable.Alsostrange things are happening like things are disappearing fromthe stores.Then There's the crazy guy who keeps following Trishand a very scary phone call.When Trish accidently get locked inthe Mall.She realizes the Mall is'nt as fun or safe as she thought because someone is watching and waiting to kill.Who knewthe Mall could be such a scary Place.
5,Awesome,"I've been a fan of Mrs. Cusick's books for a few years now, and when I read this book last year, I was amazed. It is a really captivating story and I love it. Hopefully soon, I will buy that book and add it to my personal library at home.She is an outstanding writer and I hope she contiues to write more books for teenagers like me who love her books."
5,This book reveals the horrors that a mall can hold.,"You usually think of a mall as a fun, happy, safe place to be but in this book Richie. T. Cusick reveals the shocking horrors of the Mall. A worker at the mall is suddenly being stalked every minute of the day. She finds little surprises waiting in the wings of the mall. There are also two mysterious young men who always seem to be around her. This book is for anyone seeking spine tingling fun suspense, and romance"
3,"Good pointers, but needs some work","This book has some very good ideas and can point you in the right direction. However, they would have been better off going into a bit more detail in some of the examples. For instance, with a bit more Sketcher information, you could work along with their problems without all the guesswork. My feeling is that they teach you as if you already have mastered the subject; I spent several hours pouring over the PTC reference books. It's a good reference for the intermediate user, but by no means is it the end-all of Pro/E books."
4,A Good Read For Coxswains,"As a coxswain, I found Seat with a View to be a very good read. Rowers may not find much information about training and the like, but coxswains can be put inside the head of Steven Segaloff as he deals with his doubts and dreams while trying to become a member of the US Mens Rowing Team which will represent the States in Atlanta in '96. Segaloff is faced with many issues which a great many coxswains face. Segaloff fights to make weight and not kill himself in the process, he must deal with keeping his seat in the Mens eight, and he must deal with victory and defeat. Rowers expecting a book which will reveal the ""secrets"" of the US National Team may be disappointed, but coxswains, novice and experienced, will find a story to which they can relate and in which they can find inspiration."
4,Copco travel Mug,This is the way to go if you like a big cup of coffee. Don't leave home without it!! Would have given it 5 stars if the mouth opening had a closure on it.
2,"Not a fan of plastic mugs, I guess.","It fits in the cup holder and holds a lot. It's plastic inside and doesn't keep coffee or tea hot for very long and because it's metal outside you can't put it in the microwave. It's OK for a short drive to work, but not great for long drives where you want you coffee to stay hot."
3,you get what you pay for,Nice cups but the coffee does not stay hot as long as others and the lid has no cover for the hole to drink out of and has a tendency to leak alot. otherwise they are ok in a pinch
4,Sloppy Joe,"I bought the 24 ounce mugs for those days when the regular size mug is just not enough coffee. They still fit into my car cup holder, but there is no mechanism to seal the lid - so be careful not spill. It's a great price for two mugs, but I wouldn't buy more because I don't need a potential wardrobe change in the morning."
2,"Not that great, spend a little more","I thought these were way too big, but if you want something huge, then this would be good for you. It felt cheaply made and wouldn't fit in my cup holder for a Honda car."
4,Awesome for the price!,"For the price you definitely can't beat it, 24oz capacity, stainless steel, and easy to clean. The comments about the handle are mostly correct, it does feel a little flimsy, but after almost a year of using mine four days a week with a full cup it's held up fine. I find that I tend to only use the handle to carry to and from my vehicle, but after I sit down at work I rarely use it, so for me a version without the handle would probably work better. If I had any suggestions to improve it I would want a rubberized base, and have the lid lock into place."
5,GREAT!!!,These large mugs give me enough warmth for those long drives to work. They even fit in my cup holders in my truck!
3,OK,The only draw back is it does not close. Liquid can splash out but is a nice size for larger quantity of liquids.
2,not spill-proof,Watch out: Lid lacks a spill-proof lock. Suits are exposed to risk of coffee stains.
2,Get Ready for Spillage,"Bought for my wife and she does not like it. This thing is too big and clunky for her small hands.The sipper part does not close to prevent spillage, it's permanently open. This sucks for coffee drinking.Cup does not fit in top rack of dishwasher due to size.It IS top heavy and the bottom is too narrow so it rocks back and forth in our 2006 Honda Odyssey cup holders. Needless to say, we no longer use it in the car after 3 'splash' spills.I thought the price was great, until I walked through Wal Mart and found better cups with closing tops for five bucks also. What a waste of money. I guess I can use it out back for lemonade or cool drinks in the summer.You can get better elsewhere."
3,Travel cup pair,"The size is great but it doesn't keep cofee hot long enough. Liquid will spill out if tipped. I bought an Oxo cup which is smaller, but much better quality."
1,"It will spill, look-out, Jill.","The 'Thermal & Travel' mugs, is an odd name for this offering. The mugs have a mouth piece, for to drink from.... But u can never close it!!! Most mugs u see, like at the nearby Walgreen's or Rite-Aid stores, or even at 7/11 stores, most mugs have an 'open/close' slide piece, so u can control the mug's mouth piece. But not our Thermal Travel Mugs, the ones that we find here. The mouth hole stays open, and there is no if-and-or but, about it. The heat will come out, and spilling, well, spilling will never have come so easy, as w/ this mug(s) here. Not recommended. (Boooooo.)"
1,Poor Construction,"First time I used one of these, the bottom fell off and the entire thing pretty much disassembled itself, spilling scalding hot tea all over my hand. Obviously, I'm not too pleased with it."
2,coffee mugs,"These coffee mugs worked very well at keeping my coffee warm for a long time. The only problem I had with them was the seal between the aluminum at the top and the plastic insert into the mug---when I washed the mugs, water got caught in between these two panels."
4,watch it on sat. morning,"i did not watch this till the summer of '78,because i was watching something else,till i had seem them,so many times that i got bored,so i watch this show and i could kick myself for not watching sooner.i did not like liko,i thought that he was not important to the show.(and i still do not liek him).i would recommend this show and a couple of other ones to other people."
1,Space Academy: The Complete Series,"4'th dvd was defective / the 1'st chapter would kick the dvd player back to the intro, of the DVD. was not happy because this was a show that i loved as a kid.NOW waiting for re fund in my bank acountss'your's: ark3007"
5,It has to start somewhere,"Please take note that Dr Fiore is a pshycologist and not some kind of psychic or anything like that. She was very new to this spirit release stuff. Imagine, she puts someone into hypnosis for a session and finds herself talking not to the client but to someone else, this must have scared the s__t out of her. She was the first to write about this almost 20 years ago. Just think what her friends and associats would think. Please do not compare this work with others. They all studied her work. If you plan on doing therapy of this kind, PLEASE, PLEASE read and study as much as you can, get this book and all the others. IF YOU HAVE FEAR, DON'T DO IT!!!"
4,A Very Good Study,"Very good introductory book not only for the laypersons but also for the healthcare providers in medicine, psychology, and psychiatry etc. The case studies provided in the Unquiet Dead are a good sampling of what is happening in the spirit-attachment area.However, the book exclusively focus on the benign forces and it fails to stress, or actually, totally ignores the existence of evil or malignant entities. I am in the unique position of talking about this book/subject not only from personal experiences but also from the perspective of a retired medical professional. It is high time the medical science catches up with this extremely important source of medical and psychological disorders.Mohinder Goomar, M.D., F.R.C.S., author, Secrets of Life, Beyond..."
4,One of Classic Works on Spirit Possession,"Reading Dr. Edith Fiore's ""An Unquiet Dead"" (1987) is quite fascinating and a classic. I first stumbled upon Dr. Fiore when she wrote a foreword for William J. Baldwin'sSpirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manualand came across this work, which is fairly a short book of 160+ pages and quite easy to read.I've found this book to be useful for those to know more about spirit possessions, and one of good introductory works on the subject."
4,very interesting book,I was all set to dislike this book ...but found it very interesting. It raises many interesting theories & points.
1,Not as advertised,"This is a mid-calf sock with no cushioning. Poor quality, and definitely NOT over the calf. I cannot understand where the five star reviews are coming from........"
4,Good quality,"It is a good quality product, very good in price as well. The brand name right over the toes is quite anoing but in the end it stay inside the shoes."
2,Dissapointed,"The saying ""You get what you pay for"" applies to this purchase. There is nothing wrong with the socks, the cotton is on the thin side, but soft. The quality of the spandex or elastic support does not hold up very well."
1,Couldnt make sense of it,Couldnt get my attention and I couldnt make sense of anything in this movie Tho I didnt watch it all the way so maybe the last hour was something
3,Temp fix,"NOT dishwasher safe. I knew this going into it, but would definitely prefer a stainless one. If u have the time to find one that is stainless I would recommend getting that instead."
5,Perfect,This is an excellent replacement part for my mixer. Love it! It works just as if it were the orginial one before it broke a while ago. I should have ordered this one sooner!
3,"Wire whip,","This is supposed to be the replacement part, but falls short. It is not as long as the origianl whip and does not mix the bottom of the bowl. Very dissapointed. I mathced the model number on the mixer to this listed part."
2,This is definitely not like the original wire whip.,"While it fits and does an ok job, it is not really comparable to the original in its material and workmanship. It even looks marred (flawed) right out of the box."
2,Bad Product,"i purchased this thinking i can have two whips to use so i don't have to keep washing the whip to use for the next batch. unfortunately,it was a great disappointment because the wires came off after a few uses. i couldn't believe it since it didn't even last more than 3 mos of usage! wanted to return it but thought i just had a bad lemon until i read the reviews again! yes, quite disappointed that Kitchenaid would produce such cheesy product!"
2,they don't make them like they used to!,"I ordered this wire whip replacement for my KitchenAid mixer which I have had since the 1970's. It's still a wonderful mixer, but needed the whip. Apparently, today's whip isn't made the same. The design allows the whip to hang down too far into the bowl so it drags against the bottom and sides. Not a good thing!The whip was a good price and was delivered on time, so there is no complaint about that. My money was refunded when I returned the item with no problems. However, I still need a replacement whip which fits."
5,Great replacement for my mixer's original wire whip,"I've had my KitchenAid mixer for at least 10 years now, and the original whip had deformed enough so that it would make contact with the mixing bowl during operation. Found the replacement here on Amazon, and for the price, it's like getting a brand new mixer again. Fits perfectly and works exactly as the original, although as one reviewer notes, it does come with a prominent ""Hand Wash Only"" tag attached whereas the original had no trouble going in the dishwasher. Still, if I had known these were available at such a low price, I would have bought a replacement a long time ago.Want to also congratulate KitchenAid and Amazon on the ""frustration free packaging"". The item arrives in a KitchenAid cardboard box. Open it, and there's your part - no silly human-proof plastic to cut through. Bravo!"
5,As good as new.,This looks and works exactly like the original. Very heavy duty. Feels and weighs about the same as the original. Hopefully will last another 10 years! We've abused these whips with lots of different food concoctions and the shipping was faster then advertised.
4,FIT THE BILL,"AFTER 13 YEARS OF USE, MY WHIP BECAME MUCH SMALLER.IT WAS THE RIGHT PRICE.FIT THE MACHING PERFECT,WOULD RECOMMEND THERE REPLACEMENT PARTS"
5,KITCHEN AID WIRE WHIP,I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR MY MOTHER-IN-LAW AS A GIFT AND WE ARE ALL VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT! EXCELLENT SERVICE!
4,Seems a bit flimsier than original whip,"We just bought this as a replacement for one that came with the mixer almost 7 years ago. This is the right size for my model. I'm sure it will work fine (I only tried it in a dry bowl), but I'm having trouble with the seemingly lesser quality of this replacement whip. My original whip was 100% stainless steel and weighs 4.5oz. This new version has a connector socket that feels hollow, perhaps? It weighs only 3.3oz.So if you are purchasing a replacement for an older whip,don't expect an exact replica (like I did). I'm trusting that this will work as well as my older one."
2,aluminum gets pocked,"This wire whip is a disappointment because it's not made out of stainless steel, as was the original. It's some form of aluminum which gets pocked when it soaks in dishwater. This happened the first time I handwashed it! Don't dare put it in the dishwasher."
1,Inferior to the original,"I was extremely disappointed with this whisk. It is NOT stainless steel like the original one. The original one lasted me a few years. This one started breaking within weeks of purchase. The two outside tines keep coming off. It is a piece of junk if you ask me. I am not one to complain about things, but for the price, this stinks!"
3,Not nearly as good as the original,So far it has held-up however it must be wiped after every washing since the metal oxidizes.I should have followed my gut and listened to the reviews because they were right...shame on Kitchenaid to only offer something like this.
4,Met my expectations,This mixer wire whip met my expectations. It appears to be as good as the original which recently had a broken sprong. The only way this new one differs from the original is the metal base appears to be aluminum vs. a stronger metal on the original whip. I noticed a bit of oxidation from sitting in water as an aluminum pan will do when water sits in it a long time. But functionally it is good and I was pleased with the price.
2,Broken within 2 years,Purchased whisk and used to make frostings. The weld broke within 2 years. Do not purchase especially if you mix heavier ingredients.
4,Not as good as the OEM,This one is not dishwasher ok...says it will discolor..the original didn't and held up for 15 years under moderate usage. Overall seems ok...is the current form of OEM it's just that Kitchen aid has rather disappointingly CHEAPENED OUT!
4,whip it good!,Did not get one with the original mixer. Be careful as KitchenAid has several different sizes; make sure you get the right one.Well made and durable.
3,KitchenAid wire whip replacement review,"The replacement wire whip for the KitchenAid mixer fit the machine well. But it is clearly not the same quality as the original wire whip that came with the machine. The base of the whip is a cheap metal casting and the wires are attached differently into this base as compared to the original.I will use this replacement, but I would be shocked if it lasts even half as long as the original did due to it's cheaper design.Nevertheless, it is probably worth the price if it lasts for a few years."
2,Cheap; should be stainless,"Shame on me. I assumed that this piece was stainless, given that it's a KitchenAid, and I put it in the dishwasher. If I touch it now, my hands turn black so I hardly ever use it. Would rather pay a little extra and get something stainless that I can wash in the dishwasher with all the other parts."
2,replacment wire whip,This wire whip is suppose to be the correct replacement for my model ksm90 but it is very difficult to attach and even more so to remove. I could of removed my old whip blind folded with one hand tied behind my back but this new one you have to get your hands dirty and push and twist and pull for a couple of minutes before it finnally releases.
3,not as sturdy as original,This whisk was a replacement for the original that came with the mixer back in late 70's. The old one finally broke a tine a the top connection. We used it for all baking-type recipes. With the new one three tines bent at the top on the first try. It's nowhere as solidly constructed as the original. I am using the original white flat blade except for beating eggs.
5,Phenomenal Whipped Cream & Meringue,"Whether you want to make chocolate mousse, or whipped cream for cakes, cream puffs or to top a pie, the Wire Whip attachment for the KitchenAid Stand Mixer gets the highest marks. Egg whites are easily whipped into meringue or to be folded into waffles, souffles or cakes. Consistent results with ease. If you like to bake or make desserts, I highly recommend it."
1,Kitchen Aide Artisan beaters,It was not the right size for my Kitchenaide mixer which is a Artisan and cannot tell by your description which beater to get but these two I ordered does not go to the bottom of my bowl so not happy at all.
1,Wrong Size,"After researching several sites to make sure that I was ordering the correct replacement whip, I was directed to order this one: K45WW. But when it arrived, it wasn't the right one. It was at least a half-inch shorter than the whip that came with my KitchenAid Mixer, a K5SSWH. If anyone out there knows the correct whip, I'd be glad to hear about it!"
2,not as sturdy as the original,"I was very disappointed when I received this whisk. My original had bent, and was barely usable but when I compared the two side by side, this was made of thinner gauge lighter weight wire, leaving it even more likely to bend in the future. I expected better from kitchenaid."
1,Total rip off,"I bought this in November 2011 to replace the original one which lasted a long time- maybe ten years with regular use. It is cheaply made and the part that attaches is some sort of plastic. The outside whips broke in less than 4 months and when I tried to return it, Amazon replied that the window for returns had expired even though it says 1 year guarantee. What is the point of having a great mixer when the replacement parts are so unreliable and cheap. So frustrating when an iconic brand sells out."
2,Not fit for Artisan Stand Mixer KSM150PSBW,"I recently ordered this wire whip to replace the old one for my Artisan Stand Mixer KSM150PSBWAccording to kitchenaid website, the correct part number is K45WW, which is this one.As soon as it arrived, i found out this wire whip is much bigger than my old one.My old wire whip that come with artisan unit is 5.94 inch long and 4.62 inch wide, and the new one is 6 inch long and 4.94 inch wide. It is much too wide and can not clear from the bowl.I contacted kitchenaid about the issue, their final reply is ""The K45WW is the correct wire whip for your KitchenAid stand mixer. The part you were sent could possibly be the incorrect part. We would recommend exchanging the part for the correct one, from where the part was purchased.""The good thing is i buy from amazon, so return is very easy :)"
3,They don't make them like they used to.,"I bought this as a replacement for a 20 year old mixer. Instead of stainless steel like the original part, it's aluminum or some lightweight, cheap alloy. It will work, but it won't last like the old one."
1,Wrong info,This piece did not fit my KitchenAid mixer; I did read the description carefully!! I was quite unhappy to waste money and time.
3,kitchenaid wire whip attachment,This gift item was returned as we ultimately ended up purchasing a Kitchenaid model that came with the attachment.
4,KitchenAid Beater K45WW,Amazon delivered my replacement as promised. I am satisfied with my purchase. Good alternative place to shop for items.
4,Kitchen Aid Wire Whip,"I recently purchased a replacement wire whip for my Kitchen Aid mixer from Amazon.com. The best part is that is was cheaper to order on-line from Amazon.com that to order it where I live. The only difference is that the original wire whip I had was heavier, but the new one works great. Thanks"
4,Bird book,I bought this for a friend who is into gardening.She never commented on the book.Was it for the birds?joe
2,Not what I expected,This book was not as detailed and Bible-oriented as I expected. It didn't use enough scripture to back up the statements.
5,Works like a charm,The new battery for my camcorder was just what I needed. I am able to use my camcorder again.
3,It may be spectacular or it might suck,I don't remember watching this but the games are great. 3 stars is all I can give it. It may be spectacular or it might suck.
4,Fast Paced Space Opera Serial,"It's the cheese wiz of science fiction, but extremely well done for the genre. The actors sometimes pose comic book style like statues because there is no time for subtlety with the nonstop racing plot. If you like a good fast paced Flash Gordon serial this is the state of the art today."
2,rambler,"sort of rambles through a plot, not really entertaining considering the actors were better than the script or director. They had to dumb down considering the roles I've seen them do in other films."
2,Acting is terrible,"This is a low-budget science fiction movie. The story has some interesting parts but nothing, particularly good. I will say that it did not drag out but kept my interest going.However, without a particularly good story what movie need are good acting, special effects and filming.Here what let is down to me was much of the acting. Very poor I thought. The only one I thought who did a good job was Robert Patrick.The special effects were poor, the filming poor but adequate.Overall nothing much"
3,conduit bending book,"book is fine, seemed to be a fair price...bought it for during tech school. good for teaching you basic bends and learning about different types of benders...does not help with other difficult bends, for example; running an exposed pipe rack keeping couplings in line to make look professional and evenly spaced, it will not teach you or show you how to calculate for parallel offsets or parallel 90s."
5,The standard book for EMT bending techniques,"I highly recommend this book. It has given me the knowledge to teach myself how to make better bends. It takes the guesswork out bending and saves EMT. It is well written and includes examples and problems (with answers) to work out on paper or real EMT so you can get actual experience. The spiral binding is a plus as you can lay it flat, on the page you're on, while you work. Anybody who doesn't have someone to teach them bending should definitely buy this book as well as those who need a reference book while being taught."
5,Must Read!,This bohemian-style poetry is a great read...kick back and discover the cosmos with elegant imagery or laugh out loud at science fiction parodies! Has it all! Check it out!
4,Brewer's British Royalty-A Phrase and Fable Dictionary,"This is an excellent, thoroughly readable, book on the British Royalty and related subjects. It is very blunt, at times, calling it like it is/was! In the back are 37 charts, pedigrees, etc., on the earliest kings of Kent, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Mercia, and so on, the most extensive collection of such information I have ever seen. It is a treasure for anyone doing genealogy on British royalty, and the charts alone are worth the price of the book. Most highly recommended!"
1,SKINHEADS ARE NOT RACISTS,"It's so stupid, we skinheads are just as much different as other people! To be a skinhead has nothing to do with being racist!"
4,A Must-Read,I found out about this book on someone's blog and was not disappointed. This is a very well written memoir that reads almost like poetry. I truly enjoyed it and highly recommend it to others. He is real.
4,Awesome Book,"This book is very easy to understand and use. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to free themselves of negativity, poor self-image or any blocks holding them back from success in any form."
5,Core Transformation: Reaching the Wellspring Within,This is an amazing book. It solved some long standing problems of mine with ease. I was pleasantly surprised by how right the author got the issues I face.
2,"If I knew where the ""Core"" was?","I had seen this author on a TV show and also found suggestions to her philosphy and teachings at some widow/dating sites.I bought the book and started. I am a widow and have been struggling for about 2 years now.The concept is right on. I have been in-therapy several times in my life, including now.The books concept is the same except it has a feel of ""Generation X Therapy"" meaning a quick fix for todays going, going, gone generation.It is too hard to practice what is preached alone.The author has numerous followings and physical sites that one can go to and recieve gentle help but it truely is just like going to therapy.I don't believe the philosphy works as it is displayed here and wouldn't recommend the purchase of this book."
3,Banjo music from the Ozarks?,"Obviously the makers of this album are trying every way possible to keep it going. They've called it Banjo Music of just about every place. Now they want you to think this music is from the Ozarks? Some of the songs are, but some of the songs have never been heard of in the Ozarks except by a few who had this album when it came out in the sixties. One song in particular, ""Goodman's Coonhound"" was an original written by banjoist Billy Faier, and the song stayed in his repetorie until this album came out in the sixties. The title is misleading although the music is good."
3,NuLooq Not Bad,"I needed to download newer software than came with the device because of a recent upgrade to OSX10.5. The device is either more limited than I thought it would be, or its real power remains hidden. I still can't get it to change my brush size in CS3, which is like the main thing it's touted as being able to do. It is, however, the BEST way to make one's way around Google Earth."
1,What a rip off!!,"I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac.Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product.I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech.What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!!!"
3,No longer supported by Logitech,"This was a good product ... as long as Logitech was supporting it. It still works fine, but NOT in Photoshop CS4. So if you plan to use such a device with CS4, buy something else."
1,Don't bother,This is worthless. Don't buy. Basically every function it performs is just as easily accessible in photoshop/illustrator.
2,Does not work on Windows,"This tool feels great in hand. You don't twirl the ""collar,"" but simply apply rotational pressure. I'm sure this subtle movement would minmize chance for repetitive stress injury. I just wish it worked on Windows!"
4,Great tool,"This product was not the godsend that everyone made it out to be at first (the tool dial software has been discontinued because it was not what people expected and not nearly as efficient as it was initially made out to be), but it is a very handy tool that can really streamline your workflow and keep you from having to constantly switch from keyboard to mouse to pen to mouse to keyboard etc. I use it all the time with my graphics tablet and pen. Using the pen to do the editing and this to do the navigating (zooming in and out, scrolling around, changing brush size, navigating history states, etc), I can remain more focused on my work.This is not a revolutionary way to work, but it does help to increase efficiency and speed up workflow.If you are a Windows user you should be prepared to download the drivers from Logitech, since the last I heard it was still being shipped with Macintosh software only."
3,Nulooq and Photoshop CS3,"I was more than pleased with the operation of this device with Photoshop CS2. I just upgraded my Photoshop to CS3. Now the Nulooq device no longer works. I called Logitech about the problem. I was informed that Nulooq does not work with Photoshop CS3. A fix is in the works with no expected delivery date. A there is not beta software at this time. If you are used to using the Nulooq with Photoshop, I recommended not upgrading to CS3 until Logitech has a fix."
3,I've heard this before...,"Made in UK in 2003, Serial# MCCD-520, Playing Time 66:28What we have here, folks, is nothing else than a sampler from the 2-disc set ""Then & Now""; while the original release featured a different concert on each disc (the 1974 California Jam concert on 1, and material from the 1997-8 tour on the other), ""Fanfare"" blends tracks from the 2 concerts on 1 disc.Of the 12 tracks, tracks 2,5,6,7 and 8 are from the Cal Jam concert (the others are from the 1997-8 tour); but because the recording quality is vastly different between the 2, I found it a bit annoying to not have the 2 ""sections"" separated.That being said, the performances are quite interesting in their own right. If you don't have ""Then & Now"", perhaps ""Fanfare"" will entice you to get it; personally, I suggest you take the plunge and grab ""Then & Now"" instead: it's over 2 hours of musical history in the making!"
5,Mark Twain and Keillor,"This is a neat live Keillor show that has you feeling as though you are in the Mark Twain house in Harford Connecticut. Very personal views of Twain with wonderful comparisons and observations by and of Keillor. Different than the usual Garrison Keillor Prairie Home Companion Show, a genuine trip into history with Keillor's usual irreverant flare for truth and comedy."
4,Pre-requisite for Implementation,"Virtually all of the content in the book is in some other format on his website . He could have done what Philip Greenspun did with ""Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing"" and make the exact same content available online, but I'll only give Jakob minor points off for that. What is key, and I agree with Jakob on this point, is that people read this book, in order to grasp the concept of web usability, before they actually engage in the implementation of web sites."
5,"Classic book, does not need a review.","This book is a classic, and also a bestseller on its area, like the Design Patterns book.Its awesome value for money, and very beautiful with many coloured web pages reproduced.I am glad the web is changing in this direction.I recommended to the whole company. I wish companies gave it as Christmas gift to employees generating content to the web."
1,Talk about a waste of time!,"Three points to illustrate why you should not buy this book:1) Jakob Nielsen does not understand frames. Plain and simple. Few people do. Frames are not the answer to everything, or even to most things, but they are an incredibly useful addition to the web designer's arsenal if used well. It is easy to use frames poorly. Hard to use does NOT equal bad.2) Jakob Nielsen's opinions are held WAY too strongly for him to be even the remotest bit convincing as a guru. Gurus are about helping you to find yourself. Jakob just shouts at you and hopes you'll find him by the noise.3) In amongst all the b.s. statistics, it would have been nice to see some nuts and bolts. If you want useful, buy some other book."
4,Pretty good,"This was one of the first usability books I bought. It was great, and I couldn't believe someone wrote all of these ideas down. It _is_ a good book. It is well written, and he does a good job of illustrating his examples.However, for as much usability testing that Jakob must do, he provides little data to back it up. Perhaps hard data was not a requirement for web usability books written in 1999/2000, but it will have a more difficult time standing up to books written more recently."
4,"Well, It is Good Guildeline but a bit out of date","I admire that Jakob Nielsen point out that a lot of graphic take longer time to download. It did help us as a webmaster to try to reduce / optimize the graphic size.However, the recent website trend is always moving toward nice-looking design. We must balance the use of graphic and text and not only try to reduce the graphic element.Last point, I still seriously think that a clear website architecture and easy navigation is the main ingredient of a good website. That is why I give this book 4 star"
3,"usable web, un-usable book","A valuable collection of design wisdom, as one would expect.Too bad this book is nearly impossible to use!- Although the screen captures provide wonderful examples, there are so many that they start to become obnoxious interruptions, obliterating the ""big picture.""- The gutters are so narrow that it's physically tiring (if not painful) to open the book wide enough to read (without breaking the binding).If you keep up with the author's AlertBox and devhead articles, save your money and your strength."
5,A lot of good sense.,"By thinking of a website as an interface instead of a means to directly deliver entertainment or complex content the value of the Jakob Nielsens's guidelines becomes more obvious.Browser incompatibility issues, unsupported file types, and the prevalence of modem dial-up-connections makes the internet and website design a challenge. Simple and usable websites are an even bigger challenge, which is why too few exist. But what a refreshing relief they are when happened upon.If more websites adhered to the Jakob Nielsen way of thinking ( as it is mine ) the internet would be much more useful.Steve Krug's `Don't Make Me Think' should also be read, and digested."
1,Contradictions from the opening chapter to the end,"Do yourself a favor, if you're used to Linda Weinman's clear, concise writing, stay very far away from this mess. Mr. Nielsen may know an awful lot about creating web sites and keeping them simple, but he doesn't have a clue about writing a book. Rather than explaining things in layman's terms, he seems overly concerned with expressing his great intelligence to the detriment of the book's continuity and accessibility. Good topic- bad author."
2,verbose,"Exceptionally verbose. While there may be some redeeming value to all the case studies mentioned, you could get the same results from the authors web site, and save the bucks."
2,Not what I expected ...,"I totally agree with all of Jakob Nielsen's ideas on usability. However the book itself is really only a copy of everything you can find on his website and more surprisingly, the web version is much more readable. The book is not very amusing to read, to many web page screenshots tend to brake your lecture process and force you into constant page flipping."
4,"From a user, not a designer: Yes!","I picked this book up because I do create web pages for classes I teach. But, I am definately not a web designer. As a user, I found myself agreeing constantly. If designers followed JN's precepts, the web would be a better place.It seems so obvious and simple. But clearly it's not, as so many web designers violate the most basic principles.If you do design web sites, do your users a favor: read and follow JN's principles."
5,Great book!,"This book does a great job summarizing all the learnings of Web design & usability over the years. You can dive into the details (pixel size suggestions for various elements) or you can skim and get a summary of key learnings. The pictures are the best part. Instead of telling you to check out a site, you can see it right there. That is of huge value."
3,not the practice of simplicity,"This book conatins great tips, about how to make your webpage more usable. The authors main point is the practice of simplicity. The only problem is, that he himself did not practice simlicity. He goes on for pages about a signle topic explaining it from 4 diffrent angles. Nielsen is on target with all of his advice, but there is just not enough information in this book to make it a must buy."
4,Must-read for all would-be web designers,"Nielson clearly explains important design considerations for all web designers and developers. His theme throughout the book is that every design decision you make must be in the interest of helping to communicate information to the reader. His basic messages are: There are too many sites on the web that display distracting, if not confusing, visual elements on their pages. Learning the technical details of web page implementation is not enough. You must also understand how to effectively provide information to your site's visitors.As you progress through each chapter, he'll illustrate bad examples and then suggest improvements for them. Some very good examples of what he feels is effective design are also presented."
1,For the Simple-Minded Web Designer,"While this book has a few good points, the majority of it reverts the reader back to the Web design days of 1995. Technology and bandwidth have increased the Web's capabilities, and there are many, easily-navigable Web sites that employ very little from Nielsen's thesis.He seems to be a small-minded man with an affinity for himself, especially considering the ""I Love Me"" page on his site. Someone so close to the engineering aspect of Web technology does not need to be given that much credit for design."
3,I get it. I get it ... stop hitting me over the head!,Great book on keeping your site clean and efficent. With countless tips on delievering a relevent site backed up by website reviews. The book itself is designed and laid out very well; it has a very nice feel and size to it. The problem I had with the book is after reading the first 100 pages or so I was hoping he would move on to a new topic. Much to my dismay 300 more pages of :this is not relevent ... less is more. Regardless the most through book on this topic.
3,"Middling writer, lousy prophet","For a book written in 1999, it's already an achievement that's it's not completely useless, but still it's a bit outdated. Most of its prophecies are wrong (email tokens, anyone? Browsers will be out of date?), and its advice is only good if, first, you believe in it, and second, if you have to manage a site the size of Microsoft.Even so, part of the book is rather useless. Intranet design does not say anytthing new, desining for disabilities misses many standards, and the part on writing for a global audience seems to be written for the kind of user usable web sites are addressed to, that is, not very bright, I guess. That makes half the book probably very usable, but not very useful.At the end of the day, if you look for advice for improving the design of your SOHO site, or your blog, you'll find next to nothing in this book."
3,U-G-L-Y and Dated,"I've had my copy since it was published in 1999. I pulled it off the shelf the other day to get into the Way Back Machine and, guess what? It really took me back--but not in a good way.The examples in the book, which was probably written in 1997-1998, are now almost 15 years old. There's not one web site in the book that I would even consider as something to emulate.Nielsen's book is good for design principles. Just don't consider using any of the included examples.A much better, more current book, is ""Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2e)"" by Steve Krug. Loaded with great examples and simple explanations, you'll find yourself intrigued."
3,"Good, but seriously needs a second edition","This book came out in 1999 and you have to be prepared for that. It's still about 80% useful, which is amazing considering how fast web technology is moving. I love the way the author uses lots of actual pictures of websites to illustrate every point. If he would bring it into the third millenium, I'd probably give it five stars instead of three."
2,Could be better,"The author offers critiques, but rarely offers a better idea or redesign. It's the same with his other book about home page usability. This is a severe shortcoming.A related problem is that some of his criticisms are just unfounded or - in my humble opinion - just plain wrong. And I'm coming to the conclusion that that's why he doesn't offer solutions - a web site is a tradeoff between competing goals. It's actually not that difficult to find ""problems"" with sites; it's much more difficult to fix those problems and find that sweet spot."
1,Virtually useless.,"The problem with a 'common sense' approach to usability is twofold:1)The design suggestions are solely the author's subjective opinions and have little empirical data to back them up.2)The suggestions that are well established enough to indeed be 'common sense' are common knowledge as well. It's not really news to anyone that a Web page should be visually simple, rather than visually complex.In short, if you have any background in the field at all, you'll mistrust many of the guidelines and already know the rest."
2,Over Priced and Overly Cautious,"A good, solid, GUIDEBOOK for anyone who is just starting out in wed design, but certainly not gospel. Seasoned professionals will appreciate it for what its worth: an enlighten collection of tips and opinions on the subject of web usability. It would have been nice if the book was more advice and here are your options/possible consequences, and less absolutism.I've been a fan of Nielsen's alert box for years and was excited at the prospect of this book. True it is nicely illustrated and full of good tips to keep in mind, but in general the Nielsen's advice is overly cautious times and down right extremist at others. Tighter editing would have cut back on the exhausting over analysis of some points as well as corrected the numerous other gramatical and typographical errors."
2,Design a Book I want to Read,"I wish the inside of this book lived up to it's cover, or title. What a let down! Try book design. A sea of text that falls into the gutter, leaving tons of white space unused off to the side. Ugly screen captures (albiet on point, if you are paying attention). Whatever it is about this book, the layout or the writting style (take your pick), I can't finish it. I've tried a few times, and with all these glowing reviews, I guess I'll try again. I DO agree that web usability is important. A good dose of bad medicine, I suppose. I'll hold my nose and keep reading (especially since I reeeaaaallly want to get my money's worth with this one). I still think it stinks."
5,"A brilliant, concise reference for Web designers","Dr. Nielsen's new book is a revelation. It offers wonderful insight into his experience dealing with the Web and is an invaluable reference for Web designers. His examples are relevant and his prose concise, making for an extremely easy reading experience. If you design Web sites or work in other areas of multimedia, this book is a must."
3,must-read for Managers & CEO's,"A VERY good book and highly recommended for Project Managers and even Sales Rep's and upper management, who will understand this book because it's simple and full of colorful screenshots. Not recommended for web designers, as they should have been reading the author's monthly column (and Tufte) for the past few years and this book is simply preaching to the choir. Don't know what i'm talking about? get the book."
1,Outdated and no news at all,You wont find anything in this book what general common sense already told you.Besides it's outoutdated and for this reason all examples are useless.
4,Simple Read,"I liked this book. I bought a template for my website.. so many of the design features talked about were already made for me. Good. But the accessibility guidelines were great. I added some finishing touches and I've got a pretty darn accessible site with a variety of browsers.My only failure was when you hit the homepage.. you should know immediately what the site offers.That I need some revisions at this point.Book was well worth the read. It might make some pages a bit borning, but you can skip those rules. Once you understand what makes a lot of pages really horrible, you can eliminate that stuff from your site and get moving.Animated gifs, scorlling marques, flashing text.. huge video files.. simple stuff like that really detracts from your site.All in all, this book was well worth the read. It went by really quick."
4,Kicks some serious Booty!,"This book kicks some serious booty! After having only read the first 100 pages of the book I'm starting to see what he's talking about when he discusses web usability and how it relates to sites that are developed today.I think this book is perfect for any web developer.However, the only bad thing I would have to mention about this book are the amount of pictures...which aren't bad...but I'd rather sacrifice the pictures with more content...that's just me.Anyways...the book rocks (so far) and is definently worth getting your mits on."
1,Nielsen is a dinosaur.,"The book is banned at our company. We feel is will stunt the creative growth of our employees. For the life of me, I can't understand how anyone who's been doing web work for a while would take Jakon Nielsen seriously. This man is *severely* out of touch with the industry, but mixes in just enough common sense for the sheep of the web design world to proclaim him an expert."
2,"Everyone's a Critic, Especially Nielsen","If you don't mind a book thta does nothing but criticize a technology and art that are evolving, then this is the book for you. No matter what the project, Mr. Nielsen can always do it better. I think he should correct the usability problems on his own Web site, before being declared king of Web usability.This book is way over-rated."
1,Designing Web Usability : The Practice of Simplicity,This guy has no imagination. If you are a WEB DESIGNER Jakob Nielson is the ANTICHRIST. If you read this book YOU have no imagination. I have a picture of Jakob on my wall. I throw darts at it. If I ever see this guy in public I would spit in his face.
1,Web Usability to the EXTREME!,"I just can't believe this guy is preaching web usability when his OWN web site ( useit.com ) is just a big long scrolling page of text and hyperlinks, with no navigation of any kind.Jakob Nielsen's idea of web design is similar to George Orwell's idea of 1984. Jakob would have us convert our HTML pages to a kind of ""HTMLspeak,"" where our creative design is consolidated to just one long scrolling page of text to appeal to a sort of technologically inept society."
2,Too much of nothing,"Nielsen's approach to teaching web design is ""learning by example"". The entire book is an endless series of screen dumps accompanied by Nielsen's comments about what is ""good"" and ""bad"" about the particular design. Unfortunately, most of the narration are only substantiated by ""proof by pronunciation by eminent authority"" (i.e. Nielsen himself). There is almost no reference to research, and very little resembling theory. There certainly is a lot of common sense expressed in the book, and an occasional tip and trick of to be utilised by a practising web designer may also from its pages of this book. But in its stated objective: to teach the student the fundamental principles of web site design, Nielsen's book fails miserably."
1,Lost my time reading it.,"Im a quite advenced web developer, i bought the book for discipline, you know, one have to read different opinions, but this was a bad time spending to buy it, espect it and reading it.Too much pre-self-appologies and redundant talking at the begining of the book, those 'predictions' about when will be possible to read long texts on line... completely out of place.Writing is disorganized, plenty of drifting away from the subject. I guess that Jakob Nielsen is a grat web developer, he knows many technical things about it, but he should not write books. Or he might take some lessons about ""making some text shorter"", -if you can say somthing using two words, don't use three. Usability is just about to make things easy to read and understand with minimum effort, this short-lettered, plenty-of-words-pages and plenty of pages book is exactly to learn things you should not do when trying to reach for usability.Im sorry Mr. Nielsen, its dissappointing."
3,Solid advice for a Web designer,"I pegged my hopes too high for ""Designing Web Usability."" I wanted to learn secrets that would take my websites to a new level. Instead, I read about the techniques and thought processes that I (think) I already infused into my web designs.This isn't bad news. That Neilsen confirmed my thinking was positive for me. I definitely picked up some tips, and did make a few changes to my sites as a result.Be aware that this book discusses the end result that Neilsen believes will maximize your web usability. He says he's planning a second volume to deal with the nuts and bolts of how to achieve the results."
2,Disappointed,"I was ready to love this book. Unfortunately, it's so conservative that I'm sending it back. Adhering strictly to these standards leaves little room for innovation. Some good lessons in common sense, but some points seem to go against good design sense. I know people who take the author's word as gospel, and, truly, I wanted to believe. For an alternative, try IDG's Great Web Architecture."
4,Excellent Baseline Reference,"Desigining Web Usability is, overall, an excellent book. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that if you are a seasoned Web designer/developer there is not a ton of information here that is new. But it is nice to have it all in one place and so lavishly presented. The production value of this book is very high and is itself an example of excellent information presentation (albeit in the print world).The book is especially good for those new to Web site design and usability. I have seen all too often how graphic designers or especially marketing types and executives new to the Web insist on designing a Web page THEY like instead of one usable for the intended audience.Overall you may not agree with everything Dr. Nielsen says but if you take the basic principles to heart your Web pages will be much better. A key principle is that just because a page looks good does not mean it functions well. Dr. Nielsen will show you how to do that."
4,"Good pricipals, but needs to be updated","The general ideas in the book are quite good, and should knows to all web developers, even if they choose to ignore them. The only problem I had with the book is that it was released in '99, and in some cases, it shows it's age. In today's environment, we usually don't need to worry as much about 56k modems, or 800x600 screens.The ideas of a fluid design and response time, however, are still quite valid."
4,From the Publisher,"Several customers have expressed concern over the lack of a fully-linked Table of Contents in the original Kindle edition of the Book of Discipline. We have corrected that oversight, and a few other formatting concerns in the revised edition available now. If you purchased a Kindle version of the Book of Discipline prior to mid-February 2010, please request a refund from Amazon and then purchase the eBook again to receive the updated Kindle version.We appreciate your interest in the Book of Discipline on Kindle.Myca AlfordDigital Publishing Manager"
1,Be careful if you order this,"The summary page of the Book of Discipline shows the current edition on the front cover, but when you click on it and go to the specific page you get a different edition. Be careful here. I was not and did not notice, so the book I got was the 1996 version instead of the current 2008 version. It was useless for what I wanted."
5,Snow on the roof but fire in the hearth,"An author who can hear the profound in the subtle risks being drowned out in the sonic boom of consumer culture. THE SAGE'S TAO TE CHING appears at first glance to be as weighty as a dandelion puff -- and those for whom futures trading is the anti-oxidant of middle age will likely scoff at the material valuelessness of this book. But in the genial wisdom of these chapters you will find a bouyancy born of a breadth of experience, of one who wears his age with wit and compassion.What separates a geezer from a sage? Read further, my child."
5,Delightful Wisdom,"Despite it's small size, this is a great book. There is something really refreshing, calming, comforting and energizing in it's shortpoetic texts about aging. I doubt I will become a sage reading it. But it is a book I return to and always put aside feeling relieved, weights having been miraculously lifted off my shoulders. Needless to say I love it!"
5,Words for a less discussed stage of life,"In our society we celebrate our youth and young adult lives, but resist recognition of aging as if it is a failure. We're fairly unimaginative. (The option of not experiencing old age is supremely limiting.) It's as if the fading of youthful skin is a signal to get out of the way and hide the hard won lines and wrinkles so as not to remind the youngers ones of their futures. We don't yet fully value the riches that are within the minds and hearts living in the aged.The Sages Tao Te Ching gently reveals how to look forward to and cherish age as much as we cherish childhood, youth and working adulthood. In fact, one can come away with the idea that the point of our whole life's journey is to have the luxury of becoming old.Imortant: while it helps to have a comfortable bed, possessions in old age become irrelevant to what really matters. What used to occupy us tends to fade away. The long view provides great joy."
4,The Sage's Tao Te Ching,"After reading this book I decided I wanted to become a sage and ""grow in trust and contentment"" rather than ""merely growing older...trapped by fears and frustrations."" This tiny book has compacted all the information one needs to become a sage. It follows the pattern of The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu and presents 81 poems, each explaining how one becomes a sage and what it means to be a sage. Mr Martin's prose resonated with me in a personal way. I would recommend his book to anyone now growing older, and isn't this just about everyone?"
4,"Not a book to take with you, but ...","... definitely a great one to start with. The Rough Guide to First-time Europe tells you all the things you need to know about travelling in Europe, before you get there and make the mistakes you don't want to. It has excellent ideas about packing, sample itineraries, and how to avoid cultural faux pas' in most places.It does have recommendations about what to see in various places, but it isn't necessarily a book to take with you, especially if backpacking!"
4,Great for planning first time..,"This is a great book... Gives you o many helpful hint an things to do from teh time you 'think' of a trip to Europe. Everything from what to wear, what to take an what not to take from how to start saving for the trip an money saving tips.i.e. I never realise that carrying a denim jeans would add weight as well as takes two days to wash and dry while you are on the move while simple cotton trousers would be more easy when you travel in the summer."
1,"Total Waste of Money, No Valuable Travel Information At All for Travel In Europe","This was the first Rough Guide travel book I have bought and definitely the last! Planning a trip to Europe I was expecting travel advice for when I am IN Europe. Instead the first 17 chapters wrote about everything so basic as to what a passport is, how to pack your backpack to what to do with your plants before leaving. Give me a break! The book was so common sense that unless you have never stepped a foot outside your country it is a complete waste of reading time. After 17 chapters of useless content the rest of the book gave a 2-3 page synopsis of each European country with zero valuable travel information.Luckily I bought Lonely Planet's Western Europe Travel Guide which is the size of a Bible with quality travel information. Again, this book is a total waste of money and offers absolutely no valuable travel advice for anyone traveling to Europe. Very disappointing!"
5,A Wonderful MP3 Player,"This is an excellent MP3 player. I walk with it almost every day, and it never skips. I'd buy it again."
3,"A Walker's Tool, gerat AM antenna for office use!","Here is what this device is to me. A great tool for walking and a great office AM radio! Its AM antenna is great and can be lined up to pick up weak signals in many offices. On walks it is really rain resistant!I have two of these. One was dropped HARD and the CD no longer works. The CDs can be the MP3 CD's you burn yourself. Not as convenient as the modern MP3 memory sticks, but a great unit because of the AM antenna! There is no MP3 track info display -- just the track number.The battery cover on both units is broken -- that is a design flaw, it breaks too easily. I use scotch tape to hold them in -- but on a two mile walk normal jostling will cause them to unseat. Typically two or three times I have to open up the unit and reseat the batteries.Still, I have had NO AM radio with an antenna as good as the SW967. The unit is worth it just for the AM reception!"
5,Super CD Player,This is one great cd player. This is the only one I have ever bought so can not compare it to others but I just can't imagine one any better.
2,Beecham Objected,"I have not heard this release of the recording, but potential purchasers should be aware that it is the soundtrack of the ballet version film of the opera. They should also be aware that when it was first released on LP 40-odd years ago, Beecham sued to try to stop it. He said it was performed for a specific purpose - - to accompany dancers - - and misrepresented how he would conduct it for a regular opera performance.The film is excellent, butI have heard the soundtrack recording and have to agree with Sir Thomas. It makes for strange listening. Folks looking for a good recording of the opera as an opera, not a ballet, should look elsewhere."
4,Devastating Rumors,"I must say my friends and i enjoyed reading this book. I liked the choice of words used throught out the entire book,as well as the formatting.The set up from chapter to chapter was also outstanding. It kept me wondering who,what,when,where and wanting to jump ahead of myself. It was like flirting with a real woman. What i mean is she did'nt expose herself on the first date. I kept coming back to see what the end was going to be.(smile)If this is the authors first book she has done an oustanding job i can't wait for the next one,two,three,four,five etc... you get the point.You Go Sister"
5,Cranking 'em out,"After about 2,000 copies, still cranking 'em out. No problems so far. We bought two at this price. Why waste your money on OEM."
2,wrong fit,I was in desperate need of a toner for our office copier. Since I work for a non profit food pantry I was hoping to find something less expensive than a the real replacement which is costly. I choose my model and it said it would fit. When it came I was excited because I figured I have just saved a bundle.. But to my surprise it did not fit. It looked like the one I was replacing but there was a little clip on the top left side that prevented it from slipping into place. The one I was replacing has the clip on the right side. So back in the box it went to return to Amazon for credit.
1,you get what you pay for.,This cartridge was priced so great!!! I had used a refurbished cartridge before and been happy. In this case I got about 350 copies and then it started streaking. Light says replace cartridge. I took it out and shook it... loose toner... I was in the middle of a huge work project and lost a lot of time switching to a small inkjet printer. You get what you pay for. If it's too good to be true? It is.
3,Toner cartridge longivity,"I was very happy that we were able to find low toner prices for our printer. I have bought remanufactured cartridges for many of our laser printers over the years. It has always been a gamble if the cartridge will be great, ok or have problems with it. I've had all of the above when ordering remanufactured cartidges. We ordered 3 L50 cartridges. The first one had a line at the edge after a very short time of use that transfered to our documents. The second one started putting black lines throughout our documents. We are using the third one now, so far so good. The first two we did not get very long usage out of them. I hope the third one will last longer."
2,Saved on money; lost on quality,"Saved A LOT of money on these cartridges (I bought two). But traded value for quality. One cartridge leaves a large gray band running length-wise on the right of every page. I haven't tried the second cartridge yet. (Review edited 8 months later): Just finished the second cartridge. It performed flawlessly. Out of two cartridges I received nearly 4,000 pages - about 2,000 a cartridge. The Canon L50 supposedly gets 5,000 pages. Even if these off brand cartridges print fewer pages, you're still saving money per copy."
5,Good dough hook,"I bought this to replace the old hook after it's rubber coating wore off. It is slightly different in shape from the original, but the wife says it's better so we're happy here."
2,chipped -- replacing part,"I'm replacing the original- on which the enamel chipped after 2 years light use. No metal or hard objects came in contact and I am very unhappy with the Kitchen Aid quality. However, this is the only choice now. It would be better if they made the dough hook from stainless steel.I have the Artisan stand mixer, but next time would purchase a different brand. This hook is difficult to remove from mixer head and no fun to clean."
2,Okay,"I love, love, love our Kitchenaid mixer, but I'm not thrilled with the quality of the dough hooks - I'm about to order our 3rd in less than 12 months. The enamel cracks on the end of the hook, and I'm afraid that using it risks chips of enamel ending up in the finished dough. Granted - they're only $15 to replace, but I don't feel like I should need to replace it so frequently... I'd happily pay quite a bit for a stainless steel one."
1,Quality has gone downhill,"The first dough hook I had from 20 years ago lasted like 15 years. The second one lasted 5 years. The third one lasted one month -- 3 uses, and it's shot. In each case, the plastic coating starting flaking off. Why, I might be feeding my family plastic! Ick! am now looking for a mixer with stainless steel hook."
4,works fine,"I have this dough hook and find it to be very helpful in making bread. I hardly do any hand kneeding because this takes care of it for me. I sometimes have trouble with it nicking the bowl, but that has more to do with the height setting in the mixer."
4,Great product except for the white paint that goes off,"A great hppk. I use it to knead the bread, and honestly it is a superior quality and strong, I make very rich bread, with dates, nuts, to it is very hard to knead it by hands, this hook is so strong it doesn't bend or break, my old one has been in the family for over 20 years now. So it is a solid product.I would however mention the painting on the hook, (white solid paint) sometimes it goes off it, and I am not sure whether it is a health hazard or not, but I remove the particles each time I see some.Overall, great product, I do recommend."
5,KitchenAid Dough Hook,I'd lost my dough hook and ordered this hook to replace it. It is exactly what I needed and fits like it came with my KitchenAid.
5,"If you hate kneading, but love homemade bread, you need this tool.",Dough hook worked great. The yeast dough was a good consistency and created an excellent loaf of bread. No need to knead by hand anymore!
2,Too short for my mixer,This attachment is way too short for my mixer. :( I'm quite disappointed. Cannot use it as it is several inches from the bottom of the bowl.
3,Kitchenaid dough hook attachment,This gift item was returned as we ultimately ended up purchasing a Kitchenaid model that came with the attachment.
5,"Tough subjects made very, very funny","I did stand-up comedy professionally for several years in the 90's. I love watching stand-up; some of my current favorites are Louis C.K., Doug Stanhope, Patton Oswalt and Jim Jefferies. I got this DVD the other day because, though I hadn't seen much of his stand-up, I always thought Norm was pretty amusing.Wow. I watched it five times in three days, and laughed heartily every time. It's a little slow to get going, but there are some real gems, and he hits some touchy subjects with a kind of goofy brilliance. It's the funniest stand-up special I've seen in awhile. Highly recommended."
4,Norm gets back to basics,"Norm gets back to what he does best in this special, which is minimalist dry comedy. I was somewhat worried that this would not be good given his last retail offering (""Ridiculous"") which was self-indulgent and truly terrible. I was pleasantly surprised by how funny this special was and I am glad the old Norm seems to be back."
5,Top Of His Game,I carry this standup on my Ipod and watch/listen to it every chance I can.It's like if a prospector came down from the mountain and made observations of the contrivances of our modern day lives. This said prospector is so confounded by our day-to-day colloquialisms his simple act of pointing them out is absolutely hilarious. Norm is the best.
5,brilliant,"absolutely brilliant hour or so of stand up.the ""waging a courageous battle"" bit and piece about Janice and serial killers are absolutely perfect.there's a reason other comedians love this guy. this dvd is it.also contains his bit at the Bob Saget roast which was absolute genius."
1,should be rated R for strong language,I gave it a shot because it was rated PG but within the first minute that was done. I didn't watch it for more than a couple of minutes. I liked him in the TV stuff he's been in but I'm not into the bad language.
2,Borning,Didn't gain a thing from this book. Boring stories. Not very useful advice. Disappointing since his other books were better. Perhaps he has run out of things to say.
4,Get your story straight,"Recommending Seth almost goes without saying.Quick paced, insightful read packed with anecdotes and good stories/examples of how a business'/product's story helps it to spread and be adopted by the public or clientèle.Get your story straight, believable, and easy to share. And check out this book."
3,Excellent first half!,"The first half of the book was excellent - packed with insights. However, towards the end, the author was looking for ""stories"" to beef up the book. These tended to be uncordinated!Overall however, it was an interesting read."
5,Just Excellent!,Nothing bad to say! Came on time and in perfect conditions! Packed and new Brand book! Just the same in the description!
2,Repetitive.Poorly organized. Fluffy.,"This book would have made a nice HBR article, if condensed into 15 pages. Alas, I had to force myself keep reading after the first chapter (which I read in the bookstore, and which made me buy the book in the first place)As many others have noted, the book is overly repetitive, poorly organized and generally has too much fluff in it, portraying a simple concept as a sacred marketing elixir... 4 points for the first chapter, minus 2 points for the rest of the book."
3,Not nearly as good as his newer stuff,"I love Seth Godin's work, read his blog daily, etc. I thought that I would spend some time reading his older books, since everything he does is gold, but I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as his newer works."
2,"Some interesting concepts and facts, but there's gonna be more to the story","Some interesting and eye-opening concepts, and a relatively easy read. However, the premise of telling 'stories,' which are essentially lies wrapped in 'authenticity' is exceedingly flawed. The true story is always the best and eternally effective, even if it doesn't drive short (or even long) term profits. Marketers have a responsibility to tell the truth, albeit in the form of a story or whatever language will reach the consumer. If your truth sucks, then reinvent your product/service, don't tell a lie and expect your authenticity to make it true...that's the essence of bullshit."
4,Marketing for our Attention-Deficit World,"A marketing book for our attention-deficit age. It's short, entertaining and gives you a lesson in marketing. This is not the first time I've heard this marketing strategy, but it is particularly pertinent for internet marketers. Given the consumer's suspicion that almost anyone could be on the other side of the computer, you've got to give people more than just a list of features and benefits. There's got to be a connection - a sharing of worldview, as Godin calls it. The story that every successful marketer has to tell is ""I'm just like you, but maybe a bit more interesting."""
5,Excellent read.,Seth Godin writes the books I wish my marketing classes would use. They are an excellent resource for heading into a large purchase and dealing with sales people. Also great for marketing yourself.
4,Helpful for new Marketers and Veterans Needing a New Approach,"With this title, Seth Godin displays his marketing advice to use unique approaches to marketing that will gain consumers attention. He doesn't really believe all marketers are liars. His goal is to teach you how to talk about your products with true stories that buyers will relate to, stories that prove your products will satisfy their wants. He explains what a story is and why stories are important for an effective marketing campaign.People enjoy and remember stories but a marketing story MUST be true or you will soon lose credibility about your products.The author also tells what to do so `word-of-mouth', the ideal marketing tool, will begin and spread news about your products to consumers,.He also lists other helpful books.An interesting and worthwhile volume for new marketers and veterans needing a new approach."
4,Always good to get a new perspective,Mr. Godin does a good job of logically explaining why people make decisions. He also gives hints on how to tell stories in a way that appeals to your audience. I think it's good advice and i am going to try to put it into practice.
5,Worldview accomplished,"As the the author anticipated in the book, this book has created for me a new worldview on marketing."
5,fulfilling my expectation,"I'm happy about the book. The story it's telling adheres perfectly to the ""new rules"" people are setting up for the marketing of the new millenium: lovemarks by kevin roberts for example or the whole web 2.0 philosophy.The book is clearly written even if it uses a lot of examples from the US World, not always known to people outside US (e.g. products, presidents, ...). I would have liked a little introduction to non-elected presidents I dont't know anything about. Except from this the book is great and worth the money."
4,Modern day Hans Christian Anderson approach for grown ups.,"Marketing is all about winning trust and involves a piece of make believe. It's in the eye of the beholder. Seth boils marketing down to simple steps (in all of his books), and making it simple is needed in this complex world. Stories have been around for ages and they have a great impact as it allows for complex problem being told in simple terms. Seth gives many great examples in this book and is put some meat around the what and how, and keeps impressing with his easy readable books. Helpes to take difficult messaging and transform it into easy understandable stories. Its a look in the kitchen of the modern day Hans Christian Anderson, whom stories have been around for ages, but his messages still hold strong. Marketer are not liar (his title is his first lye:-), but definitely a catching title and worthwhile reading."
5,Great book about telling authentic stories as a marketer,"All Marketers Are Liars shows the power of telling authentic stories. He doesn't argue that marketers are liars, but that they are story tellers who tell stories that consumers choose to believe. Something Nike has been doing for some time. Seth Godin has a blog sepecifcally linked to the book at [...]. A must read for all in marketing."
3,Author makes a valid point ...but there are better books on the subject,"In this book, Seth Godin discusses the practice of telling compelling, attention grabbing stories about a product and gives examples of products that use this approach and shows that this practice is a compelling ways to market a product. The story that is told is the ""lie"" that he references in his title most.Telling stories about a product is a fairly common and accepted practice in most marketing department nowadays. If the idea that telling stories is new to you, than you might find this book an interesting read because throughout the book Godin gives examples of well known brands and their stories.If you are a marketing professional, you will probably find that this book is a bit fluffy and had little new information in it. For a better book on telling stories, I would recommend The Secrets of Word of Mouth Marketing by George Silverman"
1,Captivating title but......,"OK, I will start by saying I am always skeptical of business books because I always feel like they are telling us something we already know. AND EVEN if it is something I don't already know, is it necessary to have a 208-page book essentially saying the same thing over and over again? The book is chock full of anecdotes, but all point to the same conclusion: the product must tell a good STORY. And to be honest, I am not so sure I buy into the use of the word ""story"". But, in any case, the author beats it to death. This book could have easily been summarized in a 2-3 page pamphlet. I noticed one reviewer included some quotes, most of which came within a 20 page span. As a book of stories, it works OK, but I think I would prefer a book like ""The Tipping Point"" before this one."
3,A Matter of Perspective,"If you read Seth Godin's books for the exercise in innovation, you may be disappointed in this book. But if you read this book to understand positioning, you will likely find it beneficial. Different perspectives, different results - that's the gist of this book. Marketers are tasked with projecting products in a positive and differentiating light. Godin asserts that whether consumers buy these stories is a matter of: 1) alignment with reality and 2) the consumer's perspective. The problem is that marketers often try to control the latter. The book doesn't really address this facet; in fact, some examples tout exagerations as successes (ex. a brand of glasses that improves a wine's taste). Godin asserts that marketers aren't really liars but, again, that's a matter of perspective."
2,Not what I expected,"You get for what you pay...The lens is not sharp at all, even at higher F values. To closer you get to 2.8 the most you notice vignetting in the four corners of the photo and I judge this based on the fact I use a full frame camera, might not be the same with a 1/2 frame. The lens petal hood would not align perfectly (at least on my model) and I think this is a problem because it is noticeable on my pics. I love the material and the feel of the lens but I just couldn't use it for the type of photography I do."
1,Consistantly backfocuses,"I've had this lens for several years now, and I've found that it backfocuses if it is wide open. I can use the camera at small aperatures, but I paid a lot of money to be able to shoot wide open. Money down the drain."
1,Sigma 28-70mm f/2.8,"I like the lens and the picture quality but its not an automatic focus lens. To me it's more of a pain in the @ss to try to get every single photo in focus and when I need to shoot action shots it's terrible because of the manual focus. When I bought it I thought it was autofocus. I am currently using this lens on a nikon D3100.On a good note, the lens has great boke and if you focus the subject correctly it's an ok lens. Just wished the description had said something that it doesn't have an autofocus motor built in. Well enough ranting for now, this is just my opinion anyways. Good luck"
1,Carring Case is so big to hold the ES8200V camcorder,"Guy,I do not recomend to purchase this product with the ES8200v because is too big to secure the camcorder. I expected to fit exactly to ensure that the camera is not going to move inside the case. This model of case is designed more for a VHS camcorder."
5,NOT AS PICTURED...,The Canon Camcorder Soft Carrying Case I received was much smaller and so unbelievably compatable with my Canon DC210 Camcorder. Compact and easy but snug fit that will allow to be zipped up and protected from the elements. I love it!!
4,"lovely, lyrical, sentimental, local Chicago favorite!","Wow, what great news to see Bonnie Koloc is still around. A favorite singer from Chicago. Her lyrics are unique to her style. There's nothing boring here! She belts out a song with a bluesy style and a folksinger's grace. The band that plays with her is also quite unique and good. Don't expect to dance to Bonnie Koloc's music. Just sit back and listen and enjoy!"
3,Buy it now. You might not find it again.,"You never know when a record company will no longer make a cd. I have not purchased cd's only to regret not being able to purchase them at all or at exorbitant prices.The songs ""With You On My Side"", ""There's A Space In the Place Where You Were"" and ""I Believe In You"" are my favorites. ""Gun For The Game"" is fun on occasion. ""If My Love Were A River"" and ""You Played Me Like A Piano"" are enjoyable enough. I love Bonnie Koloc. Her most cohesive cd to date is ""Here To Sing"" but ""With You By My Side"" is a good find."
4,Perfect match,This was exactly what I needed to help extend my wifi signal. I use this with an external wifi card for my laptop.
4,Works Well,"I used a couple of these to connect external antennas to a router for a wifi hotspot.I had one break on me, the N-jack twisted off but its easy to slide back on, and this was because i was twisting it too much unnecessarily.So they're not impervious: be careful not to twist or bend it too much.Otherwise works as advertised and I am satisfied with the 3 that I bought."
5,Great Cable,Bought two of these one for myself and the other for a friend. You're looking at a very good cable that offers very little signal loss. It' s worth the money.
4,Good working cable,"Good cable.It does the job.6ft wired cable. If you need to use a cable long then 6f,one this will be to short."
4,Good distance/clarity,"I used this to wire an unidirectional antenna outside my house, and it has given me good readings for up to about 500ft. I know that it is rated at about 1/2 mile, but I have no use for it further. Easy installation and good connectors included."
5,Well made.,It's a cable. It works. Not much else to say. It appears well made and the connections are solid. Can't go wrong.
4,Its a cable it works...,"Works, seems well made. Don't know how it will hold up outside for years but don't see any reason why it won't."
3,Very good low loss antenna cable,"This cable is great for connecting a better antenna with a N female connector (cable is Male) to your SMA device such as a usb wifi with a removable antenna or router/access point. Worked great indoors and out. Let's see how it holds up to adverse climate conditions.EDIT. I was making some connection changes so I temporaly uninstalled the cable.I put the protective plastic covers while not in use.When I tried to take the protective cover of the N male connector for the second time, the connector came of instead of the plastic cover. I didn't use much force and It didn't look like it was intended to do this. I was able to insert it back again and the cable still worked but left me wondering if this will affect my routers performance. Knocking 2 points because of this. If this is suppose to happen please let me know so I can edit my review once more.Regards,Ernie"
5,wireless bridging two buildings through brick,"We used two 15 dBi Pole-Mount Yagis and a pair ASUS RT-N12 hooked them up with a pair of TRENDnet TEW-L202 cables to connect two buildings about half a block a part together. Oh... there's a two story brick building in the way that completely blocks the line of sight. In the other location, we're getting 25-30% of the download speed, 15-20% of the upload speed and the same latency as the location with cable internet. One caution: make sure you update the ASUS NT-N12 units to the latest non-beta firmware (released in the middle of the year). The firmware of the units we received from Amazon had bugs that kept the unit in the other building from self-configuring as a repeater."
1,A map of los angeles that only shows one freeway?,"I was shocked when I opened this map of Los Angeles, and finally realized the value of browsing bricks and mortar bookstores before buying online. This map covers such a small percentage of LA that on the full scale map of this city of freeways there is only one freeway showing. It has no Santa Monica or ocean. It omits USC and LA City College, and cuts halfway through UCLA. It has no continuity, showing parts of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood and Hollywood, but not how they connect to Downtown (only part of which is included in a detail), ignoring the three miles in between. It skips entirely the happening neighborhoods of Silverlake and Los Feliz. If tourists were to rely on this map to get between two points they would probably fall off the map before reaching their destination."
3,"Nice, but...","This is a nice design, but as other reviewers have stated, it is extremely flimsy. In fact, it is paper thin. I was expecting it to have a little more heft to it. Also, the pop rivets used to hold it together are overly large and detract from the appearance.So, great design, but poor execution."
3,Looks good.,Followed directions and waxed the spinner to protect the finish and only time will tell. Here in Oregon the weather does take it's toll on outdoor speciality items so ask me in 6 months if the wax helped protect the finish..We did attach a green ball with copper wire to add weight as recomended by another owner and that helps keep it stable in a breeze.
2,nope,"sorry, i'm not hard to please. this spinner don't spin unless it is really windy. also after only a month of mild weather, it is also rusting. not happy overall. it was not really cheap either."
5,Very pretty,"First purchased a spinner on our vacation this year, that got me started looking for other designs on Amazon, I purchased this one & am very pleased with it. It catches the light beautifully on our battery operated spinner motors. Extremely quick shipping & great service. Thank you!!"
4,Butterfly Spinner,I bought this as a decoration for my mother's garden. She and her neighbors enjoy watching it spin lazily on hot days or crazily on windy ones.
3,Garment bag,Price was excellent for the value. Shipping was high. Item was shipped promptly and arrival condition was excellent. Will work perfectly for the longer woman's items.
4,Great,"Use these for the college students back and forth.They're easy to work with, light weight, and take up little space to store."
3,Great for the price,"For what it is and what it costs, it's great! I don't travel much for work, so this should get my by until I'm on the road more. If you are a frequent traveler, though, I could see this not being the best solution. It's a great garment bag, but with heavy use I could see problems. Still a great purchase for the infrequent business traveler!"
5,Excellent value,"Has held up well over first two months of use. Material is light and strong, design efficient. I travel a lot with multiple garments, and this is the best lightweight bag I have ever had."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This bag is absolutely as cheap as you would expect for the price. The fabric and zipper are clearly cheap, but if you just need a garment bag for light products and minimal use, I suppose this could work for you. However, I used this while traveling by plane, and it broke halfway through my trip, which was a huge pain for a someone traveling on their own, and it was rather difficult to carry."
4,It's a bag,"There really isn't much to say about this bag. It's being used to store a Santa Claus costume. It's poly and has a zipper. The zipper doesn't really engage all that well, but let's be honest, it's a $9 bag so I didn't really expect much different. Overall it actually feels better made than I really had hoped for for the money."
3,Simple Suit Bag,"I bought this bag because I need one on the fly and I knew Amazon could deliver. However, after traveling and seeing other bags I have noticed how much better other bags are. This bags meets the basic needs, but misses the mark on nice perks. So, if you don't do much traveling and just need a simple bag have at it. If you travel frequently, then look else ware, since you can find other products that better meet your needs."
1,you get what you pay for,"Not a lot to be excited about with this bag except the low price - oops! The material is very thin, the side zipper is awkwardly placed, making it difficult to get clothes in, the hanger tie at the top needs its own instruction manual (I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do with it!), and the stitches on the name-tag slot have started to come out after the first use. Yeah, not a lot to get excited about."
4,Travel Garment Bag for Dresses,"This garment bag is deceiving. We were able to get two medium length coats into this bag without causing it to burst at the seams! They fit just fine. But it's either or... either dresses or coats or two dresses and one coat. Of course, it all depends on your garment combination as to what will actually fit into it. Watch your hanger types as well, the wooden type can reduce how many garments you actually get into the bag. Only time will tell of it's actual durability. All-n-all, it turned out to be a pretty descent buy.Y4E4SHUA@yahoo.com"
3,useable,"It is cheaper quality than I expected , but not bad for the price. Was a very smooth transaction. If it was made with thicker heavey duty material I would have given it 5 stars."
1,piece of garbage,"dont get me wrong the people were nice when i wrote to them buttttttttttttttt.. like someone else said it doesnt close to take on a trip,, so thin only holds a few things and the bag is so flimsey, i saw the same thing at the dollar tree for 1.00.. not worth sending it back to them it would cost as much as the postage.. i wouldnt recommed this for travel at all.. if u want to store something in your closet your better off using a large garbage bad.. very unsatisfied with this product needless to say"
1,Typical cheap product made in China,"When I received it I thought it looked pretty good. I put three shirts and two pants in the garment bag and hung it in my closet. This morning I removed one of the shirts and went to church. After I came home I changed clothes and went to put the shirt back in the garment bag I noticed that one of the seams had a gap in it. When it was sewn up the cheaply paid Chinese sewing machine operator missed putting the bag ends far enough into the binding, and so the thing is coming apart.The dang thing isn't worth paying shipping to return it. I'll probably just sew it up by hand, but it's too bad I've got to fix something that I just purchased.Oh, how I miss the good old days when I could go to the store and buy something made in America."
1,Terrible,I wish I would have read the previous review before buying it. All I needed was some general information (structure etc.) on how iostreams work and this book did little for me. I do not recommend it to anyone
4,"Gentle, touching, remarkable","As the story opens, we meet Rudi and Trudi, an older couple living in Bavaria. Rudy is stoic and undemonstrative, content to go to his dull job everyday while Trudi harbors a secret wish to see Japan, yet they are as close as two cabbage rolls on a plate. When she learns that he is dying, she arranges a trip to visit their children, but the kids are too busy to be bothered with them.This is a remarkable film about life and death and devotion. It moves slowly and gently and allows us to get to know the couple and their self-absorbed children. It deals with love and fulfilling one's dream and gave me a lot to think about. The story goes from Germany to Japan and is in German with English subtitles and much spoken English in the second half.The DVD cover calls this movie, ""sublime,"" and I agree. If you've experienced love and loss, this movie will touch you deeply. Highly recommended."
5,cherry blossoms,"cherry blossoms has become my all-time favorite movie, and I see a lot. The camera crew caught sensitive light and color movement that makes the film sparkle, it would be breathtaking on a larger screen.the story line, what we think we know about each other and what is really going on, is as old as time but very freshly approached here. I have loaned it to everyone I know. This is a love story.I was able to get this video through amazon before I could find it anywhere locally, thank you"
4,Wonderfull book,"I like to read book and when I read this book, I learned many thing about astronomy, and I found this book very helpfull and easy to understand."
5,wonderful stories.,They don't make literature like this anymore...a must-read for children. (Just be careful who you buy it from...they misled me on the condition.)
5,Dye Sticky 3's,"I have 8 years of paintball experience and I've owned dozens of guns, all with different grips (aftermarket & stock). Without a doubt in my mind the Sticky 3's are the best grips that money can buy for any gun. They fit solidly and comfortably in your hand and over time begin to mold to your grip."
3,"If you're recording music, this is the wrong Mic","Took me a while to figure this out but all of the built in camcorder mics and ""general purpose"" accessory mics (like this one) have a built in high pass filter which reduces recording of the lower frequency sounds to help remove the mechanical tape and zoom sounds from the recording. Live music recordings will never sound right no matter which of the three setting you use because the low end is cut back on all of them. I finally bought the Rode Stereo Vidmic, which allows switching that filter off when you really want a balanced frequency response, and found that my HV20 is really quite capable of recording excellent music audio. Something that it could not do with the DM50."
3,"Directional Mic- not bad, convenient","I bought this mic a year ago for an older Canon camcorder (which has since failed.) When I replaced my camcorder, I bought the Canon HV20 because it has a hotshoe. The sound difference when recording with the mic (I'm generally recording classical music during concerts from the audience) is noticeable. The mic is small and light, easy to install. When I researched camcorders to buy a new one, I discovered that there are better directional mics on the market, but they are more expensive. I may eventually upgrade, but for now this will do."
4,Canon Directional Sterio Mic,"Canon Directional Stereo Mic (DM 50) for Camcorders with the Advanced Access ShoeMy Canon FX 70 camcorder has an excellent audio recorder but it is limited to omnidirectional recording. Background noise can distract from my desired recording. My new Directional Serrio Mic (DM-50) gives me three options, front, side& front & onmidirectional. I find the #2 side & front selection the best for interviewing or focusing on a selected group. Voices are clear & sharp with reduced background noise."
1,Upsetting...,"Not seeing many reviews, I'm writing this as a warning. This mic is horrible. I bought it to get rid of the ""motor noise"" from my Canon Optura Pi, as many others have. When I listen now, the sound is much worse. You can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... THIS MIC IS HORRIBLE!"
2,For Advanced Access Shoe Only,"I'm writing this just in case some one makes the same dumb mistake i did. I typed in the search field for Canon 7D Microphone and this product came up. I read all the reviews and bought the item. i can confirm the build of the item is sturdier then ones i have actually seen and felt. however, i didn't realize that this item is for Canon's camcorders that have the ""Advanced Access Shoe"" only. Which my camera does not. I know i know.... i should of known better."
4,Nice Shotgun Mic for the money.,"Nothing worse then dropping a chunk of coin for a high dollar 1080i camera and the sound is crap... (see Canon HG10). The DM-50 in the hot shoe cured that woe and nicely I might add. I use the #2 setting (Stereo forward).. #1 is Mono forward and #3 is stereo wide 180 degrees.The sound quality of my live music recordings is important to me and the camera mic alone left me with tinny sounding flat audio. This mic adds clarity and bottom end. Warning this sucker is driven off the camera's battery.... BUY a bigger battery, but 2 just in case."
2,Good microphone if don't touch the camera during filming.,"This is a capable microphone that comes with a major caveat. Since the microphone slots directly into the hotshoe of the HV20/30, there's not much in the way of buffer to divorce it from any camera noise. I'm not just talking motor noise: any time you press a button on the camera to toggle settings, anytime you use the manual focus slider, anytime you shake the camera in the slightest...the mic picks up the noise. The makes for an absolute audio nightmare.So - if you plan to plop the camera on a tripod and not touch it whatsoever during filming, this microphone is a fine choice. If you plan to use a tripod but want to do something as simple as zoom in on your subject, be aware that you are likely to end up with some unwelcome clicks and pops when you watch your footage."
1,Not compatable with Canon HG20!,"This mic would probably be great if it worked with all cameras with the accessory shoe (as advertised), but it doesn't. I have the Canon VIXIA HG20 and this mic does not fit in the accessory shoe slot at all, making it useless to me. I'll be returning this and try out the DM-100. Hopefully that will work."
4,Good for this type of Mic,"This is about as good as this type of mic gets. Slides in easily, good as a shotgun. The stereo is a little less functional."
4,Canon Directional Mic,One feature it doesn't have is an off switch which would then activate the camera's built-in mic. Sony has this feature.
4,Canon cam mike,only used it once so far for a live music event at a bar and it seems to have worked just fine so far as I can tell.
3,just fine,"Although this is much less expensive than the Norton Anthologies, you can see where Norton spends the extra money. This is a very bare bones anthology with little in the way of critical superstructure (besides Parini's very good introduction."
5,Great book!,My son loves turtles....we have 7 of them. He read this book cover to cover. Excellent book for turtle lovers.
1,Worthless Piece of Trash,A friend bought one of these and used in on my computer for a presentation. It worked...once...and that was it. I bought the same thing and mine didn't work at all. This thing is a worthless piece of garbage and I regret ever buying it. Buy one from another company. This is par for the course for Microsoft.
1,Something is wrong with it,"It worked when I tested, after this it the only thing that continues working was the laser pointer. I tried to use it with different computers and it did not work either. The main problem is that Microsoft does not provide any help to troubleshoot it.I was looking for help in the net and the only thing I found were hundreds of users with the same problem but no solution."
1,Frustrated,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!This product worked once, when I initially installed it. Before I could actually deliver the presentation, it stopped working and has not worked since. Have not been able to get it to work using any of the ideas on the discussion board. I regret not having researched it before making the purchase. I now see that many, many people have had similar experiences. Obviously microsoft knows of the problem. They just lost me as a customer, not only for this, but for anything branded microsoft that I can avoid."
1,Microsoft quality?,"I bought this presenter to use while teaching. It never worked from the first moment I got it. The accompanying instructions gave no hint as to what to do, other than the old Microsoft - reinstall and reboot both the sending and receiving units. That didn't work. Sent it back to the supplier and never heard from them again, let alone a refund.Went to the store, bought a Kensington combination mouse and presenter, and it worki9ed instantly I plugged it in. Didn't have to do a thing. It is excellent.Don't buy the Microsoft presenter. I looked all over the nte AFTER buying it, and found nothing but bad reviews and discussions about quality issues."
1,A dog!,"When it works, it's fine. The problem is getting it to work. After my first two presentations, it failed, and nothing I do will get it to work - other than the laser pointer. Try to find any support for it on the Microsoft web site. There are numerous complaints all over the Internet identical to mine."
1,Should've known better...,"0 Stars. Purchased this item in the morning, returned it the same afternoon. Only the laser pointer worked. When I saw it was a Microsoft product I hesitated before purchasing it, but since it was the only one carried at the store I went ahead and decided to give it a try. ""Best for Power Point"" it claims. If your Power Point presentation has only one slide, maybe it will work for you. Otherwise, pass. I should've known better..."
2,"50 inches, not 50 feet","This presenter seems to need to stay in ""line-of-sight"" of its reciever, and even then, it will transmit reliablly from only about 5 feet, and not at all from past 10 feet. So in order to get reliability during presentations, it may be best to carry a USB extention cable to bring the reciever away from the computer and closer to you. Arguablly, this defeats the whole purpose of ""wireless."" I've tried this presenter on multiple comptuers with multiple sets of batteries.... It just doesn't have very good range.On the plus side, it does have a nice laser pointer, and the timer (complete with a customizable ""warning buzz"") is quite nifty, although it only displays minutes, not seconds. Only problem is a serious lack of range in situations where the computer station is in the corner of the room. Which, in most situations, is where your comptuer will be."
1,Unreliable and breaks,"I purchased several of these presenters to use at our agency. I made my decision primarily based on the reputation of Microsoft. When I first received the product, I was pleased. It has a good weight, feels like a quality product and is easy to use. HOWEVER, after only a few uses we found the USB component to be a total waste of money. It breaks easily and then the presenter will not communicate with the PC. We basically have 4 over-priced laser pointers because the USB portion of the devices broke. I must add that the equipment wasn't abused or mishandled. The USB portion is just fragile."
1,Extremely Incosistent...poor performance,"I've messed around with this product for about 4 hours and have wanted to throw it against the wall multiple times.The mouse function is not smooth...that's if it is even working.The functionality during a powerpoint presentation is very hit or miss. I plan on doing many laptop presentations and feel extremely un-confident in utilizing this product for fear of experiencing embarassing technical difficulties.I plan on trying other wireless products, hopefully with better results...apparently I can't even return this opened product. Ugh.-Dissatisfied customer."
3,Unique.,Condition not the best but book subject has proved to be quite interesting. Would not be everyone's cup of tea.
1,How was this published?,"I read this book and was amazed by the contents.The Pocket Guide to Celtic Spirituality might function as a wonderful introduction to Neopaganism. However, the problem is that the author attributes exclusively Neopagan beliefs and rituals to the ancient Celts. Such obviously incorrect assertions as the statement that ancient Celtic priestesses were known as Naiads (Greek water nymphs) and that the Morrigan was a ""sea goddess of wisdom and beauty"" (virtually all other sources state she was a goddess of war) make me wonder if the author simply didn't bother to do any research at all, or is just indulging in wishful thinking. This book makes no distinction between facts and religious dogma, and anyone seeking a historical account of the mythology of the ancient Celts should not buy it."
4,Swing that Swung,"I liked the CD, it had plenty of songs and the music was great. If you are looking for Dance mixes this is probably not for you but if you like the old music I think it was well worth the money."
2,Can I sell this on E-Bay??,"I have never left a comment on a site like this before, but thought my experience was worth it. I usually choose the biggest and most complete guidebooks for everything. In this case, I was completely disappointed. Though this reference might be useful if I were a visual basic programmer, I feel that I spent extra money on a book which I can use only half of. Also, I felt like the author was skipping steps he thought I should know how to do. I had trouble duplicating what was explained. This book might well be great for people who know Visual Basic?? I am computer literate and by no means consider myself a beginner at any software really, but this book made me feel like I was in a league several notches to high. Good luck developers, I wish I could sell my copy on E-Bay!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this movie (cheap) because I like Keitel and period movies, but I was disappointed. The scenery was pretty, but the movie was not enjoyable. The music was the only thing that gave the film any feeling of suspense. I will not watch it again."
5,SurJackBastard and his first opinion.,"Having been involed in the lifstyle for some 5 years this makes for interesting reading. Yeah we know it's fiction with a twist of fantacy, but it does have a fair level of the correct mindset needed by those that are portrayed. The contents of this book will challenge some, placate others and generally entertain most. Laura? well done great job and a great writing style, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.SJB"
1,Great idea but....,"Great characters and such, unfortunately this book fell short of my expectations. Why? The lack of an editor. I know small presses have a hard time getting things edited, but for crying out loud, all of the blatant spelling and grammatical errors distract from the message of the book. I haven't picked up any of the others because the first was so disappointing. Ms. Antoniou, get a decent editor!"
2,Marketplace review,"This was the worst in the books from this author. If you like descriptive scenes, this is not for you.Pretty well written but the story has no interest and there does not seem to be any point in it.Skip this one."
4,A good start to a great series,"Unlike some standard erotic fiction these books by Laura Antoniou have plots, humor and good character development with interesting characters. If you expect straight vanilla erotic reading you will be disappointed, if you are looking for a story as good as you will find in ""mainstream"" literature you will not be disappointed. Very well crafted story of one slave who is stuck in one role that she does perfectly and three wannabes who are really unpromising. This introduces Chris who is a central character in the series as well as two other trainers who own the training house and also appear off and on in the series. I wanted to give a 3.5 star rating because of some disappointing proofing but decided that I should in all fairness round up not down."
2,I have never seen this many grammar errors in one book.,"I love S&M. Unfortunately, the grammar errors in this book make it almost impossible to read. The continued mistakes, like the use of the word ""then"" every time the author means ""than,"" are extremely distracting. I often had to read sentences more than once to figure out what the author was trying to say. Ms. Antoniou needs an editor."
4,well worth the money,"Nice program for the price! Before buying this product I downloaded a trial copy of Turbocad2D and found it very difficult to get it to perform as I wanted. Not the case with QuickCAD. The multi-snap function makes this a breeze quickly bring any drawing to life. Don't be fooled by the experience levels control, it just turns off certain buttons for beginners and then on again for experts. Go ahead and use the expert level (you have to anyway to get through the ""getting started guide"" that comes with the software). The manual that also comes with the software is extremely informative and must be referred to several times until you learn all the tricks and hot keys. Once again, I feel this is a GREAT program for the price!"
4,Not bad....,I've been using Generic cadd for years for furniture and project designs and recently purchased this program when I upgraded my computer. I found it easy to learn and enjoy it more than I thought I would. It is much easier to dimension a drawing or change elements than in GC. The 3 levels is just hype; all it does is shut off tools that even the most elementary of drawings is going utilize.
5,Absolute best for the price,"I bought the early version of Quick CAD 3.02 in 1995 for $99.00 and have used it ever since. I have designed chemical plants, inventions and now I am designing houses. It does have some limitations but for 2D layout it is very easy to use and final drawings in large format are very professional looking. I am now buying the newer version."
2,You get what you pay for,"For the price, this is a good little program. I used it for small project layout designs. They are fairly professional looking but the program has many limitations. Layering and layering with colors seems to be a major problem. The manual was next to worthless, but if you want to toy around and dont want ot spend money on something like AutoCad, then this is a fine program - just dont expect to be designing the space shuttle on it."
3,"Great, great book, disappointing edition","Preparing to move abroad where Henry Miller is still banned, I thought I could save on shipping and some shelf space by purchasing the three volumes of ""The Rosy Crucifixion"" printed in this single edition. Unfortunately, the book is awkwardly over-sized and looks like a textbook. A cursory perusal found several typos. I ended up giving it away and shipping the separate volumes instead."
4,Fonts are a little small,"I don't even know if all three books were combined together before. The text quality from this publisher seems to be in decent shape, but Miller's second trilogy was over a million words, and things are a bit... scrunched.Might be a good deal for a college student, but my eyes aren't quite what they used to be. The ebook helps a lot, 'cause you can enlarge the text on screen.Otherwise, it's a chronicle of Henry Miller's final days in NY before he began his legendary trip to Paris, and that last goodbye, written when the author was past 60 still sings to me as perhaps no other scribe canThree stars for the little letters; five for the books themselves."
2,Boring...,"I like Ugly Duckling's earlier music, although all their tracks have the same flaw. They all sound the same! The lyrics are just too rambling. If you skip to the middle of each song you can hardly even tell it's a different track. They dont even really rap, it's more like talking over a beat.Track 3 ""The Breakdown"" starts strong, the beat starts up at 0:10 and you're like wow this is going to be hot! Then at 0:19 that beat fades out and some other garbage starts... It's reused again at the chorus but the whole song just doesnt gel, it's like two different beats moulded as one. It's almost as if they had a pile of acapellas laying around they needed to find beats for and just slap it together and shipped it...Anyway if you're new to the underground scene, avoid this. Check out some of their earlier stuff first at least... UD, get a better producer and try changing up the flow a bit more."
2,The business crowd must be running out of heroes,This is terrible! This book lacks even the most rudimentary Alexander scholarship and accepts many of the stories of the Alexander Romance without question. The lessons extracted may be fine but many do not truly come from Alexander the Great. I guess the basic assumption here is that nobody knowing anything about Alexander in depth will even read this volume. This is another in a recent rash of noncritical Alexander worshipping books. Please read some of the great books and literature on Alexander the Great to get a balanced picture.
2,Contrived.,"I could recommend this book only to a 9th or 10th grader who needed to complete a biographical sketch of Alexander. As for the book's premise, namely that one can study Alexander and derive lessons applicable to today's business world, this is as contrived an idea as I've seen in recent years. For example, we learn that Alexander routed his opponent, Darius, at Gaugamela. The defeat was complete. Therefore, claims the author, we can draw from this incident the conclusion that sometimes ""deconstruction is the only way to begin a merger."" Having lived through numerous mergers and acquisitions, I can only be grateful that personnel decisions were made based on economics and productivity, and not on some irrelevant analogy to war."
2,it flakes,Not the quality of the name brand. The painted coating almost immediately started to flake off.
4,Kitchen Aid Replacement Beater,The beater turned out not to be the right one for my particular mixer since I went by the dimensions that were on the posting. But the product was great and I decided to keep it for a gift for my daughter.
5,It is great,This is my second one. The first was worn out and chipped. I expect to use this one for another 11 years.
4,Hand washing,"I'm going to be hand washing my new beaters. My original is over 7 years old and still intact, but it was starting to peel and has been lumpy most of its life. I believe leaving it sitting in water and washing it in the dishwasher caused the lumpiness and have decided to wash my new beaters by hand after using them. So far this has worked well and proven to be very easy to do."
3,good product,This only problem with this product is it doesn't hold up well under normal use. I have to replace it about once a year as the white coating keeps cracking or chipping off after about 10 months of use. Is the white coating necessary??
1,Needs a better dersign,"OEM beater replacement works just like new. Unfortunately, this is the third one we have had to replace. The white paint/covering does not hold up."
5,Beater,I was lost without my beater and after I ordered this one I found my other one. It was shipped fast and is sturdy.
3,Paint Chips - Expect to replace it,"I'm not sure if my wife was using her stand mixer to mix rocks or what but the paint chipped off of her original beater and that's why I purchased the replacement. I'm not trying to do a pre-emptive knocking of the replacement, I just anticipate the paint chipping off of this attachment as well. If anyone knows why this happens, definitely let me know and maybe I can avoid from eating lead paint chips in my cake and I can also spare the expense of having to buy more of these in the future."
2,Plastic coating peels off.,Plastic coating is not durable and within a week it started peeling off. I replaced it with the non-coated one and am very satisfied with that.
4,Works as expected,No complaints and price ok. Seems to be same as OEM part. Hopefully the coating doesn't come off this one.
1,"Fairly soon after purchase, coating came off","Not sure what happened to Kitchen Aid quality. Not long after buying this, the coating began chipping off the bottom. Don't really want non-stick coating in my doughs and batters. Very disappointed."
3,Paddle Attachment,"I love my kitchen aid mixer! I use it all the time, expecially at Christmas time. However, the paddle attachment and other white coated attachments peel and chip. Who knows where it ends up? Probably in those cookies I'm feeding my family. Although I love my kitchen aid, the attachments need to frequently be replaced, therefore I rate this a 3."
1,poor quality,Bought this as a replacement beater for my Kitchenaid mixer. The newly purchased beater began to chip within 4 months.
1,Why don't they just make a metal one!?,"Seriously, the paint totally chips off the bottom AND the sides in random places. I have a 2nd 6-qt kitchen aid mixer & the paddle is made of metal, why can't they make this smaller version the same thing? I would complain to the company but I heard they don't care anyway. They are just lucky the mixer is nice enough to warrant buying a new attachment so we don't have to eat paint chips."
5,Great purchased,I saved some of my $$ by purchasing this item because it's cheaper compare to Macy's and Fred Myer stores. Thanks Amazon!
2,beater to bowl clearance,"Recently, we discovered the existence of ""beater-to-bowl clearance"" relating to our 6 QT. KitchenAid stand mixer. Since we bought the mixer, it has left gray streaks when mixing anything white like icing, cream cheese, cake mixes, etc. We replaced the ""metal"" beater for a coated-metal one but the coating began to wear off. Recently, the online KitchenAid agent said the company not long ago added an online video on how to use the mixer. It would have been nice to know at time of purchase in 2007 that buyers should look for such issues as ""beater to bowl clearance."" This could possibly have been a serious issue when we bought the mixer! But now it's over 3 years old. This KitchenAid agent could only suggest that we have the mixer calibrated since turning the adjustment screw as shown in the manual did not resolve this problem. Considering the closest ""repair"" shop is about 300 miles away and they charge $190. plus s/h each way, this is not making me a happy camper!"
1,Not a quality product,I've used this part maybe 10 times and all of the coating is completely gone off the bottom. It makes me sick to think of how much of that coating my kids ate after it was baked in. Not pleased at all and will not order this part again.
2,Lots of filing to be done,This item looked nice but would not fit on to the mixer. There was lots of white coating inside the part that attaches to the mixer. After some discussion with my wife I got the files out and spent about half an hour filing the piece until it fit. Time to check quality control.
3,Dont waste your time....,"Please purchase this product instead......""New Metro Design Beater Blade for 5-Quart KitchenAid Tilt-Head Mixers"".Same attachment, but with better results. Trust me.This product is the stock beater that is not dishwasher safe (go figure). The new Metro Beater blade is and works much better. Just make sure you order the correct size for your mixer (4.5 / 5 Qt, 6 Qt).Good luck."
4,"Great, but on my third beater","As other posters have indicated, this works great until the coating starts to peel and flake. I am about to order my third beater. It does not scrape the bottom of the bowl; rather, it seems to wear down just from use after a couple of years."
3,Enamel chips from beater attachment,"I have a Kitchen Aide mixer and my beater chips too. What a disappointment! I wanted this mixer for years and didnt buy it because of the expense, but once I broke down and got one, I was soooo disappointed that the beater has chipped off pieces of paint. This is an outrage. I am disgusted that enamel chips have been ending up in the food I so meticulously make from scratch and feed to my family. I think the company should stand by their product and replace these substandard parts that come with this expensive appliance. I like the mixer (5 stars) but the beater attachement (1 star) is a huge disappointment, hence, 3 stars averaged out."
4,Didn't fit at first...,"I bought this to replace my chipped beater that came with my mixer purchased at Costco. It's the right beater for the mixer, but didn't fit when it arrived. I used a metal file and filed out the inside a bit and it fits/works fine now."
4,Great,It makes the dough easier to release from the beater without a lot of scrapping. It works just like my old one.
2,Way too short,This attachment is way too short for my mixer. :( I'm quite disappointed. Cannot use it as it is several inches from the bottom of the bowl.
5,mixer accessory,This mixer accessory performed exactly like the OE mixer accessory we were replacing. Fit was perfect and performance was the same as when mixer was new.
1,Doesn't fit on my mixer,"I ordered this as a replacement for my Kitchenaid Classic. According to Kitchenaid it should fit, but it doesn't. I waited too long and now I can't return it."
5,just what I'd hoped,"This beater was cheaper than a lot of places, so I was wondering a little if it would be right, but it was exactly what I'd hoped for. Works great, and isn't chipping or anything like the one I've had for about 7 years is. It arrived right when they said it would also."
3,Kitchenaid replacement flat beater tool,works great no issueseems a little pricely for what it isbut was needed so worth it
1,Junk quality,"I wish they'd make the 4.5 quart beater out of metal.The coating flakes off in the dishwasher, and just from normal use when handwashing. It seems I have to buy one of these every YEAR for $10-15 which really upsets me."
5,Works beautifully!,Purchased this Flat beater to replace the old rusted one. Arrived early and as expected. Still working exactly as expected after 5+ months! Thank you Amazon.com!
5,Perfect,"I needed a replacement beater for my KSM90, and this was exactly what I needed. It fits and was reasonably priced with free shipping."
1,paint chips off...AGAIN,"Two stars for lasting ALMOST nine months, dear KitchenAid. The white paint/coating is chipping off in earnest now and I've already dropped a chip in the batter while it was running. There's no need for KitchenAid not to have figured out this problem by now. This mixer has been on the market for over a decade! Don't buy this with the expectancy of it lasting beyond a year. Another 21st century ""disposable."" Alas."
1,"Yup, paint chips off, KitchenAid doesn't care","Well, ours is less than 30 months old and the top of the attachment is chipping away. So I called KitchenAid and their response was ""these are considered disposable parts and are covered for 1 year. Anything after that you have to buy a new one. They are only $15 each."" Great, I paid big bucks for a mixer that will last 20+ years but over that time I will pay for ANOTHER mixer by purchasing new attachments every other year. That's a nice business model they have going."
3,"Good, but . . .","This object is painted. That is OK, but the paint chips and someone gets to eat it. We have to replace these frequently. If it were coated with epoxy that might be better. Kitchen Aid makes a beater that is uncoated and therefor does not chip, but does not do well in the dishwasher. An unpainted beater with an anodized treatment would be ideal, I think, or one made of stainless steel."
2,Chipping at my brain!!,"I run a small at home cake decorating business, and of course, I do bake a ton of cakes. However, within just 2 months worth of use the sides have started chipping. The first thing I did when I got my mixer was to do the dime test to see if it was adjusted and do so every other week. This isn't the problem, I am not for sure why it is that sides are chipping when it doesn't usually get all the batter on the sides. Well anyways... I would recommend everyone to look atKitchenAid Flat Beater, Burnishedbefore going for this one again. I wouldn't want paying customers to get a mouth full of coating chips in their cakes!"
4,Don't put in dishwasher,"This is the third of these I've had to buy. Certainly the KitchenAid does a wonderful job but I wish they would make these out of stainless like their other beater. The white coating chips and peals and falls into the food. Apparently it is because I've been putting it in the dishwasher. However, as far as ordering from Amazon goes, the beater arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I gave it four stars because it does a good job but it does not last as long as you would expect a KitchenAid product to last."
5,The Work of Charles Richard Drew,"In 1939 the shadow of war hung over the entire world, and medical science had become increasingly concerned with ways to store blood. Dr. Charles Richard Drew is the man who found a means by which blood might be stored and made it possible to set up blood bands so that it would be available in emergencies. He went on to study blood plasma and found how it could save lives. Timely research since bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, and many lives were saved because of Drew's discoveries. This is the story of Drew's work and research. It's illustrated by Samuel Kweskin, and is a most informative work. It amazes me to think of the wonderful discoveries Drew made, and what a difference it's made to the world, even though we now take it for granted."
2,"Fits well, but...","This item fits very well, the only problem is that it creeps up constantly, so you are forever reaching under your shirt or sweater to tug it back into place. I thought that the bottom part would be more form fitting, but it is quite loose."
3,Super Joe:The Life and Legend of Joe Charboneau,"Although this book is dated to the early '80's, it is a facinating real-life account of a baseball hero who succumbed to the celebrity pressures of instant stardom. The book's main character, Joe Charboneau, was a rising star in the Major Leagues who fell to over-indulgences such as drugs, drink and egotism. A very truthful portrayal of Charboneau's struggles are documented in this sports special."
4,A look back at what might have been!,Super Joe Charboneau was a one-year wonder back in the early eighties for the Cleveland Indians. He won Rookie of the Year and then never really played again. I spent that magical summer just east of Cleveland as an eight year old buying pack after pack of Topps baseball cards hoping to get his rookie card just found out that he had written a book. What I did not realize is that this book was written in the off season after he won RotY and it is full of promise and hopes of a long baseball career. It was not meant to be. I still have my rookie card in my den and now I have a better understanding of the man who electrified all of northern Ohio for that one summer. Go Go Super Joe!
1,There is truth in the title,"If you're willing to pay $ 452 for a paperback, you will indeed be ""happy for no good reason"". Besides, I thought this book was the blockbuster to end all blockbusters? So how come there aren't 10,000+ copies available for a dime and a nickel?Let me guess. ""Happy for no good reason"" makes people so unbelievably happy, that they just don't want to part with their copy, thereby pushing up the prices? (For more on this, please consult Adam Smith's ""Sad for a good reason: The perils of early dawn capitalism"". With a foreword by Milton Friedman and Boris Yeltsin.)Personally, I need reasons to be happy. Besides, everyone knows that ALAN WATTS IS THE MAN! So who needs Swami Shankarananananada, anyway?:P"
1,Forget the cookbook,"Read the book, What Would Jesus Eat, but don't waste your time or money on the cookbook. The book contains great common sense and Biblical reasoning for correcting the way we as Americans eat, and it includes plenty of recipes and instructions for changing your eating habits. The cookbook was very disappointing and isn't in the same league as the book."
2,Unimpressive,"The name Ellis Peters in the title of the book was clearly meant to lure readers. None of the writers are up to her standards. There is no shame in not being a master but it left me feeling a little cheated. There were a couple of stories that I kinda liked but the rest were forgettable except two were downright yucky. And the tributes to Ellis Peters written by each and every author were so uninteresting that I didn't bother to read any of them through.The biggest sign of how unimpressed I am with this book -- I am going to give it away which I never ever do, but I feel kinda guilty that I am going to inflict this lame book on some poor soldier in Iraq. I shall have to include better reading material and some snack food in the box."
5,perfect,I got these for the color. Easier to see while playing and easier to find when you have to chase them down
5,In the USA at last!,"Read this book back in '94 during a trip to Scotland... for years I hoped an American publisher would be smart enough to pick it up. Finally. McLean is fresh and original and makes mudane middleclass Scottish worker/slacker lives vibrate with an underlying potential for doom... or at least a good fistfight. These short stories all held me, and sometimes shook me violently about the arms and head. Fantastic. May McLean have a long prolific life. I'll read them all. Check out the novel ""Bunkerman"" as well."
4,Perfect Introduction to McLean's Range,"From the author of the totally creepy Bunker Man and the deftly delightful Blackden comes this collection of 23 short stories ranging in length from a half-page to 42 pages. McLean's voice and fine writing is as evident in these short works as in his two novels. If one placed each of his novels at the end of a spectrum of creepiness and wholesomeness, the stories in this collection would fill the gap between them. Indeed, the longest story, ""Hours of Darkness"" shares many of the creepy and ultimately nasty characteristics of Bunker Man, while others such as ""Tongue"" or ""The Druids S***e It and Fail To Show"" hearken to Blackden. As a whole, the collection is a great example of the new Scottish writing, and a perfect introduction to McLean."
3,well written if underwhelming,"These stories describe the antics of contemporary Scottish pond life. But they do so in a flat, affectless voice. The experience is akin to half watching other people whilst waiting in a bus station. Only slightly more diverting than watching dry leaves being blown about on a crisp autumn day."
1,Too hard to read,"This is my second water-resistant Lonely Planet map, and I'm very disappointed with it. The color contrast is too pale, and the printing is too small. I won't use it for my trip, opting instead for a free map from AAA which is very good. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Does the work - WELL,"There is not much to say about a phone cable. - it's a phone cable!I use this cable to connect my TIVO to the phone, and i have to say that my cat (emily) did her best to kill it, and it didn't work.. (and she more or less ruined everything else in my apt).any way - if you need a phone cable , this is a good choice!"
4,Good cable,"What can I say? Unless it is a really cheaply made cable it will work fine. This is not a really cheaply made cable, not it it a ""cheap"" cable in it construction. It is working just fine for my needs."
2,Design flaw,"The light works okay .. a little better than the built in light on my HG10 .. but this item suffers from a serious design flaw. It sits really low, so if you attach an optional lens on the front of your camera you get a shadow cast across the bottom 50 per cent of your frame .. the lens's shadow! Just crazy poor design. This light should sit a lot higher."
4,Nice Light,"This light works well up to 7 or 8 feet. The color looks natural on people, and it isn't too bright for talent looking at the camera. If you need something stronger, there are options, but this is great for taking grain out of the picture, and adding nice light at shorter ranges."
5,Great light,This is a great light for the Canon GL2. I would recommend it to anyone who owns one of the GL models. the illumination is so powerful you can be in complete darkness and still get a clear shot.
2,Smaller lamp than I expected.,"I am a home user with enough knowledge but not any where near a professional.The image of this map at amazon looked big, and hence i thought the light would be bright enough.My intended use was indoors, mainly home and party halls. I was expecting the light to be brighter than what a normal lamp could provide, but it was much less brighter than a most of the bulbs could provide at home.I did not find it very useful. May be if i am in a dark place like a cave etc.. where you do not have an option of other source of light, this would be useful ( i think, but not really used it in such a place).I felt like I could have bought a better brighter bulbs at home instead of this video light."
1,"Of little value, but big price!!!",This book is very expensive for the quality. Don't buy it and drop any class that uses it if you are a serious student of finance.
1,Trash,"The book is completely dry and void of any practical use. Aside from that of holding up your wobbly coffee table, I suggest that you not purchase this."
1,Hate it,"I just started my MBA program, and this is one of my text books. It's hard to read and incredibly boring. It also does little to help along the student with no prior Finance experience."
4,Excellent Guide,"As part of the process of learning Corporate Finance, I found the guide to be extremely useful in solving problems and applying the theory to the practical stuff. In general, Ross et al deliver an easily understandable book but the best is how he takes most of the concepts at a much deeper level that you can find in many specialized books (actually many of those specialized books refer back to Ross!!!!)"
4,An excellent introduction to Finance!,"A very good book that explains everything in a very simple way, with clear examples. One could wish for a more profound mention of APT, since one of the authors is Stephen Ross, but great nonetheless!"
1,"Horrible, as other reviwers have said!","My son was given this as a gift. I got it put together OK, it was a little difficult, but I got it together. However we quicky noticed the wheel does not turn, the pedals get stuck and even I can't get it to turn right. If I can't turn it how is my 2 year old suposed to learn to pedal? It now sits in the yard dry rotting in the sun, the kids don't play with it."
2,frustrated,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves to try and ride his big brothers bike, so I wanted to get him one more his size to get him used to the pedaling thing. The pedals stick and make this a very hard bike to ride, so he just scoots around on it. If the pedals worked properly it would be great. I actually bought two of these, one for my friends 2 year old daughter so they could play together and her bike has the same problem."
5,Very Entertaining,The conceit of this book is to pair a prof of philosophy with a movie .The prof then tells us the underlying philosophy of the flick. Doesn't sound promising but it works. The profs selected to write---unlike most others---are clear and to the point. They are also fair---the one writing the chapter on Crimes and Misdemeanors talks about alternate interpretations. The one on American Beauty gives an interesting and convincing take on its Buddhist implications. Good chapter on Pulp Fiction. The book really enhances the experience of watching the movie. I also now give screenwriters even more credit for creating works of art.
2,Not sure about the theology,I am not sure about his theology. He says that he belives some type of beings other than humans existed on this plant. He also says that the Bible does not discuss this. The Bible only discusses the human race. So why talk it about it at all? Whether another race existed or not shouldn't be the topic. The book did not have the answers I was looking for and was not a help to me.
3,Previously Released Material,"The Definitive 50 Episode Wild Kingdom Collection contains portions of six previously released Wild Kingdom DVDs with the complete episodes from the Hunters of the Sky DVD. Good collection if this is your first Wild Kingdom DVD which is an excellent series of programs. However if you already own Wild Kingdom DVDs this collection will include episodes from previously released DVDs.The episodes included in the Definitive 50 Episode Wild Kingdom Collection are all from previously released Wild Kingdom DVDs as follows:The African Wild - Disks 1 and 3.The African Wild 2 - Disk 3.Australia's Awesome Animals - Disk 2.Dangerous Encounters in the Wild - Disks 1 and 3.Hunters of the Sky - Disks 1, 2 and 3.Mammals of North America - Disks 1 and 3.Wild Cats - Disks 1 and 3."
4,Great memories of childhood,This is definitely geared for purchasers who grew up with Wild Kingdom. My husband and I are 37yrs old and have fond memories of the show. We bought it for our 4.5yr old WHO IS ADDICTED to it. We have to restrict his viewing time.I think it was definitely worth the $$. It is interesting to watch and covers a broad range of animals. the quality is not the greatest but my son hasn't noticed. As one viewer mentioned this is footage from the 60-70's.I would far rather watch this with my son that cartoons.
2,Miele Uprights,"Reviews of vacuums in the first year or two are only partially valid. To understand quality and evaluate the durability of a product several years should have passed. In this case I am reviewing a Miele 175i Powerhouse upright vacuum cleaner purchased this about 5 years ago. It looks just like the S183 but to be honest there are probably some differencesWe found the Miele to be well designed and easy to use. Unfortunately by the mid third year parts started to break and fall off of it. Furthermore, while adequately powerful at the start, it lost its vacuuming power over time. After five years of use I am looking for a replacement.\Miele asks the consumer to pay a premium (we paid $375). However, given the poor durability I would recommend consumers to look elsewhere for a vacuum."
4,"great suction, bad assembly","I bought this vacuum today and tryed it at home - great suction on carpet, removed all pet hair from my long heared German Sheperd, but.....after 10min. of vacuuming the wheels broke appart - it appear to be assembled w/o a spring washer which to keep them on place. Now I have to go to Bad,bath and beyond and exchange it...Hassle again...Otherwise, it was assembled in Germany should be a spotless machine!"
3,A Great BSB Book,"This book was awesome, but not as good as the official book.It probably could have been longer. If you're a big fan and haveevery bsb book, then you don't need this one! It has good pictures though but the info was kind of outdated and could be found in another recent bsb book."
4,Needs Moar Bo0bz,"Exquisite ambiance. However the cinematography, at times, lacked boobs. In addition, the acting fell short of what I expected giving the long standing tradition of the genre. The opening sequence captured our attention with the promise of full frontal female nudity, however that promise was never realized. For a film of this caliber to only contain four breasteses and zero ladyparts is an enormous letdown (in the pants). Therefore I could only rate this film at four stars (one for each boob). At least the ending left things open enough for a second film, and I look forward to breastacular sequel."
3,Can be used with ZR45,"Just so you know, the BP522 battery can be used for the entire ZR series from ZR20 up to ZR90. (I checked the Canon website to verify.). An extended battery is definitely needed because the one provided with the camcorder has such as short battery life. But you can buy a generic battery made by Energizer (ER-C590) for $60-70 at the typical home electronics stores (i.e. Circuit City and Best Buy). You can also go online and find 2.5 hour batteries for as low as $35.99. Can't say whether they last as long as this one, but my Energizer did last for about 3 years with intermittent use (filming my kids...you know how that goes...lots of taping for the 1st year and then less and less as time goes on...)."
4,No problems here :),"Thanks for a great book. It's very important to me to pass on my family heritage to future generations. The book is in great condition, and was a good deal (the antique store in my town tried to sell it to me for much more than I paid here).Thanks for selling a great product!Would highly recommend."
1,Weak biography,"Disappointly poorly done. Statements made without support, poorly written, contributes little if anything new to one's understanding of the man or his work."
4,a quality camcorder,"The ES8200v is a very good camcorder. It has all the necessary features, auto-focus, image stabilization, an LCD flip out screen, etc. It also has a good array of other features like the remote control, the digital effects, a 700x digital zoom, and the Flexi-zone feature that helps keep the important things in focus. The only thing i have found that this camcorder doesn't have is the Sony Nightshot feature, but I don't really see that as a deturent to purchasing this camcorder. Who wants to see home movies in that green, creepy light of Nightshot? It's not digital, but that's not really important unless you plan on making movies on your computer or something. If you just want something to take with you on vacation or something, this is the one to buy. I highly recommend it to all. Happy filming!!"
4,Big Momma 2,I watched it with my two grand kids and we laughed a lot. They want to watch it every time that we're together.
4,Funnier than Friday!! 4.4 stars.,"Martin Lawrence (or His funny alter-ego) Big Momma entertains...and it entertains like Nobody's business! XDI started watching it at like 6:30 A.M. and was like - OK. What movie is this? Martin? Nia Long?! It took Me about 3 minutes to get it.But I truly loved this. I didn't expect to be half as entertained as I was. But this s.h.i.t was funnier than funny! It even surpassed Friday in bringing the funny! Maybe that's cause We've all seen that one to Death??Anyway, when Big Momma teaches the little girl to dance the *initial* time, I laughed out loud so much! ""Put some stank 'on it!""Martin seriously is very underrated for being a big part in this movie. No other movie has made Me laugh and smile so MUCH.4.4 stars."
3,average laughs,"I laughed a few times. The little boy who teams up with Big Momma was funny. This happens later in the film. The old lady that wants to fight Big Momma at the bingo club was pretty hysterical, also. That's about it. Not bad, but the thing is, we've seen men dress up as women in movies for YEARS. It's all been done a bunch of times."
3,It has it's moments...,"I absolutely did NOT want to watch this movie. Why? Because I saw the first one, and did not like it one bit, and I knew that usually the sequel is not as good as the original(which made me believe this movie would be terrible). However, I rather enjoyed this one. Sure, it was extremely corny at times. But, overall it was sort of funny(real funny in parts) and kind of touching in its own weird way. It's not Academy Award material, but if you want to get away from life for an hour and a half, this movie will allow you to do that. :)"
4,Good Clean Fun,"I'll admit it, I was extremely skeptical when my husband brought this movie home. I'm unfamiliar with Martin Lawrence, and I hadn't seen the first Big Momma movie. But my doubts were soon put to rest and I joined the rest of my family in the silly, slapstick antics of Big Momma (why is a man dressed like a woman so much funnier than a woman dressed like a man???).Rare is the movie that you can watch with your kids without covering their ears every other scene. This movie was, for the most part, clean enough for my 8 and 6 year-olds to watch.While this wasn't ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" or ""Tootsie,"" I will definitely be looking for the first Big Momma."
3,It was fine.,"This mildly funny movie is about an FBI agent. He attempts to prevent the president of the FBI from giving the top secret information to theives (they threatened to kill his family). It would be easy for our pro agent, if he weren't fired and hated by the FBI. He ends up taking the cover of Big Momma to collect his info.Like I said before, the movie was mildly funny. Nothing you'd die at, but it may cultivate a few chuckles. The storyline seemed a good one, but wasn't over the top. The movie wasn't boring, and should keep somebody occupied for the time it's playing, but I wouldn't recommend it for serious movie lovers."
5,Big Momma's House 2,"OMG!!! this was a great movie i saw it today it was sooo funny...u gotta see it, it was awesome im not gonna tell u bout it cuz u have to see it for yourself...great movie =)"
2,Embarassingly corny and boringly bad!,"I loved Part 1 of this movie!! But this movie..gosh...can anyone take this for real? There is a kid in this movie about 3 or 4 yrs of age who ""falls"" from high places as a joke!! What is up with that? Any kid who falls ""that far"" to the ground is going to get hurt. So there goes the realism of this film! Also, the plot was just bad! It wasn't as funny as the 1st and I couldn't believe how corny many scenes were!"
3,YOU GUYS HAVE NO SENSE,Here we go again another franchise running the ground and outlining whats not funny and what is?Cheap laughs aint gonna get you anywhere if you dont pull it off.While Martin Lawrence was stale in this flick and all the cliches that go around with this movie it also sets a funny tone when you laugh whens your not supposed to laugh.But the beach scene was a scene stealer you can almost expect that from lawrence himself....Is he comical? Nope just funny looking.With that said people gotta to take this for what it is a Sequel that tries to ride the coattials of its predecisor.I thought some scenes were funny but the story was sorry bland it got me wondering why even bother make this film.I gave it a modest 3 because Anyway you can get dunbHumor it boosts your energy and if that helps you live longer then so be it.
2,funny at moments...,"ain't the best comedy...but still i laughed hard some time along the whole movie :Sthe first one was a little funnier!!but just for a decent rental, it's ok!!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!,"I saw this movie and I could not stop laughing!! I was an extra in this movie. I saw myself in the scene where Malcolm is the safety Eagle. I am really surprised that I saw myself. I also saw my best friend and my 4th grade teacher. Overall, THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!"
1,A new low,"Martin Lawrence should be embarrassed. If this piece of garbage parading as a movie was intended for pre-teens, and teens he should be apologizing to parents nationwide. Granted this was a movie, but what kind of message is he sending out there to kids, that first you won't get hurt anytime you jump face first from the top of shelves, a bunk bed, etc... But what really bothered me was the feeding of the tequila to a small dog. In real life, that dog wouldn't be peppy and happy....he would be dead from alcohol poisoning. I guarantee there will be some kid out there trying that out on his poor pooch. Kids get into enough trouble these days, don't give them any ideas! Shame on you Martin!"
3,Good Movie,"I went and seen this movie last night with some friends. It's a really funny movie, worth seeing."
1,you must feel sry for poor ol mar'in,"role after miserable role,flop after obvious flop,he staggers on.he is the male equivilent of j-notalent.how many flops has she starred in(only she sucks both acting and singing) ?!?!?!? is mar'in that hard up for cash?!?!?! is his ego that inflated he needs to be infront of a camera as often as possible ?!?!?!?!? does he hate himself and is not only torturing us but himself with these flops ?!?!?!? it seems hes trying a last ditch career saving effort.....appealing to pre teens.i guess even they need movies suited for their age group but trash is trash.can i make a suggestion to you mar'in....figure out a way to get back on tv where you were semi humorous for 20 minutes.''best movie ever''......kids........"
2,What audience is this game for?,"I'm not sure who this game was supposed to target, but it certainly wasn't me. While the graphics are ok for the genre, the music is repetitive and immature, and the voice-overs will make your ears bleed. I did however admire that they allow the player to choose between English & Japanese spoken dialogue; unfortunately, the Japanese dialogue is only slightly less annoying. Some of the concepts are new and interesting, but nothing ground breaking. I highly recommend spending your money on a better line of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, or Advance Wars."
2,"Not a ""Complete"" manual","Suposed to be based on a complete tear down, doesn't even touch the front or rear diferentials other than changing the lube. If you want to know more about them look elsewhere."
2,Bummer Purchase,"I purchased this because I bought a 2000 Cherokee with some repairs needed. I wanted to save some money with some DIY repairs. The main repair is that the blower fan does not work. I ordered Haynes b/c chiltons is not available for this vehicle. When I was talking with my mechanic about another car, he said I need to check the relay switch. This book has one paragraph referencing relay switches. Nothing about the specific switch I need to change. I looked up several other issues I wanted to explore and there is nothing. It is all about major repairs or simple service, nothing in between. If it is major, I'd take it to my mechanic and I already know how to change oil and spark plugs. It's the in between that I want to do myself. Live and learn... $23 gone and more to have my mechanic change the relay switch."
3,Too general for many applications.,"This book covers too many years (1987-2001), during which AMC owned the Jeep, then Chrysler owned the Jeep, and revised the Jeep every couple years. This book does address some of the more key differences between the 1987-1996 vs. the 1997-2001 models but still falls short. However, it is good resource to get a good idea of how to approach the problem and seems more organized than the Chilton."
2,generic. Avoid if you have a 001-01 Cherokee at all costs,"I know this may be a bit cheaper than the 2000 page factory service manual, but that doesn't make it worth it. These books cover nothing about the newer XJ ignition system, or anything else on the newer style Cherokees (97+). The basic howto's are OK, but in a few, the torque specs are wrong. Wiring diagrams arent fully correct either.Save your cash, and look the issues up online, and then get the FSM."
3,It's okay,nothing really in-depth here just basic stuff for doing little things on your jeep and fixing minor problems. Good starting point.
1,jeep cherokee owner's manual 1984 2001,"I was very upset as I usually have good experiences at Amazon. However, this particular time was a huge disappointment that caused a lot of problems. The picture and ad both said it covered Jeep Cherokees from 1984 to 2001. I received the book, didn't look closely at the cover before putting in the back seat of my jeep and dropping the car and manual off at the mechanics to have work done on the engine.Apparently I was sent a manual that only covers up till 1999!!!!, so my jeep was dismantled and when he referred to the manual, it didnt' even have the same components. It was a big hassle to find the info needed quickly so I could have my much needed vehicle back on the road. I had to hire another mechanic in addition to my regular one because he had the correct manual in his shop. I had to pay more hours of labor :( based on them mistake made by whoever sent me the wrong book.Karen Hetu"
5,How to fix an XJ 101,"This book is awesome, it shows all the torque specs, main reason I bought it and it also shows all the electrical systems if you ever want to add lights to your XJ offroad capabilities."
4,For Do-it-yourselfer's,"Great book and easy to understand with step-by-step instructions with PICTURES! From simple tasks like changing your brakes or sparkplugs. And even difficult tasks like a complete overhaul of the engine!. If you plan on keeping your Jeep running for a long time without using a mechanic, this is your book! You will save hundreds if not thousands of dollars in labor costs."
4,Useful.,"I keep this book in my Jeep's toolbox in the trunk. It isn't perfect as sometimes it seems a bit vague when it tries to cover over a decade of changes, but it hasn't let me down."
4,It's useful.,"This will come in handy for the amateur mechanic, and it's worth buying. It's not very comprehensive, though, and you will occasionally run into sections that leave a lot to be desired. Use online forums and a Factory Service Manual (FSM - can sometimes find online in PDF format) to fill in the blanks."
3,Mostly good.,"Lots of info, but still does not show what I need it specifically for. A visual and part description of the foam filters within my dash that works with my AC."
3,Jeep Manual,A lot of info but didn't contain ANY info on the area I wanted to know about - the crankcase position sensor and testing the coil. I was disappointed and found better info on line at the local library.
2,Poor coverage of all years,The manual mainly covers the earlier years. Later models are more mentioned.
2,it shouldnt have jeep on the cove,i bought a haynes manual for a 1997 jeep cherokee country ..everthing i look up only goes to 1996 ..im going to use it to light the fire in my garage
3,Meh,"Pros:As for as alcohol based after shaves, this one worked the bestI don't mind that good burn feelingCons:StickyThe bottle's label will start to shed rather quickly, it gets everywhere and sticks to things.I have been experiencing better results with using an all natural after shaveDries my skin outIt was good while I used it, but i've more on to more natural after shaves. My skin is much smoother, no burn, and no bottle stickin stuff everywhere"
5,Works great - smells a bit funky,"Others have posted how horrible the smell is. It does smell bad, but it is luckily not a strong smell. It goes away rather quickly and when it dries, I put on a different after-shave and that seems to take care of it.As far as how the product works - they are not lying - give it 48 hours and you are good to go. My neck is ultra-sensitive and I have used all of the sensitive skin products, but it still looked like I shaved my neck with a dull cheese grater - even an electric razor caused breakouts for me. Now I use this after I shave and I don't have any problems.PROS: Works just as advertised, keeps the bumps from coming backCONS: smells bad, stings a tiny bitOVERALL: The performance more than makes up for the bad smell - and the smell goes away rather quickly. Give it a shot, I hope it works as well for you as it does for me."
4,Bump Patrol,This is the best product of its type I have ever used. That includes the Bump Patrol shaving cream. The combination of the shaving cream and after shave essentially eliminate ingrown hairs.
5,5 Stars,I have used this product severalm years and I am completed satified. will order more soonThank YouLorenzo Young
5,The same bump patrol I've come to love!,"The only thing that has ever worked for my razor burn is Bump Patrol. I used to have to buy it at a local national store, but it was only available in the 2 oz package and cost $8. This is the same bump patrol I've come to love but in a larger, more economically priced package. If you've never used bump patrol, it has a strong alcohol odor when applied and can feel slightly sticky for the first 10 minutes after application. Not in a distracting manner - just something you notice if you touch your face shortly after use. The alcohol smell disappears very quickly and the final application actually smells quite pleasant afterwards. As far as results - I went from enough razor burn on my neck to look like a teenage kid's acne war to no razor burn in two uses. (Each use was after shaving once a day.) If you have any issues with razor burn and haven't had any luck dealing with it, you have to give this product a try."
1,A Muddy Mass of Dead Writing about Lifeless Zombie Sycophants->Pointless and poorly written,"I'm about the same age as Lunch and saw her perform a few times in NYC. I enjoy revisiting tales from The Scene as much as any other aging Punk and I'm pretty hard to shock, but this ""book"" was repulsive, shocking and utterly pointless.The writing was unpolished and apparently unedited. It read like either a rough draft of a 12 Step Self Inventory or a diary from a teenager with no super ego. I got through about 60% of this, uh, writing and gave up. There wasn't anything to keep me slogging through the endless war stories of demeaning, self deprecating, illegal and anti social behavior. There was not a sympathetic character in the whole kit-n-kaboodle. Just a muddy mass of dead writing about lifeless zombie sycophants.I removed it from my Kindle. It was that ooky."
1,Depressing,"Lydia as monster... don't expect anything about her musical career, since it is about being a predator seeking satisfaction anywhere she can get it... whether or not it's real, it is certainly unpleasant..."
3,Better than the tripe that is 50 shades of lame.,"Lydia Lunch takes the stance that her childhood disaster made her the predator she was... still is? One point made about one of her relationships was that he was a great liar, charm and lust all over. Recognizing those attributes in oneself doesn't make them go away. Unless some heavy therapy was done but not written about, the main character in this particular book is still the same, only now the wrinkles and sagging of age have set in. Lydia has always been compelling, and the first half of the book was like reading Patti Smith's book on dust... the negative twin of it. Ending tacked on and no real summation. And having eternal submissive Thurston Moore try to sum up Lydia just creeped me out. Talk about an easy mark..."
2,what the hell?,"This is disgust and insanity. I mean I knew it would be shocking, but not to this degree. I guess I'm thankful that I've lived a pretty sheltered life and no one of this makes any sense to me. I just like her spoken word, but that's about it. I feel sorry for all the wretched souls out there who've lived these atrocious lives. God give them a soul."
2,Poor Quality and Way too bright,"I have a Canon GL2 and am a professional videographer. I purchased this light due to reviews saying the VL-3 was not bright enough. However, this light is way too bright to not have tilt and swivel capabilities. Your subjects will always squint when this light is pointed at them.Also, this product does not interact with the advanced hot shoe, it only attaches there. This means there is no advantage of the Canon branded light over a 3rd-party/generic version.The cost of this light is based on the Canon name alone, because the quality construction is also poor. The battery does not firmly seat into the light so any sudden movement makes a loud clicking sound on your recording.If your lighting needs can be accomplised with the VL-3, purchase it. It is auto on and off and makes no sound on your recording.If you need a strong light, buy a 3rd party one with barn doors and tilt and swivel ability."
1,Battery not included,"I was very disappointed to receive this light and find that the battery, an apparently expensive Lithium Ion battery, is not included. I can't comment on the light as I have yet to find a battery that fits anywhere near my home that is less than $100. Unfortunately, the seller didn't offer them as a package (which would have generated an additional sale and revenue.) I am undecided about whether it's worth the trouble to track down an appropriate battery and am seriouly considering returning the light for a refund."
1,Both the CD and the artist are horrible.,Ever just totally stop liking a artist because their attitude is full of themself? I had all the hopes of hearing this track because I am a huge Bowie fan. But hearing this retarded DJ play it at a gig was a let down. Then the EGOMANICAL attitude this loser had to boot with the crap rendition of the song. Ug turned me off. Just say no to Pompous... DJ's. Bowie's original was better anyway.
5,The ultimate in looks & comfort,"A reasonably priced saddle that is very attractive, vintage style and appears well made. It is comfortable and I top 300 pounds.I enjoy the cultural differences between the Asian suppliers and US customers. It features what has been known for years as a ""crash rail"" not a ""handle""."
4,One of my favorite books!,Thought provoking about humans rediscovering what it is to be human after having been force-evolved into something else by aliens. But my absolute favorite is the beastship Evangeline!
5,Fantastic book.,"Lindholm combines excellent characterizations with an interesting story. The five main characters all evolve in a very natural way from the beginning to the end of the book, and the ending itself is satisfying (although there is room for a sequel). Highly recommended!"
4,Different,"The book kept me entertained, enjoyed the idea that we were being watched then saved and then the different aspects with Tug, John and the beastship."
