5,A must have vocal CD,"This is a must have CD for all lovers of the vocal art. For those who have only recently come to vocal music by way of Bocelli, Amante or Watson listen to this man and be amazed. Franchi sings circles around these contemporary wannabies. His vocal color, phrasing, legato and above all attention to the lyrics put him in a class by himself. This was his recorded intoduction to America, I bought it as an LP when it first came out. It was and is a vocal find. The sound is still first rate and the performance is wonderful. Now all BMG has to do is release his Broadway I Love You album LSC 2674 and we'll have the best of Sergio on CD."
5,A Long-Awaited Release,"I've been waiting a long time for the Sgt. Bilko show to be released on DVD, and this is definitely worth the wait. It's great to finally see these episodes in good quality video and sound. The menues are easy to use, and the extras are fun. Looking forward to seeing all the years released!"
4,Still Funny -,"I enjoyed the Phil Silvers Show when it aired and it's still funny today when viewed years later on these DVDs. However, thinking back on my own experience in the Army, I'm thinking it would have been even funnier if some of the episodes included tricks played by the lower ranks to get out of work, go AWOL, etc. Reality - I never met an Army sergeant like Bilko - too artificial to be believed."
5,Classic TV at its best,My husband actually asked for this DVD for Christmas and I was so thrilled to find it at Amazon. It not only has 18 classic episodes but some fun special features also. This is back when life was so much simpler and color tv was still in the works.
3,What were they thinking?,"First of all, love the series and it's great that they are going to release the entire series on DVD. But why, why, why did they omit a ""play all"" option? Just like the Honeymooners. What savings to CBS could there possibly be? This option is standard on virtually every other series and it's just crazy to not offer this option to the buyer. So it's 5 stars for the episodes, 1 star for the functionality of the DVD. I also second the commenter who is looking for Car 54 on DVD. They can't issue too soon for me."
5,Where's Nat Hiken's Name?,"DVD executive producer Paul Brownstein gave himself credit on this set and the earlier 50th Anniversary Sgt. Bilko collection. But where's the name of the comedic genius behind ""You'll Never Get Rich"" and ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" Nat Hiken was a major force in American radio and television comedy. His name should not be erased from one of his greatest, most enduring creations."
4,Love Shack is my lucky song,At most dances to which I have gone I have danced with someone when this song is playing. Only reason this CD has 4 stars instead of 5 is the original version of this song is not featured on this CD. However the Acapella version is neat and the other mixes are neat as well.
1,Not a useful tool..,"This publication presents a few lines of each sutra, then several pages of commentary. This means that it is difficult to get a proper sense of the originals. It would be better if the original text was kept together, then the commentary included as endnotes.I felt that the commentary added nothing to the clarity of the original texts, and do not provide any benefit at all to the reader, but wreck the integrity of the presentation of the original text. The commentary seems only to say the most obvious things.The sutras itself, it goes without saying, a above all comment. If there was a Ganges river for each of the grains of sand in the Ganges river, would the resultant grains be many? If for each of those grains of saind one was to spen a thousand myriad multimillions of lifetimes praising these texts, still the praise would be insufficient."
3,Basic Information,"I was expecting more out of the book. It's fine for what it is, a book with basic distilling information that shows you how to build a still using fairly easy to obtain materials. Would be good for a hobby distiller who is also a fabricator."
4,like it,like the book alot of info but if you what the bluild a still you better know how to work with metals or know someone who does.
3,Basic recipe for basic production,"This book gives a simple outline to the process of producing alcohol, along with plans to build one very specific setup. The section on grain preparation is very well described in this book, better than the other books that I have read. If somebody is looking to just make some ethanol without concern for the amount of energy required, this book will work OK for you. There are a number of oddities in the design given in this book, such as the concept of a water jacketed boiler. This will result in low rates of heat transfer, with a lot of heat being lost to the surroundings. Also, a batch distillation can not compete with continuous distillation on the basis of energy input. If someone is looking for a DIY batch distillation setup, consider building a Charles 803 column or the one in this book. For somebody who is interested in a robust and efficient process, look else ware."
4,"Interesting reading, but not really very original","This is a book about making a still and producing alcohol. To be blunt, rather high proof alcohol, capable of fueling a car. Vince goes into production of mash, distillation and building the still. Minimal sheet metal tools are needed.Trevor"
3,Alcohol producing still.,"The book presents ONE design for a still. He talks about making it of copper sheet and soldering it togather, I,d rather go stainless steel and TIG weld it. His ""double boiler"" design , with the mash pot totally surrounded seems like overkill to me. Why not just put the boiler undernieght the mash pot, just as if you were melting chocolate.It seems to me that many of the components of this still can be purchased for minor dollars, and adapted to the unit. I picked up a 7 gallon satainless pot with lid from a local surplus outlet for 22 bucks..None the less the book is very informative, and the water cooled condenser is a the tits."
5,Mixing The Two Best Decades!,If you like the Dance/Pop sound of the 80's and the digitized sound of the 90's... Well this group throws it all in the same mix! If you need better sound samples I recommend visiting AudioGalaxy.com. The album is a definite must have though. I can't wait to hear more like this on the charts!
3,Nut flours replace wheat flours here . . .,". . . so if you have a nut-allergic child, (as I do) this is not an especially helpful cookbook for low carb baking. Sigh. Otherwise, the recipes look thoughtfully put together."
4,Outstanding!!,"What a great book with so much information that even I can understand. Ursula Solom has put her heart into this book and I know like many other cooks we are anxious to try out her new recipes and enjoy.I read recently, in an interview, that the author attributes inspiration for the book to being in excellent health. Said having quit all forms of caffeine freed the mind for more creativity. [...]I want to thank the author for writing a really great book."
2,Make sure you're happy with the ingredients used,"This book had some yummy sounding recipes, but they almost all use sugar alcohols and many use soy. The bread recipes use vital wheat gluten. Since I can't eat these items, none of the recipes were of any use to me and I returned the book."
5,Oh Boy Bread,I can't wait to start using this book. If you have been on low carb for any length of time you know you can kiss bread goodbye! But this cookbook had soooo many recipes for so many differant tpyes of bread I really look forward to trying my hand at soon.
1,If you are desperate for baked goods....Updated,"In no way would any of these things be confused with high-carb counterparts!BUT having said that, if you are truly desperate for bread and pasta, and it's going to make the difference for you whether you stay on this way of eating or not, it's worth a try to make some items from this book.I found them to be mostly acceptable. I used to do a lot of baking so I'm not a baking novice; it's just that these carb-substitute items are just NOT the real thing. If you've been low carbing for awhile and are used to the typical texture and appearance of low carb baked goods, you'll do fine with this book.If you are trying to relive your high-carb past with these items, you'll be deeply disappointed. A few things might even make you spit them out.Overall it has some good ideas if you are stuck in the breadless rut and want SOMETHING to help you.UPDATE: Get any of Jennifer Eloff's books if you want baking and dessert ideas, not this one!"
3,its a good buy,i gave this item a 3...it has a place for your ps2 and 2-4(I only have 2 in there and theres still room for more)controllers and two compartments on the side for the wires and stuff in the base.... on the lid it has two nets for your games and three nets for your memory cards...the nets for you games will hold 3 a piece if you stuff the games in there but i find they fit 2 a piece just fine...it has a combination lock that you can set yourself....the aluminum on the outsid seems a little flimsy and the lock wouldnt stop anyone from ripping it open but its there...i like it...ive looked around for something for my ps2 to travel in and ive finally found it.... a good buy...
4,"Ok, but could be better","I bought this case cause i needed something to travel around with my ps2 a lot. It does that job incredibely well, with all the stuff it can hold, but it does appear to be made rather cheaply. The ""combination lock"" is decent, but I cant move the dials when i want to change the combo. The PS2 slot is perfect. It has a velcro strap across the top to hold the unit in and has just the right amount of extra space. The controller spot is perfect too, and could probably hold 4 controllers (i only have two so i wouldnt know. It has two compartments for cables and one of these can hold a small remote. The memory card slots are the biggest problem. They are just smaller then the memory cards themselves, so it took an hour of forcing the card into the slot to get it to fit in, and this forced the fabric to rip a little. For it's price, this is a great buy and is highly reccomended"
3,Great item but PS2 won't fit,"I had purchased this item as a gift for my younger brother for this birthday. It is a great item that represents great quality. However, if you have a PS2 system with the network adapter, it will not fit in this case.<br />This is a MAJOR drawback. I returned the item and I just wish this was listed in the item specifications."
5,Great book,"I am a graduate student of environmental engineering and ordered this book to further expand my knowledge of the field. I was happy to see that it was a huge thick book covering many subjects because I already knew it was a great book. So I was almost sure the material was reliable. I have found this book a great source that explains clearly many aspects of the subjects the other books do not. For example, I was reading the sedimentation theory and searched it on the internet. I found this book on Google Books and found out that it deals with the theory in detail yet clearly. I came across exactly the things I was looking for that I had not been able to find in other books such as ""Metcalf and Eddy"" or ""Reynolds Unit Operations..."" This was the reason I ordered the book then. The text is clear and well-organized. I definitely recommend this book for environmental students. I love this book and happy to have ordered it."
4,Great being a Garfield fan,"Have been for a long time now and i'm glad that i decided to start back. Buying the books and its really convenient with them being released in a 3 pack. Its like a bunch of classics all wrapped together, love it."
4,Satisfied,I was pleased with my purchase. The book was delieverd in the time frame that was stated. It was in the condition that the seller said it would be in. Thank you!
3,An honest effort,"John Frizzel did what he could with what was given to him, creating - through his music - all of the emotion in the film (Weaver and Rider's performances helped somewhat). The score never quite hits it's potential, it seems to be waiting for something. It's action cues never are up to par with Goldsmith and Horners score, but matches Goldenthals in the balance of emotional music and action motifs. The score is enjoyable despite it's flaws. The re-tooling of Goldsmiths theme for Ripley serves the character well. And there are several segements of action music, that by themselves are quite spectacular. Like the film that it was commisioned for- it never quite reaches the level the audience wants- leaving you begging for more. (which is not a good feeling at all) An honest effort to bring back the beast, I'm sure, but sadly, nothing more than an interesting failure. Buy it for the highlights, but don't expect a glorious resolution in the end."
1,Total garbage,"I only bought it because it was cheap. Huge mistake. I can't even begin to list the things that don't work on it. From ""DAY ONE"" Stay away from this mixer at all costs!"
4,Least intimidating book on solar cooking!,"This book is easy to read and use. The information is presented clearly and it is easy to understand. This book is a great source book to teach yourself solar cooking. It is also easy to include younger children. Older children could pick it up and teach themselves from reading it. The recipes are of a wide variety so there should be a favorite for just about everyone. It isn't too ""new age"" as some other books on this subject. Outlines food safety issues very well with easy to remember rules and suggestions for building your own solar cooker. Easy enough for a child to do."
1,Absolutely dreadful recipes,"I am a pro when it comes to cooking with a solar oven, so that was not an issue for me. But the recipes in this book are dreadful. I made the onion dill bread--nasty, and embarassing. I made the yogurt chicken enchilda recipe--couldn't be more boring in taste--also an embarassment to serve for others. I also made one of the grain recipes--more ho hum. This book may be alright for those wanting to get simply educated on using a solar oven, but it's definitely not a worthwhile cookbook. Sorry."
2,Uninspiring Leadership Lessons from the Rangers,"No Excuse Leadership was purchased because I was in the midst of setting up and delivering leadership training to a potential client from the defense forces of my nation.I was quite let-down. I think those from a military and US back-ground would fully appreciate this book.I was looking for a book which would share more explicitly the lessons of leadership from within an army or military context. In this respect, Be, Know, Do from Francis Hesselbein & General Shiseki is a much better read."
4,Good stories,"Most of this book is not about leadership. Instead, it is about what it is like to be an Army Ranger. I would say 15% of the book is dedicated to the subject of leadership in the Rangers.The book hits not so much at the intellectual level, but at the emotions. It does a fine job of describing the ATTITUDE of Ranger leadership. Perhaps it is implying that leadership is mostly about winning attitude.The book holds the reader with its tales of harsh training every Ranger must suffer. Its training is specifcially designed to push every Ranger to their physical and psychological limits, resulting in what appears to be a near death experience to most Rangers. I found it intriguing that Rangers lose sexual appetite during their brutal training because all they can think about is their basic survival (warmth, food, shelter, and overcoming pain) while successfully accomplishing their mission."
4,Great lessons for business leaders,"I really enjoyed this book. I admit that I did not know much about Ranger training before reading it but I have a much clearer picture now and found the stories very interesting. As an executive who manages an elite team in the business world, I found the information directly applicable to my business."
4,Janis Joplin Tie Dyed,"Very nice t shirt, I ordered the wrong size but the quaility of the shirt was great and well made."
1,Wrong Bowls sent and returned twice/Billing a BIG question,I never received the large bowls. The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening either
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE,"THIS DVD IS NOT WORTH IT, INSTEAD BUY ""GENIE GETS HER WISH"" THAT DVD HAS HER SINGING HER BEST SONGS, BEHIND THE SCENES, VIDEOS, PHOTO GALLERY, AND IT'S A LOT BETTER FOR THE MONEY. I THINK THAT DVD IS HER OFFICIAL DVD, THIS DVD WAS MADE BY OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO CATCH IN ON HER SUCCESS. D-DOGG :-)"
1,HORRIBLE! Save Your Money!,"This video belongs in the trash. It doesn't even deserve ONE star. I've watched it once, and that was enough. No music, or anything of interest. All you see are the same people who claim to have known Christina in her childhood days, and for seeing Christina herself, all you see are the same pictures frame after frame, scene by scene. All this is, is a bunch of people who claim to have known her, and are trying to cash in on her success. If you really want it, I'll sell mine to you."
1,a viewer,This video is an unauthorized one meanning that they cannot show footage from music videos and such. That is why it's so bad. Dont waste your money.
1,What a disappointment!,"This video was given to me for christmas. I was so excited, but then when I watched it, there was no music on it from christina, and no performances. They tried to make songs sound like hers but it was really annoying. The critics are not even in high authoritive positions, and a high school girl that ""claims"" to have been a cheer with christina talks about the same thing over and over. I could barely get myself to watch the whole thing."
1,Don't buy this book,"The only good thing about this book is the narratives written by the children. However they are too few. Otherwise the writting was so simplistic and repetative. I had the feeling the author wrote this book on her lunch break. I don't know who this book was written for adults or grade school students. There are many good books on the topic of at risk children but this isn't one of them. Save your money and buy another book like ""Turning Stones"" or one written by Mr. Humes for instance."
2,"If you' ve read one, you' ve read them all....","It seems that all books that refer to ecommerce and respective issues are all alike. This is not a bad book. On the contrary, it makes some very interesting points. But it is no breakthrough. It's just a different way of categorizing the different forms of business currently online. The proposed models are undoubtedly interesting and pretty much cover everything. Unless you are new in this area, don't bother."
2,Academia Ahoy,"I find this book provides an insightful deconstruction of things past - the B2B/B2C business models of the new economy pre April 2001, but neither provides insight into the realities of todays strategic use of the internet as a business channel/media, nor of lessons learned from past failures.More insights from business experience, not academic deconstruction please!"
3,Good but nothing we haven't seen before,"Daredevil and the Punisher are too characters that have fought each other several times over the years. They not only physically fight, but fight over what Justice truly is. If its right for someone to take the law into their own hands or not. This book is a very good example of capturing causalities caught in battles, the thinking of both of these individuals and the art is very solid. While I do like this story I still think that Frank Miller handled this story better (The story I'm talking about is in Essential Punisher volume 2) but then again it is hard to fight Frank Miller when he's at the top of his game."
1,wrong specs,"According to the literature I recieved, and a phone call to the manifacturer, the sfcm is 9.8@50 psi ,not 5.7 as stated. so this puppy has to go back. what a waste of time. I had a project that had to go out.Manifacturer stated not to even bother trying it with my 6.6 cfm compressor."
5,fun book,"My son loves dinosaurs and he was very happy to get his book in the mail. We read the book over and over, it was interesting enough to keep his attention."
5,Great Book,This was my daughter's favorite book when she was a little....now 33 years old. Our four year old grandson is three and it is now his favorite book.
3,Meh,"It's not as charming as all that, and definitely written in a different era - no non-white characters, zoo animals in cages, that sort of thing. There's nothing wrong with that - no sense judging it on our mores - but as it's not overly interesting either I can't sensibly give it more than three stars."
2,"I liked this book as a child, but now I see it as sexist...","The pictures in this book are simple cartoon drawings and everyone in it is very ""traditional"" There is a police ""man"" etc. When Danny and the dinosaur visit the zoo, all the people want to see them and not the regular zoo animals, so the zoo keeper tells them to leave the zoo because the other animals aren't getting looked at and this is making them sad. It has the old ""Ugly American"" feel to it to me. I don't think anyone would learn anything worth while from this book."
4,Two boys' review: Early reader also a great primer for birthday etiquette,"While the title sums up the storyline -- a day in the life of Danny, a boy, and his friend, the dinosaur -- the story is full of make believe and magic that was absolutely riveting to my young boys.The words and the concepts are nicely focused on Level 1 readers (early reader). The book also offers a nice primer for children getting ready to attend a friend's birthday party as the illustrations show many of the iconic activities and how well-behaved children should act in that situation.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly nearly 100 books and Syd Hoff has two other titles in our collection,Danny and the Dinosaur and Happy BirthdayandOliverthat I recommend, too."
3,Solution for Fitment,"I have a similar fitment issue with Moroso 20509. I called Moroso and they they will do the fitting for no charge if I send them my pan, timing cover and rear main. Basically, Moroso will install my parts on their block so they can adjust the pan.While I am not enthused about the down time and having to ship engine parts across the country, I am happy that the experts at Moroso will fix the problem."
3,Color is weak,"Bright incandescent bulb, though the color is rather weak (that is, it's not a rich red color). I think you can do better with one of the compact fluorescent flood lamps."
1,broken,both bulbs came loosley packed and shattered in to a million pieces. they should no better to pack glass with packing and to say fragile on the box!
5,Great Hip Shirt!,This has become my favorite T! The color is great and has not faded after many washes and it is cut just right and comfortable. I bought a large and I am 6ft 180lbs.
3,"Great product, but.......","I picked up several of these on clearance a few months back. They have worked awesome for me with my Sony memory cards. But then the inevitable happened and my old PS2 died on me. Just today, I picked up a new ""slim"" PS2 and this new system is not seeing the paks when plugged in. The lights on the paks seem to have a pulsing glow to them, like the new smaller system just isn't putting out enough power for even one of them to work. I am rather aggitated over this, but I know the product itself DOES work on the older style PS2's, but apparently not on the ""slim"" systems.Take this into consideration when purchasing."
3,O.K. (need some help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!),It was ok at first but about a year later my PS2 (i have the origanal) won't recognize it. It just makes the light blink and does nothing. My regular memorycards work but the 8mb expansion pack isn't recognizable. i've tried everything...Has anyone else had this problem... If so how did you fix it thxDan
1,dosent work,i got mine in the pro gamers case for the orignal ps2 and it dosent work with my sony 8 mb memory cards in my slim ps2. all i wanted was the case and the dvd remote but the controller and this piece of crap were a *bonus*
1,plain cheating,"product packaging makes you think that it is an 8MB memory card which lets you add another 8MB in the same slot. PS2, however, does not recognize the memory until you insert an original 8MB memory into this expansion package. it is a total rip."
4,A very sterile look at Thermonuclear War,"The acting is excellent, SFX is shockingly bad, even for that time. The movie does not even scratch the surface of the truth of war. Thsi film is excellent from acting, writing, and diretion standpoints. On realisim, it falls pitifully short. I am not going to get into the nit-picking, as it is out of the scope of this review. But on the other sied of the coin, back in '83 when this was shown on ABC, TBS was getting ready to air ""Threads"" a British film based on the same concept. What a dog of a film. But since no one else has made one since, there is really no basis for the genra, Nuclear war movies. I did enjoy this film, regardless of the tech flubs."
1,Horrible,"This is Killa Tay's worst CD. Yeah he found god or whatever but then he spends half this CD complaining about the white man and hatin on whitey, well guess what fool over half your fans were white, and we ain't feelin this one. For a real Tay CD go pick up Mr. Mafioso or Snake Eyes."
1,What happened to Tay Capone?,"Ok I am down with almost all Sactown rap, Killa Tayused to be one of my favorites when he was clicked upwith the Dosia Clicc (get the Dosia cd, Waiting to Exhale,it is with him, Lunasicc, Pizzo, Marvaless, KJ, and it'sthe most bangin CD you will ever hear, he representsthe Coast to the fullest [if you know what's craccin])on that one. But this Thug Religion was a total failure,he goes off on his newfound religion (don't get me wrong,I'm religious) but he talks about hatin on white people inat least 2 or 3 tracks, the gangsta in him seems to havesoftened up, NOTHING like Mr. Mafioso (his first, a classic)or Snake Eyes (also pretty good). Also even checc outThug Thisle but whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS CD it succsbad."
5,History comes to life.,"It is a joy to sit down with an ""old-timer"" and listen to stories of times gone by. This is a slice of American history, a first-hand account of the beginning of the age of automobiles and the transition away from horses as major work animals to the machinery that (sadly for some) replaced them. It was a pivotal point in American history. The Indians had been forced off their lands and ""progress"" took over. Lee J. Daniels spent his life dealing with horses, mules, cattle, sheep and knew the horrors of the Chicago slaughter houses as well as the ins, outs and tricks of horse trading. What an exciting, long life he had. This book was truly a pleasure to read.Betsy S."
4,WWF Fully Loaded 1998 review,"The Jeff Jarrett-Val Venis match was kind of boring but still good. The match between D-lo Brown & X-Pac had lots of high-flying action and it was pretty good. The Faarooq/Scorpio-Terry Funk/Justin Bradshaw tag team match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Vader-Mark Henry match. The D.O.A-L.O.D 2000 tag team match was slow & boring. The Owen Hart-Ken Shamrock-Dungeon match was a solid/back-and-forth bout even with Owen cheating at the end. The 2 out of 3 falls match for the IC between The Rock & HHH was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,entertaing,smash-mouth match of the night. The Jacqueline-Sable-Bikini contest was pathetic & dirty. No matter how much men loved it. Leave those dumb constests for bars & beaches. The World tag team championship match between the team of The Undertaker & Steve Austin against the team of Kane & Mankind was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,ruthless,entertaining tag team brawl. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
3,Not bad,"It's good but not great. It really was a set up for SummerSlam, and it shows. Rent, but dont buy."
4,"Talk to me at my E-mail Colokirks@juno.com, just as for Evan","The Tag Team Championship match was great. I am the biggest Undertaker fan, so you do not know how it felt when he got the title with Stone Cold Steve Austin. I hope that they could team up in the future cause then they could again be the TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS OF THE WOOOORRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLD!!!!!"

2,"A terrible event, just look at the cover to prove it!","The WWF obviously didn't want to sell very many of this video, you just have to look at the front cover to prove it. The main event features Kane and Mankind led by Paul Bearer put their WWF Tag Titles on the line against Austin and Taker. The elements are all there it's just the main event never really comes together, there are a lot better WWF videos to buy then this one, and you must be fully loaded if you're gonna spend money on this lame pay-per-view. Lazy booking by the WWF."
4,Undercard Was GREAT,The undercard was the best of the year but the main event wasn't what you'd expect from those four
2,OK,Sable should of showed her boobies without the sticky hands.I think Capital Carnage is better because jackie showed her boobies without the sticky hands
5,Art Songs,As an elementary art teacher it helps to have children learn things musically to reinforce retention (ie the abc song). The songs are bouncy and inviting. The PE teacher is using some for gym activities that re-exposes my first graders to learning primary and secondary colors. Great CD.
3,Not a how to use book,"Be aware! This is NOT a how to use NetObjects Fusion guide.This is a good book if you're looking for an overall design concepts and philosophy discussion. It does feature an excellent development tool, but barely touches on how the tool works.I did think this book was poorly done from the respect that the author references chapters that don't exist. Points you to Figure numbers that don't exist or are incorrectly numbered, etc. It appears considerable editing was done after the author wrote their references. Rush to press strikes again."
3,I Didn't read the description correctly (My fault - not the vendor),"I had just purchased NetObjects Fusion 12 on line. I didnot read the description of this book thoroughly, and thought I was ordering version 12 (instead of version 2). My Bad!"
3,Manufacturing Defects,"Firstly: we noticed that some of the DVD's have been printed incorrectly, we have to insert each DVD into the player to find which one is which. For example disk two series two is printed as disk two series six. There are about four DVD's like this. VERY annoying.Secondly: We love the show, the first three series are the best, but it's always good to get the box set."
5,Healing knowlegde all healers should know,"I have been doing laying on of hands for about 8 years now and this book summarizes the process in an interesting and understandable manner. The writer's style and structure brings the process to life with ease. To understand this subject well, knowledge about all types should be presented... and this authors does. A book you would not regret buying or having. I will be buying a few extra copies for my students and friends for gifts."
5,Domke does it - Excellent Bag,"Took me a while to decide on a bag because I wanted one to fit all of my gear comfortably in a neat compact size and have a hip/waist belt accessory. This bag does it all well. I got the black one and the canvas is a plus.My gear fits like this;Main Compartment-2 Nikon D700 bodies one with battery grip1 Nikkor 24mm-70mm 2.8 (not a small lens thus mounted on a body)1 Nikkor 135mm 2.01 Nikkor 85mm 1.81 Nikkor 20mm 2.8 (smallest)Side pockets-2 flashes SB 800 and 900 (with room to spare)Front pockets-16 aa batteriesSd8A flash battery packInternal Pockets-Extra camera batteries, Memory cards, lens Caps etc. etc.Its a bit heavy...but that's the gear not the bag and I also got the shoulder pad accessory it a very nice addition. The bag can fit two bodies with mounted lenses or just one mounted and another body. Its also nice traveling size easily fits in the overhead.All in all I'm very pleased, its an excellent bag."
4,Great Bag; None more Useful,"While this bag is a tad heavy, it has every feature I wanted. The price is right, the constructions is top-notch, and I can safely place all of my equipment in it. I have the Canon 7D with battery pack grip, the 580exII Speedlite; Canon 100mm Macro, Cannon 70-200mm, extra batteries and miscellaneous supplies, and SLIK monopod. The bag simply works quite well."
5,This Is The Bag For You If You Carry Lots Of Gear,"Like most photographers, I've got more than one bag. This is the one I use daily. It's big and can carry so much gear it's scary. I carry two full sized bodies with large lenses attached, 2-3 additional lenses, two pro flashes and still have room for filters, cleaning supplies, remote triggers, cables, batteries & battery packs etc.It's as tough as it is roomy and only gets better with age. Is it gonna fool somebody into thinking it's not a camera bag? Heck No! This is simply the best bag for daily use I've ever used.The shoulder strap is wide and is quite sturdy, but if you want comfort while slinging this fully loaded beast on your shoulder, get the available ""postman"" style pad for it as well. It really saves your shoulder and keeps the strap from slipping off your shoulder.Domke builds working bags for working photographers."
5,Back in Control,"Simple, easy guidelines that make sense. In a world of children that have been brought up with little boundaries, this book helps keep you focused and on track. We have spoiled our children because we love them. Sometimes we go overboard to make up for other deficits in our kids lives. The problem is that our guilt gets in the way of good parenting. We want to give them everything. The truth is, they don't need everything. They need to learn patience instead of getting instant gratification. They need to feel a sense of accomplishment when they've completed a project. Instead, we complete the project for them because we don't want them to get a lower grade. This book is terrific for concise, clean management for your parenting style."
1,Compiled information of other Authors,"Pass on this book, pass on Mr. Bodenahmmer's back in control program - he kills teens (Willilam ""Eddie"" Lee), his back in control program has been temporarily shut down by the state of Oregon, not allowed to practice in California.Mr. Bodenhammers books read like 1939 Nazi Propaganda.I have read Mr. Bodenhammers books - there's better information out there. This book merely is a recruiting tool to con people into giving Mr. Bodenhammmer $16K + to abuse their children.Like a bad ""B"" movie,....run.New Legislation will eventually catch people like Mr. Bodenhammer, problem is, how many teens will suffer in the mean time?"
3,Gives great tips.,The book was recommended by a colleague. It give great tips and examples of how the parent's inconsistency sends mixed messages to the children. It is worth buying used for reference materials.
3,good beginner,"Bought two of these, the other ""sunburst"". Other than the color everything I thought was the same but the metallic blue felt a lot heavier and the whammy bar was so much tighter.I am very happy with the sunburst vs the metallic blue. Strings don't stay in tune for long on either, should upgrade on strings. Nice starter."
1,this is a joke!,when i received this product i was very upset. the fret lines were so long they cut my fingers the neck was warped and the guitar was virtually unplayable. i sent it back! i would NOT recomend this product to anyone!
1,A real piece of junk,"Don't waste your money as the guitar would not tune. Contacted seller Austin Bazaar and they sent me a RMA but will not reimburse the $18.85 shipping to return the item. Bought this for my grandson and my son who has been playing guitars for 20 years could not tune this junk. Also, still waiting for credit for full cost of this so-called merchandise. Have filed a claim with Amazon under their A-Z program but heard nothing so far. This is a big headache and suggest you not buy this item and save yourself from the trouble. I can only hope since I am a regular customer that Amazon will honor my claim and reimburse me the $18.85. Will update everyone later after this is resolved. Can't believe any of the good reviews and wonder what those folks were smoking or if they ever played even a half-way decent beginners guitar. The price should have warned me but..."
3,okay guitar,"i purchased this guitar because i wanted too learn how to play, and this was at a cheap price. it came quckly. when i opened the box, i noticed there were manufacturing flaws. for example, the knobs on the guitar each had a little brown cut on them. this disapointed me. next, i found two bumps on the body of the guitar. i thought it was just the cover protector, but it was a flaw. overall, it sounded good and was easy to play. the amp was extraordinary for how small it is. but if you are a dedicated guitar player and are looking for youre 2nd or 3rd guitar, dont pick this one."
2,string break,"I have had this electric guitar for two months right now. I have had to replace four strings since, I bought the best strings around and the right size to put on it and it broke it the first five minutes i had it on and it was rightly tuned and i dont play hard.This guitar is not what it is like on the picture advertised it has a more sharp head and it is dark blue, the amp is different too it is more older and crackles when I play it.The cord that is provided snapped the third day I had it so I had to buy a new one and the strings are bad to put on it.If you fix it up a little bit and put a little money into it you may have a nice guitar, but take my advise."
1,Just not a very good guitar,"I'm a beginner guitar player, but I play other instruments so it was pretty easy for me to see that this guitar wasn't too great. It looks nice enough and the amp works fine, but it the strings don't stay in tune for very long. I suggest going to a guitar shop and spending a little bit more money for a much higher quality instrument. The only real good thing about this guitar is that I was able to sell it!"
1,Junk,"The guitar and/or amp sounded terrible. This was just junk. Fortunately, the company let me return the product for a refund....but, I had to pay the return freight.They sell absolute junk. But, I had no idea this was junk until I received the product. And then I had to pay to return the junk. This just seems inherently wrong to me. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again!Stay away! Do not waste your time and money!"
2,Hunk of Junk,"I wanted to buy this because i wanted to play electric guitar, i know how to play a bit and could self teach it. It was shiney and looked good, but it BUZZED like crazy, i ajusted the action, string height, it still buzzed on the lower string, i looked down the neck to ajust the bolt in it, its off center and i couldnt ajust it, so... i returned it, and are refunded. I guess the customer servis was fine :)"
4,Austin Bazaar Sunburst Electric Guitar/Beginner Kit,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 year-old, and did so in reliance upon the other reviews indicating that this was a perfect ""first try"" set up. It has been great! He likes it, the amp works well, and it's a perfect price for a beginner."
5,"Hard to beat for the price, but remember, this is a cheap set!","You get an inexpensive guitar, usable amp, and some little do-dads. But the price is incredibly good. You can buy this as a first electric guitar for a child and not feel badly about it. If they enjoy it and stick with it, buy something better next year. If they give up on it, put this out in your next garage sale and ask $40 for the set. It's a low investment strategy.Now, advice for the purchase, check it out right away, and if it's genuinely broken (as opposed to being cheap and not especially sturdy) contact the seller right away. Give it a try. Beginners often break strings by overtightening during tuning. Have a friend show you how to tune. Enjoy your simple, but good for the low price, guitar setup."
4,Awsome Deal !,"I just received this guitar and my 11 year is very happy !. Other than a few items missing, guitar strap and extra strings and a paper thin pick this guitar is great !. It's just the right size and weight for my son and very well made. The amp is bigger than I expected and works well. This was definately a good deal considering everthing you get for the price ! A it only took 8 days for delivery. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Nice starter.,"Bought two of these, the other metallic. Other than the color everything I thought was the same but the metallic felt a lot heavier and the whammy bar was so much tighter.I am very happy with the sunburst. Strings don't stay in tune for long, should upgrade on strings. Nice starter."
1,Horrible Merchant Damaged Item,"""Do not buy anything from this seller. My item arrived damaged and Austin Bazaar refused to reimburse my inital and return shipping costs. Amazon A to Z guarantee eventually refunded my shipping costs but not the seller."""
2,Cheap,"Bought this a couple of years ago for my son (age 5 at the time). It's heavy and cheaply made. When he was actually ready for lessons, the instructor couldn't get it to tune correctly. I am not a guitar player, so I cannot describe what was wrong, but something about the bridge and neck that would need some work in order to get it in playing shape. I wound up buying a Fender starter that was more, but so far worth it...."
3,good... not too much,"I received this product.the aplificador never works, I had to send it to repair myself.The guitar is beautiful, good material, the strings of the guitar sound good to be generous. The strings are far apart from the mast.this is very annoying since I get to my damaged amplifier. seems it does not pass through quality control.Do not buy more from this seller."
2,Guitar,"The Strings were too far from the neck, but i didnt really notice it until i played another person's guitar. Now I find it almost impossible to play. I would say if your reading this than i advise for you to get a guitar at a music shop, not the internet because you need to see if you like the feel before you purchase it, and also the sound."
2,amplifier buzzes,"My son who is 14 seems to like the thing, but I find that the amplifier buzzes annoyingly."
5,My son was impressed!,"I'm definately no guitar expert, but when I un-wrapped this guitar it was beautiful! It was also very well packaged so it wouldn't get damaged. The only complaint I have is that the blue on the guitar was different from the one I ordered. I ordered a royal blue color and the one I got was a teal, aqua blue. The aqua blue was still shiny and beautiful but not the color I ordered. My son, who is 11 years old, loved it (and so did his dad). All in all, I'm glad I got it. I also received my order on time. Thanks!"
2,Quality not what expected,"Neck of Guitar is not laquored or stained so the wood feels unfinished and shows blemishes. The faceplate on our unit had scratches or gouges on it and looked as if the material was made with a cheap plastic coating which would continue to peel off after use, sorry I know this is a low end unit but the quality was not what I expected...Probably better off buying a higher end used model"
1,Bad guitar sent !,They sent a damage guitar to my address. There is a little piece broken off in the corner of it. Bad. Bad.
5,finally,"Finally I,ve been looking for the perfect guitar for my son and THIS is the Perfect Guitar!!!!!!!"
4,Laptop Case Only,Pro: The quality is good for the price.Con: There is not enough room to fit your charger.Conclusion: I recommend this case only for transporting your laptop and a few documents.
3,An excellent book for a younger reader,"This book seems to be part of a set for younger readers, say around ten to twelve. Good for what it is but not as comprehensive as I would have liked."
2,Confusing picture,"This harness is confusing. If you go to the amazon site you will see a picture with the shoulder harness and the belt together so I got really confused....I couldn't decide whether to buy the belt or not and guess what I didn't. When I got my order, it's really just the harness......take a look at the picture at amazon.....they show the whole system....this picture should be changed!!!! I give this 2 stars because of the misleading picture from amazon. If you are there planning to get one better get the belt as well."
3,misinformation about product,"The ""additional product information"" area when clicked, describes the three box set accurately except for one important point. The format is listed as ""widescreen"". Unfortunately, the set I received has standard 4:3 aspect ratio for seasons one and two and the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio only for season three.If this is the only combination of formats available, it would be nice to note that in the product description."
2,Great! ..for awhile.,"It worked flawlessly for about 6 months, but now it just keeps ejecting the DVD's over and over. At first it was just once in awhile, now it's all the time. Too bad. I really liked it, but now it is just a cup holder!"
1,Dont buy it,"Its unbelievable what happened. I bought this product because the picture shows a complete solution, with the belt and the shoulder part. But i only received the shoulder part. The belt and the cases didnot come with the product. its unbelievable...."
1,Dead at the Jazzhaus,"I wish I could describe this album elequently enough so that reading this review would be like listening to the music. Sadly, you might just have to hear this album for yourself if your morbid curiousity peaks high enough. This live cd is a manifestation of everything that is wrong with reggae: overzealous, cheesy and too eager to please. No originality makes you feel sad for the state of reggae and makes you cringe that some people have gone out to enjoy this band. We can only hope that the crowd noises are overlaid or just that they are random drunk interjections. If neither of these are the case then abandon all hope if you enter the jazzhaus, for it is the land where musical integrity is thrown out the window."
5,Glue for the soul,"This all-time album finds its way into the musical part of your brain and stays in there like glue, no matter whether you speak Portuguese or not. If you undestand the lirics and watch the multimedia clips, then it goes even deeper in its meaning. This Band's work only gets better with time, as proven by their last masterpiece album, ""A Calma que Precede o Esporo"". Their first and last albums will quickly find a very special place at or near the top of your collection."
3,Third Album of brazilian reggae cool band,"Well, what to say about Rappa? The first CD was a real reggae album, the second, Rappa Mundi, was more pop, has some rock to, including a Jimi Hendrix cover, ""Hey Joe"". But this third album has a little bit of hip hop, and makes that reggae to has a new sensation. Well, this CD is beeing considerated in Brazil one of the bests of the last year, I don't think that this album is so cool like that, but is real demonstration that this band don't like to stop right now."
5,maturity matters,"With this 3rd album(actually called LADO B LADO A)the brazilian band O Rappa shows how much they have grown since their 1st release. With consistent lyrics talking mostly about the social matters of Rio de Janeiro, they have reached an unique music style with creative drum lines and also a very good hip hop dj, as well as the great voice of the lead singer Falco. Not anymore influenced by american and european sounds only, O Rappa has reached their own identity with this new cd, a guarantee of originality and variety - a little of techno (Homem Amarelo), pop and swing (Me Deixa, O Que Sobrou do Céu), a brazilian funk(Todas as Comunidades), and a precious and emotional ballad (Minha Alma). You must check it out."
3,interesting,"I don't know how to put it. It's nice, but not outstanding. I'm happy with their music but there is something missing. There is material, and I would suggest it if you are in search of something different all in one CD. In fact, I find familiar patterns in each song and at the same time original but nothing outbreaking. THere are 3 songs that I would save. But that it's personal."
4,A Look Into Rural Alabama,"An excellent peek into a part of Alabama time has forgotten. Where racial unrest still runs rampid, the author offers a unique perspective by infiltrating Little River's usually unwelcoming community."
2,Space Music This ISN'T,"While a couple of tracks are good, this, for the most part, isn't space music. If Eloy wanted to make some space music, he needed to listen to Jonn Serrie, Meg Bowles, Mark Peterson (Geodesium), Craig Padilla, or Jon Allasia's & David Blonski's ""Saturn Rising"" before hitting the studio. Even a quick listen to some early Kitaro would have helped. But alas we have a CD that ""Music from the Hearts of Space"" wouldn't touch. Like I said, a couple tracks are good, but the rest belong in a disco. Space fans, don't be deceived by the title. Progressive electronica/techno fans, try it!"
4,anh...,"I didn't think it was going to be as short as it was, my fault, plus, I thought the finish was too 90ish, like too cherry red."
4,good reference for Alzheimer's caregivers/family members,I am in my second read of this little book and it is full of helpful ideas about THE VISIT to Alzheimer patients (or anyone with impaired memory.) The author says early on that it is NOT a book to be READ through but rather a book to REFER to when a certain situation arises. I am very glad I bought it so I can have it with me as long as I have my mother with me...
2,Not relevant enough,"This book is basically a ""feel good"" book and doesn't address the grittiness of dementia/alzheimer disease. There are many of us whose loved ones/friends have become extremely hateful and vitriolic, and this book does nothing to give us some glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. ""The 36-hour Day"" is a much better and more comprehensive book."
5,"One of my ""Must"" readings for caregivers","Dementia a disease that knows no boundaries. It is blind to the categories in which we usually place our fellow human beings. It can occur at the age of 55 or 85. It can happen to Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Christians, Muslims, males and females, rich and poor. It has not spared ex-presidents. I speak from personal experience. Dementia did not spare my mother whose 15 year journey into the opaque fog of this disease is told in my own recently published book. Tears are shed by husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters-in fact anyone responsible for the care of a loved one with dementia. TALKING TO ALZHEIMER'S will help all such caregivers to cope.Robert Tell, Author of ""DEMENTIA DIARY, A Care Giver's Journal"""
4,Helpful perspective for difficult times,"My parent has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's. A physician I know recommended this book, and she was right. It is short -- very easy to read small chunks at a time. And it deals not with treatment, or medical issues, but just super helpful ways to relate to a person with Alzheimer's -- ways to make their time as meaningful as possible. It is so hard, on both sides, I am sure. This book provides such important perspective on how it must feel for an adult to suddenly be treated as though they aren't capable. There are things we can do, easy things, to help them keep their identity as an individual, keep their dignity as an important person in your life. I found this book very helpful; I highly recommend it."
3,visiting people with Alzheimer's,"This book would be helpful to people who visit friends, acquaintences in their homes, assisted living facilities,nursing homes and to family who are struggling with how to connect with loved ones in the later stages of the disease. Offers some specific techniques to use as you visit and addresses the visitor's discomfort in difficult situations."
1,I See Satan Fall Like Lightning,"This is the dumbest book I've ever read. Not only is it boring, it's embarrassingly logically flawed. This is just another Christian with an agenda trying to make money by selling things to gullible followers. I'm sorry if you find that offensive but there is no other explanation. And as a student of philosophy I find it highly offensive when theologians call themselves philosophers. No one who cares that what they write is true could ever possibly have written this book. It's just absurd and insulting and not even entertaining. If you can avoid this book, do."
4,Eye Opening,Very intriguing book about the nature of people and of human societies. It is definitely worth it to be aware of Girard's anthropological insights.
1,Stereotypical Mish Mash,"I could not even get all the way through this film because of the poor acting skills of the leads...To begin with the actor who plays David (Eben Gordon) looks twenty six and not sixteen and Rob Morretti (Kenny) is flat and achingly dull in the role as teacher/seducer. So much of the content was stereotypical and almost comedic such as the mom (who is a boozer) who hides her stash in the toilet tank or Kenny putting his hand on David's shoulder and uttering that old cliche ""if you need someone to talk to"" There are so many great gay films out there, however, this is not one of them."
2,related,I bought this because my cousin is in it. I really did not think it was very good. The story line was okay yet the script was awful. Some of the actors were okay others not so much. The cinematography was awful. I just kept in mind that it was low low budget.Would not have purchased except for the connection.
3,Crutch-Director's Cut,The movie itself is based on a true story. The movie does not have closed-captioned and hard for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to understand the main story of the movie. It's hard for me to know what is happening without closed-captioned for hearing impaired.
5,Awesome!,Queen Esther is a great undiscovered talent. I had the privilege of hearing her sing in person and she blew me away! Her high note is amazing and her music is a great blend of traditional hymns and contemporary gospel. I was blessed by her awesome beauty and spirit when I met her and I can't wait for her next album.
5,Beautiful!,I heard about Queen Esther from a friend of mine in Maryland and she is everything I heard she was and more. I got her CD and then I traveled to MD to see her live. She even grabbed the mic annointed! She truly touched my heart. Buy this CD. I guarantee you'll love it!
1,MUST READ B4 PURCHASE,"I too take my xbox around. I had bought this item through a different vendor. When I received the package the case already had a huge dent on its corner. From that I realized that this item was not as durable as it may seem. THe metal is very thin and can split rather easily. That is what happened to mine. I'm writing this review because I've seen alot of excellent reviews on this item and post this comment about its durable as a FYI. If the case itself cannot protect itself how would it protect the XBOX. In terms of alternative cases, you are better off with storing it in its original cardboard box because of the styrophoam. Rather ghetto but I prefer functionality over asthetics."
1,The worst case you can buy,"When i read all the reviews for this case i thought it was a great buy and that fact that it was an ""aluminum"" case caught my eye. When i recieved this case however, i found that i could have built this case for $5. First off the case is cardboard with a plastic type of material around that with some fake ass looking metal flake job. Anyone who buys it and has no problem knowing that this is not an aluminum case than i would have no problem in you wasting your money but, i know that there are people who like to get what they pay for and this my friends is a joke."
3,slow but intriguing,"though marred by its apparent desire to be intellectually stimulating (certain death for many horror films) The Asphyx is saved by an emotional performance from Robert Stephens as Sir Hugo Cunningham, a photographer who has discovered the secret of immortality in 1875. Stephens recites his hokey lines with conviction, and if it weren't for blunt editing, lapses in logic (notice the camera change positions when Sir Hugo watches a film of Clive's death), and its snotty british desire for respectability, this movie would surely have a prominent place in the pantheon of great 70's horror films. if you prefer Hammer to AIP than you just might enjoy this throwback to the early days of Quatermass and Baron Frankenstein, but if you like your horror with a lot of action and ""sobaditsfunny""ness then the only thing here for you is probably the cheesy puppet used to portray the title creature. overall, an entertainingly adequate flawed cult classic."
5,Love the movie,"My husband has been wanting this movie for awhile, so I checked out amazon and there it was. Great movie at a great price I will continue purchasing from amazon."
3,A new policy I will follow,"Any film on DVD that the makers choose to neither subtitle or offer closed captions, I will not rate above a 3, no matter how good the film is. To refuse to recognize the existence of deaf, hard of hearing and just people of an older age is without defense. Indeed I consider it a direct and mean-full offence. They have decided the film is not worth the cost of subtitles or closed captions although it is not expensive at all in the realm of normal production expenses. I support an amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act requiring all films publicly releases in the US to have one or the other."
2,Not Anamorphic?,"Was disappointed with this DVD - I've waited a long time for this movie to make it to DVD - the movie itself is cool, but Hen's Tooth DVD's not anamorphic, and on my tv is played as a small image in the middle of the screen."
2,It's great.....until,"It works fine....until the day you wake up to find that it has crashed on you, and all your stats and saves are down the toilet"
1,sucks,"this thing seems like a dream-i owned one for a year and it worked perfectly, with 16MB of memory on the expansion itself. it has an expansion bay to plug in your smaller 8MB memory card, and there is a button on top you use to toggle between the two. to clarify the confusion, THERE IS NO DISC NEEDED TO LOAD THIS MEMORY CARD OR TO PLAY WITH IT. i used it fine for a year until....one day i was saving my dynasty in March Madness 2004 and the expansion corrupted. it does this without warning, and all of the files on the card become corrupted, which means unable to save/load and unable to be deleted from the card. so it becomes totally worthless. this thing is really bad, and i lost thousands of saved files because of it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE BY INTEC, get the 16MB memory cards WITHOUT THE EXPANSION. consider yourselves warned.."
2,"good, 'till you sell it","ok, a long time ago, I picked one of these up. it came with no disk. not so long ago, while trying to get cash for something, I sold it along with some games. little did I know that I had just sold off all my GT4 data. I am not sure if it compresses the file or just has a itty bitty memory card inside of it, but regardless, I can't acess the GT4 file. 2+ months of grueling gaming down the drain. word of warning: if you get this and use it with games, make sure you do not sell it until you sell the games you used it with! if you do, you'll almost certainly loose your data unless you find another one, and if it only adds to the storage with another memory card, then you're out of luck!"
1,Intec NEVER seems to work,"I got this about a year ago from my mom, she figured to save money on buying memory cards she would give me this. Well, I could never get it to work. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong. So I kept it in but I only used my original 8MB memory card. I couldn't access the expansion. Everytime I tried the PS2 would say it needed to be formatted. When I hit ""yes"" It would say that the formatting failed. I thought that maybe I was doing somethign wrong. However, after checking out HUNDREDS of reviews and forums I found out that 12 out of 14 people are having the same problem (or something similar) and that it's happened on INTEC expansions for all 3 major consoles.I say your better off buying memory cards because INTEC doesn't seem to work...I say stick with the Sony stuff."
1,no memery,"OK, if you loose the disk, your sqrewed, not to mention loading the stupid thing every time you change a game... and who takes the time to ""crush"" a file after playing... it works till you loose the disk, and it wont work on ""Medal of Honor: Frontline"""
5,We read it again and agaain,"We enjoyed this book as part of our Volume 1 Five In A Row Curriculum. We appreciated the pictures and the story. The phrase ""The very last first time,"" is now a part of our family."
3,FIRST TRY,I THINK MR ROBERTS IS A GOOD STORY TELLER. THE BOOK GIVES INSIGHT TO WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE IS. I GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING ABLE TO PUT INTO WORDS HOW HIS LIFE HAS BEEN.
3,OK,"pro: invaluable angle attachment for screwdriving (probably too weak for most drilling, light weightcon: light weight power as well and a bit pricey for just once in a while angle driving and as an extra power screwdriver"
1,waste of money,bought one at rockler for half list price. (about 80$) Waste of money. If I had paid full price I would be much more upset. I also have ryobi lion I bought for less than 30 dollars. Works just as well. I use both for putting screws into red oak with pilot holes.
1,100 sci fi movies,"one disk was okay, the other disk i have the movies on another disk. I thought it was new movies but it was two sets put together that have been on sale for some time. It is too expensive to send back and i am disabled and cannot get to the post office easily. I'll probably give it as a gift and learn to watch and buy more carefully. thank you, sherida matzat"
3,Pretty Not Meaty,"Mr. Matyszak's Chronicle of the Roman Republic is a coffee table style book beautifully illustrated on nice heavy glossy paper. The book is comprised of biographical sketches of all the leading figures of the Republic presented in chronological order. The author presents a nice introduction to the Republic but this presentation style doesn't allow for a clear flow of the course of events as often more than one figure participates. Thus, specific events are occulted as the role of major figures is gleaned only through the course of dozens of pages. With no uniform image emerging the reader is left without much of a big picture understanding - events come and go with little connection from one to the other. Also the clipped writing style with occasional dangling modifiers doesn't help bring events to life. The author seems eager to tell his tale, but falls short."
5,Excellent reference.,"This is a fine reference and overview of the history of the Roman Republic; it does not provide great detail on any specific era, but it provides sufficient information to satisfy a non-specialist like me. It may or may not be of any value to someone seeking to explore the subject in depth; I wouldn't know. But as a beginner's overview, it's wonderful."
1,turned me off,I was looking through this book at Borders and I came across a statement that bothered me. The author says (actually quotes another author saying) something along the lines that Caesar's exploits in Gaul resulted in a level of carnage and destruction not seen again until the Europeans settled in the Americas. I don't know how much more such anti-American garbage this book contains (for I put it back on the shelve after reading that) but that was enough to make me look elsewhere for material on the Roman Republic.
1,Do NOT order from this company,"I recently placed an order with this company directly from the company website. My basket arrived without ANY information on whom it was from. I typed a beautiful message on the gift message and included my name. The recipient actually had to call The Fruit Company to find out for herself, one day POST-OP!! I called the company to express my displeasure. They were aware of this type of problem, about gift messages not being submitted with the order, and the only way they could offer to rectify was to offer me a $2.60 customer credit!!! I ordered $70 basket!!! The woman I spoke with said there was nothing she could do. I just checked their website and it says 100 percent satisfaction, guaranteed.Well they surely don't stand by that! Very poor customer service!! Needless to say, I will be placing future orders for gift baskets elsewhere!D. Martin"
5,"Hard to find 2"" & ionic combo.LOVE IT!! (--) lead in the cord!! Why? Wear gloves during use.","Hard to find 2"" & ionic combo. My hair is naturally wavy, frizzy, & dry. This iron makes my hair look better than EVER before. Use with caution, gets VERY HOT. Noticed the Made in China tag and LEAD in the cord!! Why would there be lead in this product? I wear gloves during use.Now if I could just find ionic 1 3/4"" hot rollers!!"
5,Aluminum Case,Wow this is and awesome case. It holds everything that I need and it has a nice lock. I would suggest getting this case above all others.
4,Great Product!!!,"This game case does not look like much at first but wait until you try it. This case holds my 4 Gamecube controllers, the Gamecube, The cables and either my monitor or my Game boy player (depends what I want), I have a game case that holds 10 games I bought at Toys R Us. I slip that into one of the pockets and I am ready to go. There is a number combo on it so be careful and do not forget it. This is just very helpful. It makes travel great."
3,charleyc,"This is a great idea, but if you plan on using it in a car be prepared for frequent skips and noise. Having said that, it reads CD-RW MP-3 disks without any other problems. You can set it to play random selections and enjoy your favorite music all day long without having to change CD's."
2,Weak navigation and poor CDR reading,"This unit has only a two line LED dislplay. One of the lines is constantly displaying the current folder number, track number, and time, leaving only one line for navigation and displaying artist, album, and track. Navigating the folders is very clumsy and the limited characters per line can make finding a track by name difficult. The scrolling of the ID3 info on the one line is slow and hard to read at times. This unit also has trouble reading several types of CDRs. It was able to read Kodak Golds fine, but the blue Imation CDRs were unreadable by the MP3 player, but could be read fine by a PC. Overall I suggest finding a unit with a larger LCD display and better capabilities of reading all brands of CDRs. The one positive I find about this unit is the included extras. An AC adapter, a DC car adapter, a cassette adapter, and headphones."
3,skipping or pausing,"it dosnt skip it pauses i shook it bounced it and droped it from about an inch high that didnt effect it,but just let it sit there playing and it just stops for a few seconds then continues and it wont play a whole cd of mp3 without shuting off or requireing me to push next, another guy said his had no problem he was using somthing called vbr format what is that? i use ez cd creator softwear"
4,Memorex MPD8505CP Portable MP3/CD Player with 45 Second,"Kind of pricey, now have to wait for months for my monthly allowances to build-up. Avg. sound quality. Only gripe is that it plays up to 192kbps. Wish it would play beyond 192 kbps i.e. No AM or FM tuner built in. No Ni-MH battery, had to ask to buy some, Ni-MH extends play time, and cheaper than buying alkaline batteries over time. Sound quality is above average. Need easier way to search or browse through directories or a more user friendly menu...."
1,broken after 2 months,"this was a great cd/mp3 player....for about 65 days. I used it very lightly-about 20 minutes a day walking to class, then all of a sudden it won't recognize cds, it always says ""no disc."" beware of this because amazon won't take exchanges or returns after 30 days, and now I'm out 50 bucks."
3,Skips,I liked everything about it with the exception of skipping in the car. It has to go back and now I see that they have raised the price so I'll wait for another brand to surface.
3,Needs more work back at that lab,First off I could not find the product in stores or online. It was almost like they could not make them fast enough.I finally ordered it online and was so excited to have it I requested next day delivery.Problem #1: The lighter interface is bulky and would not fit my ford ranger ash tray. I had to buy a special adapter.Problem #2: As promised above every 15 or so minutes you get a empty pause. I can almost live with this since I'm more interested in quantity over quality.Problem #3: If I burn a cdr and then attempt to tack on more mp3 files these files (apparently) can't be read by the player.Problem #4: I have been unable to get it to read cd-rw cds. It spins and spins and finally says error. If I can't resolve this I will return the product.I'm running a Pacific Digital Corp mitsumi cr-4802te with NTI pro 3.5.8 software. Newer CD readers have no problems reading my CDRWs.
4,Memorex MPD8505CP: How to fix skipping problems,"Okay, After toasting nearly 10 discs, reading all the message boards, and trying many different writing modes and speeds, here's the way to geet around skipping problems:1. Make sure your CD is written in ISO9660 format with 30-char long filenames as and option. 2. Make sure your CD writing mode is CD-ROM (Mode I)and NOT CDROM-XA mode (Mode II). 3. Use no greater than 128-bit MP3's.The key is in the way your burn your CD, not the MP3 encoder you use.That's it!-gpg"
4,Great unit with some flaws,"For the price that I got (under $40) it was a very nice unit. I've had the unit for over six months now and so far, only some skipping occur, but not much at all. The skippings usually seem quite random, and doesn't happen because th eunit is being moved or anything like that. The unit I have contians the suffix A sticker.The car kit that came with mine, though, is a little weird. At times the volume will be too soft for no reason, but mostly they all worked great.The only things I really don't like about this unit are 1) the display LCD isn't backlit, making reading practically impossible at night, and 2) the search option is not very user friendly, and the unit doesn't seem to respond too well to it.Over all, I give it 4 stars, for its price, and that it hadn't died on me yet."
1,"Audio cd file yes, mp3 no","This unit skips mp3's in various places. However, if you convert the same mp3 to a normal audio cd file it plays fine.This was tested on numerous mp3 files.Wish I could keep it but it defeats the purpose of a mp3 cd player if it skips mp3's."
5,Awesome! No skips for lower bit rates,"I had been looking for a long time for something better (read as cheaper) than the AIWA indash mp3 player. it is truly awesome.Had some nervous times at the beginning when I got skipping in the songs..but then I reburned the CD and found that the skipping went away (try 1X or 2X burning). Also, found that the higher the bit rate, the more it will skip because it has more data to process in the given 45 second antishock. Keep it at 128K like the manual says and you won't have problems.Haven't tried the player with a regular audio CD yet, but hey, who needs to - 200 songs on a single CD is good enough for me.Buy it! Its the best buy your going to find in MP3s for at least a 16 months!"
2,Volt-envy,"You'd be out of your head to buy this half-rate pretender. I had it, returned and just got the Sonic Blue Riovolt. A far superior product. I'd venture to say it 4x as good as this thing and only thirty bucks more. I give Memorex credit for getting it out to market quick but now it must bow in. Amazon should have volt soon go to cnet to see who has it now."
3,Cheap in price and cheap on key features,"This is a fairly decent player. The interface is okay and it does what it is supposed to for the most part. While the player does handle ID3 tags (something other players lack), it fails to properly play VBR and does not support multi-session discs. These two glaring flaws kill it in mybook....One other feature which I would love to see and I'm not sure if any player supports it is volume normalization. It is aggravating to have different level tracks and have to fumble with the volume."
1,Not Worth it!,"Definataly not worth the money! It skips, eats batteries, hard to configure, waste of time. Don' Buy it!"
1,No lo compre (Desde Colombia),"Este producto realmente es una pena. Yo lo he adquirido a través de fiera.com - Colombia y posee tres grandes defectos:- Solo lee 200 canciones por cd- No acepta cd's multisesión- Crea clicks y pops en las canciones de manera aleatoria haciendolas realmente indeseables en las fiestas por ejemploEstoy pensando en comprar un nuevo reproductor mp3 pero desafortunadamente en el mercado colombiano no hay muchas opciones. En otras revisiones dice que memorex ha sacado una version actualizada, la mpd8507cp, pero no tengo el dinero para comprar esta actualización. Por ahora me conformaré con tener canciones que saltan aleatoriamente cuando se reproducen, y comprar cd-rw's para quemar las canciones una y otra vez en una sola sesión."
3,Anti-shock,There was no mentioned on :01) What is the anti-shock per second for the CD02) What is the Anti-shock per second for the MP303) any manual ?
4,Al fin!!,Al fin lo tengo en mis manos. Lo que esperé tanto tiempo... Poder sacar mis mp3 de la computadora y llevarlos conmigo a todos lados. Puedo armar listas de mp3 de hasta 24 temas... y lo mejor es que puedo escucharlos con sólo dos pilas chicas durante 10 hs. seguidas. Es muy práctico y a un precio más que conveniente. Viene con un enchufe para conectar a la pared y con el adaptador para el coche. No más llevar cassettes y cassettes en los viajes... dos CD y a manejar por las rutas de donde sea!
3,"Good, yet not-so-good","Since this was my first MP3 CD player, I accepted it, but had I known more about MP3 CD players perhaps things would have been different. Nowhere does it say that there is a 200 song limit per CD. Unless the CDRs are burnt carefully, according to what Memorex thinks best (again, available only from reviews and not from the manual), tracks will skip, and often stop playing in the middle.The sound quality is very good, though, and no problems were encountered when playing audio CDs."
1,if you buy this product keep the receipt,mine puttered out only hours after recieving it. The design is very lacking and their are many better products that do the same thing or even more. Truely a low end dissapointment.
4,Details On Unit,"I myself wanted to know more about the product, so I emailed memorex and they sent me the specs for it. I have one now and am happy with it. It does not have the 2-3 sec delay between songs and Batteries last approx. 4-5 hours."
1,Disappointing Memorex player,"I bought this player last year at Target. I soon realized that it will not play a lot of the MP3 files. It will not play any VBR encoded files. It will not play bit rates about about 192 kbp3 or below 64 kbps in most cases. The player will skip and stammer all the way through these tracks. DOn't waste your money. You can get something better for very little more. Hard to find specifications on these portable players. Let the buyer beware!Also, after 6 months it quit working altogether, apparently due to heat exposure inside an automobile.I was very disappointed!I should have returned this piece of junk while it was still under warranty."
3,Not so durable,"I purchased my first Memorex MP3-CD player about a year ago. It lasted about 100 days and then it stopped recognizing the cd. I contacted Memorex and they replaced my CD-player with a new one. A year later I am starting to run into the same problems. Otherwise, the CD player was OK."
2,Simply OK,"It is nice to have lots of music to listen to- so much music in fact that my batteries usually wear out before the cd is done.But I've yet to have a listening experience in which the player doesn't skip. The player skips A LOT. If it was just once and a while I could over look it, but it is more like every other song, and frequently several times during one song. This gets irritating quickly. I'm spending more money next time and getting something decent."
3,Cheap but not worth it!,"A cheap MP3 Player with CAR care Kit, Plays MP3s and Standard CDs, but Skips a lot while Playing MP3s, Did not use it for Standard CDs yet. Its worth spending a little more to buy a better one if you love uninterrupted music."
3,dissapointed,"I got this for a christmas present and it was awsome!for the first 6 months and then it totally stoped working and by then i coulden't return it! it is under my bed collecting dust. i'm never getting a Memorex cd player again!!!If your thinking of getting a MP3/CD player, Don't get one, i would recomend that u look into minidisk players (much more reliable)"
2,Had higher expectations of product,"Despite the fact that this CD player comes with a car kit, and is explicitly labeled with a 45-second anti-skip protection, its performance is very poor in a moving car. Even on a smooth road, songs which play perfectly off the unit under other conditions skip and pop too often to make listening to music with it an enjoyable experience.The button layout isn't terribly ackward, but the subtlties of using this CD player make it a poor device. MP3 files with names longer than 32 characters are completely ignored, directory names are ignored, and the search function is extremely poor."
1,Bad design,"The player includes a spring box inside that is causing friction against my CDs and as a result they skip a lot or just completely halt. The anti-skip does not live up to the 45 second expectations. Not recomended, I wish I could return it."
1,Cheap Price = Cheap Product,"I could not beleive how poor this product performs. It doesn't support CDs larger than 640Mb, no VBR, no >128Kbps, it also doesn't play other files for no apparrent reason, cropped filenames (also the ID3 tags scroll by way too slowly and there is no way to speed it up), no backlight, the resume doesn't work, the ESP doesn't do anything, no support for firmware upgrades, one of the worst interfaces i've ever seen, and very cheap construction. I STRONGLY urge you not to buy this MP3/CD player, but if you want to pay use the car kit thats included then go ahead. I've emailed memorex about these problems but after 3 weeks i have yet to get a response back."
3,A confusing gadget,"I bought this because I wanted a MP3 player with my CD Player. It came with a lot of accessories and I thought it would be quality due to the expensive price. Boy was I wrong. Once I got this thing, my first problem was confusion. How do I work this and how do I work that? The instructions didn't really help. My second problem was that the CD Player often got ""confused"". I would push a button telling it to do something and it would do something completely different. To sum this up, you can buy this if you want, but it's quite confusing. Maybe they'll re-do it and get some of the bugs out. But remember, high prices don't always mean quality."
4,From bad to great,"Read this Review for your own good!! This mp3 cd player periodically skips on any mp3's above 128 kbps bitrate. It will also periodically skip every 10 seconds if there is a mixed bitrate on the cd for example some of your mp3's are 128, and some are 96, and some are 64 bitrates. So All i have on my cds are 128 bitrate encoded and it works perfect without skipping till about 20 minutes, (which i think is because one of my cds is scratched up). So if you have music with different bit rates, do not buy this product. I recommend 128 kbps because it is the highest bitrate this cd player can handle and if all your songs are this bitrate, this product will suit you. Otherwise you are in for a lot of messed up music quality. All music is great under same bit rate (on one cd) and a bit rate 128 kbps or lower. It also Does not take multisession cds but this does not change my opinion on the product cause it reads my cdrw's fine!"
2,Aggravating,"Whoever built this rushed to get it out because it doesn't look like they tested it to see if it works as they say it does.Sound is good although it doesn't read all MP3 files, stops playing and shuts off by itself, random play feature is not very random, skips like crazy which is very aggravating and dangerous while driving. Makes me want to throw it out the window. Prospective buyers might want to wait untill they come out with a better tested unit."
1,Not a pleasing experience,"I was very unhappy with this product for the followig reasons:The anti shock protection was very weak, specially when playing regular music CDs (as opposed to MP3 CDs).The unit froze up and stopped working after only 2 hours of use. During the time it did work it proved itself to be a rather bulky, non user-friendly unit.I do not recommend this player."
4,Good Value,"Hi, I purchased this player after a lot of research and reading the reviews. In a couple of words- buy it. I have been listening to a lot of MP3 files on it for several weeks. I had it up and playing out of the box in about 5 minutes. Don't let the reviews about hard to program buttons scare you. Just take one thing at a time. It sounds very good and comes with more accessories than other brands for the price. I'd definately buy it again. Jim R."
1,Not so good after all...,"(note: I'm on my second one, I exchanged it after a while) It played good at first, but then dropped off real fast. The MP3 feature would sometimes blow a big high pitched skip sound, which is very disturbing. Now it skips a lot. Both MP3 CDs and Audio CDs. Plus, when is skips with the ""ESP"" on, it causes it to halt for a about 20 seconds. Sometimes it will halt, and never come back.I work with MP3 often, and honestly, I don't think this MP3 CD technology is very good. I can listen to a song on an MP3 CD, and then listen to the song on an Audio CD, and the MP3 version sounds really muffled. This isn't so listening on a computer.Maybe another would be better, but I'd suggest staying away from MP3 CD players for a few years."
3,spend the extra money!,"Unlike typical portable cd players, we have now entered the age of MP3 Cd players. Accommodating standard CDs as well as CD-Rs or CD-RWs brimming with MP3 or .WAV audio files, the Memorex MPD8505CP MP3-CD player packs high technology into a low-lying music player, giving you beck-and-call access to literally hours of music from a single MP3-encoded CD. But there are other varieties in this new genre of portable cd player technology. I own the RIO VOLT, and i find it much more useful, and of better quality. This product is very bulky, awkward, and the buttons are in a bad design. As well, the headphone jack does make a hissing noise if listened to closely, like the editorial review says. I say, spend the extra money! Yes, this player does offer a 45 second anti skip and this new feature of playing mp3s, but so does a whole range of other cd players. SKIP IT!"
3,"Good Sound, Good Skip Protection, Bad Construction","I bought this player because I thought I was getting a good deal. I was surprised at how good it sounded in my car. It was much better than the CD Changer/Stereo combo my Lexus comes with. It just sounded a lot better and louder. I was real happy with the skip protection too. It hardly ever skipped. If I remember correctly, It only skipped twice after 10+ listening hours in my car. Which I could probably attribute to a dirty CD.I burned my CD's following the instructions given on this thread for recording with Nero. It made a big difference. My old MP3 cds skipped a lot because I had not recorded them this way.Anyway, After enjoying my player for 3 days or so, the stupid thing stopped working. It wasn't very well constructed. It felt very fragile. It might have been the summer heat. Still, the player is good but not very well made in my opinion.Michael."
1,Memorex MPD8505CP Portable MP3-CD Player,"Don't buy this unit. The claimed anti-skip feature doesn't work, whether you're sitting on your couch or driving in your car. The unit is also flimsy and cheaply put together. Memorex claims to have fixed the anti-skip problems in units manufactured after December 2000. Not so. I purchased mine from Amazon in June 2001, so even the units they're sending out right now haven't improved. Memorex has some work to do on improving this product."
4,Whoa!,"One word Whoa! This CD player is just great, though it is a lil bulky comapierd to what im used to.(but that is b/c all I used before was sonys and they are smaller then most)This is a a great buy with a few minor flaws. It takes a while for each CD to load up, and it skips once in a while when playing MP3s.(this only happens with Higher bit rates i.e. 160<) Other then that I have had no probs with it."
4,A Nice MP3 Player For the Money,"The button controls aren't very intuitive - but it's played every MP3 CD I've tried in it. Pay attention to the instructions - single-session CDs ONLY, avoid long file names, make sure there are ONLY .mp3 extension files on the disc. For the cost, this is a good-value player - more so since it comes with an AC adapter and two adapters for vehicle use - cigarette lighter and cassette. With the bass-boost feature turned on, or with a good quality pair of headphones, the sound quality is very good."
3,What's en Vogue?,"I always respected the bands that keep their own style, no matter what the current trends are. But - my opinion - Running Wild is definitely overdoing this. Settling to one style in the late eighties, the band is doing virtually the same music with just little variations. You can make a random mix of tracks from random albums starting from ""Port Royal"", and it will sound just like another album. Boring! Besides, keeping your own originality doesn't mean doing the same over and over again for decades, and I can say here: Rolf, it's time for something fresh! I'm sure that by that I express the opinion of many metalhearts, that are also fans of Running Wild.Rogues might be in Vogue, but limiting stubbornness is not."
2,For Real...,"This would have been a book better left in French. I have been a student of metaphysics for over 25 years and this book is just too unnecessarily difficult. I don't know if it is a bad translation, the author is full of himself or I am upset that it was required reading for a Master's level Communications class on Content Distribution and the professor still has not made a connect to the book and the outcome of the class. There are many other books that explain this concept in simplier terms. The concept is excellent and I agree with much of what he said, but it was just too complicated to get to the bottom line. I gave it two starts because maybe it is more readable in French."
3,"Tough, But Fascinating","This is a tough read, but the philosophy behind it is brilliant. It says so much about how brains process information and form cognitive thought for greater reasoning."
2,Good ideas regurgitated poorly from better thinkers,"I read part of the first half back in college. Going through it again I find myself having the same reservations, Baudrillard's style is overly dependent on these really repetitive, almost cheekily nihilistic assertions. And while his in-your-face style is provocative, ultimately, it just amounts to an aweful lot of empty rhetoric about how totally empty everything is. A lot of it just seems like stuff he read and regurgitated from Deleuze and Foucault and then mixed up with his own sense of cheap posturing. Also, the second half feels incredibly dated with its cheap analysis of late cold-war tensions and half-assed attempts to synthesize a 4th grade level understanding of genetics and emerging cybernetic jargon into his broader system of thought, or anti-system of thought, or whatever it is he thinks he's doing here. If your going to read it, take it with an especially big grain of salt."
5,excellent music,"Catchy swinging latin jazz, it may be the best of Joseph's 3 albums. I recommend them all."
1,OK.,"I liked the story and the actors performance but I was dissaponted because it said it has english subtitles and it didn't, plus the audio wasn't the best either. Perhaps choosing from another seller."
5,Beautiful lesson,My husband and I both saw this as children and started a conversation about it recently. I ordered it for him as a little suprise and we watched it together.We both love this movie and the message it has. Get your tissue out!!!
5,Perfect Kitty Condo,"We are very happy with our purchase of this kitty condo. We took a gamble on this seeing as how our cat is very picky and this was something new. She LOVES it!! It is solid, sturdy and has lots of space for her to lay down, curl up, and scratch. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something a little different."
3,Not for tall Adult cats,This Kitty Condo arrived just as it appears in the picture. My only problem is that it does not have enough weight to it to stay put when my adult cats reach up and try to scratch on the posts. The condo will move and has almost tipped over on my cat a few times. Otherwise it is a great product.
4,size,"The product is great. The price seemed good but then it turned out to be a smaller size than at the local store, that is why it was less expensive"
5,Such a fast response.,"Excellent. I had purchased my previous cartridge from this company. When I needed another this company didn't come up on Amazon.com as one of the top choices. So, I dug deep within Amazon.com to look for it. And there it was. Glad I did because I got an immediate response. Arrived home the next day and there it was on my porch. If I had purchased from another I might still be out of ink and waiting."
2,"100% full toner, BUT...","Although this cartridge initially worked perfectly in my LaserJet 4050N,showing 100% toner capacity, after only TWO MONTHS one of its rollers startedmaking grey vertical streaks on all my documents, showing that the cartridgehad merely been filled, and not otherwise serviced at all. Waste of money."
3,Good - but a shadow of the original band,"Brush the Green rocks and there's some good tunes to be found here, but frankly I prefer the original iteration of the band. Search Amazon for ""Magician of the Bayou"" or ""Sun Tea"" from Saturated Fat... the songs and vocals were better before the drummer took over the reins of the group. The earlier albums are more ambitious and diverse, with more melodic songwriting (though the production and playing on this album is a lot tighter, if that's your thing)."
2,Less Than Perfect,"This will no doubt be a minority opinion. My respect and admiration for Anna Quindlen's body of work knows no bounds. But whose inspiration was it to publish these thousand or so words as a midget book? Did she, or some editor, really think the basic premise -- that perfection cannot be attained -- so original and profound that it merits this treatment? Sorry to say, it does not. It would make a nice commencement address (and apparently it once did), and a very nice newspaper or magazine column. And that's about it. The point has already been made, by many others, often with much greater eloquence. That doesn't detract from its basic validity, of course, but there is no reason to spend good money to read it here. Check it out from your local library. Or don't even bother -- read it at the shelf. The entire microvolume takes less time to get through than do most dust jackets."
1,Felt cheated,I felt cheated after the 15 minutes it took me to read this book on my Kindle. This is too expensive for not much content. A BIG disappointment
2,I feel cheated!,"I paid for a book, and what I got was a short article with a lot of old-fashioned black and white pictures. I expected a lot more substance and a lot more material. I finished the ""book"" in 15 minutes, and will give it to a friend. This is like one of those little gift items you find at the Hallmark store -- not a ""real"" book. What is there is wonderful, but if you pay full price expect to be disappointed."
1,Fluff and poor philosophy,"What a disappointment! Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book. Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins. Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning). Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified. Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate ""Pefection"" with ""Conformity"" and condemning it as inauthentic. I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being ""boring"". Unfortunately, to claim that ""[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen"" just doesn't follow. This is not deep reading. 20 minutes? Don't waste your time."
3,Disappointing,I was disappointed by this book. As a woman who just turned 60 I anxiously awaited her book. It was written by a woman of privilege who is disconnected with her former passion for telling a story.
3,Being so-so,I've read some of Anna's other books and I found them stronger. This one employs too many photographs and it left me wondering what the message was after a while. Her message of self realization and acceptance is driven effectively but not as well as in past books
2,Not a book,"This is an essay in book's clothing. I'm glad that I didn't pay full price for it, and it took me about 15 minutes to read. I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews that stated this, as I would have saved myself the money. Disappointing since I love her writing."
3,Something to think about,"I read this book at a time when I was struggling with setting near perfect standards for myself and putting myself under emense pressure to meet them. Mostly,I was trying to please other people. This book helped me to put life into perspective abit more. Life balance is the key. Worth a read if you too are a perfectionist."
1,"awful, weak, shoddy","Had these speakers for five years until the pot on the volume control got flaky, so I ordered a new one. Same exact model number, same exact design.It was horrible. I can't believe it put out five watts at full blast, while the old one could fill up the room. The sub was MUCH weaker, too. The volume knob stuck about 1/3 of the way up, and I had to really turn it hard to get it to go all the way. HUGE ""wall wart"" power supply, too.Someone standing next to my desk speaking in a conversational tone drowned out this ""premium sound system"" when it was at full volume. Pathetic."
2,eh,"o.k..the first set I had worked pretty well...for 1 day. I returned them and got a new set, which sound so-so, but the highs sound ""tinny"" and vibrate too much. the only way to stop this is to turn them down to a point I can barely hear. I won't buy anything GE again except light bulbs, if that!!"
5,"A Thrilling, Epic Score!","Jerry Goldsmith's music for ""The Edge"" is a masterpiece of grand dimensions in sound and power. The music flows with the images and action. I loved this music for the feeling, for the edge. Goldsmith's music appears to sweep along with the plane through great forest vistas in the beginning of the film. We hear some great drum beats as Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin run away from a vicious bear. The feeling of the music is grand, exciting, and is action-packed by itself! This is great music to appreciate and cherish."
3,A very enjoyable theme,"I bought this CD after becoming hooked on the beautiful theme (""Lost in the Wild"") -- the sound clip of this track gives a good sample of it. Unfortunately, the rest of the music is not quite so nice to listen to... It's a whole bunch of chasing music that isn't a great listen, in my opinion. The album closes with a jazzy (""The Russia House"" style) arrangement of the main theme.This is one of those CDs that I listen to for only one or two tracks (tracks 1 and 10)."
1,Missing parts,"The illustration of this product shows 4 pouches and a belt. These items were not included in the shipment. I have tried to find a way to get this resolved with the seller Amazon.com, LLC but the only options are to ask for a refund or exchange. I cannot figure out how to ask why the shipment was not as shown on the screen. The vest harness part seems to be well made (what there is of it). My rating of one star is not because of the quality of the product but for the way it is presented and for the lack of flexibility in communicating with the seller. If someone from Amazon.com, LLC reads this I would appreciate a response. Thank you.p.s. My other transactions (purchases and sales) through Amazon have been quite satisfactory."
3,"Convenient, comfortable and short",I purchased this to allow me easy access to lenses and such on photo trips. It is very comfortable and well made. The only draw back for me is its length. It is too short for my tastes. I am 6' 3'' and wish this was 4 to 6 inches longer and I have the straps let out all the way.
5,Gary stars with the Fleetwoods,An excellent CD. They can actually sing and you can understand what they're saying.....Good job guys.
5,Hard to Find,"Purchased this for my dad. He seems to like it. We couldn't find it in CD stores, but Amazon came to the rescue."
4,A Taste of the Past,Great compilation of old hits by a group most people have not heard of. Having a husband who grew up in this era I have come to appreciate the music of this time period and was happy to add it to our collection of cds.
4,Fleetwoods Review,"Pryor to this purchase of the Fleetwoods, I was looking for a different CD that was no longer availabe. Amazon.com was very professional about the whole process. I would definetly purchase from them again."
3,"mellow, adding suspense. The operatic tone adds to suspense","Although the songs selected for this score are by nature, melachony, I wasn't sure if I were listening to a score for a suspense thriller or The Phantom of the Opera"
3,It works...,"It works properly, it doesn't mess up the graphics or sound, But it is a pain! it sort of makes a mess of the wires because they are on each side of the box, even in the front with the buttons. I also had to connect it to my RF modulator because it doesn't hook up to cable, so make sure that your TV takes AV cables in the back! mine does not!But it sure is easier to just press a button ;)"
1,West Point should probably be closed,Evidently Lucian was beat about the head by young republicans as a child. The only thing approaching a surprise in this book is what our hero is going to have for dinner. I haven't seen such loving detail of recipes since Hannible. My suggestion to Lucian is to have something to eat before sitting down to write.
5,"Excellent Book, definetly recommend!","This is a very enjoyable book to read! As a girlfriend of a West Point Grad, I can easily relate to many of the ""ways of life"" of a cadet. Truscott writes so that you can follow through the story with them. I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys a fast paced, well written, as well as intriguing time in the life a USMA cadet!"
4,Good reading,I thought that everything came together in this story. I had an inkling from some of the comments that the author does not vote Republican. I do not give a hoot what the characters in the story had to eat.
2,Poorly written. Where was the editor?,Is the Sup a three or five year term? The author can't get that right within the space of a few pages.Did Army play Washington or Washington State? Big difference.What was that confusing time and distance sequence with the state patrol about?I'm told there are many errors on the medicine.Cartoon characters. Evil Republicans and patriotic Democrats. Including the President. Republicans engaged in sex crimes and lying about it. Sound familar?Thank goodness the author is no longer in the Army. We would have lost the Gulf War if his sloppiness was at work in the real world.
1,Predictable and Polemical,"In Lucian Truscott's world, women are heroic and men are weak and flawed (except our hero Ry Slaight and, interestingly, non-front-lines Army types like pathologists and lawyers). Men who oppose political correctness or question placing women in combat are, ipso facto, sexist/racist/homophobic hypocrites, and probably rapists and murderers too. No doubt it makes life easier to see things this way, but it doesn't leave room for a well-crafted novel. (For example, feel free to skip over Chapter 21 entirely. It's an anti-Republican screed that adds almost nothing to the storyline.)Truscott's background and experience allow him to create a vivid atmospheric portrait of the federal academy setting. However, the statues on the Plain are more three-dimensional than the characters in this novel. For a responsible (non-fiction) balance to Truscott's political agenda, I recommend 'The Kinder, Gentler Military' by Stephanie Gutmann (Scribner, 2000)."
1,Simple-minded propaganda.,"Andrew Rogers' review (see below) is dead-on. I give this book 4 stars for excellent insights into West Point traditions and history, then subtract 3 stars for the blatant propaganda in favor of women in combat. Truscott's thesis is simple: West Point is better than it used to be, not in spite of the presence of female cadets -- but BECAUSE of it. Why, it'll be even better when the Commandant and Superintendent are women, not to mention all the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Why? Don't ask, just believe it. Mr. Rogers is right: skip this fiction and read the facts in Stephanie Guttman's book."
2,Had potential but fell short of expectations,"The plot is imaginative enough, but Truscott just didn't write a good enough story to go with it. He should of kept his politics to a bare minimum and focused on developing a more exciting and interesting story instead. If you want to read a good mystery novel, try one by Stephen Frey or Linda Fairstein."
4,Outstanding read that will keep you asking for more,General Slaight comes out as a likeable hero who you can relate to. You do not even have to be associated with The Point in order to enjoy this read and what a read! It keeps you on your seat and always asking for more. You can feel the tension in the story- a true master piece.
5,Works perfect,If u need cheap coax cable wire... This is what u want..for the amount you get and the price it costs.. This is the best deal out there...:)
4,High Interest Reading for Teen With Limited Literacy Skills,"From the back of the Pacesetters edition -Mystery In New MexicoSomeone or some thing was in the ruins. Was it a living person? Or was it a kachina - an Indian spirit?Whatever it was, it had tried to kill Ray Brant and Black Bear. And it would try again unless it was stopped.The Pacesetters series is high interest reading for those who have literacy problems, or who just have a reluctance to read. The reading level for these books is between 2 and 3. Many of these books are mentioned in reference material concerning High/Low materials."
1,"If you want a sleeping aid, this is the book for you","I bought this book based on the rave reviews of other customers. Unfortunately, this book is quite possibly one of the dullest uninteresting books I have ever read, and believe me, I have read some bad books. The author of this book should be imprisoned for cheating us out of our money because this book is horrible. If you don't believe me, take your chances, but if you are smart, you will bypass this book. If you make the mistake of purchasing this, you will find yourself drifting onto other thoughts after reading only one line."
1,actually less than one star,"If you have nothing to do, do nothing. It's better than wasting time and money with this book."
1,Worthless,"This book is worthless and goes more into the atypical asset classes the author has auctioned off as opposed to the intricacies of any deal structures. The ""real estate maverick"" took over and bankrupted his father's company. The author's firm, Sheldon Good, filed for Ch.11 bankruptcy protection after the author committed suicide earlier this year (2009). The company claims ""improper actions by its former chairman"" as the reason for its seeking bankruptcy protection. The author, Steven Good, was the chairman they are referring to. Suffice to say, the $800 collectible copies may not be the wisest investment."
5,"Very soft, deep pockets",These are incredibly soft flannel sheets. The pockets are so deep on the fitted sheet that you can tuck them well under the mattress and there's no problem with them pulling out if you're a restless sleeper.
1,Received Stained Sheets...Yuck!,"I ordered these sheets in December and just recently bought a queen bed. I put them on my bed at night and the next morning, after sleeping in them, I noticed a stain on top of the sheet. Upon further inspection I found a huge stain on the bottom of the sheet. They arrived in the package nicely folded and pressed - not like someone had used them and stuffed them back in. Since it's been over 30 days the return policy stinks - I have to pay to ship them back so that they refund only 1/2 what I paid - it's not worth it.My advice to you --> immediately open the package when you get it home!"
4,Soft and Comfortable!,"Very pleased with my purchase of Laura Ashley Lidia Cotton Flannel Sheets. Extremely soft! I highly recommend these flannels sheet. My husband and I were worried the sheets may feel itchy to the skin, but to our surprise they are very soft and comfortable. I will be purchasing another set."
2,Produces Useable Maps,"Family Atlas works very well in pulling in the information from a genealogy program. It is an excellent resource for verifying place names and recognizes obsolete place names, giving the current name as well. This feature was especially useful to me, as many of my ancestors lived in towns in areas of Europe that have changed countries. The main product is a world map, however, you can zoom in on a section of the map to produce a map of that portion of the world. The map you produce can be exported to a word processing program, so you can insert the map into your family history story."
5,These guys know what's up...,"Man, every now and then you might come across a band you've never heard before that really gets to you. Well, that's these guys for me. I loved this set the first time I listened to it, and every time I hear these discs I appreciate them more. One thing: I came across this disk from another page with mostly emo bands on there, but I definitely wouldn't call this stuff emo. These guys are punk as hell, simply not by what's getting called punk these days. Cap'n Jazz reminds me alot of the Descendents, with all sorts of other cool stuff thrown in: Sonic Youth/Ween/Murder City Devils, yeah, I hear Devo in there too. Ha, cool. Anyway, these tracks are super-creative and put together so as to keep you on your toes with all sorts of surprises. The vocals straight up rock. All in all, this is just a sweet band. I bet Cap'n Jazz would have been a great show to see, wish I had gotten that chance. Right on guys, thanks for this one..."
5,"ahh...a wonderful cd, makes me want to smile and cry","as it says, this is such a great album, you have to appreciate them due to the fact that they were sincere. i mean, they actually did their own thing musically..not this typical emo..complaint ridden thing...its totally original...also the vocals that really cant sing make it even better...its such a great album..disc 2 is my fav...and ""we're troubled by insects"" would have to be my fav song on the album...its so catchy its annoying almost but you have to love it hehehe."
4,missing tune,"anyone who has listened to Braid's ""Frankiewelfareboyage5"" album knows about how they used thier friend's band's song samples inbetween their tracks. on one of those samples you can hear a band (which sounds alot like cap'n jazz) singing the immortal lines: ""i'm sorry you had to catch me watching your sister pee.""that particular song is not presented here, sad to say."
5,I bought this w/o knowing... What a good call that was!,"Great, fast, dynamic, exciting. Wonderfully strained vocals that are buried just right.Hyper, sincere. This will live in my car for the summer."
4,Makes you want to jump around; it's happy punk rock!,"If you believe punk can be adorable, you should give this album a listen. If you believe in being happily angry, this will be your soundtrack. It's a bunch of kids using pop sensibilities to create punk flavored social commentary that is not your typical trite youthful angst. The lyrics have a bit more to offer than your standard FM punk fare, and the music is broader. You gotta love the raucous ""Take On Me"" cover. Not as serious as June of 44, less easy on the ears as Modest Mouse, more fun than Drive Like Jehu, it's imaginative and fun, bouncy. Side one is chock full of anthems. Give it a chance."
5,one of my favorites.,"i've owned at least two copies of this double-disc compilation, and have managed to play all four discs until they wouldn't work anymore. you can tell they were young and having a blast - they play with a ton of energy, especially on those live tracks."
4,Really good EP,Really like this band and the way they use a string section.All the songs are really good with Dying Is Fine the best of all look foward to next album.I heard the drummer died in a swimming accident it will be interisting to see if they change their sound he wrote a lot the music on this album.
5,The best book you will find on amatuer motorsports,"If you want the one source for how to get started in amatuer motorsports - look no more - this is your book. From how to shop for a car to how much it will cost, this book covers all bases. While you will still need guest reviewer Carrol Smith's series on preparation, this book provides a launching pad for how to get started. I find myself re-reading it time and time again for there is so much information to use. I can only hope that this book receives the exposure it deserves - I am now racing cars instead of watching them on TV and my thanks go out to the Author.PS - My wife wishes this one never found it to my door. Any reprints should include a chapter on how to convince the family that racing is a good thing"
4,Great book which covers some things not covered in others.,"Such as what to expect at an SCCA event as far as tech inspections, and equipment checks, and what not. It also provides several different viewpoints from different drivers. It, at times, is almost like sitting around the table with the guys, and discussing racing.It IS a little lite on content in some places. Speed Secrets is as good if not better for the beginner, along with Going Faster! For more in-depth coverage of the topics."
1,"Good blender until it breaks, and warranty = zero","I was very happy, until this blender broke. Was very careful with it, but after only 5 weeks, it was done. Called the ""hassle free replacement warranty customer satisfaction center"" and they said they would ship out a new one. Great!Only 4 weeks LATER they called to say they can't replace it, they're out of stock, they will 'buy it back' from us. Gosh, they have them on their web site, but they can't ship one. Turns out, it will take 6-8 WEEKS to process our return, in addition to the week to ship the mailer, and the 4 weeks we've waited for the replacement to begin with.13 weeks is supposed to be 'hassle-free' replacement ??I will -NEVER- buy another kitchen-aid product, and I will encourage everyone to realize that their 'hassle-free replacement warranty' is absolutely worthless!!! Totally false advertising!!!"
1,careful to buy,"i purchased the hand blender and was so excited. however i used it 3 x and somehow stopped working. it doesnt work anymore. smoke started coming out, i dont know why. good thing it happened early so i was able to call the company and they will issue another one under 1 yr warranty. warranty should be longer than 1 yr. just like the cuisinart. oh well. i recommend using the product quickly and see it doesnt wear out."
5,Immersion blender,"[[ASIN:B00008GSAB KitchenAid KHB300WH Hand Blender,I own one and gave this as gift to my daughter in law. Mine does not have all the accessories, but really wish that I had ordered them.These blenders are great. Saves a lot of dish washing, works very well with strong motors."
5,Great Product,"This product works beautifully when making soups, sauces, etc. It's much easier than any other method of blending ingredients, with much better results."
5,Great product.,"My husband was looking at Kitchenaid immersion blenders when I ran across this set. I bought it for him for his birthday but I ended up being the first one to use it. I love the chopper attachment. The first time I used it I chopped broccoli and turkey for a turkey/broccoli braid and then chopped turkey, onion and pickles for turkey salad. It was great. I have a hand chopper that I really liked but this beats it. I usually use my food processor for chopping turkey, onions, etc. but this is smaller and does just as good a job. I've also used the chopper to chop walnuts and it was wonderful. I have only used the whisk attachment once and haven't used the immersion blender attachment yet at all but I'm sure we won't be disappointed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
2,can't be cleaned!,"product is generally good. I would say that for the price you get fair product with strong motor and nice design. Unfortunately, it is impossible to clean food that gets beneath the plastic disc under rotating knife!!! This can easily cause food poisoning! I've spent 50min cleaning remains of mayo I made, using hot water, soap, and even paper to reach under the disc, and still there was more coming out when disc is pushed down... Too bed they messed up this part. I've returned it."
4,What's with the bag?,"Everyone likes this appliance, I do too, so I won't rehash all that.My comment is: What's with the dorky bag? It is a perfect example of a great idea done wrong. If you are going to make a bag, make it fit everything. A bag to hold the mixer base and all the attachments/bowls would be a huge innovation. Aren't you tired of rummaging through all your drawers for that one little attachment? But a bag that holds MOST of the stuff is just senseless. Now a nice stand for it all... Sigh...Buy this thing, you won't be sorry. Just don't expect too much from the bag."
4,"Versatile Versatile, Excellent addition to any kitchen","I received one a few years ago. I use it almost every day. I recently gave one to a friend who was thrilled to receive it. I chop, mix, puree, blend, stir. You do have to use a bowl with plenty of room however for the whip attachment. It may be my technique but the liquids do over lap the bowl edge easily. This is a great food processor alternative for 1 or 2 people households. Clean up of parts is a breeze and it fits easily into a drawer."
1,Powerful but plastic disc came loose,The plastic disc between the blade and the housing came loose and got caught in the blades chopping some of the plastic into my smoothie which I unknowingly drank. When I asked Sur La Table(specialty kitchen store) if that part could be replaced I saw that their Kitchenaid demo's disc was also loose and had been sheared by the blade. I've had Cuisinart and Braun in the past and their motors burned out. This one was my favorite so far. I guess I'll have to get a Viking next and hopefully last.
3,no good after 8 months of use but kitchenaid customer service excellent.,"purchased this unit in april 20009 through amazon thinking after 10 years of a cheap braun mixer (which worked for just fine) i should upgrade. mor watt, more speed. or so i thought. make smoothies and soup on occasion. no major usage, family of four. now blender is inoperable because the main connecting part inside the motor unit is loose and it wonlt hold (or turn) attachments properly. it is plastic (why would this be made out of plastic? i have been waiting for reply from kitchenaid but so far nothing. will by the 25 dollar braun immersion blender again, it totally did the trick.to update: kitchenaid did contact me and once they did the replacement was very easy and fast, i was very happy how they handled this. (but still think it shouldn't break after such a short time.."
4,returned,"This immersion blender was returned, for NO fault of the blender, it just wasn't what I wanted. I purchased a Bamix, which was like one I'd had years ago. However, I find that Kitchen Aid appliances are good products in general."
5,Great way to blend cream soups!,"I've only used mine twice, but it was much easier than trying to put a soup through a blender. The hand held blender made the process much easier, saved me time, and easy to clean.Looking forward to using it when the need arises to whip cream."
2,"No longer works, attachment wand is frozen","Purchased it about a year ago, used it a dozen times, cleaned the blade promptly after every use, but it is now frozen and will not budge."
5,Highly recommended,I have been using this blender just about every day since I received it.What can I say? I love it! Specially the attachments.Lots of power and easy to clean up and store.
5,My best friend in the kitchen,"I use this hand blender every single day!! also a friend came to visit me for a couple of days with her daughter and she order one to do the milk mix she normally does every morning. It is so practical for kids daily mixes, soup creams in the pam and everything else you need to blend with out using this big machine. Also, I had an issue with my hand blender and Kitchenaid was very effective in customer service and replacing my broken piece with a new one after a couple of months a bougth it.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AND ANY OTHER KITCHEN AID"
1,Stainless Steel Blending breaks and customer service doesn't really help.,"I bought KitchenAid KHB300OB Hand Blender, Onyx Black 8 months ago. I was using every pieces of KitchenAid Blender. But the plastic piece of Stainless Steel Blending doesn't broke about a month ago, which I used only for soups. I din't force it, no damage, no drop. Other pieces of Blender do work very well. Having the warranty, I called the customer service. They wanted me to send a fax about the product information and told me that they'd send me the new piece. I sent to fax several times and nobody call me, nor they did send the piece. I don't want to buy and to pay for another blender. So my advice is you should thing about buying this blender..."
4,KitchenAid hand blender,"Unlike my previous hand blender,this KitchenAid motor connnects easily and firmly to the attachments. The motor speed and strength is excellent. it will remain to be seen how long this product lasts. I have had several others of different brands and they do not last long at all."
4,Smoothy,Great for making fruit smoothys. Tried mash potatoes turned out too smooth. Still dont understand why a red unit has to cost more. Black one works fine for less. Getting the chopper attachment is worth it.
4,Not a gadget girl...,"but this immersion blender is AWESOME! I love to cook, but I am a real skeptic when it comes to kitchen gadgets (c'mon, do you really need a garlic peeler cluttering up your drawers when a good whack with a knife gets the peel right off??). I've had this blender about three weeks & love it- smoothies, chopping onions, soups, salad dressings - things that I used to avoid doing because it was too much of a pain to clean the food Cuisinart are now a snap & clean up is much simpler."
2,Kitchen aid blender chopper,"the entire problem with this item is that is the Plastic gears in the motor housing and the chopping/blending attchements.. If you aren't VERY careful to get it totally seated, the gears in the housing strip at the first use and the entire unit becomes unusable. Initial use can be difficult wih any unit even when reading the nstructions. It would be nice if they would include new gears so they could be replaced..or better yet, make them of metal. $89.00 down the tube.;-("
1,Loved it until it died,"I owned this for 14 months and loved it. I used it to make all types of things and it was really handy to own. When I purchased it I skipped over the lesser models planning to own this for a long time. I should have saved my money. One day as I am pureeing some soup it just stopped working. Nothing. Of course I was a few months past the warranty so I was stuck. Now I am buying a less expensive model with the plan of replacing it every so often.To it's credit I cook a lot and I use my equipment a lot. Reading the reviews of people that love this and call it tough, I imagine they do not do as much as I do. Because of that they might get five years if they are lucky. In my book that is not good enough for this price tag.So if you are an occasional cook and color and brand name matter buy this. Otherwise save the money."
5,"Take it from a pro, this is a great blender set!","I read the one star reviews about this machine breaking and I can't believe it. I am a chef, classically trained at the CIA in NY, and this blender can handle anything I throw at it. I use it at least once or twice a week and have had it for around seven years now. It has great power, the whisk whips up cake mixes(yes, I cheat sometimes) like a dream, and makes creamy mashed potatoes right in the pot you boiled them in!! That saves a mess! The food processor is great and easy to clean, decent capacity too. The blender works quickly and the variable speed lets you start slow and work up, which is essential with some foods. All around this is a beautiful machine that I wouldn't be without in a home or professional setting. I just can't say enough about it, I'm a believer in the KitchenAid name and this product is certainly no exception. In fact, just using this blender makes me smile, simply a pleasure to blend, whip and process!! :)"
4,Solid and Useful,"I ordered the KitchenAid KHB300 in lieu of the Cuisinart SmartStick from Crate&Barrel because of the reviews. I'm very glad I decided to do some research. The KitchenAid's stainless steel shaft is solid and durable, the blades on both the blender and the food chopper are sharp and well positioned. The unit feels professional to the touch and I love the variable speed (1-9) functionality that many of the immersion blenders don't offer. I have used the blender every day for the past 3 weeks for smoothies, guacamole, grinding fresh coffee beans and making pesto. It cleans easily and with the right amount of pulsing and speed adjustments you are able to get the consistency just right for everything you might need to blend/puree/grind."
4,Plastic parts on the motor won't take a beating,"I loved this hand blender until it stopped working today. The blades on the stick are great, they blend frozen berries for smoothies and whip cream very well and quickly. The chopper is nice and small and a great little tool in the kitchen when I don't feel like dragging the big food processor out. The little chopper will make a 2-4 servings of pesto, chimichurri and tapenade.I have had no problems with food residue at all. I use the hand blender at least 1-2 times a week. My issue is the plastic housing the motor comes in, if you are not careful in snapping on the attachment, the housing will heat up and wear down quickly. Basically after 3 years of use, the plastic motor housing is stripped. The motor still runs, it just does not move the attachments anymore."
1,False Advertisement,"I purchased two of these clocks because both the copy and the photo of the item showed it was made in US. It is not!!! It is made in China like every other clock I could have bought at my local discount store without paying shipping. If, like me, you are avoiding Chinese products, do not buy this."
1,cheap clock,"Even though this clock doesn't cost much, whatever it costs is too much! the lighted dial only works faintly on one side and it is hard to set. Save your money on this one. Try another brand."
4,"Though a classic, they even got better further along!","I was introduced to these first two of Sacred Warrior's works back in '88 while far away from my home state of Idaho.(Was selling books in Texas in the ""Bible Belt"" for college money.) Being a rabid fan of heavy metal for most my life, and loving bands with singers that had TRUE TALENT...you know, have a vocal range worth something. Bands like Soundgarden and Queensryche and few others have such quality singers. Sacred Warrior DOES! The songs to listen to are definately ""Master's Command"", ""Paradise"", ""He Died"" and ""Rebellion""...in that order, if possible. These will be tunes you will catch yourself humming! But by all means, LISTEN FURTHER! Their third and fourth albums are extra rich in talented lyrics and soulful singing. ENJOY..."
1,Very Poor Quality CD's,"This item deserves a zero as a rating. I never had problems with CDs as I did with this 8-CD set. They refuse to play when you make a selection. When I placed them in multiple CD players, they sounded as if an airplane was taking off. These are very poor quality CDs for $100. Do not waste your money on this item."
1,Poorest Quality,"I have never had so many problems with a CD set as I have had with this one. I returned my first set to Amazon due to several of the discs being damaged to the point that the tracks I needed could not be listened to. Right out of the box some of the discs were scratched or had visible imprints from the case material on them. Amazon was great and quickly sent me a replacement set, but amazingly I had the same problems with the next set. I, like you probably do, need the set for a college class so I could not afford to lose more time in returning another set for a replacement. After spending $90.00 for an item you are required to have it is infuriating to deal with this sort of thing. Unless you are absolutely stuck don't buy this CD set or you will really be stuck!"
3,A decent first-time effort from a new writer,"I read this book for research for my own trip to Vietnam this summer. Although it's not the best travel book I've read, it's helpful by giving readers insight into Vietnamese everyday life. Although Muller sounds sort of whiny at times, her writing isn't cursed with the naive wide-eyed wonderment typical of a lot of travel writers. The book is both interesting, but at times unsettling...I couldn't help feeling at times that the entire nation of Vietnam existed solely to rip off foreigners. But, maybe I took it too personally because I'm half Vietnamese. Her advice on bargaining is something I haven't found in any of my guide books--most tell you simply to do it, but they don't explain HOW to do it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning their first trip to Vietnam, but I would hate for someone to base their opinion of the Vietnamese people solely on Muller's observations."
5,"Great ""down to earth"" 1st hand account",After first seeing the documentary on TV I decided to pick up this book. I enjoyed Karin's way of describing the everyday hardship of adventure traveling. Do not get hung up on the title. Karin uses all mans to get around which in my mind is needed if you travel for that lenght of time. All in all great first time writing...well worth picking up.
3,"It's worth the read, but don't expect too much.","I learned a lot about what it would be like to travel Vietnam and so in that sense the book served it's purpose. If you are planning to go, especially on a budget trip there or nearby, I recommend this book. The book is somewhat stimulating and so is the authors' adventurism. However, she often goes on and on about getting ripped off by this person and that person. This is hard to avoid though, since in many countries, people are always forcing you to negotiate for even the most trivial items. FYI, the book also lacks any sexual experiences as well as any explanation about her attitudes towards the subject. 7 months without sex?! Just curious to know. Also, I think she misunderstood ""Jay"" as a simple minded person, but there must be more too him than that."
1,This book is pathetic!,"It's just pathetic, and doesn't reflect any positive sides of Vietnam. And it's way out-of-date."
2,Good effort,"I applaud her for being a lone Caucasian female traveler which is hard to do in any lesser developed country. She is also a good writer and had her moments in the book.Otherwise, she seemed quite naive about the culture and state of Vietnam, was overly optimistic about the people and when she was disappointed, became extremely bitter about her experience.If you want to read about reasons not to visit Vietnam, read this book. I would also change the title of the book because it is misleading. She really only hitchhiked about the last quarter of the book."
5,"Inspiring, Relatable Travel Writing","This book immediately reminds me of my own sentiments on travel and the appreciation of this world we share with more than just Americans. The perspective gained by experiencing other cultures is something I wish all Americans held dear. I am inspired by the way Muller writes and delivers the minute details, which would otherwise seem banal without her timing and creativity.Perfect for anyone wondering ""what else is out there"". Is the grass truly greener? What is a truly basic existence?"
5,Loved it!,"Karin Muller is an honest, fun and entertaining writer and world traveler.The book is a joy to read (finished in 3 days)I have read her newest book Japanland and loved it.As I always do when I read a book by a writer I love, I trace other books by them.Many times older books are not as good, as many writers mature and get better with life's experiences.Not in this case, I was not disappointed and very happy that I did not take to heart the reviews on Amazon.We also bought her book ALONG THE INCA ROAD and I can't wait to read it. (It is in my husband's suitcase and he is on his way to New Zealand.Karin Muller is the kind of woman you would be happy to call your friend."
1,The cover photo is pretty.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after seeing it featured on the pbs.org website. My friend had it on her bookshelf so I asked to borrow it. She does write very well and is easy to follow but that is the only positive I saw. It felt like she wrote more about her negative experiences and I kept reading on thinking it would get better but alas never did. It seems to me she had a horrible time and would probably never return again. I also went out and checked out the film version from the library. Besides the title it didn't even look like it was based on her book. Her travel campanion, Jay, wasn't even in it although she was nice enough to acknoledge him in the credits. The book was bland and the film was even worse. I returned the book to my friend and told her to keep it at the bottom of the stack. Read ""Catfish and Mandala"" for a better travelogue."
4,Zaffiro,"A very talented Guitar player, song writer, and singer. These were his two finest albums. They mixed the Christian metal sound with tender ballads. Scarlet storm is more edgy and provides the best reproduction of a storm (using a guitar) that I have heard. For any fan of Petra, Whiteheart, Mylon, or other popular 80s early 90s CCM fans this is a must-buy."
3,"Serviceable, but barely as nice as the price","It's an OK knock off European provincial tablecloth. It was not expensive, and it does not look expensive."
2,"Entertaining enough, but not riveting:","Open & Shut is an acceptable ""who done it"" mystery with moderately likable characters, but is in no way a masterpiece. The lead character is entertaining in the beginning, but is quickly tiresome because his particular brand of humor is a bit overdone. The development is quite slow, so the story does remain still at times. Open & Shut is at its best in the last quarter of the book, so the venture was not a total loss."
3,"Fun, but disappointing","I read about the author in Cesar Milan's mag and thought the combo of dog and mystery would be super! The mystery part was okay - started slow and got a little better, but no great read. The dog part was almost non-existent. Maybe in the sequels?"
5,Excellent Debut & a perfect beach read,"Wonderfully wry legal thriller that moves quickly and keeps the reader's attention. I'd love to see another book about this confident but compassionate lawyer, Andy Carpenter (yes, a compassionate lawyer) and next time, learn more about him (other than he loves golden retreivers and sports). Great supporting cast of characters, too - his investigatttor, Laurie & his potential law partner Kevin, the ""law""dromat attorney. Great job by David Rosenfelt on this debut!"
3,Predictable but humorous (spoiler below),"The main character has the snide but intelligent humor of Sean Drummond (in the Brian Haig novels) and the book moves at a breathtaking clip - one could not accuse the writer of boring with details. However, that same headlong race to get through the set-up for a new trial of a convicted killer, the trial preparation, and the trial itself, in the midst of an investigation of a personal family incident that may tie to the trial, means that there is no chance to feel anything about the characters and their experiences. The characters don't feel much either. Very predictable conclusion (spoiler here: don't all rich college boys have a murder in their background to hide for 50 years?)."
4,Excellent start to a promising new series!,"This is definitely one author to watch for. I enjoyed this book so much I went ahead and ordered the rest of the Andy Carpenter books. Publisher's Weekly pretty much well summarizes the plot, nonetheless despite the relative plot contrivances the story still works thanks to Mr. Rosenfelt's witty and effortless writing style. His smart alecky, self depracating humor will recall other writers, particularly Harlan Coben. Personally by this book alone I'd state that Mr. Rosenberg is well ahead of the pack in the writing department. I am hoping the quality is maintained in the next books, and it will be passed around to my coworkers (just as Mr. Coben's books were also passed around) and friends."
4,"Quick, funny & enjoyable read","You know, sometimes you just need something that is not so serious, and just plain funny. That is what I enjoyed so much about this book. I read it really quick, and I smiled and grinned the whole time. I enjoyed Andy Carpenter's sarcasm so much, I think I am going to have to steal some of his lines! I will definately read the rest of the books in this series."
4,Fun Read,I've just discovered this author a few months ago and I just love reading his books. They are so entertaining in the respect that he has a tongue in cheek way in his writing and wit to boot. He is an animal lover which is why I probably also like his books. He is a lawyer who defends people that he knows are innocent (for the most part) It is just lighthearted and a page turner to boot.
3,Funny with attitude,Entertaining with twist and turns. love his outlook and superstitions. you gotta love Tara. nice read with quick wit and more
5,Book review,"Another new author for me. Good story, interesting characters, good plotting, kept me reading and wanting to see what happens next. That's what I call a good read. I will add David Rosenfelt to my list of authors to read in the future."
3,First in the series is not bad.,"This legal thriller about defense attorney Andy Carpenter is not bad but nothing really memorable either. He is a guy who likes good looking women, dogs, and sports. In this appeals case, Andy defends a black man named Willie who has an enormous amount of evidence against him for murder. Could Willie have been framed by powerful people? Was his dad involved? A photo found in his recently deceased father's attic could have the clues. People soon start trying to intimidate and even kill Andy as he delves further into unraveling the case. It's a pretty good book and some of the lines were funny, but overall I don't think it is anything to make you go ""Wow!"", and you will probably forget all about it soon."
4,Terrific Book!,"I just read this book, and am now a number one fan of this author! He weaves a great story line with humor and suspense. His writing reminds me of Robert Parker, and that is a huge compliment!"
2,Poor technical support for a program with many bugs,"Purchased program at full cost. Identified flaw and after trying to correct it myself, I called technical support. They acknowledged that the bug that I identified (Not able to use numbers)had been identified as a problem on some other discs. Instead of sending me a debugged disc, they wasted hours making me retrain another user x2. they were supposed to have me send files so that they could analyze them, the files were never sent . Program often crashes computer. Instead of trying to help technical support was wasting hours of my time trying to figure out the bugs, I am very angry about their rudeness and insensitivity. I still have not had the problem resolved and have lost countless hours of productivity."
4,Sir Patrick,"I loved it,but the disapointment is that he never got the championship ring - even after all the years he played, and all the points he made."
3,Classic in lost world fiction,"This book is a classic work in its era, reminiscent of Conan Doyle's ""The Lost World"" and Burroughs' ""The Land that Time Forgot"", chronicling the discovery of Atlantis.This is a fine bit of Edwardian-era escapism, pleasurable if you are interested in this sort of work, not so for those of a more casual interest.Like many such books, it appears formulaic today because of its imitators."
1,??,The clock didn't work at all -- but I threw out the box that it came in so was unable to return it. Bought one at Radio Shack.
5,Great little alarm,"What a surprise to get so much for so little. This is a perfect little travel alarm that does exactly what it's supposed to do, very simply."
2,Wetclox Journey,The clear faceplate curves in front of the numbers so that it almost guarantees that there will be reflections in the way (at least in alighted room). So I bought the Westclox Echo to replace it.
4,"Good, but not great","This book has a lot of very nice pictures and some text to go along with them. However, other than the part about the Kingdome demolition, the reader is given few details about how the demolition of a structure was done and what the various considerations were in deciding the exact methods used. An equation or two would have been informative..."
3,Break out the hard hats and blasting caps...,"This book is quite a blast, literally, because it gives the reader some first-hand knowledge of how the building demoltion process takes place. And it shows this with some clear pictures and diagrams. The Kingdome implosion, in particular, stands out because of the level of detail that went into explaining it. All in all, this is a great book to give the budding young engineer or to keep on the family coffee table."
4,Lovely Choral Writing,This is a very handsome piece of choral music. The format and style may strike some as somewhat undifferentiated but I think this work repays careful listening and the music has considerable power. The choral singing is excellent and the soloists are first rate.
5,"When the Boys are not Your Own, What Do You Do?","I've raised five sons and recognize many points from the map laid out in this book. At some points the direction was wisely taken, but not always. I would have found ""Boy Talk"" helpful back then. Now I am serving as a volunteer advocate for young boys caught up in the oddly misnamed child welfare system. I have used ""Boy Talk"" as the source of research-based information on both troubled and normal emotional development. Taking care for boys in a society that minimizes the emotional dangers they face in becoming whole, effective adults means you need support from the researchers. Otherwise the prejudices and stereotypes will probably undermine your efforts and keep building emotionally empty men."
5,Some of the greatest books.. ever!!!!!!!,"I bought this pack of books, and I think these are some of the greatest books I've ever read. I've read too many... and none are the best, but these are some of my favorites! Julie Edwards/Miyax Kapugen is stuck on the tundra. She learns by watching a pack of wolves the language of them. She becomes a member of the pack, led by Amoroq. They give her food and she travels with them. She becomes friends with Amoroq's pup, Kapu, and when he is the new Alpha, Julie helps the pack stay strong throughout all three books (Julie of the Wolves, Julie, and Julie's Wolf Pack). I highly recommend this to anyone that respects animals and nature. We should all appreciate them!"
3,julie and her wolves,"I only gave this book a three because the middle gets really boring, but other than that its really good.The book is about a girl who runs away from her home. When she runs away some of the problems she runs into is a food shortage and she can't communicate with the wolves until she studies them and learns there language."
2,Not deep enough,"The hat was too shallow, the quality was good. I thought it was a snap back, its a velcro back."
4,Good bag; shame about the fittings,"So. A good stout bag; if you have one camera (say, a Canon D30 or a Nikon D80) with a longish zoom, this is the bag for you. The bag itself is stout. However, the straps that come with it (a shoulder strap and a set of straps that allow you to wear it on your chest) have plastic fitments. There is a reason that other companies (e.g. Domke) use metal. Metal doesn't break. Plastic does.Conduct yourself accordingly"
4,Close to Great,Roger NNorrington and his SWR players offer up a pleasing performance buta couple of things keep me from giving the final star.I heard things in this performance that were not in others that made itbe more open. The timpani in the Scene aux chammps was more pronounced which I enjoyed. The sticking point for me was The March to the scaffold.To me it was a leisurely stroll;way to slow. And I just cannot get used to the repeat at the start. It just does not seem right to me. The finale is great. Great recorded sound.It was nice to have the added overture as a filler to make generous disc.
1,A Sad Follow Up.....,"to the much better book written by Richard Ben Cramer. I don't know how anyone can take a book seriously from a man who kissed DiMaggio's behind the past 16 years simply to make money off of him. Cramer's book is far superior in my opinion, mainly because it comes from an unbiased author. Those who revered DiMaggio may have a hard time reading Cramer's book because it reveals the Yankee great for who and what he really was. This book does not add anything new to the DiMaggio ""legend""."
2,Engelberg and Cramer are both scum,"After knowing little of the Dimaggio, Cramer, Engelberg situation this book sheds little light on who actually was looking out for Joe. Engelberg portrays himself as a Joe D worshipper in most unbelievable ways. He details how he helped Joe make millions of dollars without any compensation while Joe was alive. Basically the book is Engelberg's long winded attempt to clear his name when, in doing so, the book heightens suspicions of Engelberg. In my humble opinion, Engelberg and Cramer were both out to take advantage of Joe and some claims made in each book are likely valid. I enjoyed reading the book up to 80 pages, after which the book goes on to glorify Engelberg to ad nauseam."
1,"Buyer beware, Do not read if you are a Joe Dimaggio Fan",Morris Engelberg owes us all who paid for this book our money back. Everybody was out to screw Joe except thankgoodness he met Morris to be some superhero to Joe. Morris is a petty little man who claims to have never made money off of Joe but writing this book is terrible. Nice to paint yourself in such a light that Joe owed all his financial wins to you. What a jerk. Please do not do Morris anyfavors and buy this. Nice that Morris spends less than 70-80 pages on his career but over 50 pages on how everybody tried to screw Joe out of money. Morris do us all a favor and go buy the rest of your books off the shelf and stop trying to make a cheap dime and proliferate yourself.
1,Morris Vindicates Morris!,"Engelberg produces an unusual text. The first part chroniclesthe early life of Joe Dimaggio, all of which can be found in other books. In most of the rest of the book, Engleberg is more concerned with rehabilitating his own reputation than he is withsetting the record straight about Joe. Morris portrays himself asgenerous, selfless, caring, loyal, and crafty. This self-picture contrasts with the descriptions other authors have given of Morris. But does anyone really care about Engleberg, other than his immediate circle?"
5,The REAL DiMaggio stands up !,"Setting the Record Straight does just that. This book gives you the real DiMaggio, blemished as well as haloed. As a huge baseball fan - but not a Yankee fan - it was refreshing to read about a baseball icon without having to read page after page of pitch-by-pitch accounts of hundreds of at bats. Too many baseball books have already done that. But this book tells the STRAIGHT story including the complexities of number 5s personality.There are humorous moments but also extremely intriguing accounts of Joe D.'s life including the one subject he refused to comment on throughout his life: Marilyn.However, I admit it took me longer than expected to finish this fine book...whenever I put it down my wife snagged it like a deep line drive out to the monuments in the Yankee Stadium outfield. Unlike DiMaggio, however, she did not fire it back to ""home plate"". At least I got the remote."
1,A Sad Follow Up.....indeed.,"There isn't much more that I can add to the already written review so titled. Mr. Engelberg does his profession a great disservice,in his pathetic handling of his client for the the last 16 years of his life. In Richard Ben Cremer's far superior write, There is a great deal more honesty. He even printed Mr. Engelberg's angry,blustery letter/response. The shady way that Mr. Engelberg ""acquired"" Joe's 1936 World Series ring,after the man wasn't dead 5 minutes, is disgusting--to say the least."
4,Better than Cramer's book,"I'll admit, Engelberg is a bit suspicious. This is a man who claims to love Joe but after his death he tried to sell personal items of Joe's (such as his credit card, social security card, etc.) I guess the best part of this book is that it has direct quotes from those who truly knew Joe, such as his granddaughters.(In Cramer's book he barely mentions Joe's granddaughters, making it appear as if Joe had absolutely no family, when indeed he did.) Engelberg doesn't paint Joe out to be a saint or satan. For instance, Joe had no problem refusing an autograph to a man but he never did it to kids or women. Also in many biographies people claim that Joe hit his ex-wife but a woman who worked for Joe said that when Joe found out that her husband was beating her he told her to leave him because women shouldn't be treated that way.Any review that actually praises Cramer should be null and void."
2,DiMaggio...,"Joe Dimaggio was a pompous jerk, who mandated that had to be call <the greatest player who ever lived> when he was introduced at the ""stadium."" He also had to be the ""last"" person to enter, and therefore have the most attention, where ever he went too. His brother Dom had more class in his baby finger than Joe. There is no doubt that Joe was a great ball player and very well could be the greatest to ever play the game, but he destroyed, in my opinion his greatness, with his own narcissism. Setting the record strait never does."
5,Very well built,"We've had this tube for a couple years now. I tied a rope to the handles and routinely drag my kids to the sled hill a few blocks away. This often entails crossing bare asphalt (streets are plowed, sidewalks aren't); the tube handles it no problem. I've always assumed a popped tube is the price of going sledding so I don't even try to protect it - but it survived all my abuse. Very highly recommended and when it does finally pop, I'll be buying another one."
4,So cute!,"I just received the Peach Sorbet baby bedding and we are very happy with it. I will agree with the other reviews that the colors are a lot more muted than they seem on the internet. If you are expecting bright & bold colors this is not the bedding for you. Although they match great with the babies room, of which we painted a dark burgundy. All in all the bedding is very soft and cuddly and looks great. We are very pleased with our choice."
4,Fun Facts To Pass The Time,"My wife and I picked up this book at an outlet mall. We were going through a ""sale"" bin, and this one jumped out at me because of the title. It's full of amazingly true facts--the kind of things that make great dinner conversation, tidbits for speeches and presentations, and that kind of thing. It's out of print now, so if you come across a copy, I highly recommend picking it up for your library."
4,great product,"I love this product, I only wish it was in different packaging the recyle mark on the back says it's a 7 which I believe means it has bisphenol A. I am hoping the company will change this, because although expensive the product is superior to other such products on the market.I would have given it 5 stars if the packaging had a different recycle number on it."
4,A Fun Classic,"This movie is definitely a SNES classic. It is very fun, silly, and entertaining. You get zoned into this game for several hours (easily)!!!!"
1,Product didn't work,"The video game I bought did not work. Very disappointing. I know it's an old game, but my system works just fine, other games work with it, and I tried putting other games in, they worked, then putting in Zombies, and it didn't work. Very unprofessional to send out a broken item."
4,Fun in regression,I got this item for my 15-year-old brother because he loves zombies and heard of this game. We had so much fun playing this game and the game was in good condition so no problems were eminent. It's old school but quite fun and the zombies aren't so easy to squash off.
5,The cult classic!,"This is a horror videogame from SNES where you go through tons of levals, rescuing neighbors and killing zombies. Forget about Resident Evil, this is the ultimate zombie game. The gameplay is great, the graphics are good compared to some SNES games and the levals are awesome. Get off your *ss and buy the game!"
4,Wow,This is the best game I've played in years. I first played it when I was six and i still love it. It belongs to my cousin but i WISH i HAD IT! They should make a remake on all the new systems.
5,Awwwwwwesome!,These guys are musical geniuses. I don't listen to much modern Christian music since I just can't get into the music. Has to be more than just inspirational lyrics for me to listen to it. These two CDs are great and I hope to find more songs similar to these guys. It's equal or better than any mainstream music!
4,Great industrial/heavy alternative music....,"LUSIS, Mortal's first album is pretty good. Catchy keyboard rhythms with guitar and some voice samplings. I don't mind it, but it pales in comparison to FATHOM their second album. FATHOM is one mega dose of EXCELLENT industrial. If you like industrial, GET IT!!! I like almost every song on there, but I have some favorites. 'Neplusultra' is heavy killer industrial track. 'Jil Sent Me' is a very lovely ballad with cellos and backbeat. 'Above And Beyond' is a catchy industrial tune. 'Rainlight' is a short track telling about a friendship.And my favorite track is next 'Bright Wings'...an awesome backbeat with catchy beat and guitar. Not heavy, not mellow. Itis my absolute favorite. Next would be 'Promulgate', anotherkiller industrial track. 'Electrify' is also a cool but slowertrack that is cool to hear. I recommend FATHOM all the way! Wonderful album. Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because LUSIS is not as great in my opinion..."
5,I MUST OWN THIS CD!!!,That's right. I don't own the most PHENOMENAL ALBUM EVER RELEASED. I have heard it and am now on a crusade to own it. My life has been significantly improved because of this CD. (Listen for the samples from Dune...)
3,Needs better hardware,"The poem is beautiful, I fell in love with it the second I read it. It was a beautiful gift for my husband. The only complaint I have is that it fell apart when I tried to put a picture in the frame. The tabs on the back that hold everything in place all fell out of the wood. You would think the manufacturer would offer better quality for the price. I can find better backing on a frame for $5.99 at walmart. I ordered the frame online and now have to go to BabiesRUs to return it which is a good distance away from my home."
2,POORLY MADE...,"I PURCHASED THIS PICTURE FRAME FOR MY HUSBAND FROM OUR 4 MONTH OLD FOR FATHERS DAY. THE POEM/WRITING ON THE FRAME IS VERY NICE. THE FRAME ITSELF IS POORLY MADE...THERE IS NO HOOK/STAND ON THE BACK OF THE FRAME TO DISPLY IT WITH. THE FRAME ITSELF LOOKS AND FEELS VERY CHEAP AND FLIMSY AND THE MATTING IS SCRATCHED AND PEELING,THE TABS THAT KEEP THE MATTING IN ON THE BACK ARE COMING OUT OF THE FRAME AND I HAVENT EVEN USED IT YET...IT IS VERY CHEAP LOOKING AND I AM DISSAPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE THAT MUCH FOR THIS ITEM. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND PURCHASE A DIFFERENT PICTURE FRAME.THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE POEM...NOT THE FRAME OR THE MATTING."
1,Doesn't fit,"It looks pretty racy, but it would not fit on a standard Taurus steering wheel. It's in the trunk, waiting to be thrown out."
3,Big fan of Stereolab but there's a bit too much filler here,"There are 2 interesting melodic tracks -- A few Steps More and Paradoxale -- but the other tracks border on abstruse and under-cooked. 3 of the tracks are very very short and another is 3 minutes. Basically, this could have been a fine EP, but not a full-length CD."
1,Bad serves,My serves was horrible I didn't even get the right game in the mail it was a meaning less basket ball game that I hated it was from a company I knew nothing about so I couldn't even return it the worse!!
5,Great learning material,"Technical Analysis is a great source for understanding and reading charts. It provides mechanical steps for each element of the chart, and builds on itself as you move forward. There are practical exercises at the end of each section for you to test yourself. It's great for wanting to know all the technical terms and financial jargon when analyzing patterns. Most textbooks that you read during school give you the information, plus a long-winded explanation followed by countless examples that provide more than what is necessary for you to know. With this book, it is straightforward and to the point with each technique that it introduces. I recommend this for anyone who wants to read technical charts like a pro."
2,Sloppy.,"Well, they get points for conveying emotion and being fun to listen to in the car with the windows down in the summer and whatnot, and I suppose they've been pretty influential (though bands who cite them as an influence are usually pretty lame)... but this gets old really fast. It's really sloppy (some people like that, apparently), and there's just too much of an emo vibe going on. Blah."
3,Good,"This is a good video, has nice angles, etc. My only complaint would be that the faster sections come a little too early on; however, it is a video, so you can just go back and keep doing the slower ones until you feel ready..."
3,A good one to help start conversations with ESL students,I'm a new ESL teacher and I help students everyday. I tutor them individually too. I was helped by another book for teaching conversation.Get Them Talking! An ESL Tutoring Guide: Teaching English to Speakers of Other LanguagesThis book is good for ESL teachers who tutor students. It's conversation style teaching too.
2,Not Necessary,"I was a new facilitator for an Adult ESL Conversation Class, and I needed curricular resources. However, I didn't need to buy this and another book. All the resouces I used I found on-line. I did a search on adult ESL conversation and found all the free ideas to carry me through the eight week session."
4,Introduction to collecting and operating toy trains.,"Despite it's rather insipid title, this is a fine book. It gives a good overview of toy train history, tips for restoration and repair, and some very detailed advice on building and operating a toy train layout. If you're interested in prewar tinplate toy trains, this is an excellent first book to buy."
5,Terrible,"Terrible that I still quote and refer to this show regularly despite not having seen it since it left us seven (!?) years ago. Terrible that Fox was stupid enough to cancel it. Terrible that they waited all this time to release the DVDs (and I check ever few weeks!).Terrifically funny, creative, innovative show with a lot of heart. One of those shows that creates goodwill in your heart for all those involved. Cannot wait to have this collection including - OH JOY! - five eps that were never aired."
5,Go ahead and order more than one,"If you've never heard of this before, you're not alone. After you've watched you're going to think of several friends who would absolutely love it who have also never heard of it. Rather than risk losing your copy when they start passing it around, might as well order more than one. They make great gifts!Signed,Andy Richter (HA! not really...)P.S. If you liked this you'll loveThe Tick - The Entire Series.Regards,Andy's friend, Patrick WarburtonP.P.S. Don't forgetGreg the Bunny - The Complete Series, guys.Love,Seth GreenSeriously, if you love any of these and haven't seen any of the others, you'll probably love them, too. All great series. All more than a little bit warped. All cancelled before their time. And when you throw inFirefly - The Complete Series... Wow, do those guys at Fox know how to make bad calls on good shows or what?"
3,"Nice, but...","Unfortunately, I don't find the show as brilliant as most people seem to. I loved Andy Richter on Late Night (and I've had a slight crush on Paget Brewster since she was on Friends), and absurdist comedy is right up my alley, but ... somehow this all feels like I've seen it before. I get Herman's Head flashbacks all the time.There are certainly worse shows to spend your time with, but it didn't ""grab"" me like, say, 30 Rock did."
4,Great Show,"This is a wonderful, clever, and well written show. Every time you watch it you find something new."
4,Wish I could give it 5 stars,"I am SOOOO happy this show was finally released. It is brilliantly written, acted, etc. The show itself is worth every bit of a 5 star review. My only gripe, however, is the replacement of some of music within the episodes. I realize it was a necessary concession to get this released, but I found it very jarring as I watched the eps. Also, the video quality isn't quite up to snuff. I've seen the eps in HD so I know they could have mastered this a bit better. HOWEVER, don't let any of this stop you from picking up this amazing series!"
4,It's a Good Book....,"If you are interested in the topic of golf course architecture, it appears many of the books fall into a few categories. 1) Picture Books 2) Technical Treaties and 3) Books for those with a passing interest.This book falls into the later category. It's well written and very readable.Enjoy."
5,Our three-year old loves these books,"We started with this book line two years ago when I was TDY to Uganda. We've completed the set via Amazon and have bought different books from sellers all over the world. Our daughter is in love with these books. The stories are funny 'histories' of how and why animals across Africa came to be, act certain ways and interact with each other. They all have fantastic endings and we read & re-read them over and over before bedtime. She has dozens of books for a three-year old and, along with her Little Golden Books, these are her favorites...while she can't read them yet, she can tell you the stories -- cover-to-cover -- simply by looking at the pictures."
2,Didn't like Hal,"What's wrong with King Hal? He's supposed to be a good guy, and the main love interest - but he acts like a complete jerk, is a hopeless negotiator to the detriment of his country, is mean to Rani, and one night, sleeps with a someone else(a virgin whom he gets pregnant), intends to marry another princess, but instead ends up marrying up the woman he impregnated, who is a mean, manipulative, cruel person. Yeah right, Hal's an admirable love interest for Rani. He's stupid in his relationships, rude to Rani, impregnates and marries an evil woman, and all along, Rani's heart bleeds/is infuriated by him. I won't be reading any of Klasky's books. I like good guys that I can actually like."
4,The Glasswrights' Journeyman,"I really liked this series i find them very entertaning.The only problem was that i found them boring at the start of the books. They're all very well writen and the language was very discripteve. Klasky is one of the best fantasy wrirters of our time the next Tolkien. In the latest part of the Glasswright series the city of Morenia is set aflame. The only place that king hal can turn to for relief is Liantine and the only way he can get relief from them is marrage to its princess a very homely girl with crossed eyes and rabbit teeth all of this makes for a good adventure.Where does Rani come in? she is asked by hal to acompany him to the nagotiation for the dowry. The question is, will Rani be able to?"
1,you're insane to say the least,"If you think that this author, Mindy L. Klasky, is 1st next to tolkien you're insane. Because these books do not have an ounce of goodness that Tolkien has, and these books shouldn't even be placed in the fantasy section. I thought it looked like a nice fantasy novel, but wow was I sure wrong, what were any of you or me thinking when you checked out this book. BAh."
5,A musical document,"There have been countless versions of Tchaikovsky's piano concerto No. 1. But just a bunch of them owe the Caucasian savagery, mercurial intensity, majestic flavor and required flair to be regarded as peerless.This is precisely, one of them. Wild made a superb performance accompanied by Anatole Fistoulari, that will leave you breathless.A remarkable version that must be included among the top twelve versions ever made of the most known Piano Concerto ever composed.In addition, Dohnayi's Variations on a nursery song is the best version in the market all the way through.A golden album to be collected."
1,"Alan Skorski: Just Another ""Lying Liar""","Claims without substantiation--that's all we have here. Skorski seems to have taken the methodology Franken exposes in his ""Lying Liars"" book and used it, taking advantage of all the nefarious ""research"" possibilities that Franken found in people like Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Ann Coulter and making them his own.There's no concern with truth here. The book is no more than a smear."
1,THIS is literature? I think not.,"Whatever you think of Al Franken, at least he writes well, has a sense of humor and doesn't take himself too seriously. This book is simply an excuse for someone with an axe to grind to get back at Mr. Franken in the simplest, most mundane, one-note fashion possible. A complete waste of time and effort. There should be a lot more ""there"" there. Unfortunately when you simply don't care for someone...it's hard to fill 300 pages with anything substantial, and this book proves just that."
1,Skorski LIES,"And he lies stupidly.Two other reviewers have already pointed out the laughably inept appearance by this douchebag on Carlson's show, and how easy it was to prove that FRANKEN was RIGHT ON THE MONEY on the minimum-wage claim, and both this moron and his idol, Limbaugh, were simply lying.I checked it myself: The reviewers got it right, Skorski is a pathetic douchebag, and this ""book"" is excrement.Read it at your peril."
1,Terrible,"Angered at Frankens irritating habit of pointing out the lies, exaggerations and smears by the ultra right wing ""christo-fascist zombie brigade"", Skorski decided to sit down and give Franken a taste of his own medicine. Sadly for him he has zilch.Did Al miss the mark in a handful of the hundreds of examples he used? Yes. Does Skorski utterly fail with this stinker? You bet."
1,A long slog on a tedious subject,"Having read a couple of Franken's books, I have come to the conclusion that not only is he boring to read, he's even more boring to read about. With all due respect to the author, this book will change no one's mind, either negative or positive, about Franken. Relax, take another sip of kool-aid and move on to other material more suitable to your political persuasion."
1,Pure baloney,"I have read this book. I tried to give Mr. Skorski the benefit of the doubt. I could not. It is so poorly written, so unbelievably biased, that one only winces in embarassment for poor Mr. Skorski.I expect this book to be sold in the ""remainder"" piles for a fraction of it's published price. Even then, don't waste your money. Unless, of course, you like to laugh at the misfortune of some people who call themselves ""authors""."
1,Deserves no star,"this is simply an insipid attempt to disparage and detract the reputation of Franken, but it is not convincing. In fact it is nothing more than a bunch of bovine literary dross."
1,don't buy,If you saw the tard who wrote this stinker on Tuckers show the other night you won't. I never heard of this bozo but with the sweat and red face you could tell he was lying. 2 chapters on the Polk award? wow. I smell Pulitzer. Why don't these guys debate Franken. Scared of face to face. Chickenhawks
1,Git your whinin' lyin' here by Skorski,Skorski both lies AND whines! He couldn't -- and therefore didn't -- debunk a single claim made by Franken! What a waste!
1,Just to help you out,"When I heard about this book, I was extremely curious. I had read and enjoyed Franken's ""Liars"" book and wondered if I had been hoodwinked. Then I saw Mr. Skorski on Tucker Carlson on which he stated concerning Robert Reno's March 8th 2001 Newsday column criticizing Bill O'Reilly that, ""after I saw the article, I said, this doesn't say anything that Franken claimed it did."" So I bought the article myself on Newsday's website. And I looked over that chapter of Franken's book. Reno's article says just what Franken said it says in his book. Buy the article yourself if you don't believe me (it's on Newsday's website). Don't buy this book."
1,Not good promotion,"This jagbag was on Tucker Carlson's show the other night. Tucker asked him two things about how Al Franken lied. He was wrong on both points!1) O'Reilly really did say he won a Peabody award, then said ""So I called a Polk a Peabody, big deal"". See, even Bill admits it.2) The author said that Al is wrong about minimum wage. He agrees with Rush that minimum wage is mostly made up of teenage workers. The 2004 result - 24.9 percent are 16-19. That means that 75 percent are over 20!If you can't get your facts right, you lose the argument.Can anyone write a book now a days??"
1,Horrible,"This is this worst piece of trash that was ever written. It is full of lies, deceit, and the author is an opportunistic fascist!! Facts obviously don't matter to him, and hopefully it will catch up with him and not many books will be purchased."
1,I'm chuckling....,"Amazingly, some reviewers automatically believe THIS guy in THIS book, thereby trashing Franken. So, who knows? Apparently NO ONE is telling the truth!"
5,Franken Busted,"I just received my copy from Amazon on Saturday, better late than never.I haven't finished it yet, but the table of contents alone, tell you that Alan Skorski has spent a great deal of time monitoring and researching Al Franken.The whole Peabody/Polk award controversy that Franken built his reputation on is completley dissected by Skorski. His 2 chapters on the subject, include a number of emails between Skorski and Franken, with Franken admitting that he never bothered to read the news column he cited to blast O'Reilly as a pathological liar.In another chapter I skimmed through, Skorski makes a strong point that Franken's USO Tours are nothing more than props for Franken to say, ""see, I'm more patriotic than you are"" even as Franken mocks and undermines our troops when he gets back on US soil.I'd be interested in reading other reviews, provided they give specific examples of what they liked or didn't like."
1,Skorski is begging to get in to Biush Baby Club,"This book is so simplistic it seems like a senior thesis that got a ""C"" and the author just passed on because he's hopeless. You can skim the book in the bookstore and get all you need from it to understand where Skorski is coming from. He's trying to suck up to the Rush Limbaugh far right-wing. Just another light weight trying to get atention as a basher."
4,"Well Done, Maybe overdone","I only gave Pants on Fire 4 stars instead of 5, because I think that he just did too much.It is obvious that Skorski took his research responsiblities seriously enough to document every single transgression committed by Franken.Half way through the book, there is no doubt that Franken has pulled the wool over everybody's eyes - everybody except for Skorski, that is.This is more of an encyclopedia of every lie and smear ever told by Franken.I would have given him 5 stars had he made the book a little shorter.For conservatives who are fed up with Franken, this book is a must read.For ""honest"" liberals, this is a must read as well. Regardless of ideology, nobody likes being lied to.For Franken sycophants, this book is going to hurt."
1,No match for Franken,"When will the right wing find a political commentator who is a match for a comedian? This book doesn't even belong in the same library. skorski [sic] couldn't hold Franken's jockstrap in politics, comedy or writing a readable book.My idiot brother-in-law threw this book at me to prove Franken was wrong. I can't wait to discuss the book with him."
1,Weak,"I've seen some of Skorski's reputed Franken ""lies"" online, and caught him on Tucker Carlson. This guy has got *nothing*. He is obviously a sycophant, and he ain't that sharp. And I think that Ann Coulter, for example, as much as I dislike her, is quite clever."
1,Brilliant! Check out these other books:,"No Revolution: How the Left Conspired Against Christianity to Give Us The Round Earth Theory by Alan Skorski""Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah!"": Rhetoric For The 21st Century by Alan SkorskiMiracle! How Dr. Seuss Revolutionized Medicine by Alan SkorskiAd Hominem Ad Nauseum by Alan SkorskiTen Habits Of Highly-Ineffective Opportunistic Right-Wing Shills by Alan Skorski (Foreword by Ann Coulter)Holy Bible by Alan Skorski and Bill O'ReillyThis one is my personal favorite, and while it is true that some dispute the fact that Skorski and O'Reilly wrote The Bible these people clearly have not read the BLS report which says they did. You hear that, Franken! Stuff that in your pipe and smoke it!Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to rescue Christmas."
1,Highly recommended reading for someone who wants a good laugh.,i heard about this book yesterday so i went to barnes and noble to-day and read it for about an hour. i was laughing out loud as i went through it. Skorski misses the point of what franken says and missrepresents what he is saying everywhere. He claims that franken is contradicting himself when really it is only Skorski's incorrect interpretation of what Franken is saying that is being contradicted. I reccomend this book to anyone who has read Al Franken before just because the points are laughable. Any thinking individual should be able to turn to a page and chuckle at the off target text.
1,"The hypothesis this book proves,","in fact, the only one, is this...Conservatives like this dope Skorski are bullies and liars...that's the only way they're able to ""prove"" their points...I mean, this pile (...) ain't even anywhere near the general vicinity of truth...Moe-rons who actually believe this load of non-literate tripe masquerading as a book (it least it has a cover and pages inside), should tune in to the Colbert Report and get a truth-o-ution!"
1,"Buy Charmin, it's softer toilet paper",It's not surprising the people who rated this highly didn't actually read the book. It's just a piece of crap by an idiot.
5,Brilliant,Well written.Well researched.Eye-opening expose about Al Franken.I was both surprised and disappointed to find out the extent of deceipt Al Franken commits. A must read for anybody.
5,Love this shoe!,"Fit was very true to size for me, especially with my stubby toes. Very comfortable, and tres cute."
4,Very Cute Indeed,"The main reason for putting off watching this movie was lack of a child visitor in the house. With the arrival of my 3-year-old niece, we've been catching up on 'family' films.I had pretty neutral expectations of this movie only to find my level of satisfaction rather high at the end.It reminded me a great deal of 'The Brave Little Toaster' from back in the day, but is otherwise a classic tale of a motley crew finding friendship and making their way home again.To be sure, Rhino was the sneak-away star of the movie, but that in no way diminishes the other animal characters.We were quoting Bolt on styrofoam, Mittens on the power of doggy begging, and the pigeons (good fun there) on aliens for days after.Highly recommend this movie as a fun family night. Kids of all ages can enjoy it."
3,GOOD & BAD,"1st off good movie. 3d has a bit of cross talking early on, then smooths out (well documented, it's not the equipment). Goes from poor to great 3d especially early on. Okay."
5,This is what I expect 3D to be!,"Fun,fun, fun!!! You can reach out an touch the cartoon. Well almost. Things zooming past, jumping out at you its great!"
5,Bolt in 3D :Out of the screen,"I just loved to see this little dog`s big action in BIG. A great lesson from man`s best friend ,friendship is forever."
4,Great little movie. My daughter loves it!,Not much else to say. My daughter loves it. Trust loyalty and friendship. Great lessons for little ones. I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly.
3,Mass Produced Fun,Another very good movie.. one of my son's favorites.. I have been forced to watch it so many times it makes me sick. Get addicted at your own peril. =)
3,Lightning fast movie...not really,"I found myself wondering how quickly the end would come...overall it is an okay movie to watch once and especially not a bad movie for kids, but it missed the mark with me. I wanted to Bolt from watching it in its entirety, but stayed to the end."
2,BOLT 4 PACK,"The 3D blueray, blueray & DVD worked fine but there was no product ID # to install the Digital Copy to my computer. What a Bummer!"
2,"""Like New"" - ""REALLY?""","The seller stated ""Like new"". Well the blue-ray disc started having problems right away at the beginning of the movie and wont even play in the PS3. There was no code for the digital copy! I ordered printer ink at the same time, it took 4 or 5 days for my ink to reach me and 7 days for this DVD. I called Disney and they are going to help me rectify the problem's of the blue-ray disc. They already helped me with the digital code.I don't consider these problem ""Like New""."
4,Bolt,"Bolt was a family film full of adventure. A little predictable, but very humorous and thrilling. The relationship between the cat and Bolt is priceless. To see a cat teach a dog be a dog was worth the price of the film. The hamster had a great part and really added that little something to help the story along. I would suggest anyone to see this especially if you love cats and dogs."
5,Bolt is a Hit,"My 3 year old loves this movie! He wants to watch it over and over again! I'd recommend it. The first time I watched it, I didn't get into it. Now, I really like it."
4,all age entertainment,This is a family movie that all must see. A Disney movie that could stand up with the best Disney animated features. An ( A ) in my book.
4,as advertised,"Perfect condition, shipped fast. Seems the movie was a one shot viewing for grandkids 7 and 3, go figure. Blu ray some what over rated on some movies, this is one."
4,Bolt,We got this in the time allowed and in great shape. My granddaughter loves this movie. I have already watched it several times with her and I am sure I will watch it several more. :)
4,Bolt is a 3d keeper,"Like a lot of you,if you have the 3d hook-up,you'll most likely give most anything a 3d try.A lot of times i've just traded them in for store credits,knowing full well I would never watch them again.I was pleasantly suprised with Bolt !! Great animation,good story about a cute dog(Bolt)and really good 3d made this a ""keeper"" that I will watch again."
5,Wonderful,My children absolutely love this movie. They have seen it many times and they don't get tired of watching it. It's fun and creative with some unexpected bits that just create a wonderful movie for children and adults alike. We highly recommend it!
4,"Great Movie, Lousy Extras","First of all the movie was fantastic plenty action, wonderful comedy and a huge amount of heart. The bonus features unfortunately leave something to be desired, the longest featurette doesn't even last 10 minutes and the lack of a commentary is almost unforgivable. The Rhino short starts off entertaining but ends up just catering to Hannah Montana fan girls. The best feature is probably the deleted scenes which, though only storyboards, are quite interesting."
4,funny!,"A funny movie but not really for toddlers, there are scenes that were boring to young ones. I guess kids 8 and up will enjoy this one. That hamster is so cute."
5,"Call him Lightning! ""Bolt"" is here on Blu Ray in a 3 disc set that includes the Blu Ray,a DVD and a Digital Copy!","Just picked up my copy,a great three disc Blu Ray release from Disney,you get Bolt on Blu Ray,A digital copy for devices like Ipod's,and a DVD for the car or wherever you dont have a Blu Ray player,with all three versions,you can play the movie pretty much anywhere! A great Disney film! Fun for the whole family! Recommended! A+"
3,Entertaining,"Animated Disney movie that has fun with a 'Truman Show' plot, except Truman in this case is a dog who's whole life is based around a TV show in which he stars. This was another movie that was perfect for an plane ride, and it had enough adult humor to keep me entertained throughout."
3,Poor Cat,My granddaughter and I went to see this movie. She liked it all. I liked most of it. I think the fire was scary.And I think there was cruelty to the cat: Bolt the dog dangled her over the freeway to make her confess. And then dragged her along the street by a leash.So I will not buy the DVD for this reason.
2,MISSING DISCS,"THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH THE REGULAR COPY AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL FEATURES DISC. IT ONLY CAME WITH THE BLU RAY COPY, WHICH COULD ONLY MEAN TWO THINGS, 1 THEY KEPT THE OTHER DISC AND SOLD IT OR THAT THEY DIDNT KNOW THE DISCS WERE MISSING. ONE SAD LITTLE CHILD LATER (BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A BLU RAY PLAYER IN THE CAR) AND NO RESPONSE FROM THE SELLER.DISAPPOINTED"
2,Okay for one or two times,"This was a fairly cute cartoon movie....my disk was faulty, so had to go to ""chapters"" to see it all. It was worth the effort, once, maybe twice, but not more than that. Not bad for younger audience, but not as good as some previous animated movies like ""Nemo""."
2,2 childish 4 me,this movie was 2 childish 4 me. you can predict basically wat is going to happen because it is obvious that bolt will save....i am 12 years old and i reccomend this to 5-10 year olds
2,BOLT BLU RAY DVD,BORING AND POOR CG ANIMATION COMPARED WITH PIXAR GREAT FILMS....AN ANIMATED TOON WITH A LOT OF AGRESSIVE MESSAGE.....BETTER WAIT FOR SNOW WHITE AND FANTASIA IN BLU RAY
2,Bolt away from the TV.,"What could have been a totally awesome 10 minute movie, just becomes another slow-paced, boring jaunt through the adventures of a dog, cat, and hamster. There were a few fun parts here and there. The cat's voice was extremely irritating, I was happy when she was out of the picture, only to return near the end, ugh. The dog was cute though. For adults, a little more imagination, storyline, and better dialogue may have helped this one; however, this is geared towards children. Enjoy.;)~"
2,Not for little kids!,"I would have given this a higher rating if it wasn't supposed to be geared toward kids. My six year old daughter was scared and sad during parts of this movie, crying uncontrolably during the fire scene. Parents beware. Now that being said, I liked the movie but it is not for little kids. I think Disney could have toned some of this down a bit."
4,fun movie,"My 4 year old boy loves this movie! It's pretty fun, keeps you entertained. Good humor and cure story. I am glad we bought it for our road trip, we had fun."
4,I liked it. My child was a bit scared at times.,"This is a great change from having to watch the typical girl-oriented fairy tale. That being said, the plot might be too complicated for a very small child. I would recommend it for someone in the first grade or older."
5,Sweet movie about loyalty and friendship,Got this for my 5 y.o. son who LOVES it! It's got some cute humor for the whole family too.
4,Top notch Hollywood entertainment,"""Bolt"" is top notch Hollywood entertainment, and many movies in one. It's a cool spy action movie, with great explosions and chases. It's a buddy road trip, with adventure and humor. It's Lassie, showing the strong bond between a kid and her dog. In short, ""Bolt"", much like ""The Incredibles"", has nearly everything I hope for in a movie: action, heart, and laughs. There was much more to it than I saw in the trailers and TV ads. I thought this movie would be significantly inferior to a Pixar movie, but it turned out to be nearly as good. I would expect this movie to have universal appeal, with its cute and lovable characters. It looks and sounds pristine on Blu-ray. The extras are very short, but include a nice extra cartoon with one of the characters from the movie. Most extras are the standard behind the scenes footage. Reviewed 4/20/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
5,Tons of bass,"This movie is a great family favorite, at least for mine it is. My girls range from 13 - 11 - 2 years old, they all love it. My wife and I enjoy it as well.Video is awesome on blu-ray, doesn't get much better than this. And if you've got a sub woofer, get ready for some sonic booms, this sound track carries a ton of bass."
1,"I really wanted to like it, but I can't ignore the subtext","I really wanted to like Bolt. I like most of these types of films. And why not, it is well made with excellent animation, and competent cast, excellent production values, cute characters etc. But the trouble for me is that I just can't get past the horrible message and subtext of this movie. The dog is essentially abused by his owners. And the movie is essentially about the unwaveringly loyal dog returning to his tormentors. I'm really surprised that more people don't have a problem with that the way I do (being an animal lover)."
5,Totally exceeded expectations,"Totally exceeded expectations, can watch it over and over and over, very heartwarming, reminds kids they are important."
5,Great movie,"This is my child's favorite movie. Also, product arrived in excellent condition just as merchant described."
5,A Great Film,"Simone Signoret will break your heart! She deservedly won an Oscar for one of the all time great performances ever given by any actress. She is simply devastating. Matched all the way by Laurence Harvey, alternately cruel and callous and then warm and tender. Their scenes together ring true and are timeless depictions of deep emotional and sexual intimacy. The other themes of the film, class distinctions etc. are still valid...but it will be Simone, touching the heart of this callow young man and making him better for it, feeling their age difference yet unable to stop herself from loving and hoping for happiness against her own experience, that will haunt you. A shattering film masterpiece."
5,Room at the Top,"Based on John Braine's cynical novel, one of the first ""angry young man"" tales, Clayton's brilliant social drama is distinguished by sharp, biting dialogue and sexually explicit language unusual for its time. It's also a lacerating critique of the British class system that's lost none of its punch. Laurence Harvey's Joe makes a credible central character, but it's Signoret who holds your attention, and breaks your heart, as Alice. The gifted French actress won an Oscar for her sensitive portrayal."
3,Room at the Top,"An excellent movie with very good actors. Simone Signoret received an Oscar for her performance.Unfortunately, the sound track of the new DVD that we watched,is of very poor quality. You can hear noises that sound like air bubbles in a water tank, which takes the enjoyment out of watching the movie."
4,Room At The Top,"I have been attempting to purchase ""Room At The Top"" for several years, and was told that it was in the Archives! But I was really pleased to find this film on Amazon. I would highly recommend very interesting 50's film for not only the acting, but also the social mores that were so well conveyed. Great casting, cinematography, and superb acting. Hopefully, some day Criterion will fine tune this great flick!"
1,A bad design can cost you lots....,"I am about to buy my third AC power supply for my Dell Inspiron Notebook. It will cost $47.50. It is not a part that you think of as needing replacement every year, but the design is so poor that it happens. Simply put, the two piece adapter's cord splits or breaks apart at the connector sites on both sides. If you buy the Dell Notebook, you have to remember to treat this cord very carefully - it is not as sturdy as the Notebook is. Maddening. A rip off. Designed to decline. UGHHH."
1,Hi Capacity 90 Watt AC Adapter,I thought that I would try purchasing a cheaper product for my Dell Inspiron laptop other than the battery supplied from Dell since the customer reviews and ratings on that product were horrible..... big mistake. This knock-off didn't even last a month and I still paid $50 for it. I have to contort and move the wire countless times and directions in order for it to work (maybe.) I would not suggest this product to anyone and my solution to this ridiculous battery problem was to purchase a mac :)Now I couldn't be happier.
1,Piece of garbage,"This thing is a ripoff as it is very poor quality andliterally tears in two much like a cardboard box would.In fact, you would be better off tearing up a cardboardbox to roll your chair around on these things are so lightweight and flimsy. Dont waste your money or time!"
4,Re: Economy Weight Chair Mat,"It is a couple of months since I bought this plastic mat for my 6-wheeled office chair. So far so good! It looks durable and I expect it to last a couple of years, if not more. I would recommend this model of mat to anyone. I am a satisfied customer for this mat."
3,OK,"High Spirits is alright, but somewhat dated now due to its genre, due to the appearance of Harry Potter type films. The effects age this production, but it is still a charmer."
5,no kidding,this album might be one of the most depressing and insanely bleak selections ive ever heard. not to mention that one of the tracks is an orchestrated version of Chopin's Funeral March. buy this album but be prepared to want to quit life.
1,lost masters should get lost,"Number 1: The first 3 songs are cut off at the beginning.Number 2: Several cuts are from scratchy 45'sNumber 3: The use of the word ""masters"" is ludicrousNumber 4: The 3 alternate takes are NOT alternate takesNumber 5: How did this CD get even 1 star?"
3,Great performance disappointing remaster,Chesky's remaster of Earl Wild's recording of the Grieg Piano Concerto is gorgeous - warm and detailed. The Rachmaninov remasters however are stripped bare - they're too clean. Piano sound is good but the orchestra sounds old and shrill because the warmth has gone. Surprising and disappointing. The Chandos remasters actually sound better (and all the concertos and rhapsody are on 2CDs). Performance of course is brilliant.
1,Where are all the parts to the kite? Didnot come with it,"I am at the beach, and I was ready to use the kite for the first time flying the RedBaron kite. The kite did not come with the fiberglass spars to put the kite together. I would like a complete kite. Where is the the rest of my kite? I would appreciate the company to send me the missing parts to the kite. They should also have better quality assurance of their products before selling it to the public."
4,Fun but slightly impractical,"This kite is fantastic if you want to hum terrorizing music while antagonizing other kites, or imagine that you're a flying ace.I would be wary of other reviews claiming that this kite can fly in ""light wind"". Sadly, 3 wings doesn't give you 3x the lift of a single wing on a plane, in reality it's closer to 120% or 130%.With that in mind, I'd say this is more of a special (windy) occasion kite than an everyday kite. Worth waiting for the right wind conditions!"
4,Justice League... with no Women! Come on!,"I love Batman... or The Batman, but to have the Justice League without Wonder Woman is a sin!The special feature say that they wanted to get the characters that were some personification of an aspect of the Batman,soI guess there is no Femininity to The Batman. The series got it right with Batgirl being a partner before Robin, but there wasn't a way to include one Woman Leaguer?Anyway, the stories were still entertaining, but had the final season feel to them.You know the final season feel, right?They tried something new, then tried to go back to the basics, but then gave up and summed up everything in the final two episodes with everything feeling finished.Yeah, I have no clue what the final season 'feels' like, but this season made me think I 'felt' it."
5,We own all five seasons on DVD...,"and really enjoy watching all of them. Batman entertains my three and five year olds and it's good enough that my husband and I can watch it without getting bored. Happy kids, happy parents, it's win/win."
5,"great company, great plant","i purchased this vine hoping it would grow in the heat down here (tucson, az) and it's done amazing! it arrived very healthy for sitting in a box by my front door for a day. waited a few days to plant since i didn't have the time and just gave it a little water every day, it stayed very healthy.i planted using miracle grow soil and it's done remarkable. after about one to two weeks it already has another vine stem that's as long and healthy as the first! we're averaging over 100 degrees every day and it's thriving, i just have it hooked up to my drip system. great plant and i can't wait to see it bloom."
5,Beautiful!,"Most gorgeous flowers I've ever seen! I admit I bought it as a gift for my dad, but man, they are beautiful! I love it! It's also a remarkably resilient & fast-growing plant!Received the item as advertised, no problems. Highly recommended!"
4,Hope it grows,"Bought it hoping to get the plant in the ground for fall. Came fast and well packed, though a little smaller than I had hoped. Tending it and am hoping it can establish itself before winter or it may have to be indoors. Probably getting a living plant in the spring would have been a better idea."
3,Never flowered,"Vine took off and was all over the place, but I never once saw it flower, which is why I got the product. I did all the research and provdided the plant with what it needed, but no show."
1,Did not survive the transplant,"I've never ordered a live plant on-line before so I though I would give it a try. Well, the plant arrived inside a box wrapped in newspaper. The seedling was very small. I put it in ground immediately and watered it. But the plant died after a few days. Fifteen dollars down the drain, I don't think I would buy plants on-line again."
2,Miramax - get your facts straight!,"All three of these volumes claim to contain versions of their respective movies that are ""Enhanced for 16x9 televisions"" yet upon closer examination, each of the volumes contains at least one (and in the case of Volume III, TWO) movies that are in the same crappy matted widescreen format that Miramax has been pushing for the last several years. The culprit in the this volume is Life is Beautiful. I have nothing against widescreen - just let the DVD player insert the matting and use the full resolution of the DVD for useful picture information. I suspect these box sets are a way for Miramax to dump the older (non anamorphic widescreen) versions of these movies on unsuspecting 4x3 t.v. owners - chances are they'll never know the difference until they try to watch them on a newer 16x9 t.v. - at which time it will be too late to return them."
4,Great DIY shirts!,"These are wonderful! You just print anything you want to transfer and then iron them on. You have your custom shirt under 10 minutes!! The only drawback is that they transfer together with the white background unlike the ones for white fabric (So, remember *not* to flip your image when you print!). So you need to trim the print out carefully not leaving a border. Similarly, if you want to print text, you may want to print them in a backgrund box. Using it is super-easy. Just make sure you are using a 100% cotton fabric, that's all.Note: All you people with transfer problems, do make sure you strip the backing off after printing and use just the transfer and the 'cover' sheet for iron on!"
2,waste of time and money!!,"first of all, it took FOREVER to get the trsfers to stick to the t-shirts, then, they only give you one of those papers to go between each transfer and the iron which meant that once each one started getting sticky, I had no choice but to keep using it therefore RUINING the shirts. Maybe it was just user error, but this isn't the first time I've done T-shirt trasnfers, yet only two out of the included 6 actually came out right. Avery trasfers are far easier to use (I just wish they didn't leave the tea-stain effect). All in all, these have proven to be hit or miss with me, and they're too pricey to be going through trial and error."
5,I use them in my professional heat press,"These transfer are really a lot more than what I expected. Although the instructions are guided for home iron print; in a professional heat transfer press, heating at 375 Farenheit for 20 seconds with medium hard pressure gives me great results. I strongly recomend this."
1,impossible,"I've tried these transfers several times on several different types of fabrics and they simply do not work. I've been disappointed every time, after following the directions to the letter. The image did not transfer no matter how hot the iron and how much pressure I applied. Ruined a couple t-shirts in the process.Also, hp printing software will flip the image horizontally when you select ""iron-on transfer"" in printing properties, so if you have already flipped your image in the document, when you print onto the transfer paper the image will have flipped BACK without warning. I wasted several sheets of this paper dealing with that problem."
4,"Useful for designing your own things, if they are squares","This product works like it says. You print an image on a standard printer, place a piece of tissue like paper (it comes in the package) over it, and iron on per instructions. Not good for scroll print, or small lettering etc. It is great for putting a large graphic with straight edges or subtly rounded/wavy edges. Overall I like it, just not as versatile as advertised."
1,did not work for me,"Did not stick on anything I tried, even I followed the instructions carefully. Ended up using iron-on transfers intended for white fabrics instead, which is much better solution (even for colored fabrics)"
2,Wrong product shipped,I needed this product for LIGHT COLORED fabrics. This is only for DARK COLORED fabrics. I did not return the product because I might use it in the future.The product DESCRIPTION on Amazon.com is ERRONEOUS!
1,Won't feed through my HP printer,"Waste of money. will not feed through my HP printer, even though all other paper and Avery iron on transfers print just fine. HP support no help. total loss."
5,Richard Scarry and Trains--Perfect Combination!,"This is a darling book, full of delightful detail that Richard Scarry is known for! I bought it for our grandchild (17 mo.) but will save it until he's a little older and gentler with books. There are fold-outs on one side and complete illustrations on the back side so that it would be perfect for storytelling with a small group of children!"
4,good storyline but not many flaps,The storyline is great and a nice idea that the full train opens up displaying each car; but some pages have no flaps on them at all. Lift the flap books are great but need to have more than just a handful of flaps; especially for a R.Scarry book; kids that like those are into detail and to only put a handful of flaps on there kind of shortchanges it.
2,Outdated and dangerous - waste of money.,"As the mother of a 5 month old and a 23 month old, I thought this book might be a good mix of ideas for both my girls. The few SAFE ideas presented are things my 23 month old did in her first year. There was nothing new presented and nothing that seemed applicable to her now at almost 2. That said, the baby ideas were a bit on the dangerous side. The book suggests tying toys in the babies crib which seems to create a choking hazard. It also reccommends walkers for babies. Walkers have been strongly advised against by the AAP for years now. Lastly, the book suggests using planks of wood to create a gym in your living room. I don't keep planks of wood around, let along ones that are sanded & varnished with rounded corners. Overall this book was a complete waste of money."
3,great scholarship but poor presentation,"if you are already a scholar in sanskrit, fine, this is for you. But there is no glossary or editorial context to help the nonscholar...obviously great scholarship in the translation and presentation (judging from Thurman's intro) but this series would greatly benefit from consideration of adding a glossary and editorial notes. Otherwise this is for academic libraries only."
2,tootsie roll aren't what they used to be!,i bought these thinking they weren't as giant as they were and gave most of them away. i suppose because of the fact that corn syrup is used now instead of sugar is why they WILT...but tootsie rolls don't have the charm they used to have for me. I probably won't purchase them again.
4,Best Cookbook I ever used,"I ordered a copy of the one I had used for years, that began to fall apart. Over the years, the recipes in the original were used so often that I wanted to replace it. It's perfect, thank you."
3,Elegant watch but so so movement quality,"I received this watch 5 years ago as a birthday gift. I like the classical design of this watch and initially i liked the fact that it is a automatic watch and fairly lightweight and slim at that. I found that after a few month of operation the movement went slower and slower. After 2 years I lost a couple of minutes every day which is just unacceptable for a timepiece. I sent it to Tissot and the repair cost me about 130$. I did have it repaired mostly because the watch had emotional value. Now two years later the watch starts to go slow again.I agree that the PR50 is cheap for the apparent build quality but the movement does not seem to live up to the quality I expect from a Swiss watch. I have another Tissot watch since the early 90's with a quartz movement (as well as other mechanical watches from other brands) that I could wholeheartedly recommend, just not this model."
3,sloooow,"Everything seems to be slower (powerbook with 1ghz processor, 1gb memory). Fairly frequent system hangs, printer no longer functionsYou get the idea. Wait for version 1. Apple should have."
2,Spotlight doesn't work with MS Word files+!,"Organizing my research files which were typed into multiple MSWord docs over the years was THE ONLY REASON I wanted 10.4. Now I find that ""Spotlight"" is choosey about which Word files it indexes--apparently. I did all the required tests; I opened docs, found odd words or names, and then Spotlighted them. At first it seemed promising. Many docs were indexed until I noticed that many older ones still in earlier versions of Word were not. I updated them to Word X and that seemed to work. But, I found, it DID NOT work for all updated Word files. Now I am not sure what IS and IS NOT indexed. Other docs including Pagemaker and Freehand also have this problem--this is hardly what Mac advertised Spotlight to be. I just bought an engine-less car!"
2,Not worth the upgrade from Panther,"This operating system is great, but the features that make OS X great were already there. I rushed out to get this upgrade from Apple the day it was released and have been very disappointed.Don't get me wrong, this is a great piece of software, but after the long upgrade process, I feel like I got the great things about my Mac back.Spotlight seems interesting, but does seem super useful just yet. The gadgets look very cool, but are only things that look very cool.I suggest waiting a while to upgrade. You don't get iLife and there is nothing that huge in it like the upgrade to Jaguar. Sorry"
1,DVD to buy a CD!!,"Upgrade to Mac / Tiger and you have to buy the DVD to do so. But, if you only have a CD - R or CD - RW, then you have the 'privilege' of spending even more dosh to get a CD version from Apple.Is it just me or is this not quite right eh!!Perhaps when I have eventually installed the CD version, I shall be rating this higher."
2,Do not purchase until major bugs have been worked out !!!!!,"Simply put: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS UPGRADE UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH FRUSTRATING BUGS ! All software can have minor glitches, but this upgrade has entirely upset my system to the point of constant restarts, Mail program freezes and Safari eating up system memory. I'm sure YOU have solutions, but please look at the apple support forums to get an idea of how buggy this OS is! Buy it when the price goes down, or when apple properly acknowledges the problem... beware!"
4,Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger,When I bought it I supposed was last edition ...but there was already two updated ( 10.4.2). Very good item but I believe the price is too high for what it really worth.
4,oh apple,"tiger works pretty well. but it seems that whenever apple releases an update, old problems from previous versions are fixed but a new set arrives. it's a vicious cycle. but honestly, tiger really improved my computer's performance. it boots up faster, safari doesn't quit as often. it's bliss. but what is the deal with the iTunes widget?? it has an annoying delay. it's quicker to just open up iTunes or select next track by right clicking on iTunes in the dock. they'll fix this i hope. widgets are so cool. spotlight is cool... in theory. it does what it says it will but i don't care about finding things super fast on my computer anyways. i'm so desperately lonely."
2,Very annoying...,"I'm a longtime Mac user and this is by far the most annoying 'upgrade'. Spotlight alone makes me so angry I want to scream *&^%$!!! If you're working in a production environment and have to switch a number of drives back and forth you'll not be happy with this horrible software automatically trying to index the volumes... and there's no way to turn it off!!!! Spotlight also lacks some of the functionally of the previous find. As for being faster, I'm not seeing it. After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, BBEdit all run slower... much slower. Widgets... annoying bs to eat up cycles, but at least you can turn them off. On the up side Xcode is running better (thank you). Also there is now a halfway decent dictionary application.Over all, two steps forward and three back."
1,I'm not realy amazed,"I thought it was a new big update, like from OS 9 to OS 10, but It's not really something that is worth the money. Sorry.It has some fun features but if you are a professional it's not a must. I can see that the widgets are fun, and the automate is, well it's there. Nothing I really can't live with out."
2,Consider Saving Your Money,"If you make a living with your Mac, then this upgrade is not necessary. Widgets and Spotlight offer nothing to the experienced user. It is very likely there are a number of new handy features that are useful for professionals but there is no way to know because the upgrade does not ship with any useful documentation.If you use your Mac to surf the net and generally play around you will find this upgrade a fun new addition to your computer experience.Regardless of the decision you make you will eventually be required to upgrade your OS due to compatibility issues (old operation systems will eventually slow you down)."
4,Worked out well,The software was just what I need to upgrade my Mac. The box was not in English but the software installation gave an English option so all worked out.
4,If you have panther don't bother!,"I'm reviewing how this worked on an iBook.While this new OS is a upgrade from panther its not a major one in anyway. If you do have panther on your computer now I wouldn't worry about this to much. However there are slight improvements in it.I have noticed since installing it that I get a better signal from my router, I'm not sure what could have caused that but it is pretty significant. I've also noticed that my iBook is running faster but hotter. As for Dashboard, I found that its actually pretty useful for most things. Its actually much more useful and handy than konfabulator was. Ofcourse its not without flaws, for example; you can't use the widgets out of the dashboard screen. Last but not least; the OS doesn't match. The menu bar is a white plasticy gel look and the windows are still brushed metal."
2,Not nearly as stable as 10.2,I upgrade from 10.2.8. 10.4 takes longer to load and crashes a lot-about 15 times in the week i've had it. 10.2 never crashed. If I wanted an OS to do that I would have bought a Widows POC
1,"Don't know, never got!","The box was empty, not what I paid for so I returned it. How could anyone send an empty box. That's wrong! Bad business!"
5,For those who want to savor something hot and smooth.,"Marshal and Snooky were surely heaven sent to play together. As a testimony to Marshal's perfection, he was still making notes on his sheet music just prior to his death a couple of years ago. And Snooky has never sounded better. Between them, they had close to a hundred years of experience at the time of pressing this record. Personally, I have had the pleasure of both artists playing at my home on several occasions, and their legacy is more than the music.When we listen to this masterpiece we experience the perfection that comes after decades of playing together and answering each others questions before being asked. You will delight in Snooky and Marshal and realize what a wonderful treasure their music has always been."
3,Anything goes...,"The book begins with the graphic description of the murder of a woman. I found this description far too gory and detailed, and, above all, useless, in context to the narrative as a whole. The following chapters are the diaries of the fictional Otto Gast which are apparently meant to implicate and prove the existence of a certain Rose Clephane, a party to the above mentioned murder. These diaries ensue as a series of intriguing stories but have absolutely nothing to with the above murder. Otto Gast's mad invention and insane confabulation are a suite of non-sequeters. Unfortunately, the author screams his intention far too loudly: surrealism and ambiguity. Anything goes. I would suggest a little more subtlety and a smoother transition. Obviously Mr. Raff has a great talent, I look forward to more accomplished works as I am sure they will be brilliant.Would be interested to hear the author's views on this book..."
2,Complete lack of narrative substance,"The premise for the ""premises"" is extremely weak, seeming more of a feeble excuse than a reason for the ensuing chapters. Each chapter is enticing and well written however the book would have been a better read as a collection of short stories. The weak and grasping premise of the novel rendered the read in its entirety, contrived. The author is highly talented but the writing seemed to be more of an expression of his ego rather than the creation of a valid literary work."
5,the dragon kings,"The story of a generation of decendants from ancient guardians of japan. They're 4 brothers who learn they have great potentials as their ancestors and when the time is right they can transform into magnificient dragons each with a unique speciality of the four elements. This is a great film for anyone who's a fan of anime. Contains great action sequences, suspense and a bit of comedy. A must see for anime fans!"
1,More liberal trash,"Just another hand wringing, the-sky-is-falling piece of literary debris. It is really unfortunate that the authors found it necessary to prostitute their children's book characters to the gun-grabbers. Save your money, buy some ammo instead."
2,A footnote to history is sometimes there for a reason.,The rise of the KKK in the 1920s is an epic story. However Notre Dame had virtually no role in its downfall. That isn't opinion that's history. The rise and fall of the Klan and the rise and fall of Notre Dame are well worth telling but they aren't really tied together as the book implies. Todd Tucker takes an isolated incident and try to portray it as instrumental in the fall of the KKK's most powerful faction. That is just not true.It's an interesting book for the history of two powerful groups but let's be clear Notre Dame had NOTHING to do with the downfall of the Klan.
4,A Legendary Event in the History of the Fighting Irish,"I am a Notre Dame graduate(class of 1959)and had heard of this clash between the ND student body and KKK, but I knew only the barest details. Therefore, this book was most welcome. It not only covers the 1924 confrontation in almost minute-by-minute detail but serves as a fascinating informal history of both the KKK, especially its post-""Birth of a Nation"" spread in the North, and of the University itself from its 1842 founding date. The book should therefore be fascinating to any ND alum, including those of the subway variety, and would probably be of interest to a general readership was well."
5,"Easy read, great story","Todd Tucker exploits one of the least known storys of the University of Notre Dame in a great way. He doesn't keep it boring, which i have found most other history books to be. It is a very easy read, but not in a bad way at all. I really enjoyed how he also brought in the history of Notre Dame, which i don't think i really would have known otherwise. Also how he talked about the beloved football team. I couldn't asked for anything less."
4,Jovial and enjoyable,"This Opera-bouffe was created to entertain, and that's all it does. The plot could have been a Rossini one with its false identities, amorous intentions, etc. This ""modernized"" production succeeds in adding some spice to the plot and making it a satirical piece of modern Paris life. The aristocratic tittles are somehow out of place, but it doesn't disturb too much. The music and arias are not Offenbach's best, but they are nice and enjoyable. The performers are young, or at least act as young ones, which gives a very fresh and jovial taste to the overall experience. The voices are nice, not incredible, and fit the characters. Not a great opera, but an enjoyable and sometimes funny one. Recommended for his lightness and humor."
5,Wonderful reading!,"When I ordered this book back in 1995, I wanted to know more thanthe history of the US Naval Academy. The Academy's alumni is aWho's Who in American military leadership and command presence.I only wished I had attended Annapolis. Anyone who loves our service academies should not miss the opportunity to buy this wonderful book."
4,good history,"interesting, enjoyable, a wealth of info regarding the history of the naval academy (and some of its illustrious grads)--i would recommend it for anyone interested in finding out more about this institution"
4,Good Shoes,I've had these for about a month and i get lots of complements. they are good shoes and comfortable enough. the price was good too. the fit of the shoes are perfect. i would get another pair if i had to.
3,The Mravinsky Version,"I also bought this Barbirolli interpretation of this Sibelius favorite based on Amazon reviews. I think Santa Fe listener has the most accurate review, ""played raw and with grit"". If you want to hear the Mravinsky version, buy this CD, otherwise I would select Anthony Collins or one of the other high rated performances."
1,Day of the Dead,"Does anyone out there know if this is the soundtrack to the George A Romero film 'Day of the Dead', made 1985. It's the third and hopefully not the last part of George's... eh, trillogy. If that's not a contradiction in terms. Mail me at oliviatracey@hotmail.com"
1,very Uniteresting......,"I have used this book as a supplemental reader in Urban Sociology, not only do I find it to be the worst sociology book I ever read, but it is so boring to read, and very uninteresting, I have read other urban sociology books that capture the readers attention, this book fails to do so. I did not like this one at all. I am suprised it is even in the annual editon series."
5,Wonderful teaching tool,"This book should be used by parents to engage their children both visually and emotionaly about truths of life. The hidden messages in the pictures followed by a story illustration help sink principles deep into the hearts of young & old alike.In Him, Dr. Carl"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this book thinking it was a compilation of Max Lucado's short stories (You are Special, etc) and that's not at all what it was. I never did end up reading it, so it may be a great book but I wouldn't know because I ended up returning it for a few of his individual books."
3,"Not the best Karen Kelley, but decent read","I was waitng for this book to come out after reading Southern Exposure. It wasn't nearly as good as the previous book, but it's still a worthwhile read. The character development isn't as solid and Jessica Nelson will get on your nerves with her I-want-to-be-a-cop, I-don't-want-to-be-a-cop thoughts.Buy it used."
5,The best book on Portland!,"Recently I relocated to the Portland area from California. I bought and received 4-5 different books on ""About Portland"" and this by far was the greatest help. This book helped me determine where I wanted to live, where I want to go on the weekend and where to eat. There is a ton of helpful information on where to go and what to do. It has become my bible for the area. If you are planning to move here or just visit- a great purchase.0...Sept 2002- I still use this book monthly after a year and a half. Can't say enough good about it or how much it has helped me get to know where I live."
5,The reference album of the 80s.,"From the classic Avalon track to the masterpieces of To Turn You On and True To Life, this classic Roxy Music album is truly exceptional. This is Bryan Ferry at his very best."
4,Great Delaware Rock!,"Walleye's Familiar Forgotten is just another example of the outstanding music that is on Jade Tree Records. Walleye carries its small town feel and isolation to create thoughtful music. Walleye's cd set a precedent for all the other emo bands out there to follow. Some songs are slower but there is a good deal of raw emotive rock. A group keenly aware of both its strengths and weeknesses, it manages to bypass most the unpleasant material in older releases. If you want a good history lesson for Jade Tree records, emo and post punk in general, this is a good place to start."
2,Still looking for a good antenna,"The antenna is easy enough to use and install. It also seems to be pretty sturdy. But in terms of receiving channels clearly, I'll pass. I was very disappointed in the bad quality of the few channels I am even getting. Not worth buying!"
2,Doesnt Work,im gonna be real with you this **** dont work its crazy you might wanna consider going to raadioshack or walmart too see one instead of purchasing one onine
4,Practical Advice on California Native Gardening,"This book is essential to any California gardener who wants to learn how to introduce some of California's many beautiful native perennials into his or her garden. Mr. Keator, a guru of native gardening in California, offers practical advice on selection, propagation and culture of the most garden-worthy native perennials. The text is interesting (riveting for native enthusiasts) and well-written. Only the black-and-white line drawings and lack of photos leave the reader wanting more."
2,Convoluted,"The book had some nice ideas that were not developed. How many times must the heroine fall in love, but then fondly realize that it was only lust or convenience? If you want to read most of the same ideas, but with developed characters and steady story lines try Lyn Denison's Dream Lover or Karin Kallmaker's Painted Moon."
3,Enjoyable short story!,Rhythm Tide was a nice couple hours of reading. It was not long and drawn out for the plot itself. I thought the love story could have been touched on a little more but all in all I thought it was a good story. Not a best seller but enjoyable. It is worth the read...especially if you can pick the book up cheap!
4,MASTER OF THE GAME,LOVE THE BOOK AND MOVIE. ONLY WISH IT WAS IN WIDESCREEN AND BLU-RAY. MOVIE IS STILL GREAT. SIDNEY SHELDON ROCKS!!
5,Finally...,"At last the mini series ""master of the game"" is available on dvd.In the likeness of ""woman of substance"", ""hold the dream"" and ""rage of angels"" this mini series are welcome in our dvd collection.Sydney shelton rules..."
2,When bad acting happen to good stories,"OK,it was the 80's, and i guess the standards were not very high. but come on, the story is one of Sidney Sheldon's' best sellersi wished i have not seen it and kept the great memory of the booki hope Hollywood does not crush fans again with lame acting of masterpiece booksshamenadaSaudi Arabia"
5,Master of the Game,I love the TV Mini Sears genre. I had this on VHS tape from when they first aired it. I watched it every several years since.It is so great to see it with no commercials and the color is wonderful.It is a good story covering several generations.
2,I was looking forward to see the whole series but...,"I was so happy to finally getting to see this series again, but I was very disappointed to see that after the brilliant part 1 of it, part 2, 3, and 4 was just a condensed version of the series. The edit is so bad, you just see little pieces after little pieces of the action. I was watching it with a friend that never watched this series before and after the initial interest of part 1, she gives up...bad editing, bad product. Shame on the producer of this DVD, you destroyed a fine series, I feel robbed."
5,Twin Win,"Master of the Game is a win on all fronts. Intrigue, suspense, sensuality, power and greed at every twist and turn.The highlight for me is Liane Langland as the polar opposite twins, Alexandra and Eve Blackwell. Beautiful, intelligent and excellently acted, Langland brings the wicked Eve to light in a humane, interesting and truthful way. While also playing the innocent opposite in Alexandra.Worth the watch, just for the last 3 hours alone!"
4,Mini-Series (Sidney Sheldon),I had already seen the made for t.v. movie so I knew what to expect. I enjoyed the story and delivery of the product was wonderful. That is why I deal with Amazon.
1,Beware of cracked code!,"As for many others, reading this books was a disappointment for me, too. The other title from Dreamtech with similar name has very same reader's rating and angry comments. I wouldn't recommend this one, unless you are going to print out all their source code and want to save on the printer ink."
2,this is basically a programmer's book,This topic is hard to find information on. I do not know ifthis is for legal or technical reasons.This book is 95% programmer's material. There is a briefexplanation of p2p basics. However this is really written in a dry rather technical manner. As such an ordinary person such asmyself can only stomach one page at a sitting.If you a non-programmer trying to undrstand or trying to utilize this new technology you might find it more usefull to go to a p2p website or program forum and either look for FAQs or help files or even posting questions on the basics of p2p networks.
2,Missing conjugations!?,"So after getting a few chapters into this book I realized that they never teach you how to conjugate the ""tu"" in Spanish, only ""usted."" This is not cool! I learned that this is strictly for tourists and not for someone who just wants to learn the language. BEWARE! Everything else seems fine, but missing conjugating the ""you"" seems pretty lame."
5,Great christmas gift!,"Got these for a christmas gift.. they were a big hit! At first I was a little skeptical, but when I got them they looked really cool"
4,"Not bad, no breaks yet","I have only used these as Sazerac glasses, so far so good. Next steep is Martini's, and Manhattan's! but who drinks that crap LOL..."
3,Cry Baby Tears candy,"Not very sour, and they have an odd powdery aftertaste. Compared to the tart flavor of Skittles or Sweet Tarts, these do not even come close. If you are a fan of Toxic Waste or Warheads don't waste your time or money on these. On the other hand, if you think Sweet Tarts are too tangy you may like them."
2,Lots half the water when it tipped over for a couple of minutes.,the bottle easily tips over and the water leaks every wear. Only good for the cup holder in my car.
3,Good and cheap,"I really like this cd because it has sound of quality and it is cheap, also. The movements are magistrality intenpreted and you can enjoy all the disc in the way you want"
4,Red v/s Blue Season 5,"In the concluding season of Red v/s Blue, Rooster Teeth has stayed true to its original characters and added some new characters that are outrageous enough to establish themselves in just a few short scenes. There is no doubt that these new characters will give the writers plenty of ammunition for future projects. Season Five has everything; love (or lust in Tucker's case), hate, mystery, intrigue, triumphant acts of courage, heartbreaking death of both human and AI. Of course there will be sweet laughter at someone else's expense.The ending left me a little cold. At first I didn't believe it did the characters or the previous season's justice; but after listening to the commentary on the DVD, I believe the ending chosen was the best choice. Thankfully, this is the ending of the series and not the ending of all the characters we've grown to love in Red v/s Blue.Caboose rules!"
3,RvB,It is a wrap up and it is OK. I loved the first and second season so I'm partial when comparing this the the other four.
5,Hard to go wrong,"Red vs Blue is perhaps one of the best internet productions I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. The major factor of this show that makes it so attractive is the witty dialogue. Obviously with this being nothing more than a bunch of guys manipulating characters in inventive ways in a video game, there must be some attraction and the voice acting and plot are the things. Beware, this show is not for those with virgin ears, there is a good amount of adult humor and vulgar language so you have been warned. Otherwise, good viewing, the full series is worth having."
3,"Regarding ""Hyacinth Bucket's (pronounced Boo-KAY'S) Hectic Social Calendar""","This book related to ""Keeping Up Appearances"" raises only one question: Has actress Patricia Routledge recorded an audio-book version of it?To hear the musings of Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Boo-KAY) as spoken by the actress who acts her out in that BBC comedy would be a hilarious companion to this book."
4,Great value for the money!,"No, it does not have the amount of detail or photos as Tigers in Combat but then again it doesn't have the price tag either (hardback).I still have found it a very valuable resource for modelling this legendary vehicle if you cannot afford the more expensive titles covering the Tiger then this is the book for you."
4,Tiger I on the Eastern Front,excellent photographic chronology. on the good side.on the bad? not detailed enough the author picked a very broadsubject and whittled it down to fit in a smaller book! unfortunately we werent able to see any of a stated units slow disintegration through atrition. this book should have been alot bigger! but! overall for its size was a very good book!
5,personal worth,"In a time when we are swamped with superficial ideas, it is wonderful to see a book that shows children and ADULTS how to appreciate a girl or woman for her personal worth instead of just her looks."
2,Ugly is as ugly does,"The story begins well, but the intended portrayal of the Plain Jane as inwardly beautiful fails when she reveals a desperately wicked heart, taking no pity on the hapless sleeping princess who is ugly inside but beautiful outside. Plain Jane even abuses the still-sleeping princess by using her as a hat stand and hangs a ""no kissing"" sign on her to prevent her being ""kissed awake"" by guests. In effect, she condemns the sleeping princess to death, thus exalting herself and becoming ugly in the eyes of those who know true beauty would never do such a thing. I consider Plain Jane more insidiously ugly, for she pretends to have true beauty (of heart) while her physically beautiful counterpart offers no pretense at inner beauty."
3,I wanted to like this more,I wanted an unconventional tale for my daughter and was dissapointed. Although it tries to be unconventional by having the ugly girl being the good one I think it sells it's self short by still focusing the tale on attractiveness. The Jane character uses one of her magic wishes so that the Prince will love her. I would rather have tale about different forms of attractiveness or one in which the beauty of the characters isn't important. I want my daughter to know that morality is about the choices you make rather than the face you see in the mirror. BTW my husband liked this book so perhaps you will too.
1,Not very imaginative,"I'm familiar with Jane Yolen's work and I've got to say that this version of Sleeping Beauty was not terribly creative, imaginative or captivating. As terrific an author as she is, I was very disappointed with this book."
2,"An Illustrated History, NOT an Atlas","I teach world history and own several world history atlases. Of all the world history atlases that I own, the National Geographic Atlas of World History is the most Eurocentric and least useful. Surprisingly, this is an atlas with many beautiful photographs, but relatively few maps. It reads more like a beautifully illustrated world history text for a middle school or high school student than a serious world history atlas.If you are shopping for a world history atlas, I would recommend the DK World Atlas, Oxford (Philip's) Atlas of World History, or the paperback Hammond (Times) Concise Atlas of World History. For what it's worth, the now dated 1993 Times Atlas of World History remains the standard by which all one volume world history atlases are judged."
2,Low on detail; few maps,"I had to get this book, as I love National Geographic feature maps. Once I acquired it, however, I was shocked to discover how few maps are provided by this book. Furthermore, I am usually disappointed by this book when looking for specific events, dates, and locations. Help me recover my dignity as a consumer and buy something else!"
1,Horrible mistake in regards to PERSIAN GOLF ****************,"What the hell is going on... I wonder wich rich royal family in the mid-east has funded this unbeleivable mistake!!!For your info, The Persian golf has existed for thousands of years up until your 2004 Edition.What happened ??? Are you taking advantage of the last moments in mullah history before they are overthrown to clinch a deal with the Arabs ?????I am really disapointed, and did not think that a non-for profit organisation like yours would do such a mistake.RECALLL All Copies or Face Legal Actions.SamVancouver Canada"
1,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this unit- print quality not very good, trouble printing envelopes, constanting hangs and will not print documents at times!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is the worst printer that I had ever purchased. It is worthless! It will not line up, everything printed comes out at an angle, that is if the paper makes it through the machine without getting crumpled or jammed. PIECE O CRAP!!"
1,Item Not Received,"I have purchased this product in January of this year and have not received it. I have asked the seller for information on its whereabouts and have had no response. Please let me know what to do. I'm not sure how I purchased this item but it could have been my American Express. What is the issue and what do I do next? Why would I need to contact the seller again. Can you help me with this?626-931-0055 or cell 626-484-5552Thank you, Lolly"
3,Review Canon D320 Image Class,"My opinion on this product is the copier is okay, but as far as the coping goes with the fact that this copier rolls the paper to copy it does not leave the new copy in a smooth sheet,it has a rolled look.Now when you make a copy on front and back the copylooks even worst than the original copy.Like I said the canon D320 is just okay as a copier/printer it does not stand out as a good quality copier."
1,"Might be a great product, but something you should know.","I got this product about a week ago and setup was simple. Once setup, I printed and it was too light to see. So, I copied an item and it was still too light. After sometime of messing with the printer, I ended up calling Canon support. The guy had me do several things among resetting to factory default. Proceeded to tell me it needed to be taken to their service center (90 miles away) or they would replace it with a refurbished one. Was very disappointed that they didn't want to send out a new one!"
3,This book still works with current version of sas/graph! :-),"125 pages, and color images of all the graphs - quite impressive for graphics software in 1981 :-)Although this book doesn't cover the 'new' sas/graph features (such as ods/web output, java & activex graphs, etc), it's impressive that most (all?) of the things in this old sas/graph reference still work in the current version of sas/graph (year 2006, v9.x).This book would make a nice 'old' book for the sas/graph gurus to keep on display in their bookshelf ;)"
4,Excellent quality,This is the best webcam i've seen so far..pretty compact and stylish... and the quality is amazing! A definitely value for money!
3,logitech quickcam for notebooks pro,well let me start off by saying this is a wonderfull webcam in the day time and in alot of light but if you have low light its going to look dark. but overall great pics 10 seconds selftimer for pics and modes are great. reason for 3 starts is because i want it to work at night and the camera is not too good at night but overall its a wonderfull buy and will try to get a better bulp and see if it makes a diference but happy i did purchase pics in daytime is outstanding and camera in daytime is wonderfull motion is great and has tons of settings so am happy overall
4,VERY NICE,I havent used it for video chat yet. But i can see myself on mylaptop PERFECTLY. I am very pleased with this product especially at this price. The microphone is very loud you will need to turn it down. PIC is crystal Clear. I've even seen myself using skype. the only annoying part is yes it does clip on to my lap top but not as tightly as i would have liked. however it does not fall off. But if u move your laptop around at all it may tilt some. It does come with a stand so the you dont have to clip it onto your notebook.
4,Good item for the price.,"Not much to say here. Plug it in and clip it to your screen and you're good to go. I didn't use the installation disc, instead I found the drivers online. A lot of people said the installation disc includes a bunch of useless stuff that just weighs down your laptop anyway.I have used it for Skying and it works just fine. The mic also seems to operate great.Came with a carrying case so it travels well.Picture seems a little sensitive to light. Just make sure you good room lighting when you use it and there shouldn't be any problems.For the money, I am very pleased with it."
3,Works with Ubutu 7.10,I bought a Dell 1420N with Ubuntu 7.04 installed and pluged this cam in hoping it would work right out of the box as many things seem to do in Ubuntu but it didn't. Then Ubuntu issued their recent update to 7.10 which must of incorporated v4l2 in the kernel. After I updated it worked. I've set it up with Ekiga the video phone that comes with the Dell Ubuntu's default installation. The Dell Ubuntu computer is Great but I wish Logitech would not make it so hard to use there products. Of course I found this out after I bought it.
2,Does Not Work With Dell 6000,"Nice Packaged, Nice Looking Webcam, Clips Seem to work pretty well with Laptop/Notebook.I follow the the menu installed the software before I plug in the web cam. Guess what...after the software was install, it ask me to plug the web cam in...than nothing happen.I check the device manager, it was blank.software conflict with my laptop and made all USB port failI have to switch to safe mode and system restore.I try about 3 time, I give up and returned it to amazon.I never had problem with the Logitech Quick Cam 4000, what so ever.But This one don't seem to work with my Dell 6000. Not sure is the software that came with or the camera is bad."
1,Useless product,"Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks ProPlease do not buy this product, its an utter useless product ,it only works for prior versions of windows 7 only like XP & Vista."
5,great product...non-geek compatible,"I took a flyer on this because I'm frequently disappointed by tech products. Basically, I'm just a user and don't understand most of the descriptions and directions written by people who's first, and perhaps only, language is hexadecimal or that make unfounded knowledge assumptions. I bought this product with some trepidation but my fears were unfounded. In a few simply described steps I got the camera running and everything works great!! Great product and great instructions!!"
4,Solid WEbcam,wish the cable was a bit longer but it's pretty good for the current price if your not looking for super HD quality pictures it will more than do the job.
3,Great for travel!,"This little cam fits in a handy case that they provide you and it's so easy to pack up and go! Installation was a breeze and if you're connected to the internet it will look for the latest software, how considerate! The pic quality is not amazingly great, but for 50 bucks it's perfectly fine. The unit gets a little hot after about 15 min. of skype time but no visible effects to the vid quality. I would buy it again!Good luck to you in your search!"
4,Plug and Play with Linux Ubuntu,"I received the webcam and plugged it into the USB port...done. I run my Toshiba A105 dual boot with either Win XP or Linux Ubuntu 8.10. The Linux install was simply plug and play. The Win XP install was typical - windows install manager battling the Logitec install. Had to run the install a second time to get Win to recognise the device THEN ask for the CD. Device works fine as expected. I wish it had more resolution for the price.Incidentally, I broke the first one when I took it apart and attached the sensor to my telescope. It worked great at first at prime focus but when I tried making a more permanent mount to an eyepiece barrel, I pressed a bit hard and cracked the glass cover over the sensor. I am purchasing another because I KNOW it will work for both operating systems."
1,Won't work with Windows 7,"This camera worked great with XP and Vista, but there is no software for Windows 7, and Logitech is not going to release any Win 7 driver for it. The SW for newer cameras will not work either. I'm really upset that my relatively new webcam will no longer work."
3,Bad audio,"The video quality is pretty good, but the microphone on both the cam and the headset has a bad quality (my laptop mic works much better!)."
2,Not so good,"I would not rate this piece ""good"".Still lot of distortions...So guys go for something else..."
2,Not For Most IBM NoteBooks,"If You own an IBM T - Series NoteBook ( or any IBM NoteBook with the raised Edge from the Flat surface of the LCD Screen ), you can ignore this product because of the clip which is used to attach this Cam to the top of your IBM NoteBook Screen.The Clip will slip on the outer surface of your Laptop Screen and you'll end up with a camera pointing downwards onto your keyboard everytime.The other person who gave the review above : "" Calijoe "" must be using one of the Compact and slim IBM 10 - 12 inch LCD Notebooks;or he must be working for Logitech and is pulling a fast one on all of us.Buy at your own peril.Get the Logitech Fusion instead, although it's not really too portable, if you are a Road Warrior.And like A. Vezirian ""stisev"" has mentioned, download the QuickCam Software from the Logitech WebSite instead of using the one on the CD.Hope this was useful."
2,Good Camera - Poor Fit for Thinkpad,"Camera, mic, drivers, and software all worked fine. The clip will not hold properly on the rather wide edge of the Thinkpad T-series laptop. This caused the unit to constantly slip around and fall off. This is somewhat surprising from Logitech considering popularity of T-series laptops. Logitech Support acknowledged repeated emails but did not offer any solution or resolution."
5,Very good camera,I was surprised when I opened my camera to see that it also had a microphone and and earpiece. So I got more for my money. It fits perfect on my notebook and it's very easy to install. It's a bit pricey but I have to say that it's woth the money.
4,Good video quality,"It's not differ feature to Deluxe version. But I must pay more 30 bucks for this. However, it is compact webcam and good quality. It's automatically dowload sofware in windows Vista when you phug in."
5,Logitech webcam,I love my new webcam. It was exactly what I was looking for. It's very tiny and comes with a travel pouch. This is the perfect webcam for someone on the go.
1,Not for Windows Vista,"I bought this for my daughter who has a laptop with Windows Vista as the operating software. According to the page online this webcam is compatible with WIndows Vista, but when we got the product it said it was only for WIndows Xp, and not for Windows Vista. It was quite upseting for the whole family. My daughter was looking forward to webcamming with her big sister who lives in the United States. Because we are posted overseas it takes a long time for things to ship here, so we could not get a quick replacement. Our oldest daughter was unable to spend Christmas with us this year and everyone was looking forward to webcamming with her."
4,logitech Quickcam Pro,"Does everything as advertised, also some unique editing features to make this a versatile product. The clip for attaching camera to screen could be improved. Recommended"
2,Good camera but heats up prettty quick,"Beware !! It is a good webcam in the sense that, the picture quality is good. But it heats up like anything. I used it for hardly 30 mins and it heated up to a intolerable limit.I had to disconnect."
2,Quickcam for Notebooks,"This webcam does not work with notebooks. I have a brand new Dell Inspirion 1705 and it does not work consistently. I thought maybe it was because of Vista, but it says that it is Vista compatible. I was able to get it working 1 time, and it had a very clear picture, but I have not been able to get it to work since. I have notified Logitech, but have yet to receive a response after 2 weeks."
1,Not a DVD,"I mistakenly believed this was a DVD...it's not. Jane's work out are fast and it's been a while since I did one, so the directions were useless when I tried to do the workout using the CD. And of course I could not return it because I had opened it..I'm out $60+....do not purchase unless you are well versed in Jane's moves."
4,Good book to understand 1 to 1 marketing,This is a good book for someone who is going about setting up a 1 to 1 marketing program for the first time in their company. I like the way it explains in a simple manner what goes into building a 1 to 1 marketing program.The only drawback is that the free site from where one can download the templates that was included with the book is no longer available.
3,www.witagency.com,This book is a good start in developing an internet strategy... It lacks a discussion of relevant tools and what companies will be using 1 year from now..jim
2,Good for the Mom and Pop outfit - not Fortune 500,"The entire ""one-to-one"" concept is only feasible for small companies. Peppers and Rogers Group gives examples of ""florists sending reminders of your mother's birthday"" and ""dry cleaners keeping your extra buttons"" and so forth to retain customers (and eventually charge more for their services, becuase the customer is ""locked in""), but these concepts don't translate to Fortune 500 companies. Ford Motor Company (one of PRG's clients) recently laid off 5,000 executives. You know their CRM campaign was out the door along with rented plants and weekly bagel breakfasts...see how many companies PRG gloated about in the past (Kozmo.com, mykidsbenefit, Mobshop, etc. etc.) are out of business. Plus PRG laid off a bunch of people of their own recently. Peppers and Rogers Group is definitely a fair weather friend to these large firms..."
3,pony pogo stick,I have a 3 1/2 yr old. We got this for a Christmas gift and my daughter loves it. It is still hard for her to ride and balance on but we just stand behind her to help her balance. She also needs to be sure to have shoes on as the feet peddles are slippery and she has slipped off a couple times. The size is nice for little ones.
5,Lots of fun for our little cowboy,"I purchased this gift for a four-year-old, and he adored the pogo pony. Initially, I was concerned whether he would be able to actually use it, but the base of the pogo stick is wide enough that it stands on its own and the kids could climb on to it without it tipping over. This toy helps to teach balance and coordination. It was a big hit."
1,Fell apart,Fell apart 2 weeks after I put on my putter.Got a little wet and started to peel.Do not purchase
3,Be a leader,I thought this book was quite entertaining and that it contains a good deal of knowledge in tactical and leadership techniques
1,This album is weak time!,"This is, easily, the worst album I have heard in quite some time. The sound (note: not music) is best described as a collection of sounds created by the disturbance your mobile phone can cause on your sound system. The fact that labels exist that are willing to put this on CD, must mean the world is a really crazy place."
2,Too big for the Small size,"The jacket is very uncomfortable, the neckline is too high, it is very heavy also. Not a good product, it looks old and used!"
3,"it's ok, but you can't change games","the product it fine, the only problems I found it's, you have to remove all the case in order to change games, and insert earphones."
5,CMT Glue Joint Router Bit,"I really like this router bit for making panel glue ups. In addition to making the joint somewhat stronger, I think the real benefit is that it absolutely takes care of aligning the board edges. Once you get the bit height set (make a set up block for future use) panel glue ups are a breeze."
2,Disappointing,"I liked the 'line up' of the songs. However, some of the artists, ie: Olivia Newton John singing ""Part of Your World"" was just strange. I love her voice; but, this song, for this artist was NOT a good match! Also, Jesse McCartney has such a nasally voice that I did not care for his rendition of ""When you wish Upon a Star"".I thought the premise of the CD for the ""Make a Wish"" foundation was wonderful, which was why I purchased this cd."
5,Superb Disney CD!,"I really like this CD! Most of the songs are very well produced and overall it has a soothing mood.Best tracks are, Someday my prince will come, your heart will lead you home, a dream is a wish your heart make, if you can dream, part of your world, make a wish.I will definitely buy another one if I loose this CD!"
4,Very good songs...,The songs & artists are very good for this recording. My son & I dance every night to Bett Midlar's Baby Mine before I put him in his crib. Wonderful songs.
2,The Rescuers remains neglected!,"One of the most fit songs to appear in this CD comes from Disney's 1977 feature, The Rescuers, and that was Someone's Waiting for You, which's original recording was beautifully performed by Shelby Flint, but why isn't in here? Once again, I wonder why the film's been neglected from appearing in any music CD ever."
4,"Mosaic masterpieces in needlework and handicraft, based on m","I am a stitcher and I loved the idea of this book. It has wonderful mosaic art taken from Israel (some of which I saw myself while there) and it breaks down each motif into a grid to stitch. I very much enjoyed it and think it would be a perfect gift for a wedding, bat mitzvah, or just a sweet Jewish stitcher that you may know. It would be hard to find new as it was copyrighted in Jerusalem, although published in the US and Canada."
5,College Students Must Have It!!!!!,"This is a must have for any high school or College student: man or woman. Parent's, this could save your daughters life! I recently had the opportunity to read this book as well as hear the author speak in a candid seminar on my college campus. We were enlightened so much with the information he has to share. The content provided in this book is priceless-and if you ever get a chance to hear the author speak-Don't miss it!!A MUST HAVE!!!!"
1,bad recording,The Concerto For Oboe and Violin is not good because the recording of the orchestra is too loud compared to the solo oboe.
2,"David Foster presents ""the new Chicago""","It's clear on CHICAGO 16 that the 80's have arrived-- synthesizers are so heavy on this album that half the time I'm not sure if I'm hearing the actual horn section, or merely a reproduction. After 3 more-or-less disappointing albums in a row, this turned out to be almost entirely a Peter Cetera/David Foster project--yet nowhere NEAR as exciting as the previous PETER CETERA solo album. James Pankow's ""Bad Advice"" has lots of brass & attitude, and Robert Lamm's ""Get Away"" may be the most exciting moment on the album-- even if it's only an epilogue. Cetera's ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" is a beautiful love ballad that's probably better than a number of sound-alike tunes that followed on later albums. And Cetera also wrote my 2 favorite tunes here: ""Rescue You"" and ""Love Me Tomorrow"". But for me, the rest are forgettable-- making this my LEAST-favorite of all of Chicago's albums."
1,When good bands turn into ballads...,"David Foster & Peter Cetera probably have chairs waiting for them in hell for when they leave this mortal coil. They can have a place to sit while the get to hear Chicago 16 OVER AND OVER AGAIN. This signified the end of Chicago as a band and the beginning of sappy, lame ballads that would almost kill the band, yet make them and fascinating candidate for VH-1's Behind the Music. The Chicago drama was fun to watch, yet sad when you realized that it wasn't a made up television show... IT WAS REAL LIFE. Very Scary..."
2,Disappointed,"I having problem with this product and I had went to Andis Internet site and complain about it. But, nothing happened at all. I am very much disappointed and I already inform all my friends and relatives not to buy anything that Andis company produced."
3,I got what I paid for,Don't know if this one will last as long as my last rechargeable trimmer. Doesn't seem very sharp and my beard hairs get caught in the blades. Probably not sharp enough.
3,"Poorly designed ""dual voltage"" charger, trimmer works ok","""Dual voltage charger for worldwide use"" - unlike the chargers for my laptop, phone, and tablet; which can all safely be connected to 100 to 240 volts; the Andis 22725 requires you *manually* choose the power input. Picking the wrong option permanently fries the charger. This is exactly the kind of decision/mistake you don't want to make when jet-lagged/traveling, or simply when tired and shaving in early morning. It's a significant usability failure, especially when the Andis charger is also quite bulky compared to those for other devices.That aside, the ""raw"" trimmer works, and it's cheap.I don't use the attachments, so I haven't experienced the problems some other reviewers reported. I also haven't owned an Andis 22725 long enough to comment on battery life."
1,Not exactly as advertised..,"Terrible trimmer... just terrible.The actual model being sold here is NOT the same one pictured in the photo, but rather, a similar looking Andis model that has a slightly longer blade. I owned one that looked exactly like the trimmer in the photo (with a shorter blade) and it was great. The one I purchased here from Amzaon.... well, I absolutely hate it... and I mean with a passion.This model snags, cuts unevenly and is absolutely crap... Worst of all, it is not the same model depicted in the photo, which makes a hell-of a big difference if you are buying it online and can't see it in person. Get it together Amazon!1 Star"
4,Does what it should.,"It's a versatile thing, trims my beard, I even used it to cut my hair once, but that did not go well, as the thing clogs easily. If you use it for cutting your beard, you should be safe."
4,Good trimmer,"Got these for my husband for Christmas, and he really likes it. He likes that he can go anywhere with it and use it in either bathroom, or just grab it and go if we go out of town.Unfortunately the guards are a little cheaply made, he just broke his favorite guard (says 5 day?) and I can't find the replacement for this one guard...do I have to purchase a whole new kit to get one guard??? Off to check out their website!"
3,Never a Smooth Trim,Just never got a good beard trimming experience. Never smooth and often grabby.Suggest checking out the Remington MB-200. I'm very pleased with it.
2,Trims well... when it works,"I've had this trimmer for less than a year and it only worked well for about three months. After that the battery started deteriorating and it was working slower and slower until it would only work well with it plugged in the wall. Now the battery is bad and is not user replaceable. I called the recommended repair depot in San Francisco, but they never returned my calls. I'm replacing it with the plug-in version so I have no more battery worries.Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer"
2,Shaver pulls my hair and doesn't keep charge long,"I switched from a regular hair clipper to an actual beard trimmer assuming it would do a better job. The smaller size makes it easy to get into small spots on my face, but this trimmer pulls my hair often (ouch!) and doesn't keep the charge long. I now just leave it plugged in when I use it. Overall it doesn't give the best trim and I don't recommend it. I would like to find a better product eventually."
1,Worst Beard Trimmer I Have Ever Owned,"I have owned many beard trimmers. This is the worst of all. It can not make single pass without PULLING and SNAGGING your beard hair - and that is both very annoying and painful. After several attempts to use this on different days - making sure it was full charged - the results were always the same and I simply want to smash it into little bits for all that beard plucking pain it has caused me... Maybe the one I was shipped never had its blades sharpened or something, but it mainly pulls - it does not cut worth anything. I'd love to demand my money back but I can't figure out how."
4,Received this book really quick !,received this book really quickly ! Appreciate the very quick delivery ! Very interesting title and content. If you like literature that is off the usual beaten path then you will enjoy this book.
4,Way awesome live cd,This is a awesome cd. The deliverance and tourniquet rock. The guys in deliverance rock. They can really play guitar. The song weapons of our warfare is really rad. Tourniquets phatom limb song is good to. they have amazing playing ability. They didn't use studio musicians. It's better than anything they have out nowadAYS. iT was recorded about 7 years ago. Be a brave man go pick this cd up. If you quality speed metal get this cd
5,The best book on editing your own work I have ever read.,"Cheney doesn't mince words. His techniques will cut, clarify and polish your writing like no other book. This book replaces a couple of writing classes, at least. It should be on every aspiring, and experienced, writer's book shelf."
3,Good book but not the best I've seen,"The author doesn't mince words when it comes to what he thinks is important. Not an especially long book, it is loaded with examples and references all the way through that give you some concrete materials to work with to apply to your own work. Mostly intended for fiction writers, he does bend it some to try and simplify bureacratise and other business writing but more to help *you* figure out what they are really saying that truly simplfying someone's advertising copy. One thing I found slightly annoying was his constant use of percentages to show how by cutting these three words then the sentence was X% shorter. That can be misleading because while a sentence may be shorter, you haven't necessarily clarified it, or you might have cut it too short and lost the point. Use with caution."
4,Why didn't I read this four times?,"Those who have suffered through many of my reviews probably wonder why I never read this book. I hate to admit I have, twice. Be glad. It is not an easy book to read because you keep finding things that make you want to quit reading and go to re-writing. If you at least review the book vefore you review what you've written, you eill find it much more meaningful the second time you read it. Believe it or not I've tried to apply the lessons of this work to all my writing: e-mail, old fashoned letters, business letters (which I taught), travel writing, scholarly writing, and even reviews. This book has been a great help. It may not be what you want to read in a comfortable chair unless you want to go to sleep, but it is well worth the effort and the time.Ii grew up on Strunk and White, and fortunately found this wonderful replacement. Try it. Even if you don't like it, your readers will."
1,Examine Before You Buy!,"I am embarrassed that I actually bought this book of 48 pages without first examining it. I found no ""super sight-reading secrets."" In fact, I found nothing about reading music that I had not already learned from grade school music classes.I did not find the following sort of advice especially useful:""Get a book of all major and minor scales. Begin practicing all 24 major and minor keys.""""Play every note of the Bach Chorales hands alone, without looking, one octave displaced.""I was able to follow much of Richman's text only because I recognized what he was trying to say. I found little clarity in his writing and I was annoyed by his many ungrammatical sentences.My advice is to buy an old standby such as ""Learn to Read Music"" by Howard Shanet."
1,Poorly executed and misleading.,"This book has a gimmicky title and a cheap price, but it fails deplorably on several fronts. For one, the lay-out and print quality are absolutely embarrassing considering the times we live in. One of the few musical examples actually looks as though it were rendered by a dot-matrix printer. Further, the unrealistic exercises are ambiguously described and seldom illustrated. They are also a complete waste of time since one is better off sightreading real compositions. That's why it's better to invest in sheet music/ etudes that suit one's tastes. The Musician's Institute Sightreading for Keyboard book is far more helpful and complete at a comparable price, offering several chapters of exercises and etudes without making ludicrous promises--very professional indeed. There is really no substitute for practice; forget the nonsense of ""secrets"" and invest elsewhere."
1,Not very good,"This ""book"" is more like a short document you could download off the internet. There are hardly any exercises in the book. The author asks you to exercise on other artists works using various methods. The whole book could be summarized on one page if you ask me. Also, half the book is dedicated to teaching you how to read music. Having played piano for 20 years, this half of the book was just wasted paper."
3,Do not buy the book because of the title,"I reserved my detailed comments on the book. I should not have bought the book because of the attractive title. There is really no better way of achieving good sight reading by repeat practice using different pieces. Yes. Practice, practice and practice. There is no shortcut."
5,busy busy busy,this game is really cool. it will take up most of ur time. it took about 70 hours to beat the game but takes a longer time to complete the extra episodes so this game will keep you busy for a while
4,Aussie Park Boyz,"Great ACTION movie. Acting is weak, and also storyline, but fight scenes are awesome and make the movie great. If you enjoyed the Warriors then you'll enjoy this movie, with more fights!!!"
3,Worst Portrayal Of Australia Ever,Have to say i had been waiting to watch this movie for a few years as i'd heard it was supposed to be a great movie but have to say after viewing it it wasn't worth the wait and i found it to be the worst portrayal of australia id ever seen this sort of thing doesnt happen like that in perth australia at all it was way over the top
1,indescribably bad.,"Before I bought this movie, I knew it was bad, a few of my friends told me.... But I had no idea, this movie is truly shockingly bad, I would recommend you buy it and watch it, because it is truly unbelievable that this movie got actually got released, I mean what were they thinking... I could have made a better movie with my friends and the camera on my mobile phone, the Acting is bad, there is no story line, the fight scenes are awful the punches don't even come close, the music makes you want to cut your own ear's out.I mean the movie looks like it was made for a high school assignment. I mean I usually don't mind bad cheesy movies, they are good for a laugh, But this movie goes beyond bad no words can ever describe how bad this movie truly is."
1,don't waste your time,"I was suckered into renting this amateurish attempt at a remake of The Warriors by the Maori thug on the cover and a reference to Once Were Warriors, which was a great film. This wasn't even palatable on a it's-so-bad-it's-good level.One of the worst films I've ever seen."
2,"Well, it seemed to start out good . . .","This had the potential to be a 5-star movie, but halfway through the scriptwriter apparently ran out of original ideas and copied that classic gang movie from the 70's -- ""The Warriors"" -- nearly verbatim, scene for scene . . . such blatent plagiarism is inexcusable.Direction, photography, casting, and acting were all above average -- and the fight choreography was very good (although the later fight scenes devolved into cartoonishly unrealistic silliness).There are a number of continuity errors, the idea of masked gangs is just stupid, and the whole premise of professional criminals attempting such a ridiculous set-up (while remaining anonymous) when they could've just left the tickets where they found 'em and simply waited in ambush with shotguns is borderline retarded.Again, with competant scriptwriting, this could've been a good movie."
2,Disappointed,"I was SO looking forward to receiving these. I had especially chosen these over similar but plainer styles because I loved the look of the ""jewelled"" front. But what a disappointment, on receiving them, to discover that half the ""jewels"" had fallen off! Luckily, they were all still in the box and (hopefully) I'll be able to glue them back on. Certainly not what I expected from a brand new shoe! Having said that, though, they are a good fit and the padded insole should make them comfortable to wear."
1,Please put your money away for this !!!,"The video is choppy and slow. The quality is not very good. Luckily my 1.99 was given as a promotion. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it !!!"
5,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll understand yourself more...","I loved this book so much, I purchased several copies for gifts. Whether you grew up in Maine or Michigan, this authors' straight forward, down to earth approach to life will ignite something in your soul. We can learn much about ourselves from womens' stories - how to love, laugh, nurture, cry and openly share. Sarah Delano's unique perspective on life is richly expressed through her writing. There were times while reading this book I felt I was right there with her."
4,"Have the LP of this, but...","I agree with the previous four reviewers on the performance. I have collected every Brahms Fourth on LP that I could get my hands on and this one is by far the most wonderful.Unfortunately, the sound of the LP is not good. It sounds very similar to a digital recording with the attendant harshness and grainy sound. I have been desperately been searching for the original RCA Gold Label pressing of this performance in order to compare.I'm sure if you just listen to CDs you could appreciate the sound, but for the higher resolution you can get from high-end vinyl playback, this pressing is not up to ""audiophile"" standards in my opinion."
3,A good try,"With respects to Mr. Hurwitz, I don't think Reiner was able to scare the RPO enough, as they are just not up to the task at hand. Interestingly, their performance pales in comparison to the ""pick up"" Columbia Orchestra Bruno Walter called upon to complete his Brahms cycle. Aside from these technical issues, there are also those pesky interpretive problems. The first movement takes a decidely light hearted, brisk approach - an interpretive nuance badly matching what is essentially a more tragic, heroic themed composition. The second is nicely phrased and quite lovely. The fourth movement is marred by the oddly articulated and punctuated brass choral variation. What was Reiner thinking? The best 4ths remain Kleiber, Ashkenazy, Solti and Walter."
5,a deep and satisfying tale,"This story pulled me in deep and wouldn't let go. It got richer and thicker as it went along. The best of it to me was the love story at the heart of the book. The main character, Mitra, goes around as a boy for safety reasons. Then a boy meets her and instantly knows she is a girl, even though no one else has seen through her disguise. And he loves her. This idea, that someone who loves you is someone who can see you, and how good it is to be seen, are beautifully and convincingly rendered."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,This is a hauntingly beautiful story. The settings are fabulous. The characters are heartbreaking and original. The ending lifted my spirit like a dream you can't explain but that makes you feel wonderful for days. Just read it.
5,Impressive,"This book is extraordinary! I love the word ""procovery"" meaning success can be found looking forward to new life and building new dreams regardless of the symptoms or diagnosis. As a case manager, I've read dozens and dozens of books on overcoming mental illness, and this is the first one to really address the difficult realities I see in practice every day with hope and practical suggestions. Procovery should be taught in graduate school for understanding the challenges and possibilities for overcoming mental illness. The sense of hope and practical guidance run throughout the book, and the separate ""Procovery Notes"" for consumers, family and staff make it easy for me to share the information and book with clients. I particularly agree with the ""just start anywhere"" principle - from my own experience it makes sense to start from where someone's energy is - and am impressed the way the book is designed so that it too can be started anywhere."
1,Horrible Version of TOTS,"The TAMING OF THE SHREW is supposed to be a comedy, but you would never know it by watching this version. It is the dullest version of TAMING OF THE SHREW that I've seen. There is no chemistry between this version's Kate & Petruchio. The BBC may do a good job on some films, but this is not one of them. I really dislike the Zefferelli version (starring Liz Taylor & Richard Burton), but if possible, this version is even worse.I would encourage anyone who likes TAMING OF THE SHREW to get the ACT (American Conservatory Theater) version, starring Marc Singer and Freddie Olster. That is a superb version of the play (in fact, it it the most well-acted and produced version of any Shakespeare play that I've ever seen---and I've seen many), and you can get it on DVD via Amazon."
4,porch light,it is how it is describe.....what can you say about it???arrived on time and screwed it in presto done.ok light cover
3,Its not 10 pc but 9 pc Kit,"As shown in the image, its not a 10 pc kit. The right top attachment next to the komb does not come in the kit.Rest the clipper works great."
1,very badly made,This thing broke during the third time I was using it. I was very disappointed. The material seems to be cheap and poorly manufactured. I bought the Wahl 79900 after this and it's so much better. It costs $10 more but it is worth it.
1,Broke after two uses,"This worked great the first couple times, but after that it started roaring like a jackhammer. It was literally loud enough for my neighbors to hear -- and I live in the suburbs. I ended up throwing it away."
4,Great item,I'm working in Afghanistan and this item came to me fairly quickly. It feels sturdyand should last a long time.
3,Read the manual before 1st use!,It's a good value clipper for the cheap price of under $15. Make sure you read the manual before using for the first time in order to set the power screw correctly. It does get pretty warm after using for a while. It also doesn't cut as close as I would like when using the blade only. Still its a good clipper for the money.
2,problem,i like it from of first time until it has some problem it doesn't work very good the switch has problem i tried more time to turn on
5,A great prayer aid,This probably one of the best books on praying the prayers of the Bible. It helps the Christian focus on the spiritual needs and concerns of believers.[[ASIN:1609763351 Did Jesus REALLY Say THAT? The Unpopular or Little Known Sayings of Jesus.
5,The best leather cleaner,"Love these wipes for cleaning my leather furniture. I've tried every product out there and so far these work the best!! They leave your leather shining, but they don't have that armour all shine like the wipes you use for your car. Just a nice clean shine. They don't leave your furniture sticky either. A must have. If you clean, you must have these for the finishing touches."
3,Marginal cleaning,It cleans liquid stains that haven't solidified. And other light markings of unknown origin. But it doesn't work well on the headrests where grime builds up.
1,Ruined a nice sofa.,This product is horrible; it took the finish off a nice leather sofa we've enjoyed in our home for years. The surface of the leather turned dry and matte in patches and the dye from the leather is coming off and getting on our clothes. We now have to sit on the couch with a sheet covering it!It's one thing for a product not to work as promised but to ruin a nice piece of furniture is a shame.
5,A must for the TV collector,"Vintage TV's are a great pop-culture item - and they can be made to work too! This book will help you see what's out there. The prices on these sets will vary greatly due to the current economic situtation, trends with collectors, and the part of the country your buying it in, so don't rely on the written values. It's a small quality book!"
5,Classic Guide to TV collecting,"Well written with beautiful pictures, this guide is a classic for TV collectors and others interested in vintage TV. Although the prices of many of these sets has risen considerably since this was published, some of the newer transistor sets are about the same, while many of the older B/W and color sets are now about 2X to 5X the prices listed."
5,Great replacement adapter,"This adapter is superior to the one that came with my wireless receiver. The old one was a wall-wart, this one has the AC cord on one end and the DC cord on the other. Much better."
4,I wish they still wrote planners like this one.,"This is a very progressive 70's ceremony planner written by a Humanist minister. It's a little dated: the idea of doing your ""own thing"" goes a little farther than most current planners I've read. However, the break from the standard examples of how to add cute touches to your wedding was refreshing. This planner had suggestions for how to make the ceremony more meaningful to the couple. That's rare, these days.This is also only planner I've seen that lists the basic requirements for a legal marriage in all fifty states. It's a sure-fire way to keep a book from being handed down over the years, but it's a wonderful idea.Dated and out-of-date, but this book will give you a lot to think about."
4,Build Your Own Underwater Robot,"Really neat book. I have wanted to tinker with an underwater robot for some time. Indeed, who hasn't wanted to build a submarine or something like it since they saw their first submarine war movie.This book presents the fundamental design challenges in very clear English. There are 2 vehicle designs presented with plenty of diagrams and hints to avoid common pitfalls. The techniques for waterproofing the motors and control system are very simple and are commonly available in any hardware store or even already in the household. Great book to get one started in underwater robotics. And to finally fulfill that childhood dream."
5,Nice book for all ages,"Nice and detailed book. Two ROV projects; one for starters and one for more advanced users. It contains other projects too, all made with easy to find materials. Recommended for all ages."
4,Jesus Loves You/Forever Friend,"This album is great, however the songs on the CDs do not match with the songs written on Album case. I am short about 4 songs. Too much of a hassel to return the item."
3,Needs more substance,"I admit I bought this book because of the ten days, quick fix idea. I am most of the way through the book. It has some good strategies in it, but nothing that the parent or teacher of a defiant child hasn't already figured out. I was disappointed that the author spends so much time reassuring the reader that he or she is a good parent and reading the book shows that. I just wanted to get to the meat of it, but I think some people might enjoy that constant reassurance, so I gave it three stars. I started another book that I recommend more: Transforming the Difficult Child: The Nurtured Heart Approach. It's more scientific-feeling, and that appeals to me more."
2,don't see this working,"I don't get it. Where is the concrete advice? Seems like he is saying to give them lots of love and try to understand them..OK.. so, What do I do when my 14 year old disrupts our family every night by being obnoxious at the dinner table and I ask her to stop 5 times...she does not learn from her mistakes and does not listen to anything we ask.. I am then told to not use consequences.. OK. What do I do? We are all enjoying a nice dinner and she is being loud and annoying. We are supposed to ask her what is going on with her and validate her? Being ADD is not an excuse for bad behavior. She lost her computer for the night..maybe that will get through."
4,Not for toddlers...Ages 4 thru teen years,"I only read the intro to this book and that is where I found out this is for ages 4 and up. I was really looking for something for my newly turned 2-year old daughter who thinks she owns the world! Although after perusing through the chapters, this books appears to be well laid out and very user friendly as far as finding info on specific items/behaviors. I will definately hold onto this book because I imagine my daughter will have some newfound hostility in 2 more years. I rated 4 stars because I didn't know it was for children and not for toddlers. From what I briefed, though, this book seems like it will be very helpful for parents of defient school aged children."
5,Great resource,This book provides a step by step way to handle odd children and I have recommended it to the parents I work with for their children. As a therapist this is a great resource
4,10 Days to a Less Defiant Child,This book is a great tool for those who are at their wit's end. I would recommend anyone dealing with a defiant child to get a copy. It has been an eye-opener for me. Good luck to all those out there searching for an answer!
3,Not really for toddlers,This book is more for children that you can reason with. I wouldn't recommend it for 3& under. It won't be very helpful.
1,This guy is nuts,"I do not believe this person has ever dealt with a truly ODD child. He gives examples that are not realistic. If you give your ODD child praise you will not hear thanks thats all I needed to hear. The truly ODD child will take any limits or suggestions you give and try and take it one step further. There are some very good suggestions, no yelling ODD children shut down when the parent yells. But to say I do not approve of this or that just tells the ODD child to see to what extent you don't approve. Remember they think they are the adult you are, they must be reminded that they are not they have not gone through the life experiences you have and have learned by, they also think anything you learned from is dumb they could have done it right or better. Stay away from this book if your child is truly ODD I suggest ""The Defiant Child: by Dr douglas A Riley"
4,Great book,I thought that this book was really helpful and really supportive towards parents. Bernstein was able to get me to address MY issues as a parent and look at what changes I needed to make without making me feel like I'd screwed it all up. He uses some self-disclosure which gives him a very humbled tone - easy to take advice from because he's not coming off as condescending or superior. The author also seems very balanced in terms of praise and consequences instead of so many books which are too harsh or way too coddling.
4,Reassuring Guide to better parenting.,"I feel better as a parent after reading Dr. Bernstein's book. But at times it is difficult in certain situations to adapt his philosphies to te real world. Maybe it takes practice and time. The book definetly identifies the triggers that increase negative behavior, which I found very helpful"
4,Very good parenting advice,This book has some very simple and practical ideas for dealing with children who see to continually defie authority and yet are sweet personalities in every other respect.We have a 14 year old grandson who is this type of child and it's very difficult to understand why he does what he does. This book has truly helped everyone around him to deal with the situation.
2,Kinda narrow,These were very narrow but the colour was cute and the style had to send them back though
2,Nothing Special,"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money."
3,Decent canned clam chowder,"I've had better canned clam chowder. Bookbinders is one that comes to mind. I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited. For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok. The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes. More clams and potatoes would improve it. As it is, the ingredients were skimpy."
2,Gross. Non-authentic taste,"Ok first I am from Mass. So I know what good chowdah is. And this ain't cutting it. I like other people thought that because it was expensive, it would be good. Wrong. Actually progresso clam chowder tastes awesome and authentic. This chowder is bland and gross. The clams tasted like metal as well."
3,Best canned Clam chowder I've ever had,"...........but still not that great. It's bland. Even when I added salt, pepper, milk, and butter, it didn't taste like the best I've had. But at least it's edible, unlike every other canned clam chowder out there. If I can find a way to make this taste better than I'd love it. It's the best CANNED clam chowder I've ever had, but it's not that great. The clams taste good.EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did. So I suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup. It's still not the best I've ever had though."
4,really good stuff from a can!,"I was concerned that anything, particularly anything having to do with shellfish, that came from a can, might be bad news. This is not bad news. It is good news. It is not the very best clam chowder that you have ever eaten in your entire life. From a can, though, its pretty impressive. The vegetables and clams are identifiable, there is no questionable ""fishy"" taste. Have some tobasco and bread on hand, and its a great lunch with no effort at all."
3,Can't find the clams,"I just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder, and was disappointed to find, or rather, not find, clams. Don't get me wrong -- the soup was good, with a very nice texture and taste, but the clams were AWOL. Several times I bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor, but only once did I find a clam fragment big enough to look at. I'm going to buy some chopped clams to kind of ""chum"" a bit. This, of course increases the cost of the meal. I'm going to try some other brands as well.I do hope that Bar Harbor does some testing. The label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient, but I don't see how that can be -- my money is on the potatos."
5,"Yes, it's from a can...","I've definitely had a stigma against canned anything (and still do). Picked this up at the supermarket, drawn by the all natural ingredients (for once no MSG or really anything else I didn't recognize). It's really quite good, and especially so for coming out of a can. I can have excellent clam chowder -- and with a little milk and butter, exactly to my liking -- warm within minutes. One of the few canned goods I keep in my cabinet, and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always 5 minutes away.Highly recommended."
2,"I, too, am perplexed","I've just prepared my first can of this soup. It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor. So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine. For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure. There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's - but that's damning with faint praise. Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably. I'm just perplexed by these reviews; I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better. And, of course, it's much less expensive."
4,"Bar Harbor All Natural New England Clam Chowder, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)",This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
2,Tasteless,"I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews. This was the most bland chowder I've ever had. I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing! Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing. Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender. The consistency was pretty good too. It just had no flavor. Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too."
1,Lame,"I was at the store with my wife and we had decided on soup and sandwiches for dinner. I spotted a ""New Item"" for this can of soup. It was priced at $3.99 a can and me not being a fan of soup and sandwich for dinner thought ""if I'm going to have to eat that I'm buying some ""good"" soup. All I have to say is ""yuck""!!! Bland, watery, and has the consistency of baby food. I added salt, pepper, bacon and green onion to try and jazz it up....still lame. The instructions say add butter and milk/cream which I did both but the instruction don't bother to say how much. Just lame soup, they should be ashamed of themselves for asking that much for crap."
1,Absolutely disgusting.,I chose this brand because it was the most expensive option at the supermarket and claimed to be authentic. What a shock when I took my first spoonful (there wasn't a second). It really tasted rancid. Steer clear of this junk - wait until you're in a decent seafood restaurant and get it there.
2,Not very good,"My local store had the product lineon close-out at 77 cents a can so I bought a dozen cans of different verities. Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down. The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor. The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out. Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good. I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups... Sorry, I had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can I would never buy this again"
1,Dropped from a plane?,"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box."
4,MMMMMM,very good clam chowder.not as good as being in Maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders
4,A good fast moving old style scifi book,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit and bought the second one. The action was fun, and the writing fast paced. There wasn't a great deal of character development, and I would like to see this evolve in future books. I will read the second book in the series, and probably the third, unless I am disappointed. If you are looking for a fun, fast read, this is a good choice."
5,Mitch Hedberg ... God rest his talented soul,"When I heard Mitch had passed away a few weeks ago, I had to buy both CDs knowing I'd never get to see him perform again. He is an incredible ... incredible ... talented comedian. Everything he says is just a stitch. He takes the ordinary and makes you laugh like no other. My favorite from this CD ... the koala infestation. Oh gosh...I feel a giggle coming on. He's brilliant."
3,My Own Words,I liked Mitch All Together much better. Strategic Grill Locations must have been his first comedy CD because he seems too messed up and unsure of himself to be as funny as he was.
3,Mitch All Together is better...,"I saw Mitch on his Comedy Central special a while back and loved him... I purchased Mitch All Together (MAT) (w/ bonus DVD) shortly thereafter. Very pleased with that disc, I got Strategic Grill Locations (SGL). While this album is very funny and very Mitch, I recommend MAT cd/dvd combo if you're choosing between them. Mitch's delivery is better on MAT and owning both (which I do) is a little disappointing due to overlap in material. Still, if you're a big Mitch fan, you may want both. Hedberg (r.i.p.) is hysterical and original and all his material is worth a listen."
1,Worthless,"A complete and shocking waste of time. Not funny in the least. I got the impression that Hedberg was either high or very drunk - his jokes, if they could be called jokes, were of the stoner variety - funny only to the person telling them."
2,Paying homage to his idol. The spirit of JAR JAR BINKS.,"HORRIBLE DELIVERY with semi humorous speech is an irresistable combination to some. Not to me. If you're stoned or 13 or an anime fan, you're in for a treat.Listening to this cd is like being hungover at work.That made up accent of his makes me beg for death AND lust for the red red blood of everything in my immediate vicinity. Ms. Piggy has a more realistic voice.reminiscent of JARJAR BINKS, Pee-Wee Herman, Urkel, etc."
3,Not what I thought they would be...,I bought these wraps because I have wrist pain when I bench press. They were a little too long. I had to wrap them around so much and felt that they were too bulky on my wrists. They do help with keeping your wrist supported though.I bought the 12in. wraps which feel less bulky.
2,Not worth the price,"Having recently completed my pursuit of the 2003 MCSE, I can say that these books are nothing more than a highlight of the topics you need to know in order to pass the exams. ExamCram seems to have rested on it's laurels on this one.I consistenly found myself looking to other books and MS resources to find the information that I was seeking, and eventually shut these books and moved on without them. I did not look back. Several topics that were covered in the various exams were not even mentioned in the books, such as NLB affinity. The information contained is many times incomplete, or too general to be of any use on the exams. As the exams are more real-world experience based now, the ""memorize this"" format presented here does not serve as well as in the past.I recommend the Microsoft Press and Syngress books as far better resources. I wouldn't recommend this set as anything more than a cross-reference for the better books available."
4,Great quick way to read this book!,When I was assigned to read this book I needed a quick to read this book. I searched amazon and this automatically came up! I ordered and the next day I got it and started reading it. It clearly explained the book in a way anyone can understand. But it may seem a little exspensive yet it's worth the price thats why I gave it 4 stars!
5,Michael McDonald Is Simply The Best Artist Of Our Times!!,"This cd has such a wonderful mixture of emotions.Losing end we have all been to that point at one time or another.I can let go now, brings back memories and promices is that you will get thru it.Believe in it,makes you feel like dancing!! If that what it takes,goes out for all the spoiled women like yours truly(me)!! Keep Forgetting is my favorite song,I just love this song never get tired of it. I own every cd Michael Mc Donald made and I am looking forward to the next one.Next time you go for a drive listen to any of his cd""s and it is even a pleasure to arrive at work with it playing in your mind!!Fantastic!!!"
1,So cliché I want to rewrite it myself,There are not original ideas in this manga. How can he now be a woman?? yees that is very original!! What is wrong with people? They keep writing the same stories time and time again.
2,"Nice tone, but . . .","It's hard to love the music from this ""Celtic"" wind chime when you see the flimsy box, generically labeled ""Made in China,"" that it arrives in, let alone the extremely thin, extremely cheap-looking cross that hangs from it. Celtic? Christian? Hardly."
5,Beautiful Windchimes,Beautiful! In both looks and their sound. I highly recommend. Would make a great gift!
5,Slick,"I purchased 8 of these baskets. They arrived, four to a box, promptly from [...]. All the hardware needed for installation was attached to each basket. Installation on flat shelves was a breeze, but for lower shelves with lips, I had to install a shim first. I also added construction adhesive for extra protection. One of the baskets contains canned and bottled goods and stands up to the strain. Another has rolls of wraps and boxes of plastic bags -- no more losing the small boxes in the back of the cupboards. I will be buying more of these for other rooms."
4,Holds alot!!,"These pull out drawers hold ALOT!! If you have a bad back, you must invest in these for lower, deep cabinets. These drawers will not only make items easily accessible, but also keep your products neatly contained, not having to rearrange, reorganize, etc...and entire cabinet because of one item you had a hard time locating. I am glad I purchased two. The tend to loose the ease in the glide, but will not jam like others seem to do soon after a few pullings, and pushings."
5,Mistake,"The basket is very well built and slides in and out easily. My only problem is that I was not careful choosing the right size. I discovered that the face frame is only 10 3/4"" wide, but the basket is 11"". BUMMER!. I did use it under the sink. I ended up buying the right size."
2,Good if it could fit in atleast one space in my house,Check your dimensions before buying this! This unit should say 'extra extra large' because it is huge and couldn't get it to fit under any bathroom or kitchen sink in my house and I have a large house. It was my fault for not measuring and doing an impulse buy so now it just sits unused in the garage. I can't comment on the functionality since I haven't been able to use it.
3,Like the curate's egg - good in parts,Dull style. Some interesting comments and observations. Needs more stories to bring it to life. Obviously Patten doesn't intend to go to Peking for his holidays.
1,A horrible book,"This author's bloated, rambling prose made it hard to get through even a single chapter of this book. (The actual germane information could have been condensed to about 50 pages.)Patten may have had a point to make if you have the patience to search for it.Compare a book like this to Margaret Thatcher's ""Statecraft,"" where each topic was dealt with succinctly and synopsized with bullet points at the end of each section.The absolute most this book is worth is $1-- and then only as a textbook example of how a completely unfocused book reads."
2,Hong Yawn,"I have read all the other fine reviews and at the risk of being the skunk at the picnic I have to say it: This book was dull. D-u-l-l. An interesting, fascinating subject written by a man who has spent way too many years in politics,associating with way too many bureaucrats. Frankly, he should have had a ghostwriter or some such to do this up for him; that, or he should have written a biography about his years as the last governor of Hong Kong. Now that would have been some story...but,alas, what we have instead is nearly dry as dust and only half as interesting; ""where the minnows talk like whales"", as Faulkner would say. This could have been such a good book-- given the subject matter- but alas... So I give it two stars: One for effort, and one for its ability to cure insomnia."
4,Interesting!,"This is the first rock biography I've read. The author covers the peak and the long fall of Kiss pretty well, and seems to be honest - there don't seem to be too many axes to grind and he doesn't badmouth all of the members. The financial information is revealing, I never realised how much bands can make on those year-long tours where they hit everywhere. There's a boring bit in the middle about Diana Ross, but I skipped that. Recommended to fans of the group who want an insider view."
4,Very well written,"Chris Lenten was straight out of Business school with his MBA, when he was litteraly thrown to the wolves, wolves being KISS in this business.His book is uncannily accurate with specific dates and names. Which is very impressive, if they are real. either way it was a book that I went back to read many times. I would definitely suggest it but you should have a dictionary next to you becuase he uses big words that the average joe may not understand."
4,Detailed but intense read! Kept me wanting to read more.,"C.K. Lendt has written one of the better KISS books. A lot of fans may complain it was a hard read because of all the details, but that is what I loved about it - It is not just bubblegum writing about how great KISS is like most of the books out there. My favorite chapter is Chapter 8 - Cracks on the Surface! The book also has a lot of great pictures of the author and the band. The end is pretty good too - the Epilogue area which tells you what happened to the ""characters"" in the story. Great job Mr. Lendt! The author was kind enough to also sign a copy for me...he seems like a really cool person as well."
1,This book is a SNOOZER!,"KISS and Sell is such a chore to read. Very laborious.KISS and Sell's counterpart book KISS and Tell by Gebert and McAdams was a much better read. In fact, it was hard to put the KISS and Tell book down as KISS and Sell I found myself forcing myself to read on and putting it down frequently.Get KISS and Tell by Gebert and McAdams, GREAT BOOK, KISS and SELL, pass on it unless you have insomnia and need a drug-free way to get to sleep."
4,An insider's view of The Hottest Band In The World,"I loved this book! It was so interesting to read about the behind the scenes workings of a super-group. It was always a mystery to me how the band managed to survive the early eighties when they didn't do much of anything in the United States. It's all in here. If you are a fan of the band, then you should read this book. Chris was part of the inner sanctum for the band's peak. He was there for it all."
2,Bogged Down,"Sorry, but this one didn't grab me. Lendt seems to be obsessed with what people wear to meetings, which retaurants he enjoyed, and using words that English Teachers will have to look up. He seems to be especially concerned with fashion. Which is fine if discussing the band, but his fashion observations were focused on executives, promoters, lawyers & assorted business types. And he seems to be extremely concerned with everyone's wardrobe.I was impressed with his coverage of the band's financial situation, especially during their lean years, and, I cannot in any way question Lendt's Financial Management expertise. Just please Chris, let some of your personal stuff stay just that."
2,"Good stuff, but you have to look for it.","The author is definately not a KISS fan. Too much of the business side and not enough stories for my taste. I'm a huge KISS fan, but I fell asleep reading this book numerous times."
1,I did not get what I wanted.,"Neither a Domke, nor a jacket. I have been in touch with seller and will send the product back.Amazon must be more careful regarding misidentification of products.Vest and jacket are two very different things."
2,Slow and Corruptable,"I had already sent this card back once as it had corrupted the images in my Digital Elph camera. I am not a professional photographer, but I did get a bit tired of waiting for the pictures to write to the card after taking photos. I would recommend a newer/faster card than this."
4,Sin City = Murder,"SIN CITY is another pretty good CSI read, with dual plot lines. A religious housewife is missing, and Grissom and Brass are pretty sure her husband is behind her mysterious disappearance. At the same time, Catherine and Sara are working on the strangulation murder of an exotic dancer in the stripclub where she worked.An overall decent and quick read."
4,CSI: Sin City,"A lot like the TV show. But there are some extra bits of insight....like, I did not know that the CSI team that we watch on Thursday nights is actually the 2nd shift. But when you think about it they always seem to be on the crime scene at night.Good TV novel."
4,Liked it a lot!,"Very interesting reading. I think the characters are pretty well portrayed and the cases are good, but I liked ""Double Dealer"" better, because I always prefer the entire team working in the same investigation."
2,Old recordings,"Tracks are from performances in 1949, the restare from performances in 1929. The quality iswhat you would expect from these years."
5,We Love Salty!!!,"What can you say. Some of the Engines just sit there, but Salty has all this personality! He is a hard working diesel (who doesn't have some of the personality problems of the other diesels :-) and he loves the sea. He also loves to talk about all the places he has been. ""Have you ever worked Marsaille?""Beyond that, Salty is a ruggedly built little train that small kid's adore. Certainly he is a favorite with my 3 year-old son. And even my 5 year-old daughter will talk about his adventures.We really like the ""Percy's Chocolate Crunch"" book and tape because it includes the fun story ""Salty's Secret"". ""Yo ho ho and a bucket of prawns... the tiller spins and the captain yawns."""
5,Salty the seaside diesel,"If your child likes playing with Thomas & Friends trains, Salty is a red diesel engine, and like Mavis, he has black and yellow stripes around his face. Salty was brought to the Island to help Mavis, Bill, and Ben shape up the troublesome trucks in the quarry. He did such a good job of doing it, no other engine could do it.Salty will ocassionally work in the quarry and other places on the island, but since he has the personality of a sea captain, he likes to work at the Brendam Docks. In fact, Sir Topham Hatt thought that Salty did such a good job, he gave him a new job at Brendam Docks. Salty now works with Cranky the crane, loading and unloading various cargo. If you need an engine to help you with heavy-duty jobs, I recommend adding Salty to your collection."
4,Thomas & Friends Trains for Vander,These trains are a source of delight and endless hours of play for my grandson who is nearly 3. The trains are well made and withstand tough treatment and long hours of play. The prices are very reasonable and the selection is much better than in the retail stores. Extra fast shipping and processing put the toy in his hands almost immediately. The colors withstand frequent baths and rainshowers as well as the blistering sun of Alabama and don't fade. A quality set of train toys for young children.Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Salty Engine
2,"cool idea, but fails to deliver","it's as though the bee gees and the pointer sisters got together to cover this classic track, and although it's weird, and i like weird, it just doesn't grab me. and unsurprisingly, the fatboy slim remix is uninspired. it's worth buying if you're a collector of bizarre covers (which is why i got it), but if you're looking for quality glam (non-disco variety), my vote goes to 'the darkness': _permission to land_, especially the tracks ""growing on me"" and ""i believe in a thing called love""."
4,"Something of a ""tweener""","This is a beautiful watch but it is halfway between formal and casual and halfway between pure simple design and busy. It is eminently functional - easy to read and light to wear. If you are looking for a piece of jewelry or a work of visual art in a watch, this is not it. But if you just want to look good and know the time, this should work well for you."
3,Near great score...3 1/2 stars actually,"This is the first among the collaborations between Shore and The London Philharmonic. Be it so, they are already in quite perfect synch, the musicians aptly handling Shore's spare and dissonant use of strings and horns. This is a big score, a loud score, an operatic score reflecting the mythic and transgressive elements of the film. ""Main Title"" and ""Finale"" are real standouts with the rest of the tracks being nice if a bit too short. While not as austere as some of his other work, Shore work here is admirable for it's scale and unabashed emotionality.(Also check out the score by Christopher Young...a great score!)"
2,~I won't buy this product again~,I was really hoping this product was going to taste good. Unfortunately this product tasted only slightly better than cough syrup. I guess I will go back to protein powders as at least the taste is vastly superior.
5,Great Taste,"This Amino liquid is awesome, due to it being the only one that does'nt taste awful and actually tastes really good. I've been using ON supplement line for years and find it very affordable and of high quality"
4,Nice,"It is a very nice bed. Both of my guinea pigs love it. The only problem is they poop and pee in it, and you can notice it. You can see the pee when you lift up the bed, its all at the bottom. Other than that, its very nice and comfy for the piggies."
3,Good enough...,The bed was bigger than i expected. It takes up a lot of pace in our little guinea pigs cage. Also it wasnt as cute as it looks in the picture. But all and all it was a good purchase... I mean my guinea pig enjoys sleeping in it and i really cant complain if its just gonna end up full of poop and food.
3,Decent but no ER 411,"Bought this to replace my ER 411, which I've dropped too many times. It's good enough, but takes twice the work to do 90% of the job that my Panasonic did. Would have preferred to have known that it cuts only to 1/16"", not flush."
5,Great,All of my nosehairs are gone thanks to this little beauty. It took care of them like the champion that it is.
3,You get what you pay for...,"This product proves the old addage ""you get what you pay for"". It is relatively cheap but, as a result, does not work anywhere close to effectively vis a vis more expensive (in some cases only slighly more expensive) makes of other trimmers. This trimmer simply does not do that good of a job at trimming. This reviewer recommends going with a slightly more expensive trimmer make (i.e., Panasonic) that are only a little more expensive but much more effective."
3,Decent Trimmer,"I purchased the Panasonic Wet/dry nose and ear hair trimmer a few months ago. After about 3 months or so, it stopped working. And that was my second one, because the first one I had to return because it wouldn't turn on. On the plus side to this Andis, it has no problem so far turning on and working.The pros to this product are that it works, it feels sturdy, light weight, easy to manuever, perfect size, and easy to clean. However, it just doesn't get a close cut. Especially compared to my old Panasonic one. You have to go over the same place many times with this Andis to get every hair.Over all I am happy with this product. It works well, just takes more time to do so. And a note to anyone buying this, it won't clip head on. It only clips from the side of the head, not the front of it. Once you realize this, it won't take as long to trim."
1,useless,It get hot in few seconds and burned ..useless and don't know why it got high review. I just got it and it going to be in the trash.
3,Fine If You Can Open Its Packaging,"I see the same molded-in markings on the Andis as were on the Panasonic that it replaces. The Panasonic lasted for several years and I'm sure that this is the same unit and will last as long. Now the negative: This is the worst of modern packaging (and drops what would've been a 5-star rating to just three) and really requires the use of a band saw for safe product removal. I actually sustained a 3/4"" bleeding gash from the packaging itself so be careful. Odd how I can build 50' boats from scratch and never get wounded any worse than I did from the Andis packaging!"
3,Just...ok,This product works just OK. It dosn't have the same feeling of quality that most Andis products have. Could probly buy a cheaper one that will be just the same as this.
2,Barely Works,"Blade looks sharp, motor works fine, but it does a poor job of catching and cutting my ear and nose hair or brows. Surprisingly poor."
2,"OK for the price, but not as advertised for its purpose","My first impression was how light and cheap feeling it was, but that was not the reason I purchased it. I tried it and conclude that it's OK, but did not meet my expectations. I suggest others search other options, as I will."
2,Dead after ~1 year,"My old trimmer gave up after a couple of years. Andis was the replacement. The design is definitely better than what I had before. The main improvement is the cover and the on switch. The cover actually stays put and protects the trimmer from accidentally being turned on (usually a problem when it is in your luggage and it arrives with dead batteries). Cleaning is also very easy: you can remove the head and rinse it with water.Update: It's pretty much dead after ~1 year. It works without the head, but as soon as you put the head it loses power. Will be looking for something else."
4,Andis trimmer,"Have bought 4 other nose trimmer's and none of them does as good a job as this one,so it is a winner and also cost less."
4,Works!!,I was looking for something that simply does what it's supposed to.. In this case trim unwanted nose hair.. It does just that and it does it quickly with no pull or tug.. Good simple product.. Great price..
2,feels like it will break quickly,I've had a panasonic nose trimmer before and it felt solid and lasted for a couple of years. The Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer feels light weight and cheap. It slowed down significantly with little pressure on it. I had it for about a month and have now put it in the mail back to Amazon because I didn't think it would last much longer. Just no confidence in the product after using it a couple of times.
3,New to trimmers,"New to trimmers so I have nothing to compare this too. However, it works great. Quick, easy, and no hair pulling.It's now two months later and it is still working fine. However, the construction is a little weak. A small piece of plastic broke off that helps turn the blades. Since there are two of these it is still working. If the other breaks off, I have no idea if it will continue working.Reducing to 3 stars do to this."
1,Cheaply made.,Not a good item in my opinion. Large front is to large to get in to the back of my nose. Does not cut close. I've never been accused of having small nostrils. Cheap thin plastic. You get what you pay for. Low price... low quality. I should have bought The more expensive Panasonic (slaps fore head. I'd like to give it Zero stars.
2,No Power,"Sturdy enough for the price, but no power. Replaced original battery with a new duracell. Still fuctioned like the battery was drained. Like I mentioned before, what do you expect for the price."
2,Not Real Pleased,"The motor seems to be strong, but it just doesn't do that good of a job. It seems to have difficulty reaching hairs because of the small opening for the blade."
4,They work well,I compared all sorts and this one seemed to be the best of all of them. We are very happy with them. Small and easy to use.
4,Your Basic Little Trimmer,I choose this trimmer as it was very well rated on Amazon. It replaced an old one that became unoperatable after several years of service. The Andis 13430 performs very well and matches it's description from Amazon. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a personal trimmer.
2,Does not work reliably,"The Andis 13430 Trimmer I received does not work reliably. When I turn the switch on, nothing happens. After I check the battery connections and the blade cover, still nothing. I changed the battery for a known fresh battery, still nothing. Once or twice, I was able to get it to turn on by gently tapping it against my palm. When that happened, it stayed on until I turned it off and seemed to trim as expected. After sitting in the drawer, though, it always didn't work upon the next attempt to use. If it would turn on reliably, the trimmer seems that it would have met my needs."
2,Oliver! Could have been Better...,"This 1960 London Cast Recording of Lional Bart's classic Oliver! is a little on the weak side of things. The orchestrations are often to noisy and chaotic, and the singing/ shouting give you a headache after a while. Georgia Brown needs to soften her voice while protraying a lovable charcter such as Nancy. The only cast member that sticks out is Fagin portrayed by Ron Moody , Moodys portrayal of the character is perfect and he knows how to balance the serious / comedic sides of the role. Don't get me wrong Oliver! is a great musical at which is near to my heart but this recording needs a change for the better. I would prefer the 1994 Revival London Cast Recording of Oliver! rather than the original."
1,The Authors Review,"I am the author and copyright owner of this book. As such I am responsible for editing, spelling, formating, and content including text, graphics, covers etc. This is the first book I have ever written and I made the mistake of not testing the market before having it printed. I sent copies of the printed volume to college professors, school teachers both public and private, and church leaders. These were all friends of mine. The professors did not respond at all. The school teachers said that they liked it but would not use it because they were afraid of law suits or they diagreed with my usage of Biblical quotes. The church leaders were too busy to read it. In the previous review I blamed the publisher for what were clearly my errors and I am sorry for my statements about Winepress Publishing. There is clearly no market for this book. It should be taken off the market, and no more copies printed. James H. Oliver, Jr."
1,not worth it at any price,"This book has many spelling errors, paragraphs out of order and quotations with incorrect refrences. The publisher did a very poor job of proof reading this text."
5,a really funny book (a review by Eli age 7),"This is a really funny book. The tow main characters are Freddy Fafnaffer (the nice one) and Mr. Frimdimpny (who is in charge of this book). I like Freddy Fafnaffer the most because he is very funny. the book has a few funny stories in it. My favorites are ""a nice nap"" and ""The best dressed man"". I like the cartooning illustrations. This is a great book."
4,Hilarious,That is what my 6 year old son thinks. Especially after I turned back to the front of the book after he started laughing and started over. That was the funniest thing ever. We finally made it through to the end of the book after he clamped his hands over his mouth and I prudently ignored the muffled giggles coming from behind the hands. He wants to read it again tomorrow.
1,Not For Reading To Others,"This has to be the dumbest book I have ever read. Perhaps it is due to the fact that my 3-year-old didn't 'get it'. You start to read the book and it says if you laugh you 'must' return to the front of the book (by order of the cranky crock). Fortunately for us my son and I found no humor in any of the situations so we didn't have to go back, but if you do have to 'go back' there are no instructions as to what to do then. Do you read everything all over again? Naturally I know you don't REALLY have to return to the beginning, however the book is lame. There is no plot, no story- just a couple of 'funny' situations awkwardly introduced by a 'nice' pig and not-so-nice reptile (crock or gator? I don't remember). Perhaps for an older child it could be fun, but not for reading to a little one. Lame, lame, lame..."
4,Spacemen 3 - 'For All The F***ed Up Children Of This World We Give You...' (Sympathy For The Record Industry),"First hit the streets in 1984, as this is said to be Spacemen 3's first 'proper' album release. Believe up to now, I've only heard their live and compilation titles. Good neo-psych / space rock classic from the trio. Tracks I liked best were ""2:35"", ""Fixin' To Die"" and this title's exclusive cut (couldn't find it on any other CD) ""T.V. Catastrophe"". This CD reissue has two different edits of both ""Things'll Never Be The Same"" and ""Walking With Jesus"" (one of my personal favorites). Do keep in mind that 'For All The...' DOES in fact have a rather primitive sound to it, compared to their other numerous discs. Still, I personally feel it's a should-have."
4,Sense Music before the point was completely made,"The psychedelic era was not just about paisley shirts and flowery scarves. The mentality behind it was traveling without leaving; exploring space by staying in your living room. Spacemen 3 were able to expand that with old sounds filtered through a new mentality and new drugs. The mentality was that through repetition you could put the body into a trance; it was all auditory. This was where the experiment began. Spacemen 3 recorded these songs before they even had a record contract or more than 10 songs, but they allow glimpses of the greatness to come. If you have not heard any Spacemen 3, you may want to check out Perfect Persription or Sound of Confusion first to get a feel and then come back to this. This set of songs is where it all began for these Rugby lads. The songwriting is a a little choppy and the lyrics are repetive. But that was the point in the first place."
3,dics problem,I enjoyed the episodes in season 9 that I was able to watch. However disc 4 and 5 were defective in my first set and disc 4 in the second set I got from Amazon still would not play. Seems that I am the only person who has complained about this problem-- at least that is what Amazon told me. Anyone else have this problem?
2,Ruined disc,When I need to relax I do it by watching these old video episodes of the old Hawaii five-0. I recognise the way of living and enjoy looking - and laughing at the stories. Though by not checking every disc to be allright prior to running them I discovered too late that one disc was ruined at the purchase. It is impossible to see any of the episodes of disc six. Make sure this doesnt happen to you.
4,HD wide angle lens,Good addition to the hdr-hc1 HD camcorder; especially for indoors where you would want to get more people in the shot. A bit pricey and hard to find since Sony discontinued the hdr-hc1 but amazon pricing was the best around.
5,"GE 11339 - LU70/MED - 70 Watt High Pressure Sodium Light Bulb, Medium Base","GE 11339 - LU70/MED - 70 Watt High Pressure Sodium Light Bulb, Medium BaseI was not able to find this product at either Lowes or Home Depot. The bulb(100 watt) I did find at Home Depot cost $7.00 more than this product. Very pleased."
4,A good start in learning some Alice!,"Although it's considered by many critics to be the worst outing by the Seattle area grunge band, I personally believe it's one of my favorites. The songs may not be as tight as on ""Dirt,"" but groundwork for what would become Alice in Chains is evident in the guitar tab here. Songs like ""Man in the Box"" shine through and compliment the drudging rockers like ""We Die Young"" perfectly. This book is tabbed out fairly well, and serves as a nice addition for anyone wanting to take a look at the guitar style of Jerry Cantrell."
2,Disappointing toy,"I am a big fan of Fisher Price toys, but this one was a waste of money in my opinion. It's not very sturdy, and the hoop gets stuck down if the baby pulls on it. The music is cute and the colors are bright and interesting to a baby. The balls aren't too small, so you don't have to worry about a choking hazard. But it's just not an interesting enough toy to keep a baby's attention. My son had more fun throwing the balls, then using them for the toy. This pretty much collects dust in my house."
5,Daddy and Baby love this toy!,"We got this as a baby gift when our son was a newborn. My husband is a HUGE basketball fan and would hold our son in his lap and play with this game. (I think he liked it as much as our son liked it!) Over the months, as our son developed, he became more and more adept with the toy. Now a toddler, it's his favorite toy of all time! I'm not sure that it would be great for a child older than maybe 15 months, but for the younger crowd, it's just terrific."
2,Don't bother...,"This thing makes fun sounds, but it's too complicated for a little guy (mine is 11 months) and too small for a bigger kid. Also, my son wants to use it to lean on and pull up on and it just falls over on him. Don't bother with it."
1,BORING,"We got two of these as gifts for our son's first birthday. I thought he'd love it so much that instead of returning one to the store I decided to keep it at my office so he'd have something to play with there. Big Mistake! He was never interested in this toy -- we already had a Stand-Up Ball Blast, which he LOVED, and the only thing he ever did with this was try to put the balls from it into the Ball Blast (the basketballs are just big enough to get stuck in the Ball Blast). We got rid of this toy and he never even noticed it was gone. As other reviewers have said, it is nowhere near as sturdy as the Ball Blast for pulling up on. If I had it to do over I would exchange these gifts for something else."
2,Not worth $,"My daughter loves music, lights and spinning things. I figured she would go nuts over this toy. However, she barely even looked at it. My daughter is 27 months, but developmentally delayed. You can drop the balls through the center hole and music does play. The two holes on the sides are hard for her to get the balls into because you dont DROP the balls down through the holes. They go horizontally through the holes. I am disappointed with this toy. I wouldn't recommend this toy."
3,Our little guy likes it.,"Our son got this for his first birthday. He loves the music,and pushing the balls through the holes. This toy does have some weaknesses :it is easy to knock over and the ball tend to get stuck. It would be nice if it the support pole was adjustable,so the toy could be used when the child gets older or for tall 1 year olds. All in all it's an ok toy."
2,NOT WORTH BUYING,"When we bought this toy for our 8 month old son, we thought he was going to love it...he didn't. Within the first night he broke the net off, which will never go back correctly. He is easlily able to knock the whole thing over. The balls sometimes get stuck inside and you have to reach in to get them. Overall I would say it is not worth buying. My son is now 15 months and still finds it boring and it is just not sturdy enough."
1,"Mediocre Writing, poor quality photos","nowhere near picture perfect. Not sure if it's poor technology (by Amazon, I read this book on Kindle) or reproduction, but photos look bad. writing so so."
3,It's Life Span is about 8 months,"I've had three of these, and I'll be getting another. It's the only way I can protect the carpet that it sits on. I don't weigh 300 pounds, so I can't really explain why it cracks and then falls apart after eight or so months. It's expensive, but I suppose it's less expensive than a new carpet.It's now October 2007, and I've gone through another one. It's fully cracked and has no more than two week's life left."
5,Guitar room completed!,I made a special room for my husband and hung his guitars up. These are great hooks. They come with the hardware and are very easy to install. The hooks have rubber on them so they won't harm the guitars. They also pivot so the guitars hang perfectly from their natural weight.
3,Not As Good as the Serial,"This movie is alright as a feature of a Serial but the cutting is drastic and the plot becomes quite uneven. The serial works best as the Rangers are killed off one by one until the actual Lone Ranger emerges, but in this feature everything is so truncated that the excitement is lost. The Movie rates 3 stars only because of the wonderful work of Lee Powell, Hal Taliaferro and Chief Thunder Cloud. If you can't find the serial this is fine, but if you can get the serial you will see the difference."
2,Not Quite,"All true Lone Ranger fans will be disappointed. There is no ""..Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, etc."" The announcer isn't at the end either, so obviously this is not for the serious collector. Even the serial is an edited version. It does not mean this DVD is without merit: it is better than nothing. But if you can wait or already have these on tape, save the money. Oh, for the day when real pristene copies, unedited, will be available. Question: why do people who don't really care about the Lone Ranger, make these things anyway?"
2,Bio-Blah,"Initially intrigued with this book, I quickly lost interest. It starts out well but then degenerates into a bunch of random points which the author tries to use to argue his hypothesis that the universe was designed to give rise to intelligent life as a final outcome. The blurbs along the margin were major distractions & made it hard to stay focused on the actual material in the book. The book just kind of wanders around the various fields of science trying to find evidence to support the author's premise and then ends with the pronouncement that we're the peak of creation (very Genesis-like). I'd have to pronounce this book mildly interesting if you can wade through the claptrap and the biased agenda."
5,Biocosm: Fresh New Ideas on the Question of Existence,"For centuries science has wrestled with the question of how our amazingly complex, life-filled, universe could have formed without the aid on an outside intelligence. Biocosm proposes the most surprising answer of all, that life itself provided the intelligence that created our bio-friendly universe.The central hypothesis of the book is that at some time in the future, intelligent beings will have the capability of creating universes with the precise characteristics required to spawn life. Whether or not you buy this thesis, Biocosm presents a kaleidoscope of scientific possibilities so advanced that it makes Star Trek look like a buggy ride.Gardner does an admirable job of weaving together relativity, evolution and complexity theory in a way that keeps the reader glued to each page. The result is a scientific roller coaster that stretches the readers concepts of time, space and intelligence beyond the limits of imagination."
3,Gundam model Destiny,"This was not what I was expecting... I recently purchased the Master Grade ""Blast Mode"" version of this model and wanted some duplicate parts, but while this is the same scale and same Gundam robot, the model parts are far different, and not interchangeable (the gun on the back is significantly smaller).The model is nice and detailed, but pales next to the Blast mode version, but at half the price it's a good buy. However... If you want the most intricate version short of the 1/60 grade... go with the Blast mode!Gundam MG Destiny Gundam Extreme Blast Mode Scale 1/100"
2,Not what I hoped for,"I haven't seen Robotech on TV, I don't own the videos, but I thought I would give the game a chance. The graphics seem to be off, but I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is off about them. The gameplay is monotous, and after a while, I really didn't even care if I completed the game or not. Control is not the best in the world as the layout changes from mode to mode to mode to mode, and you have to change from mode to mode to mode to mode. It just doesn't offer anything new, what is the same in this game is not done as well as in other games, and it seems like the Gamecube hardware was just not used as well as it could, or even should, have been."
3,Rent it,"this game is okay, the graphics is the cell shading crap but that makes sense in a game like this. cell-shading does not make sense in a zelda game (wind waker)............Rent itim not 12"
3,Not much Cel-Shading,"People said there would be cel-shading.What!?I don't see any except for the explosions and black out-line on buildings and stuff but not any fighters.For me,this game is extremely boring,espicially the two player mode.Except for a few space battles and big city battles.I can't believe I wasted so much money on this game without renting it.For now on I believe everyone should rent before they buy.I'm not any fan of the Robotech series so that is why I don't like this game alot.Trust me,whoever says that this game is one of most exiting and best games they ever played,they are totally crazy or they never played a 3D action game before."
3,As Good As It Gets I Guess,"Well the reviewers are right. This is probably the best it's gonna get for now, so if you like the series, definitely play this one. The missiles are fun and the jet mode is amazing but it all gets old fast. The missions get monotonous and, even though their are three modes which sounds like endless fun, that too gets old fast. To me and my opinion, more types of weapons and more styles of veritechs, not just paintjobs either whoop-te-do, would have made the game more interesting."
2,LEAKY Bingo Daubers,Overall slightly dissatisfied. The daubers are really runny and sometimes leak out from the cap. Out of the 6 pack I think there were 2 daubers that seemed alright. Just a little disappointed in it.
2,Bingo markers,These bingo markers are colorful. Unfortunately too much paint comes out and they are too messy for use by small children. They need more a color variation as well.
3,Mildly Enjoyably Kung Fu,"If you like kung fu movies, you'll probably get some mild enjoyment (keyword: mild) out of ""Chinese Hercules."" It's about a guy who kills his fiance's brother. Feeling awful about it, he runs off to start a new life and a new identity, vowing never to kill again. But, this being a kung fu movie, you can be damn sure there's gonna be some serious a$$ whuppin' by the time it's done. Bolo ""Enter the Dragon"" Yeung is heavily hyped on the box (and the movie's title, ""Chinese Hercules,"" is actually one of his nicknames), but he actually only plays a small role as a henchman.The DVD I got is from Front Row Entertainment. The image is pan and scan, heavily cropped from the film's probable 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is extremely bad - very, very faded and scratchy. The sound is dubbed. While purists might complain, I sometimes get a kick out goofy dubbed dialogue. Unsurprisingly, there are no extras."
1,Bridge 3000,"I had great difficulty installing this game. It continuely froze my computer. After installation when playing the game it would freeze up my computer. I tried installing it on several computers with the same result. Received multiple emails from the tech support department of big city games, I did everything they recommended still with no results."
5,REPRINT!,"I managed to borrow a copy via interlibrary loan, but I'd love to have a copy on my bookshelf. I do believe that a reprint is in order."
5,A Meditation On Chess Themes Than A Primer On Improvement,"The book is interesting primarily as a example of grandmaster style thinking about calculating variations, judging opening repertoires, middle pitfallls, and basic endgame knowledge. But be warned: it is not a primer. The author has not devised a ""chess study plan"" for self-improvement. Anyone looking for commandments about calculating move sequences, avoiding time trouble (""just don't get in it""), opening choices, detailed strategic planning, etc., should be looking at books specifically aimed at giving a program. This book is more like listening to a knowledgeable Grandmaster lecture at a quiet chess club, sipping some wine and discussing topics."
4,"Really a ""practical"" approach to chess","A good book that covers a lot of practical aspects of chess, the material spread is somewhat to much for my taste, but the pages are all full of useful hints."
2,Wrong Guide,not for 1973 Buick Riviera this manual is for a front wheel drive car. I was re funded the cost thanks.
5,Why don't they make this anymore?,"Though it's rare that someone can say they love their alarm clock, I LOVE THIS CLOCK! It has exactly the right combination of features for my purposes--two alarms, progressive buzzer (effective but not irritating), adjustable snooze, and an easy-to-use nap timer. The illuminated red numerals are clear and readable both day and night, but do not project light or keep me awake. The forward and back buttons make setting the time/alarms foolproof.I've been using this clock continuously for four years, and it is only now starting to wear out. I've searched high and low for a comparable clock and just cannot find one anywhere. Westclox, please bring back this clock!"
5,prom night DVD review,i think the PROM NIGHT DVD was great i havent seen it in any stores in my area. and i found it on amazon.com great job guys. eric foster
3,The 80's,"Typical 80's movie, grew up in the 80's so I have a special fondness for the horror films of that time. And anyway who could miss another Jamie Lee Curtis horror film, she was the queen of 70's-80's horror. Cheesy killings with more teenagers (sign of the times) but I nice remainder of the good old days of simple killing."
5,joycemarie58,Very pleased with it. Jamie Curtis has always been one of my favorite actresses. She is awesome in horror films.
4,Great 80's Slasher,"Prom Night is in my opinion a great film. Jamie Lee is the scream queen!! She plays Kim the main character, who's twin sister died when she was 8 years old, in a tragic accident, when some kids pushed her from a window. Now the kids, including Kim are high school age, and all getting ready for the prom, but there is a killer who wants to dance the final dance with all of them. The music is actually post disco, the rest of the actors are decent. Jamie Lee is great in this early 80's slasher classic!"
1,Poorest DVD Quality Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this film as I'm a big fan of B/grade horror and slasher films. This is just the poorest quality transfer I have ever seen!!!!!! Amazon you should be ashamed to even stock DVD's with such poor quality. I sent an e-mail to your customer service after I received this purchase and they just avoided the topic in their reply!!!!I see now you're advertising a new version to be released Oct '07. Hope this copy is better!!!
2,"The three S's - Sex, Slashy, and Scary","Curtis did good in this low-key but not bad performance. I must tell you that the movie is very predictable, but there's some fun to be had. If I were the director, I would know how to spice it up and make it more interesting. But there's some stupid people out there who would LOVE this movie."
1,I WASTED MONEY,I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AT THE STORE BECAUSE IT WAS IN A CASE WITH HALLOWEEN FOR TEN BUCKS SO I GOT IT. IT WAS SO BORING AND CONFUSING. THIS IS JAMIE LEE CURTIS'S WORST MOVIE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
3,"an ok ""slasher"" movie but only if you like ""slasher"" movies","jamie lee curtis is the only thing about this movie worth a look really! ms. curtis is very beautiful and you can't help but watch her,but she's not on screen that much and the horror part of the movie is a little ""underdone"" if you ask me.years ago small kids playing a game cause a playmate to fall and die,they hide it and now years later at the prom the person who saw the killing is after payback.nothing new here just the same old thing!"
3,why doesn't everyone like this movie? it's FUNNY!,"This movie started off quite creepily (""The killers are coming!"") with '70's girl falling out the window, and the eerie phone calls and all, but then it just gets funny and far-fetched, like the loser guy in the van, the decapitation scene (I remember rewinding that over and over the first time), the extended disco dance sequence, and that random escapee who everyone thinks is doing the murders which is completely out in left field. This is movie is horrible, and it's fun as all get-out! See it now!!!!"
2,Really Disappointed,"Wow. I was really excited to order this movie, but it's not good. First of all, NO BONUS FEATURES. Secondly, we don't see the killer slashing anyone until towards the end of the film. Also, this film is trying to hard. It's a combo of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Carrie', 'Halloween', and even... 'Saturday Night Fever'! Jamie's face looks kinda strange, too. And when the killer is revealed it's not a real big surprise. Just not good."
2,really a 2 and 1/2 star,"A pretty standard ""who's killing the teens?"" movie. Nothing great about it, but it is not a bad movie. Would have given it 2 1/2 stars if available."
3,"""I'll see you at the prom...""","An axe wielding maniac stalks four friends on prom night, six years after they accidently killed a playmate. The young victim's father (Leslie Nielsen) and siblings (Jamie Lee Curtis & Michael Tough) try to put on a happy face for the prom, but there's an ominous figure lurking in the shadows. No explicit sex and the blood is kept to a minimum, but this isn't terribly invigorating, either. Watchable, and Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance as usual. A few good scares. All of the following sequels are in-name only."
3,slasher fims of the day,I am just a big fan of early 80's slasher fims..a must for your colection of horror films
4,Saturday Night Cleaver...,"In 1974, a 12 year old girl is killed during a game of hide and seek. Six years later, someone has decided to avenge her death by bumping off the (now 18 yo) kids who caused the tragedy. The killer starts by phoning all of the intended victims and threatening them in a whispery voice. He then dons a ski mask and sets out on his mission to wipe them all out. Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween 1 and 2, The Fog, Terror Train) plays Kim, the prom queen, and Leslie Nielson (Day Of The Animals, Creepshow) is her dad. It's time for senior prom, and Kim and the rest of her class are dying to dance! Meanwhile, the killer stalks the night, picking off victims. I like PROM NIGHT, it moves along quickly and Ms. Curtis is always quite watchable! I recommend watching PN as a double feature w/ CARRIE..."
3,Clichéd!,"Oh come on Jamie. Must you be in EVERY clicéd horror movie? This one goes down to even having the school bully, the slut, and the creepy janitor. Only the killer was a bit of a surprise for me."
3,the movie was okay,This movie is okay. I think the cover is more scarier then the movie. I give it 3 stars because the actors and the movie makers at least tried. They almost made it. I think that the movie stalls in revealing the killer. But over all is was okay.
3,Surprisingly disappointed,"I am a big fan of Curtis's earlier scream queen movies, and after seeing ""Halloween,"" ""Terror Train,"" and even ""The Fog,"" I decided to check this one out. Sad to say, it was pretty mediocre. The only exciting part was when the killer was chasing one of the girls through the dark school while everyone was disco-dancing at the prom. I would expect the climax to be like that, but sadly, it wasn't. It was a two minute--maybe one minute--fight scene with the killer, Curtis, and Curtis's prom date. I found myself waiting for--and not receiving--the thrills that ""Terror Train"" and ""Halloween"" had, both of which had me holding my breath. Anyhow, skip over this one on the shelves at Blockbuster. You will be very disappointed, especially if you are looking for the thrill of ""Halloween."""
3,What a wallflower!,"This Prom could have used some spiked punch! It starts with a bunch of kids playing in an abandoned warehouse. Little, tag-along sister falls out a second story window and dies. The remaining kids make a pact to never speak of this again. Six years later on the anniversary of the lil' kid's death, on which date the Big Prom Event is also taking place, someone starts to stalk and kill the irresponsible punks who never reported their evil deed. Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the dead girl's older sister and Leslie Nielsen plays it straight as her father and the local principal but it's Ann-Marie Martin who gets the most points for her portrayal of the catty Wendy, really the only entertaining person in the film. I'll bump it from 2 to 3 stars just for her.There is scarce blood, less suspense, paltry thrills and a complete and tragic lack of nekkid, rutting teens so I'd give this one a pass unless you're an 80's slasher fan or a Jamie Lee Curtis completist."
3,Prom Night,"Fairly good movie,but a bit ""jerky"" with the storyline.Acting was acceptable for the genre.Overall,not ""that bad"" viewing."
2,A Real Disappoinment,I thought this movie was a real dispointment. I love Jamie Lee Curtis but I just found this movie terrible. And confusing....
1,A parody of itself- what a bad movie!,"I rented this movie because, like everyone else has said, Halloween wasn't bad and I was in the mood for a horror film. Not only was this more gory, it also had very little plot, lackluster characters, annoying disco music (they spend almost 10 minutes on a disco dance scene that should never have been put into the final cut), and TERRIBLE acting. The characters are very fake and even if the movie would have been entertaining just to see people die the death scenes are not even that creative. The script is terrible and the events seem very random. Don't waste your time watching this [junk] go do something fun and pluck your eyebrows instead."
2,Just a Halloween clone,"A typical story about four young kids that accidentally kill someone and get stalked by a killer angered for revenge. The idea has been done to death, not scary or entertaining. Still not the worst of it's genre, but thats nothing possitive."
4,"well made clone of ""Halloween""","Well, let me start by saying that I loved Halloween, so I thought I might rent this one. Extremely well made with great plot and gore galore (after a slow start). I really liked the bit where that fellow's head rolled down the catwalk."
4,This movie is a classic,"""Tonight, its your turn."" PROM NIGHT is a great teeny bopper film with classic killings from a geeky boy that saw his sister murdered by classmates when he was little. i think the best part of this movie is the the guy that gets his head chopped off at the prom and it roles down the stage."
1,My GOD! Did this suck...,"There are not even WORDS to describe how STUpid this movie was...When I read the synopsis on the back of the movie at the video store, I had a TOTally different picture of what this was soppoused to be about!...When I found out this movie was going to be on T.V. VERY late last night, I thought <gasp!> JoY! I'd FINally be able to actually SEE it! Okay...It's starting out a little slow...No, VERY slow...Okay, HERE comes a Scary Part!...THAT was IT?!?! Theres a VERY low body count, NOBODY gets killed 'till 20 minutes to the end, and the only REMOTELy scary thing about it was when the prom-king gets his head chopped off! Also, it was TOO dark! I could BARELY make out what was happening the whole time! On a high note, the Disco Music was AWESOME, and so was the whole dance-floor setup!===Another Thing===How come on the movie case it shows Jaime Lee Curtis wearing a tiara and dress that looks NOTHING like it did in the movie, and carrying an axe?!?!"
2,Sequell Is Better.,"Prom Night is about a group of kids who accidentally kill another kid and swear they will never tell anyone. Then years later at their prom, strange things happen and people start to be killed off.Quite frankly, I like the sequel A LOT better (part 2, ""Hello, Mary Lou"") fans of Jamie Lee Curtis will probably enjoy this film, or fans of Leslie Nielson or maybe someone who wants to see Leslie doing a serious acting role, instead of his trademark slapstick routines. But I just cant accept Jamie Lee Curtis in a teen role. I don't have anything against her or anything, it's just she looks the same then as she does now... it's like she doesn't fit in as a teenager when I see her as someone much more mature.There isn't much to say about gore and blood, it's pretty tame. The sequel is a little more satisfying in that department. But the sequel has nothing to do with this film.It's a pretty average thriller."
3,Jamie and Leslie Are The Only Good Points Of This Movie!,When it comes to horror flicks and 80's flicks Prom Night isn't too good of a movie and the only good that comes out of the movie is the alawys superb Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson and they are the only reason why this movie doesn't get rating of 1 star.
3,Prom Night not bad but not for everyone,The only reason i saw this movie in the first place is because i saw jamie lee curtis was in it so i thought it couldnt be that bad because i loved halloween and terror train. I also thought it was funny that leslie nielsen was in it. I saw wrongfully accused not long before that so i though it was funny seeing leslie try to do a serious role. The plot of this movie is about a group of kids who accidentally kill a fellow classmate while playing a game and then make a pact never to tell anyone about it. Years pass and then its time for the kids senior prom. Leslie Nielsen plays the schools principal he is also the murdered girls father. Jamie lee plays the girls sister and Leslie's daughter. While at the prom an on looker of the murder years back is there to seek revenge and one by one murders the victim's killers. Good who done it kind of movie. Mostly recommended just for fans of jamie lee or a good slasher flick.
4,Excellent resource for glass toothpick holder collectors.,"Beautiful book with full color pictures of each holder. Brief history of each company is included and holders are easily located under the company name. Layout is very attractive and ample space is afforded each collectible. Entries include the original manufacturer's name, date, colors, size, special notes, along with prices. The back of the volume contains a large section on ""Unattributed and Unknown Makers"" that can assist you in identifying lesser known holders. This book is a nice addition to your library. Well researched and a joy to use."
1,a pain to use,"I bought this a few years ago because i used an earlier version & had liked it a lot, but I found this difficult to use because it has something like 6 CD's that you have to insert in order to find clipart images. A real pain! I think I tried to use it maybe 3 or 4 times before I got totally fed up with all the disc changes."
3,LBT HSMT-UD 5.1 USB Headphones,"These headphones are good for gaming and movie watching on a portable (I've been using them for a few hours) but their mediocre audio quality (poor low and mid range frequency response) are no substitute to listening to music with a high quality set of headphones--I use Grado 225s. I listened to a portion of Sade's new release and, despite the individually chambered speaker drivers, or perhaps because of it, there is a muddiness to the music.There is decent surround sound separation, probably almost as good as it gets for headphones, I don't know, for playing a game or watching a film where volume must be kept at a minimum, I easily recommend these headphones for the price. I purchased at buy dot c0m for $13. Hope this review helps."
4,"Great Headphones, but would have preferred a regular audio connector than USB","I didn't realize until I got them that, because they are USB (and maybe this is different per computer setup or I'm just an idiot) I can't have sound pumped through the headphone AND any other speakers connected to my machine at the same time, nor can I alternate between headphones and speakers easily without more electronics to facilitate the switch.Aside from this annoyance the headphone provide excellent surround sound quality, especially considering how low the price is. When these break, I'm never going USB again, but I would consider LTB again."
2,Good but not great!!,I bought these about three months back.These worked ok for a couple of months and then they made some strange squeaking sounds now and then.Not very comfortable on the ear too. Tried to contact LTB customer care but they never responded.Buy it at your own risk.
4,Great value for the money and feather light,"When I first opened the box I was surprised by the small size of the headphones compared to the previous 5.1 ""tank"" headphones that I had before. The headphones fit perfectly on my head and are a pleasure to wear due to their size and lightweight. You may even forget that you have them on.Audio quality is good for the mostpart although I did notice that the sound in one of the channels seems to be a little ""flat"" compared to similar models. It could just be me though. Bass seems to be good for most situations and isn't too overpowering. Overall these seem like a good set to experience 5.1 channel audio without distubing others around you."
3,ok for the money,"strength: easy installation, plug and play, no special driver needed. good spacial effect.weakness: unlike the previous reviewers, I was not that impressed with the sound quality. not much of bass sound."
1,"Robo-TRASH: ""Make YOU Cry"" if you buy it!","Avoid this dog-pile... Look, lots of people like lots of different things. I HATE THIS GAME. I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. The graphics are crappy, the game play is utterly repetitive. Did these jokers spend any time designing this product? You will need to be a real die-hard fan type of person to enjoy this more than a few minutes. You cannot turn into the flying mode at will. That sucks. And the graphics look like a kid's coloring book. Get yourself a used copy of ""Mechassault"" or even ""Battle Engine Aquila"" & you'll be better off."
4,"Good graphics, not much gameplay","Actually, I had a chance to play this game even further, and it is okay. The graphics are excellent, but the execution of the camera angles doesnt do enough to show off the detail. This game could have been a lot better with a little more tweaking on the gameplay, but it is still fun if you are willing to get past the first few stages, which are extremely boreing."
2,"Works for some, but not all","Well this alarm clock wakes some people up but not all. I have some hearing loss and thought that this clock would be loud enough to get me going in the morning. I was wrong... Because of the alarm is such a high pitch I couldn't hear it, but it woke my boyfriend up or rather scared him awake.So if your hearing is normal or you can hear high pitches this little clock is great.If your hearing is not normal and you can't hear high pitches find a different clock"
1,You get what you pay for...,"This game goes for over $60 new?? Fortunately I paid $6 for it on ebay and even that seemed like too much. Here's why. I tried to instal it. That went fine. The screen, after I open the game and start it up however, flickers incessantly. There are no troubleshooting tips for how to fix this. I reloaded the game and even tried to instal that active x, but nothing. Thank you again Windows7, XP, Vista or whatever you are calling your crappy systems these days. Things were fine before these came along. Now I can hardly play any of my vid games that I so much enjoyed before: Medieval Toal Way, Age of Mythology, Classic Age of Empires, Empire Earth.....now this game is part of the slag heap."
1,More of the same from Slitherene,"This game is inferior to Slitherene's ""Spartan"" and ""Gates of Troy"". At least they had real Diplomacy and you could skip the silly battle action by using auto resolve. I have given Slitherene every chance, beginning with Legion Arena, Legion Gold etc. In doing so I have wasted a lot of money, and actually not even played beyond a few turns in some of the games once I saw what the game was all about. There is virtually no attempt at historical accuracy. The campaign maps are basically just variations on a the main theme. For someone who is used to the Total War and Stronghold type games, these games by Slitherene are a real come down. If you are older than 14 this game and most of the rest of what Slitherene puts out are not worth your time and money."
1,Not what it claims to be!,"This book is not what it claims to be i.e. "" . . . the best 1,000 Movies Ever Made"". It is merely a collection of all the reviews they could get their hands on presumably for free. Thay have some attrocious movies in it. And don't take my word for it - their own reviewers pan them mightily! Many of the reviews are decades old. Given that taste and opinions change that makes them of lesser interest. Find another book on the movies not this."
2,"Um, there have been films released since 1998...","This book is quite dated. It was published in 1999, and unless you want to focus on movies from 1931 to 1998, this is a poor choice.There is no good reason why this book has not be updated, such as ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"" which has been revised, adding 17 newer movies, and deleting 17 of the prior 1001 movies. (I wouldn't have minded them simply adding the 17 movies, without deleting any older movies.)Another good choice is Peter Travers' new ""1000 Best Movies on DVD."""
4,John Belushi deserves more respect!,"Animal House is clearly the best college movie ever made and many lines from the film are often quoted by all generations. Animal House deserves a place in the 1000 Best Films. In fact, no Animal House ripoff has been able to come close to capturing the overall success of all aspects of this movie. Even the soundtrack has gone down in movie history as one of the best ever. Who could forget the line: ""Eight years of college down the drain"", ""Double secret probation"", the cucumber scene or the Food Fight. Enough said."
1,Why include unavailable movies?,"This is going to be the shortest review I've ever written. I checked out this book from the library and photocopied the ""by genre"" list in the back. I checked off the ones I had seen (suprisingly few considering how long I've been an avid film fan.) Anyway, as I was going through the list I found the 1950's version of ""Death of a Salesman"" listed. Now, everyone who has ever looked for that film will tell you it's not available on home video. So, why include it? Anyone who dared to try and tackle watching even a fraction of the movies listed here would have to use another guide such as Leonard Maltin's just to ascertain wheather or not the film is available. I am thinking of looking into ""The best Films to Rent you've never heard of"" Its actually an achievable goal and at the very least you know the films are available."
3,Not that useful or enjoyable a reference tool,"While its potentially very interesting to see what the Paper of Record thought about the great films of the last seventy-five years, it's in reality often not very useful, since Bosley Crowther, the main Times reviewer for decades, was the most middlebrow of reviewers. He seemed baffled or unaffected by most of the films later scholars and even the better contemporary critics (like Sarris or Kael) have found important. His successor, Vincent Canby, was better, but again had very predictable enthusiasms (including his notorious fondness for Woody Allen, whom he seemed to believe could do no wrong). Only Canby's successor Janet Maslin seems a reviewer whose writings are worth collecting, and her takes on films of the Eighties and Nineties are what makes this collection in the end worth owning."
5,Wonderful stuff,"First off--Patrick Street is the artist of ""Music for a Found Harmonium,"" not Penguin et al. Secondly--wonderful soundtrack. Light, contemplative, whimsical. Good stuff."
5,A Great DVD,"This dvd was without a doubt one of the best Rurouni Kenshin DVD's for sure. I have watched Rurouni kenshin on Cartoon Network and I have loved it, but lately I've been collecting the DVD's, and this is one of my favorites only behind Shadow of the Wolf and Fire Requiem. I find the DVD's to be a bit pricey if they are only 4 episodes, however, this one is 5, and therefore very worth it. And for anyone who wants to sign a petition asking for the jinchuu arc to be animated, here you go: http://www.petitiononline.com/jinchuu/"
5,Cultural nutrition,"Before I purchased this book, I had this unquenchable thirst for how the carnival culture came to be in Trinidad & Tobago. What was canboulay? How did stickfighting originate? How did costumes come about? The music, the singing. As a Trinidadian, I felt it was my duty to have this knowledge. I spoke to my parents, older family members, calypsonians and anyone who had knowledge of our culture past and present. Then I bought ""Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso; Traditions in the making."" I couldn't put it down. There was an excitement in the learning process. I had no clue as to how Trinbago's culture evolved from then to now. I can only describe this book one way. ""Excellent!"""
4,Walk Away Renee,"I purchased this CD for its hauntingly beautiful version of the l960's song, Walk Away Renee. The music is dreamy and expressive, and it was well worth the extra money."
4,"Beautiful, raw side of Rickie Lee Jones","I bought this CD for the cut Walkaway Rene, my favorite version of this classic. But the entire performance is nice and melancholic."
5,One of her best!!,"You just don't have enough stars here!!. The phrasing in her singing that made her a hit storyteller is here with a vengeance. Songs that I adored to begin with (i.e. Walk away Rene, Funny Valentine, Rainbow Sleeves, Under the Boardwalk) are sung with that coolness and heart that was rare in the 80's. Everything was flashy, loud, synthetic, and pseudo-futuristic. Ricki Lee came out of the box with the cool, easy, relaxed storytelling of ""Chuckie's in Love"" and ""Youngbloods"" and never looked back. She doesn't have a great voice, (it's quirky and soft but she has range). It's just that she transports you easily with the way she delivers, whether it's her original works or not.The Left Banke's ""Walk Away Rene"" was a gem to begin with, but Ricki Lee's rendition shines it up, puts it in a setting, wraps it up and gives it as a present to us. It glistens, sparkles and touches your heart. This is an emotional journey worth taking."
2,Run Drew,"If anyone is looking for the song that plays while Drew Barrymore is running across the baseball field to Jimmy Fallon...its actually on the soundtrack...but it hides itself very carefully in fact.Its called ""Who Killed Tangerine"" by Tears for Fears. Just wait for it...wait for it...until the end...then you'll remember it.Hope this helps those of you that just want to find that song you're looking for and be done with it...not have to search through a thousand other songs before you finally find the one you were looking for inthe first place.and remember...its not over...it never was over."
2,No Bosstones? No Aerosmth? What????,"Boston is one of the greatest musics scenes known to man....Aerosmith may be the most famous band missing, but the ommission of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones is a travesty. At least they included ""Tessie"", the song made popular in 1918, and by doing so, they included the Dropkick Murphy's, another great Boston Band. But no Bosstones, Aerosmith, Guster, Aimee Mann, Pixies, Buffalo Tom, Slide (who released a CD in 95 or 96 entitled ""Forgiving Buckner""), Julian Hatfield, The Lemonheads, Chubby, or other great Boston Bands. Could have been an ode to Boston, instead, it was a joke."
2,No Aerosmith!,"How can you have a movie about Boston without the city's most famous band on the soundtrack(or in the movie for that matter)? Seriously though, this soundtrack is a bore."
2,You get what you pay for,"The picture looks like its solid glass however its a whole in stem. I can live with that but frankly they're cheap looking I should of spent more money and got something nice. Plus they came looking kinda dusty, maybe they will look better washed.If you looking not to spend much money (cheap) and want something a little different maybe this is for you."
4,it works..,"For the lower budget end of pop filters, this does the job. It stops 'plosives' (pops). Mechanically, it's a little funky, but sound."
4,"Once positioned, it works well","This improves recording quality pretty dramatically once positioned correctly in front of the mic. However, it offers a challenge sometimes to bend in the right way. It's stiff in certain positioned but usually not the one you desire upon first setup. It's manageable (i.e. takes about a minute to get situated), but aggravating momentarily."
2,Great Actors Waisted,"If you enjoy ultra close camera work in HD (which ultimately is suffocating-did the director ever study the great directors-yes, they did use a wide shot to great effect) then be my guest with this ""HEAVY"" film which leaves your memory as quickly as a Texas rainstorm. Please put this filmmaker in Director Hell for at least two years before wasting our (and the actors and crew's) time again."
4,Good Movie,"I didn't think I was going to like this movie mostly because I do NOT like Halle Berry but I love Benico Del Toro. And I really enjoyed this movie and Halle Berry made me like her a little bit : )Reading all these other comments people saying ""They didn't get it"" What's to get? It's real life...People die....People need help...People have addictions."
2,Heartbreaking,"Too heartbreaking to watch DD die, to watch a family broken, and Halle Berry not being with a hottie (dont get me wrong, Benicio Del Toro is a very good actor). Now, if only DD and Benicio switched characters....Mmmmm..."
4,Very good...,The best things about this movie is that the leads NEVER get together.Moving and powerful.
4,Help on the way,"There is not much to say about this movie really. It is a well made, well directed, well produced, well acted credible story of life, death and rebirth.Fine performances by all of the cast, touching, caring and thoughtful.And a happy ending to boot.What more could you want?"
3,Good movie.,A must watch movie for anyone that has been impacted by drugs or the death of someone close. Very well done.
3,"similar to the one I had as a child, but not identical","I ordered this CD after reading the other reviews, hoping this CD would be identical to my Disney tape I listened to a decade ago as a child. While some songs are identical (such as 12 days of Christmas) with the Disney ""crew"" singing (Goofy, Donald, Mickey), some of the other songs are NOT the same as I remember. ""Frosty the snowman"" doesn't have Goofy singing, nor does ""Jingle Bells"". I wonder why some of the songs are as I remember them, whereas others are missing the Disney gang. I'm disappointed, as I was hoping for the CD version of my Disney tape. Not a bad CD altogether, but it really isn't the same without Goofy and Mickey singing on all of the tracks."
5,Best Christmas CD ever,I recieved this Cd when I was young. I am now 18 and it brings back such good memories from christmas for me. I love this CD!
5,"great, great christmas album","This record definitely brings back moments of my childhood, when my family and I lived in Australia. I am 19 now and we live in Europe. I've still got the cassette, but its quality has obviously gone blunt. Since it is difficult to find a copy in the Netherlands, I can barely express how it felt when I did find one at Amazon.com. It was pure excitement! You should absolutely buy this record if you have kids. At any older age they will be thankful that you gave them this magical christmas experience."
4,spindrift model from land of the giants,"from the days this show was on tv it brings back memories and always liked the design ,for me its also a creative addition to my other collections of memorabilia. ."
2,Disappointing,"Saw a favorable review in Mojo Magazine and took a chance after hearing some samples on Amazon...Expected the rebirth of the Incredible String band but this is not even close...A lot of senseless screeching and howling set to minimalist instrumentation that could best be described as nature's version of a garage band...Really tedious listening and by the time the record is half over you are thinking, can there actually be more??? Keep in mind that I think the Incredible String band is probably the most innovative band to ever pick up instruments...That being said, even they had some nerve racking moments, most memorable to these ears was on Hangman's Beautiful daughter....Nothing there could compare to the lows encountered on this record...In some cases, it is almost completely devoid of structure or melody...Very disappointing....."
3,intense and very ok,"This is a very intense album but the music almost gets strangled in words but what can I say some of os want more music some of us want more words, it's a great album even though it's not my favorite I'm pretty sure that I'll buy all af the albums. Love the intensity."
1,Keep Searching,This battery lasts 'maybe' a day in my Cingular 3125 with very light use. Do yourself a favor and go buy the 1100mah battery that comes stock with the phone. It does cost more but well worth it. My old (new in 12/06) stock 1100mah battery that I was attempting to replace actually lasts longer than this 'new' one. Good Luck.
2,"Less flowery language, more character developmnent","The most exciting part of this novel is the afterward where Harlan tells the story of how,through his painstaking research, the story came about. If only his novel was that relevant and riveting. Instead, his tale is filled with flowery language, little character development (motivations often make no sense like the obsession between Hirsch and Ned). Never did I feel I was actually experiencing Charleston in the 20s; there is just not enough detailed description (which is sad since it appears the author is and excellent researcher/historian).I think a nonfictional account of his research for the book would have been a much better subject for the author."
3,Never Played It/Read It,"Isn't Wutang Tai Chi Chuan a style separate from Shaolin Chuan?I was under the impression that Wutang was internal, Shaolin, external.Don't know. Will buy it just to see the dilly-yo. Wutang owns all."
1,Completely USELESS!,"This is a truly horrible strategy guide. All it does is tell every charecter's moves, which is information already included in the game! You'd be better off spending this money on Kagero: Deception 2, the best Playstation game EVER! Bah!"
5,Spiritual Sisters,"Andrews brings together the spiritual autobiographies of three African American Christian women ministers: Jarena Lee, Zilpha Elaw, and Julia Foote. His historical introductions provide a solid foundation for the original texts. The original texts, united as they are in one place, demonstrate a remarkable convergence of themes, predominant among them the theme of identity in Christ overcoming shame and suffering in the world.While not everyone will perhaps agree with the decisions made by any of these three women ministers, everyone will be stretched by their lives and by their message.Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,"" ""Soul Physicians,"" and ""Spiritual Friends."""
4,Groundbreaking...,"Pioneers of electronica,Yaz or Yazoo as they were known in Europe, deliver a wholesome helping of eighties synth-pop that still sounds fresh today.Featuring the competent keyboard expertise of Vince Clarke(founding member of Depeche Mode)and a strong vocal performance from Alison Moyet this is a gem worth treasuring."
4,Great CD with Terrible Sound,After reading the reviews here on Amazon I picked up the import version of this CD. What all the prior reviewers have said is true. This is an excellent CD from beginning to end with maybe only a hiccup or 2 along the way.The sound quality on this CD stinks and I don't like it. I understand this is an older recording but the volume on this CD is super low. This is a CD in need of a remaster. I would think at this point they could just run it through some software to fix it but what do I know.
4,"Timeless, ageless vintage album","This is an amazing cd. Well ahead of its time. Still awesome today. Great original music, mixes and vocals. Well worth every penny."
5,YAZ Rocks!,"I heard Yaz's ""Don't Go"" one night on the radio on 1997, almost 16 years after its release and I've fallen in love with this group ever since. I was 15 at that time, with very different styles of music out there. Yet, Yaz's unique style did not fail to catch my attention. While it's rare for me to listen to a CD on its entirety, I have listened to Yaz's ""Upstairs at Eric's"" no less than twenty times. This is the very first 80's group that I've been able to identify myself with. Although this gem of recording does not faulter in any way, you may want to skip ""Except After C."" Other than that, I guarantee you'll be hooked. One my favorite songs on this CD is ""Midnight,"" ""Only You,"" ""Situation"" and ""Don't Go."" ""Upstairs at Erics"" is worth every single dime."
3,Name Nine,"I discovered the band YAZ last year during research on the birth control YAZ.Interested, I borrowed the CD from the library and loved it. Especially #9 ""TUESDAY"" had significant meaning for me.However when I purchased the CD it looked exactly the same as the one I have borrowed... yet upon listening to it realized that this track is different. (SITUATION)I haven't a clue why the discrepancy... if someone could help explain it to me (politely) or even how to go about getting a corrected copy, I would gladly rate the item higher. It really is a good album otherwise, but Track Ten is terrific!"
2,Doesn't hold up well.,"I loved this album when it first came out. In a fit of nostalgia, I bought the CD (the old tape I had owned was long gone). Alison Moyet has a fabulous voice but the music of Yaz is now unbearably dated. I played the CD once and blushed with embarrassment that I had ever liked this type of electronic pop music."
5,Excellent !!,"Very comprehensive, well documented book on women in science,; So far it is the only book I've read in that category; Full of data and yet not boring ! Highly recommended to all who want to understand the roots of women's exclusion from science and problems in gender inequality we are still experiencing today ! Margaret JW"
3,Don't mess with duck style!,"Not much of a story here. Cliff Lok is good at kung fu, so he opens a school. A nearby school wants to challenge Cliff Lok's school, so Lok has to fight them. Then both schools get in trouble with a brothel owner and Wilson Tong is sent in to kill everyone. It's a pretty bad movie, so luckily there are a lot of fights. The best part about this movie is the great cast. Taking on Cliff Lok is Lee Hoi san, Hsiao Ho and Wilson Tong. The movie is almost nonstop fights, and they get better as it goes along. Surprisingly, the best fight comes from Chan Lung. He does this crazy duck style and nobody can stop him.3/5I have this movie in theWu Tang 8 Diagram Collectionand the picture quality is decent."
2,"Pulls your hair, painful experience","I bought this product after visiting the manufacturer''s website, and by recommendation of a professional stylist. When I received it, I was very well impressed by the design, product color and overall appearance. However, when I tried it, I noticed that it pulled my beard hairs, and suddenly it became a very painful experience! I tried changing the batteries for new ones, using different combs, to no avail. Finally, I found that using my old Norelco trimmer combs it didn't pull my hairs. But eventually it does it sometimes, so it sleeps in my bathroom drawers now.I do not recommend it, although design is very nice and feels very comfortable in your hand."
2,Adequate,"These clippers server their purpose for grooming but merely does an adequate job for what I purchased it for. I purchased it for body grooming. Once I feel that I have gotten my money's worth, I'll be trashing it and buying a Wahl product."
5,Gorgeous!,"This is a beautiful book, which contains well written and very interesting stories along with lots of lovely recipes. The photos are very true to real life and it is a delight to read and absorb."
3,Review of a culinary journeyin Gascony,"I like this book, well written, terrific do-able recipes, it moves a long at a slow, meandering pace, rather like the Dutch barge the author bought.In all, a good read, with a good section at the back on cooking produce, and where to get them,-if you live in or near France, that is!"
1,Waste of money,"Yeah, I bought this cause it was cute. Bas mistake. I used it twice. It exploded. Oh okay, maybe I did something wrong. I decided to cook it in two minute intervals so it wouldn't get to hot. It STILL EXPLODED. I then threw it away. I have no idea how people get this to work. I'm using a cheapo crappy low watt microwave too.."
1,Should come with a warning,"Followed the instructions to a tee - and ended up with an exploding egg in the microwave .... I suppose it was cooked, but doesn't really count. Be warned, my eggs exploded within 45 seconds of starting to cook - and they recommend a soft boiled egg in 3 minutes !!!"
4,It takes longer than stated,"According to the manual, it takes 3 minutes for soft, and 5 minutes for hard boiled eggs. This is completely wrong.I boiled a medium size egg for 5 minutes; yolk wasn't cooked at all.6.5 to 7 minutes is for soft eggs, and 8-10 minutes will finally make hard boiled eggs. Timing can vary depending on the power level of your microwave.Anyhow, it's easy and fun to boil eggs this way. Boiley sure looks cute!!"
3,Need to be lower then 1000 watt to use this Egghead.,"Before I bought it, I didn't see the instruction that you have to use only 1000 watt or lower. After I received Egghead, it comes with the instruction inside. I read it and it says, do not use if the watts is 1000 or higher.I saw some reviews that it's exploded. May be they are using high wattage? so be sure to check your microwave watts.My microwave is 1400 watt and I cannot adjust to lower it. So, I haven't tried this yet. Looks like I need a new microwave with lower watts to use this."
3,Half works,"It works only about half of the time. I follow all of the directions (including using a less that 1000 watt microwave which lots of people forget) but only a couple of my eggs were hard boiled and the others were boiled but the yolk wasn't cooked all the way but sometimes it did cook most of the way. It is just temperamental but hopefully I will get the hang of it. Works sometimes, I like it overall."
4,Nice gadget,"I love it, just be sure to check the power of your microwave, so it comes out to you desire........ 4 Stars"
1,Don't install if you have 2 different Handhelds,"I bought this to protect my new Dell Axim, a replacement for my Palm Tungsten E (and a step up). The Axim is wireless enabled so I wanted to protect it. When I tried to install it, I ran into major issues. It automatically wanted to install to the Palm (seeing the Palm Desktop software). There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install. I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email. Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software. How stupid! I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet. Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke. I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact. I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste! Maybe it works great, but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out. Amazon was terrific and let me return the product!"
5,LOVED seeing Best Friends for the first time!! PS--no subtitles,"I really enjoyed seeing Best Friends for the first time; I've been a member for years. I could finally see people and places I've only read about. I couldn't have enjoyed the 3 included episodes more, and I'm about to order more of the Dogtown sets. I'd love to see a DVD about the cat side too, in case anybody with any clout to produce one is reading!!BTW, there don't appear to be any subtitles on this title, so you'll want to keep that in mind if they're important to you. I can't vouch for presence or absence of closed captions because I don't have a chip."
2,confusing,"I'm not a numbers person, so maybe that's why it didn't work for me, but I tried, believe me I tried and it was confusing. Figuring out the formulas just didn't work. I think their instructions weren't clear enough."
3,When I was a kid..,"Saw this movie when I was a kid and kept have recollections of the ""Devil with a blue dress"". Watched it again and found it to be only mildly entertaining."
2,It won't excorcise too much laughter...,"This 'comedy' horror spoof is perhaps, one of the lamest I've ever seen. King of spoofs, Leslie Nielsen is a very funny guy, and he is funny in this. BUT!... the comical plot to this film is just plain stupid. The gags are cheap and afterwards, you can't help but feel it could have been better. Totally Disapointing!"
5,"Funny, but the cursing was a little uneccesary.","I thought that Repossessed was really funny! It should have been the funniest horror comedy of the year 1990. I was extremely impressed on how they made very funny and well thoughtout jokes. It was a little crazy mixed in with a little funny! I wish they would make a sequel of it. If you want to see this than you have to watch The Exorcist, Possessed, or Poltergiest. They all have to pretty much cover the whole story about Repossessed."
2,Jeez...,"Wow, this film, it is well...cheesy. I am an absolutely HUGE Exorcist fan, but this spin-off, well, stinks. Leslie Nielson tries WAY too hard to be funny but he just doesn't deliver. All the comedy seems forced and will probably make you cringe. To tell the truth, I thought the film was kinda scary - nothing compared to The Exorcist of course but still...Linda Blair was good and pretty as always but - sheesh, don't waste you're time. Go watch the glorious original Exorcist instead of this any day of the week."
2,"Decent for ' Exorcist ' Lovers, Pathetic for Blair","Okay it was a spoof. But most people found it pathetic that Linda Blair used comedy to hang onto her one shot at fame. Linda was not funny in this film at all. If it weren't for Leslie Nielson I wouldn't have wasted my time. I loved LN in Naked Gun and he's funny no matter how bad a film is. He proves it with Repossessed, a tired comedy remake of The Exorcist. There were some very scary moments in this film and it started with Blair thinking she had comedic skills of any kind. She was a great child actor but the fuse sparked out a long time ago. This is okay to watch if you don't want to think or laugh that much but there are far more better horror comedies out there."" Transylvania 6-5000"" and "" Scary Movie I "" are hilarious. They maybe corny but they deliver the laughs. Repossessed was just a tired excuse for Linda Blair to reclaim her old character ONCE again."
4,Hilarious!,"I am a huge Leslie Nielson fan. I saw this movie years ago when it was first released. Mr. Nielson was in top form, and Ms. Blair was hilarious as well. I just had to admire her for making fun of herself and reprising her role from the original film. I don't think this movie would have worked without her."
2,repossessed ( the lost collection ),"o.k. i thought the movie was very funny, but if they are going to put movies on dvd from old video tapes, use a master copy, yes people it looks like it was copied from a video tape, picture not clear, sound not bad, if i wanted a crappy copy i would have put in the old video tape, because it looks the same but its on dvd"
1,Repossessed,"Repossessed is a satire movie starring Linda Blair and Leslie Nielsen. This has to be one of the worst movies that I have tried to watch in the last 5 years. The jokes are lame, the acting is on autopilot and the storyline is just downright horrible. The special effects look cheap and I first thought I was watching a movie from the early 80's. I wrote tried to watch since after 30 minutes I felt I had wasted time in my life that I would never get back. Definitely not recommended. 1/5."
3,"The movie itself is great, but what poor film quality!","I'd read the reviews of the quality of the print used for this DVD before I purchased it, and they were right. The film quality itself is quite poor. It looks like it was copied off an old VHS copy, not the clean good master copy. The movie itself is a good film, but the quality leaves much to be desired."
3,Eh........,"I'm a huge leslie nielsen fan so when I saw him in a movie and the movie was a comedy I do what any self respecting leslie fan does, buys the dvd. The movie is ok, there was some funny parts but not enough to keep it through the whole movie. Most of the acting is fine but a lot of jokes made you laugh simply because of how poor they were, the only thing that semi-saves this picture is Leslie who barely gives a great line. Waste of fine talent if you ask me. So all in all it has some laughs but just a tad dissapointing. Although I always like the chance to see leslie act even if it is in one movie such as this."
2,Not much fun,"I just got done watching this movie and what a disappointment. I think the problem is they makers could not decide whether this is a Nielsen or Blair movie. The movie ends up being about neither one. Neither very scary nor that funny.I got it because of Nielsen because I love his acting. I have got his stuff from Forbidden Planet all the way to Naked Gun series and more. I wanted funny! It has its funny moments but for most part it padded with ""filler"". The first third was slow; boring and not that funny. Then it got better as there was more of Nielsen. Then it goes down in the final third. Basically the good parts are a direct function of having Nielsen. The rest you might as well skip. It seems like they went cheap on the movie and instead of 100% Nielsen we get about 1/3. The padding is done by a whole lot of second rate music video. They should remove the fillers; and make it half as long then it will go up a few stars."
3,Not the best,"I love the satyrical movies that come out, so, I have pretty much all of Leslie Nielson's movies. This one had a couple of moments to it, but there are plenty on his list that are much better also. If you get this expecting anything more than a Leslie Nielson movie, you're going to be extremely disappointed. At best, it's a C+ to B- on Nielson's scale, not his best by far, but I've also seen worse."
5,This Movie is Great!!!,"Hi!! I'm only 16 years old, but I love this movie! I've been watching it all my life. Linda Blair really does a great job. But I don't understand why they gave her such an ugly name such as ""NANCY AGLET"". Anyways, this is the funniest movie i've ever saw, and I definately give this movie 5*****'s"
4,"Great spoof, but too many targets!","This has to be the best comedy I've ever seen. I own it on vhs. It is so funny that I cried through it! Nancy Aglet is a housewife who has been possessed by the devil. When a young priest comes to aid her she is put on a live tv show which will show the exorcisum live. It the mean time, Father Mayai comes to stop the devil, while Nancy gives out a great sense of humor. So many laughs but too many targets in the middle. Favorite Part: I liked the part where the bed is shaking and she figures that she presses the shaking button on her bed. Leslie Neilson is great. So is Linda Blair, but Anthony Starke is too shy in his role as a young priest."
4,Well designed little jacket,"I like this jacket a whole lot better than the first one I had. The bottom is totally open, so you don't have to take your iPod out of the jacket to use it in my home docking station. It also covers (and protects) the control wheel. The wrap for the ear buds is a bit funky, but works OK. The volume control on my Sennheiser earbuds is a bit too bulky for the cord wrap, but it works fine with the standard iPod white earbuds."
4,Very good,This is the right protector that I was looking to shield my ipod nano 2nd Generation from my baby hands and keep the head phones in a place easy to find
3,Ok case.,Bought this thinking it would be ez to use for headphone holding. However it is really difficult to get the buds to stay in and if you have foam on them it will get mangled in the sleeve/holding pocket. As for general holding and protection of the iPod itself works great.
1,Cracked Into Bits Like a Puzzle...NOT WORTH IT!,"I would have GLADLY paid more for something that lasted a little longer than 2 months before it started cracking from nub to nub like a puzzle... it is ""usable"" in that I still have plastic covering me low-pile Berber carpet, BUT it is becoming an up and down-hill roll around my desk area. I had chair mats from the big box office supply places that worked better and lasted longer than this. This needs to be pulled and re-worked to last longer. Disappointed to say the least!"
1,What a disappointment,"I perused a lot of chair mats, looking for one that would work with a carpet and didn't have a lip--which my desk cannot accept. This seemed like a good choice because no mention was made in the product description of a lip. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package!Well, I'll keep it because a chair mat is just a chair mat, and I will cut off the lip. It won't look great cosmetically, but almost no one will see it but me.Still, I am disappointed that Amazon didn't describe this chair mat completely, and I ended up making a purchase I am not happy with."
4,Excellent recording with minor flaws,"After listening to dozens of performances of Beethoven's 9th both live and recorded, I'd say this is close to the best.Pro: this is the best choral performance, hands down. The conductor's interpretation of tempo and enunciation of key passages is highly developed and well thought out. The recording quality is excellent. The fourth movement is breathtaking, even for someone who's heard it hundreds of times before.Con: the first three movements slightly lack cohesion, both internally and among each other.In general, this recording far exceeds the reference standard, but clearly centers on the choral performance. If you want the recording for the first three movements, you may find the Karajan sharper, although this recording is perfectly competent and highly listenable."
2,jn,"Not a real big fan of this album , and I am the biggest fan of Van Morrison, to much about just the intruments there are a couple of good songs though, so i will always have to listen to it."
4,Great Game Why did I Rate 4 not 5,"I realy do wish i could rate this game with 5 BIG stars, but i cant. Heres the thing. The edition to the Tony Hawk games (story mode) was AWESOME. It was more than awesome. The old ways of the game (classic mode) sucked. So I rate story mode 5 stars and classic mode 1 star. My reccomendation is to buy the game now that it is only $20 and only play story mode."
4,A good game,"unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game. and the story mode is a bit weak, however they make up in that with the classic mode. and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use, while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase. i reccomend you buy this rather than THUG1 or THAW. I garantee you will enjoy this game for a while."
3,For Kids or NOt?,"Ok, Ok, we get it. Tony hawk is fun and good. The problem is, it's the same game it was 10 years ago. Sure this time there are some destruction elements and some new players and new places, but blah blah blah. Same old, same old. This is a near perfect port of the ps2. It looks great, it plays great, and if you like completing tasks, you keep this game forever. Or, you'll figure out that you wasting insane amounts of time to complete stupid mundane tasks in order to unlock another fascinating new level and many more stupid tasks. We should call it Tony Hawk's puzzle skateboarding, since after the initial coolness of the new world wares off, you spend all of your time solving the puzzle of completing the task.Bottom Line: Is it fun? As fun as every other Tony game they release yearly. Will I keep it? Not for long. Nothing new here. Buy the game now if you love all Tony Hawk games. Is it for kids? Not to bad if your kids want to just skate around."
3,thugged out,thug 2 was dissapointing compared to the others. The new levels sucked because they all looked the same. They all were the same color. Personally I look forward to playing new levels maybe similar to real life places cuz you never get a chance to go there and skate. It was more like for a kid under the age of 14 to be playing this game. it's basically a kid's game this time. classic mode is the only thing that reddems this game. Soundtrack not near as good as thug 1 either. maybe next time they should put more realistic levels on there cuz that's the best thing to do is to play new levels not some lame ass kiddy stuff.
1,Wrong Platform!,"We could not play the game because what Amazon sold us labeled as ""CD ROM"" (i.e. for PC) actually came as a PS2 game. When we complained to GameFunk, they said that they don't sell any PC games and Amazon was at fault. The game has been returned to them. We want our money back!"
5,CRAZY,"This game is the overall BEST game ever made, i will admit the story mode starts kinda random but its not pointless. one time the camera messed up on me and all i had to do was BLOW IN THE FREAKIN CONTROLLER WHERE ARE PEOPLES BRAINS. Who cares if the story mode is another viva la bam episode ISNT THAT GOOD. Its also VERY hilarious, like when bam snaps a rubber band on a bulls butt so it charges into phils room. How can you go wrong with Bam. THe secret characters are soooooooo funny, like steveo from wild boys on the mechanical bull. ATTENTION: DONT LISTEN TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY, THEY ARE FROM THQ AND WANT TO SABOTAGE ACTIVISION"
1,Worst Game in The World,I wasted my week's allowance on this game and I have to say I'm never going to buy some retard skater game ever again. This game has brought to me the most boring day of my life ever. I spent hours on the first level just going round and round looking at the poor graphics of this game where every single rail and ramp was a square black and white figure. Tony Hawk looks like Mary Poppins and when you ride your board you seem to be flying above the street. I think a Super Nintendo game has better gameplay and graphics than this sad excuse for a PS2 game. Anyone who buys this game should think twice before doing it.
1,I cant even see where I am going!!,"Ok, Ive had this game for all of twenty minutes and Im about to go nuts. The camera angle seems to never want to go back to the original (read: thps camera). It pissed me off so much that I threw my control and broke it. O well, I guess its back to my coma and waiting for something bold and exciting to come around, because this wasnt worth it.P.S. If I am ranting and raving about a feature that you can change, let me know somehow..."
5,Best Game I've Got,Best game i've got and i've got a lot. Be a bunch of pro skaters (i like WEEMAN and Ryan Sheckler) or make your own skater. make cool parks and design your spray paint. Make your skater a girl or boy.Pros. Lots of action and it never gets boring.Cons. You can use one created skater at a time.Buy this game you won't regret it.Beat the game and get Shrek.
5,One of the best skate games ever!,I played this game at a friends house and i couldnt take my hands off the controller. great graphics awesome challenges and tight tricks. this is an awesome game if you want to goof around or go to the pros.
1,I am a fan of tony hawk,"I am a fan of tony hawk,but I hated this game and I don't say that word. it's fun for a minuite.after that forget it it was way to short.i'm sorry I wanted to like this game,i really did.why did bam & steve-o from that stupid movie make this game anyway. it was a stupid game,it was like the skating was just put in at the last second the graphics were bad T.H.U.G 1had way better graphicson the upside the music choice is good from johnny cash to metal.thats it.i bought this game without thinking bad ideaT.H.U.G 1 was way better in every wayas much as it hurts me to say this I gave this game a1 out of 5 only because 1 is the lowest numberI'm sorry this is a waist of money even if you bought for a pennygo buy T.H.U.G 1Forgive me TONY HAWK"
5,THUG REVIEW,i love this game i popped it i as soon as it came... by the way it came a day early. the disc looked better than brand new it looked untouch or played...thank you very much
2,The Biggest Pile of What Grows Roses,"In terms of ""round the bend,"" Icke is probably the prince. I enjoy and learn from a great number of ""conspiracy"" and other reality oddities writers, John Keel and Charles Fort being foremost among them, but, really! Icke claims to gain much of his information from some being he Channels, (not on TV) in a trance. All I can say, is if that is true, he's not only a purveyor of muck, but a victim of an all-time ""Let's pull a fast one on Charlie."" I suppose no one ever told Icke that the spirits have a weird sense of humour. Anyway, his work tends to get in some real information but it's so mixed with off the wall nonesense it becomes all but useless. I suppose one can say that Icke has his uses: can you say ""DISINFORMATION""?"
2,Clearly Mentally ILL,"I am all for conspiracy theories, and that is what brought me to this book...however...The author does have some interesting points and I found some of the book very captivating but he seems to go off into paranoid delusions, and exhibits classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. I do believe that Mr. Icke needs to seek some help in the form of therapy and medications. I believe that he is a talented writer and has potential, but that he will have a better outlook once he is treated."
5,"Excellent, well detailed information in David Icke latest.","Many who read this will have a difficult time swallowing much of the information this book has to offer because its conclusions dont paint a very pretty picture. However, the authors info. on the hidden agenda of the ruling elite, Princess Di's murder, the formation of christianity, corruption in our banking system, country musics associations with satanism or any other topics discussed are difficult to dismiss because of the well researched, detailed facts in ""The Biggest Secret"". Call Mr. Icke crazy if you will, but i'm willing to bet the truth was too much for you to handle. Its the best book of its kind since Bill Coopers ""Behold a Pale Horse"".A must read."
5,flash: david icke both sane and sincere!,"""the biggest secret"" will challenge your worldview like nothing else. if you come away enlightened, amused or indignant, it's all the same to david icke, i'd wager. having caught him twice on the ""biggest secret"" lecture tour, i can give you my impression of the man behind the uproar: he's a sane, sincere, spiritual individual (i.e., although on a crusade, he's not wrapped up in the banner of his own ego) out to deliver a message. what you do with it is up to you."
3,Help! The Reptilians are Coming!,"This should be read by those who are able to discern fact from fiction. If you are easily influenced then you should not read this book. He has gathered his evidences really well, nevertheless there still needs to be proof. I wouldn't be surprise if the author was a reptilian himself disguised as human in which he generally quoted through out his book."
2,The Biggest Nonsense: The Book That Reveals Nothing,"This book is a boring long-winded yarn about a vast non-existant ""conspiracy"" that continues to manifest in the present day. All manner of bizarre and garden-variety conspiracy fodder are thrown together in this vegetable soup of paranoia. The author doesn't attempt to make the slightest bit of sense with his writings and constantly spews mountains of bogus nonsense filled with sprinklets of questionable facts.The end result ?A book that attacks the rational senses of a thinking individual by hypnotising him/her with a non-existant version of reality.Mr Icke, you need serious mental help. If you think the world is run by seven foot slit-eyed shape-shifting fourth density reptillian beings that feast on people then please consider the possibility that you were dropped on your head at birth. This might also explain why you are truly beyond any hope of being normal."
3,"Too much info, too few subtitles","Oh David. He's got so much to say that he ends up presenting it in a manner which is slightly chaotic and often hard to digest. If only he'd offered titles for sub-categories, making the material easier to approach. For those who've got the patience to read every little digression and can still glean the main points, this is for you! But for those of us who need something a little easier to understand with a first read, this may try your patience. Nonetheless, I think David has information that more people should at least consider. Too bad his presentation is cluttered and rife with typos."
4,If Just a Portion of this is True....,"If just a portion of the allegations in this book are true, you might as well throw out every ""history"" book in your library. Although I liked the author's ""Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster,"" better, this book is impressive in scope and represents a mind-expanding experience. The author's basic premise is that a race of reptilian extraterrestrials has controlled the course of human events for thousands of years and continues to do so to this day. Many of the statements made in the book are objectively verifiable, but inductive leaps are made that are certainly a stretch. The chapter on the death of Princess Diana is probably the most interesting in the entire book and raises the prospect that she was ritually assassinated by The Brotherhood."
1,Comedy But Nothing Else,"Great comedy value for the first few chapters. Unfortunately this could not be maintained probably due to the fact that the author seems quite serious. Everyone who is anyone is a lizard or controlled by one. My favorite was Queen Elizabeth, E-lizard-birth (get it?). I actually couldn't finish it having gotten lost in the lizard geneology. The review from a Reader from Sacramento gives an excellant review of the book. Possibly the most poorly referenced book that I have ever read. Many references are attributed to the author's previous writings or to books published by the same publisher. At least one subject I attempted to persue was referenced to an ""unpublished paper"".Read the first few chapters in the bookstore over a cup of coffee for the comedy and save your money."
1,Off the Deep End,"The man is delusional. According to his theory my bloodlines would trace back to the reptilian race. I do not shape shift, sacrifice children, nor engage in perverse sexual rituals. I am a christian and my blood is the same as anyone elses. I have never taken any form of drugs and never intend to. The book is bits and pieces of the X-files, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and other movies pieced together. What I find the most objectionable is that all other sources of history according to Mr. Ickes is false except for the secret tablets and records that he is privy to. It is all hogwash!!!!! Don't waste your money."
3,The Biggest Secret,"A very powerful book from David Icke! While some of the contents seem a little far fetched, he reveals and documents information dating back thousands of years which links the then controllers of the world with those in power of our modern world. Anyone interested in conducting a little reseach, will have no difficulties in locating the same information them selves. David Icke ventures where many others dare not to tread. He reveals how the major religions were created and what their purposes is in detail. It is true to say that most religions have an agenda to keep their followers from finding the real spiritual truths, for once known by the people, their dominance through the indoctrination of hell and damnation of humanity will be over.This can help those interested in setting themselves free from the yoke of organised religion.Hans Liszikam, author of ""The God Code in the Seven"""
1,TOTAL RUBBISH!!!,"In the words of Ralph Kramden:""YOU ARE WAY OUT THERE!""This guy is a lunatic & this book is trash!It's sad that there are people out therethat like this book.The world is filled with alot of nuts!"
4,Captivating.,"I'm not sure what to believe. Paranoia or Perception.Really makes you wonder. I didn't agree with alot of what he writes (far-fetched), but it would explain some things. I'm surprised no one has sued him for libel and defamation, like the Queen. But I guess that would bring too much attention to it and unnecessarily expose it to the ignorant masses which don't have the opportunity higher education to question what they read and derive their own assessments. His theories are worth looking into. Although if they are true, we're in serious slavery of the third kind...."
1,What a disappointment! Embarassingly bad.,"It seems to me that D. Icke is trying to start a franchise. This book is downright bad. His research (unlike ""the truth shall set you free"") is minimal.He dedicates over two chapters to Babylon and Phoenicia, from which he then derives most of his later conclusions. However, both chapters are WRONG. In fact, ""purposely inaccurate"" is more like it. At times, he quite deliberately mixes and matches words and place names to confuse the reader and create false impressions to support unsupportable theories.I think that this book was simply written because the public expected one. I have personally lost all respect towards mr Icke."
1,Dare to Disagree,"I bought this book as the concept sounded interesting. I was hoping to find a well considered, structured explanation for these amazing theories. I am afraid to say that the book is very badly written and the few factual elements backing the wild speculation become lost in mindless babble.I would like to warn potential readers, who will only pick up the book if they consider themselves open-minded, that this self perception is abused horribly by the author. From the start, the author challenges the reader to accept his ideas or be condemned as closed minded - think about it.If any of these ""secrets"" do prove to be true, it will be a great pity that they could not have been delivered by a more coherent source."
4,good but hardly anything new,"The contents of this book that goes on to describe the most incredible things such as the illuminati, reptiles, satanic sacrifices and all the rest seems to strike some people as so incredible as to be fiction. However most of the book is nothing new and any researcher who digs deep enough will find such things and even stranger. Icke is to be commended because he is one of the few researchers who does what a researcher is supposed to do and that is to look at ALL the evidence and not just part of it to find truth. He presents the evidence and you decide the truth. I found his evidence compelling but there needs to be more to give it a probabilty of truth. Whoever said that truth is stranger than fiction surely knew how profound truth is. As fantastic as Ickes claims are they could be true and what a strange world if they are."
5,Everything is an illusion,"My whole line of thinking has been changed by this book. If you don't have an open mind, don't bother picking this book up."
3,Please Clean Up Your Act Icke,"The sad part about Ickes books are that there are many truths stated in them, but then there is also a lot of ""Here Say"" and such as well (Ex. Bush's sex slaves and such). Mr. Icke would you pleeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeee start putting out well written books with facts or at least well thought out theories for those of who would like to be able to take you seriously?It is rumored that the current Nicholas Cage movie character in National Treasure is based on Icke. There is no doubt the man is passionate about his beliefs. So when you read his work please look at it with an open mind and a bit of skepticism until he cleans up his act."
1,Ridiculous!,"I was loaned this book by a friend of mine at work. I tried to give it serious attention, as I do every book I read. However I could not get past some of the laughable ""facts"" Mr. Icke seemed to come up with, totally out of left field! Worse, he doesn't have any 'creditable' research references to back up his most insane claims. I gave the book back to my friend after only getting through the first 100pgs...its bad! Avoid at all cost, For your sanity's sake!"
1,Paranoid Brilliance,"Too bad David Icke has not grown out of seeing boogie men in dark closets. Other than his paranoia about repitilian space aliens controlling everything he is quite valid (metaphorically). He makes a nice subject for review though. He is a great example of what happen to all of us in the dark corners of our own repitilian consciousness. If you want to read a more precise and compelling view of what this is all about then read anything by Ken Wilber. Expecially Up from Eden where he anthopologically disects human consciousness and ""its"" tendancies to fantasize in themes that match our evolution. Much like David Icke is doing now and like our ancesters did when they wrote the metaphorical stories that have become fertile ground for Mr. Ickes imagination."
4,Very Entertertaining,"Shape shifting reptilians high in the ranks of politics like American presidents, the British royal family really running everything in the planet by manipulating people of the world through religion, media, the banking system, and big corporations run by the reptilan Annunuaki blood line since the beggining of human history is really hard to believe but very entertaining theory. Since David Icke seems to know who these shape shifters are he should snatch one and make it shape shift in front of a camera, thats the only to prove the Annunaki reptilain blood line theory. Do secret manipulating bodies really run the world, ""yea probably but reptilian, not likely"". Very entertaining book."
2,Science Fiction,Interesting concepts. Perhaps another version minus the lizards. This is about incredible (and believable as alien abduction and ufo's) It is an interesting idea but not necessarily one that I would subscribe to. Long!!
1,An entertaining farce!,"This book can only be classified as fiction and should be taken as such. Ickes should have used his time to create a novel of this material. If he would have, it probably be a bestseller. Most of the material is too fantastic to take serious, although at times it is quite interesting and funny. It is a large book that frankly is not worth the time to read, if you take it serious. However, if it was fiction, I would have given it three stars because taken as such, it is entertaining."
3,Kind of twisted,"Sure, there's a universal goal to create a new world order, and there's freemasonry and there's symbolic meaning in symbols,but referance to satanism is really far out plus,reptiles are born and they have to cut there tail off after birth? mental,picture of michaelangleos Human Male circle with a erect penis?(or two of them)The lower forth demision which is another referance to satanic cults! No such thing Sure miltary secret devices that the human eye can't see. Later part of the book human beings need love but so do the reptiles. He's either a satanic lord himself or metally ILL. One of his pictures of the wrecked car in Princess Dinas accident looks like a insect.(if it is acually a real photo of her car. Still very interesting reading. Did he write this book on his own or did a Santanic Cult help him? Only he knows.It's his biggest secret. Or we could all take LSD and finally see the reptiles. :>)"
3,the Biggest Secret- a critical review,"i have read the book and david's previous one titled, ""the truth will set you free"". Both are fairly good, but are expensive. the biggest secret revealed alot of hidden/secret information, yet was a bit steeped in the reptilian/ lizard analogy- which i found distasteful and not truely accurate. The book, ""the truth shall set you free"" was alot better in my opinion- i would recommend that one over ""the biggest secret"" Both are worth reading though."
3,Icke was duped,"Its sad that an honest researcher like Icke has been mislead by a false witness like Arizona Wilder. As someone pointed out,the ""reptilian thesis"" is founded in two ""witnesses"": credo mutwa and arizona wilder. Both are dubious, at least, and the latter may probably intentionaly mislead Dicke with the ""help"" of the British Inteligence.Dicke swalowed the ""bate"" and discredited himself and his theories.Still i think this book contains a lot of credible and dangerous information, that why i give it threee stars."
1,A book for the open-minded,"The author, Mr. Icke, brought his amusing and entertaining dog and pony show up here to the Great White North a couple of years ago.His audience was so open-minded that in many cases their brains had fallen out.File this one under RAVINGS."
5,One of the hottest books on Earth these days,David has finally decided to serve the full story as he sees fit. Not a book for the faint-hearted. But the story has to be told: if we do not know what really is behind the world theatre we cannot change it to the better. This book is all about getting people to wake up and start doing something instead of just groaning and feeling miserable.
1,Holy Cow! Gosh Golly Gee!,"Run under your bed and hide. Because you hardly Know anything about everything. Everything you Know is wrong. You're wrong and the Author of the book is right. Too bad. And everything around you is a humongous conspiricy.If it's your inclination to beleive all that, buy this irregularly written paranoid's theory."
1,BEWARE!!! SECT BOOK RIGHT HERE.,"All his books were based on the V series (book and TV show)from the year 1984. This book is a fraud wich can cost you your mental health. THIS IS NOT REAL!!! If you want better entertainment, just go watch the serie on abc web site or read the old book series... Don't waste your time on that piece of crap. Some lizards (especially Bearded Dragons) are the most sweet and cute creature on this world (It's my point of view, I love reptiles). An innocent creature like that CAN'T kill humans like almost 80% of the lizar species on earth...David Icke is a jealous sicko who trier to drag down everyone with him... He thought and always think he's the son of god, a messager. He's money/brain stealer. He's affiliated with anti-semist (Against Jew, because most of them have high position in world hierarchy) groups and doesn't worth a dam look to his books."
3,Holy Lizards batman!,"I have read most of Davids books, and it's always the same I agree with 70% of what he says and just cannot accept the other 30%. Anyway this is no different, some stuff i agree with, but the lizards c'mon man! especially about Queen Elizardbeth! haha, and little old queen mum, the reason why I reject this is because, I was reading a paper with photos of the royal family when they were kids, or baby lizards or whatever, anyway these photos of the queen , queen mum etc, they looked like normal kids,, so when did they become reptiles, when did they learn to shape shift?. On the whole I believe in the themes of the book, but I come away feeling it can't be true , Can it?"
4,interesting read,"You have to keep an open mind when you read this. I've always liked conspiracy books and history/secret societies, and Icke does a good job of making his point. It's entertaining and I just wanted to keep reading it, but like anything don't believe everything you read or are told. The shape shifting reptilian chapter was fascinating albeit strange, but like I said keep an open mind. There is a lot of interesting history that goes with it too. Secret bases where reptiles live in the fourth dimension, secret Satanic societies that infiltrate the highest levels of politics and government, the ritual deaths on sacred Babylonian holidays, the illusion of religion, the Nephalim, it's all in here. I enjoyed the read but like I said keep an open mind. Giant reptiles that control things from another world, sure just ask the royal family. Please don't believe everything you're told especially from the media or even Icke."
1,"David Icke's ""The Biggest Secret""","This book mixes facts with theories and then comes to conclusions that are, at best wrong, at worst misleading and evil. The author is more than welcome to his opinions, however, I do not recommend this book for a person seeking truth. Had he stuck to ""facts"" and refrained from inserting a conclusion for the reader, then this book would have offered a better read."
1,A Waste of Time,"I love conspiracy theories. David Icke's book is filled with many I've read about--the Masons, Illumanati,Unitarians etcs. But this one is a doozy. We're supposed to believe that there are people who change back and forth into reptiles? Come on, David. Aren't you pushing the envelope a bit too far? You need more than a few drawings to prove your point.This is very entertaining stuff, but only a certified paranoid would take it seriously. If half of what this book claims were true, theunseen masters who rule the world would have never let this book get published let alone put on Amazon."
3,Jorn Covers Some Awesome Stuff,I think Jorn is amazing. I have been following him since Ark. Jorn has delivered an awesome choice of cover tunes. His covers of Coverdale are his best stuff. I think he should do a Coverdale tribute album.
5,Perfect,"I love nothing more than the word ""SLUT"" emblazoned on my clothing, and this was just what I was looking for! The nylon is good quality, the ""SLUT"" a nice size, easily noticed, and they're actually rather warm. All in all, a great slut product! :D"
4,fast service but...,"So I clicked on the pic of the skulls hose and ordered them, but didn't realize that the slut hose and skulls hose had the same pic. So what I really received are a pair of hose that say slut on them. Fault is completely mine for not reading the print on the description closely enough. But be careful when ordering. On another note the deilvery was very fast and I will be ordering again. this time for the correct hose."
5,Unbelievable!,"This is a FANTASTIC album! I can't believe I haven't heard of her until now.This is the second funkiest stuff I've ever heard, second only to the Godfather of Soul himself. Heavy, heavy stuff."
4,"smart, roiling stories","Lots of layers in here, rumbling below. The weirdness makes it marvelous, and the language sings. It's definitely worth checking out."
1,Awful!,"I have to say, the author does have writing talent. The book was awful though. I would not reccomend it to anyone. They are weird stories about weird women and it was just awful. I hated it."
3,It's Good for the price,The graphics are cartoon. The story mode is for one player although there is a vs. mode. This game is so-so
3,"Fun game, but once its over, its over","This game is a great game and all. Definetaly the first and best robetech game ever, but it's replay value is very low. I dont know if it is just me, but i think that this game is over when its over. Tell me what you think of it peeps, later."
4,Best PS2 game -EVER!!,"This is one game that actually exceeds my expectations!I'm a huge Robotech fan, I've loved Robotech since it first aired on American TV back in '84 or '85. This game is long overdue for die hard Robotech fans. The game play can be a bit challenging at times, which for me keeps it interesting. There are also a wide variety of enemies and different veritechs you can unlock. The models are rendered perfectly and the scenery is fantastic. You can tell the programmers put a lot of time into doing this one right.Even if you aren't familar with Robotech, it's still a great game."
5,As Good As The Series,"If you enjoyed the series you will enjoy this game just as much. The attention to detail as well a strong story line makes it a hard game to put down. While the controls can be a challenge to master, the tutorials are a great help. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the graphics and fast paced action makes it an all around great game."
5,Perfect,"These are just what I needed for combining a whole year's worth of bills, receipts, records and whatever other papers"
2,Which is it?,"Are these fastened on the 11in or the 8.5in side of the paper?The pic of the box is red, like the ones that fasten on the 8.5in side; but the pic also appears to be long, like the ones that fasten on the 11in side, rather than short, like the ones that fasten on the 8.5in side.Pics of other sellers boxes of these that fasten on the 11in side are blue & are the same manufacture.Is the pic of this version in error, or the description in error, or are they indeed the fasteners that go on the 11in side?"
3,Not very useful,"It's best for testing patch cables, because you need to see both devices to really know what's happening. All it does is test continuity on each pin and generate a tone. It's a very simple tool, and won't tell you about split pairs. If you need this kind of device, I don't think it's worth buying. It's not very useful."
3,"Good Tester, But One Test Missing....","This unit will do basic continuity checks and generate tones on a CAT-5 cable, installed or standalone. The functionality and interface are both very good. However the supplied accessories include two useless BNC adapters and only one 5-inch CAT-5 cable. You need TWO short cables to check an installed CAT-5 run terminated with RJ-45 wall jacks.What it won't tell you, however, is whether or not any of the four twisted pairs have been incorrectly assigned, or split. This is important because a signal's path should always run across two wires that are twisted together. If a signal runs across two wires from two different twisted pairs, you lose the benefit of the twisting (interference rejection), especially with long cable runs.So, Amazon was very cooperative in permitting this unit's return, and I bought the Test-Um Lan Roamer Pro instead to get the missing feature. Unfortunately, this unit was triple the price of the TrendNet."
3,get what you pay for,"It works, but is on the low end for a cable tester. I am not certain how long it will last but am crossing my fingers."
5,Very helpful tool,"This tool quickly revealed the problem with the building's network wiring, and the fix was directed and quick. It's already paid for itself in saved time."
5,Solid Network cable tester,"Does what it is advertised to do, checked the cables pins and shows if the correspond with the other sides. I used it to crimp connectors going to a smart box then tested the connection on the other side"
5,Trendnet Cable Tester,"Great product to use in the installation of UTP cable. Used it to install structured media case for internet Cat6, telephone Cat3 and cable RJ59 around the whole house. Works with Cat6 & RJ11 modulars. Handy device to check pin continuity. Connect it to ends of jacks. Device will tell you if the 8 wires are connected correctly standard B or A. Since it is a basic device it will not tell you the length of the cable run. To keep cable to the correct length measure off or use another cable no longer than 100 feet. Uses 9 volt battery not included."
4,Worked as promised,"Arrived rather slowly, taking several days to traverse 150 miles. Worked just fine. Remember to check both ends each time. That's how you detect improper pairings."
1,purchased for work,i purchased this item for work and the leds started going out after a few days . i don't recommend it spend a little more money and get something that will last
1,Didn't work for me,"I read and studied this book thoroughly. Then I got a racing form, and picked a race. I telephoned the owners of the horses and only 1 of them would actually discuss their horse with me. I told them their horse told me that he would run faster if he got to breed a mare the night before the race. The owner hung up on me, so I bet against that horse. However, the horse won the race. I could have come out $1000 richer. I think the owner must have taken the advice I gave them. Wanna bet?Recommended reading: james randi dot org"
1,Not what I thought it was.........,The book tells you how to communicate with animals using an animal communicator which is OK. I thought it was about teaching you to communicate with animals. I was disappointed.
5,Great film and Music,Lovely film with a a great performance from Fulton McKay as Mac. and splendid scenery. Enjoyed every minute can watch it over and over again and a terrific musical score from Mark Knopfler.
3,"Good Stuff, but not the best","This CD has it's ups and downs. There are some brilliant tracks on here, most notably the main theme, the last track. But the theme can also be heard playing throughout some of the other tracks, here and there.Some of the tracks are rather useless, for pure listening purposes that is. I'm sure in the movie they served some use, and they wanted to include the music so as not to jyp the customer, but I would just as soon skip the tracks.So, as stated earlier, there is some good stuff on this CD, but it's not all wonderful. Of course, if you are a die hard fan of Knopfler or the movie, then you won't be dissapointed. Otherwise, this is good, but there is better stuff out there."
3,only good if you like the film,"I have always loved this movie. The theme...would you give up your materialistic and safe world for passion, simplicity, honesty, etc? Have we created a perfect world that once we leave it and view from it the outside, may not be that perfect? Would you leave it all behind to live on a coastal Scottish town? Is killing yourself for the imposed luxuries really worth it?Knopfler's theme to the movie re-creates the utopian vibe of the movie. The theme is done in a variety of styles and tempos.I would imagine that anyone that owns this is in a somewhat cult of enthusiasts for this beautiful yet quirky film."
2,Lots of repetition,"First, the recording volume is so low that I have to turn my stereo volume to maximum to hear all the intricacies of the majority of the tracks. Right out of the box, my DVD-ROM wouldn't read the last track, although it seems to work fine in regular CD players.You'll notice, looking at the track list, that a few of the songs have identical names. The reason is, they are basically the same tracks with slight differences. There are three distinct parts to this CD: the soundtrack composition, the Scottish band, and the Rafferty song. The song is pretty good, the band is annoying after a few listens, and the rest of the CD is too quiet to hear.This isn't particularly inspiring music; not Knopfler's best work."
5,"ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, BRINGS THE FEELING OF SCOTLAND TO YOU!","I am 16 and I bought the Local Hero album before I saw the film and I absolutely love it. It really makes you feel like you are in Scotland, and as you lie back and close your eyes this music brings it all to you!. I have tried to collect all things Mark Knopfler has done (inc. Dire Straits) mainly because I think he is one of the best guitarists in the world. If anyone would like to E-mail me and talk more and share info about his music then please e-mail me: daniel_walton@lineone.net I would love to hear from anyone who shares similar view..."
4,"Rocks, Water, All That Matters","This is my favorite movie ever, so I'm biased. What the soundtrack brings to the table is dreamy, sensual, and romantic. Knopfler communicates much better through his guitar playing than singing (he does none here), and ""Smooching"", ""Going Home"", and ""Wild Theme"" are brimful of wistfulness, borrowing more from classical than folk. I listened to this album every night for the summer of 1983!"
1,bottarga di muggine,"The quality of this product is very bad - it is very very dry and it looks like it is too old already. I understand that it is genuine and original and really comes from Sardegna, however the Bottarga product, that I usually buy there is much better tasting and a way better looking."
4,Goos Testimony,"I just can simply say that this recording is the only testimony we can afford if we have to study on Penderecki's work (for the CD recording is not avaible any more or at a outrageous price...)It is weird and gloomy, however there is no reason to steer clear of it =)Perhaps the staging is not always true towards History. Anyway, what Penderecki and his libretists made of that historical episode is remarquable (in the meaning it must be watched and discovered)The performance in itself is quite catching, the lipping technique is not always obvious. So every feeling is well given on screen.Staging is also well built enough to make this work terrifying, oppressive, frightening and horrible (the scenes ""buffa"" with the two scientists where pseudo-science is melt with religion making something even more striking than it could be).Please don't feel reluctant towards this opera for those reasons. Considered as a whole, it is worth discovering =)"
5,The Best EVER,"If your into spy things, and awesome looking or high educated florists, then you will love this dvd,4 boys, each have a mysterious past, left their loved ones behind to join a secret agency to hunt down beasts and elimnate them from seeing their tomorrow ""knight hunters, deniy these beasts their tomorrow"" before they go on a mission that is the last thing they hear!!you must get this if you are into spy things, ""there contains some violent scenes""but other than that, AWESOME series!!"
3,....,"Overall, I think this was really great! I love the manga and I've been waiting for this for a long time.... I really DON'T like the voices. They [stink]. But anyway, the main reason I only gave this 3 stars is: WHERE IS NAGI?!?!..."
4,White Hunters hunt the Futures of the Dark Beasts,"Or something like that, I forget the correct quote. *looks sheepish* The brainchild of the band Weiss (aka the main voice actors for the series) Weiss Kreuz is full of eye candy, and one of the more surprising plotlines I have seen. Usually, one can guess the nature of a series from the get go, but there's a few loops thrown into this one! About four bishounen (pretty boys) turned assassins with equally tragic pasts fighting against unjustice that is untracible by normal Japanese law. It is worth a glance (or more)."
5,A must for your collection,"Unlike some people(or is it one) I dont think this exploits anyone. I found it a refreshing change compared to a lot of the nicey-nicey anime out there. The heros are assasins and they know it, they do not try to cover it up. The assasins are in the service of good but have their own probs. Be forewarned, The first 2 episodes are ssslloooww and hard to get thru but it is worth it. The series picks up with the 3rd episode so slogging thru the intro stuff is ok. Pick it up you will like it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I am a horror movie fan and have watched alot. The acting is poor, the story is more of a comedy than horror. Looks like something that Shock Theater would not show."
3,Better than Jessica Rabid,I just got this movie and Jessica Rabid from troma. I have to say this was the better film. The direction in this movie is outstanding it makes the direction of Jessica rabid look like that movie was made by a group of autistic children. Survival surpasses Jessica Rabid in every way. You might ask why did you give this film only three stars. Well even though it is better than jessica rabid that is no achievement. Any Person with arms could grab a camera and make a better movie than Jessica Rabid. Oh and also Survival has a lot better looking girls than Jessica Rabid. The girl on survival does not stick to the floor when she does the splits. We could actually smell Ukeleske Mcains vagina that's how gross Jessica rabid is. You won't be scared you will throw up. So if you have a choice between this and that rip off of lucky mkee's the women. I would go with survival.
2,Outdated,"This release has recently been shown to be incorrect as a result of the recent calls for democracy by the citizens of Egypt, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, and developments in Israel and Iraq. If the current administration's policies are doomed to failure as stated in this book, why then do the policies appear to be getting results in the Middle East? Clearly Solderberg has it wrong. And she worked in previous administrations? Wow.I gave Soderberg an extra star for the personal stories she had in the book, although I question how appropriate their inclusion was in a book of this type. I was more interested in her theories than in her stories.It was amusing reading through this book and then later observing how wrong it was based on current events. This is a good example of how wrong the ""intellectuals"" can be regarding world affairs."
2,Another Dingbat Trying to Make a Buck,"The author's selective amnesia about how terrorism, especially Al-Quida, flourished long before George Bush ever became president is not astounding, it is expected from the goofy left. Bush bad, Clinton (her ex-boss) good. When is this baseless, childish tripe going to stop finding a publisher??"
5,"What's wrong with D. Velagaleti ""DV""?",I don't know what the person were talking about? It seems he gotproblems with Amazon.
2,Pet Nail Scissors,"For a VERY small dog, these would be fine. For anything over 5#, they need to be longer so you have more leverage."
5,"Loved the album for decades, great reissue","I own this on Vinyl, MP3 and CD. Nothing beats the old groovy disks, but this mp3 album comes close. Most reissues of this record are dubs from an LP (clean dubs to be sure), or horribly overpriced imports, but these mp3 tracks are clearly sourced directly from the old Capitol master tapes. You can tell by critical listening with headphones; those old tape machines had a few quirks in them. Not only is this a beautiful record, but it is a great presentation of it. The only thing missing is the album art and the old Capitol rainbow spinning on the turntable."
5,Don't We All?,"Of course we all want The Star Carol, but it is not a review of the CD to say you want it."
4,Not for Idiot's Only!,I purchased this book to try revitalize my cold calling strategy. It was informative and gave me a couple of new view points to see where I might be able to tweak my cold calling and prospecting skills.I would recommend this book to novice & experienced sales people who have to make prospecting calls on a daily basis.
4,One of the BEST sales systems book ever.,"I've read many books on sales and selling by some of the best people in the industry. This is probably one of the best books I've read though, in that it actually helps you step-by-step build a solid prospecting and sales system. Having a proper and reliable system is really the only way to succeed to the level I desire."
4,Idiot's Guide to Cold Calling Review,"This is a good book for those who are just beginning their cold calling career. It provides good techniques as well as outlooks on the reasons for cold calling. I would recommend for any novice cold-caller just getting started. However, for those who loathe cold calling, but realize the necessity of it in their business, I would HIGHLY recommend Wendy Weiss's Cold Calling for Women."
5,"Not Just About Cold Calling But New Prospecting Ideas, Too!","Who hasn't at some point in his or her career sat staring at the phone, paralyzed at the prospect of picking up the receiver and making that dreaded call? For most of us, cold calling is the weakest link in our chain of selling effectiveness. This book puts it all together, step-by-step, and shows you how to turn this greatest of challenges into your own personal secret weapon. Plus other outstanding prospecting ideas that will help bring in even more business. There is very, very good stuff here, on every page. This book should be required reading for every business person everywhere."
2,It's not even silent!,"I don't think I have the ears of a dog but I sure can hear the piercing sound of this ""silent"" whistle. I'd return it but the shipping would eat up most of the cost."
2,"CHEAP QUALITY, DOES AN AVERAGE JOB","IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME THING CHEAP TO USE AROUND THE HOUSE, THIS IS ENOUGH. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PROFESSIONAL/COMPETITION LEVEL, THEN GET UK MADE, THEY HAVE PROVEN PRODUCT ON THE FIELD TRIAL~!!!!!"
1,Does not work!!!!!!,Apparently either is not for i-phone 3gs or my phone has stretched??? Its on a drawer somewhere but has not been used. I feel like I bought something cheap so it's worthless too.
4,Good mower! A lttle on the expensive side,"I have had my mower for one month, and have used it 3 times. The Sens-a-speed propulsion system works great and is very easy to use. It however causes a drag when you have to reverse, so it makes mowing more of a chore if you have a lawn that requires you to stop and back up. My lot is a bluff lot, so backing up, uphill, is even more of a chore. This is my first self propelled mower, so I do not know if they are all this way. It mulches very well and cuts evenly. The bagging system is superb. It is very easy to switch between bagging and mulching, and removing or replacing the bag is too easy. All in all, I would give this mower a 9 out of ten, with the drag going backward and steep price tag the only negatives."
2,"sensa-speed fragile, delivered broken","Mover arrived broken. The sensa-speed had been pulled out of its track and a little plastic part was broken. I bet the mower will run awesome once it's fixed but in the meantime I'm left with a new mower and having to jumb through hoops. Called Lawnboy and they said they wouldn't have shipped it that way so it may not be a warantee item. Not impressed with buying lawnboy mowers, didn't seem like they stand behind product unconditionally. Lawnboy cust service recomended we contact Amazon about returning or UPS to file a claim and blame them."
2,Quality Control,This unit shipped without a hole drilled in the handle for attaching the brake. The gas cap was also missing the vent. This caused hours of frustration as the mower would mow for 5 minutes and stop. Now that the mower is working it is a nice mower. But the lesson here is never purchase something online you cannot return.
2,Arrived Damaged,"My new Lawn Boy arrived from FedEx today. When I saw how the box was all beat up and torn, I was worried. Sure enough, the plastic clamp at the end of the cable that drives the rear wheels was broke. I found a place that services mowers. I'll bring it in for service tomorrow and and will provide an update later. Some of the parts look flimsly so I'm a bit worried how this machine will hold up over time. Also, I don't have much respect for FedEx as it appears that they don't have much respect your stuff."
5,Just Right... So Far,"Only had a chance to use this Lawn-Boy #10685 a few times, but I am very impressed: Light in weight, powerful (cut 4"" grass easily), compact (folds up nicely, small deck & bag). Maneuvers quite well; the Sens-A-Speed is great, no need to learn or adjust anything, just push! Came assembled out-of-the box, just add oil & gas. With rear-wheel drive, it was able to go up steep inclines with little or no effort. Did not use the bagger yet (I hope I never do!), but if I have a problem with it, I will modify my review. The few minor irritations are the clunky pull rope/handle and the confusing height adjustments/indicators. Otherwise, I am very happy. My previously owned self-propelled mower was a clunker compared to this (it lasted 7 years until the transmission pulley broke-off). I hope this one lasts as long or longer. Also Kudos to Amazon.com: I bought the mower with free shipping that took two days!"
4,Beware inadequate assembly instructions,"I don't consider myself a dummy when it comes to assembling products, but this one just about got the best of me. The rather complex sensaspeed control is unassembled and just hanging off the handle with no instructions or helpful illustrations. However, after I finally got it figured out and put together it operates beautifully. The self propelling wheels actually move the mower forward instead of just spinning on the grass as had been my experience with other so-called self propelled mowers. The sensaspeed seems almost magical. It does seem to be somewhat underpowered, but that may be the result of the self propelling being so effective. I would definitely recommend this mower to anyone who is a mechanical engineer or who has access to one."
3,Doesn't keep pace!,"Great shipping-3days. Sens-a-speed function does not perform well(have to exert too much effort to make mower move,by the time I finished mowing the lawn I felt I was using a push mower). My husband made the cable adjustment as per owners manual, didn't make much of an improvement till he had finally taken all the slack out of the cable-should be 1/8"" of slack. Still seams you have to push too hard for a self propelled mower. Next alternative,take a new lawn mower in for service. Not what I expected."
3,Second one is five stars,"First one shipped had the handle all come apart in shipping. Amazon's first response was pretty much - between you and the manufacturer - read the fine print dude - we don't allow lawn mowers to be returned. Guess what, local Lawn Boy dealers don't really want to work on Amazon shipped product. After I sent a nasty note back to Amazon that I would never buy from them again, they decided shipping a replacement was the right thing to do. Seoncd one came perfect, set up easily, and started on the first crank. The Sens-a-Speed is a very clever invention and does not take any time to get use to. It was taking be about two hours to mow my yard with my old Honda (still runs, just the self-propelled part had quit working), now it takes just over an hour. Awesome"
2,Beware if you buy from deerso,I Purchased a lawnboy from Deerso through amazon online as a birthday gift for a friends mother who had a broken lawnmower. I told the mother and friend it would arrive in a few days as that's what the website said when I checked out. Two weeks went by. It never showed up. Deerso never sent the item and amazon help said that deerso canceled the order and did not notifiy anyone. No phone call. No email. Nothing. They did not tell me or the person it was going to who now has two foot grass and is angry with me. Amazon thought deerso was probably out of stock as they quit selling the particular model I ordered that week. Because of the way the order was canceled it's not possible to give deerso direct feedback as a seller- but beware.
5,Lovin' the Lawn Boy!,We're very happy so far with our mower. It even makes the fiance WANT to go out to mow the lawn!
5,Best Lawn Mower I've Ever Had,"I've mowed my lawn several times now, and just love the way the machine runs. It's fast and easy. It's very easy to start, having only to pull once to get it to turn over. I haven't used the bag yet, because I'm using the mulch system, but the opening in the fabric mesh bag is large and doesn't look like it would take much effort to empty. Very easy to change from mulch to bagging. I would highly recommend."
2,Not recommended unless you have mechanical ability,"Bought this and upon 1st use the clip on the handle which holds the cables kept popping off, had to secure it with a worm drive clamp. On its 2nd use the drive stopped functioning, had to reset the cable and torque the retainer, which is plastic, hopefully this won't be a continuous problem. I can not in good conscious recommend this mower to someone unless you have mechanical ability to keep repairing this mower."
1,Be Careful no muffler guard and not for hills,"Got 2nd degree burns adjusting the wheels, there is no muffler guard on the side of the muffler to protect against burns.I am small and it is difficult to use on hills and rough sod. My old large wheel handled backyard much better and was easier to use on hills."
2,2 years of life,"The title is self-explanatory. Bought it, loved it, then after two years this March, it died. Spark plug, oil, and air filter seem fine. Right now, deciding whether to take it somewhere, or buy a new one. Seems like it should've lasted longer for the price..."
4,Great Mower...,"This Mower is a fine piece of machinery. Light-weight and easy to control with the sens-a-speed feature. Very powerful. My neighbors love it too! There are two minor drawbacks. The plastic clips that fit over the metal tines to adjust the height of the rear wheels were put on backwards at the factory and broke during the first attempt to make adjustments. A new set were put on correctly and work fine. If there is a detractor to the system, its the grass catcher... it is a bit small and requires more empties than my old machine; but I am willing to put up with an extra couple of trips to the dumpster for the ease and power of this machine! Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
4,"Minor initial issues, but looks like a winner","Arrived with part of the Sens-a-Speed mechanism (widget on the handle) in pieces, I called Lawn-boy customer service who directed me to a web page that contained enough information to reassemble the mechanism. After I explained the problem to the customer service rep she asked if I bought the mower from Amazon and commented that it would be a good idea if instructions were included. In retrospect I should have asked if this is a common problem.Priming. It took a lot more than the recommended 3 pushes of primer to start the engine for the first time. Subsequent starts were easy.Light (compared to my old Toro), easy to maneuver, looks like a winner."
5,NMB Never Fails to Create a New Sound!,"Alright... I already wrote a review... but since it hasn't been registered, I will write another (it will be much shorter).Alright, I think that this is their best album. Now, even though it took me a little while to get used to it, after I listened to it a few times, I soon found myself turning to ""This Is Satire"" instead of ""File Under Black"" and ""Loud about Loathing"".None More Black's sound has evolved quite a bit. It is not as raw... or hardcore punk sounding, but I think that it is better this way. We all got Kid Dynamite and we will always love it. But this is a new band. None More Black now has created their own unique sound that no one else can duplicate. While still keeping some of that raw sound that we love, they are able to put more melody into their music, while still keeping their amazing lyrics and song titles. Keep it up NMB!!"
2,"Seriously imbalanced, dishonestly biased.","Serbians did commit genocide and other horrible atrocities in Bosnia, and Serbian Orthodox clergy and laity played parts in these both implicitly and explicitly. The sanctification and legend of Prince Lazar played a part in the justifications and mentality of the Serbs as well. However, Sells systematically ignores the Serbian church's frequent and often dangerous resistance to the wars and genocide. He has a remarkable ignorance of the history of the Balkans before Tito. Finally he overestimates the significance of the Lazar myth in the Serb's actions: not all nationalistic myths produce large-scale genocide!Sells barely veils his hostility toward religion (not only Serbian Orthodoxy), and although the events are tragic and terrifying, I hope we value clear thought and honesty more than Michael Sells. He feels passionately, but his book is merely another inflammatory tirade, nearly as mythological and certainly as simplified as the Serbs' Lazar myth."
5,Trenchant insight into the Bosnian crisis,"Unlike other accounts of the recent wars in the Balkans, Michael Sells' book does not merely chronicle the events that led to the catastrophe. The value of this fine work lies in the author's ability to present the underlying ideas, cultural constructs and religious passions that have flamed the genocide in Bosnia. The author focuses mostly on the Serb-Orthodox construct of Christoslavism, but also shows how the Western prejudices against the region have allowed genocide to occur in Europe at the end of the twentieth century. Resting on well-documented research (over fifty pages of footnotes plus appendices), it is an erudite and passionate argument for kindness and humanity towards those less fortunate than us."
5,Religion as a Catalyst for War,"Michael Sells has written an important book that ranges the history of Bosnia from the days of the Ottoman invasion leading to the war that tore apart the Balkans. Few people have read Sells' book, but it is intensely readable and is instrumental in anyone's comprehension of what really caused the carnage of the Balkan War. He acknowledges the complexity of the region, and does not pretend to portray a comprehensive view of the war from a purely objective stance. Those who pretend to be objective, he says, are naive at best. He therefore limits his explanation of the war through the lens of religion, and the role it played as a catalyst to the outbreak of hostilities. If you cannot spend time in Bosnia, talking to the people there, seeing the mass graves that litter the countryside-- reading this book is a good beginning in developing a basic understanding of what occured there and why."
4,A must-read,"This is a unique look behind the conflict in Yugoslavia and the mythology created by Serb nationalists that fomented incredible crimes against humanity. He looks at the religious and cultural mythology created and revived by a warped interpretation of Balkan history that many nationalists used. I only wish this book was longer, it is a great read."
1,DUPLICATE PRODUCT,THEY SELLING DUPLICATE PRODUCT. NOW THEY DON'T WANT TO REFUND MY MONEY EVEN THOUGH I RETURN THE PRODUCT. THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE FROM AMAZON AND IT IS WORST EXPERIENCE.
1,Extremely disappointed,"Paid for 15 bags of popcorn; however, only received 8 useable bags because seven bags were burst opened by a piece of metal thrown in on top of the box in a box and all the popcorn spilled out in the box. Stale and yuh!!!"
2,Not so good.,Would not buy again. Good quality but metal swivel slams against camera and make much noise. While at all times seeking to be as non-existent as possible while shooting something - from wildlife to a youth sporting event - the noise is awfully distracting. Great quality - poor decision to use metal parts.
1,Hmm...,"Mr. Lowenthals description of his Dark Retreat didn't seem to have a lot in common with the 'real' Tibetan 49-day Dark retreat and its practices. I know at least 4 people who have done the 49-day dark retreat of which one is very close to me and as much a Westerner as Mr. Lowenthal. It is 'unthinkable' to leave the dark room, even if it is with a mask on, as well as having sex, food brought into the room by a person or even talk to several people while doing this practice. I must say... It is good he wrote ""A Western Approach"" as this certainly is NOT the Tibetan approach :-)"
1,Where was the music?,"Sadly, this DVD lacks the required musical underpinning to keep it afloat. I wonder how anyone made the required voyages in the opera with such poor sound from the pit - and hence a general lack of bouyancy and direction."
5,Surely nothing else compares to this performance,Nothing is ever perfect but this performance is probably as close as one will ever find to perfection in an opera house. The sum total of all those participating is so overwhelming that one easily forgets any minor quibbles. I won't repeat what others have said but just the prelude alone tells you this is going to be something very special from Barenboim. Surely Waltraud Meier inhabits this role in a way few others have done since it's premiere. The Milanese audience more accoustomed to Italian fare gave it thunderous approval. No one interested in opera should be without this -- Wagner lover or not!
1,The pot calls the kettle black,"So:Jules Verne, one of the founding fathers of Science Fiction, is revealed to be a bad writer who relies on a severely bastardized Captain Nemo to supply him with ideas. This is just beautiful! I find it fitting that this premise is conceived of by Kevin J. Anderson, a writer who has relied on other writer's ideas for his career (Star Wars, Dune, X-Files, etc.).Please, if you have any respect for Jules Verne or classic literature in general, do NOT bother with this book. Nemo, as envisioned by Anderson, bears almost no resemblance to the character depicted in 20,000 LUTS and Mysterious Island. I checked it out of the library, so at least I didn't have to pay; however, that's 4 nights of reading time that I can never reclaim."
3,Not bad,This book is nice and imaginative. I imagine I would appreciate it more if I was more familiar with Jules Verne.
4,Captain Nemo,"I am about half way through the book and it does a good job of seaming how Captain Nemo became the man that he did and the connection with his supposed friend Jules Verne is a very interesting premise. I do see how Kevin Anderson is using the Verne books to write the storyline and waiting to see how it all ends though foreshadowing has not been apparent. So far a decent read but I am waiting to get into the how and where the Nautilus is built and Nemo's reason for using it, though it is hinted at in the book with his bad experience with pirates as a cabin boy on an exploration ship."
1,It came from the bottom of the sea....,"I'm not going to mince words, this book is horrible...It's a pastiche of Verne's life, intercut with the adventures of ""Andre Nemo"" who wanders around the world, involving himself with incident after incident drawn from the pages of Verne's novels, and minor character, after minor character named after Verne's charactersMy biggest gripe however is the vision of Nemo presented, this is not the mysterious stranger of the 20,000 leagues under the sea, or the technocratic Indian Prince, driven from his home after a failed rebellion against colonial masters as presented in Mysterious Island. Having all the works of Verne to draw from, and KJ Anderson, instead chose to draw his Nemo from the wide screen, he has drawn his ""Dark Genius"" from the vision of Walt Disney, and Harper GoffThe result is what you expect, a poor adaptation of an adaptation, true neither to the original, or the film."
4,Good Fun,Looking for a book you and your young teens will enjoy. Give this one a try. Reads very much like a 1950/1960 Science Fiction movie.Lots of adventure and no sex.
2,Off an AM Radio??? Or maybe just a bad bootleg.,"These are some of Willie Nelson's greatest hits. Unfortunately the quality of the recording sounds like someone took a cassette tape recorder and recorded the songs off an AM radio. You can barely hear Willie on some songs, his voice fades in and out, and one one song it seems someone must of started the tape recorder late and cut off the first few seconds of the song. His voice is still pretty good so it seems these recordings are from the 80's. It's a shame that before someone made this CD in their mother's basement, they spent some money cleaning up the tapes. Someone thought the sound was so bad that it must not be stereo. SO UNLESS YOU ARE DIE HARD WILLIE NELSON FAN WHO MUST HAVE EVERY ALBUM EVER MADE, I WOULD PICK A BETTER QUALITY ALBUM."
3,Library book,What I ended up getting was a copy of a library book. Pretty worn. But it makes enjoyable lunchtime reading here at the Krill Instritute.
3,"Works fine, but problem with image","this device does what it claims, but i'm getting some kind of shadow in my LCD monitor. when i connect the monitor directly to a PC the shadow goes away, but when i use the switch it appears again. that's frustrating when you are very demanding about the image quality."
4,What a great find!,"Positive: This product does everything it says it will do. It was very easy to set up and begin working with. The price was also great.Negative: The Logitech Trackman driver supports full button customizations, but the KVM does not seem to permit driver to mouse communication, so the Logitech Trackman responds as a generic device."
3,Is ok..,"Is working fine but the picture do not match with the one I got it, but is ok is working, I will recommended. Mine looks old, the one in the picture is the new one I guess !!!!!."
5,Perfect,My truck got hit in a drive by crash taking out my lights and mirrors. This was a perfect replacement.
2,Pretty but Petite,These glasses are nice to look at but are too small to hold an adequate amount of martini.
2,Disappointing performance,"These clippers are just not that sharp, which is pretty important for ""headliner"". If I could combine these with the Wahl edgers I have, which are too sharp, they would be perfect."
