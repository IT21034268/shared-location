3,Warning: This is not a story!,"This book is for die hard fans of the belgariad and the mallorian only. It is more like an encylopedia than a book, it is a very detailed history of Garion's world, but it is a bit boring at times"
2,unasked for and unneeded,"The Belgariad is considered an epic by most, and the Mallorean is a welcome continuation. ""Belgarath"" and ""Polgara"" were reasonably interesting, but not this one. The Rivan Codex is contains such trivialities that the authors had forgotten to include in the books, along with tidbits that no one really wanted to know. It seems as though the authors are milking the cash cow that is this series as far as it can go. Read the first ten books of the series, and the two following if you wish, but this book is by no means a necessary addition to your library."
4,"Fascinating, but for real Edding's fans only.","This book is feally fascintating. I really think that, if you want to read this book, you should read the Belgariad and Mallorean series at least twice before, and read Polgara the Sorceress and Belgarath the Sorcerer. If you haven't read these books beforehand, none of that book makes sense. It's a shame the David Eddings isn't going to write anymore of this series, but give him a break! He's almost 80 years old (wow)."
4,Eddings fans will love it,"I am amazed at the criticism this book has received. It appears to me that most readers really have no concept of the effort required to produce the multi-volume epics Eddings has written. The introduction may border on arrogance, but the fact that he's right ought to come into consideration. This type of book is rarely published. Its a compilation of notes and studies that form the underlying structure of The Belgariad -- it is not a story in and of itself. True fans of Eddings will love it. Others will not."
1,BEWARE / Not Good,This CD is NOT the Pages that are the same members who went on to later become Mr. Mister. I'm so glad I only paid about seventy-five cents for this stinker.
5,neglected retertory in strong performances,"Along with the symphonies of Dukas, Chausson, d'Indy, and Roussel, these are key works, tracing an arc from romanticism to a sort of neoclassicism. The performances are brilliant and committed."
3,"Nice, but a bit overhyped","I generally love all things Prada, as well as many woody oriental fragrances, so I was expecting something more original from this designer. This scent is very reminiscent of Angel, Dali, and others like Talisman. To my nose it's not ambery, as described; the top note is more fruity (mango?) and sharply herbal; but it dries down nicely to warm middle and base notes. And thankfully it's not peppery or reeking of vanilla, like so many other modern orientals."
1,DESTRUCTIVE,"My fiance' left this bottle of Prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it, IT WAS EMPTY !!! Seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer (pump sprayer) and then it ALL LEAKED OUT and down the bottle ""glueing"" itself to the jewelry box. Now we have an EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRADA and A RUINED FINISH on the top of the jewelry box. I have sent Sephora an email explaining what had happened, but have not heard back from them. Beware of where you keep this bottle !!!!"
5,Complex & Mysterious = Seductive,"A very sensual scent. Non-floral, not cloying, warm and sweet and spicy without being overpowering. Amber and sandalwood...like wearing incense from another land."
5,The Perfect Perfume for the Migraine Sufferer,"I am very picky about perfumes because most of the stronger-scented ones will induce my migraines. My wonderful husband purchased this perfume for me last Christmas, after I sampled it in a magazine. I love the bottle the perfume comes in, and it comes equipped with a ""foo-foo"" atomizer. The smell is nice and warm, and it reminds me of a winter day spent in front of the fireplace. I always get compliments when wearing the Prada scent.The downside is that it is expensive- $95 a bottle for the larger size. But I only use it about once a week."
1,not my cup of tea,This smells really old and musty. I guess its all the matter of taste since I saw so many good reviews.
1,took a chance,I enjoy most things Irish and a good 'troubles' movie.Skip this one and save your money-just couldn't buy the plot/acting.
2,My Brother's War,"This movie had a good plot. The performances by Salvator Xuereb and Patrick Foy were absolutely superb as feuding IRA brothers. I could have done without James Brolin. He and his character were out of place and his acting, as usual, leaves you unmoved. It's a movie worth watching on a rainy day. It is especially worth watching for the poem at the end - very moving."
4,video moved quickly and was easy to follow,plot was very cleverly layed out and characters seemed to have depth. not too bloody even though the subject matter is very riviting.
2,My Brother's War,"This movie has an interesting, if slightly used up, story line. The highlight is the performances by Salvator Xuereb and Patrick Foy. They were absolutely superb as feuding IRA brothers. I could have done without James Brolin. His character was out of place and his acting, as usual, leaves you unmoved. It's a movie worth watching on a rainy day. It is especially worth watching for the poem at the end - very moving."
2,Another useless Haynes manual,It was cheap so I bought it hoping it might have some useful info on my old van. Nope. Don't bother.
3,"It works, but it's tricky!","This cord does work, but it's a bit tricky. Syncing with a computer is no problem -- that worked fine for me. The charging part is a bit of trouble. The trick (as told to me by Zip-Linq's tech support) is that it only charges if the Axim is turned off -- and that's true. The problem is that if you're plugged into the computer to charge it up, the sync software keeps waking the Axim up every 10-15 minutes to resync thus stopping the charging. I actually had to kill the ActiveSync software running in the background to get it to leave the Axim off long enough to recharge.So it does work, but it's not as handy as you'd like."
2,Problems,"I recently returned this product to the vender because it failed to connect with my axim x50 to my laptop. My computer runs windows xp and has had no problem with any other USB peripherals, thus I can only assume it's a faulty item. The seller was kind enough to send a new item and this too has the same problem. Hence this product may have some issues.Dan"
4,Small but well suited,"This is a very practical magnifier. I purchased it for use in building models; for painting the smaller components. The lens is clear and the quality is good for the price.Cons: I think the arm should be longer as it tends to get in the way sometimes.All in all, for the price, I would definitely recommend this magnifier."
3,Lighted?,"I like everything about the magnifier, except the light is so hokey. I can't even tell if it's on or not. Surely it wouldn't cost the manufacturer to use a larger bulb to improve the performance of their product."
3,magnilamp,"Purchased this with the intention of using it for small detail work. Somewhat of a disappointment. The light is useless and dim, the base is lightweight and fragile, and the magnification is not useful. You get what you pay for, but I was hoping for a little more:("
2,magnifying glass with a stand,great product! like it because i don't have to hold it(it has a stand) and the magnification allows me to see most things that i need to.
4,Works Great,I bought this item as a gift for my husband and he loves it. The hands-free feature is the best. The light is a little dim though.
2,Pretty Useless!!,"Ok, to put it short,It falls over,just made really cheaply!! too big too!! takes up a ton of room..just don't like it at all,even the light is dim, but mostly it falls over!!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"This is handy. The base snaps off so you can put it in your bag to take to classes and workshops. However, the light is useless. It's dim and yellow like a dying flashlight. I was thinking it was an LED but apparently not. The price is great, so if you have good lighting where you plan to use it you won't be disappointed."
2,disappointment,This is far short of advanced matwork. I would be embarassed to title this advanced. It leaves out most of the 34 exercises that are found in the original work Contrology. One of the demonstrators is hardly ready for anything approaching advanced. You would be better served to get the book Pilates for Men that has genuinely advanced work and the entire 34 exercise mat work series in the original order and as it was intended to be done by Joe Pilates. Maybe the author meant for you to add the exercises in this cd to the beginning and intermediate programs. I don't know. If so he didn't make that clear.I consider this to be something of a fraud. Which is a shame because I think the book on matwork written by the author is pretty good.
4,"Cycle Challenge, Mindy Mylrea",Great workout. Made for the serious rider. Inspiring. Bubbly personality.
3,good core workout,"If you're looking for a tough core workout, I reccommend it. If you're looking for a cycling workout, look elsewhere. The spinning portion of this DVD is mostly high cadence pedaling. I tried using it a couple of times and decided it was a waste of my time and went back to my usual (Spinervals or Mindy Mylrea). The core strengthening portion is very good. The first time I used it, it seemed easy, but then two days later I couldn't move. Since then I've learned to respect the workout. The good thing is that you can make it more difficult as time goes by, by adding reps or adjusting the intensity, which he tells you how to do. This DVD should be titled Robert Sherman: Core Challenge, instead of Cycle Challenge."
3,Toning,"I was excited to try out Robert Sherman's cycle challenge workout and wasnt disappointed with the spinning part. However the music can do some improving. As for the toning exercises, he talks way too much and assumes that everyone following his workout is more than a beginner. I appreciate the fact that he explains the muscle he is working on with regard to proper form but there is no need to explain further than that. The flow is too slow to feel the benefits of the toning segment. I was waiting too long in between sets before he begins the next move."
2,Cycle Challenge,After reading the great reviews on Mindy Mylrea I was anticipating a really great ride. I was disappointed and found the DVD boring. Mindy and the music were boring. I'll stick to my classes at the YMCA.
4,Cyclew Challenge Review,Robert Sherman's Cycle Challenge is quite good. Cycle workouts are well done and the exercise segment was a pleasant addition/surprise.
3,Great album,"Very good album. The whole thing is very enjoyable, however I think the first track is the high point... it's actually why I bought the album. The other tracks are very heavy & enjoyable, but a little lack luster in comparison to ""I Am Vengeance."""
4,SOLID!!!,"Sure, there are only a few reviews for this album, and that would make any Black Metal fan skeptical of the brilliance therein. This is a very solid CD with zero filler, and speed! That is not to say there is no variation in tempo, there is. It just shifts from blinding speed to thrash, then back again, loaded with melodic guitar. The production is first rate and the muscianship is excellent. This makes a fine addition to any Black Metal collection. Highly recommended."
5,Blood of Amber is one of my favourite Amber books!,"Not much body to this review, but I just thought I'd say that the Amber series is one of my favourites, and I really like this book in particular. Scrof, the Dweller on the Threshold, is hilarious!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Merlin has been imprisoned by Luke, but he escapes. He tries a different tack by do something nice for Luke, and ends in a crazy situation due to a weird Trump.Those Trump things are just a lot of trouble, too many frequently encountered variant edition and different versions. Bad enough using them, imagine trying to collect them!"
5,Well-Kept Book.,I had to get this book for school and it was much cheaper than in our bookstore and it also came in mint-condition. I'm pleased :)
1,Religious gobbleygook,"I was recommended this book by someone, and the reviews seemed promising. If you are looking for a contemporary analysis of integrity of character, this is not it. It is nothing more than religious ramblings which equate integrity with obeyance of god. This book is ideal for those who do not for whatever reason think for themselves, but if you would rather define your personal integrity through objective criteria look elsewhere.However, the book is less obscene and violent than most christian writings, particularly the Bible. Thus, it is suitable for children."
5,An Invaluable Frame of Reference,"Carter is a master of framing and providing a context for complex issues like integrity. This is NOT a preachy book with platitudes about the need for integrity. It IS about defining integrity, the situations where it will be tested, and ways to think about integrity as you make your own decisions. In the end, it is a powerfully enabling book that I have referred to and recommended to friends and colleagues repeatedly for many years."
2,"Smug, but empty","Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target. His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering.While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic. ""We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people,"" he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms. Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince. His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls ""media culture"" and other left-wing ""evils.""Political hackwork."
5,Style and Function,"I love these placemats! I have the set in merlot, and use them all the time. Liquids bead up, much better than I imagined. I have a lot of spills between a 6 year old, 2 year old, and my husband, and these are so easy to clean. They look fantastic and are practical. What more could you ask for? I am buying the whole set in another color because I love them so much. I strongly recommend this one!"
4,Great mats,"I ordered both the Merlot and the light blue. They wash up very nicely without wrinkling or having the edges roll up. If something spills on them, the liquid beads so you can just blot dry with a napkin or something. They are attractive enough for company yet durable enough for everyday use."
4,Reflections cloth placemats,These are heavy weight with an attractive finish that seems to repell spills as advertized. Water and other liquids bead up on the surface and are easily wiped up with a paper towel. I have not used a drier on them and so cannot comment on whether they would dry flat if dried with that method.
3,Merlot placemats,"Although I like the place mats and they wash well, I was disappointed in the color. ""Merlot"" is a wine so I thought the color would be a darker shade like the wine but it is more of a cranberry color."
5,Fabulous product!,"I own 3 of these tablecloths and plan on buying more. I had a friend spill a glass of red wine on the white tablecloth and it beaded up just like the ad says. There was not a mark left. Only thing you have to be careful of, like any tablecloth, is oil stains. However, if you get them quickly on this microfiber cloth there will be little or no stain. I highly recommend this product."
4,Very good use,It is nice and pretty good to use. Food and liquid it is very easy to take it off. I am satisfied with the product.
3,Great for the First Few Uses,"I have used these placemats at least half a dozen times. At first, they were everything that other reviewers describe--elegant, stain-resistant, easy to wash, great texture. But time has not been kind. After a few wash cycles, the strings have started to come out along the edges, making them look cheap. The ""beading"" quality that keeps liquid from absorbing has been diminished, and certain stains have yellowed and will not come out.In comparison to other linens that I have used, these placemats looked impressive when I got them, but they turned out to be pretty average in the end."
5,WOW!,"I was at the book signing and got an autographed copy. I haven't read it yet, but the author is a hottie!!"
3,where are the songs?!?!,"I love Space Ghost Coast to Coast, but the best part about that show were the stupid crazy songs that Brak and Zorak sang. I bought Vol 1-3 and they don't have these songs on them. Not in special features either. The series is presented chronologically, it seems, which means the first set is sort of awkward and not as funny as later episodes. The second volume has a couple filler episodes and I just started Vol 3 and am sort of annoyed that there has been I think exactly 2 episodes with Brak in it. I still laugh out loud at some of the episodes, it's good to own it, but be aware you will not get some of the best stuff."
3,good item long wait,"Great deal on purchase but it took FOREVER to get delivered. Seriously, like 3+ weeks."
4,fun and upbeat,"surprisingly good even with repeated listens because the quality of the studio production in high. Its very upbeat and tongue-in-cheek, and most of it is very danceable. Poeple who take pop music seriously will hate it, but then again they probably wouldn't be looking at this review in the first place"
4,Name That Sample,"A good mix of music to make the room shake. An orchestral hit from ""James Bond"", a riff from Beck's ""Mixed Bizness"", and a lot that I've heard before but can't quite identify. A lot of fun."
5,Solid Wrench,Can't go wrong with this one. Heavy cast iron and virtually nothing that can break. Teeth have sharp grip and have worked flawlessly so far.
5,very nice,"nice wrench, I am just a homeowner but I needed to get a few pipe wrenches when tackling some plumbing jobs. Settled on this one and a 10 inch one as well. The wrench has good power and appears to be sturdy, hopefully I'll be handing this thing off to my children one day."
5,sir dyno is the best rapper of our time latian,"good films from darkroom familia veteranos, smile know cry later, blood and tears, dope game are some of their best films i order here in amazon, by 2pac"
5,Neville's 101,"As a casual Neville Brothers fan this is a great place to begin. The production of this cd is very gradual, because you are begining with primitive 1950's-60's soul and funk and gradually hearing more modern and funkier Nevilles sounds, In addition Aarons vocals are entirely different from all others.This 2 disc cd is however a vital education into the evolution of not just Neville Brothers, but the history their particular genre of music. So kick back and enjoy"
3,For the Hard Core Bird Lover,"I purchased the Birding by Ear cd collection as well as this one. I prefer the first, simply because it features more of my favorite bird friends; however, this, like the first one, is set up in a very easy to listen to and learn manner. Very soothing voice along with the song bird calls and songs - how can you go wrong?"
1,dont be fooled with the 4 MP,"it has a 2MP sensor so actually you're buying some bad 2MP camera. Which is kinda worthless. I bought it, thinking it was 4MP, thinking I would have excellent shots with it! But when I tried it out, pictures were really bad!! And it doesnt have a flash so... 2M is like emailing quality so.. dont be fooled, it says 4 MP everywhere, i got fooled too, but when I looked closer (too late) i saw it only had a 2mp sensor, this is with most of those cheap models.IT DOES HAVE AN EXCELLENT webcam functionality!! its a great webcam cause most webcams are only 1.3 MP. And it'll probably be a good mp3 listener too."
4,Not Bad pictures,I received this camera as a gift. Let it sit there for a couple of months without looking at it. Finally decided to try taking pictures. The first pictures I took didn't turn out that great. It turns out theres settings where you can choose the quality of the picture. I am not sure why this is since most people I know would almost always prefer top quality pictures.It takes pretty decent pictures and I plan to use it more now that I know it takes pretty good pictures. I just need to purchase an SD card to use so that I can take more pictures.
2,Dubious work,A thought-provoking but finally frustrating book whose theses are not backed by the facts. Read with caution. It's worth reading Peter T. Daniel's review of the book on the H-Africa list [H-Net Reviews] as Daniels has a lot of useful things to say on the book which may not be apparent to the non-specialist in Afro-Asiatic languages.
3,interesting but...,"I find it surprisingly deceiving that Ayele discredits the works of senior Ethiopianist in his fast arguments... The work doesn't seem as thorough as one would have expected, especially coming from reading the reviews. It's more of a historical account than anything else."
3,Useful but could be better,"Corel offers a lot of functionality and advanced features for the price. Where it slips up is in the import/export arena. It has a number of quirks with Word tables, and export to Illustrator and other Adobe formats just doesn't seem to work consistently. Service bureaus rarely support Corel so this is important. It could also use some more tutorials and more detailed walk throughs on how to do more advanced applications. With this it feels like trying to use Linux in a Microsoft world. With software, trying to save a few bucks or go against the mainstream comes with a cost."
4,Happy with purchase,Purchased a used copy of the CorelDraw to work on an older PC. Discs showed up in slightly used condition (as expected). Everything loaded well and is working great. Seller was good to work with. We received shipment notification and tracking info as expected. Very good experience.
3,Too picky. Too much to learn.,"I got this to make simple designs, for shirts, etc. I must say that it is extremely complicated. It's way too picky about what you can do and how you can do it. Not user-friendly at all. I've gotten a basic understanding of it over the past several months, but generally, it's just way too much. Too complicated. It did come with several other programs, such as a photo program, an animation program, etc. but all in all, I wish I had Photoshop."
2,Not much different--or better--than other versions,"""Enhanced snapping"", ""dynamic guides""? Who's Corel trying to kid? These are not substantial upgrades and are certainly not worth what Corel is charging for them. And ""PDF enhancement""? I think Corel writes that on every package now. I bet if Corel made a breakfast cereal, they would put ""PDF enhancement"" on the box. Actually, Corel should start thinking about making a breakfast cereal, as their products have been totally eclipsed by superior products from Adobe and Macromedia. So, the upshot is if you're looking for a good vector illustration or photo-editing package, stay away from Corel and buy something from proven and reliable companies like Adobe or Macromedia. At least their new product releases are actually NEW product releases."
3,Dissatisfied with upgrade,"In Photo-paint when rotating 1-bit objects at increments other than multiples of 90 degrees anti-aliasing fails and the object edges become jagged and random artifacts appear in the object background. Version 9 of the software did not have this problem. This is a major problem for those working with black and white images.After much stonewalling the customer service admitted that they were aware of the problem but had no plan for a fix. I wrote (not email) to president of Corel complaining that they should provide a fix. I received no response.Version 12 is no great improvement over version 9, and in my case it is worse. The company no longer seems concerned with customer service and a quality product."
3,CorelDRAW 12 Graphic Suite,"I just purchased CorelDRAW 12 Graphic Suite and it crashes for no apparent reason as did CorelDRAW 11 Graphic Suite until Corel developed new drivers for it. CorelDRAW 12 sometimes gives you a warning that it is going to crash and other times it does not. It crashes repeatedly! Not every two minutes, of course, but you can plan on it crashing faithfully. Until Corel fixes the problem, which usually takes them forever until they admit it. SAVE! SAVE! SAVE! & SAVE somemore. It's rediculous that they send out programs like this. So far, I've used only CorelDRAW 12 and not the other programs in the suite. Don't plan on Corel doing anything soon, except bragging up its virtues!"
1,Not enough new features to warrant purchase,"If you own a copy of CorelDRAW 9 or later, there isn't really any reason to purchase this product. Corel has done very little to the software, and some perennial Corel failings (poor text manipulation, large file sizes, slow redraw times and general bugginess) are still there. I'm actually not sure what they did to this suite that makes it markedly different from their other offerings. I think Corel RAVE has been improved, but seriously, who uses Corel RAVE? It doesn't come anywhere near to what Flash can do. Corel PHOTO-PAINT is still okay, but who needs it when PhotoShop is still better and the industry standard to boot? So, until Corel makes noticeable improvements to its products, I see no reason to spend money on them."
1,A nightmare in a box,"Yikes. Where to begin? Import/Export functions are totally whacked (I dare you to try to import Word tables or use Adobe formats with this release). DRAW still has major problems handling text and, unbelievably, the pdf powers of this app are woefully inadequate. Corel has also set a new level for disaster by making this product incompatible with not only Adobe and MS formats, but also with previous versions of CorelDRAW (text distortion is a big problem here). No wonder professional designers and service bureaus shun all things Corel. This product should have been released on April Fools Day."
3,What about the fonts?,Are the fonts Corel includes the same high-quality Bitstream fonts they included back when the version number was in single-digits?
2,Very bad crash issues and instability problems,"I've been using CorelDRAW and PPT since version 4, and I must say that the latest version, whether it be because of the patch or not, is widly unstable.For instance, 5 minutes ago I threw together a texture for a 3D model I'd been working on and as soon as I switched to the ""Brush"" swatch, crashed. The App Recovery Wizard doesn't even work correctly. It hangs and says the same thing each time.This crash happens often, reguardless of the operation you are doing and only seems to target certain machine setups.Tech support used to be good, however, they suck now and the sarcasm I've gotten from some of them made me want to punch glass objects.Please Corel, patch 12 so it works!AR"
4,WOW - Superb!,"WOW! It's simply fantastic.I don't give it 5 stars because I still think that (even though it's much cheaper than Adobe Photoshop) $300+ is a lot of money for software.Nonetheless: It's superb. I downloaded a free 15 day trial version from the Corel website and in minutes I was running at full steam ahead. The graphics suite has everything. Really, really, really good!Very intuitive. Granted I am familiar with graphics software including Adobe photoshop (not intuitive) and that helps a lot. But still, it's soooooo easy to use.Amazing. I couldn't ask for more... for now ;-)Time is money. And this software does it job flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Graphics were never so easy to create/ edit."
2,BUGGY,"Hey, I've been a hard core user of CorelDraw since it's inception, and people I have nothing but praise for this product, alas, Version 12 although with some terrific features it is the most bugged software I have ever used, I have found so many bugs that I have reported to Corel that I may as well be a QA tester for their future BETA's.I've been a proponent of Corel and their products for the last 14 years, now I'm (finally) moving to Illustrator, considering that it has caught up with features and the usability of Corel. Hey If you want to whip off rinki-dink design, simple signs or basic illustration this tool is for you, but if you do anything complex, expect crash, after crash. I have a log of over 1300 application failures in 1.5 years on 3 different systems, that Corel Tech's couldn't figure out. Maybe it was with the Transfer of power at the company, who knows.I foresee the Draw product defunct within 3 years. Unless they truly tighten up the software issues that plague the product."
2,Nothing Really New and doesn't do Mac after Version 11,"I've used Corel Draw and PhotoPaint since Version 2, on both the Mac and Windows systems. Corel has decided that they are after bigger bucks by sliding over to Microsoft and abandoning Mac users, who I have found to be the creative ones in the art world.Stay with Version 11 if you are a Mac user, and can't afford to move upward to Adobe, otherwise using Adobe products will make you smile, and you'll also get fewer computer ""FreezeUps""."
5,"Pratical, easy to follow advice","Fleming's objective is to provide a way of using a map & compass that is easy to remember as well as being not intimidating, and she achieves these results remarkably well in her book Staying Found. I have been out in the woods backpacking off-trail and have been able to use these techniques successfully, not only ""staying found"" but also navigating to small hidden lakes. Carol in California is lucky - in MY area, the declination is currently 19 degrees. Considering this value drifts back & forth, and that being even one degree off when you're taking your compass bearing can get you seriously lost, I think I'll stick with June's method rather than draw lines on my map that change from year to year."
1,Rushed and hard to follow,"If this is the same DVD, Essential Pilates for Athletes taught by Allan Menezes, then do not buy it. The movements are rushed, in order to do the workout properly you would have to repeatedly start and stop the DVD. I bought the disc hoping to be able to do the routine at home or in a hotel room but the boxes, straps, supports and weights he says to use prevent one from doing the assigned exercises effectively. Also, as a triathlete I was looking for more sport specific stretching and focus, there was nothing in this DVD that was specific to endurance athletes."
1,This is not a workout DVD!!!,"If you are looking for workout dvd, this is not for you!!! very disppointed when I got it. It is an instructional dvd, tell you how to do it, one pose by one pose!"
3,I remember these when I was a kid...,"These are the old FHE (family home entertainment) incarnations of the Robotech VHS tapes. Why anyone would buy them in 2012 is beyond me, buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut, if you do, keep in mind that this is a very very very edited version. The episodes are clipped to create one continuous movie length volume. An ingenious idea back in the vhs days of fastforwardforever, but with dvd and bluray, its a horrible thing. As far as the series itself, its Robotech, you either like it or you don't. Just be aware that this the episodes from FHE are all clipped."
4,One surprise after another.,"I first got ""caught"" by Clifford Brown's take on ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes."" That lured me to this CD: what a surprise! Where ""Smoke"" is straightahead melody riffs, here Clifford plays with power and versatility, soaring to a unique ""vision."" My mind wandered to his untimely death at age 26 and I wonder what else he could have given. You'll be glad he gave us this."
3,Nice pictures,"This book is divided into two parts: The first explains how to grow grapes while the second part focuses on how to make the wine. Very beautiful pictures are presented along the book and make it very enjoyable for reading. However, the amount of information is rather limited. For instance, the explanations about diseases in grapes or the pruning procedure are rather telegraphic, and unsatisfactory. Much better explanations may be found in ""The Grape Grower"" by Rombough or ""From Vines to Wines"" by Cox. I find the second part of the book somewhat better. I especially liked the ""homework assignments"" which supposedly help to develop the organoleptic senses."
5,Puzzled by human behavior?,"Are you puzzled by human behavior? Do you wonder why your lover just destroyed your relationship? Why politicians pick a fight?Why we all seem so attracted to confident people? And what exactly is the origin of this confidence? Do you wonder why some people can't control their passions? And why others are locked into a cool, detached intellect? Western psychologists have totally missed the boat trying to explain personality archetypes,they have subdivided human personalities into categories that are way too narrow. Who, after all, isn't a little bit obsessive-compulsive or a little bit ADHD? Buddhists ride to the rescue with their 6 ego realms, described in detail in this excellent book. With some practice, you will be able to read people like a book, and you will be very frightened (at times), by what you find. Remember...Buddhists don't have a very high regard for ego, so be ready for a dose of depressing realism."
4,Not totally 5.8 GHZ,"I just received this product. It works great, but I found from the manual that the phones use both 5.8 GHZ and 2.4 GHZ, one for sending from the base to the receivers and the other in the reverse direction. I didn't see it in the product introduction of the Amazon site."
4,great system!,"I bought this phone back in July, and bought an extra handset (4 total). I was replacing a vTech system that I loved - a 2.4gHZ with 4 handsets. It has all the same great features - speakerphone on each handset, intercom which can be used like transfer because it will put a caller on hold while you call the phone of someone else in your house (to alert them the call is for them). Two things would make this system perfect - 1, a speaker phone on the base and 2, a message signal on the handsets."
1,Not worth it,"As mentioned in previous reviews, this phone does not have a battery indicator. It also does not tell you how low your battery is. So in the middle of the conversation, it just goes dead without warning. I had Motorola replaced the battery, because I was only getting a talk time of 30 minutes max... which is due to the phone always continuously being charged. But how is a consumer suppose to know when to charge the phone if there is no battery indicator. Stay away from this phone."
3,Pretty Decent,Actually I thought I already reviewed this ablum but I will give it another shot.I brought this album because someone told me to and I loved the first song but couldn't really follow the rest. He had some remakes of some old songs (or atleast it sound that way). I gave him 3 starts for effort. I think he has alot of potential if he could be more original.
5,"High, Wide, & Lonesome","The author moved to the Colorado frontier at the turn of the century when he was a preteen. His descriptions of the hard work for survival that his family endured, along with the peacefulness of a time that was not burdened by extra possessions, made me homesick for a different time. He reminded me that a lot of what we are missing is time to sit and look at the sky (there was no school nearby, so he didn't attend one). It was not an easy time, and illnesses before penicillan could be deadly. But courage and love went a long way, even though those words were not mentioned. I was quite moved by this family's determination to succeed."
4,"High, wide and lonesome",I enjoyed this book. It was a good insight into life on the prairie in the pioneer days. The unbelieveable amount of work that was just expected and never complained about was really amazing. No wonder these people were so physically fit. They didn't eat much and worked hard all day long. The amount of time spent traveling was mind bogling compared to this day and age.
5,Life on the Frontier,"I love stories about life on the frontier, especially true stories, this one written from a young boy's perspective. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Good read,"I thought this was a very good read, the author covered the historical period of settlers well in this part of the US and also weaved in a captivating tale about the weary difficult daily hardships of everyday life and the resourcefulness of the farmers and cattlemen of this time."
3,Enjoyable read but simplistic,"This was an enjoyable read about what it was like to homestead on the Colorado eastern high plains in the early part of the 20th Century. It was also a good accounting of how most, if not all, homesteaders existed at a bare subsistence level for the first years of their settlement and most never made it to ""prove up,"" the time when they actually got a deed to their homestead. The book was an easy and quick read but it seemed almost at a grade school level - and that may have been the author's intent. I just would have liked more detail about the time, the people and the dynamics of the frontier area."
2,Book great! Condition poor.,"I read this book on Kindle and loved it. I wanted to have a hard copy to share with others, I bought a copy rated good for $32., mind you, since it is out of print. What I received was a book so used that it is falling out of the cover. Be very careful of the ratings on used books. You are kind of over a barrel with them."
4,A reminder of how hard life was on the frontier,"This is a historical story with no main plot. So if you're interested in intrique and mystery this book is not for you. But, if you ever wondered how life really was on the western frontier in the early 20th century, this is it. Heartwarming as well as cruel the author does a remarkable job of reminiscing about a few years of that life. The ones that survived and stuck it out were tough....the rest did the minimum homestead period , sold the land, and moved back to more hospitable environs. A story so well told you think you're there with them."
4,A very good read!,"Captured my interest from the very first chapter and held it until the end. It provides a very personal and well written history of the struggles, tough decisions, and the joys that eastern Colorado homesteaders experienced."
4,Evocative,"This was a lovely and lovingly written account - however, the plot and story were somewhat simplistic and overly nostalgic.Still, he's very evocative of the high plains, and I really appreciated that."
5,Saved From the Wreckage,"The NIV Bible has allowed me to read the Bible and understand it for the first time in my life. I have always known God had a plan written for me but it seemed like it was in a foreign language and unreachable.It is easy to read and the scripture reference which relate to different topics has helped me to see the Bible is all relevant and not just a compilation of unrelated stories. The Old and New Testaments are brought together with clarity with Old Testament prophesies vividly revealed in the New Testament.As a new Christian, it truly is the Bible I read and study everyday of my life so that I may continue to build a closer relationship with God."
5,Please fix the typo on the review I did for this book.,"There is a typo on the last sentence of my review that I did last week for this book where it states I I've, please remove the I.Thanks Nate Richey"
1,Disappointment,"The inordinately overpriced trash can doesn't even work as well as it should. I assumed when ordering a trash receptical it would at a minimum maintain a shape -- this doesn't. It's square shape bows inward (concave) on all four sides. I should have returned it but didn't realize how it holds up 'til after returning from a trip. This was the first really bad product I've ever ordered from Amazon after yrs. of business. 'Have only myself to blame, however; in too big of a hurry."
5,An excellent combination of E.Annie Proulx and John Cheever,"Like E. Annie Proulx, Charlotte Bacon's writing is fresh and compelling, sprinkled liberally with incandescent imagery. Like Cheever, seemingly small events, like a weekend in the country, a troubling discovery made by a daughter in her father's apartment, or a whale-watching trip, all mark tidal points in the lives of her characters. With nary a false note, this young writer carries us through the lives of men and women facing the end of marriage, the beginning of a pregnancy, the repercussions of the loss of a job on a wealthy family. Such grace and assured prose is rare in young writers, and I'm already waiting for her next. An excellent collection of stories (and prize-winning, too, if you check the book jacket)."
1,Dissatisfaction,"Long past the time it should have arrived, I still have not received the book that I ordered. This is a major disappointment."
4,The last trip,"A fairly good book on doing funerals, it wasn't quite what I wanted, but the price was good and I can use it."
5,Mago de Oz.....they blow me away,"This has to be the best concert DVD ever. Every song Mago de Oz performs is done to perfection. Seeing this DVD makes me want to hop the next flight to Spain to see the sights, meet the people, and go to a Mago de Oz concert. If any of the following bands appeal to you, you'll be floored by Mago de Oz: Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Flogging Molly, Van Halen, Yngwie Malmsteen, Hammerfall, etc. The included biographical DVD also gives you a little look behind the scenes. All in all, a superb DVD, and worth every penny."
3,Spray gun,this gun is easy to clean and will last for a while. i have had it for 3 years now. it has a good spray pattern. only downfall is that you do have to thin all paints you spray.
2,Review,"Product is dated and the little metal rings that the laces go through fell off. They're not uncomfortable, but I would definitely recommend another brand! Product took forever to arrive!!!!!"
3,For the price they're alright. :),"I just got these for a costume idea, but I also wore them around a little bit. They did squeeze my little toe some, but when I tied them properly they worked fine. They are nice looking, and pretty durable."
3,Good but sizing is difficult,"The boots are great but they are very narrow and it took three tries to get the correct size. I wear a 10 in other shoes, but it took an 8 to fit! Wish they came in a wide size, not just EE."
4,Amazon Purchase,As ever I am more than satisfied with my purchase from an Amazon vendor. I received my boots within a week of ordering.
1,It is too tight for me.,I can not wear it because that is too tight for me. the shoes still lay in my box. so bad.
2,So-so,"I find it has few uses. There is one hole on each side, so it can not be taken on rainy or snowy days. And in summer, it is a little warm to wear it. But it is cheap which is its most advantage."
3,Buy these boots for outdoor activities or cosplay ONLY,"If you've never worn real combat boots before, you're in for a shock. These ain't your daddy's Doc Martins. Get some insoles and expect to spend some break-in time. Great boots, though."
4,needs insole,i love the boots they are perfect and you cant beat the price the only problem i had is there was no insole not even a factory one just nothing but the bottom of the shoe but still not a bad price even if you include buying an insole
4,Good product,These boots were great for the price have had better boots was very happy with quality and speed of shipment
3,black jungle boots,"See the nice shine in the photo...well, you're not going to get that. You're going to get a ""matte"" finish on the leather portion. I bought these to spit shine for my VFW work...not going to happen I'm afraid.Comfort: just OKQuality: one of the aluminum eyelits is already dislodged.Will I sent them back...no ...too much hassle; besides, they didn't cost much"
4,boots,the only reason why I didn't give i 5 stars is cause even though they are size 9's they don't feel like it they feel allot bigger so they don't fit me all that well
2,These boots are more than a size too big.,"Then the box arrived I could sell the cigarette smell from outside the box. WOW, the few days I had the box in my car ready to send back my car smelled of stale cigarette smoke."
5,Great Boots!,My grandson really liked the look and the fit. They were just what he was looking for! He wore them to school right a way and received many compliments.
1,poor quality,"started to crack after a week of wear, I should have spent more on something else that would not fall apart so soon."
3,More of a costume boot,"The boots are well worth the price. However, the insole is non existant. If you want to wear this boot for any amount of time I highly recommend investing in some Dr. Scholl's."
2,Ulta Boots Black,When you receive the boots you will notice the craftsmanship is quite sloppy on the sole. Mine looks like they took to pieces and glued them together. There is also a piece of the sole just glued on like a chunk came off. I wouldn't care so much because I payed 30 dollars but when I placed them on they where way to big. Order a size smaller or maybe even two and the shoes should fit fine. What I ended up doing is going to walmart and they have a very similar shoe that is a lot more comfortable that costs 31.32 with tax and everything. I ended up giving these to goodwill about a week after I received them.
5,Just like my old boots...,I'm an Old Corp Marine and need a pair of jungle boots to replace my old ones. The new boots they have in the military didn't suit me and was happy to see these boots at a really good rate. I couldn't find one my size and order them through Amazon. They arrived by UPS and after breaking them in they work just fine.
3,"Decent boots, but low quality","These boots will certainly serve their purpose for awhile, but I don't expect them to last. After wearing them regularly for my job as landscaper, they are beginning to show signs of wear. Several of the gromets on the lacing have come loose. Also, the sole is beginning to to separate from the heal slightly. I did not encounter the problem with the soles that some people had. Interested buyers should keep in mind that I tend to VERY hard on my shoes, and even expensive heavy duty work boots tend to fall apart on me within a year. For the price, I would still recommend these."
4,Nice boots for the money,Decent for the money!I really bought them for myChe Guavara Halloween costume!Buy the way I hate CHE!
4,Reliable External Drive,"I am a video editor, so I need my firewire drive to be fast and reliable. The Acomdata HD320FE5-72 E5 320 GB FireWire400 External Hard Drive is just that. I have approximately three hours of video, render files, images and motion graphic elements on the drive and I have tons of room left over. In fact, I have stored all my media on the external drive and Final Cut Pro is referencing them through firewire. I have made DVDs using DVD Studio Pro, also referencing the files on the external drive. My laptop has one firewire port so I had to hook up the capture deck to the external drive. In order to get it to work I had to power up the laptop and the deck BEFORE turning on the drive. Otherwise, FCP did not recognize the deck.I have three of these drives, two for work and one for home. I recommend them highly."
5,Reliable for your data,"I bought two acomdata 160GB external HD, which looks exactly like this 320GB one. The quality is very good, very reliable, never feel hot whenever I touch the shell. One is very quiet, another has clear sound but still ok. I never opened the box to see which company's hard disk is inside it, but my two years use already comfort me this is a good product that can be relied on."
3,Second unit,"My first unit died after 13 months. Fortunately, it was only a backup unit and I didn't loose anything substantial.I had an extended warranty thru Comp-USA and they were GREAT about taking care of it.I am on my second unit for two months now and so far so good. I have another 75 gig drive that has been working fine for years. Never a bump. But it is by another maker.I would love to recommend this unit cause when it works, it works GREAT! I guess I will know better in 11 months. Let's see it this one dies too."
1,Piece of junk dies in 18 months.,It works fine for about 18 months. Then dies. All data lost forever. I searched the web and discovered others had the same experience with this piece of junk.
2,There are better choices,"The good news is that this drive functionally works. That's where the good news ends. The backup software is not intuitive, if not confusing. When I made a mirror of my PC's hard drive, it hosed Thunderbird by adding a second In box, second sent folder, etc. I was never able to resolve/undo this. When I used the software to back up my recent data, instead of over writing the same folder, it kept making sub folders which I would later have to go and delete. After doing this a few times, the drive became nearly 20% fragmented and I had to use Windows to defragment the drive! I just got a new PC and tried to use this drive with Win7 and it would not recognize this drive. I called their tech support who said their was nothing they could do. So guess I will try to reformat the drive myself and make it still usable. My next hard drive will not from Acommdata."
1,Mine crashed!!!,Mine crashed only after a year. NO OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT! and I lost all my data. I should last longer than one year!
2,Good Device But Don't Bet On It,"I purchased this product about 10 months ago. The first couple of backups went well. Recently I needed to rebuild my system. To ensure a good backup I had Acomdata tech support staff walk me through the steps. On the surface the backup appeared to work great. However, when I needed to restore my files I could see all folders and files but none of the files were usable. Acomdata said the files were corrupted during the backup process. Since all the files worked well prior to the process, its either an issue with the device or the Redemption software. The tech staff who support Redemption were also equally useless. In the end, I lost several months of data inspite of working directly with Acomdata staff to cover my bases. I have since transferred other files with this device but without using the Redemption software or Acomdata tech staff and it seemed to work okay. However, I will never fully trust the device nor the vendor's staff again."
4,Treal Nice Record,"This is another good record that reps the Bay area's underground rap scene. A lot of the tracks on this record may be found elsewhere, but it is nice to have them all on one press. 'Davin Rims' and 'Shout-N-Scream' are somewhat less published among Thizz tracks and stand-bys like 'Stupid' or 'Ah Bitch' are good to have not to mention four or five other tracks on this joint that I really like to hear."
2,Installation Issues,"I ordered these for my 2003 Toyota Tacoma. The installation instructions required you to ""screw"" the liners into the vehicle carpeting using supplied fasteners. I didn't want to mess with the factory installed carpeting so I sent the Nifty liners back and went with Husky liners. The Husky liners fit right in without any difficulty. I had Husky liners for 15 years in my 1996 Tacoma and they were great. The only vehicle modification required with the Husky liners was removing the factory floor clip that kept the carpet floor mat from moving. I would recommend going with the Husky liners over the Niftys."
2,Nat and Natali's songs,"It was disappointing, as I expected the cd to be the remake's of Nat'ssongs with Natali singing together. I know he's been gone for years, butI have heard the songs where Natali is singing in between and harmonizingwith him."
3,Stlll slogging away at this one,Ole Mr. Tacitus assumes I know a lot of the characters in this. And I don't. So its slow going.
4,The book on Imperial Rome,"The Annals is without a doubt the most important book ever written on Imperial Rome, and the most important one dealing with the Julio-Claudian emperors. Focusing on the reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE) and ending suddenly during the reign of Nero (54-68 CE), Tacitus pulls no punches in this history. Extremely critical of the emperors, Tacitus is at his best describing the terror of the trials that began under Tiberius and which eventually paralyzed the Roman state. Tacitus also relates in detail the various military campaigns undertaken during the period. A word of advice---know your Roman history when you start this book. All the names and places can be extremely confusing to the novice. Unfortunately the section on Caligula is lost, although it is not hard to guess what Tacitus would have said about him. Read this book!"
4,Because it is an Annal. . .,"In response to the review below, the book deals with minor incidents and not with the overriding theme's or the nature of the times because it is an Annal, not a history."
5,Dance till you Drop -- then play it again....,"The ""Radikal Techno"" series has its ups and downs (one of its biggest downs was the 'best of Radikal Techno'), but this is a major UP. Radikal Techno 4 is a killer CD: a must have for dance music, or trance & techno lovers.Every track here is both listenable and danceable. Latin sounds, Reggae, new wave, and electronica fuel the beats here. Standout tracks include MELLO TRAX ""Outta Space"" (not the old Billy Preston tune, just in case you were wondering), SM TRAX' ""Got The Groove"", and LA MORENA's ""Decadencia"". A remixed? version of Zombie Nation's KernKraft400 kicks things off in a shimmering trance mode, and the songs just keep getting better & better. At a recent party, no one noticed that this CD played over and over... the guests couldn't get enough of it.Check it out! Techno dance, trance, breakbeat, and electronica fans will love this one."
5,NOKTURNAL,"I,M JUST REALLY REALLY GETTING INTO THE UNDERGROUND SCENE. I LOVE THIS CD. IT'S MIND-BLOWING TRACKS 16 &18 ARE SENSATIONAL. IF YOU DONT OWN THIS CD YOU MUST BUY NOW.PEACE!!!!!!!!"
4,Sounds from a mysterious community,"I don't really know this kind of music, except that it is intently ""exceptional"". I like that, and I like the energy in his playing. His pianist is a willing accomplice in that the ideas stay compelling without...I dunno, sounding like an exercise? I would like to find out what music these guys listen to for inspiration. But who told this guy that plinking is listenable? Plinking. Oooh boi.Jim Hall is the furthest thing from my mind. Sonny Sharrock with out the distortion. Better melodic ideas. Musical accompianment that is musical. G'wan, buy it."
2,Such a waste of time and paper,"Not much value here. Countless pages spent discussing food, drugs, health issues all possible contributing factors leaving the reader with too much information, unfocused information and tedious reading. Will not recommend to clients."
5,the BEST canine behavior book in my library,"When faced with problem behaviors in a rough collie back in the 70's, I read every dog behavior book on the shelves at the time. William Campbell's book was the only reference which addressed the issues I needed to understand. Campbell's description of 'active defense reflex' vs 'passive defense reflex' dogs made all the difference in my understanding of Shasta's behavior. He gave me all the advice I needed to turn this behavior around with very specific instructions which worked to perfection. We went on, after reading this book, to earn a CD in obedience whereas before I could not even touch his body without being bitten ('active defense reflex'). I recommend this book to anyone I contact who is dealing with dog behavior problems and I'm very interested to see how this new edition compares to the one I purchased in the 1970's!"
2,Mac Owner,"I bought this CD-RW a little less than a year ago. I thought the price was right at the time, since it included a rebate at the time. I own a Mac G3 (blue & white) running OS 8.6. I bought this so I could back-up some of the more important things from my hard drive. I think it's a bit slow, and I agree with what others have said about waisting most of you CDR's. I have been able to save my photos folder fine, but I can't seem to back-up anything like Palm Pilot info, e-mail, or any of the other things I want stored before doing a fresh install of my OS. When I try a burn in ""simulation mode"", many times my computer just locks up. I'm hoping the OS upgrade will help with some of these bugs.If you are buying a CD-RW for it's looks and don't plan to use it for anything too big, this will work fine. If you need a serious machine, that you can use for back-up, don't bother with this."
1,"Terrible, harmful even...","This drive is terrible- stay away... It burned one usable cd- the first, then never again after teasing me with one good burn. I run Win2k, and I got the infamous blue screen of death with the adaptec (roxio) apps it shipped with. It is completely unreliable and seems to be burning fine until the very very very last minute when the lid pops open and the computer tells me the was an error in the device. On top of which, the spindle is too hot to touch, even when the drive is OFF! Design flaw? Can't be good for the sensitive electronic inside (they put heatsinks and coolers on cpu's and videocards for a reason...) I also tried it on my Windows 98 laptop, and the Iomega install apps always had error messages coming up, and I had to install the drivers for it separately... This thing is nothing but trouble. Looks cool though."
1,Not ready for consumption,"I got one of those, together with Easy CD Create 4.02, and it does not work right. I am an experienced user, and I strongly believe that the software has a ton of problems. My impression is that Iomega tech support knows that they are selling something that does not work right, but as the software comes from Roxy, they are unable to help. Iomega used to be a great brand, in fact the best in the field. Too bad."
1,Toshiba users beware...,"After reading some of the glowing reviews, I feel a little awkward being critical; however, the Predator has been less than useful with my Toshiba 4100XDVD notebook. I feel like the Coaster King, cranking them out like hamburgers at McDonalds. I'm running the latest drivers and I'm also using Roxio's (Adaptec) Platinum version 5.01 software to TRY and burn my CDs. But I'm still getting about a 50% burn rate at best. CDs are cheap but my time isn't. So, when the burner burps at the end of a half-hour, I get to restart the whole process and keep stacking my coasters higher.I should have known better. My friends were warning me not to buy any Iomega CD-RWs but when I read that it was the Editor's Choice at PC Magazine, I figured they couldn't be wrong (I'll read their stuff with a grain of salt from now on). Perhaps this burner was designed with the Mac user in mind but it definitely conflicts with my Toshiba notebook.Hope this helps."
1,Step Away from the Sales Rack!!!!,"I've tried several burns and never got a CD. It's error messge after error message. I had to install the driver's from the web page, the instructions on the CD that came with it refused to open, it constantly tells me I dont' have a blank CD in the writer and I'll open another new CD-R and put it in the writer just to get the same message. I'm on my way to return it right now. DO NOT buy this product unless you like being frustrated."
4,I love this burner,"I was a little nervous about buying this cd writer because it looked so cool, and I had such a lousy experiance with the last one I bought from a different company. I am glad to say that this is a pretty good burner... It worked a lot better than the last one did and it was definately worth the money. Do not buy any of the HP burners.. you will be glad you didn't."
2,It might work for a while but I'd watch out with Iomega,"Ok, I don't have this exact model. But I had a discontinued Iomega 4x4x6 external CD-RW and it broke after about six months and was generally not good quality. I do give it 2 stars because it was decent when it was working and did set up okay. Problems seem really common with Iomega; I would not buy another Iomega item unless there was a very compelling reason. I had an internal Iomega Zip drive and that broke too. Iomega has real quality control problems and appears to be willing to release products before they are proven to be reliable. Because of Iomega's particularly bad record with external CD-RW's, I would be HIGHLY hesitant to get this specific device."
2,Quite a bit of of a learning curve,Spent two evenings with Iomega tech staff modifying software. fairly slow copier.
1,Beware of this drive...,"...unless you feel adventurous. I've had the Predator since March of 2001, and I'll say this much for it: it's properly named. Because it is indeed a predator. Unfortunately, it's prey in my case has been stacks and stacks of helpless and innocent CD-R discs. I have a Mac G3 running OS 8.6, although from some of the other reviews I've read here that doesn't seem to make any difference. This product apparently doesn't discriminate when it comes to OS's and hardware. I won't even go into the incredibly long list of everything I tried to get this thing to work. Just suffice it to say that if you can think of it, I tried it. Save your money and buy a good Firewire drive instead."
4,"Not for OS X, but....","I bought this drive only because it was Win/Mac compatible.But When I actually tried to install the driver/software, I realized that this drive is not compatible with OS X. I went to their website, but the driver was not available for OS X. What I like about it is that it doesn't take up much space. It's not the fastest CD burner on the market, but I don't burn 20 CDs a day and this is good enough. I hope they will come up with OS X driver soon."
1,Stay away from Iomega...,"I've owned 4 of these predator drives. They are poor quality. I've had nothing but problems with them. Replaced 3 times by Iomega under warranty, and the 3rd replacement (4th drive total) broke. I finally wrote off my losses and bought a Creative SB1394, and it's a flawless piece of equipment."
1,Nothing but junk,"Shame on Iomega for selling this product. It is flimsy, shoddy, and unreliable. If you've got a lot of time to waste, and don't mind destroying a stack of CD-Rs, you might burn a few successful CDs. But I plugged this thing into three different computers and had the same inconsistent results each time. The list of potenial errors is truly amazing. There seem to be an unlimited number of ways that this product can ruin discs. Perhaps a dependable external cd-burner has not yet been built. But this one is so terrible, I doubt I'd buy anything with the Iomega name on it again."
1,Don't buy,"Software loaded just fine but, I never got the item to power up. looks very cheaply made. I don't know if the power supply is bad or what? The led lights wouldn't come on and I couldn't get the unit to power up. what's up with the stupid connected module in the back? No phone support on off hours, so I boxed it up and sent it back. Now I'm looking at a yamaha internal instead."
4,will work with windows ME,"One last thing I forgot to mention- I have windows ME on my computer and even though Easy CD creator (the software provided for PC's) was not meant to be used on Windows ME, it will still work. The software mentions that it is compatible only with windows 95/98/2000, but I have had no trouble using it with the ME version. The deluxe upgrade may be the culprit as I have not been able to get that to work properly."
3,Works Great with a few design flaws,"I have had this burner for 4 months or so. Mine works great also, but I find the modular plug flimsey, and I don't understand why it sits there and pulses the cd motor when closed and empty. I have to unplug the thing when it is not in use so that I don't have to listen to it whirring every 5 seconds. Also the electronic eject button is kind of bogus. You can't open the disk door when it is not plugged in, and I think that it is a weak link. Over all I am happy though. I anticipate that Iomega will correct these things with the next model. Wait if you can. Also, firewire would be nice, the burning process isn't slow, but it could always be faster!!"
1,This Drive is The worst Drive I ever Bought,"Absolutly DO NOT BUY this drive I bought it and it didin't work so I sent it back to iomega and they gave me a new one and that one didin't work either.Do your self A favor AND DON""T BUY THIS DRIVE"
1,Slow and No Help,"My unit worked fine initially, and then stopped writing on most commercial discs. The first response from their so-called support group took three days by e-mail. They offered suggested corrections one at a time, with additional delays before offering the next step. Phone help is not available except during working hours. It took over a week to get instructions which could have been sent initially, none of which worked. After all that they said another unit would be sent at an indefinite time in the future. That was twelve days ago, and I've heard nothing since."
1,Temperamental Drive,I have no previous experience with any other CD-RW outboard drive but this one is very temperamental. It does not like being plugged into an outboard USB hub. It only works when I give it the one onboard USB port on my laptop (and actually works well). All my other USB devices don't have any problem sharing but this drive is selfish. The success rate in creating CD's is low and the frequent error messages are not real helpful in diagnosing and resolving the problem. Will often get to the point where the only option is to reboot and hope that the drive wakes itself up. If you can dedicate an onboard USB port to it you may have success but if you need to plug it into a hub you might consider some other drive.
1,DOA,This item arrived dead on arrival. Seller has not responded to my emails. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
2,I hink the Iomega Predator 4x4x6 Sucks,"Last year I bought from dabs.com the said ext CDRW, initially I've had no probs & thought it great.Once one learns to burn music at the slowest speed.Now though I'm going through backup of backups of CDR discs as well the drive's conflicting with the PC ie causing it to freeze.Iomega support are no help, to them their drives are perfect, it's the PC's fault.I think not.The moral is DON'T BUY IOMEGA...."
2,"Attractive and Portable, But be WARNED....","This drive is cheap, portable, interesting looking, and does the job...barely.I bought one used on ebay to take to a job site and do backups on a laptop. My mistake was not reading reviews on this drive and not knowing its limitations. I have encountered nearly every problem listed on other reviews, plus a few new ones.Do not even bother using the drive to write at higher speeds you will only make coasters.Also, forget about CD-RW! I have tried at the lowest speeds and I cannot even tell you how many times I have corrupted the file system of the disk in one way or another. I have to do data retreval on one disk I was stupid enough to 'Move' files to. Worked fine...but when I went to view the files the laptop hung...forever - after it was rebooted the CD-RW was corrupted. Files were still there but need to be recovered.Basically, write at 2x onto CD-R's. Burn a few and unplug the drive because it WILL get hot like others have said."
4,Blame the media...,"I was hesistant to buy this drive after all the bad reviews, but I've been very happy with my purchase. The only problem that I had was when I used media (both CD-R and CD-RW disks) that were not made by Verbatim. After having problems and contacting tech support, I was told that Iomega only recommends disks made by Verbatim and a couple of other companies (sorry, I can't remember which ones). I switched back to my Verbatim disks and haven't had any other problems."
3,Not overly impressed...,"I was excited when I bought this, I was expecting IOMEGA to come out with another great product, but they didnt do so well on this one.Sure, it works.... It burns CD's, BUT the drive has bugs, it acts strange, doesnt want to read blank CD's, and gets VERY hot during use. The software package that it comes with is less than perfect, although it is usable. I have had better luck with IOMEGAs other drive, and with drives from other manufacturers."
1,Worst electronic I have seen in years,"While not a computer expert I have been involved with PC's since the Commadore 64. I have installed hard drives, memory, scanners, read only CD's. in several systems. Software installation was a piece of cake but when it came to writting a CD it was a gigantic PITA. Data underrun errors nearly everytime. I tried to write ~200 MB to a disk and it would hang up with no error message. Would have to cold boot. I managed to ruin 5 RW disks and got 1 disk to write after hrs. of rebooting. I sent this lemon back after two days of fustration. Would not recommend to anyone. Running Win 98 with 64MB."
1,Huge Time Waster and Coaster Maker,"This piece of junk has been a problem ever since I purchased it. I have been able to burn a total of 4 cd's with it and when I complain to Iomega I get no response. I upgraded to Win XP at home and find that the software does not work with XP, and that it will cost me $50 to get new software that will make it work. I finally sppend the $50 and it still does not work and Iomega still refuses to respond. The only thing I get is on their junk email list. In my opinion Iomega Sucks, and I will never purchase another Iomega product"
1,"Made Cheaply, Works Poorly","This is a poorly made product and has been nothing but a headache. As another reviewer indicated, I made a lot of coasters."
1,Stay Away!,"I also found the tech support nice, but it has never worked consistantly. Tons of coasters!"
3,"Works great on my PowerBook, not so on my Win2000 system.","I had a PII 266 Windows 2000 system when I purchased this drive and 90% of the CDs I burned turned out to be coasters. I then bought my PowerBook and it's been working flawlessly with my Mac and OS X. I'm now looking for the firewire adaptor for this drive, but I haven't been able to find anyone that sells it."
1,Complete Garbage,"The product is not only worthless, so are the costumer service and tech departments at Iomega. I have spent several months and over three hours on the phone with these incompetent rejects. I wouldn't dare buy anything else from this joke of a company. If you do, good luck!!"
1,Works less than 1/2 the time,"I'm somewhat of a beginner to all of this, but when I drop a couple hundred bucks on something I expect it to work more often than not. I have no problem copying CDs but when I try to burn MP3's all I ever get is error messages. The Iomega website tells me to download the new version of Toast for my iMac and the problem will be solved...yeah, right. The technical support is practically non-existent. Overall, I'd have to say I'm disappointed."
1,Great when working,I purchased this drive and had great success the first time I used it. The next time I used the drive my troubles started. The Iomega product support is the worst I ever encountered. The tech lines disconnect you when they are busy and the email response is a joke. They do not respond.
1,Wish I had listened to the people who said this was junk,Have been trying to use this for about 6 months to back up data. Never ending problems. Have no confidence whatsoever in product. Strongly recommend you select something else. Not even Iomega's software. Belongs to Adaptec - which is now Roxio - who have no interest in making this thing work.
1,Listen to the masses and save your money,"I bought the Predator drive and regret not reading the reviews on Amazon.com! Initially, the drive burned CD's just fine. I used the drive for 6 months before I encountered the same problems of not recognizing blank CDR's, buffer underruns, system freezes, etc.I updated the firmware as instructed by Iomega to no avail. I've tried running the drive under different OS's and hardware. I even upgraded the software(Hotburn).Those of you who haven't encountered problems (yet) are just lucky. I'm no novice and you can trust all the other reviews including this one, DON'T FORK OUT YOUR HARD EARNED DOUGH FOR THIS DRIVE. Regards."
4,Software available for purchase online,"Just got this book. Looks to be avery good manual, with lots of technical detail.However, the 191 page book has about 100 pages in the middle devoted to somewhat superfluous examples of line intersections.I wanted to let everyone know that the software is available for purchase at the author's home page: http://www.net-shopper.co.uk/creative/celtic/index.htm"
2,it's selling something,"Contrary to it's title this book is in no way a practical handbook. At first glance when you read through the introduction and part one, the instructions it gives sound easy to follow and it makes it seem as though all this requires is a grid and some mindless drawing of lines. But it turns out that it is the exact opposite. There are numerous rules to remember and different combinations that aren't allowed to be near eachother and the border area is where he really loses you, the structure of the border changes the rules for the entire knot all of which must be memorized unless you want to end up with a jumble of loose ends. It would be enough to say that it sounds quite viable in theory but is completely inviable in practice. I believe the main goal of this book was to sell the computer program that was developed by the author"
5,A fun mystery,"I've been reading through this series and have enjoyed it very much. This particular book is set during the Christmas season and has a great feel to it. I liked how Gloria figured out the mystery, and I also learned some interesting facts about helium."
2,Not What I Expected,"This video only has four different songs of Ike and Tina. They were good but I think the whole DVD should have been of them since the Title is Ike and Tina Turner. If you want an excellent DVD that will make you bounce and is nothing but Tina, I strongly suggest Tina Turner One Last Time Live In Concert. I Rate that DVD 25 stars!"
2,Ike & Tina Turner and Others,"I thought this product would have a lot of Ike & Tina Turner's songs, however, it only had about 4. The rest of the songs came from people I had no idea who they were. This DVD promoted those groups. I wish I could send it back."
4,A Taste of Genius,"This is another very good edition of A&E's biography series about a man who is one of my favorite authors. It covers the whole of his life including some of the most important incidents--his family being sent to debtors' prison when he was a boy, forcing him out of school and into work, and his troubled family life in later years. I was also pleased to see that time was spent talking about some of his ""lesser known"" works which are still fantastic books.My only complaint about this program is really just the limitation of the form. What kind of coverage can you get in 50 minutes? You get a nice overview of Dickens' life but for some depth you have to go to one of the many well-written biographies of the author."
2,Why do scholars have to be so boring??,"I acquired this video to interest my students in Dickens as I was about to assign reading. BIG MISTAKE. This video, while informative (hence the 2 stars), is dry an an old stick. If you use it, use it in small doses--interject your own anecdotes between small stretches of the video. That'll teach me not to preview a tape before I show it."
5,A lot of fun!,"Beautiful film quality, and the interviews with the old roadshowmen, Dave Freidman and Dan Sonney, are hilarious. Ned Beatty is the perfect choice as host/narrator. A lot of fun from beginning to end."
2,A Bland Arlen Treatment,"Harold Arlen is one great composer but with intricate notes and that's a challenge to most singers. Gershwin melodies goes straight as a prairie highway but with Arlen, they have lots of turns and zigzags around them and that's where the risk emerges. Of course, through the years they have become staples that the melody become as common as apple pies. What's left with singers is to improvise over the melodies and maybe that's a reason there are not as many Arlen tributes as there are the Gershwins, Kern and even Weile.Wopat's effort is something unique since he's not really a singer of standards, jazz nor a cabaret crooner by which Arlen usually caters. Wopat's sounds flat on most of the songs but again I'd rather hear so-so singers sing great songs than divas and ""divos"" producing trash and they are legions. It's nice to know a number of them are discovering America's gift to the world - the Great American Songbook!"
1,What a disappointment,I am a fan of Harold Arlen's music and I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Wopat's The Still of the Night so I was eagerly awaiting this release. What a disappointment! The pointlessly noodling jazz arrangements suck all of the melody and enjoyment out of these glorious tunes. And Wopat's voice is just not suited for some of this material. Avoid this disc and check out The Still of the Night instead.
4,"Not necessarily their worst, but very different.","By the time ""Field Day"" was released in 1988, Dag Nasty was a much different band to say the least. This clearly shows on the album; the band by this time boasted only one original member (Brian Baker), and a much different sound than on previous efforts. On first listen, one might be tempted to dismiss ""Field Day"" as perhaps their worst album (as I did, I must admit), but such assertions ignore the fact that this is simply a whole different album. ""Field Day"" boasts not so much an emo sound, but rather (and dare I say) a blues-rock/metal sound, as is evident on songs like ""13 Seconds Under Water"" and ""Dear Mrs. Touma"". ""Field Day"" also boasts a remake of the Dag Nasty classic ""Under Your Influence"", which is another example of the more hard rock sound that Dag Nasty had developed for themselves. All in all, just a solid rock album.Would I recommend this to anyone just getting into DN, though? Not likely."
5,HOT!!!!,"Great stuff. It's about time. Good old boy Western stuff. With an easy on the eyes sheriff!!! Great plot, very realistric."
5,Sherlock Holmes in Wyoming,"The reference to Sherlock Holmes is revealing, the way the charater of Longmire is written has the characteristics of Holmes. There is also the Shakespearean aspect of ""As You Like It"", this show covers the gamut of audiences in the stories and characters.I've not regularly watched television since the original Star Trek went off syndication. This program may cause me to buy another television; well written, well acted, well portrayed."
4,Too Short a Season,"Season was pretty good with some very cool characters. The ten episodes were not good enough for the money though, Gotta have 12 or more it seems to me."
1,Warning! This looks like the cheapest of DVD releases coming soon...,"Why I gave this release a 1 star review, and would give it a zero star review if it were possible.These 10 episodes were shot in HD widescreen.What is A&E; / Warner Brothers Home Video giving us?Two DVD flipper discs (discs that have the program on both sides of the discs).Why don't you just give us DVD-R burned discs instead if this crap?Excellent show - but no sale here until A&E; or Warner Brothers give us a simple blu-ray release,oh, and guess what, it doesn't even need to be remastered or anything for the blu-ray format since the show is only a year old!Warner Brothers idiot department strikes again."
3,Not like the book at all.....,"If you are expecting this series to be like the book you, like me, will be sadly disappointed!! At first I hated it and I was super outraged at the story lines, the characters, etc. Then, I got to ""sort of"" like it. I do have to say that the woman that is playing under sheriff ""Vic"" is a HORRID choice! She is nothing like the character in the book. First of all she is blonde and her personality is nothing like the Vic in the book. I honestly hope it gets cancelled. Why would Craig Johnson go along with this?"
4,Creative today's western,The setting is the right part of the country for a good western yarn. Good 'message' and the characters and actors are true to life.
5,Modern Classic,"Beautifully crafted and perfectly cast. Taylor embodies the quintessential and well-loved western archetype seamlessly. Nearing the level of Wayne and Eastwood with a portrayal that is anything but mimicry. He is constantly, with every nod and tip of the hat, molding a character that is exquisitely nuanced. It's endlessly entertaining just to watch him work. Katee Sackhoff's performances in this series are also worthy of note. She evinces a cougar-like physicality and tempers it with a convincing patina of femininity. She cleans up nicely but will kick your ass if necessary. There are myriad tough-chick characters these days but few pass the laugh test. No test required with this one. Her character, Vic, is the perfect foil for Longmire and Sackhoff has acting chops to spare. If you like Westerns this is a ""can't miss"". If you don't, this might change your mind."
4,Super show.,"Longmire was reccommended to us by a friend. It started out pretty slow, and I was skeptical about the acting, but it has really picked up the last of the 1st season. Some actors you will recognize. You should definately give it a try."
5,good movie,My husband and I enjoyed the show very much. It is a desent movie for the whole family. I just hope it continues to be that way. The scenery is beautiful too.
4,"Good, but somewhat depressing","Like mysteries and thought I would try this one after reading reviews. I enjoyed reading it, but at the same time am not sure whether to get more in the series. Found the end kind of sad. Don't let this review put you off. Give it a try for yourself."
4,Longmire is a Man's Man,"Excellent scenery. Robert Taylor makes the show with his mature, calm, western law enforcement style. We streamed the program and watched the season in a week."
4,Longmire: The Complete First Season,"I like it very much . It has great characters and a good running plot (story) for me. When education and rookies work with wisdom ,experience,and age the outcome is usually surprising and exciting."
5,Great,This to me is one of the best shows on TV right now so many turns and twist Some of the ends are never what you think that they will be . good cast for sure.
3,Wyoming who done it,"Here's a guy that has emotional issues. He can't seem to grow. He alienates his daughter an his best friend, simply because his unwillingness to be honest with himself and them.The murder mystery story line is always interesting ."
1,Nice scenery,"I really didn't enjoy this show much. The scenery is beautiful, but the first episode pretty much scared me off of this show. I would think they had fact-checkers or editors for some of the plot points, but they were missing in action."
2,Mired in mediocrity,"Didn't you loveNo Country For Old Men? The story. The characters. It was all so nuanced and unpredictable. So violent and yet so humane. Awesome film.This isn't that.Of course No Country For Old Men was a movie and this is a TV series. And Robert Taylor is no Tommy Lee Jones. But c'mon guys, Longmire feels like the missing season of Walker, Texas Ranger. Generic biker gangs. Stupid bar fights. Stoic Native Americans. I suggest the producers subscribe to a few seasons of HBO to see how much more sophisticated TV has become in 15 years."
4,Interesting show,"I almost didn't buy the season because of the pilot, but I am a fan of the Longmire books so I went ahead anyway. The other episodes were all very well done. The plot moved along well and usually made sense and the character development became excellent. They are not as good as the books, but well worth watching. I am looking forward to seeing season 2."
5,Based on a great series of mysteries by Craig Johnson,This tv series is so good - the acting and writing edgy with some dry Wyoming wit always there. Read the books this show is based on: Walt Longmire series by Craig Johnson. They're fantastic !
5,The Modern West closely covered !,"An excellent show that follows the actual books very consistantly. It is good to see two of my favorite actors back on the screen in Lou Diamond Phillips and Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica). She is perfect for her part here as the Sherriff's frisky and often irreverant but faithful friend and deputy. Lou does an awesome job also as Longmire's long time friend and owner of the Red Pony, the local watering hole. Exciting and yet down to earth,just as the west's less populated states really are. I hope this series lives through many seasons to come!"
5,Great show!,"My wife and I really enjoyed this show. We love these murder mystery type shows, and this one was special. We could never figure out the ending and usually we can on shows like this."
2,"5 Stars for Location, 0 (Big Fat ZERO) for viewing quality.",Not worth the price. Very bad quality picture. Music is okay.
3,america,"This video is a corporate tragedy and what is wrong with this great country now. Greed. Take profoundly beautiful scenery - fly overs of some of the most luscious natural environs we have, coupled with gorgeous, cheerful music and record it on video tape. Video tape cannot be restored to digital as well as can film, because film contains much more information then video tape. So to save a few bucks, the corporation decided to pop for video tape but not film. This means that forever, this visual and audio masterpiece will never be able to be transferred to digital with any degree of high definition, and that, in my opinion is a tragedy."
1,Disappointing,I originally bought the VHS for this years ago and it was beautiful. Wonderful music and video.It's a shame that in a world of such advance audio/video technology no one bother to actually re-issue this in true digital HD form. I do better videos from my old camera into DVD with my Mac.
2,Looks like a garish transfer from VCR tape,"The original photography must have been stunning, and the ""image with the shadows"" technique is very kewl, but I kept straining to see what must have been the original quality. Dang, I really wanted to enjoy it. I tossed it out after ten minutes."
5,"An excellent novel with well drawn characters,surprise end.","This novel has characters that are very realistic, even uncomfortably so! It is skillfully put together on many levels. An unanticipated climax. Accurate descriptions of geographic locals give the novel a feel of being there. Highly recommended for anyone. A really great read!"
3,"it's errr, ok","I really liked Babe the blue ox. I heard 'box' a few years back and i thought that it was excellent, i was excited to find out that 'box'was not the full extent of their recorded output so when i found this CD in a second hand shop i immediateley bought it (the fact that it was in a second hand shop should give you some indication of it's quality). It does have some good songs on it, but it is (to be honest) - a bit of a mess. If you are new to babe buy 'box', but this is for die-hards only rather than the casual babe fan."
5,Great Book for Beginners and Advanced,"I work in the field of marketing and have dabbled with Photoshop for a while. I now find myself using it more and more since getting this book. I like that the book breaks things down and makes the program easy for the user to understand yet isnt't so simplistic an avid user would get bored. One of my favorite features of the book is the center section; here there are color photos of color swatches, different blending techniques, layering effects, etc. I refer to this section often, rather than choosing each effect on the menu bar and undoing until I find what I'm looking for. This book has a permanent spot within arms reach of my computer."
3,Not for the longtime user,"I've used Outlook for a long time, altho' I don't consider myself a power user. I picked this up to see what I was missing and did not find much I didn't already know. A couple of things that looked useful didn't seem to show up in the same way on my screen. Don't know if the version has changed or the fact that I mainly use Web Outlook these days is the problem.This would be a good reference for the new user, unless the problems I encountered showed up."
5,Dummies are the Smartest Again,As usual the Dummie's books make learning easy and fun. This book tells you everything you need to know in an simple to follow format and covers all the important information. Outlook 2007 for Dummies is the one and only book you need to get the most out of your MS Outlook.
2,Too complicated to be useful,"I loved Keli Roberts' earlier videos for step aerobics and I was hoping this video would also be fun and challenging. It turned out to be challenging alright, but too complicated to hook my interest long enough to stick with it. What I don't need is an exercise in frustration. This video is strictly for step aerobic junkies who know their way around the step with their eyes closed."
1,confusion,"I liked Kelly Roberts when she first came out with her step and weights vhs. This one is too much information in a little amount of time to follow. There is no review and therefore confusion is hard to follow.I can do all the moves and I can lift all the weights, but the sequences on the step are too fast and furious.Is it possible to get a suggestion for a different CD? Can I exchange the one I have now?Thank you for your understanding.Slava"
3,tough,Kelly Roberts is great but in this workout she is very hard to keep up with because she gives little direction on the steps shes doing. This is not for a first-time step user. Will probally take a few times before you get the routine.
4,Keli is definitely my favorite instructor,"I have yet to be disappointed with a Keli Roberts workout. Ever since discovering her on Cher Fitness, I have sought out her best videos and Step it Strong is a great one. Keli mixes step with strength training and weights for an all-over workout. I appreciate her little attempts to be funny and encouraging. I really appreciate that she is one of the better aerobics instructors at cueing, in my opinion. She has an overall attitude and persona that I find very personable and encouraging. Denise Austin drives me crazy, but Keli Roberts makes me enjoy my workout."
1,you must be kidding,"I purchased this tape after reading some reviews.What a mistake,I threw it in the garbage.Ms. Welch is on a tredmill,with 2 others doing aerobics,either jumping in place or running up & down steps.Stick to Jane Fonda,at least you will moving around."
5,Quick Delivery,"I received this dvd quickly, and it is in great shape. I would not hesitate to order from this company again."
3,"Very short, very early Quo.","Contains three tracks:- Are You Growing Tired..., Technicolour Dreams, and Spinning Wheel Blues. - from German TV 1968~9, totaling about nine minutes. The B&W / colour picture quality is fine; although the sound is 5.1 DD / DTS, it is remixed / enhanced from mono sources.The disc also contains twelve minutes of previews for other discs in this series; and a DVD Jukebox featuring ten live performances from various artists' live dvd's"
4,Good Starter Kit,"Just getting into modeling, these were a good starter. These were a fair value.I am finding that I really like Squadron products."
5,LOVE,"It's so hard to find age appropriate activities for 2 year olds, so I was super excited about this book.So far it's toddler approved. =)"
2,Smells Bad,"After taking off the plastic-wrapped, I could tell this was a used book in someone's chemistry lab. It stunk like formaldehyde and other chemicals, and questionable particulates were always released into the air any time I closed the book."
1,WAY dated!!!,"Soldier of Fortune: First published in mid-80s, and attitudes toward sexuality VERY outdated.(She is an adult professional living in Chicago (with no past traumas/issues) and she has never even gone to second base???)The heroine is supposed to be (simultaneously) way into a merc TV show, but totally unaware of any of the weapons used?She is also completely naive about her body/sexuality (and she grew up on a ranch???) -- so naive as to belong to another century. She does not have the attitude of a modern woman who has chosen to be picky about when to share her body with someone; she has the a-sexuality of the forced, complete ignorance of aristocratic female children from Georgian England.Also, characters not consistent in the attitudes/development of feeling towards each other or about themselves. Result is that entire relationship is superficial-- boring...."
3,No more DIC episodes!,"All this DVD features shows from the DIC era of the Care Bears. The animation wasn't that great while the stories were decent.Episodes include:The Last Laugh, The Show Must Go On, Mayor for a Day, Soap Box Derby, The Girl Who Cried Wolf, Forest of Misfortune and Concrete Rain.Note: Loyal Heart Dog is featured more in these episodes than the later episodes. In fact he doesn't even speak in the later ones.Please note that some of these WERE released on video in a limited released. I think it was the same company that released some of the Muppet Babies long lost videos from 1984-1987. When Nelvana took over the series and released videos, everyone forgot about these.I'm going to wait on the Nelvana episodes to come before buying this DVD."
5,Definitely for little kids,"I was 14 when the Care Bears came out. These episodes from the original TV series are exactly how I remember them - trite, sentimental and badly animated (think Thundercats). I bought this DVD for my son, who was 3 at the time, and he was absolutely glued to them. This DVD and the Bedtime stories DVD are definitely the better buy when compared to the newer 3-episode DVDs (Tenderheart Tales & Land of Enchantment, and overlap significantly (only one different episode on the 3-episode DVDs)."
1,Big let down,"This movie was a big let down to me.As a giant fan of the Carebears, I had bought the original 2 Carebears movies, as well as some of the VHS tapes that come with the stuffed animals not too long ago.Seeing this dvd in the store, I was thrilled to find another Carebear movie and of course bought it right away, along with the Bedtime Story dvd.They were both a horrible disappointment to me though, and if I could I would have taken them back and gotten my money back! It didnt match up at all to the original Carebears movies and show, and several of the voices were quite awful! Nothing at all compared to the originals!Original Carebears fans will not like this dvd at all.My advice.... do not waste your money on any of the 3 dvd's in this set!"
4,Childhood memories relived!,"I love the fact that the cartoons on this tape are the exact ones shown on television from the 1980's. I grew up with the Care Bears and am very excited about their return. Now I can relive my childhood all over again by having my daughter grow up with them too. My daughter, who is 15 months old, will actually sit down and watch this tape with me. She doesn't ever sit still for anything!If you grew up with the Care Bears and are a huge fan of them, then I highly recommend buying this tape. You will not be disappointed."
3,it was ok,"I wanted this dvd to be more explanatory on how to advance in postures in general, and it didnt really seem to do that for me. It was really just a couple of series that biuld up to two or three advanced postures. It would help with these as far as understanding preliminary stretching though. It was really just ok."
3,Ink Cartridge Alert,"This is really about the ink cartrige needed for this printer. Under the Product Description for the HP 97 ink cartridge, it states that the cartridge is good for over 400 pictures; it's not, it's good for between 90 and 150 pictures. After much discussion with HP, they finally told me that it's only rated for about 150 color pictures. You'll be going through a lot of ink cartridges if you have a lot of photos (vacation pictures) to print like I did, and they're not cheap. I appreciate Amazon's feedback when I'm purchasing products, so I thought I should share. The printer itself is great though."
4,HP Photosmart A716 may be better but 475 is great too,I can only comment on the HP Photosmart A716 which I own. I love the 4gb of storage and the ability to edit pictures. The 475 only has 1.5 gb of storage. I am sure the 475 prints quality pictures as well. The reason why I think A716 may be better than 475 is that it has more internal memory to store photos and it is cheaper on Amazon. Just compare the two before you buy. You may get more with the A716 at a cheaper price.
5,Great product,"We are very happy with this HP Photosmart compact printer!Easy to use, great quality pictures and portable.A++ for this product."
1,Don't Do It!,"I bought this printer when it originally came out. I don't print every shot I take, so it took me 6 months to print 11 shots. That was it. An error message came on...not even their ""tech"" folks could help. Their fix? Take it to a local authorized repair dealer. At my cost. I already paid way more for this thing than it was worth. NEVER NEVER buy an HP printer. Is this a single incident? Go ahead, buy one and see how long it will last."
1,Regional Coding,"I cannot recommend HP to anybody anymore. The company introduced regional coding, which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another. For most this is probably not an issue, for those busily traveling around it is. Also, it is an issue of principle, its bad enough for DVD, but printer cartridges? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude. I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75, almost 50% of my printer (my sixth and last HP). Don't buy HP."
4,Fun like Pokemon,"If you like a game with zombie skeletons and amother story of a mom being dead this is for you, Is it just me or in every danm story for kids the mom has to die. Jeez anyway have fun drilling everything you ever wanted to drill like statues and policemen and robots."
4,The Drill of the Chase,"Do you like Pokemon? Well this isn't it, but it's made by the same guys who made it. As a young thief trying to recover a magic diamond, you use your drill-tipped tank (controlled by the GBA/DS' shoulder buttons) to literally plow through doors, walls, furniture and pretty much everything else. But you'll also have to solve puzzles and scale up platforms with your Drill Dozer while collecting microchips and gears to make it stronger. And the cartridge's built-in rumble pack increases the sensation of tearing your foes a new one. Now I can look past the 6 levels of the game, and the repetitive music, and even the trigger-finger strain! But it makes no sense whatsoever to have to pay in chips to continue if you lose! Even if you don't pony up you still pick up where you left off, making this a pointless detriment to an otherwise amusingly unique game.This game is rated E for Everyone: Violence."
5,Best GBA game of 2006!,"This is the first new game from Game Freak in years. Most people probably know them as the creators of this other little franchise, POKEMON. Drill Dozer is an absolute gameplay delight, and the art and story are really charming.The basic hook of the game is its heavy use of the L & R buttons. R turns your drill on, and L turns the drill on backwards. The kicker though, is they use the drill for EVERYTHING. Fly through threaded tunnels, kick backwards out of blocks, hang from platforms, open doors, fight bad guys, fly and swim with a propeller attachment, and smash through walls, desks, chairs, lamps, blocks, crates, ceilings, floors, cars...Every couple levels they throw something brand new at you, and there is decent replay value in upgrading your drill bit to access secret areas, as well as collecting chips to spend in the store.Next to Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents this is the must play GBA game of 2006 no matter what age you are!"
1,Disappointing and Painful to read,"This book was a huge disappointment so many things that just didn't make sense, that I was very irritated. And it was so predictable. I was practically saying the lines before I read them. Don't waste your time."
1,a rung below Koontz,"Reviews aren't usually my thing, but I feel like I had to offer a warning to others who might also be moved to buy this book. I bought the book on impulse, based on the glowing reviews by a number of people. I made it about five pages the first night... and another 12 tonight before giving up. There may even be a good story there, but I just couldn't get past the lame, cliched, clunky writing. Full disclosure: I don't read much popular fiction, but do enjoy writers like Stephen King, Tim Powers and Chris Moriarty."
4,Great read,"I truely enjoyed reading this book. I could hardly put it down, finished in 2 sittings. I was not expecting this story to be a twist on Jesus's time, it was a pleasant suprise."
2,Are the High Reviews Just from Christian Fiction Fans?,"I wanted to like this book; I really did. First of all, I'm a sucker for time travel books. Second, I teach high school theology, so the idea of going back in time to meet Jesus thrills me.This book, alas, did not. I found the characters flat and stereotypical (e.g. the anti-Christian scientist embittered by the murder of his missionary wife), and the writing is just pure action without much texture. The plot is somewhat interesting, and I did, grudgingly, finish the book to see what happened, but I didn't much enjoy myself along the way.This is just very much like so many other works of Christian fiction: If Christ weren't a character in it, it wouldn't get published."
5,"Amazing, the next Michael Crichton","This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride back in time to explore the inner depths of the Christian faith to its core belief in the ressurection of Christ. The Author mezmorizes you right from the start with ideas so profound yet securely rooted in scientic theory that one can truely believe they are traveling through time to witness histories greatest moment ever, the dawning of a new age, after the death of Christ. But what happens after that... you'll have to read the book for yourself. Does Christ really rise? Or has it been one of the most elaborate hoaxes the world has ever seen? This is the journey of Didymus... Do you believe?"
2,"Grammar, Viewpoint & More, Oh My!","I have to agree with the review written by K.E. Kroeger. And in case anyone thinks that Kroeger's review is tainted by his atheism, I'm here to say that I am an enthusiastic and devout Christian. I'm no English teacher but I am a struggling writer. In all honesty, Jeremy's awkward handling of grammar and viewpoint renders this book nearly impossible to read and enjoy. I absolutely love his (high-concept) story idea, but why didn't he have the time and the energy to seek real publication, which would in turn provide real editing?Jeremy, I'm giving this book my best shot, but I wish you'd at least have found someone to critique this book in a professional manner before you released it to be read by the reading public. Your excellent topic deserved it."
4,The D experience,I was enthralled by this book. It is a story which made me keep reading until I had to go to bed. The plot moves very quickly I read it in two days.Thoroughly enjoyed the book.It is simple but profound in scope.
5,Robinson Rocks,I have never read a book of his that I didn't like. His ideas for story lines are awesome. I will read anything he writes. Also the service from Amazon is excellent. [...]
2,"Excellent Premise, Terrible Execution","This story is built around a great premise. It lingers around an original and interesting concept of time travel. It also lacks imagination. Imagine a 14 year old punk kid that skips class, listens to devil rock, and steals his mom's cigarettes paraphrasing the Bible. That is the gist of this book. The approach to the material can only be described as immature.This is a book about Biblical times and the author sidesteps the story to essential preach to the choir on multiple occasions throughout the book, only to display his ignorance regarding Christian and even American History. When combined with consistent grammatical errors, the book becomes little more than a painful showcase of one man's ignorance and superficiality."
4,"A Classic Bait & Switch, But I Was Hooked","Yet again I buy a book expecting a nice little sci-fi time travel read only to find there is something else going on, in this case Christianity. And yet, I could not put this down, as the story was compelling enough to overcome the underlying proselytising.Yes, this is a book that I figured out right quick was working towards proving the myth of Jesus, but frankly the story was good enough that I didn't care. The science was great, the characters somewhat compelling and the historical details mighty interesting.It was a good enough read that I would have given it 5 stars except Jeremy Robinson lost me at the end with ridiculous Noah's Ark scenario.Still, all in all, a fun weekend book."
1,Silly book,"I bought this book because of the favorable reviews and was really disappointed. Jesus is just too cool,the love story is banal, the characters undeveloped and one-dimensional,the style and grammar amateurish and the ""time travel"" theme has been done better.Really-- don't buy this book."
2,Comic book-like,"I was so disappointed; it could have been so good. An interesting premise, about two time travelers from 2005 going back to walk and talk with Jesus Christ. But it was so badly written (misspellings and bad grammar) it was hard to read. I am very surprised that it made it to print with so many typos in it, e.g., ""he wretched into the grass with force,"" ""the man who lied on the ground,"" ""the Yankee fan whom had already taken aim,"" ""his eyebrows raised into his forehead."" And this is all in the first 50 pages. Plus the plot was somewhat corny. It read like a comic (there were a lot of `Pangs' and `Whacks' and `Arghs') not to mention stuff like hospital charts hanging at the foot of the bed (they haven't done that in 50 years!). The whole time travel thing befuddled me so I didn't even try to keep track of how and when people went and came back. And the ending was rather lame. I thought Tom's reaction at the end was out of character, but just a nice expected wrap-up to the story."
2,i was disappointed,"frankly, after reading all the positive reviews, i was very disappointed in this book. the character development was weak. while the concept of the basic story was quite unique (time travel to biblical times) the discussion around the technology and enigmas generated by visiting the past were poorly described. i also got the impression that this book was a pro-christian piece of work much as the Left Behind series is. i have never written a book review here before but i was motivated to do so after being let down by this book."
2,Proofreading should be obligatory!,"The plot is average, although the basic idea is quite good!I found the character development too shallow!BUT, the biggest problem of this book is the number of typos!It really becomes annoying even for a non-native English speakeras I am! The editor tried to make some savings here!I guess there other better edited/printed books around withequally good stories! Would not really reccomend it!"
1,Religious propaganda,"I'm a big fan of techno thrillers and was looking forward to reading what looked like an interesting challenge to the bible's stories via time travel technology and the associated paradoxes. But this was a weak plot which essentially retold the bible's stories from the perspectives of 2 characters from present day - one a doubter and one a believer. The good guys are perfect, Jesus is portrayed as a cool guy who doesn't get perturbed by anything, the disciples are loyal and strong - I kept waiting for a twist but it never happened. I wouldn't have been surprised to see an invitation to join up to a church at the end of the book, it was that bad. I have read others by the same author which were at least half-decent but this was so bad I had to write this review (my first on Amazon)."
1,The Didymus Contingency,"When I first read about this book I perceived it to have a very intriguing premise.The plot line described in the promo seemed thought provoking, intellectual and philosophical. It turned out to be the most ridiculous and far fetched take on religion and the nature of god that I've ever stumbled across.The only thing more laughable than the the beginning and the middle, was the ending. This book wasn't necessarily offensive to believers or non-believers, it was just plain stupid. God could have been on hiatus from an episode of ""Family Guy."""
4,"Another good premise with a good, but not overly great story","I absolutely loved the premise of this book as soon as I read it. The ending was suberb and the writing was mostly flawless. My only complaint is it did get repetitive at times. I would reccommend it with the caution that it starts to slow down towards the middle a bit, but blows you away by the end."
5,A Must Read - Great Book!,"I'm a huge science fiction fan, and I particularly enjoy stories with time travel themes. I'm also a committed Christian. I've long felt that there's a lack of quality Christian fiction, and there's almost no Christian science fiction. I can understand the difficulty in creating a sci-fi/Christian story line, but Jeremy Robinson accomplished it. The Didymus Contingency is one of the very few spiritually oriented fiction books that I've thoroughly enjoyed.I couldn't put this book down. It was a great read on many levels. The science fiction angle was compelling. The characters were well developed and the story was creative and entertaining. At the same time I felt uplifted spiritually. What else can you ask for! I can strongly recommend this book!"
2,Promises a lot delivers so so,"I was looking for another off shoot of The Da Vinci Code, so perhaps this is why this book was so disappointing. The writing for me was too bland. Robinson could have taken the theme and run away with it. Unfortunately, all he did was walk. A ""nice"" read, but nothing extraordinary."
1,The best thing you can say about this book is - it's a book..,"This book is CHRISTIAN FICTION. I was given a copy by someone who did not realize this, but I read it anyway. To be honest, even though I am an atheist I did not find myself completely disgusted by this book, just BORED. If you've ever read The New Testament, nothing in this book will be new to you. The only part of this book that completely disgusted me were pages 256-257 where the author proselytizes about how there would be no America if there had been no Jesus Christ because we all know America was founded by Christians. Ben Franklin would probably barf, and the pages were completely irrelevant to the story. Anyway - I suggest you read this book only if you have never had an independent thought in your life, are not familiar with good science fiction or quality literature, or like me are addicted to reading and it is the only book in a 5 mile radius you haven't read and you are desperate for a fix."
1,"Attempt at a Techno-Thriller, but belongs in a Christian Religious store.","I have to admit, some of the action drew me in, but the constant editorial mistakes and religious pandering quickly dimished any sense of intrigue. It seems the entire intention of this book is to convert to Christianity. The book asks where you'd want to go in time given the chance. All we get is Zambia in 1985 and the life and times of Jesus. It is obvious the author knows little at all about the operations and functionality of Quantum Mechanics. Basically, he shrouds the religious 85% of the book with poorly researched science and gunplay as a plot function to hide his intentions. I was displeased with the book and would not recommend it unless you're a bible thumper out to feel good about yourself. I am disheartened to know James Rollins actually recommends this book."
1,No time paradoxes here,"If you like time paradoxes and want to see intelligent resolves around them, this is not the book to read. Also, this is no science fiction whatsoever. It's more like a reinterpretation of a gospel story told in an uninteresting way. Try Asimov's End of Eternity instead for a compelling time paradox story."
2,Its a disappointing Hollywood screenplay,"Its a fast read, its got a good premise but it was so clearly written to be turned into a typical movie. The ""science"" was glossed over, the historical events glossed over, the religious events were glossed over; which leaves you with a science fiction-""y"" action movie.I was disappointed, the author has no voice or opinion to share with the reader. The action and ""plot-twists"" are fun but preictable. There's nothing clever or new here, the one glimmer of hope was the beginnings of a look into Jesus' and the apostles' personalities which the author failed to explore in any depth.Buy it used, take it to the beach for a couple of days and leave it there."
3,"Interesting Premise, Rough Execution, and Religion.","This book was a fair read. Interesting premise, good pacing, but somewhat spoiled by the fact that the writer actually believes the Bible is a record of literal events. It's basically a plot driven, superficial SciFi thriller caked on top of a Christian message. The science, per se, is actually non existant: time travel is simply ""invented"". No details. It's just a premise to get the characters to Biblical times. Still, the religious aspects of the story are thankfully not too preachy. It's a Journeyman quality work: decent plot, but atrocious dialogue (especially Jesus') and some shaky character development. Many of the characters are mere outlines. Even so, the author does manage to give the main characters a modicum of inner lives as they stumble through the unlikely story. It's a light read and if you like Time Travel Tales, worth a grab from the discount bin."
2,"Really cool idea, poorly executed!","This is a book about time travel. I knew that going in, so I'm not complaining about the time travel aspect. The sad thing about this book is that the time travel aspect is more believable than the characters. The characters in this book are so poorly written.Then there's the issue of how the time travelers come across the time machine. That is a challenge in all time travel novels, explaining how such a device is created. Well these guys simply promise themselves that they will invent it in the future and send it back to them in the present. So....wait for it....they get a time machine at the exact time they are expecting it, from the future. LAME!!! And again, if the characters weren't so shallow and cliched, I could have overlooked the time machine aspect.Really cool idea, poorly executed."
3,"Less than what I expected, better than some","I was surprised the tack the author took with this novel. I must admit I found myself unable to decide whether I wanted to throw the book across the room or keep reading. I kept reading and am glad I did. However, clever plot twists and novel usage of time travel and religiosity aside, the book could have been so much more. At times, just when you think the plot is going to be more Crichton-like it becomes more Left Behind-ish and you get hit over the head with blatant proselytizing. If you are able to put this aside as I was and take the story what what it was worth, you'll enjoy this book, 2 1/2 to 3 stars, if not, 1 star"
5,Jesus - The Religious Profet,"Jesus Lived in India allows the reader to understand that GOOD transcends the travels of Jesus while he touches Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Better yet, we understand the similarities and goodness that all religions are focused."
4,For Peace and Love,"So far the whole Trigun series is great. Not a lot of fighting, gun play, no course language,and no sex. This is a great series for young and old. If you love good amine then get this series!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"Along with volume 1, this is my least favorite of the collections. ""Quick Draw"" and ""Murder Machine"" are lightweight romps, entertaining but less interesting than what is to come. This volumw is mostly noteworthy for the introduction of one of the series' most popular characters: gun-slinging priest, Nicholas V. Wolfwood. Entertaining and humorous, with some good charcter interplay."
3,Nice to see old vids,Like the title: It was nice to see some nice old school Icu cube vids but the quality is horrible. For the price I wouldn't recommend this unless you are a hard core fan.
5,ICE CUBE HEATS IT UP!,Since I am one of the many early fans of Ice Cube I have been waiting for this DVD for a LONG time! This DVD gets 5 stars if not more!!! From the early classic videos to the present this DVD is surely one you have to pick up. Can't wait for Volume 2!
3,80's sitcoms,"Just call me a sucker for sitcoms. I'm forever on the internet or in the local stores in search for sitcoms of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Family Ties is one of the chosen selections on my list. It was a favorite then and still is now."
4,Brings Back Memories,Great to some of my favorite 80's TV shows on DVD. There isn't any more family sitcoms on TV now like Growing Pains and Full House.
3,Set contains edited episodes!,"Warning to all Family Ties fans that is buying this set,the set contains edited episodes.What I read is that Family Ties season 1 had some music that Paramount was to cheap to pay for,and so instead of replacing some of the music Paramount decided to delete some scenes from some of the episodes that contain music including a scene from the first episode.I think that's dumb changing the music is one thing but to edit episodes is a bunch of bull,we fans want to buy TV shows on DVD in there uncut form.Yeah go change the music but dont delete scenes.Of course not all the episodes will be edited so that is why I'm still going to buy this set to get the episodes that will be uncut."
3,Good show! So-so boxed set.,"We really enjoyed the show, and it was nice to finally be able to watch some of the old favorites that my husband and I grew up with. The boxed set was a bit disappointing, but liveable.The one thing I absolutely cannot STAND, though, is the abuse of the ""Anti-Piracy"" message slot. On this DVD, it is filled with many, MANY commercials, and you can't skip past them. For that reason, I won't be buying any more of these."
4,Family Ties Season One,"This is a great item to own if you are a Family Ties fan or just love 80s television in general. The only let down is that there are no special DVD features in this edition, but it is still the same great show with all your favorite characters."
4,Could be better,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time, but I wish they had spent a bit more to make it a truly great set. No extras."
1,WHY the price change??????,"I dont understand why the price for this set changed so drastically in the past month? It went from $11.49 to $32.99,now thats a big jump!! I had this set in my saved for later cart, And now i definetly will not buy it for that price... Thats a rip-off for something that came out so long ago and with those cut out scenes. Please lower this price so i can buy this set, I grew up with this show and i would love to have it in my collection.... For a reasonable price."
4,Una buena espera,"Una espera que valió la pena tener, sin embargo, falta alguna referencia de los protagonistas algo así como una edición especial."
4,Interesting Documentary,"It's hard to imagine people living underground, but they do. Look into a world beneath the city streets, where whole communitys exist. Fascinating"
4,Enjoyable romp by Mr. Hubbard.,"If you are a jazz fan this is one of those 'must have' albums that populates so many 'greatest albums' lists. Hub Tones is very enjoyable and very typical of Blue Note's esteemed 1950's and 60's output. ""Prophet Jennings"" and ""Lament For Booker"" are great tunes. Freddie sounds very warm and embracing in the latter especially. The back-up group here is solid as well, giving Freddie a solid foundation upon which to explore.While this album is quite good, I can't quite place it at the highest level of Blue Note recordings. I've listened to it quite a bit since I purchased it and there seems to be something lacking. Don't ask me what that is, I'm not sure, but I can feel it. I still recommend this disc, I just can't lump it in with the best of the best."
3,An Interesting Line-Up and a Fine Bop Recording,"Any album recorded by the Freddie Hubbard quintet with alto saxophonist/flautist James Spaulding is worth owning and not only for the guarantee of fine muscianship. A jazz front line of trumpet and alto sax, not to mention trumpet and flute, is not nearly as common as trumpet and tenor sax (the brothers Adderley, Cannonball & Nat also spring to mind.) Add the brilliant pianist Herbie Hancock and the solid rhythm section of Reggie Workman and Clifford Jarvis and you can't go wrong here. All of the cuts are worth listening to again and again. Particularly beautiful is the sound of Hubbard's trumpet with Spaulding's flute. Trumpet and flute should be heard together more often in jazz! Remastered as part of the Rudy Van Gelder collection this CD features three alternate takes."
5,Enjoy this CD,I've been listening to Ronnie Lane since the early 70s and have always enjoyed his music. This is a very fine album from a very sadly under-appreciated artist.This album is always played in rotation at our parties and it never fails that some guest will demand to know who it is. Beautiful sounds from a greatly missed soul.
5,Ronnie's rough mix of great music with great lyrics,"Of the 20 songs, 15 are written, or co-written, by Ronnie and they are excellent. Music ranges from folksy pop rock, blues, Caribbean, Cajun, bluegrass, and country. Two songs are instrumentals and Ronnie sings the rest with backup from the Slim Chance band. There are fiddles, mandolin, accordion, keyboards, horns, guitar, bass, and drums. The five covers are performed well, but they are not Ronnie's songs, and kind of interrupt the flow. The CD could benefit from re-sequencing. Recommended."
2,Average,"This is not Tony Hillerman's best novel. If you want good suspense and mystery from Hillerman, one of his earlier works would be the best to start out with. The plot here is thin and the suspense never really gets off the ground."
4,Love the insights into Navaho culture & Res,My first Hillerman but not my last. The characterizations were vivid and complex and the story plot line was curious and interesting enough to keep my attention. Loved Chee.
1,Worst novel I have ever read.,"I really don't know why this novel is bestselling.The content is very irritating and ridiculous. Even though I should agree that this novel is a good mixture of a detective novel and a introduction of Navajo culture, why the author used so much negative stuff to introduce Navajo culture? He could have written a happy novel about Navajo. Also everything is kept in suspense till the very end of the story and it turns out that there's no unexpected twist or deep story.Don't waste time, there are so many other novels that worth paying money for. Don't misinterpret that the best selling novel is the best novel."
3,Entertaining,"I have read about 80% of Tony Hillerman's novels dealing with Jim Chee and Lt. Leaphorn and have not come across a bad book yet.I think perhaps my problem here is that was an older novel and I have read many of the newer ones first, so it's like going back in time to view the characters at an earlier date.With this in mind, I think that Tony Hillerman has definently improved over the course of his novels as Coyote Waits, though a good read, is not as evidently mature as his later titles.A few sub plots could have been a bit stronger, but the overall story was entertaining. Read this one in chronological order to the others and you won't be disapointed."
3,Great book but not to the point,"The story drug through the first 3/4 of the book, but when the book finally got to the point it was really interesting.The last chapters were kind of confusing but my reading group figured them out."
2,readers digest of chinese medicine classics,"I have read several translations of classical Chinese medicine texts, and in every instance of reading works by this author, Bob Flaws omits much of the information that is useful and relevant to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. In my readings of his work a few concepts are condensed and reworded and the rest of the text is omitted."
1,What a waste of money,"I was shocked @ the size of this book the minute I saw it. For 15.00 dollars I might as well have gotten me a pizza. I would have lost the same amount of cash. Talking about pocket size. This is truly no joke. Invest your money in anything but this book. Trust me! Translation, what translation. He almost re-wrote a sentence or two. I will never purchase any books by this author, again!"
2,Read It & Own It But Don't Dwell On It Too Often,"I did not really like Mindshadow. I didn't hate it, I merely found it to be an annoying piece of work. Allowing McCoy's relationship with the double-agent to interfere with his friendship was not impossible, merely inappropriate to an old-fashioned Trekkie purist such as myself. The Vulcan-Human hybrid living with Spock's parents, as the flip side of the coin which is Spock's personality, was also quite unthinkable. Sarek would never take such a person into his confidence. Read it for the novelty, but not for a real Trek-experience."
3,A Spock focused Star Trek novel.,Many of the most memorable Star Trek novels focus around a particular character or event. Mindshadow centers on Spocks amnesia and is a collectable for Spock fans.
5,An Epic Document!!,"One of my favorite books of all time. Reminded me of my days drifting around the southwest and Mexico. If it weren't for this book I'd be living somewhere else besides a hotel. If you've ever been homeless, down on your luck or just plain on your own, read this book."
4,Very Interesting,"The book portrays life at the bottom. It surely shows not all of the men are crazy, drug and alcohol abusers. Some of them through the ups and downs in life never choose to go up again, or maybe to try up again. This may have been decided in a purposeful way or possibly life just became to heavy a load to bear, only they know. I was impressed with how many of them were completly content with their life and were willing to live out their days as they were. We should never judge unless we have been there so lets wish them luck and leave them alone."
3,Good but Not Great,"Being a heavy Ranma fan I have to agree with others who that this installment was a let down. Normally I agree and enjoy having a new anime character introduced in the beginning of a series, its usually well sounded. However this Headmaster Kuno was a joke if anything. Its is somewhat funny I give it that but really does give any real involvement to the series. So I wouldn't suggest this video being on the top of a ""to get list"" but rather sometime for a need a new video and don't hvae this one yet."
3,Wierd!,"You learn about the principal (shown on the cover) and he is wierd! He immitates a Hawaiian person all the time and tries to change all the school rules for the worst! He makes the entife student body search for a coconut with a paper in it so that they don't have to get stupid haircuts, and at the end, he threatens to do it all over again! It's not one of the best, in my opinion. But the Ranma 1/2 series is great!"
2,Not enjoyable at all,I really didn't see what this story was written for. It was vert boring and non entertaining one tiny bit.
5,Great for Dancing!!!,"These are all very good songs for dancing. It is very easy to make a choreography from these songs, especially for a folkloric group. There is a lot of fun folkloric music here. There is a modern fusion piece with drums by Isaam (#2). The drums are very beautiful and Isaam is a great drummer. The first song on this CD is one of my favorite songs. It has such a beautiful arrangement. The music is a rich mixture of baladi, saidi, classical and drums. I love number ten also: it is a lovely accordion baladi. This CD also has very nice, interesting music that could be used for tribal-style. Overall, it is a great CD, and I like all of the songs here."
4,Doesn't disappoint,"A must have for dancers, especially if you perform. I didn;t like as much as the first or the fifth, but still good!"
2,Third time -not so lucky,Didnt think this cd was as varied or good as the previous two which is a bit disappointing.
5,"This game is great, despite its lack of length","This was, I must say, agreat game! From the beginning on the Hogwarts Express/Tutorial level you move on t oHogwarts as you weave through the plot of the book. With a whole new inventory of spells, Harry and his friends can do many things. The game was however, too short. I finished it in just 2 days where I expected at least a week. EA really screwed up, they didn't have a practical use of the Marauder's Map, no Firebolt, no Hogsmede, no Quidditch! They really excluded half the book! Where was Crookshanks! Aside from that, they finally go trid of those awful tests before you learn the spells, I hated those. Great game, if you like Harry Potter, I suggest you get the game, if not, get it anyway!"
5,Better and Better,"This game is unlike the others. It is a lot more fun and interesting! You start out in a train where all the students have something to say. You are already battling monsters and exploring the train. After that you start lessons and you get to be all the characters! You do so many things and a lot of it you can do over and over. So buy the game, pleasant encounters await you!"
3,"Not as good, but still worth it!","If you played and loved Harry Potter 1 and 2, you will probably enjoy this game. It is pretty reminiscent of the first two, which is great!What I liked:* I loved the controls! They're the same as 1 and 2, which was great because I was used to those.* All the mini side challenges were fun!* Graphics are mostly amazing!* No running issues.* The new spells. A whole lot of fun!What I didn't like:* No Quidditch.* The game was way too easy! I beat it in two days. 1 and 2 took me months to beat, and I still hadn't quite beaten them when I lost the games.* There is a minor graphics glitch. Not all that big. But still there.All in all, if you hated Quidditch and love to win, then this game will probably be five stars for you!"
2,Okay game,I liked that the game has spells that you actually have to learn but the downside is my computer is too slow for me to play the game to the full extent of it.
4,The easiest of the Harry Potter series games,"No Quiddich in this game...some have complained, but I was glad for the break from it. I found the first two games somewhat hard to complete and lacking in saving opportunites...well, this game is much easier to get through, and saves are much more frequent (in fact too much at the beginning). The hunt for cards is offset by the opportunity to purchase them for Bertie Bots and other assorted treats. The ability to play as each of the 3 major characters is a welcome change...but as you play and come to the final exam for each character, you'll be wondering where the rest of the game is...Lots of great changes here, but it will leave you wishing for more gameplay!"
5,It was Great!,"You can do so much! You can Fly Buckbeet You can play as Ron ,Harry and Hermine And You can Face the Dementors!"
2,Big disappointment,"After buying and enjoying the first two games in this series, we were eagerly anticipating the arrival of the third installment. But, we were very disappointed. Game play was very short. We were able to go through the entire game in about a day.I'd save your money and avoid this game. Hopefully, EA will do a better job with the next version."
5,a really fun Potter game,"I got this game for my birthday. I rented the second game once; it was fun but this game is great! You get to explore Hogwarts (the design of the castle grounds is different from the other game) but you also get to learn new spells. Also you can play as Harry, Ron or Hermione most of the time. Each has special spells. Another thing you get to do is collect wizard cards and collect things for points . The one thing I miss from the old game is you can't charge up your spells to make them more powerful. If you like the Harry Potter books and movies you'll love this game. Buy it ,its worth it."
4,"Very good, but SHORT","This game was very enjoyable. But just like the first guy said, if you haven't read the book, you are left completly in the dark about sirius and peter, pretty much the whole story line. It makes you feel as it was made in a week. if it didnt have the lupin, dementors, or sirius, you wouldnt know it was prizinor of azkaban. No divination class, one short quidditch cut scene, but if you like harry potter, you should at least try it out. It took about a day to finish and beat the game. The last card is so obvious its not even funny. Enjoy the game!"
2,Horribly missed opportunity,"I agree almost completely with the review of darkgenius. Read that review. But darkgenius gave 4 stars while I give only 2. Why? Because it seems that no thought went into the game at all. There is nothing intense. Nothing challenging. Nothing surprising. Nothing to put you on the edge of your seat.The Chamber of Secrets game was infinitely superior, more innovative, longer, more intense, had a real storyline, and had a real climax. This new Prisoner of Azkaban game has none, despite the book's being the best of the series and despite having access to the wonderfully dark and intense new movie.Boo."
3,I beat this game in a day!!,"This game is really fun, but the fun it very short which was suprising as the game was almost a gigabyte. I would wait until the price comes down a bit before checking out some of EAs' lesser work."
4,best of all Harry Poter and Ea games is this,"This game very mush fun filled.There are many spells.But the game is small.Even if it is small I like it becauese this game is not so easy after all there are so many thing to collect.I finished the first-two games very fast but it took me months the finish the game and also find all the wizard cards.Quidditch is not there in the game because Ea Games also made a game on in which u can be a beater,Chaser,Keeper and Seeker.Thsi is also availible on Amazon and this games name is Harry Potter-Quidditch World Cup.There is a problam in the game and thatis u can choose the characters u want."
5,They did Lupin justice!,I had the game before but then I lost my copy so I bought another copy on Amazon. The graphics are great for 2004. The voice overs are good and Professor Lupin was done Justice in this game on his appearance.
4,Could have been better,"This game is awesome! It has spectacular graphics and exciting gameplay! Shame you can't play any Qudditch though, its only a cutscene. And one more thing, the game is too short! I think this game is almost half as long as the other 2 games; like the other reviers have said.But overall, I think its still great! I would recommend this game to any Harry Potter fan or played the first 2 games."
4,the best game ever,I THINK IT WILL BE THE BEST GAME TO COME OUT THATS HARRY POTTER AND THEY SHOULD MAKE VERRY LOW PRICES SO KIDS COULD PLAY IT SO THEY KNOW HOW THE MOVIE IS CAUSE IF THE GAME IS GOOD I CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE . I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE AN AWESOME GAME. I HAVE THE OTHER HARRY POTTER VIDEO GAMES AND I LOVE TO PLAY THEM AND SO I WILL LOVE TO PLAY THIS ONE
4,the firebolt,Harry gets the firebolt at christmas the firebolt is the fastest broomstick in the wizarding world It probblay goes 50-200 MPH that would be really fast and the nimbus 2001 I think goes 40-100 MPH the nimbus 2001 can't stop the firebolt IT would look like a joke next to the firebolt in the 3rd game ther firebolt is going to be fast in the quidditch match aginst slytherin you may be able to fly the firebolt around the castle grounds like you can do whith the hippogriff the best part of the game will be the firebolt I am a relly big harry potter fan I bet I will enjoy the game I think It will be awsome bye for now peace out bye
1,Forget the game - read the book!,"So there is soooo many other cool item that EA could have included in this video game to make it even more fun, but no. Only 3 levels really of challenges and 3 final exams. It's cool to go around finding the cards and secret password but other than that, they didn't do much of anything other than really really nice graphics. If you like the two previous games, you'll be sad by this game."
2,Waste of Money,"PROS--Fun to find Many secret compartments,statues and other hidden things that give you beans to buy collectors cardsCONS--The graphics arnt better than chamber of secrets-Hardly follows the real plot-In spellcasting,(which is most of the game) the computer chooses what spell to use and then all you have to do is click, making the game extremely boring and easy-You can beat the game in a few days and then its not fun to play anymore-Gets extremely boring and you wont want to finish the game anyway-Because of terrible spellcasting, most of the challenging parts are just puzzle-solving. Could be good or bad depending on who you are-If you dont have a near-new computer loading and saving can be VERY slow, and playing can sometimes be choppy"
2,Sorry I wasted my money,"After playing the Chamber of Secrets game I was really looking forward to this one coming out and I think I was one of the first to buy it, but there is no story to it and it is way to short and the challenges are way to simple. I am a 67 year old grandmother and had no trouble finishing the game. It just wasn't fun. I was also annoyed at having three characters running around together. If you haven't played the Chamber of Secrets game, play that and you will see what I mean."
2,Third Game in Series is a BIG disappointment!!,"I had so much fun playing the first two games, Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets. Each one was harder than the first. I was anxiously waiting for the Prisoner of Azkaban to come out!! I could have saved my money. It was a terrible game. Not one trip to Hogsmeade and before you know it, you have completed the game and...nothing. The Bean Room is great and I'm glad they don't have so much flying. I didn't like the inside of the castle either. I will rent the next one before I buy it."
3,Broken tablets,Many of the tablets in the bottle were broken.Better care should be taken in the manufacture of the product and theshipment of the product.
3,Beware if you have a Cherry allergy!,I ordered this for my daughter and tried one to see how the flavor was and found it was overpowering cherry. I called NOW and they confirmed the source of natural flavor is cherry which my daughter has a life threatening allergy to. Hoping I can return to Amazon even though its open. Wish they had listed the source of the natural flavors!
5,they work,"I surprised my doctor when my blood test showed I was no longer deficient in b-12 after I used these for a while. She said that oral supplements usually don't work. One thing though, these are pretty susceptible to breakdown by humidity so if you aren't going to use them up right away if you have any extra moisture absorber packets I'd drop them in."
3,"OK, but...","I mean, it's B12. I don't want to nit pick, cuz I love most of NOW foods products, but these are only meh. They taste kind of bad and they don't melt well. I can get 5000mcg at walmart for a similar price, and they do melt under my tongue and they aren't bad tasting. Maybe a reformulation is due for this one."
2,B-12 Review of NOW Methyl,I'm not really pleased with the NOW Methy B-12 product. I expected to feel some change in energy after taking the product and felt I was taking a sugar pill. I even increased the dosage and still nothing.
5,Cool Stuff,"I'm having some issues with my finger nail getting warped and very heavily ridged. I read that a deficiency in Vit B12 could cause some of that. I guess some of us aren't absorbing it through our intestines like younger people due to IBS or whatever. So I'm giving the b12 lozenges a try.So far, so good. My nails don't look horribly dry and brittle now, but it has only been a few weeks. It will really take more like a couple of months to see if this is doing the trick. The tablets are quiet tasty, very orange. They are small and melt very easily. Cool.On thing to be aware of though, B12 gives you a boost of energy. It isn't anything like caffeine, but if you take it at night you'll not be ready for bed at the normal time. haha"
3,This B12 has sugar in it,"For a product that is designed to dissolve in your mouth, the presence of sugar was disappointing. Some may not mind."
3,Just OK,"As other reviewers have reported, these tablets tend to break down near the end of the bottle. I take just one a day and they are not expensive, so not a huge issue for me. Just make sure to keep the silicone pack in there to absorb moisture."
5,Great Tablecloth!,"This is my first Amazon review. I bought this tablecloth in white about two years ago. I have been so, so happy! I bought it based on postive reviews and it's everything I hoped it would be. Everything washes out nicely and it dries beautifully with no ironing. I've had other polyester tablecloths that were supposed to be wash and iron, but they stained horribly and they were more expensive. This one is very, very difficult to stain. I just had a dinner yesterday and used my $350 Irish cotton tablecloth, which I still love, but spent two hours ironing and starching afterwards. I'm just not willing to do that every time. Today I'm getting this Reflections tablecloth but in a larger size (60 X 120) for larger dinners. I'm also getting the napkins this time since I've seen how well this fabric works and how practical it is."
5,Fits regular size table,"We have a regular/small dining room table, about 5' long and this fits with a good amount of cloth hanging over on all sides - looks kind of like in the picture. Wouldn't get for a table that was any smaller or it would be too big."
3,Very Nice tablecloth,"It's a beautiful table cloth....Unfortunately, I ordered an oblong, the package stated it was an oblong, but the cloth included was a rectangle. I needed it for a special occasion and had no time to return it. So, I now own a rectangular table cloth."
5,Great Tablecloth,"Ordered this as well as the smaller size for my thanksgiving tables. Definitely repels water and stains while still feeling like a heavy, classy table cloth. I highly recommend."
3,Ok Tablecloth,"This table cloth does allow for easy cleanup of liquid spills, however, we noticed a pinkish color bled through onto our light birch colored table after certain bad spills. The pink marks eventually scrubbed out, but we stopped using this on the lighter table and will only use it to cover a darker table we have."
5,Great quality and spill repellent. Great value!,I was surprized at teh quality of this tablecloth for the price. spill repellency is a plus even though I have a plastic cover over it most of the time.
1,Daddy's Girl by Charlotte Vale Allen,"This was one of the dumbest books I ever read. By the time she was 18 years old, she certainly knew what she was doing was wrong."
4,Emotionally Brutal,"I've read most of Charlotte Vale Allen's books, but I'd missed this one, so I finally decided to download it to my Kindle. It's a very honest portrayal of her horrific childhood. She was sexually abused by her father for about ten years. I think anyone who has experienced sexual abuse would benefit from reading this memoir. She doesn't sugarcoat the experience. She honestly shares that the experience has haunted her throughout her life and has caused confusion and pain in later relationships with men. But, she did free herself from her father and managed to come to terms with the experience over many years. There's something about Ms. Allen's writing that appeals to me--I think it's her directness and honesty, along with the ability to tell a good tale. Sadly, this one was based on real-life experience."
3,Sort of entertaining but not much helpful,It's written plainly and you can read easily.But not so helpful to cope with a baby esp. the first one when you know nothing about...
5,Excellent for any sport,"I bought these for my Pee Wee hockey team and they are excellent. They are easier to grab than the ""fatter"" water bottles and easy to squeeze for the smaller kids. Excellent product, excellent price."
3,Guide needs an update,"We took this book with us for a paddling trip in the Florida Keys.The book definitely needs to be updated. We couldn't do some of the day trips we wanted to because the put-in sites listed in the guide were no longer available -- blocked by locked gates.When I ordered the book, I didn't realize that the publication date of the ""all-new guide to sea kayaking trips"" was 2004!Good descriptions of what you might see on each outing -- if you can get out on the water."
5,Best Guide to a Magical Place,"This detailed and thorough guide is obviously the work of an experienced and passionate guide. Bill Keogh covers all the bases, starting with the practical matters - charts and navigation, weather, safety, and equipment. From the coast of Florida all the way to the tip of Key West he lists 67 launch sites for 47 suggested trips. Supplemental information includes a birders list, tidal charts, and contact information for outfitters and guides. The natural history section is wonderfully detailed and reveals the author's great love for this magical place. The best way to see and experience the Florida Keys is on the water, away from the highway and the people. Whether a novice or an experienced kayaker, Keogh will take you there.Marsh Muirhead, author of Key West Explained - a guide for the traveler"
4,Bill Keough is all things paddling in the Keys,"After reading this book my friends and I went down to the Keys and got some kayaks from Bill. Not only was he a real nice guy but he knows just about every inch of good paddling water in the Keys. Detailed descriptions of islands and things like water depth can also help fishermen, A must buy for anyone wanting to do kayaking in the Florida Keys."
5,One of our favorites...find the cat!,"4 (""and three quarters!"") year old Maria and I love this book. It's one of our favorites. The illustrations are great, the rhymes are clever, and there is a cat to find in each picture!"
5,Fun for me and my kids,"After visiting NYC with young kids, we got this book and read and re-read it many times, seeking out the hidden cat and other delights."
1,Not as Described,Medium gray was the same color as dark grey and not what I needed. Expected medium grey to be a lighter shade than dark grey.
2,"Overall, this was not up to Brown's previous efforts","I have read and enjoyed all of Brown's previous books. Warrior Class, however was a disappointment. There were numerous errors in grammar and syntax, so that at times I had to reread a section more than once to decide what he was trying to say. The book is at its best in describing the technical features, though it is reaching the point of incredibility with the jet packs allowing an armored warrior to jump out of a plane at 300mph and land softly. There are numerous gaps in the story, the worst being the one when Thorn switches attitude from trying the run the heroes to ground to tacit support. Where was the conversation between Thorn and McLanahan after the president had his subcu transceiver implanted. It's as thought the book is missing a chapter. I haven't read Wings of Fire yet, but after this bomb, I'll wait for the paperback."
3,"Incredulous, Just Incredulous.","It seems incredulous, to make incredulous remarks about this novel.Although I have noticed from several of his past novels, that this seems to be, without a doubt, Mr Brown's favorite word, it was certainly overused throughout this novel.I still consider him one of my favorite authors, as I anxiously await the arrival of each new book; but I would have gladly waited a little longer for this one, were he to have it reviewed by a better editor.A good read, but far from his best :-("
2,Disappointed,"Seems that everytime I read a book by Dale Brown I vow to never pick up another one. The cover summary on this book was interesting and so I figured I would give Mr. Brown another try. Unfortunately, my initial instincts that have been formed since I read Tin Man were right on. I found the story line to be boring, the execution boring, and the whole experience just one more reminder why I don't like reading Dale Brown."
2,Too verbose,"Plenty of action, plenty of fancy military hardware. Too much of the dialogue is stilted and repetitive. Brown would profit from a good editor."
3,Hey Dale! Where's the beef?,"Okay! I admit it. I'm a technothriller junkie. I like Dale Brown's work, most of it at least.Warrior Class isn't his best work. It was good reading, but it just wasn't a page turner in the ""I don't care if it's 5am...I'm going to finish this book!"" genre. At times, I had to force myself to read. The basic plot premise was believable, even if President Thorn wasn't. Pavel Kazakov, the bad guy, is believable. The hardware is getting less believable as time goes by. I still don't understand Russian.I finally slogged through the book to get to the ending, and I was let down. I kept asking, ""Where's the beef?"" I'll inspect the goods more carefully next time before buying. Now it's off to the store to buy some beef. Three stars. That's it."
2,Warrior Class - Vigilante Fantasy,"Dale Brown's latest journey into his fantasy of the ""good vigilante"" (Warrior Class)is the least interesting of his recent books; the background and tech info is generally interesting but when he starts promoting the idea of ""everyman as arbitor of good and bad"" the book becomes of little interest to anyone over the age of 15 or with an IQ exceeding double digits ... his rant is getting old"
3,"If you've read one, you've read them all","I've read several of Mr. Brown's books, they're all the same with their far out(even impossible, a stealth B-52 is an example of that) gadgets and plots. I guess they're OK if you just want to check your brain at the door and have some mindless fun. Peersonally I'd rather read Tom Clancy or Richard Marcinko and I'm tiring of them too."
2,Where did the Editor(s) go?,"I have been a fan of Dale Brown for years. I have enjoyed each of his previous books and looked forward to his next. Warrior Class, however, left me cold. The writing is disjointed, redundant and rife with poor grammar and inappropriate syntax. This is unfortunate because a pretty good story line really suffers. I find it hard to believe that an editor even scanned this book prior to publication. If one did, he or she should find a new line of work...."
4,"Good, But Not His Best","The book was at it's best during combat missions and conflicts between the President and adminstration. But too much time was spent on developing characters that ended up playing little or no role in the books conclusion. While it wasn't the type of book I've come to expect from Dale Brown (i.e. reading into the early morning hours), it was still quite good and I look forward to his next book due to the interesting presidential scenario he has created."
2,Jumping Beans,"Here is a book that literally jumps all over the place, from the White House, to Russia, the Ukraine, Macedonia, the air, the ground, etc. Poor plot! I felt Dale was trying to impress me with his knowledge of flying. I didn't need all the technical jargon about weapon systems, flight characteristics, types of weapons employed over and over again. I had trouble finishing the book and promptly gave it away when I was finished. It won't make my library."
2,Implausible,"This was my first (and last) Dale Brown book. While I expected this book to be a bit 'out there' (and it was), about halfway through the book Brown decided it was time to invent ridiculous gadgets to go along with the ridiculous plots. My favorites included 'sausage-sized supersonic projectiles' that manage to plow through the entire sea all the way to the bottom where somehow they continue to plow 300 feet into the sea floor, and rocket-shoes that allow people to jump out of aircrafts. After that, the unscratchable bulletproof armor and the shoulder fired lightning blots seemed downright plausible."
5,The Weight,"Listen to the guest appearances>>> El Da Sansai, Dilated, Craig G, Will Pack, Phil da Agony, Consequence, Out Da Ville, Mike Zoot, Blackstar, Tribel, F.T., Lootpack, Shawn P., Mighty Mi, Marley Marl, Masta Ace, Plus One, to name a few. Underground has expanded to the UK and the rest of the world is catching on too. This album is a tight collaboration of the illest beats and rhymes."
3,"Good, but too choppy","I enjoy many of the tracks on this album, in particular, the blackstar joints, along with the contributions of lootpack, phil da agony, and evidence. They are all solid songs with great beats. The only detail of this album that I don't like (or particularly understand) is the fact that every other song is an interlude. It kills the the continuity and hurts the project as a whole. A solid effort by the creators, but could have been excellent if the filler was excluded."
3,Not really worth the wait,"I really wanted this to work - after all, there aren't enough UK producers coming with real quality beats - but while I wanted to love it, in the end ""The Weight"" just left me disappointed. The beats hit hard, some of the MCs contributing I have a lot of time for (Mos Def and Twali Kweli, Mad Lib and the Lootpack MCs in particular) and the whole package is polished, but it just doesn't do it. Maybe it's the fact that for the first 12 tracks or so, the continuity is broken by answerphone messages, or perhaps that, by using some many MCs, there's no coherent feel to the album. The occasional track (The Hard Margin, Kronkite) blows up, but too much just feels tired and bland."
2,Not Heavy Enough,"The Weight seems to be an increbible collaboration of some of the greatest faces in hip hop today. What you have in the end is an album that lacks momentum. Every time its just about to get itself off the ground, it runs out of gas. There are a few redeeming tracks on this album. Props go to Craig G for ""That's my Word"" (track 6)a groovy melow tune that flows from start to finish."
5,you got buy this,"the creators album is well produce. it has some of the best underground mcs on this album. like for ex: mos def & talib kweli lootpack, phil da agony and many more mcs. i truly recomend all the true hip hop heads to go out an rock this album"
3,"Stuck pixels aside, a beautiful 20"" widescreen.","This monitor has an incredible picture, though the darks do suffer from lack of detail sometimes. Perfect for gaming, office work, programming, maybe not so much for hi-def movies.My biggest complaint -- I returned one monitor because it had 3 ""stuck"" pixels, all of them near the middle of the screen, permanently blue. The second one has one stuck pixel (also blue... problem?) closer to the bottom-left.With a black screen, the picture glows a little brighter towards the top.I really wish this monitor came with no stuck pixels. It's easily a 4.5/5.0 for the price if this stuck pixel ever fixes itself. I'd rather the pixel be dead (permanently black) than stuck one color, as you hardly notice dead ones."
1,Poor value,"A stand that can't hold the weight of the screen (poor adjustment range even if it could), three stuck pixels, uneven brightness on a dark screen. Poor value at any price. I wouldn't buy a Samsung product again, despite their great looks."
1,Worthless,"I am very computer literate and techno-savy, i.e. I know how to build a computer, install drivers, etc . . . Out of the box the monitor does not work. Who needs this kind of aggrivation."
1,How do I get a replacement stand,"I have the same issue as everyone else with this stand. Mines is out of manufactures warranty, but I called Samsung opened a service ticket and they refuse to replace it. Any ideas on the right people of talk with at Samsung about this? Thanks"
2,Defective Stand/Support Hinge,"To echo the comments made by the last couple reviewers. The LCD Monitor started to tilt way from the stand and within the last week, decided to give way and has peeled away from it's support hinge on the stand. While the LCD Monitor itself is pretty good, i can't give any more than 2 stars given this issue."
2,Stand has a major defect,"I bought this monitor six months ago. Upon setting it up initially, I was slightly peeved at the fact that the screen could never quite be adjusted to a 90-degree angle with the desk. At best, it tilted slightly downward. Now, six months later, gravity has had it's way with the spring tensioner in the stand, and screen now rests at around a 60-degree angle with level. I've got the stand sitting on a pile of books just to be able to look upwards at it. I've gone so far as to disassemble the stand and try to readjust the spring mechanism, but it just won't budge. Seems like a serious design flaw, I don't think I'd buy a SAMSUNG monitor again."
2,"Excellent monitor, rubbish stand","I have this monitor for a year and I have to support it with a piece of wood. The stand is worse that a plastic toy. Sometimes I wonder, do they care for their product or they just market it and if people buy it, good, if not they move to the next.For this reason I will never buy another Samsung product."
1,Not what you might think!,"Looking at the description you may think this is a DVD. You would be wrong. When I ordered it I thought it might be an episode from the television series ""American Dreams"". It is actually an audio cd of patriotic songs. So unless you want toget all pumped up for the next 4th of July celebration forget it."
1,This belongs in the trash,I've heard better audio quality from a Greeting Card; this is insult to these great songs. It has no listening selections which usually accompanies a CD shown on Amazon and was misrepresented as a DVD on the site. I know now why they didn't want anyone to hear this; given a chance I don't think anyone would waste their money on this garbage. My copy has been destroyed and is now on its way to the dump. In closing I can only hope that some day Amazon will allow ZERO ratings which I needed desperately today.
2,Low Quality,"Low quality material. Just Cotton.Bought an S-Size and it's way too big.After 1st wash, reebok logo disappeared and Colts word is vanishing.By far my most regretful buying experience in Amazon."
3,Heartless,"This appears to be an attempt to slow things down a bit and step back from the hard rockin' Wilson sisters we are use to. Mostly acoustic and orchestra on this offering, it left me a bit wanting. I think most likely if I had gotten this prior to their fine DVD ""Alive In Seattle"" I would have enjoyed it much more. Since they cover much of the same material if you were inclined to have one or the other DVD I would definitly pick up ""Alive In Seattle"" over this one. I enjoy the acoustic offerings on this, especially their rendition of Zeppelin's ""Battle of Evermore"" but at some point I would like them to pick it up a bit and rock. If like me you are a diehard fan then of course you want this in your collection. But as I mentioned previously ""Alive In Seattle"" has them doing acoustic and electric and to me is much more enjoyable."
5,Pure Class!,"This brilliant live performance really took me on my own ""road home"".Not only as a child of the 70's and 80's, but as someone who grew up in the Seattle area, Heart is a band whose songs truly live in the soundtrack of my life. Definitive cuts like ""Barracuda"" and ""Crazy on You"" are as much a part of me as my unique sense of humor, just as they are inseperable from my memories of growing up.This incredibly lush performance (in front of a hometown crowd) is not only ""unplugged"" but includes members of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, making for an unbelievable show.And Ann Wilson's voice has never sounded better.All in all, this is an absolute treat to watch."
2,An Acoutical Heart ...is Heartless!,I knew this was going to be an acoustical concert but I guess my expectations were too high. Afterwards I thought about it and said to myself...why would i want to hear barracuda or anything else of theirs without their hard driving sound? And the answer is you shouldn't if you have a choice. This is for only the die-hard fans that are in love with the songs in any form. For me it should be played in the hard driving way it was intended to be. This is great for what it is...but would you listen to Bad Company do an acoustic set? None of the reviews I read told of the all acoustic fact! It's just not the same.
2,Veronica Hart? Did I miss her?,This is a skinamax movie without Veronica Hart. You can watch it in Spanish or the original English. Bland & can been seen any late night. Set your dvr & save the money.
4,Private Pleasures Review,"The plot of the story is great, and the development of the story was great too, hoever, I didn't like the ending that much. Nonetheless, if you're a Lawrence Sanders fan, you should check this book out!"
2,Very disappointing.,"Being a Lawnrece Sanders fan, I thought this particular book left a lot to be desired. Although the storyline continues, each chapter is told from the viewpoint of a different character. The concept of the book was good, but would have been much better done as a regular story and not told from the viewpoints of the characters."
2,Dissapointed,"I was so happy that Coleman had reintroduced this cooler to their catalogue...emphasis on was. The latch is poor, is NOT stainless steel, and rusts if caught in the rain. The hinges are sub-par at best. After only a couple of outings and NORMAL wear and tear, the hinges started to pull from the insulation. Essentially they are attached directly to the ss with mere, short sheet metal screws - a piano-hinge design would be much better. Lastly, ""3 days at temperatures ranging from 90-100F and the ice stays intact"" my cat's hairball!!! Location: North Georgia, temperature: 85-90F, amt. of ice: 2 bags, result: cold water after only one full day...and we kept this cooler closed MOST of the time for experimental purposes.I returned mine after 2 weekends. Keep your money, look for the old ones at pawn shops, or beg your Dad for his older model that he loves so much. Without upgrades, this cooler is just a hunk of metal. BAD business Coleman!"
4,Barbie 46 pc puzzle,"Fun puzzle for preschoolers. Nice large pieces, ez for their little hands to assemble."
5,Best Vegas Rapper,"Romero is the best rapper from clika one. His first album was off da hook and so is this one. If really appreciate rap you will like his music. He has tight beats and tight flows. Buy this album, its worth it."
3,Good Book,Required secondary/ supplemental textbook for a business course.A good overview of multicultural management in government offices.Some legal issues as well as a considerable amount of practical information for managers and supervisors.
3,Good high level overview of FPGA and CPLDs,"I thought this book was a great overview of FPGA and CPLD technology. I have to agree that it appears to be targeted more to the manager and less targeted to the engineer actually programming these devices. I found the most useful information for people actually involved in the programming of these devices was the information covered in Chapter 5, ""Design Techniques, Rules, and Guidelines"". As a beginner to this area, I found Bob Zeidman's writing style to be very approachable but I was just left wanting more low level information. I then foundVerilog Designer's Library (Prentice Hall Modern Semiconductor Design Series: PH Signal Integrity Library). This book is written by Bob Zeidman as well which means it has the same clear writing style but is more targeted at the engineer that is actually programming the devices using Verilog."
5,"""Harry Potter"" meets ""Little Women....","""The Emperor's Fruits"" is fast paced, fun and filled to the brim with fantasy and adventure. C.E. Johnson's novel is packed with humor, powerful supernatual forces and mayhem. In addition, it is beautifully and masterfully riveted with morality lessons and over lapping themes. The reader is instructed how to develop internal power and thwart off life's difficulties while being throughly entertained. ""The Emperor's Fruits"" is a must read for all ages and genders."
5,VERY CREATIVE...FABULOUS BOOK!,"I loved the book. I could hardly put it down. There is so much behind the book, that it kept me on my toes. I recommend The Emperor's Fruits to all ages. My boyfriend loved the book as well, and he is very picky. It taught me so much on fighting demon's, facing challenges, and overcoming them. It's a must buy!"
4,single story for the kindle,"The Screaming Skull; read this on a recommendation... found it to be a terrifically creepy ghost story. It was a short easy read, but kept me engrossed til the end... and left me with a screaming question that I won't ask lest I spoil it for others.Wish I could find more by this author, either in a collection or as singles."
5,Amazing Movie,"I love all Tyler Perry Movies. And the cast of this movie is sure to satisfy. Kathy Bates is amazing in all movies and this is no exception. Love it, Love it, Buy it."
5,Tyler Perry Always teaches a moral,"T.P. reveres family, God and country and tries to teach a moral in all of his movies. We loved this movie."
5,Love it,"This one of my favorite movies by Tyler Perry. The story line is great, with wonderful actors. I highly recommend the seller and the product."
5,Lurv It!!,Great must see movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Finally a movie where they get exactly whats coming to them!!
5,The Family That Preys,Tyler Perry has created another great movie in the Family that Preys. All star cast that is wonderfully acted and a story that is so deep with a lot of everyday emotions that some of go through.
4,Commentaire sur A familly that preys,Ce film est très touchant et je recommenderai à qui que ce soit d'y jeter un coup d'oeil. Il est rempli de leons et de messages. Chaque famille est unique.Allez acheter ce film et vous constaterez...
3,The Family That Preys,I have not watch all the movie yet. When I finish the movie I might change the review. As of now it is not the best Tyler Perry movie.
5,The Best Of Tyler Perry's Films So Far!!,"I have been a fan of Tyler Perry's plays and filmworks since 2004.I own all of his plays and films and have to say that this storywhich is multi-layered and rich in character is his bestoutput so far! He uses life lessons, a gentle sense of moralitywithout being judgemental and a hilarious sense of comedictiming without being profane or disrespectful to the viewer.Tyler has truly become a phenom in the entertainment industryand a master storyteller.This one and ""Why Did I Get Married"" are definitelytestimony to that fact. Definitely worth addingto your DVD collection!"
5,VERY GOOD,THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE I CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I GIVE IS **********
5,GREAT MOVIE,This is a great story and it is all too common with what we are going through in reality.
5,The Family That Preys DVD,I placed an order for The Family That Preys DVD. The DVD arrived promptly and will order again from seller.
3,ok,once again i was very pleased with receivin this movie also within days of ordering but the disc skips and glitches but im very happy with the services!!!!
3,SCANDAL IN THE FAMILY,"TYLER PERRY DELIVERS ANOTHER OF HIS DELICIOUSLY SOAPY TALES OF LOYALTY , BETRAYAL, PASSION, AND REDEMPTION. THIS FILM IS CENTERED ON A PAIR OF ATLANTA FAMILIES, WHO STAND TO BE RIPPED APART BY GREED & SCANDAL. STARS ALFRE WOODARD AND KATHY BATES."
5,Great Movie,I just loved this movie. It has some great meaning about when to let go. Great for all of us who have adult children
3,"Does what they advertised, but...","I bought FotoShow to take with me on an international trip, figuring that zip disks would be cheaper than buying a few 128MB compact flash cards for my digital camera. When I got it, it turned out to be VERY big for traveling. It's a large unit with a heavy power supply, which is not what I had in mind.The alternative was something like a digital wallet; smaller footprint (I assume) and one disk to hold lots of 128MB downloads. However, a digital wallet won't let you view the pictures unless you have a PC with you.Having said that, it does seem to work well when viewing pictures on a TV. It has good resolution and useful features. The remote control is lousy, though. Cryptic buttons and cumbersome menus that I never seem to be able to remember without help from the manual.Note: I have not yet been overseas with FotoShow. I am assuming it will work where I'm going, but an earlier review said that it's incompatible with foreign TVs. I'll find out soon, I guess..."
2,CF tranfer too Slow,"It have nice resolution, but the transfer time to Zip drives are extremely slow!, it take about 30min to transfer a 128mb Compact Flash to a 250M ZIP drive."
1,Dissappointed with Picture Quality,"This would be a great product if they added one thing - decent picture quality when you view it on TV. I compared the exact same images viewed with the Fotoshow and with my Sony Camera -- both through the TV. The difference in quality was huge. For some reason, much of the resolution of a good photo is lost when viewed on TV. Since that's its main feature, I had to give this a low rating."
4,It does what I need it to do.,"I got the Fotoshow mainly to serve as a zip drive and as extra storage for my digital camera when I go on vacations. As a zip drive, it works as expected. It's nice to have the option to take it with me as additional storage for my digital camera. I thought of going with a digital wallet, but the thought of carrying (and dropping) a harddrive with all my pictures in it worries me.There are a few things that I think would make the Fotoshow better.1. The card slots are useless when the Fotoshow is connected to the computer via USB cable. It would be nice to be able to use the Fotoshow as a card reader.2. The power transformer is big and heavy. It should be smaller and lighter for travel.3. Option for battery/portable power.4. Faster operation when using the TV.Overall, I like the Fotoshow. I would like it better if Iomega would fix the items above."
5,This book revolutionized my view on God and Christianity,The Economy of God was a book I could not put down. It answered many questions I had about the Bible and problems I had in trying to find reconciliation among scripture. A book that clearly defines mans relationship toward God and Gods relationship with Himself in His Trinity. I have used it as reference with the Bible in defining the make up of man and the reason for mans relationship with and to God. A must read for all lovers of Christ!
5,Happy about Order,"My copy of ""The Economy of God"" got to me promptly and without any issues. The book was in perfect condition, so it was ready for my use as soon as I received it."
4,"Works, and wins, you over","Some of the tastier big band in town, Holland once again proves how to emulate many styles of approach without seeming the slightest bit redundant or derivative- something I've had to learn the hard way that sounds much easier than it actually is, even when dealing with some of the most seasoned players known."
3,Disappointing ...,"I'm a jazz fan and trombone player, and I've enjoyed most all of Dave Holland's recordings since his involvement with Robin Eubanks. Particularly good were the recent Extended Play with a small group, and What Goes Around with a big band. So I actually hunted down this recording, and was looking forward to it.What a disappointment. Some of the playing is top notch, especially Billy Kilson and Robin Eubanks, but the writing is unmemorable and overwrought, and the band's ensemble work never seems to catch fire. Recommended for drum fans (Kilson is an amazing player) but for anyone else looking for a modern big band recording, I'd advise checking out Maria Schneider, Ernie Krivda, or Bob Mintzer instead."
5,delighted,"Listening to Overtime by Dave Holland places me in a very good space. The playing, material and quality of recording are all of the highest order; which still falls short of explaining the incredible delight this cd yields. Theres a magical quality to a lot of the cd's released on the ECM label and this one is no exception. Highly recommended"
3,One of the best baseball books from inside the game,"I first read this book over 25 years ago. Leo saw it all, from the '27 Yankees, through Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier, to the dawn of the new era of baseball. I can never forget his description of The Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. If you are a baseball history fan, this is great reading."
3,"A Little Light, Lots of Shadows","While I do not think that the early (i.e. Richie Furay) POCO was generally better than the later group, both outfits are hard to compare. Times change, and I rather listen to a later ""new"" POCO than to a band trying to repeat the same sound all over again.""Under the Gun"" is admittedly not among the best post-Furay albums but it does have its moments. The sax is plainly awful, right, and makes my hair stand on end every time I listen to the whole CD. ""Legend"" (1978), ""Ghost Town"" (1982) and ""Inamorata"" (1984) were better by far - great music in its own right, and the latter two are available on a single bargain CD."
5,Wisdom for Preaching,"Welcome to the Wittgenstein of homiletics: H. Grady Davis. Many books on preaching provide only rules for fitting together the various pieces of preaching. Instead of this, Davis shows us the picture on the front of the puzzle box so that we can see what real preaching is. Davis is not concerned with specific rules for preaching, but rather with developing the preachers sense of form. His central idea is that substance and form are inseperable. An idea, he writes, is like a tree with branches reaching up towards the light. Davis walks the reader through finding ideas (trunks) to discovering how they develop (branches). I would recommend this book to anyone who feels the burden to preach the Word."
5,Super Princess Peach,"I'm just a casual gamer so I don't have a lot of skills but this game is super easy to play. It took me a while to naturally get used to the whole ""vibe"" thing but that could of been resolved if I only read the manual before playing! The controls are so easy to use and I'm brand new to DS as well. This game is a lot of fun and every Super Mario fan and classic Nintendo fan should own it!"
1,A big waste of money,"I waited to get enough money to buy this game and I was disapointed. I have had it for a week and it isn't getting better. Its like doing the same screens over and over.If you run out of emotion and need to use like say,fire. You have to start over.Get any other Mario game and you will be happy. But this is like a baby game."
1,"Platformer, not an RPG","I was expecting an RPG style game as most of the new Mario games are so I was disappointed that it was a platformer style game. I found the game play way too simplistic and offensively sexist. I mean, I thought it was kind of cool that she uses her emotions for powers but crying on vegetables to make them grow?!"
4,I NEED HELP PLEASE!!! -YOSHIGIRL,"I'M ALREADY FACING BOWSER AND NEED HELP DEFEATING HIM! I ALREADY KILLED THE HAMMER BROTHER LEADER AND THE NORMAL-SIZED BOWSER, I JUST NEED HELP ON DEFEATING THE BIG FACED BOWSER! SO IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO DEFEAT HIM PLEASE WRITE BACK!!!!!"
4,Peach,"I love this game. I'm a total Mario freak so having this game come out was amazing. It's awesome that more things open after you beat the game, not many Mario games to that. I did find it rather easy to play once you get use to all of her emotions, but it was still a lot of fun."
5,Wonderful to see a version that caters to the girls.,Finally our daughter can play Mario with more of a focus on the princess. It's a nice addition to the usual fare of only playing Mario or Luigi.
4,Super Princess Peach,"Even though this game is fairly easy, it is fun. I really appreciate the fact that the 'hero' of this story is a girl - it's about time that Princess Peach shows that she can fight and save Mario. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun but unchallenging game to play."
5,Good purchase,I was'nt sure about buying this game at first but i took a chance and now i love this game!Im 25years old and was'nt sure if it would be chalenging enough for me but it is!It's super fun & chalenging but not flustrating.Its a game oyu can play over and over and not get board.
2,hard as hell,they need age groups for ds games because this game is hard she wanted this bad and she gets frustrated she can't figure it out and hell eiother can i it is hard but being the princess instead of mario is a good change
2,Ugggghhh! Not What We Thought!,"My daughter received this for Christmas... she's 8, within 5 days of playing it she was bored. She had already finished more than 1/2 the game. Not challenging at all.Buy a different game!"
4,Princess Peach isn't any less than them boys...,"I love this game! At first I was a little leary (Peach always kind of annoyed me) but after I got the game and started playing it, I knew Nintendo had done it again and made another masterpiece! The game is a little easier than previous Mario games but it can still definitely be challenging! I enjoyed the mini games and the puzzles (you collect the pieces as you complete stages). After you beat the game for the first time you have to go back around and beat every stage again (while collecting new puzzle pieces and mini game stages). Every time you beat another boss, more stages get added to the next world. usually about 3 stages are added and they are relatively shorter than the original stages but definitely a nice addition.I liked the little twist Nintendo brought out in using Princess Peach's emotions as attacks. It was very original and it is fun and different.If you own a DS, this game is a must have."
4,good game,good clean fun for the whole familyI would recommend this productcould be cheaper but still a nice buy over all
5,Excellent Game,We purchased this for our 7 year old daugher. She spent hours the first day while we were traveling over the holidays and loved the game!
4,Hard But Pretty,The graphics on this are nice. I love the way everything is drawn. The idea behind the game is good. If you are not great at Mario style games you will be frustrated. I got stuck at this one spot early on and could not beat the spot. I loaned it to my daughter who got just as frustrated. Then after a friend could not stand to play it for the same problems I just traded it out.I recommend this to people who were good at the old Mario games. For the rest of us it is just plain annoying. I wish that I had enjoyed the game play itself more. The idea with the emotes is very nicely done. It was just too hard for most people I know.
3,Welsh Rockers Off to a good start...,"I picked this up as an impulse buy from the local independent record store (Record and Tape Traders in the Baltimore metro). The first 15 seconds or so had me regretting my purchase, but it turns out it was just a bad intro because the rest of the song was pretty good. The display at the story compaired People in Planes to Muse. It's a fairly accurate comparrison. I'd like to hear a little more before I form an opinion on the band overall. It was a good effort, but probably no smash singles or anything like that. I would think People in Planes to be worth checking out as an opening band for sure, and in time this could turn out to be a pretty nice little band. They just need to find their groove. If you see the EP around pick it up so you can say you heard of them second (I obviously heard of them first), especially if you can find it for 99 cents. They are also offering it online for $5, which is a pretty good deal. Look for the full length out in Spring 06!"
5,WOW,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EVER SINCE THE DVD WAS INVENTED...I STARTED WATCHING THIS WHEN I WAS LIKE 10 OR SO AND NOW IN MY LATE 20S... ITS BEEN 5 DAYS SINCE I HAVE GOTTEN THIS DVD AND AM ON THE LAST DISC ALREADY HAVING A BEAUTY AND THE BEAST MARATHON NIGHT EACH NIGHT AFTER WORK... I CANT WAIT FOR THE SECOND SEASON TO COME OUT ... FEELS LIKE AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MYSELF
5,A gift,"For all of us, the true fans of this beautiful show, this is a dream come true. My oldest son sent this to me as a gift for Valentine's Day. We watched it when he was young and now I'm reintroducing it to my 12 year old daughter. Who I'm happy to say, loves it as much as we do. It didn't take long for me to be drawn back into the world of Catherine and Vincent. It's as though I've gone back in time and I am sharing their love all over again. How romantic. 20 years was a long time to wait, but worth it. Thank you for bringing this beautiful show back for all of us to enjoy again. And to the fans of the show, who don't remember it as well as they thought they did, remember it WAS the 80's."
5,A Show Like an Unexpected Song...,The slowly developing relationship of a self-actualized but (initially) painfully shy individual and an (initially) vain and selfish attorney is an incrediblly beautifully written journey. I think most of us wish the journey hadn't stopped so soon.
5,Great Buy!,"I loved this show when I was a kid (was 8 when it first aired) - and I still love it now! Granted, I understand a LOT more of what's going on now. If you can get past the 80's/90's fashion, the big hair styles, and slightly cheesy music (think about when it was first created), it really is a fabulous series! I absolutely love Ron Perlman in this! I couldn't stop watching it (finished the season in about a week), and now I'm impatiently waiting for the 2nd season to be released! Too bad this show didn't have a longer run!"
5,Like A Warm Romantic Hug,"Watching this DVD is like getting a warm hug from someone you've missed so much. I adored this show then and now. I haven't gotten all the way through the entire set yet, but it so wonderful to watch this well-written and character driven show. I haven't re-met some of my favorite characters like Mouse and Pascal, but I can't wait. This DVD is like a good book and will be re-read many times to come.We MUST have seasons two and three. It would be too cruel to a very loyal fandom to not release them."
5,love Vincent,"Any fan of the show ""Beauty And The Beast"" from the late 80's should defintley by this DVD!!! It was great seeing the fist season. I remembered everything!!! Although now looking at it, it seems a little hokey, but all in all, a great DVD to have. Can't wait until season 2 comes out!!!! Gotta love Vincent!!!"
5,Enter A Time When Love Was More Than An Act,"Epic fantasy, and romanticism on a grand scale were hallmarks of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and despite the fact that, in the first season at least, there was not so much as one 'real' kiss between the two phenomenal lead actors ( Linda Hamilton, and Ron Perlman ), the State of New York could have been lit up with the electricity generated by them.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was also blessed with wonderful supporting actors, excellent writing, great music, and ( for the time ) second-to-none production values. I have yet to see a series, or indeed, many movies that explored the issue of love with more lyricism, or poignancy."
3,I want it in multiregion with subtitles,"I love this tv serie. But the only fault is that it is only in English, without the posibility of taking it in region 2 and with subtitles.Me parece horroroso que esta serie únicamente se puede obtener en region 1 y solamente en ingles sin posibilidad de subtitulos.No he tenido otra posibilidad pero me gustaria que esta serie se pudiera conseguir en multiregion, y aunque no se pueda conseguir en idioma europeos, como en español...u otro, se podría hacer una versión Pal con subtitulos en otros idiomas.No creo que sea tanto trabajo...."
4,Nostalgic TV Show,"Beauty & The Beast is a show about a sensitive guy who is willing to break necks (does several times) and a woman who went from princess to freedom fighter, as well as the ""tragic"" love affair between the two. I'll admit, this series was one of those 80's ""sensitive"" shows, but I find it refreshing to see some of the old story lines (with.. some bad acting) that wasn't so concerned with political correctness. I always liked the few shows I could find on VHS tape, so I was happy to get the series on DVD. Its nothing amazing, but I'm happy with it."
5,unique and magical,"I too was a devoted fan of this unique, magical romance -- until the producers/writers killed off Linda Hamilton's character (they should have paid her whatever she wanted to stay on). The last few episodes could only have been written by someone deranged by drug abuse.Nevertheless I shall look forward to seeing Season One at least.You may be interested to know that at the height of the show's popularity an audio tape was made of actor Ron Perlman reading romantic poetry. He had to wear the full lion's-head makeup to do the tape, otherwise his voice sounded different. The tape was a smash hit, especially with guys as gifts for their girlfriends. The then elderly owner of Toronto's biggest record store ""Sam the Record Man"" commented that he never could have imagined his greatest-ever seller would be a tape of a man in a cat suit quoting poetry.Go figure!"
5,Couldn't love this show more if I tried!,"These DVDs are the best money I've spent in a long time! It would have been nice if they'd included some bonus footage, but I love them."
2,I Remembered it Being Better,"I loved this show as a child. I was about 10 when Vincent and Catherine first stole my heart. However, now many years later I find myself very bored re-watching this show. I don't know if I only enjoyed it the first time because I was so young, or that TV has changed so much in the intervening years that this show seems old fashion and out of date. The relationship that once seemed so romantic between Vincent and Catherine now seems kind of silly and over the top--like I'm reading a dime store bodice ripper minus the steamy sex. The plots are predictable and boring.I am very disappointed :( I wanted to love it again! Oh well...I have my memories."
4,Finally on DVD--but no extras!!!,"I loved this show when it was on, and was thrilled to see it on DVD (even if it did take 20 years) The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the lack of extras! Come on--some director commentary, storyboards, out takes, deleted scenes, something! I hope the producers will add something for seasons 2 and 3!"
5,My Only Complain,"Finally this excellent tv series in on DVD. My only complain is that they should have issued the three seasons at the same time. I have the feeling that if this one does not sell well, they will not issue season 2 and season 3. Also no extras, no scene selection. This was done without any care for the fans. Apparently the people originally involved in the creation of the series have nothing to say or contribute to the product.AGD"
5,Wonderful,I remembered how much I loved this show when it came out in the 80's. Still a wonderful show to watch.
5,Beware the Shoulder Pads!,"I was soooo happy when I saw that BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was finally on DVD. I loved the show when it first hit TV and I love it still on DVD. This series was so way ahead of it's time. It might appear tame compared to recent shows like BUFFY or SUPERNATURAL, but BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is more along the lines of HEROES. It's about human nature, the personal beast within us all and most of all it's about love. I had forgotten just how romantic this show is. It's rather refreshing and makes a nice change from forensic evidence. Thematically, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still very revelant. Too bad they couldn't anticipate the downfall of the oversized shoulder pad though."
5,Beauty and The Beast,I loved the series and was please to find in on CD. You get you monies worth of good entertainment without the violence you see in todays shows.
2,Great show - terrible dvd quality,"I was glad to see this dvd set released, but I am very disappointed in the quality of the presentation. I have thoroughly enjoyed the shows once again, although I have not finished watching the first season yet. I fully expected a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, since I'm sure the original show was recorded that way. But some effort could have been put into cleaning up the video transfer a bit. It doesn't even look like anyone cleaned up weak horizontal/vertical synch signals, as every now and then a scene will lose its vertical stabilization briefly on my tv (no - it isn't my player or tv because this is the only dvd in my large collection that behaves this way). If this dvd set comes out in a ""remastered"" version someday, I am going to be very upset. But the shows themselves are as enjoyable to me today, as they were when I watched them in prime-time, years ago."
5,beauty and the beast,perfect ! my daughter and I are watching with much enjoyment. As are my sister and her daughter. I got a set for them also !
5,Memories of my Childhood,"I was eight years old when this show first premeired. I remember watching the pilot episode and immediately falling in love with the characters, the love story and oddly enough the name ""Catherine."" I thought it was the most beautiful name I had ever heard and wished that my parents would have given me such a name. I swore that if I ever had a little girl I would name her ""Catherine."" Finally after nineteen years the ""powers that be"" finally compiled the first season on DVD. I have been having a wonderful time rewatching these episodes and reliving my childhood in the process. But more than that, the most amazing part is that I get to watch them with my five month old daughter ""Kathryn."" I know that anyone who buys this DVD collection will be glad they did. It certainly is money worth spending. Kathryn and I await anxiously for the release of seasons two and three."
5,Excellent! Waiting for Seasons 2 & 3,"I was nearly 10 years old when I watched parts of the three seasons on the national channel (Greece). I was amazed and touched by the cruelty and romance of this 'masterpiece'.Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the quality (in comparison with the TV version) but, sincerely, the series itself is an excellent fairy tale (?) that I wish to have for my children.It is obvious, that I am anxiously looking forward to Seasons 2 &3 on DVD."
4,minimal but satisfactory pack,"Nothing fancy about this long-awaited pack but nothing downright disappointing either. Everything is there and the quality is satisfactory - for now. As long as the upcoming 2nd season does have some extras I'm at peace! But I cannot help dreaming that... by the time all 3 seasons have been released, the master tapes for 1st season will have been found again, and we'll be treated with a special edition all-season collector pack! Who, me, a utopist?"
1,clips cannot be turned,don't buy this seat. The clips on the back need to be rotated and it's impossible. We returned it. Horrible seat!
1,Horrible-don't waste your money,"Purchased this seat for our granddaugher to use in our car when she goes with us. It was very difficult to adjust the straps once she was seated in the seat. Also in assembling it to move the shoulder straps to the correct slot, there is no way you can follow the directions of rotating the metal plate. We had to take a screwdriver and force it out in order to adjust the shoulder straps. I liked the looks of the plaid cover so I gave it 1 star for that reason only. We were able to take it back and will end up buying a different booster car seat. This one is horrible so don't waste your money on it!"
2,I am returning mine,This seat is problematic for exactly the reasons the others mentioned. It is almost impossible to adjust the height of the straps as the metal clamps cannot be removed with other than brute force and a tool. The inserts to the buckles fall through the holes at the bottom. I don't understand how anyone can design such a seat and try to sell it. Have they ever tried to use it themselves? I have bought several car seats over the years. This one is clearly the worst
3,Good for the price,"Have to agree that car seat design in general could really use some help. I personally love the articles that act as though it's the parents that are too incompetent to install them properly.I have not had any trouble with this car seat as yet. Good to know from other reviewers though about the problems with the lack of padding.Reason for 3 stars:-Black cover???? (No other pattern available in the store.)-Don't think this car seat would be good for stocky kids. Doesn't seem to be much thigh room when buckled in, and the tongue buckles lean inward potentially poking kids in the stomach.-The clips do fall through the holes in the bottom of the seat (the seat, not the padding), but some good ol' masking tape fixed that problem."
1,Adjustments Are Not Easy,"We bought this seat as a back-up seat to my husband's car. We hardly ever use it. This past weekend I went to use it and noticed we needed to make adjustments to the strap height - this ended up being a nightmare. I could not get one of the metal clips to snap in the way it says it should have. I even used a hammer (which at that point I knew it was getting returned) and the piece would not go in. This made me very disappointed and frustrated. Very poor design. Also, please note that the fabric also started fading after about 4 months and the cup holder would not stay on."
2,A NIGHTMARE,I PURCHASED THIS SEAT BECAUSE IT WAS MORE COST EFFECTIVE...I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX...AND PLACED MY ADORABLE 2.6 YEAR OLD IN IT.....WHAT A NIGHTMARE TO FIGURE OUT THE HARNESS....AND WHEN SHE SLEPT HER HEAD CAME FORWARD...SIDEWAYS..ALL OVER....COMFORT IS A MUST FOR ME...I RETURNED IT IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS AND PURCHASED A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE EDDIE BAUR VANTAGE POINT COMFORT HIGHBACK....MUCH BETTER...IT EVEN RECLINES FOR A BETTER NAP.....
2,Bigger Baby SKIP this one,"I do have a BIG 2 year old. He is 48lbs. and a little over 3 feet. He out grew his car SEATS fast. I though this one would last awhile. WRONG! I can't buckle it between his legs their is no thigh room, your toddler needs to have really skiny legs no matter what they weigh. The buckles are ALWAYS slipping through the bottom. The attachable arm rests and cup holder are made so poorly my son pulls them right out!! To adjust the harnes you have to take the whole thing apart!!I been reading reviews the COMPASS is getting great reviews. I am going out tomorrow to buy it, and then throwout my CHASE"
1,A Big Pain!,I too spent the better part of an hour trying to install thisseat properly. We needed a 2nd seat for our other car and Ithought this would do the trick. It is not easy to thread theseat belt through the very small opening in the back of the seat. Then the buckles continue to fall through the holes on the side. Black - for a kids seat? Come on... We do not needto bake our children! I returned this lousy seat and boughta Compass 500. My daughter is 36pds. and just a hair shy of the height requirement but she fit in it beautifully. A great seat! Don't bother with the Chase!
2,5 point harness is cumberson,"After purchasing a new car, we found that our older Graco seat didn't fit. I purchased this seat hoping it would fit better and it does. I was able to install the seat easily and it is extremely tight. However, my daughter is still under the thirty pound limit so we have to continue to strap her using the 5 point harness. What a cumbersome process!! Like the previous reviewer, the lower latches slide down below the seat and you have to fish them out. The adjustable strap that is placed on the harness itself, just seems to get in the way. I am not looking forward to this winter and having to fuss with those straps in the bitter cold."
3,"Worked fine, but too wide for the bucket seats in the van","This seat is very secure and doesn't shift at all. I also liked the 5 point harness as it was the only one that was big enough for my very tall three year old. Now that we are using the seat belt we have trouble fitting it around the seat and latching it. Our seats must be kind of narrow. My daughter can't undo the seat belt because it catches on the seat. We have to jiggle it to get it out. Overall, we like the seat and will use it when our son needs a booster with a five point harness, but for our daughter we are going to switch to a narrower seat."
1,COLOR NOT TRUE,"Item arrived timely, however, the color is not the same as in the salon, thus defeating the purpose of touch ups in between salon visits. Thought my purchase was for unopened bottles that were sealed, they were not sealed. They claim ""they sell new and authentic products"", however, if item is unsealed, how can it be new! Was told no refunds on open bottles, (bottle came unsealed) so you really have no way of knowing if color is right unless you try it, then you can't return it because it's been opened! Makes no sense. Poor return policy. Will not buy from them again!"
1,wrong picture,"picture shows larger 2.4 battery but add says 1.7 size. no response from seller, working with amazon which is always great. arrived in a timely manner."
1,Not very good,The video was too dated. I thought it was newer. I would not recommend it. I bought it to use with a subtance abuse group and they only watched about half of it and didn't want to see the rest.
5,should be mandatory viewing in all treatment facilities,"although a bit dated (film made in '86)..the movie depicts very clearly what it is like to be an active alcoholic, and what that does to a person's family. We see the legal problems, the work problems, the family problems that are caused because of someone's drinking.Also shown is the co-dependency of several family members, as they make excuses for and cover-up the father's behavior. We see the verbal and physical abuse they have to endure.I found it very difficult to watch...had to hit pause and come back later and watch more of the film, a segment here, a segment there. It's a very sad film, but an accurate one. You should buy this for your recovery library.Martin Sheen's performance is just great here."
4,Metric tape,It is nice to be able to buy a complete metric tape in the US.The only way we used to be able to get them was to have one of the Japanese machinery techs give you one.
3,Plumbing tools.,Wish it was designed better so it could fit in tighter places. Other than that good enough tool to get the job done. Second one Dad miplaced the first one we bought together.
5,The Honorable(?) James Lester,"Parlimentary elections are just around the corner. James Lester is the leader of the his party which is far ahead in polls. He is all but certain to be the next Prime Minister. Then there is an accusation of sexual affair. Lester denies it, but the evidence is strong. Is the accuser emotionally disturbed?, part of a frame-up?, or is golden boy Lester a liar?The story is told in a series of reports, diary entries, and newspaper articles - a very effective technique for this kind of story. The main viewpoint is that of Linda Tandy, the daughter of a newspaper editor who supports and is trying to clear Lester's name, and Linda, needless to say, is in love with Lester. We see Linda's emotions rise up when there is new evidence for Lester and then plummet as even more damning evidence against him surfaces.Nicely written, well-plotted novel, with good strong characters. As a bonus there is a clever ""locked room"" gimmick."
2,"Great movie, poor encoding.",I don't know how this DVD is encoded but non of my players managed to give a proper picture and this includes top of the line Oppo BDP83 coupled with an EDGE scaler or a PS3... In all cases the picture is still heavily combed.Appart from that is still the wacky and funny movie I remembered and I enjoyed watching it again.
2,Perhaps not the Best,"This is a fleeting history of the Boer War. Not very accurate and perhaps not the best available. A title in the ""War File"" Series entitled ""The Boer War: A Bitter and Bloody Clash of Arms"" is perhaps a better buy.This is a one sided view of the Boer War - it would have been more pertinent having both views presented.The scramble for Africa content is not accurate, unfortunately.As there is scant Visual Material on the Boer war - this will at least be somewhat informative."
1,Boer War or Bored War?,Dull as dish-water - save your money and wait for a decent film about this war. I wish I had.
5,"Graceful, Beautiful and Haunting Pop Music","Delta Goodrem has one of those voices that can appeal to a broad variety of styles, and personal tastes. She infuses each note with grace and elegance that makes each song noteworthy and hauntingly beautiful. Her piano playing adds a elegance to each song, with the steady pop background music makes each track catchy, sing-along-able and classic in its own right."
1,what a waste of money,"When i first listen to ""Born To Try"" my heart told me to buy her CD. I Buy it and at first i found it interesting. But after hear it for a second time, i found that almost all of the song had a same tune and melody. It became boring after you kept listen to it. the only good song in this CD is ""Innocent Eyes"". I wonder how australian can said that this CD is more good than Kylie ""BL""."
5,Goodrem Value for your money,"Delta Goodrem shows other ex soap stars how its done with stunning ballads ""Lost Without You"", ""Born To Try"" the first singles. These piano and singer based songs are performed and written by her and you can tell as she sings them. Stand out tracks include Innocent Eyes and Predictable but 90% of these could be future singles, a must have."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST,i've owned innocent eyes for over a year now and i still havent got sick of it! delta has a powerful beautiful voice and her songs are all so meaningful. my fave songs would have to be innocent eyes and born to try they are just outstanding! if u dont own a copy of this excellent album i urge u to buy a copy its definately worth the money :)
3,dull,"VERY GOOD VOICE BUT NEVER PUT TO THE TEST, KEPT EXPECTING SOME THUMP OR STRENGTH TO THE SONGS...NEVER GOT THERE"
4,Wow,"It's been a long time since a woman singer has wow-ed me, Delta Goodrem has done it. Every song on this album is superb, the emotion she puts on the songs is wonderful."
5,Beyond Words,This album is incredible. I've had it for over a year and it and it is still the best album I have ever bought!Each song means something and her amazing vocals and piano skills amaze!Micheal Hunt and followers- Looks like you forgot to do your research; Delta had 3 No.1's before she was diagnosed with cancer.
3,Dunno,"Middle of the road, some good songs, some annoying ones, i can't listen to this whole album all at once, but it's ok, there's a large bunch of piano vocalist artists coming through, she's ok, not the best i've heard though, also though give her a listen if you're into piano powered pop ballads..."
5,"Excellent, Fantastic Wonderfull Album","This is one of my best album. My fav tracks are : Not Me, Not I,Butterfly and Throw it Away.Delta is one of the new aspiring Australian Artists and she has wonderful voice. I am not big fan of aust music however I Have to say that this is one of the best albums i have listened to.Worth buying and its 100% satisfaction."
5,Better than Celine Dion,"Exquisite songwriting, great band, lush production and a fantastic voice make this a ""must have"". Out of the 14 tracks I rate 11 as being outstanding."
1,Delta Goodrem cd-Innocent Eyes,STILL have not received this cd from seller! It's been 5 weeks! What's up Amazon???
1,A textbook lesson in how the music industry works .................,"This was another contender for the ""Young Girl Trying Too Hard"" Grammy. She had the voice, she had the looks, she had the desire, and lots of older people saw money to be made. But although it sold a lot of copies, it was hollow, like her at the time (she was 16/17). To illustrate, her main thankyous were to her angels ""for your spiritual guidance"" and the piano ""for being such a magical instrument"".Luckily her life has thrown a lot at her since then and she grown because of it."
4,to MH,"To a previous reviewer, Delta has Hodgkins disease, a type cancer arising from the lymph nodes and has undergone chemotherapy. Delta also had 3 or 4 number one hits in Australia before news of her illness became public. Your comments tell us alot about the type of person you are and your ignorances. Great Debut album from the young Australian, and I look forward to listening to more of her music in the future."
5,Just so beautiful...Every Pop Fan should have this!,"What a beautiful, heartfelt, emotional touching debut album, from such a sweet talented singer who could become the OZ Celine Dion and more - Delta easily leaves Kylie & Co behind, and is no Britney sorry - As Delta without needing to take the clothes of like Brit, can sing, and Britney not. This Album should be on every Pop Fan shelves - She is hot, and dont let the ""Neighbours"" Tag fool you, she got professional Classical Music and Singing background, where untalented wanabes like Britney/Jessica Simpson have not, and she writes her own songs, many dont. So please if you've not already got it, buy it now...This so talented GIRL is so good...I seen her at a concert, she just rocks one of the best concert I've seen, and Delta pulls it off no sweat! (Minus that jucky Brian stuff obviously) ...SO please Buy this Album Innocent Eyes now, you cant go wrong! :)"
3,when she still was worth listning to11,"must be here last album before she made her complete change. it's a shame she chose to become such a pop star wannabe as she is now, trying to sound like celine.I used to like her, admire her a lot but not anymore, now it isn't much about her music but about her being he new sex kitten, before that she was interesting and made some decent songs, now she is just becoming a nothing sating pop singer like so man others. I hope she will change back to the real her one day and make a decent album again, and hen maybe she will get some of her old fans back and not only having those completely upsets fans, also called, the delta force."
5,An Inspirational First CD,"I first heard of her through a few friends from overseas. I decided to check out a few songs and it wasn't long before I was hooked! She has a beautiful voice, perfect for the style of music she performs on this disk. Although her music is aimed more at the teen age group, it's not as poppy as Britney or Christina. It should appeal to adults and kids alike. I urge you all to check out ""Innocent Eyes"" and ""In My Own Time"" as well as the first single ""Born to Try.""I also strongly reccommend her second album, Mistaken Identity."
4,A burning story - Casca roasted well and good.,"Casca falls foul of the Brotherhood in Persia whilst serving the King Shapur II. A typically good Sadler novel, well-paced, informative historically and full of action. This follows on from The Warlord and precedes the Damned, so its best to read these books in that order to get the feel of the life of the main character. You can't help feeling for the main character as he is betrayed and sentenced to burning at the stake - but I won't give the plot away by telling you how an immortal man survives that! Read it for yourself, its a great action fantasy adventure."
5,beautifully composed.. it has changed my life forever,This CD has brought hope to my once miserable existance. I will be forever grateful to this wonderful band. Thank you for opening my eyes.
4,"Good, but Kapelovitz absence noticable","Once again, more velvety space noise from the dicks. Unfortunately, the absence of supreme supreme dick, Dan Kapelovitz, is noticable. despite this, it is still a good record. vive le dicks!"
5,superb,A brilliant analysis of the steps and missteps that led up to WWII and Hitler's rise. It is the best on the topic that I have read.
3,get low,good film. This is how low budget films are supposed to be done. Very depressing too. That baby is kinda freaky. This film is very old looking but done pretty well.
3,comedy gold,"this movie has it all- grimiest apt ever, eraserhead baby, stilted dialogues and voiceovers, exaggerated junkies (one of whom finds an ingenious way to mainline), a twelve-year-old hooker, reviewers who take this movie seriously, 80s synth-pop score, neighborhoods that are either new york or beirut, a culmination of the inevitable murder-suicide. i haven't laughed this hard in a loooong time!"
1,BORING!!! waste of money!,o.k. first let me say I love crappy movies but COME ON! This movie is a total waste of time and money. It's an hour and a half of some skanky dude that can't act walking around New York. WOW! Then in the last 3 min's of the movie he kills his whole family and then himself. This movie has no point. If you want a cool TROMA movie stick to THE TOXIC AVENGER MOVIES.
5,An underrated gem! Inventive no-budget art!,"""Combat Shock"" is one of those rare microbudget films that has a lasting impact on its viewers. Originally titled, ""American Nightmares"", ""Combat Shock"" plays like a really grimy, amateurish version of ""Eraserhead"" with a little bit of ""First Blood"" and ""Taxi Driver"" thrown in. The commentary is extremely helpful, and Buddy went on to direct ""No Way Home"" with Tim Roth. If you're expecting an over-the-top satire Troma style, you're in for a surprise. The last 15 minutes of the movie may very well blow your mind. Also, the plotline predates ""Jacob's Ladder"", which is an almost exact word-for-word descendant of this sometimes cheesy, but mostly honest film of urban decay and psychopathy in the mind of a Vietnam vet. Lloyd, you sure know how to pick 'em! Buy the dvd and see what I mean. Remember, it is pretty shocking though, with that special graphic violence that will Tromatize you forever!"
3,We want the Three Degrees,"It's pretty good if you are a real Three Degrees fan. Some of the songs I never heard before but, they're not bad songs. They kind of grow on you. It's a good CD for a rainey day, or if your just kicked back listing to music."
4,School Text Book,This book has all the information in it that my teacher requires so it's the book I was asked to purchase. I really don't have any feelings about it one way or another since this is just a school text book. I will say that it is very heavy and hard back. I would have preferred a lighter book to transport around.
5,Mewingham Manor,The art work is wonderful. It is hard to put the book down. Lovely story.I have shared this book with many of my friends.
3,A Fresh Fragrance,"Use this for the times when you want a simple, fresh scent in summertime. Reminds me of a lighter version of Nautica for women."
4,Very Good but corrupted copy,"I have used this video before and it is very good. My only problem with it, is that my copy was corrupted."
5,This is top notch West Coast playing,"This disc is actually ""Quartet: Russ Freeman and Chet Baker"" & is a Russ Freeman session issued under Chet's name. Russ composed 6 of the 8 tunes & he makes Chet work for his wages.The album opens amusingly with ""Love Nest,"" otherwise known as the theme for the Burns & Allen Show. Russ takes the lovely ""Summer Sketch"" solo half of the way through, then bringing Chet in for no more than a wonderfully pensive turn at the melody. That's followed by, for me, the album's two most swinging cuts, ""An Afternoon at Home"" & ""Say When."" They also pay homage to Billy Strayhorn with a romantic arrangement of ""Lush Life.""This is top notch West Coast playing, with Shelly Manne on sticks & Leroy Vinnegar on big fiddle. Recorded in 1956. No singing. Check out the thumbnails on the insert by photographer William Claxton then check out the collections of great photos Claxton shot of this era & these talented musicians.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
5,Chet baker is God with a trumpet,He is the master of trumpet jazz. This is the most orginal CD I have ever heard. His playing is better than people give him credit for. This is what jazz in the 1950's was like. This is how Jazz should be !
4,Great product support,I ordered this product because it was a good value. Expected a cheap product but it is a quality one. I did have one issue due to manufacturing defect and I called the company and they replaced it free of charge. Great support.
2,Stuff Sack,This Stuff sack is really too small for our sleeping bag and it takes a man's strength to get it in. I could have used more guidance in order to choose the correct size of sack for my sleeping bags.
5,Fusion Explosion!,"Derek Sherinian is an amazing keyboard player but i think he needs to be carefull not to let his guitarists out shine him.Zack Wylde,Yngwie Malmsteen and Al DiMeola are awesome on this cd.No need to critque the songs on this one, they are all fantastic, this is fusion at its absoulute best!I only wish the younger generation were more exposed to this kind of music which manages to be dark and heavy without all the hate filled lyrics in the mainstream these days.I'm just thankfull that music like this is avaliable.This is a cd that leaves one wondering how did i ever live without it?"
2,terrible mix,"I had high hopes for this album since I loved Planet X's ""Moonbabies"" CD. However, I was very dissapointed. My dissapointment isn't due to the songs, though. A lot of the songs are very good and feature some spectacular performances from Sherinian and various guitar gods. My dissapointment is with the overall sound of this album. The mix is horrible. It actually makes it unbearable to listen to more than a couple of times. There is essentially no bass in the mix and everything else just sounds very weak. If it weren't for this, I'd probably have given this album 4 or 5 stars."
3,Really should be 5,"First off musically wise this CD is phenomenal. Not only is the line up of musicians great, they all put in wonderful performances.So why 3 stars? Because the engineering is GARBAGE! It is sooo annoying that sooo many quality musicians take the time to put together and produce such great music only to have the sound quality suck. The opening tracks especially sound like they were recorded in a tin box. Very flat, bass deficient, no depth at all. Not what I would expect from such a quality line up.Mythology is much better, however not perfect either. Once again, too bad because this could be an awesome album instead of a mediocre one."
3,Weakest solo effort,".Where's Derek ?..Quote ""I only wish though that the keys would be a bit louder in the mix and not be lost to everything else that goes around it"".I could not give a better desciption than the other reviewer did!.This is what's wrong with this CD. Derek _is_ incredibly good and I could not wait to get his newest album but I am sorry to say that I'm disappointed.Planet-X (the album) and Inertia, his solo albums, in addition to his contributions to Platypus and Planet-X (the band) are _MUCH_ better than this display of speed guitar.3 stars ... There's far too much 'everything else that goes around it'. There was no need at all for this 'incredible line up' of artists, he could have been the star without the other stars (*) ... Looking forward to future work of Derek the great.(*) I absolutely love the work of every individual artist performing on this 'get together' but do not expect a 'joint venture' entitled Derek Sherinian."
1,Waste of Money,"This is more of an instructional video that you might watch in a high school PE class once before you go out and try it than a pilates routine designed for lower back pain. It gives a few minutes of explanation for each move along with ""recaps"" on previous moves, but never establishes a fluid routine. This painful process goes on for an hour! DVD is a complete waste of money, try MTV pilates if you are trying to strengthen your back and stomach!"
1,"Poor quality: DVD, program and acting","I wouldn't have given this DVD one star but wasn't allowed to rate it ""No Stars."" I just returned the DVD for a refund. Why? First, the quality of the DVD itself is unacceptable, the picture is grainy and very poor, the audio is off pace with the ""Actor's"" voice (very distracting). For these reasons, I would have returned the DVD even if the program was good. But it wasn't. It is the most boring pilates program I've ever seen. Is it really pilates? My husband bought this DVD as a gift for me. When it arrived, we decided to preview it before using it to work out. In less than 3 minutes I noticed my husband had fallen asleep. I started to laugh but dozed off myself before I could get out a chuckle (seriously). I am very disappointed that Amazon didn't have their quality control check out this DVD before offering it for sale."
5,Makes Current Alaska Native Life Utterly Compelling,"Yes, this is a collection of essays. But it is also a collection of stories, for Tom Kizzia is a skillful narrative writer on a par with the very best fiction writers. He takes readers into the heart of Alaska Native culture, revealing along the way the contradictions of the intersection of modern life with ancient traditions. But that description makes this book sound like work, and it is, rather, the kind of book that makes a person long to get OUT of work in order to read it. I could not put this book down."
5,Should Have Been a Best Seller!,"I lived in Interior Alaska from 1971 to 1986 - working with some of these same Native peoples and traveling to the bush some - and I only had a ""whiff"" of these incredible stories. You could live your whole life in Alaska and not experience one of these stories - the airfare alone would be several years' wages for most of us. I especially appreciate his filling in the blanks on the Russian Orthodox church in Alaska . . . and the sauna stories (I am a sauna addict from living up there - and once was in a U of AK sauna when some visiting Yupik elders had put ice on the thermostat - to see if there college kids from the village were still tough - their skin was getting mottled red and purple from the heat). Also appreciate the care the author took with portraying people who are masters of skills and a lifestyle very different from his, and yet who perhaps would not be appreciated by most literati. A belated thank you for this excellent read."
4,A decent album - though not their best,"Well, this is LBS's first album since the massive shake-up where Yves and Michel went off to do their own thing, and it goes without saying that the band is different since they left. The sound is similar - foot stomping and traditional instruments superimposed against backdrops of jazz, and even some funk in this case - but it seems to lack the direction other albums have had. The first two tracks Tiguidou pack-sack and Paye la traite are promising but then it drops off a little. There two songs that could be classified as gems: Ma femme est morte which borderlines on storytelling, and the rollicking Si l'hiver peut prendre, which LBS says captured the mood of the group during recording. All in all J'ai jamais is a good solid album, but not the best. My personal opinion is that the best album LBS has done to date is En Spectacle (1996). The first 6 tracks are worth the price of the album alone. Still, this album deserves 4 stars."
4,Good product with exception,Easy to inflate. My guest who slept on it says it is comfortable but lost air after the first night. We had to add a little air after each night.
2,Not very durable.......,"I purchased this product two months ago with the intention of using it for three weeks whilst we gave up our bed for visitors. The bed had been used for a period of two weeks prior by another guest with no problems. Hmm, after a couple of nights the bed must have developed a leak because we had to keep blowing it up in the middle of the night. By the third week, it was literally impossible to tolerate anymore. It deflated continuously (we couldn't locate the leak) and we would wake up with bones jabbing into the floor all night long....not very comfortable to say the least. We threw it in the trash by the end of week three. In conclusion, durability is not one this beds strongest assets!"
2,"Lousy product, great customer service","I ordered this 2 months ago and the second time it was used, all the air leaked out and our houseguests ended up sleeping on the rock-hard floor all night. What a hunk of junk! I would have thought that the more expensive AeroBed would hold up better than most cheaply-made knock-off brands.I contacted Amazon about a refund and since it's been more than 30 days I can't get my money back. Fair enough. HOWEVER, the customer service guy was so incredibly helpful, and he said they can exchange the item no problem. He arranged to have a new one sent to me, waived the shipping fee for express delivery, and emailed me a link so I can print a return label and send the defective bed back. The new one will be on my doorstep within a few days and I have 30 days to send the old one back.Hopefully the new bed will hold up better than the old one, but WOW! What service from Amazon!! Thanks, guys!"
5,durable and comfortable,"Over the years, we've gone through a lot of air beds, it seemed the more expensive they were, the harder they were to deflate. I was so pleased to see how durable these were (we have two, twin and queen) and how easy to inflate AND deflate.We can just get whim to go out and look for shooting stars and it's ready in minutes. And it's perfect for grandchildren and guests, very compfortable."
1,It developed a leak after two weeks of use.,I would not purchase this product. It developed a leak after two weeks of use.
3,Good enough,"I bought a couple of these for my occasional visitors. They were reported as comfortable, however, the built-in pillow was insufficient. Also note that the mattresses are inflated with a rechargeable pump. This pump must be charged for 24 hours prior to the first use. Don't wait until bedtime to charge the pump."
4,Great Product,This is the 2nd one of these that we have purchased. They inflate quickly and easily and stay inflated all night. They are comfortable to sleep on and easy to put away.
4,So far so good,"We have used it about 10 nights now for guests and we have't had a leak yet. Blows up firm. Only issue is that the battery can die and you must recharge before using again....which makes it difficult when you need it that night. We ended up charging for only 1 hr. and then using again...although it is probably not good for the battery, you can do it if you need to."
1,Another Worthless Product From Eero,"Eero has continual avoided complaints of its customers regarding all its beds. I myself have purchased over the last 5 years, about 10 Eero beds for use in a small hut and with all of them, I have had problems. This is very inconvenient for me considering I'm blind and live nowhere near a post office. This bed leaks as soon as it is put on the floor. Be warned."
4,Katrina mattresses,"I ordered a number of these air mattresses to be sent to a church shelterfor Katrina victims. I can say only that they were gratefully received.As the very earth seems to be collapsing, there will probably be increasedneed for mattresses like these. They work. They help.I would only hope Amazon would ship all disaster-related purchases at nocost. One could do more/buy more for those in need. I would then ratethe item & Amazon a solid 5."
5,highly recommended,"I borrowed one from a friend a while ago and wanted one of my own ever since. The bed is comfortable and holds air for weeks; the pump is easy to operate. reasonably priced, and when on sale at Amazon - cheap."
4,Aero Sport Bed,"Aero sport bed works great for the kids (ages 7 and 10). I have two beds...one for each girl. I have only had the beds for a couple of months and have used them 3 or 4 times. So far, no leaks."
4,Excellent Bed --lasted about 40 nights,"I have to give the AeroBed a good review, since it is so very comfortable. I've used it about 40 times in the two years I've owned it. About mid-way through its life it developed a slow leak. Eventually, it completely failed. I replaced it with the company's Durabed, hoping for a longer service life.I think there are two ways to go with this product. Either buy the inexpensive $60.00 version and be willing to replace it as needed, or try the more durable version for about three times the price."
4,"Comfy, a little low, stable and inflates quickly.","I took this to a film festival in the country, while camping. It was great, the only thing, if you're gonna use it camping, have a sleeping bag, it was too cold with sheets and blankets; it doesn't insulate against cold from the ground."
1,Inconvenient charger -- customer service unhelpful,"Nowhere on the outside packaging or above description does it tell you that the pump needs a full 24 HOURS to charge before inflating, and there is no A/C adapter to just inflate directly from an outlet! We have guests arriving TONIGHT and I can't inflate our mattress...this is very inconvenient!!! Customer service at Aerobed was not sympathetic, though at this point what can they do. With a photo right on the front of the box of a pump with a plug, it seemed to imply that one could just PLUG THE PUMP IN and use it. They should be more clear in their packaging and description. I wish I could tell you about the comfort of the bed itself, but I need to figure out a way to inflate it first!"
1,Buy a different one to use indoors,"If you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed...DON'T!I have two areobeds; I bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out. The pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it. Fifteen years later it still works like a charm. I liked it so much; I recently bought a Minute bed because I needed another guest bed. It does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours. Needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa. The battery is NiCad, which means it develops a memory, so now even if I remembered to charge it the day before, it does not run long enough to inflate the bed. They do not offer a separate electric, detachable pump, so now I'm stuck with a ""plastic carpet"" that cannot be inflated with anything else. The areobeds work great, but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion, buy a different type."
3,"right apron, wrong color","the apron appears to be very well made. I ordered 2 aprons at the same time, both gifts. They arrived seperatley and when the spice apron came, it was labeled spice but it was celadon. I needed it as a gift, so I wasn't able to take the time and trouble to return it. I really had doped for the spice, but oh, well"
5,No one sounds like this.,Anyone willing to try something decidely out of the ordinary should consider this or any other Third Eye Foundation release. This CD is particularly interesting as it finds Matt Elliott deconstructing songs from bands like Tarwater and Blonde Redhead. Wonderful.
5,Next Great Heroin,"I picked this book up by chance 3 days ago, to say it is a must read for those who like naval action is a gross understatement. Slightly futuristic but solid. Amanda makes a great captain. The other characters are also very appealing. I just picked up his 2nd book in the series Sea Strike. I am very excited about it, as I have already pre-ordered Sea Fighter as well. Do yourself a favor, if you like authors such as Clive Cussler, Michael Demercurio, Dale Brown, you will love James Cobb."
2,A Dime Store Novel,"This is a classic dime store novel and shouldn't dare be compared with Clancy or Brown. The plot is predictable and anyone with a Navy background will laugh at this ""supership"". On the other hand, it is a quick summer read so if you've run out of books to read, you may want to borrow this from the library."
5,Excellent!,"This is most definatley the best book i have ever read, rating right up there with Tom Clancy and others like that. The Subplots are a great added touch"
3,MGM forgot something essential ...,"I`ll be very short and this is in regards for the quality of the dvd, not the great movie. MGM simply managed to blew it. this is 2002. release and they somehow forgot to make it enhanced for 16:9 TVs. shame on them. the 3 rating is there just as I had to put something."
2,not what i expected,"I was disappointed in the movie, ""A Hired Heart"" because, although it had the potential of being a cute romantic comedy, it did not pass my test. I am on the lookout for romantic comedies and romances which do not have language or sensuality in them. I read the reviews and was mistakenly led to believe this was an innocent love story...one I could share with my teenage kids or my close friends. But the sex scene, the foul language, and the message of using a person for gain, was not appealing to me, and I will probably not loan it out to others. I will stick to Love Comes Softly, Love's Enduring Promise, Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow), and The Inheritance (with Meredith Baxter Birney) any time, over this. Sorry!"
1,The disappointed heart,"I loved ""Love Comes Softly"", and when I saw that this was recommended for those who liked that movie, I bought this one. ""The Hired Heart"" did not have the morals or spirituality of ""Love Comes Softly"". There was also bad language, which was not present in the other movie. For anyone looking for a movie without language and pre-marital sex, this is not it. The story was good enough to stand on its own without adding the language and immorality."
1,Wished I'd rented instead of bought!,"I sure wished I'd rented this movie instead of bought it! It went right into the garbage after watching it. It was typical of what clueless men would think a women would want to watch. It was extrememly predictable. A lonely woman rents a man to satisfy her friends, family and acquaintenses that she has a man in her life. It quickly turns from platonic to lust without the characters at least getting to know each other well. . .just another movie with empty, meaningless sex. I found it stupid and offensive. No plot at all unless you consider a woman finding someone to satisfy her lonliness at the risk of her own self respect a plot. Give me a well written classic any day. This movie stays in the trash."
4,Therapeutic,"My husband and I first saw this movie on TV and thoroughly enjoyed it. We kept wishing we could see it again, so we ordered it and are glad we did. There's just enough beautiful country, just enough romance, and just enough ""family"" to make the movie keep our interest and help us relax from a sometimes pressured and busy day. I guess we would call this movie ""therapeutic."""
5,A feast for the hopless romantic ! a man's view,"WOW !A wonderful love story!IT'S right up there with the best romantic comedies! I agree wIth the other reviewers(except for one, who is ashamed of the female's need for a man)Make no misstake the writer was right on target with THIS one.IF you have ever had a broken heart you will feel the emotions of both characters...to be loved and to give love, is without a doubt lifes greatest gift!! this is a MUST have dvd for your collection ,next to ghost,sleepless in seattle,forget paris,the love letter,when harry met sally,straight from the heart etc."
1,Yuck,"I cannot believe I was recomended this because I rated Love's Enduring Promise (which is decent, moral, Christian movie). I read only part of the first customer reveiw, and it sounds really, really sick. Amazon.com: take a clue. I appreciate your services, and I expect that you won't try to sell me anything else of this type. Zero stars. I would not reccomend this to anyone."
5,Absorbing reading,"A thoroughly enjoyable novel, with many challenging themes which twist in and out of the story line. The author obviously has done a lot of research: or observed 9/11 from not too far away. The theme of twins, the theme of incest, the theme of the attacks on the buildings are interwoven with great skill. The main character has a healthy disregard for the pious mouthings of the (un-named) US President and this alone gets full marks from me. But there is much to admire here - I have mentioned only a few aspects of the narrative. I will certainly be seeking out her other works."
2,Boring,"Wow, after 3 awesome CDs this is quite a let down -- don't mind the reflective mood but the songs are just not good. No melody just b-o-r-i-n-g! Luckily her next release ""Jann Arden"" is a step in the right direction but still not the equal to the terrific earlier releases. Hope the next one is better."
5,AWESOME!!AWESOME!!AWESOME!!,"Well what more can I say but this is the most amazing cd that I have had the chance to listen to. It's another great one from jann, although I think that it truly is her best because it comes totally from her heart. she had to learn to trust herself and I'm glad she did. I Was quite impressed by the way she chose to lay the entire cd out as a whole. From the envelope like booklet with words and notes from jann, to the individual cards it was all great. As for the music, it's simply the best, relaxing and personal while still making you think. Jann Arden is simply the best canadian artist we have out there in all aspects. Buy this cd and u won't be dissapointed."
3,PDF Available for Free on the World Bank Site,Something seems wrong about charging for world bank content that is already available for free to the public. Perhaps its not intended to be available there... I don't know. [...]Original publication was July 2000.
5,Awesome!,"If you put the veggies in a single layer, it makes enough to serve 1-4 people. Works great. Cleans easy. And you can't really tell from the picture but the veggies don't touch the water, which is perfect. And if you take the basket out, you have a lidded container for serving and storing the veggies. Like a previous review said, veggies cook in about 8 minutes. Keep that in mind because it doesn't come with instructions, which I think is the one problem with this. If you intend to give it as a gift, your gift recipient might be clueless on how to use it. But I just love it!"
5,Adorable!,"I choose this pattern after days and hours of searching for the ""perfect"" bedset for my baby boy's ocean/sea nursery. I kept coming back to this pattern, so I finally broke down and ordered it. While I thought it was very cute from the pictures online, I was even more excited to receive it! It is everything I wanted and more. The quilt is beautiful and gives the look of ""water"" with soft texture on the whales. I love the yellow and blue colors together. I'm so excited to put the nursery together and await my little boy, coming in Feb. Great buy!"
5,Great Product BUT Beware of Your Crib Design!,"We love the whaley whale bedding. The quilting done on it is so interesting. You can't really tell this in the picture, but the soft fabric is sewn so it looks like there are waves running through the water background. My daughter really likes the feel of the bumper.The one problem we found was that the ties on the bottom and top of the bumper do not hold it onto our crib very well. I had to snip the bottom ties and hand sew them onto the top between the existing tie lines in order to make it fit our crib better. Even with this tiny alteration, I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. It's extremely cute, and I think it works well for babies of any gender."
4,"Expensive, expensive, expensive","This is too expensive for a ordenary crib set, I wouldn't pay anything more than may be $80 at the most. My wife has to have it, so here it is. Not the best of the quality control, string hanging from all over the place. Again Over priced"
1,"bouncy, soft and slow","My local skate shop recommended these wheels for cruising, but, unfortunately, they're very slow, even with new brand new bearings. For sidewalk cruising, I much prefer my 68mm Powell cruising bombers (86a). Maybe I'm not used to riding wheels this soft, but the Bombers are much faster, and still very grippy and smooth."
3,Good if not great,"Dao has many great moments but seems to move along very slowly with little variety. Dao has been compared to Love Supreme and Meditations but for me it doesn't work on that level. Shipp seems out of place but Parker is, as usual, very strong."
4,Looking & Feeling Great,Very good quality products. I see and feel the difference in my face -- no more dry and patchy spots. My face is smooth all over!Con: boo! for glass bottles!! My cleanser fell and shattered in the shower! There goes 30+ down the drain -- I wasn't even half way through the bottle.
1,Pitiful,"This ""Diary"" was not written by Margaretha Zelle aka Mata Hari it's not even a diary it's just the pornographic fantasy of an unnamed writer.This was a huge dissapointment I would give it no stars if the option existed"
1,Really Awful,"When i read the first two reviews i was curious to see if the book was really as bad as they said, so I ordered the free sample for my kindle. I wish I hadn't. I can't unread what I have read, which is an eroticised depiction of a girl being molested by an older girl. I deleted the free sample. This book is nauseating."
3,Alice in fractal wonderland and through the chaos worm hole!,Dr. Pickover is a master fractal and chaos writer and tries to reach a wider public with this book. I would say that he is better on plot than on dialog and the connection between the beautiful frcatal trajectories and the plot development is pretty stretched. His heart is in the right place: I think he is the model for Dr. Malcom in the Jurassic Park movies! But he can't bring this one down to a point where you can live with the characters. Buy it for the pictures and the programs. Your unique Associates ID is: thefractaltransl.
1,dont waste your money,dont waste your money on this... go for an msd coil (only 10 $ more)it lasted less than 1 year in a weekend only jeep
2,Did not work for me,"This was my first experience with Robert Walker and I'm unimpressed. Bitter Instinct has numerous redundant passages and bogs down with too much introspection right from the beginning. The formatting on the kindle also inexplicably has several unnecessarily hyphenated words, which I found distracting. I only made it through about 10% before I couldn't take it anymore. At only $3, I guess I got what I paid for."
3,A good read but something's missing,"I picked this up because the blurbs said it was similar to another author noted for her strong female character Kay Scarpetta. Oh how I miss that. I didn't find exactly what I was looking for but it was a good read. Me, I'm hooked on forensic science and even enjoy Johanson's Eve Duncan which she hasn't written more of, drat.Walker was OK, a fair substitute until something better comes along. The surprise suspect and killer wasn't known thru much of the book, and I was surprised at the revelation, but the plot did seem to drag. Whose poetry did he use?"
4,This instinct is very bitter indeed!,"I have throughly enjoyed the instinct series so far. This latest novel is no exception. Jessica is in London, looking for a vicious killer, no surprise there, however, JT gets left behind on an interesting John Doe case. The tattooed man has no identity, only his tattoos, which JT tries to track him down on. This time, we don't know the identity of the killer and this makes the story much more thrilling. A real whodunit! I can't wait for the next one!Thanks for reading!**Pandora"
2,Wait for the next one!!,"If you have been anxiously awaiting this Jessica Coran novel as I have, just skip over it and wait for the next one. This storyline was not even close to the previous Jessica Coran ""Instinct"" novels. It was, frankly, boring. Too much gibberish about poetry and not enough forensic details as all of the other stories in the past have had. I read these novels for the terrific medical/forensic details, hard-hitting detective work, and the gripping suspense that usually keep me guessing until the very end. This novel should be non-fiction based on all that I learned about the poets and poetry of the modern and pre-modern world.Take my advice, as a huge fan of Robert Walker, wait for the next installment in the Instinct series (hopefully there is one) and hope also that it is much, much better than this one."
3,"Well written, poorly formatted","I have enjoyed R.Walkers stories, his characters are engaging and plots well thought out. Unfortunately the formatting gets in the way. Throughout the text there are hyphenated words, most if not all of these words shouldn't be hyphenated. The problem is pervasive and definitely detracts from the story. Usually I tend to take formatting and minor grammatical errors in stride and without comment but unfortunately these detract to much from an otherwise good story. The other ""Instinct"" books didn't have this issue. I am using a Kindle app on an android device ( Acer running I.C.S. ) I really don't think that this is the issue nor is it a hidden message incorporating the different word groups or Morse code. This aside it is an excellent series and an author worth reading."
1,Stinky writer,"I can't believe this guy got published. His writing is fragmented, disjointed. His character development is poor. Yuck! How can anyone say he's better than . . ."
2,"serial killers can be dull, too","This novel got less and less interesting the closer I got to the end, the exact opposite of what a crime novelist should be trying to achieve. I think the main problem is the way he deals with the serial killer-- with the author trying to keep his identity a secret, we never really get to know the charismatic psychopath, and he remains a background character, an enigma.Second is the way the crimes are committed themselves. That so many people would willingly let someone carve poems into their flesh, even after the bodies begin to pile up, is ludicrous.There are other problems, too: too little forensic or investigative detail, characters that are caricatures, etc. I read his first four or five Jessica Coran novels, and this is a big disappointment compared with those early efforts."
1,Stinko,"This movie stinks. It is about a crippled Vietnam vet who turns Jane Fonda into a cheater. He rolls around her house in his wheelchair with his shirt off and it makes Jane get wet and slushy all over.The part I like best about this garbage is when Jane's husband comes home and blows the creep away with a shotgun hole in the middle of his exposed chest. That part is really cool. Unfortunately, it was left out of the version I saw, so there are no saving graces to this film at all.It ends with the cheated-upon husband running into the sea with his backside jiggling. Thank you for that unforgettable junk.Jane is as wooden as a soup ladle."
5,Powerful,"Can't get any better than this...From cast to script...Coming Home recalls the confusion and feelings we shared during the tumultuous Vietnam era. The music soundtrack is awesome...and Fonda, Voight, Dern and Ashby nail there perspective with class and dignity."
5,Symptoms: The Complete Home Medical Encyclopedia,"This is an excellent resource manual. I'm a surgical nurse with 18 years experience and, though my copy is 25 years old, I continue to refer to it often. Its format is exceptional..."
5,very informative and Understandable,"I have used this book since 1980. Reference material can be looked up by the symtoms you are having or by the disease. Information has always helped me. When I started having children is was better than Dr. Spocks book. Now 2001, wish he had a recent one with the new medical information out there."
2,Not for you,This book tells you that is almost imposible to do architectural photography without a view camera. If you are thinking of becoming an architectural photographer and you don't have the money to get a view camera this book is not for you. I am working with an excellent professional architectural photographer who does most of his asignments in digital photography. This book gives you very little information regarding to that. Not a source of inspiration for me.JC
1,Incorrect advertising,"These guides are advertised as being in inch dimensions. If that's important to you - for accurate template offsets, for example - pass these up. All have millimeter OD's. None are the fractional inches shown. I'm returning them unused as being useless for my purposes."
5,"Priced right, is exactly as expected","This product is exactly as described. The price is very good, and I can only presume it is partially due to the no frills packaging that it comes in. I for one, do not appreciate all of these fancy boxes that items like this tend to come in. For me it is a waist of space, I already have storage cabinets and drawers dedicated to storage, so if I can save a couple of dollars by not paying for fancier packaging, which I won't use, and will ultimately be stored some place out of the way until I go on a cleaning bing, then that is the best choice for me."
4,Thrifty buy,Brass lock rings are very tight...actually tightened more as I used them. Bushings are good quality but I wish they were better marked (sizes) and not quite as deep.
2,Needs better labelling.,"This is a *hard* to use set of template guides. Since there's no container and the guides themselves aren't marked, it's hard to get the right size one when you need it (or know what sizes you have). Spend a little more and get a set with a case, or spend some time to build a case you can easily use to identify which is which."
3,Router template guides,Worked fine for awhile but vibrated loose. Had to retighten it twice. Once it came loose it broke the router bit slightly.
1,A very bad LP,"Unfortunately, I'm probably the only person who owns this terrible CD. ... the album is awful."
4,What I was looking for,"Based on the reviews that I has read earlier, I was expecting a fast response and quick delivery. I got just what I expected. The book is in excellent condition and the package came a quickly as it could. Trust me, this is the way to go. The seller has to be an honest person and person of their word."
3,Zimbardo,"That guy is crazy. Since taking this class I have lost everything. I'm living in a sandcastle. But, this book, is good for warmth."
5,Sure,The item was as described. A loose leaf text book. The condition was fair and I got what I paid for.
3,Psychology text book,"The book arrived on time and was in new condition. My only complaint is the psych lab, no code was included. So, I had to purchase the code to use the online psych lab seperately. This elimated my savings by shopping online. I could have done as well buying at the college bookstore."
1,poor packaging,"When I received the book from the postman the flimsy brown paper was all torn and the top and sides of the book was exposed. Do not know the original condition of the book because of this. The top right corners were all folded over and corner of cover was torn off. The book was still useable, however my son said it looked like it went thru the war. Will not order from amazon again an expensive collage book and will not recommend it to anyone either.Postman said shipper could of packaged much better...."
1,Deceptively advertised,"I needed the book to include MyPsychLab access code. I purchased this because I thought (MyPsychLab Series) meant that.So, I ended up having to go to Pearson and purchasing the access code for $30. I would have been better just getting this at the college book store.Other than this misunderstanding, the transaction was quick and painless. It arrived perfectly."
2,confusing and disjointed but somewhat informative,"THis book was used for my into to psycho class at a large university, and I really wish they would have picked a different text. The book has a hard time staying focused, in one section concepts are horibbly oversimplified, in another, they are throwing too much high level information with no context. The chapter questions were ridiculously easy at times, unanwerable even by my TA at others. All in all, a very disjointed text."
3,Did not receive access code with the new book,"I purchased the book new from Amazon so that I would have the MyPsychLab access code that is supposed to come with all new books. Since I did not receive it, I am missing a lot of material in my class. The publisher answered my email that the book needs to be purchased from them or a university in order to receive the code, but others in my class bought new volumes from the university and did not receive it either. Amazon has not answered my email to see what can be done to get the code."
1,not complete,"I was very dissappointed with this book purchase, the state of the book I have no complaints with but this book was supposed to come with a code to access the internet and do a psychology lab. there was no code anywhere and I could not contact the sender for questions. due to the need and shortage of time (class started already) I had to buy the the code through the internet which defeats the purpose of getting a good buy with amazon."
4,Love this textbook,"I find it interesting, and entertaining to read! Because this is an introductory book and has to include a lot of the basic key information about Psychology, it's pretty concise and not much depth. But I absolutely love reading it."
1,The Truth About This Book,"I have researched this book so intensely that it would take far too much room here to express my opinion. While I do not wish to be too negative, I found that the book did not present a balanced view of the study of the mind and human behaviour, and certainly did not back up its claims, nor show the complete truth about several things. To get a more extensive review, you are welcome to go here: http://wisdomfromtheword.blogspot.com/The name of the site is ""Psychology: Core Concepts, Fifth Edition."" I have attempted to show another side that was not revealed in this book. The price of the book was not worth the information contained in it, but it was just my opinion, and in writing this, I am only trying to give the student a more fair and balanced view than the book itself did."
5,Wonderful!,"Christmas gift for my daughter and we BOTH loved it!! Funny, clean, family fun brought back lots of memories of the show. Enjoyed the conversations with Carol and the cast as well. Video was everything it purported to be."
2,Virtually nothing new,"I was thrilled when months ago I learned TimeLife would be releasing The Carol Burnett Show and was prepared to buy every disk available. But after further research on the TimeLife website, I realized an ENORMOUS number of the episodes were identical to those already released by Columbia House and Gunther-Renky(sp.)...very disappointing. I will not spend money on virtually duplicate DVDs merely for a chance to own a few new episodes and a sprinkling of bonus material. I can only hope TimeLife decides to release the DVDs individually so I can invest less money trying to collect episodes I do not already own.Hint: For those who years ago purchased the VHS episodes of The Carol Burnett Show from Columbia, please know these VHS tapes were not copyright protected so they can be easilyconverted to DVD & will last years longer than VHS tapes."
2,Poor Quality,"DVD's vibrate very loudly, tried them in 2 different DVD players with same result. Returned dvd's and replacement dvd's had same problem. Returning to Amazon.com for a full refund."
4,CAROL BURNETT DVD,"GREAT SET OF DVDS FROM THE ORIGINAL TV SHOWS. A GOOD GIFT FOR ANYONE WHO WATCHED THE ORIGINAL AIRINGS. IT CREATES NOSTALGIA AND A FEW TEARS, BUT IS VERY ENJOYABLE."
3,A little disappointed,Carol's favorites were not all my favorites. But some were. Don't really enjoy all of the singing but like the comedy better.
5,Carol Burnett DVD Carol's Favorites,Brings back all the memories I had as a child watching these episodes when they were on TV. The best of the best.
2,So-So,Not as good as I thought it would be---could have been better since the original show were great but only have watched 1 disc
4,Carol Burnett,Good collection cd seems to black out once in a while playing have never had that problem with my blue ray player before
5,Carol Burnetts new DVD,"This is a great DVD. Its a DVD for the whole family to watch! We miss you Carol Burnett, you had the best show on TV. Its great to know that these segments of the show are your favorites! I highly recommend it!"
4,Carol Burnett (Collecyots Edition),Found this series to be as fresh as when I saw it years ago. The quality is what I expected.
2,The skits are really funny but------,"The skits, that are advertised on TV, are really funny. However these Advertised skits are overpowered in the full shows by the long stretches of taking questions from the audience, and long boring musical/dance segments. My family and I put the collection away after the first two shows. I would not recommend the full version shows to anyone."
4,"Fun, didn't realize these have the WHOLE shows.","Realized after we got this that we were mostly anticipating the humorous skits. Forgot about the monologues, singing etc. in the shows. But those are fun too. I didn't get to watch much tv as a kid so now I'm learning what I missed, besides the hilarious skits."
2,"I watched it once, probably not again","These are Carol's favorites? They are not mine. There is at least the ""Went with the Wind"" sketch. But I can think of so many other sketches that were much funnier than the ones on these discs. Does anyone remember the Snow White sketch? She was Snow White after 30 years of marriage to Prince Charming (Harvey Korman) and Lyle Waggoner was the Mirror who kept making rude comments about her? That was much funnier than the skits on here. I'm sorry Carol, but I do not recommend this set."
2,Disappointed,Too much singing and not enough skits. This was a gift and the receiver was happy with it but I got bored.
2,The Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites (Collectors Edition),"It was boring, It wasn't what I expected. I thought it would show the best skits, not the entire weekly programs."
5,The that TV can Be: Carol Burnett,"Love this dvd. Laughed till I cried at Mama, Mrs Wiggins, As the Stomach Turns and Went with the Wind, and everything else. I could watch Carol go for the doorbell before it rings 9 million times and laugh every time. It's so great to be able to show my kids terrific comedy and music and not feel like I need to screen it first for ""mature"" content. It's so clear that Carol, Tim, Vicki, Lyle and Harvey are having a terrific time and that makes it all the more fun to watch.This dvd set is a terrific value because my kids love it and I love it. So each disc will get well worn in the player!!!"
5,How could this be anything BUT five stars?,"Comedy isn't what it used to be. Carol Burnett and her faithfuls could make us laugh until the tears run down without profanity, insulting anyone but themselves, or any other form of today's crass humor. We invite friends over to watch sections of it and have a great time. If the younger generation wants to know what innocent humor and laughter is all about, this is an excellent -- and classic -- example."
2,Talk about dated.,"Ok, so here it is: I am a fan of Carol Burnett and her show. Or so I thought. I admit that I may have been ill-informed. What DID I know before I bought this DVD? Various clips from you tube from sketches that had gone off the deep end when her actors went off script. VERY funny. Side-splittingly funny! So I bought this DVD as a gift to my husband and we started watching it... and turned it off after 1 hour. I am sorry to say that time wasn't kind. A serious throwback to the 70s as far as the humor goes. All those cracks at marriage and women that usually only old men make any more these days. Different times back then for sure.What was funny? Watching the audience's 70's hairdos and clothes and then squirming at their planted questions to Carol. If that amuses you buy the CD. If you want 'funny' stick to the you tube excerpts."
4,"Sounds great, but badly want to know if Cher is anywhere on","This sounds great- I just have the 1 disc DVD. I am very, very much wanting to know if Cher is anywhere on one of these discs?"
5,A long-time Carol Burnett fan,"I have been a Carol Burnett fan since the 1960's. With or without the presence of her supporting cast, she brightened up a TV screen.To avoid what passes today as ""comedy"", I highly recommend this collection of her favorites."
5,What fun,"This was a hit. Gave this video collection to my husband for Christmas this year. We invited his parents over and watched with 3 generations of our family for an evening full of laughs. It entertained everyone with belly laughs from my nearly 80 year old father in law to my 10 year old son. Carol and her gang of big name co hosts like Vicky Lawrence, Betty White and Tim Conway keep the belly laughs rolling."
5,Mom loves it!,"My mom, age 82, ask for this video for Christmas.. She loves it! Brings back great memories and laughing is wonderful for staying young."
2,Not Funny,Wasn't as good as I expected. The shows that were shown weren't that funny. And I know she is great!
4,A real classic.,"Carol and her co-stars (Vicki, Tim, & Harvey) were one of the greatest comedy teams ever assembled, and it's so awesome that they can be THAT funny without being raunchy."
5,My wife loved her birthday present,We enjoy watching Carol Burnett over and over again and again and again and again and again and again and again!
4,Great Product & Great price,"This set of DVD's will not read on a HD DVD player. Otherwise, thequality and sound is great. The audio is not as good as it could be."
1,Carol's favorites.,When we ordr this we thought we were getting additional shows that were not on the 7DVD collection that we also ordered. We returned it for credit yesterday..
4,Don't really know yet!,"Haven't had an opportunity to watch it yet, but as Carol Burnett fans - I'm certain it will be great."
3,not what it was hyped up to be...,just not what I expected..very slow...none of the hilarious highlights I remember...kind of a let down to me...
2,not what I expected,"I am a little disappointed in the product. It was advertised as great...it is not...but since I love the Carol Burnett Shows, I will keep it."
2,Marketing Ploy,"In plain and simple terms they are mixing and matching episodes forcing the continued purchasing to view the 'best of the best.' Will not purchase anymore of the collection. Marketing managers and Carol Burnett need to spend many hours reviewing and combining the very best in a set, and with their experience and knowledge of show business I would think it could easily be done."
3,My dad's a pain in the ducas.,Gift for Dad whom refuses to learn how to use the dvd player!! Otherwise I'm sure it was fine and dandy.
3,memories,I haven't watched it all yet. I wanted my girls to see some of these episodes. They are great for skit ideas.
5,Awesome,Fun to reminisce with Carol and friends! Awesome collection of videos really enjoyed it a lot. Must buy for CB fans everywhere
3,Just okay,"Am still in the process of watching all the DVDs. So far, I've been a little underwhelmed at the choices of her favorite episodes.I am a huge fan of Carol and her shows.I assumed I would put in the first one and not want to stop watching until I got through all of them. So far, not enough ""Tim"" and not enough funny skits. Several serious ones and too much Roddy McDowell and Nancy Walker and apparent friends of Carol's. Of course, this is labeled her favorites...just not a lot of mine. Still enjoying it, but not like I thought I would. I've got one more disc to watch and I hope the clips picked are funnier.I'll do another review, once I get all the way through.The discs have 2 or 3 partial shows on each one. There could have been a lot more included, or at least the entire show.It does show the opening where she takes questions from the audience. Those are very entertaining. It's also nice to see all the beautiful gowns Bob Mackey created for her.I'm still glad I purchased it."
2,No Closed Captions!,"If you're deaf/hard of hearing, or you're thinking of getting this for someone who is, be aware that Time Life chose to ignore up to 40% of the likely demographic for this series and not provide Closed Captions. I'm glad I wrote them and asked before ordering!"
3,"Fine for what it is, but...","This isn't the best book of survival tips. Better offerings range from a US military guide (including one edition with a foreward by Survivor producer Mark Burnett) to a few offerings about radically unusual situations (what to do in a hostage crisis, or if you're bitten by a crocodile, etc.) Nonetheless, it's a fine sampling of tips for situations that you might (but probably won't) find yourself in.Howevever, it's terribly misrepresented, on its cover and on this page. The font for the title, the use of the word ""castaway"" (a term used on CBS's Survivor), the coastal photograph (alluding to most seasons of Survivor, but to only a limited number of situations in the book), and the sales offerings (such as getting this plus Spoiler, about someone who regularly predicted Survivor happenings in advance) all suggest or imply that this book has ANYTHING to do with that reality show.It doesn't."
4,Helpful Survial Techniques,"The book was interesting enough and provided useful facts. I would hope I have the book with me if I become a castaway! Mr. Storm writes the book with childern in mind, keeping the survial world simple. I would recommend it for any young Scout, camping or hiking enthusiast."
4,Scots are Go!,"I tracked this down because I'd read and loved Legge's short story ""Pop Life"" in the Children of Albion Rovers collection. Here, he really emphasizes the short side of things, as 33 stories are crammed into 152 pages. Ranging from a half page to twelve pages, the stories are full-on Scot-centric. In general, the longer the story was, the more I liked it. If you want to sample a novel of his, try The Shoe."
3,Fresh air!,"For anyone sick of the monotony of ""Contemporary Christian"" radio should try this album. Soul Junk sound like a lo-fi version of Sonic Youth, a more melodic version of the Dead C, or Silage playing free jazz. Actually lead singer Glenn Galaxy was in the jazz-punk band Truman's Water before he started his own Christian ensemble. Almost all of the lyrics are straight scripture reading, which gets old after a while (I wanted to hear one, just one lne that rhymed!), but Glenn Galaxy's delivery, from screaming his head off to rapping at times, makes it interesting enough. With the exception of their friends in Danielson, these guys are one of the only admittantly Christian bands out there pushing the envelope. Only for the open-eared listener. Keep watching these guys."
1,This is wearing on me,"I wrote the below review a few months ago, and I really haven't listened to Soul Junk much since. I start to play it and I can't get farther than 3 or 4 songs before I have to turn the thing off! It sounds so grating and forced, and I realize now that it was not a lo-fi production, but rather, and incompetant production. This CD makes me want to throw up. Yes it is different, and if that's all you're looking for than try this record. Otherwise, steer clear."
3,A movie in waiting?,"The Psychic is a fairly interesting read, though it is a little cliched and seems to be have been written with one eye on the movie industry. Give it to your kid brother for xmas, if you cant afford what he really wants."
5,Lego never failed me,"If you read my reviews about the Lego products, you will see that I repeated my self on all of them, and that is because these people never fail to amaze me with new product lines. City line is for youngsters ( I bought it to a 7 y/o). He is having fun with it, and I think I won't be having trouble finding a gift for any coming occasions. People please believe me when I tell you, that I played with legos when I was young, and now my both boys are playing with their products too... Do Not Buy Another Building Products Other Than LEGO."
3,Ladder needs work,"This toy looks great when assembled and the the accessories for the Firemen are great (air mask and pack, etc.). However, the ladder construction needs work. It constantly falls apart. We finally had to take off the ladder and play without it. Lego needs to redesign this part, otherwise, a great fire truck."
2,too fragile to play with,"My son received the firetruck, 7239, set for ages 5+ for Christmas. It is fair that he needed help putting it together as he is young. However, we are all disappointed that once put together, it is VERY FRAGILE and falls apart practically when anyone looks at it, let alone touches it. If we try to pick it up, something is sure to fall off. It is cool because it has a lot of features, but what good are they if playing with it is more frustrating than fun??? It is not just because he is small (almost 5 years). Even when adults play with it, it falls apart. For the price and reputation of LEGO products, I find this unacceptable. We have other lego products that do not have this problem, so it seems to me that this is a bad design. The sad thing is that he was most excited about this gift and it has turned out to be a real letdown."
1,Frustrating,There are only 2 figurines not 3 as advertised. I hate this toy. I spend more time putting it back together than my son plays with it. It is in a constant state of falling apart. The ladder of the boom is not properly counter balanced and breaks off every time my son touches the ladder. I bought this toy explicitly for the moving boom and ladder. I actually tried to crazy glue it this morning (only opened this toy yesterday) out of frustration. Now the truck falls apart at a weaker point. Poor construction and not sure why it has such high ratings. Save yourself some time and frustration and buy something else.
5,Lego Fire Truck,"I purchased this Lego kit as a gift for a 4 year old boy. Legos are soooo great for hours of entertainment. My daughter's school actually has a Lego club, put together because the children expressed such a great interest. They are great for hours of creative play. I don't think you can go wrong with any product Lego puts out."
4,DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE,"THIS TOY IS VERY GOOD BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER, IT TOOK GROWN UPS HOURS TOASSEMBLE A NICE TOY BUT DEFINITELY NOT FOR A 5 YEAR OLD. ONCE ASSEMBLED IT IS VERYDETAILED AND NICE."
4,Another Excellent LEGO Set,Lots of great parts in this set. My sons especially love the small fire boat and the extendable ladder. Great possibilities for play and imagination.
3,Best option for limited selection.,"I got these for a figure competition. I needed 5 inch clear heels and I couldn't find a huge variety. The plastic top isn't super comfortable (not that I expected it to be), but the bottom of the shoes do have a nice little cushion. They look a little cheap..but I also expected that. They are clear heels, after all. SO, pretty much met my expectations, the price wasn't too bad and they look exactly as they do in the image."
4,Great!,"These will be stage shoes for me and they're perfect, minus one small thing... The ankle strap is very loose when I strap it even to the smallest hole. I'm high maintenance and believe that if I buy a shoe, it should come correctly made. I don't like having to adjust shoes myself, so making a new hole was kinda irritating. But they are great and secure once I did."
2,Not Like The Picture,"I just got my shoes two days ago and I have to return them. They don't look like the picture at all. The shoe is very pointed in the front, the clear strap dosen't cover any of your toes at all because it's so high up on your foot...you have the clear strap that goes around your ankle and then like right under it is the other thick strap. You see how in the picture some of her toes are coverd by the shoe,the shoes I got arn't like that, every single toe is all the way out..even my little pinky toe,it's all out. It's hard to really describe but it seems like they made the shoe wrong or something because the design dosen't make sense. I don't like the shoe and it wouldn't be such an issue if the shoe was the same as the picture but it's a whole different shoe and I hate it. Grrrr SO UGLY"
4,A Fascinating Man,"I enjoyed the extras more than the movie. The documentary where Allen Baron breathlessly spoke about his unheralded film in 1990 and 2006 tied it all together for me. I believe the film itself is something I wouldn't have stayed with for long while channel surfing. I found this at the library and the scenario described on the case sounded too interesting to pass up. Beautifully shot and good acting despite the budget, it reminds me of The Hustler or Taxi Driver. Nearly every character in it could be taken as a loser. Frank Bono seems be unhappy in both possible futures: loner assassin or married architect. He could have easily been a popular guy if only he'd let friends get near. Big Ralph appears to have a single room apartment full of hamster cages and a bathtub covered with a plank so it can be used as a table.It would be like if Robert DeNiro made a film in 1961 and then never acted again. Only directed. Baron is fascinating!"
4,an forgotten low budget gem returns.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmBlast of Silence is about a hitman on the brink of retirement named Frank Bono (Allen Baron) who is hired to kill a mobster. I don't want to say much else that would spoil the story.This film was made on a very low budget but is well made and has good cinematography. The film's release onto DVD has gotten it many positive reviews in the media.The DVD has good special features also including one I'd like to see more of. There is a making of documentary a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, and my favorite, a comparison of the filming locations as they looked then and how they look today.This is a movie that film enthusiasts will love."
2,Blast of Mediocrity,"This movie has lots of style -- scenes of New York, jazz music, the narration -- but little substance. While potentially interesting, this movie is devoid of any real drama or suspense. Even the actual murders are rather unexciting. The film thus relies on being a character study. Unfortunately, the lead actor is too bland to pull this off successfully. Baron simply doesn't posssess enough emotional range or grit for the role. The most interesting character is Ralph, the gun dealer, but he's in the movie for only about 10 minutes. His chase scene actually provides a few moments of suspense.Overall, most noir fans would be better off renting as there is little repeat value. For a similarly-themed, but far superior film, see Melville's Le Samourai (French) starring Alain Delon, also by Criterion."
5,"if you are a women, get this book",The book has some nice poems and techinques to seduce your man. I would recommend this book to any female who is interested in seducing his man.
3,Primarily about how to use herbicides,"This book depicts quite a few weeds and algae plants typically found in ponds. The photos were fairly helpful; however the means of dealing with controlling problem plants is primarily through the use of herbicides, which we found unacceptable."
2,roy Hobbs jacket,The jacket seems to show buttons in the picture and it has snaps the color of the sleeves is darker the logo seems to be much bigger on the real product.the picture is a much better looking jacket than the real Macoy...sending back
4,"Beautiful, but too narrow.","The quality and the look are great, but they are really in toe area. i normally wear sz 9 and that's what i've ordered. I'm not sure if ordering the bigger size would be such a great idea - the boots are pointy and will look oddly long. The heel is not too high and seem to be really comfortable. i'm thinking about returning them, but maybe i'll reconsider. Anyway, if you have narrow feet ( i have normal) these are definitely boots for you."
3,Quite a reasonably good but not that exciting article on developing a strategist mindset!,"This is not a paperback book, but an article originally published in a strategic communications magazine.The author, being a communications expert, certainly has the knack for telling stories, which he uses very well to illustrates some important aspects of developing the strategist mindset. Because of his professional background, he focuses too much on strategy as one of the important areas of public relations practice. Nevertheless, he does make very clear distinctions between the work of a manager and that of a strategist.On the whole, the article is a reasonably good one, but not that exciting."
1,Fifteen & Pregnant,"It was alright. The movie was not what I was expecting... there are much better movies out there now a days, like To young to be a dad and such."
1,Only for Kirsten,"As the title above says, I saw this movie only for Kirsten Dunst. She brings a certain class to the ""After School Specialness"" of this movie. If you love Kirsten as much as me--you should get this movie, otherwise try somewhere else."
4,Lifetime junkie...,I didn't particularly like or dislike this film...truth be told it was on sale and I bought it to add to my collection of Lifetime movies on DVD.
4,Good Movie On Teen Pregnancy,I purchased this item because I like Kirsten Dunst. I wasn't sure what to expect of the movies but I enjoyed it. It is a good movie ab out teen pregnancy and parenthood and all that goes with it. I recommend this video to younger people thinking of having sex.
4,Fifteen and Pregnant- good Lifetime movie,"I enjoyed this movie, I remember watching it on Lifetime when I was in high school and I was glad I could find it on DVD."
4,Sad But True,"This movie touched on the epidemic of teenage pregnancy. It was realistic and let the viewers know how teenage pregnany not only effects the individual pregnant, but also how it effects the entire family. It was very heart felt, and did not sugar coat an issue that has become quite relevant over the past couple of years."
1,Don't bother,"I read this book a few years ago as part of my Master's degree program in American History. It's the most impenetrable gobbledygook I've ever read; a great example of how too much history is being written for other PhDs, though I doubt if any PhD other than Wilentz understands it. Don't waste your time unless you need further proof that Wilentz in more interested in political grandstanding than writing good history."
4,This film makes me want to learn Cantonese and Mandarin,"Whenever I listen to this, the music really recreates the scenes in my head for me. Especially tracks 12 and 17. This version contains dialogue--I don't speak the language, but the quotes still make me laugh. The only downside is ""The Blade"". Like F. Vernon wrote below, ""The Blade"" doesn't have the sound effects of the swords that really make your heart pump faster when watching the fight sequence.I sprung for the more expensive version of this soundtrack because I really love this film and have seen it maybe five or six times in the last month. The cd booklet contains stills from the film from some of its tender moments (lollipop!) and translations of the quotes."
1,just a small plastic bag,it is not as the picture showed above. It is just a small plastic bag without any English instructions and other words on it...
3,"Interesting Time, Place and People.","Atlantic City was ""THE"" place at one time, The 500 Club was very famous, the people were famous or trying to be. My wife was born (1945) and raised in A.C., her relatives hung out at the club. A better writer with better research could have written a great book, I bought 3 as gifts before I had read it. I should have bought one and passed it around. Van Meter scratched a surface of a jewel, not deeply. I hope another writer can cut and polish a multi-faceted gem out of this subject."
5,All new stuff on ornery Hollywood notables!,"This is great reading!It's a wonderful journey down the nostalgic road back to the endless antics and travels of The Rat Pack (Sinatra, Bishop, Lewis, Martin, Lawford, and Davis, Jr.). Also, you'll find lots of good history on Atlantic City, and, on Joe Dimagio, George Raft, Marilyn Monroe, and many other celebrity notables who lived ""on the fringe.""You'll read all new stuff in here! Well-researched and a real page-turner. My highest recommendation to readers of all interest areas."
3,NOT SAYING MUCH,"For those who have a bunch of Lee's sessions already Lee's solos here may sound a bit redundant. He's not geting enough new ideas from the tunes themselves. With Harper soloing fist much of the time and none of tunes credited to Lee, this session could be mistaken for one of his. If electric piano and the further adventures of Billy Harper are not to your liking, stick to hard bop with Jackie McLean's CONSEQUENCE, Hank Mobley's DIPPIN' and Wayne Shorter's NIGHT DREAMER all with Lee as a sideman."
3,So begins the downward spiral,"This season is not the best. There is no more Mingo, and Jimmy Dean well .... Let's just say he wasn't the best replacement for Mingo. The show still is innocent but the plots have taken a downward turn. Most of them are pretty dumb. So if you are looking for a G show this is a good pick, but if you're after a good show get season three or earlier."
1,Very Disappointed,"This is a great series. I love all six seasons of Daniel Boone. I am a great Fess Parker fan. But the packaging of thes DVDs is horrible. Cheap, brittle plastic. It falls apart in your fingers as if it was made one thousand years ago. Be prepared to make your own case for these DVDs."
2,one bad disc,"the series is great, however; there is one bad disc that wont play and appears to be damaged."
4,daniel boone,I like the Daniel Boone dvds. but not happy because disc # 4 in season 4 was blank. also I got murder she wrote for my Wife at Christmas and the cases where broken.and when I told you this you said you would send good cases to replace the broken ones. I know thangs get damaged but I would like disc 4 in season 4 replaced with a good one and the cases that I was told I would get for the murder she wrote purchuse. But all in all I will probably buy more from you I heve gotten several shows from ya and those are the only 2 problems I have had. thanks stephen Rhodes
1,NOT for the Current Citizenship Test,"This book was published in 2007. The U.S. Citizenship test that is used today was revised the end of 2008.Some other information is also incorrect (including the fees which are much more expensive now).But the most important thing would be to prepare for citizenship with the materials USCIS is using NOW, not with these which are almost 5 years out-of-date."
2,Underwhelming,"With an extremely clunky, unresponsive battle-system and one of the poorest paced and written stories I have seen, this game should not be nearly as revered as it is by its fanbase."
4,Should be 4 1/2!,"An excellent set by Parker's In Order to Survive Quartet. All songs are strong and the playing by Cooper Moore, Rob Brown and Susie Ibarra is excellent. The lower rating is in relation to The Peach Orchard (Aum Fidelity) and Possium Pendasem (FMP)."
4,Classic Read,"I love the cover of this book. Sturdy hard cover with red fabric binding. My 5 1/2 year old enjoyed reading it but was left looking for more at the end. Overall, it is a good classic read."
5,Reno 911,This DVD is great I have all the seasons and they are great and funny spin on our law enforcement officers.
3,Finite math blah,"This was an alright book for finite math. The book did contain real examples (a positive) along with tons of formulas that I'm not sure that I'll ever see again. The probability stuff was good from this book, but some of the explanations were lacking clarity. Some of the topics include: Finance, linear programming of the simplex method and geometric approach, graphs, trees, counting, statistics along with relations and functions."
5,A must for raising a new puppy,"When I brought my puppy home I immediately made every mistake possible. So I found Puppies for Dummies on Amazon, which others had highly recommended, and it really has gotten me through a challenging time...housebreaking, chewing, you name it! The author is very straightforward and her strong recommendations come from years of knowledge about what works and doesn't work with puppies. And guess what? Puppies DO learn and do behave IF you follow her recommendations. Dealing with a new puppy won't be easy no matter what, but read this book or it will just be that much more difficult and take that much longer."
4,Puppy Training for the busy adult,This book was helpful to bring things to my attention and make me look at common puppy issues in a different light. VERY quick read because at least 50% of the book is the diary section. Can't wait to bring home our little pal and put this book to use!!
3,A good starting tool,The book for dummies helped with getting started with my new puppy. She is a hyper dog so I was still lost with what to do when she did not react the way she was supposed to according to the book.
3,Good Quality But.....,Hmmm...I got this set in the polished chrome and I have to say to me it doesn't look nearly as good as the photos. Wish I had gone with something else. The faucet is smaller than I envisioned. I put it on the Memoirs pedestal sink. Maybe it would look better in a different finish.
2,"Wayne, please stick with melodrama and lay off the social commentary","I can completely understand those who feel this is a beautiful and touching film. The acting, pace, mood are good and even affecting.It is the social commentary part that is laughably atrocious. It should be a crime for a film maker to make up historical events like Mr. Wong did in this film; I am referring to the two scenes of student suicide. For those of us who are well informed, the movie just lost all credibility; for those who aren't, it just added more to social and racial prejudice. It is beyond artistic license, it is political propaganda! Why oh why Wayne? To appease certain Westerners' stereotypical view of the Chinese? Simply unforgivable!! Wayne, for your and the world's sake, stick with melodramas please."
3,Could have been a contender,"This is a great love story, but it just doesn't quite make it to rise above average. The story is just a little too tired. However, it is a must see for all Gong Li fans. She is absolutely striking and creates one of the best seduction scenes on film without ever exposing any skin. The main problem is that we just don't get enough of her and as usual, no one as yet has been able to cast a male opposite her with enough strength to really create the great screen love that she needs to make her a superstar. In other words, Irons, while an excellent actor, is more like Leslie Howard, while the viewer longs for Li to find a Clark Gable, ""Soldier of Fortune"", Bogart or Tyrone Power to rescue her."
3,a place called home,"I watched this film by ""accident."" One night I turned on the TV and ""The Chinese Box"" movie was on. I watched it because it is a film about Hong Kong. The story is only average, not too excited but close enough to real life. However, some scenes are unreasonable exaggerated. For instance, two customers drank and talked about the northern girl in a very bad slang. Their attitudes were so rude. They embarrassed Gong Li because she is from the northern part of China. I hope that the audience who watched this film do not have an impression that the Hong Kong people are rude. It is not turth. Generally speaking, most Hong Kong people are polite and conservative. The photographers did a very good job. They successfully depicted the lankmarks of Hong Kong, including the City Hall, The Shanghai and Hong Kong Corporation Banking Headquarter, Mandarin Hotel, Temple Street, Mongkok, Central District, etc."
3,"Not bad overall, but don't expect fireworks.","The Chinese Box is a film that draws parallels between the relationship of Jeremy Irons and Gong Li to that of the Hong Kong handover. It is far from Irons' best performance, and I was dissapointed by Li's miniscule role in the film. Such a wonderful actress could've been given more lines despite her shaky english. Oh, and it was a little slow.Despite all this, the film does manage to draw you in somewhat and you end up caring about what happens to the two character. In the end, it's worth a view... but not twenty dollars."
4,"Slow, but haunting","The three central characters in this film Jeremy Irons (the foreign reporter), Gong Li (the former prostitute), and Maggie Cheung (the scarred street hustler) each represent aspects of the old, Great Britain Hong Kong and new China Hong Kong. I think Gong Li and Maggie Cheung, two great actresses, should have had more screen time.This film was long and slow, lacking the traditional rising action, climax, etc. However, it had a mysterious quality about it that makes it captivating and gave me a worldly feeling. It changes the way you perceive things."
2,Not much bang for the buck,"Despite a first-rate cast, the movie never really delivers. Maggie Cheung is interesting as the waif-like June, but Gong Li and Jeremy Irons just can't connect. In all of their scenes together, I kept wondering whether Gong Li really understood anything that was was being said between the two; and her lines (in english) seemed rather ersatz in nature. If you want to see what Gong Li is really capable of (and she is capable of quite a bit), see ""Ju Do"" or ""Farewell My Concubine."""
2,A Interesting Failure of a Film!,"The idea was there. A film about the change over of Hong Kong from British to PRC rule. The casting was there too. Jeremy Irons, Gong-Li, and Maggie Cheung. This was a film I looked forward to, understood very well, but was ultimately disappointed.The symbolism is great. The dying Jeromy Irons represents British rule. The scarred but always optimistic Maggie Cheung is the people of Hong Kong. Again, this was a clever idea and props to that, but the film often just wanders and drags.Also disappointing was Gong-li. Gong-li is one of the most gifted actresses in China. She is fantastic. However, her poor English really hurts her performance. She has given many powerful performances in her native language and it was painful to watch her struggle in a English film. Gong-li is great and should not rush to make anymore American films.So again the films concept is great but the finished product is a noble failure."
2,A real shame to put Gong Li in this predicament,"'Chinese Box' attracted me through a fairly interesting looking trailer. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the movie itself. Jeremy Irons, Ruben Blades, Gong Li - these three characters are somehow close, but they interact as if they're from three separate universes. They're certainly not helped by the script (what the heck is this about anyway?), Wayne Wang's sloppy direction or his choppy, disjointed storyline.Gong Li is worthy of particular note. Perhaps China's greatest working actress, I've gotta think that Wang was so infatuated with the idea of having her in his film that he manufactured a way around her (at the time) very limited English. Her very few lines have the feel of being pieced together via phonetics. As a result, the supposed intense relationship between she and Irons' character is real stretch to envision. It's a real shame that many viewers will get their intro to Gong Li in this fashion. She deserves far better."
3,Thread shed,"The size is good, but these strips shed too much of small bits of thread/ fiber that sticks to your fingers and skin and is very irritating. I would recommend cutting an old pair of jeans into 3"" x 8"" strips. Thick cloth is better as it can take many pulls before getting saturated with wax."
4,Good Product,The waxing kit I bought comes with limited stripes. This product solves the problem. Very easy to use.
5,Great price for this bran-new in the package product...,"This arrived to my house in a very timely manner and was bran-new in the package. I ordered 2 of these to take on a week long trip to Jamaica for my honeymoon. They worked out absolutely great. The only complaint that I have is that my camera (Olympus Stylus 400) is extremely slow with it. The write speed of the memory itself is very fast, that's not the issue... it's my cameras taking about 20sec every time you slide the door open (turn it on) and it calculating how many pictures are remaining... I missed a few good picture opportunities if I wasn't ""ready"" for them. Other than that, once the camera goes through its initial power on cycle, the card was very fast and the camera as well."
3,Olympus 1GB xD memory card,"This memory cardworks very well in my camera, but it won't work in my printer. This was very disappointing. When I put it in the memory card slot, the printer showed an error message. I was able to print my photos through my computer, but sometimes it's just easier to use the printer."
4,Olympus 202032 H-1 GB xD Picture Card,"I use this card for my 5.1mg digital camera. The speed is too slow, and it is not what I expect."
5,Type H xD picture card,"I use it with my Olympus camera, which is 8mp. I can take 500-1000 pictures with the memory card depending on the settings on my camera. It, also, records for about 20 minutes. I have truly enjoyed it."
2,Garbled pictures,"I bought this card for my olympus 770UZ from Amazon, and ever since I started using it it is giving me garbled images. I am confident that it is a problem of my card because my other XD card (Fujifilm) is working just fine. Even when I am using the card for standard data transfer purposes, it is showing very unreliable results, with most of the files getting corrupt after they have been stored in that XD card.I believe that the card I bought had bertain bad memory sectors to start with, and I shall be careful nest time."
1,Need to return - *****This is not for posting*******,Just returned from a three week vacation in France - which was the reason I ordered this card. It doesn't work - which left me and my family very diasppointed in France. No pix! In any event - we have tried to format it on 2 Olympus C50 cameras - both say card error - can't format. I would like to exchnage it for a good one. How to I proceed - this sale doesn't show up on my Amazon account.This is not for posting
3,Amazon's Bait and Switch,"After shopping numerous media's and outlets and deciding on Amazon for their reputation and price, I went through all the work to set up my account, add my credit info, etc. On the final page, the price was different than quoted. Actually, the price was the same, but shipping was now being charged even though it was quoted as free shipping. I'm gone."
5,Camera Memory Card,"Great service, and fast shipment. I will definately come back to Amazon when I need another memory card. The price was much less than I could find it locally, and the size was much bigger. Thanks!"
2,How would I know?,"I can't really review this item, because, although I paid for the more expensive type-H card, I received a type-M card. Needed it for a trip, so didn't have time to send it back to exchange. Amazon offered me only a coupon TOWARD A FUTURE PURCHASE for PART of the difference in cost between what I ordered and what I got. BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!"
3,Bigger not always better,"With this chip, my Stylus 400 takes about 16 seconds to turn on - either to take pictures or to view the chip. Even with the so-called high speed read/write. I take a lot of pictures on the go, and prefer the shorter setup time of the smaller chips."
1,Problem with vendor,"I ordered three of these cards. They were to be supplied by DBROTH, an Amazon vendor. They were charging me nearly $10 shipping for EACH item. That's $30 to ship three tiny xD cards. WOW!"
4,Excellent product,"The Olympus 202032 H1 GB XD has worked me perfectly, the results are the prospective ones, the hard camera less in keeping pictures, I am very according, ok"
3,Where is my fun software that was mentioned in technical details?,"I got the card and it works ok.But besides, i was expected to get a fun software (some CD disk) to work with pictures...and didn't find it..unfortunately. So why it is still mention at the web-site, that this card is sold together with software???thanks,olga"
5,great product - great price,it came when i needed it and works great. the panarama ability is very good too if you have an olympus camera.
5,If you want the best,If you want the best color crisp and sharp pictures then this is the one works great with my Olympus camera and its been working great for years.
1,Didn't Work,This product was not compatible with my camera and I was unable to return the item to Amazon because I did not return the item within the time alotted by Amazon. Also the manufacturer was no help. I feel the product could have been described better. I will stick to big box stores when buying electronics next time.
3,Not really worth it,"This lets you get the special features of your Olympus camera, but really isn't that much faster, since my camera can take multiple shots and then write to the card. When I bought this it was overpriced, but they seem to have come down a lot."
1,Bad Xd card,"Don't buy this version of Xd card. I have had to send two of them back to Olympus. They did replace the card without difficulty but they sent the same crummy H type card. If you use this card in a card reader there is a high chance that it will corrupt the card and crash your computer. When I complained to Olympus they told me ""oh you should not use a type H card in a card reader."" If you need an Xd card get a type M card."
1,Disappointing,"Olympus 202032 H-1 GB xD Picture Card (Retail Package)The card was dead out of the package. The Olympus camera I bought it for was also a disappointment, I returned both of them for credit.My next camera will probablt be a Canon with SD memory, which is much more common."
5,Another Solid Asus Motherboard,"A solid choice for a small (micro-ATX) desktop or even for use as a home theatre PC. Don't let ""onboard"" video scare you too badly, it has come a long way in a short time: just a couple years ago it was a thinly-veiled expression for a budget computer with less than stellar performance - now this motherboard is one of several ""onboard"" units that really doesn't need to add a higher-end PCI-X graphics card to be a video-friendly computer. The onboard SATA-RAID is a nice extra touch that will make two, three or even four SATA hard drives accelerate well past your expectations - also an excellent foundation for a budget-conscious HTPC. If you can pick one of these up on Craigslist or eBay for cheap, you will be very happy you did."
2,God no,"No doubt the dude has good charsma and a voice thatgives him something to work with. However, the songsjust don't cut the mustard. Billy's Beer Googles isjust bad... As is Hillbilly rap.What can you say? This is just bad stuff. It's reallyis plenty commerical enough so it will sale, but thatdoesn't make it a good album.Can get get something that isn't overproduced and safe?"
5,best one yet,"I have enjoyed each and every one of Neal's cd but this one is truly amazing! Every song brings something new and different. He does the fun loving songs like ""Billy"" and ""Tailgate"" all the way to the slow love songs like ""All Over Again"" and ""You Let Me be the Hero"" like each one was his favorite. I can't wait to get the opportunity to go see him sing them in person very soon!Everyone should buy this CD! It is fantastic!!!"
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'M REALLY TROUBLESOME WITH THE SELLER, THE WATCH IS REALLY BEAUTIFULL BUT IT CAMES WITH THE WATCH CHAIN BAD, I DON'T KNOW HOW COULD SEND IT TO ME IN THIS MANNER,AND THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT I WAS IN EEUU WHEN I PURCHASED BUT THE SHIPPING ARRIVED AFTER I TRAVEL TO MY COUNTRY,VENEZUELA, AND I COULDN'T CHECK UP THE WATCH ONLY AFTER ARRIVED TO MY COUNTRY...I'M SORRY FOR MY WIFE..."
1,"Disappointing...not ""real"" piano music...too many tempo changes","I think Kathy Parson is getting paid for her reviews because it just doesn't ring true when you listen to this album. Maybe Im too picky or maybe I just know real piano when I hear it. I bought this CD to relax and unwind to as it was advertised. After the first couple minutes, I knew that was going to be difficult. Each song starts relaxing for maybe 30 seconds, then the tempo shifts and just takes off. Too fast to fall into a relaxing state. Plus, most of the ""piano"" was actually synthesizer sounds and very casio keyboardish. Why did I even try to stray from my George Winston collection?"
3,Simple book.,"This book was a mistake of mine! I have been plagued by frequent nightmares for years and thought I had found something insightful. It is a thin book, more for young aged persons, Perhaps around the age of 10-12 are most suited for this particular piece."
3,Quirky. Cheerfully Dark. Very Unseelie,"Quirky fun, but many parts got old fairly quickly.If you like 'Fey' or 'Unseelie' things - then you'll probably love this album. There are a few tracks on here that are timeless that I could listen to on a loop forever.If you are looking for something a bit different, with a sing-song-cheer while being very dark, then this is for you.I'd also recomend (perhaps more highly)To the Dark Tower. The first few tracks are particularly strong.Enjoy!"
3,STANKY DANKY,"DA south a true player disc, will hit you with ""hard-a$$"" rhymesso tough they'll knock the gold right off your teeth. tracks like ""get off my di*k"" are great for rollin' but a little rife with overused cliches about the rap game. all in all da king got the flow and he definitely has the hottest hairiest crystal covered delicious green and black DANK PHATTY NOOGLES!!!!!"
5,Da King is King,This is the hottest dirty south vibe that I have heard in a long time......Da King has flow ....Listen to Track 2 for rollin...Track 4 for the love song....Track 9 for vibin' ....This CD has it all.....
5,Top notch!,Excellent table cloth. Water repellent. Does not fade after several washings. Looks very nice on our kitchen table. I much prefer to use the tablecloth than have to wipe off the table. We take it outside and shake it off after meals and wash it 2-3x/week. I've had it for a few months and it still looks brand new.
4,Great Everyday Tablecloth,I purchased two of these and am very pleased with the quality. Color is true to what is shown on screen.
2,"Seller great......product, not useful to me.","The seller and business transaction were fantastic. However, this book is totally useless to me when studying for the MTTC because it doesn't follow my study methods. If you like to read LONG sections to get at the info you need to study, this might be for you.I work better with flash card style study materials that I can take with me on the run."
4,kik as*,"this is a great cd, if u lvoe death metal buy this cd, also check out exhumed if havent heard of them, their the best, benumb comes close"
3,Nice views,"Some nice scenery, but not enough. This was like a TV show without the commercials. Glad I didn't pay full price considering the length of the video. It's good, just not as long as I had hoped it would be."
1,So General it's Unusable,"Greetings,I have a 2002 Dodge Van. So few of the details listed in the manualactually match the vehicle that I found it almost useless. While Hayesmakes a fine book, they try to blend so many vehicles that the detailsthat you need in order to work on a specific vehicle are not there.In the past I have had many of the ""Chilton's Manuals"" for individualvehicles and been please with them. I thought their decendants, the""haynes Manuals"" would be the same. Unfortunatly they are not.Regards,Rick B."
5,Holy WOW,The first time I saw Terror Firmer it was on one of those late night shows...I was instantly in love. I searched for it in videos stores. Nothing...untill now. I tell everyone who has a twisted sick sense of humor...PURCHASE and enjoy. From Ron Jeremy to Will Kennan....I rate it higher than 5 stars.
4,funny and stupid,best movie ever-will fufill your need for both digusting nudity as well as terrible acting.
5,THERE AREN'T ENOUGH STARS FOR THIS ALBUM,"This is truly revolutionary music. It was recorded in 1964 and it could have been recorded yesterday. Everyone on this album is, or was, a giant star in the jazz world. This is one of the great all-time classics in jazz. As far as I'm concerned anyway."
4,Jazz at it's best! Dolphy was a genius!,"I love this album, it represents for me the progressions that Miles and Coltrane were about to take in the field of ""modern jazz"". Listen to it and be enlightened!"
5,One of best jazz albums ever,Dolphy's only album on Blue Note as a leader is as good as one could ever hope. Dolphy was a three instrument virtuoso and he's backed here by an all-star band. One of the best jazz albums ever made.
5,perfect.,"the best album so far until 2007 nothing tops this one. Andrew Hill is close, very close. But this is still the best album out there."
2,totally unhinged,"ezra pound said that in art there's always a fixed element and that expression comes by deviation from it. there's something to this: no one would sit listening to a metronome for an hour (no deviation), but a drummer who cuts the pulse keeps our interest. likewise no one would sit listening to white noise for an hour (nothing fixed). now i'll be honest: i don't hear much in the way of expression on 'out to lunch' because i don't hear much in the way of structure. if you love dolphy's work with coltrane, the five spot stuff, 'far cry' and 'illinois concert' (like i do), you might really get excited (like i did) by all the talk about ""dolphy's masterpiece"", his ""most advanced"" effort and all that. well be warned: it's straight up free jazz, though ""free"" in this case (like in others) mostly means totally unhinged.of course alot of people consider this disc a high-water mark of free jazz - i have no way of saying it is or isn't, just that i for one listened close and never got much."
1,Noise for Nerds,"This is the dumbest, drollest CD I've ever made the mistake of buying. If you never go outside, constantly carry a slide rule, and pick your nose a lot, perhaps you'll connect. Otherwise, save your money for something Brazilian, African, Cuban, Celtic, or early American. The Penguin Guide gives it four stars and a crown. I give it one star and a dunce cap."
5,last great studio album,"This was the last great studio album Dolphy was to record before his early death months later in Berlin in June of 1964. Some of his best works on bass clarinet and flute are found on here, including ""Hat and Beard"" and ""Gazzelloni"". Dolphy's bass clarinet skills are typically in the middle range and his phrasing and tonality are just amazing. Freddie Hubbard (t), who played on Dolphy's 1960 ""Outward Bound"" album returns on here to add his expertise. Richard Davis (b), who played on the 1961 ""At the Five Spot"" and 1963's ""Music Matador"", is also present on this date. Bobby Hutcherson (vibes) and Anthony Williams (d) were both new to Blue Note, and their presence on this album assured their longevity with the label. Considered by many fans and critics as the highpoint of Dolphy's career, ""Out to Lunch"" is certain to bring more fans flocking to Dolphy's work for years to come."

1,I Really Wanted to Like This,"After reading so many positive reviews about this product, I decided to take the plunge and order. This product just didn't agree with me. I have combination skin, which this product is formulated for as stated in the description, however, it left my skin feeling extra dry. In addition, after using this product for a few weeks, I started to break out. Unfortunately it didn't work for me."
1,lost a stone after two days,Bought this ring for a gift for my wife and one of the Sapphire fell out of the ring two days after having it.
1,Cheap,Didn't like this ring at all when we received it. I looks really fake and cheap. Big stone looks like glass and the metal actually looks like plastic.
4,Beautiful,"I love my ring. I will say though that the ring is much larger than it appears in the picture. That said, it's the wedding ring I always dreamt of."
1,lowrance iway 600c DVD,This dvd was no help at all. I did not learn anything from it. They adveritised it to be very in depth but it was very basic. I got my money back for dvd but not the 10.00 they charged to ship it and the 2.61 I also paid to return it.
1,lowrance iway 600c DVD,"This dvd was of no help at all. It was very basic not what they said it would teach. They did finally credit my credit card with cost of dvd, but I was still out 10.00 for shipping and 2.61 (actual 1st class shipping charge) for cost of return. would not recommend lowrance iway 600c dvd."
5,Now I'm Sleep Deprived!,"While I sometimes pick up a book in order to fall asleep, I found that ""Idaho Code"" kept me awake until I'd turned the last page (at about 4:30 in the morning!). Ms Opyr's character development skill is truly amazing in this first novel. The dialogue is real, witty, and solidly written. Ms Opyr's understanding of rural Idaho characters and local color in small northwest college towns and her ability to write those observations in a moving way had me reflecting on the sanity of my own family. Having heard rumors of a sequal, I'm storing up my zzzzz's so I can pull another dysfunctional-family all-nighter. It's the first novel I've read in a long time that has had me recommending it to friends and family--and the first to ever inspire me to write an Amazon review."
5,Hilarious!,"Idaho Code is quite different among other lesbian fictions. It's full of mystery and humor (oh, I can't count how many times I laughed out loud) and has more characters than many lesbian fictions have. The latter don't lead you away the main theme but rather enrich the story and give more depth in it.If you seek the love story in this book, you have to be patient. This is not the book that jumps into romance immediately.If you're not sure, you can have a test read of one chapter in Joan Opyr's website. I did that and then immediately ordered one."
3,Get Alive Instead,"Much as I like Grant Green's funky jazz cd's, I really didn't like this one. If you want to hear a good live, funky set, get Grant Green ""Alive"" instead. It is much better than this one."
3,"good, but expected more","I'm a latecomer to Garth Ennis. I was so impressed with his 2012 work on Fury, that I've been voraciously reading his other work (both other Fury trades, Preacher (his seminal work) and this).My favorite incarnation of Thor is probably Mark Millar's Ultimate Thor, although I do appreciate the work that Strazcynski did on his run (while I enjoyed the Walt Simonson run in the 1980's, it is hard to slog through now.Another reviewer on this site nailed it: it's entertaining, but not among Ennis' best work. If you like Thor and Ennis, then you'll like this book. The artwork is quite good."
3,buddygixxerninja,"First off, I'm a big Garth Ennis fan. Glen Fabry is also an excellent artist, but...his rendition of Thor isn't quite good. What we have here is some skinny-long hair-hippie that poses as Thor. Did the artist do this on purpose? Did Ennis tell him to draw Thor in this weak-looking stature? I think he did, because it was more humorous than straight drama-action.The story - well, what can you say from Ennis? His stuff is totally out there and he continues it with Thor. I love the fact that we can go all crazy with Thor as a character and total mayhem! You will not see something like this in the regular Marvel Universe! It was a fun read if you want to see a Thor series that's totally out of character!Do I recommend that you buy it? If you're a Thor fan, go for it. Just to see something different. Ennis brought something different to the table and it almost work. Not his greatest stuff, but fun to look and laugh about it."
2,not the best from Garth Ennis,"First, what's good:The artwork is amazing! Glen Fabry does a great job, very detailed stuff.What's bad:The story is like a B-movie script. Something the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with. It's just plain hokey. About the violence/gore, I don't mind it if there's a good story that requires it. We don't have that here. Too many severed heads! And the evil zombie Vikings look like something out of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. Kinda goofy.I bought this book after reading Garth Ennis' ""Preacher"" series (a fantastic set of books that you should buy), so I had my hopes up really high.Check out Ennis' ""Fury"" book, about an aging, cranky Nick Fury. I enjoyed that book much more than Ennis' attempt at a Thor book. His newer MAX run on ""Punisher"" has been good too."
5,Great 90's Idependent Rock,"If you like a lot of simple underground alternative, check out Pony. They produce strange but catchy lyrics, thundering bass, and excellent drumming.I'm pretty sure their drummer is in LCD Soundsystem now, James Murphy, who is a very cool, talented guy and you should check that band out, to. Both bands are amazing.I've listened to this album many, many times now and it's worth a listen from you... and the prices are running from what... 80 cents?? Great deal..."
3,Modern Japanese Swords and Swordsmiths: From 1868 to the Pre,"Book lacked new information from their previous book. Not enough swords, too many interviews. What happened to the sword smith before WWII."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"For starters, the box indicates a 26 minute playing time. It arrived in the mail and I was very skeptical of any Hamlet resource that could be less than 1/2 hour long. I pondered returning it in the unopened package but eventually broke down and opened it and watched it. It's 14 minutes long! IT IS USELESS! DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY! Buy a Sparknotes if you really need help."
5,Willow Tree,All the willow tree figures/angels are beautiful; they really touch something deep in your heart. This figurine is no different...really touching. It arrived earlier than anticipated and was wrapped with much care. Wonderful transaction :)
5,Great Anniversary gift,"I got this for my parents for their anniversary, they loved it. It is well constructed. It is also beautiful and on the back, on the rock that they are sitting on, it is engraved with ""I love thee""."
4,25th Anniversary Gift,This was a gift idea for a very special couple and it was a great idea! It shipped promptly in perfect condition in a very nice box for safe keeping (or moving).
5,Willow Tree Together,"Product came shipped just as if it was purchased in a store. All Willow Tree products I've ever purchased have been of exceptional quality and make great gifts for a loved one. Along with the many angels, Willow Tree products make a great collection gift especially for a mother, wife, or girlfriend."
4,Very Happy,I gifted this to my sister for her first anniversary and she liked it a lot. She was looking for something like this from a long time and it was a timely gift. I am very happy.
2,poor,I am very dissatisfied with product and advertisement of productfrom this seller.This product was wrapped in a brown supermarket paper bag. The willow tree box arrived in bent and poor condition. The figure itself had nicks and dents. The styrofoam was all crushed and the product does not seem to appear as new.I own many older willow tree figurines in much better condition. This was supposed to have been a gift but I am too embarassed to give this as a present. I have bought from amazon in the past and have had no problems with other sellers.I am very upset and unhappy with this seller catboatsue and this product that was advertised as new and clearly is not.
2,"Not cute, super heavy","I was looking for a Christmas tree ornament to commemorate my pregnancy. For some reason, and I wasn't paying enough attention, THIS popped up in the ornament section even though it isn't an ornament. It's clunky and heavy...definitely not something I could use anywhere in my house because my child would probably break their nose with it. It isn't even attractive once you get it out of the box. I'm sorely disappointed and will never buy one of these products again."
1,"""Porceline not willow tree"".","I though this was made of a willow tree, but beware it is not. Is is made of very cheap porceline that will break very easily"
2,Not a Christmas ornament !!,"This item appeared under a search for christmas ornaments. Unfortunately, it is not an ornament. It is very heavy, and it has no hooking/hanging mechanism."
4,This is not the discontinued Angel of Kindness,"Bought this as a gift thinking it was the discontinued Angel of Kindness, and the recipient told us it was not. (However, she liked it just as much.)Yes, it is holding a CAT not a dog."
5,Perfect anniversary gift.,My wife loved this! The craft is beautiful and is very sturdy and well made. Came in great shape and carefully boxed. Was also taller than I thought it was going to be. Which was a great suprise for myself.
5,Great gift,This is going to be a wonderful gift for my sister in law and her husband to be. Great price also.
5,Beautiful,"Simply put, this is a serene decoration that symbolizes the bonds between mother and child. It is a great reminder of what all parents should strive to be like which makes it the perfect gift for any mother."
5,Great gift to say Thank You!!!,I bought this as a small thank you for a co-worker. My co-worker loved it! This statue was simple but well made and has a very quaint appearance. I recommend these to anyone looking to give that little extra something.
5,great addition to a Willow Tree collection,"We have two other willow tree items and this fits nicely with the collection (one pregnant and one mother/child) and this just makes the ""family"" of them come together!"
5,Willow Tree Angel of Light,I love the angels by Susan Lordi. One was given to me as a gift. I think they make beautiful gifts for religious education teachers.
5,Gorgeous Peice,"I received this beautifully crafted willow tree peice as a gift. I absolutely love it. I have been slowly collecting Willow Tree Figurines and I believe they are peices that not only represent real life situations, but they are so well made they will stand the test of time."
5,Wedding Gift,"We received this figurine as a gift for our wedding from a dear old friend of mine. It's become one of my favorites of all the gifts we received. I keep it on my desk in our front room, so we see it everyday. :)"
4,Nice gift,Got this for my best friend for Xmas. It is a great figurine and I think that she will love it.
4,Did you know these aren't made from wood?,I had to buy this one to replace another one for my wife. Our cat knocked it down over our mantle above the fire place. It broke in half and I saw that it was hollow inside and made of plastic not wood. I was very surprised. I never questioned that it was made of wood or not. But none the less my wife loves them.
3,Angel of Prayer,"Was Due by Christmas and they called me to say it was back ordered but it would be in in time to make the Christmas delivery. It did not.... It was 2 weeks late, not the sellers fault it was back ordered but they should not have said it would make it on time I could have ordered someplace else. Angel is a great piece and what we wanted."
5,Excellent Anniversary Gift,Good craftsmanship. Very smooth. Loved the sentiment.I did not even have to gift wrap it because the packaging looks so nice. Wife liked it a lot.What more can I say :)
5,Excellent,This is a gift every wife and mother of boys will love for any occasion. It looks exactly like the picture. Not disappointed in the least.
5,Excellent Product,The product was shipped out quickly and arrived in a very timely manner. It was boxed beautifully and was completely wonderful.
5,Great Anniversary Gift,Great gift for my daughter and son in laws 1st anniversary!!This figurine is beautiful!This figurine will be the first Susan Lordi figurine that they recieve and will enable them to start a collection if they wish.
5,Willow Tree Aniversary Figurine,"Willow Tree Figurines are simple, but beautiful. Each sculpture has universal appeal allowing the customer to attach whatever personal meaning each piece might have for them. This particular one is of a ""seasoned couple"" that nicely completes any family grouping one might have."
5,Excellent gift and family milestone,"I got this for my wife after our son was born, She loved it. Perfect gift to mark a milestone in our family. Fits perfectly on most shelves."
5,Beautiful!,The figurine arrived in perfect condition and is exactly what we expected from Willow Tree. We were happy to be able to give it to our granddaughter. She loves it.
4,A Beautiful Sentiment,"My wife is a collector of Willow Tree figures, so this is not our first purchase. As with all her other figures, this one is a quality product.Shipping was quick and the product arrived in new condition."
4,"Lovely piece, but two separate figures","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister, but when I received it, I was surprised to find that these are actually two separate figurines that you must place together in the right position to look as though they are clasping hands. I love Willow Tree and have given many as gifts, so I still rate this highly. However, I think that this should have been noted in the item description. For me, the symbolic meaning of this piece would be much more powerful if it was carved as one. To me, it felt odd to have to push them together, and also to have them apart. Then it looks like two women praying. I thought I should mention this in the review in case this detail makes a difference to you as it did for me. I guess on the upside, if they are separated and each person keeps one, it's sort of like a friendship locket?"
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift,"My husband and I purchased this for our god-daughter. She was quite moved when she opened the box because she loves these figurines. Also, it was one she had not been able to find in a store. We were pleased to be able to give her such a meaningful and lovely gift for Christmas."
1,not happy,"i love this product, but it has been on backorder and finally available last week. when i received it there was a big hole in it. poor packaging."
5,Excellent,"So cute, would make a very lovely present. I bought them for my apartment, they look really nice."
5,Beautiful Willow Tree Figurine,"I have other Willow Tree Figures myself and so I knew the quality of Willow Tree Figures in general. This one was purchased as a birthday gift for a daughter who has two sons. She just loved it and I wish they had one with a mother and multiple daughters as well, so that I could give it to my other daughters who have more than one daughters themselves. It was packed very carefully in both an outside box and another inside box. I was extremely pleased with the item and with shipping as well."
1,"Not funny- a rather pathetic attempt by 2 over the hill chain smoking ""swinging guys""",I remember swinging London and it was very cool. I remember Carnaby St and Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. hardly were representative of those times. These two- chain smoking over the hill types were on the career outs (the rat pack was dead) and this was a poor attempt to be hip. Result? This movie is just plain dumb and embarrassing. Sammy is salt and Lawford is Pepper- oh that's funny! They're not cool- they're just 2 old geezers trying to live it up in swinging London. The dialogue is stupid - the plot even worse. Remember this movie was released during the time of The Beatles- The Stones- The Doors--and here we get to see Peter and Sammy wearing love beads and Nehru jackets--because they were so with it and such hip guys. The over the hill gang rides and falls off. Don't bother. Want to see a rather strange movie and closer picture of the 60's? Watch Wild in the Streets-or The Strawberry Statement.
2,Not worth the price,It is not a bad item if it cost less. The plastic cover is a soft plastic with a cut out for the buttons. It is made with cheap tearable plastic that does not seem to keep its shape. The arm band is too wide for me. It is a bulky item. I don't think it is worth the price.
2,A Really Big Arm Band,I found this works better attached to the back of a speedo than on my arm. It's just too big.
5,great reference book,"Nice written, nice structured. I am not a native speaker, this book helps me tremendously with my daughters' home work. It's fun to read too, now my 7 years old know how to use it by herself. It's like you have meth teahcer in house. very nice."
5,Math On Call Right On!,I have a 6th grader who needed some serious help with math. This book is the best. It gives you a few different examples to teach your child. Very simple and to the point. We have used it a lot so far and will be able to use it for several years. Highly recommend!
5,Math on call: A Mathematics Handbook,Every home should have one. The book helps in every aspect of learning. This book gives children a chance to review and then remember. It is precise and to the point. I highly recomend this book..........
5,A great reference tool,"I am a special education teacher for sixth grade and I have been looking for an easy to read reference book in order to best teach the children with learning difficulties especially in math. Math is a difficult subject for many students to grasp and this book has many creative approaches that teachers, parents, and kids can use to make math easier to learn and make each sudent feel like they can succeed. I highly recommend this book."
3,Several bond attempts required,"I've always hated epoxy. I still hate it. I needed to mount an air-cooled heat-sink to an i/o chip that had lost its clip. After mixing carefully, I applied the epoxy as directed on a web site. (The epoxy does not come with any instructions).The bond failed two times. The third time things looked good but lateral pressure caused the bond to break. The forth time was a charm. However, I was not very comfortable with it.Big minus is no manual. However, Google pointed me to a pdf copy of the manual."
2,Stock Market Pie,It was too technical for what I wanted. I wanted a CLEVER book to catch the kids interest in the market. I thought this was boring.
3,"j-pop, a little on the hard rock side","Red hot chilli peppers influenced j-pop. I recommend this cd to 1) American Japanese language students, 2) J-pop fans, and 3) anime fans."
2,Possibly Rendell's worst,"Very curious as to why anyone familiar with, or a fan of, Ruth Rendell's books would have anything positive to say about this one.There have been one or two other Rendell books I have read which were uneven, but this is outright weak. Wexford is recuperating from a serious illness, and the book gets good mileage out of this, but right from the start Rendell's writing is uncharacteristically flowery and awkward. More seriously, the plotting is feeble: more than halfway through the book, the rug gets pulled out from under Wexford's investigations (which is fine) but Rendell then takes the story in a direction which feels like an afterthought and the ending has little impact."
2,murder being once done,"Just a comment on the Kindle version - it was full of small typos like I'll for ill. You can easily figure out the actual text that should be there, but I've never seen so many mistakes in a book or ebook."
3,Decent album,"This is a good thrash album from the little known band Atrophy. These guys play with an aggressive style and vocals are aggressive too. Although, on some songs the vocals will get old and a little annoying but it isnt anything too bad. The lyrical themes on the album is really interesting and thought provoking. The band had potential but just remained a second class act in my opinion. That doesn't mean they are bad or that they suck. It just means that as time went on they didnt release anything that stood the test of time. Example: Ride the Lightning, Peace Sells, Years of Decay, ect. This is a solid thrash album just nothing spectacular. Its good but not great."
3,Alright thrash metal,"At first, it's like hearing AC/DC because the vocals are kind of annoying but I don't mean the music is like AC/DC. The tempos are fast but not as fast as I thought it might be. The vocals get better from the song Beer Bong onwards to the next songs(I guess because they were scared at first) I think.By the way the Beer Bong song has a cool death melody intro(the tune that you hear when someone is dead on cartoons). I heard Violent by Nature on their next album and the vocals are more improved. the riffs are good enoght for me. the style is similar to Evildead(i.e. it's the kind of riffs that can start off by a guitar fast and then the drums and bass kick in and the whole tempo is fast)."
3,Good concept -- but the joke gets old,"This book was the primary text in a university workshop I just took on ""Philosophy in Children's Literature."" Being a big fan of Benjamin Hoff's ""The Tao of Pooh,"" I approached the book with great hopes. Williams' tongue-in-cheek conceit is that the Bear of Little Brain is, in fact, the greatest philosopher that ever lived. All of western philosophy before Pooh was mere preamble and the twentieth-century existentialists were familiar with an heavily influenced by the ""Great Bear.""I felt that Williams was more interested in being clever than in whatever other goal he had in mind. He presents the philosophical concepts too briefly and dismissively to be of much value. Worse, it seems he spends more space extolling the brilliant Pooh that really discussing how the (sometimes stretched past the breaking point) passages from A. A. Milne's stories relate to philosophies. Like any one-joke movie or TV series, it just got repetitive and annoying after awhile."
3,an attempt to relate Pooh to western philosophy ruined by stretching a point once too often,"Pooh and the Philosophers is an attempt to link everything Pooh to western philosophy and thus provide the reader with a nice introduction to said. The problem is, in stretching the actions and utterances of Winnie-the-Pooh to an extreme, there is little space left to describe the details of western philosophy. So the reader is left scrambling to keep focused on the sparse details of western philosophy provided which are inter spaced by long periods of Winnie-the-Pooh details. I was not able to learn much from this book as a result and I found it very frustrating."
2,"Not a manual, but a discussion of ETFs","This is not a manual for practitioners, or for ordinary people interested in ETFs. It is a discussion of the authors views of ETFs, and why they are generally superior to other investment vehicles.A bit long. And it's too expensive.Two stars."
2,Not readible,"It is clear that the author is an expert in this subject, but the book is not very readible, (ex: many of the sentences exceed 6 lines). It took me a very long time to finally finish reading the thing, my favorite was the last chapter when he compared ETFs against conventional mutual funds.Unless you work for a firm that constructs ETFs for a living, (iShares, Vanguard, WisdomTree, etc.) then recommend that you not purchase this book,Jim"
2,Ick,"Recently my husband and I ordered the Bistro Grill Sampler, of which this was one of the meals. It was the only one we really disliked. Although I cooked to the minimum time, the meat was tough and overcooked. Worst of all was the bourbon sauce, gooey and gelatinous, very hospital- or cat food-esque, with a strong rancid garlic smell. I love garlic, but this was not a good flavor. On the plus side, the meat had no fat or gristle. Just my $.02"
5,Perfect!,Received it quickly and you can't ever go wrong with Carhartt quality. Could not beat the price compared to other places.
3,Good enough to keep you warm,"Doesn't fit as well as I would like and the zipper is sticky but when I wear it with about six other layers that doesn't make much difference. It is a very warm and durable vest. Be careful about washing it as the color faded after the first wash. Overall, it is a good product. But this isn't the most flattering color."
2,Nice Jacket.,This was a really nice jacket. For some reason though we got it in a size too big and the wrong color. It took so long to ship that we just took it to a local store and exchanged it instead of trying to send it back to the company.
3,"Bottom part is very loose, otherwise, it's fine.","The jacket is very nicely done, looks trendy and really protects from elements - had to go outside into blasting wind and snow today - feelt like at home. But it has one large drawback - bottom cushion is just too loose, so cold air peeks from there. Took it to the taylor today, to make bottom cushion more tight and wind-proof."
4,Good jacket but took to long to ship,"I ordered this jacket on a Sunday and of course Monday they took my money for it but it took a whole week to ship, i found that to be quite irritating, but all in all the jacket is great and will last me many years for the cold winter months in Pennsylvania"
5,Built like an anvil!,"Typical Carhartt. TOUGH, well-constructed. Comfortable.Huge choice of sizes. It's particularly useful in the woods, where brush and tree branches can't snag it, yet the sanded finish helps keep it quiet. Insulation is not super thick, so get it large enough for layering. I bought it with aCarhartt Men's Big-Tall 3 Season Sweatshirtin the same size and color for milder days and to line this jacket on the coldest days. l also have a couple of their watch caps, face mask, and scarf. Cool, cold, coldest -- I have it covered with Carhartt. Tried on and purchased on sale at our local Tractor Supply."
3,Comfortable but Do NOT LAST,"I work for an Ambulance Company, and I bought these boots about 7 or 8 months ago. They are very comfortable, and a lot of my co-workers had the same boots as well. However the side zipper is very thin, and Everyone I have talked to has had problem with the life of the boots. The zipper has broken on every persons. My boots made it roughly 7 or 8 months until the zipper started to get messed up and broke. The company only warranty's the boots for 90 days, so 7 or 8 months and you are pretty much screwed. They are comfortable but if you want a long lasting boot don't get these. (another problem they have is the zipper isn't straight, it is a curve, so it isn't as easy as it should be to zip up (especially if you are on an overnight shift...)Don't get me wrong I am not trying to bash this product, I am just trying to forewarn of the hassle they have caused with such a crappy zipper design."
3,Not as bad,"I read this book in my teens and while I don't remember much of the story itself, I remember liking it."
4,Searching for Your Soul,"This little book of short poems packs an emotional wollop. The authors, 10 ladies from different backgrounds, have in common their ability to search their souls to find the words to reach your heart. Sometimes joy, sometimes dispair, but always something to think about.If Sandy's Fackler's ""Green Beads"" doesn't evoke tears, doesn't shred your gut, then I feel for you.If you enjoy poetry you will enjoy this little gem."
1,Not an easy read,"Too many characters, too many times when the reader was unsure who the author was talking about, ........this reader finishes three books per week........finds a difficult one like this about once a year. Not recommended for the average person who just wants to read a good novel for relaxation."
3,Rips too easily,"Works, if you have tape, but tears way too easily! would not recommend this if you are trying to keep bugs in or out of your bed"
4,Good product for the price,Plastic is thinner than expected but overall good product for the prIce and happy overall. Received quickly with no issues
2,Plastic tears easily,"The bag tore very easily, and was full of holes by the time I finished moving my mattress. I wouldn't use this bag for long-term storage either because, as others have said, it isn't a bag that can be easily sealed. It takes lots and lots--and lots--of tape. I won't buy this product again."
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this product. It says it seals out bugs and moisture but it doesn't ""seal"" at all. You have to use tape or whatever you have on hand to seal it yourself. When I was putting the bag on the box-spring, it tore! Good thing I bought two for the box-spring and two for the mattress. All this is is an over-sized trash bag."
3,"Good, not great","I thought this bag would be much thicker (it's like painter's plastic) and that I'd be able to seal it. It's basically a big yellow pocket. Be aware that upon purchase, you still need to come up with a way to seal one end so that nothing can get into it."
4,Fine no frills plastic bag,"This is a perfectly fine no frills mattress-size plastic bag. It doesn't include a sealing method so I used packing tape. If you want a fancier bag with something like a zipper, you'll have to spend more. I am using it for 2 kids full-size mattresses, not too thick."
3,"Good Idea, needs to be stronger","I loved the idea of being able to cover my mattress with the mattress bag while moving into our new home. The downside is that the bag is not strong enough and holes were easily made when moving the mattresses. If you have king size and queen size mattress, you know they are heavy and a bit difficult to move. So if the plastic were stronger/thicker, it might not have been easily punctured with fingers.Other than that, shipping was timely and arrived when stated."
3,Not great but it'll do...,"I was hoping for the type of bag that comes with a new mattress; the really thick kind. These bags are very thin and easily tear. The bags are just big enough to fit the size mattress described on the product so there is not a lot of wiggle room. I would recommend these mattress bags if you are simply interested in storing mattresses and you do not need to move them. If you need to move them, expect the bags to tear and your mattress to get dirty."
4,Not as thick as I'd like,The plastic wasn't as thick as I'd like so when we pushed this against the wall in our basement it tore. We used packing tape to fix it but still wish it was a thicker plastic.
2,Not Made From Real Bananas,"Was not actually made of recycled bananas as one might expect, but rather is bright yellow like a banana. Otherwise did a great job of carrying my mattress but unfortunately I was unable to plant it and grow a banana tree as a result."
2,Very noisy,This mattress cover is very noisy and uncomfortable to sleep on - I would recommend avoiding it and purchasing a waterproof cloth cover.
1,Poor construction,"This mattress bag did not adequately enclose a queen-sized bed. The purpose of a mattress bag is to prevent anything from getting in - unfortunately, the plastic stretched and ripped while I was trying to close up and tape off the ends. Would not buy again."
5,Good Product,"This product turned out to be a very good quality mattress bag for the money, which was very reasonable. Thanks"
3,Large enough for a queen-sized pillow top mattress,"FYI - the packaging states that this bag is large enough for a full mattress with pillowtop but not a queen, but my queen-sized pillowtop fit just fine."
2,Don't bother,"Description says :Seals against moisture, dust, bugs, and spiders.Well how does it do that when the bag doesn't seal at all? Ugh. It's just a big open ended bag. It's flimsy. My trash bags are better quality. Not happy with this product."
2,Not worth it.,"If you're going to sell a bag for $6.50 can you at least make it a few inches, maybe one foot longer so that I don't have an approximate fit on my queen mattress?I was forced to use duct tape to seal the end of this very thin and too short bag.You may be better off cutting a couple of large black trash bags and taping them together."
4,Decent for what it is,"Not too much to say here... it's a big yellow plastic bag that has enough space to store a queen pillow top or the box spring in. You will have to seal the end since it doesn't come with any tape/zipper/or zip-lock seal. It does tend to rip easily if you are not careful with moving it around, but works well enough for storage facilities."
3,Good enough,"I used four of these bags in two consecutive moves over the course of a month. Three of them were good enough to survive almost the entire move, with one or two small tears at the very end. One fared a little less well, and through normal lifting and settling in a moving truck, had a tear in the side before the journey itself was up. Still, everything was intact and clean, which is about as much as you can ask for from a big plastic bag."
3,Only worth one trip,Tore apart too easily to use a second time but it did protect the box spring and mattress from dirt stains.
4,if you have pillowtop,These were just what I expected. Not super thick plastic but thick enough to store and keep bugs out. The box spring fit perfectly and had plenty of length left on end to tape down well. Our mattress however is a pillowtop and the mattress fit inside the bag but was about 4 inches short of having enough length to fold over and seal on the end. Not a big deal....we have ordered another cover and will slide it over the mattress the opposite way and then tape it up that way. Happy with the cover especially for this price....just recommend buying two if you are covering a pillowtop mattress!
5,Cheap yet durable,"I ordered two of these to cover a mattress that I'm storing in some crawl space. Based on the reviews, I expected the bags to be quite flimsy, so I ordered two just in case one tore. These bags (at least in my opinion) are not flimsy. They are quite durable. One review said they tear and are the thickness of garbage bags. Not true. I found these to be more like the strength of the thick, heavy duty garbage bags used for lawn and branch waste. As I see it, this is a product that unfortunately is underappreciated and underrated -- they get the job done quite well."
2,Don't waste your money,"Bag's corners ripped when ""expanded"" to fit a queen, rendering the bag useless. Glad I didn't pay ""retail"" for it."
1,Horrible,This did not fit my queen box spring and it ripped as soon as we put it on. We had to rig it so it would fit the whole mattress. Definitely not a product worth purchasing.
3,Better books out there,"This book has a few good recipes, but Clean House, Clean Planet is much better, and you don't have so many recipes for non-essentials such as hand wipes for the car. Also see Better Basics for the Home.Also, this book seems to use more stuff (like actual herbs--I'm trying to clean, not clog my drain thank you) and even more essential oils than CHCP. It is a rather small book, also, and somewhat overpriced.Finally, why do publishers put out recipe books of any kind that are not designed to lie flat when you use them? One of the mysteries of the universe, I guess."
3,Good Little Book of Recipes,This book is good but not great. I bought it because I was looking for Better Basics for the Home for my daughter to take back to her apartment at school. My local bookstore didn't have it so I bought this one instead. This book has some nice recipes for cleaning around the house and suggests some good essential oil combinations. I bought one for myself and for my daughter but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as Better Basics for the Home. In fact that is why I am on Amazon today - to order the one I wanted in the first place!
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is so over the top! The cleaning recipes are ok but don't need all the essential oils added. If you plan to use oils in everything, this is the book for you. Otherwise, there are better, more informative, more well rounded books for you to read and love."
1,Insufficient information,I would have bought this item if it had listed information on the physical size of each item.
2,"Has some good info, but unorganized","The book is somewhat helpful, but if you don't remember exactly where something is, the index will pretty much be useless. The book is also kind of hard to read/follow... I definitely wouldn't recommend this book unless you absolutely have to buy it for a class."
4,Exelent book,"This is the best book I have read regarding the MMPI-2. It gives in depth coverage of almost all known scales available for the MMPI-2, and has all you need to learn to use the test. Codetypes are well explained, and presented in a systematic fashion. There are lots of infomration about codetypes which are useful in the case of juding the deegre to which the patient fits the particular codetype description. The book also includes several validityscales which are very usable to attain an in depth understanding of the response pattern of the test subject.The only disadvantages with this book is that the subject index is not too good and, some sections are hard to read. The last disadvantage I can tell, is that there sould have been explanations of three point codetypes, which I can not find in this book. However all these disadvantages are minor compared to that of other books about the MMPI-2!"
5,"difficult reading, but a must have for the MMPI","This book is not one you would ordinarily read cover-to-cover, but it is a must have for anyone who is using the MMPI. Greene is a MMPI genius and he knows the MMPI like no one else. I'm using his book more as a reference, and I'm using other books such as Butcher's to actually learn the MMPI."
5,Into the Mind of a Young Man,"This is a wonderful book that goes further inside of you than the scandals that take place. Mrs. Burns goes into detail of a young mans mind, what he feels, and wants. I would recomend this book to any teenage boy. I promise, it will grow on you."
3,"well-written, but not appealing to everyone","My boyfriend described this book to me as ""a chick book"" in recommending it; i'll have to agree with him. It is certainly sweet and full of interesting flavors of characters and setting. Touching, sentimental, but not cheesy. However, it went too slowly throughout the flashback section. It's not exceptional, but not mediocre either. An enjoyable tale!"
4,I love this book!,Cold Sassy Tree is a great book. I think that this is a book that everyone should read. It has romance for the girls and adventure for the guys. Anyone who is thinking about reading this book should give it a try.
2,Classic,"I have heard it is a great book, however, I could not get past the slang used. Slow start in the book. I wish I could have powered through the slang but had to put it down."
5,A true American classic,"In one word, Cold Sassy Tree is marvelous. I've never read a book that made me laugh so much or cry so easily. Through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Will Tweedy, the small town of Cold Sassy, Georgia--a community in which everyone knows everyone else and in which any type of gossip circulates through the town in a matter of minutes--comes wonderfully to life. Cold Sassy Tree is bright with humor, fiery with scandal and gossip, rich with emotion, and overall written with a beautiful eye for turn-of-the-century southern life. Olive Ann Burns has truly given America a literary masterpiece"
2,A BOOK FOR SOUTHERN READERS ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Have you ever read a novel where you have to re-read just about every sentence to understand it? I definitely think O.A.B was a very gifted and talented author, however this particular book was NOT for me. If you enjoy southern books with a Georgia feel you'll probably enjoy Cold Sassy Tree. O.A.B portrayed the characters very nicely and made you feel as if you lived in the south. I happen to be a more northern girl."
2,It was ify.,It wasn't that great. I was kinda into it at the end but not really. Our teacher forces us to read it at school. Its the dreaded time in English 1st quater. Where you have 1 1/2 wks to finish the book.
3,Very strange,"this book is like ""to kill a mockingbird."" i could hardly understand the book because of the way that they were talking in it. but it would be a good book to read to little kids."
4,Satisfied,Books arrived in excellent condition except for a black magic marker line down the edges of the pages at the top of the book.
1,I found this book to be terrible.,I found the plot of this book drab and just plain boring. The writing was at the most amaturistic. The author didnt do very well in developing the story.
1,"Quick delivery, POOR condition","The book was delivered very quickly but that's where the good news ended. The book was in very poor condition. Apparently the person who assessed the condition only looked at the outside cover, which looked fine. The book had writing on many pages and the spine was exposed. The book had not been taken care of. It's difficult to read when there are underlines and notes all over the page -- how distracting! I was very disappointed and will carefully consider any used book purchases in the future."
4,Great book,Read this for book club and loved it. Most of the ladies that read it enjoyed it too. Can't wait to read the sequel.
4,4 1/2 stars,"This modern classic paints a loving picture of the early twentieth century of GeorgiaWhile the language reflects the times and education, the story shows the love among an extended family. Saying the words aloud in your head helps to “hear"" the speech."
5,"Funny, sad, touching, beautiful, wonderful...","I just finished reading this book about five minutes ago and my eyes are so swollen and puffy! I am a very avid reader, and have read countless books, but this is truly one of the best I've ever had the privilege of knowing and loving. The characters are so real, the dialogue so true to life, the story itself so similar to life's patterns and yet so far from the ordinary. You feel like you know and love everyone in this story from the moment you meet them. They are all wonderful characters; Will Tweedy, Grandpa, Miss Love, and even the hated Aunt Loma are so human in their strengths and in their failings that you can't help but identify with them all. This is a book to give you a new and deep appreciation for your family and loved ones. You'll want to call everyone you know just to tell them that you love them."
1,Chick flick book,"This book was not good. The entire thing was so predictable I thought I had read it before. The whole thing has a kind of generic feel to it; nothing was exciting or surprising. I do not recommend that anyone read this book unless you are a middle aged woman who likes to read about families that don't get along. As it said on the back cover, it hurt to turn the last page. It hurt to turn every page..."
1,Avoid this book like the plague...trash...,"This book...is awful. Terrible. The whole thing seems so contrived and meaningless. Does the world really need yet another book about a hick family in the south getting their first ""artermobile?"" Yes, its quaint, and cute, and features people with quirky names like ""E. Rucker Blakeslee"" and ""Love Simpson,"" and if you like that, go hang out at a Cracker and for the rest of you, get some real literature. May I suggest Plato?"
1,"Lame, slow, boring, tedious...","How can people write good reviews about this book? I had to read all 400+ pages of this for a summer reading project. Since I had to read it, I decided to give it a chance. By the end I had to will myself to read just a few more pages. It really is a miracle I finished the book at all. Plot? Nonexistent. In fact, I can barely remember what the book is about. Southern kind of books with annoying accents just aren't the best reading material. Do yourself a favor and never touch this excuse for a story, and if you already have it, chuck in the garbage where it belongs."
4,"Well, I read it for school and LIKED it!","It's very well written. I stumbled with the language/dialect of the South, even though I can speak fluent Kentucky. Will Tweedy has a personality that you might expect to encounter in any of the local boys, and this is a wonderful insight into a teenager's head; Miss Burns seems to have remembered just what it was like! It's also very descriptive as far as the emotions people feel, the scenes like an old woman trying desperately to see what's happening when an old lover kisses a married woman; the gossip flying around town when a lively old widower remarries with his wife not three weeks in the grave; a fourteen year-old boy's first passionate kiss. This book was never slow, even though I was required to read it; I ended up unable to put it down!"
3,An I HAVE to read type of book.,I was required to read this book for English class but I would have never picked it up on my own. It drags too much in the beginning but towards the middle it begins to pick up from there it gets more interesting. But it's nothing special.
2,From dull to suspense full,"I read the book for my summer reading book for my english class. The first hundred pages or so see to just drag on, after that the book gained some suspense as of what Will would do next. If I hadn't been to assigned to read I wouldn't have. My teacher has told us a little bit about what our test was on and that we need to know the symbolism of the tree (how do teachers know these things). I have no clue though, other than that the town was named after it. This just goes to confuse me of why the author even mentions the tree. I do think the author, Burns, does portray southern life very well."
3,very boring/lifeless in the beginning but picks up the pace,"When i read a book, i need to start right into a major event, something that will catch my attention! In this book, that didn't happen until about page 200! But even when the the conflict and the story line picked up i still could not understand their dialect! I'm not really into all that southern talk, and i really don't enjoy reading it. Don't get me wrong, because i really respect Ms. Burns' writings, but this particular one was just not for me."
3,"Not bad, but I wouldn't waste my time again","Last year's summer vacation saw for me yet another boring required reading. Cold Sassy Tree was the lucky winner chosen by the geniuses in the English department, and for that reason, I lost some respect for it before I even opened it. I struggled with it for the first few pages, and felt compelled to skip many passages. But overall, I think this book was well-written, wholesome, and not at all a downer. This was a surprise because high school English teachers usually like pushing depressing topics on students. Of course, this book was not without sentiment. There was the whole tormented life of Love Simpson matter. However, I must say I was impressed with the outcome of this book."
3,Loved 3/4 of Cold Sassy Tree,"I truly loved 3/4 of this book. It was reminiscent of the the Fannie Flagg books that I have loved so much, beginning to end. It is the story of a small town in 1906 Georgia, told through the eyes of a 14 boy. It never seems that someone can make a book out of the lives of themselves and their family, but yes, someone can! I enjoyed reading the narrator's adolescent shenanigans and loved and hated his wise, but over bearing grandfather.The last three quarters were taken up by depressing subject matter and Grandpas musings over God, death and generally the meaning of life. Once I found out that the author was diagnosed with a serious illness while writing the book, I understood Grandpa's insights and thoughts were probably her own.Overall, though, enjoyable, light reading...until the last 100 pages."
5,A Cold Sassy Read,"borrowed Cold Sassy Tree from my mother-in-law. The title just caught my attention, and has been doing so every time I see or hear it for a couple of years now. So, when I realized she owned it, I decided to break down and read it.I am very glad I did. It was wonderful. Superb. Brilliant.Cold Sassy Tree took me back in time to a place oddly familiar. Cold Sassy could really have been my own back yard in my hometown (Eastern KY). The people all brought real people to mind, and the atmosphere of the novel kept me flipping pages, praying for more. They even tempted me to try apple pie with cheese (though I haven't given into that temptation yet). Mostly, the book made me think of my grandparents. I wish they had kept journals how the narrator in this book did.It was a fabulous read, and I have no complaints whatsoever."
5,"Bravo, for COLD SASSY TREE!","This book tells a wonderful story about a 14-year old boy growing up in the small town of Cold Sassy, Georgia. SInce this book was an assignment I didn't think that it was goign to be that interesting. But as the boy Will Tweedy would say BOY HOWDY! was i wrong. It was so interesting and filled with fascinating adventures. The book comes to life and you can't hel but read more. There is excitment, sadness and fascination that you will experience while reading this book. At times you may cry because the author so magnificently portraied a moment that feels like is actually happening in your own life. Take my advice and pick up a copy. ... So get reading..."
5,Georgia accent!,"If you want to learn a southern accent subliminally, then listen to this story before going to bed each night! During the course of listening to the series I've reccomended it to others, who are already familiar with this story. It is a great story, read with super-soaked character detail and a plot that reads like Shiharizad."
3,Not to bad,"Well this was a definite turn around in books I normally read. I'm usually into those teen age sob stories, but I enjoyed this book more than I thought! It was old fashion and alittle bit hard to read with all that slang, but considering I'm from a small town alot of people talk some what like that, so it was pretty neat. I also like how it brought us the situation with the older man (the grandpa) seeing the woman half his age (then eventually marrying her, and getting pregnant), because now-a-days this is happening alot, and its usually the kids that are not happy with it. So I would totally recommend this book to someone who's looking for a change in their reading!"
5,On my all time Top Ten list,Cold Sassy Tree is a classic story that is so well-written that it appeals to all audiences. The best way to read it is with your loved one. Alternate reading the chapters aloud and see if you can get through it without laughing and crying! (Be sure to include your own Georgia accents::)
3,Better than the others...,"This book is much better than the other required reading books I have ever had to read for English, but it still lacks anything to really get you reading. Despite a rather boring introduction and first half, the book speeds up a bit near the second half and becomes a page turner. Some of the things seemed a bit off, honestly, what 14 year old boy lusts after their Grandpa's wife or their Aunt. I am 15 and male and I can honestly say I can't relate. Some things were unrealistic, he would have been killed if run over by the train, and couldn't he at least marry Lightfoot, there needed to be some sort of a happy ending. Well, the book surprised me, I actually wanted to finish it, but it still has room for improvement."
2,An Average Book,"Yes, this is just an average book. It's not a page turner, but it's written decently enough to hold your attention.But I have an aversion to any book where a child tells his parents the truth, they don't believe him, the father gives him a whippin' (I'm using the book's word ), and the child still thinks they're great folks.Frankly, I have an aversion to any book where a child gets a whippin', whether he lies or not, because I find that HORRIFYING."
4,A Delightful Southern Tale,"This book was recommended to me by another reader crazed person. I had written a review of Terry Kay's book TO DANCE WITH THE WHITE DOG, which I loved. And so I sat down to read Cold Sassy Tree. The author was not known to me so I didn't know what to expect.The tale is set in the south in the early 1900's. A bit of history flashback, charming method of telling the tale, idiosyncratic characters that were full of vinegar and surprises. I won't reveal much more than that, because it will just spoil it. I would certainly read the author again. If you love listening to a master storyteller (those southern people have the knack, must be the water) this read is just like that."
4,Good Southern Novel,"Burns does a great job portraying old-fashioned Georgia in ""Cold, Sassy Tree."" She writes a story about a young boy growing up in a very close-knit, traditional town. A lot a controversey surronds the events that occur in this novel. That is where the boy, Will, learns all life's lessons."
4,Good but not too entertaining,"It was a good book with an obvious plot, but it got slow at parts and I am an action reader."
5,One great book,"I had to read this book for my english class, and before i opened it, I thought to myself, oh great anouther boring book that my teacher is making us read. Well for the first time in my life, I am glad she is making us read this book, simply because i would probably have never picked it up and read it. It is a great book whichs makes you steps out of your shell and realize all the greatness in your life. It makes you laugh,cry,smile,mad,angry, almost any emotion you can think of, and true to the back cover, it does hurt to put it down."
5,A wonderful way of combining humor with deep emotions.,"This is a book that makes your mind think deeply and breaks up the somberness with humor. Anyone who enjoys ""anti-yankee"" humor with realistic tragedies and triumph should join Will Tweedy as he moves through adolescence in this environment."
5,Great book,"This one of my favorite books and I wanted to get a paperback to give to a friend who went on vacation.Fast shipping, book in perfect shape."
4,The good ole days weren't really that great,"To start off with- this is not my preferred genre for novels. With that out of the way - I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has the qualities of a classic and I'm sure will endure as such.This novel deal with many different topics and does so with a bit of humor, truth-isms, emotions and gossip. It has a great pace and the story just draws the reader is as it progresses. There are aspects of love, loss, maturity, class and race differences and the nuances of a small town.I heartily recommend this one if you enjoy a historical fiction of southern life...and even if you don't. I felt this book really does have something for everyone and you will find a character to relate to - I know I did."
5,Cold Sassy Tree,This is a WONDERFUL book and we have passed it from person to person. I am recommending this for our next book club read.
5,Cold Sassy Tree,"Great Book! One of the best I have ever read! This novel will keep you laughing the whole way through. The plot is very moving and funny. Burns combines very well the best qualities of humor, trajedy, and terror to for a wonderful novel full of tradtional Southern People."
5,"Laugh a lot, cry a little and be thoroughly engrossed","I have given this book to friends, who have in turn given it to friends. Olive Ann Burns had me completely absorbed in the town gossip, family feuding and the special relationship between grandson and grandparents. I just loved this book!"
5,I LOVED this book!!!!,"I read Cold Sassy Tree for a book report since my teacher and librarian both highly recommended it. I was a little discouraged by its length, and began to read it two weeks before the book report was due!!!!!! I almost gave up and went to beg my teacher to let me switch books, but finished reading it instead. After reading the first couple hundred pages, I loved this book and couldn't put it down (all my classmates still think I'm crazy for always picking books 3x as long as everyone else's)!!!!! I love this book, and can see why so many other people do, too! Overall, this is an awesome book, and I only wish that the sequel was longer than 15 chapters."
5,A Marvelous Book,"It's difficult to believe that ""Cold Sassy Tree"" is Olive Ann Burns' first novel. It's just too good.The book is an affectionate portrait of rural Georgia in 1906, seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy (based on Burn's own father). The writing is by turns funny, moving, and profound, but always vividly descriptive. Of particular note is Burns' ability to handle Southern dialect in a fluid and controlled manner that is very easy to read. The colorful characters are complex and richly developed.Burns employs an interesting literary device of mentioning an event or person in passing near the end of one chapter and then focusing on that event or person in detail in the next chapter. It has the effect of interrupting a storyteller by saying, ""Wait, who was that, now?"" and the storyteller replying, ""Oh, didn't I mention him before? Well, let me tell you!"" It's a very effective technique for a novel of this kind.""Cold Sassy Tree"" is one of the finest novels I have ever read."
4,Days gone by,"It's a warm remembrance of the early 1900's in the South - not a cliffhanger or page-turner, it's storytelling at its best. Great character development and in many places, very poigniant. Seeing the changes in Grandpa, you believe an old dog can learn tricks!"
4,Wonderful depiction of a small southern town in the early 1900's,"According to the flyleaf, this book was written while the author was recovering from cancer. Olive Ann Burns based the book on stories she heard from her parents and other relatives and she recreated the small Georgia town where she grew up, dubbing it Cold Sassy after the local sassafras trees. Her main character is Will Tweedy, a typical 14-year-old boy who has the usual and sometimes unusual adventures of a boy living in Georgia at the turn of the century. Will overhears a lot of conversations about his grandfather who has the audacity to remarry a mere 3 weeks after his first wife dies. This is a delightful book about a bygone era when many people lived near their relatives in a rural setting and everybody knew everyone else's business."
4,Nice Story,"The author did a good job with this true story about her father and his grandfather, adding just enough fiction to keep it interesting while giving the reader a very colorful picture of our American past in Georgia."
5,Cold Sassy Tree,"Love, love, love this book!!! I first read a borrowed copy and purchased a copy from you just so I could pass it around to my friends. It is such a powerful and wholesome story told through the eyes of a fourteen year old Southern small town mountain boy. I will have to purchase the sequal now just to find out what happens to him and the rest of the family. It makes me sad to think only two novels were written by this author before her death. Cold Sassy town will always be in my memory."
1,Not worth your time!!,"This book, Cold Sassy Tree, by Olive Ann Burns, does not live up to its reviews. The Washington Post said ""Rich with emotion, humor and tenderness...a novel about an old man growing young, a young man growing up and the modern age coming to a small southern town."" To me, this book is not only un-humorous, but, as it was my 9th grade summer reading, I had to force myself to run my eyes over the page and comprehend the plot. Oh let me correct myself: there was no plot. If you wish to read a good book, worth your while, do NOT read this one."
1,80 Pages,This book is to drawn out and discriptive for its own good. It should only be about 80 pages long.
1,My review,"When I first read this book, I thought it might be a good because it was about a kid my age. But once I started reading it, it turned out to be boring and drawn out. First of all, the author wrote a bunch of useless facts ( I thought). This book would have been atleast 100 pages shorter. If the author of this would have based the book around the questions on the test I took on the computer, it would have been interresting and shorter, but i did like the end of it because i never saw it coming."
2,Okay So Far,"I'm using it right now, and so far it seems to be working. There is a CD included, but I did not need to install any software; the keyboard started working as soon as I connected it. I assume I would need the software if I wanted to use the programmable hot keys, but I don't.The space bar is noisy, but the other keys are not. The pressure of the keys is about right for me.The main complaint I have is that it is not really a full sized keyboard. Not as small as a laptop keyboard, but definitely smaller than the regular keyboard I was using before. My hands feel a bit cramped using it.Note that the box does not list a PS2 adapter in the contents, and indeed there is none. The description that calls this USB/PS2 is wrong. It is strictly USB.I got this on sale for $5 to use as a spare. That will be just fine. I wouldn't want to use it full time."
1,NO PS2 ADAPTER,"Caveat emptor. If you need a keyboard with a PS2 connection, this is not for you. Amazon was very good, though. They not only shipped a replacement, but took both the original and the replacement back on Amazon's dime, and refunded the full purchase price. That is why I shop on this site.Now, if someone would only sell a programmable keyboard with a PS2 connection, both ""Tom"" and I will be happy :>)"
5,Must watch for new owners of a canon rebel xti,Thinking of buying a Canon Rebel XTI.Be sure to check out this dvd in comparison to the price of the camera this will be more then worth the price of the disk.
4,Pretty good..,"After repeated listens to this album, I've come to the conclusion that it was worth my hard earned. Good solid rock album, but definitely not anything ground-breakingly new. Standout tracks to me are Suffocate, Down & Collapse. Worth a listen if you're into heavy rock of any kind."
1,Not Good,"This is an example of a band that rips off the whole lots of masked guys playing metal thing...and unlike the other acts such as slipknot, mushroomhead, mudvayne, and gwar, motograter brings nothing new to the table. This cd was hyped up by a few of my friends as an awesome album and on the first listen became a huge disappointment. Not really recommended if you want to listen to original and more interesting music..."
1,This is what's wrong with music today in America,"This is all gimmick metal. Paint a bunch of guys up like overcooked rotisserie chickens and play the same stuff over and over again. What's really sick is some of you people judge this band on, ""how well the lead singer screams."" If you want real metal, right now you can't find it in the US unless you are Iced Earth, Megadeth, or Symphony X. Yeah, probably fogetting other actual metal bands, but regardless, you should check out the European scene for something actually thrilling instead of something that sounds like a barking rotweiler with a microphone tied around it's neck."
3,i dont know...,"i mean, obviously Motograter is your standard nu-metal band. 2 chords, keyboards, weird instruments and singing-into-screaming bull$hit. but this band caught my ears a little. the intensity doesnt stop...at least. but still they could use a little help in the *originality* area. just like all other nu-metal bands. at least this band has good melody, a strong sound and wicked cool samples. unlike untalented piece-of-$hit bands like Korn, Mudvayne, Trapt and Smile Empty Soul."
4,Not bad.,"Hell, I got it for eight dollars, and it was worth the money. My favorite tracks are No Name and Down, because it actually sounds like they tried on those songs. Most of the other ones don't really have any emotion. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but eight bucks in a used bin at Warehouse Music. . . I can deal."
5,awesome cd in my opinion,"I love this cd a lot, i just wish Motograter came out with at least 1 other full album:(. Really heavy bass, sick drumming, good guitar work, angry vocals and lyrics. This music gets me pumped up and i love it! If you like the singer from Five Finger Death Punch you might like this. This has a slower tempo than Five finger and is more ""crazy"". Its more ""dark"" than some of FFDP, if you want to call it that. I dont think there are guitar solos either. I love Motograter just as much as FFDP if not more. Music is very opinionated so just check out some videos on youtube to listen. The second (2) songs are just weird sound skits that lead into the next song. Overall I love this album!"
4,Makes you move...,"Just a part time Metal head...but ive been digging a lot lately andsome bands are much better than others in this department...Some shoutall the time, others all sound the same....but with Motograter you havea bit of everything...and it sounds better everytime i listen to it."
5,Wow!,"Since I purchased Motograter's debut album, I haven't been able to take it out of my CD player. Well, that's actually not true. I took it out of my car once... to make copies for home and work. Seriously, this is the most under-rated hard rock/metal album of the year. Motograter is Slipknot-meets-Tool, with a unique style all their own. It's GOOD. And when I say GOOD, I mean it's already become one of my all-time favorite albums. If you are thinking about whether to buy Motograter, stop thinking and just go for it!"
5,RIP Manny,"If only they could have kept going,they were way ahead of the curve on many levels,I remember manny showing me the album cover back in the day"
2,Not for African Americans,"I thought this product said ""Dark"" because it is meant for darker, African American, skin tones. In most other lines, including Smashbox, Stila and Boots #7, the ""Dark"" tinted moisturizer suits my skin tone (I could be considered light brown skin). However, this does not at all. Maybe by ""Dark,"" they mean ""Tan"" Caucasian skin. Also, I really didn't find this product to be very moisturizing. It's not quite a moisturizer, and not quite make-up. Not impressed."
4,as the world turns,book was in excellent condition. it took longer than i expected toreceive the book.
3,nice,its nice at the real but i get punked with the material i thought its would be more elegent bs it was a dantiel..anyway its so sexy when you wear it with a high heel
3,"Would serve as ideal ""awareness"" literature.","The book, ""Battered Women"" by Lenore Walker offered a unique insight into the horrifying conditions that battered women had to endure in abusive relationships. Plenty of statistics, facts and figures were provided, but references and citations were almost non-existent. Worse still, there was no bibliography and this reader was left to ""figure out"" where the statistics came from.Readers should not draw generalizations from the book either, since all information in the book regarding battered women were taken from a selected group and was therefore not representative of a random sample from which unbiased, objective generalizations could be made.The book would make ideal ""awareness"" literature, but given its shortcomings, the book should not be used as ""scholarly"" reference."
5,good read,"Super glad I bought this book. Very good information, book was in perfect condition and highly recommend to all, thank you!"
5,Great insight,"This book is the only book I have discovered telling true insight stories to battered women, explains the cycles, some very realistic stories. It is based on interviews with numerous battered women, some of thier stories and will help people who have not been in that predicament have a better understanding of what they go throught and why they stay. Really opened my mind."
4,good for liquids but bad for crumbs,"Liquids really do bead up, which is great. It's a pretty cloth for the price, but it does slip on the table (I ended up putting a strip of rubber-bottomed carpet tape under it to keep it in place; the tape only has adhesive on the side touching the cloth). Also, it's hard to brush crumbs off the cloth. I am using a little sweeper and dust pan because I couldn't brush the crumbs off with just my hand; the fibers of the cloth ""grab"" the crumbs. I'm thinking I may try a hand-vac. In general, I like it and would buy it again."
2,so so,"I bought three table cloths and found they do not fit a normal table, they are short on the sides. I did not care for the fabric, the fabric is not ironable either. You get what you pay for."
4,very lovely,This is a beautiful tablecloth. I put it on and my son pretty much immediately spilt a drink and it wiped right of with not a thread showing wet. I only wish it had been a bit thicker fabric.
4,LADYTEA,"I FEEL THAT THE PRODUCT IS GOOD. I DON'T GET AN COLD OR AN RUNNY NOSE OVER THIS PASS WINTER, THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THE DIARRHEA."
5,"Now Foods L-Lysine 500mg, 250 Tablets","I take one of these a day for canker sores (sores inside the mouth) lysine plays many significant roles in the human body. It is crucial for the proper absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. It also helps in conserving calcium. It facilitates the production of enzymes, hormones and antibodies and assists in the formation of muscle protein. Lysine aids in the synthesis of collagen, an important constituent of bones and connective tissues. Besides this, L-lysine benefits involve stimulating the production of creatinine, which is responsible for converting fatty acids into energy. In the process, the level of cholesterol, especially the harmful LDL cholesterol, reduces in the body. An elevated level of LDL cholesterol is associated with the increased risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to deposition of fats inside the arterial wall)."
3,Had better,This L-Lysine is an okay product but I prefer another brand over Now. I don't feel this brand works as well...
5,love it!,love the fact that I only have to take one of these/day vs. two/day - much more convenient - thanks!
4,"Watch the ""mg"" description...","I thought I was buying the 1000 mg, but ended up with the 500's. Not a big deal since I just double up now, but the two items are under the same listing on Amazon"
3,1000 mg tablets Too big!!!,"Be careful if you have any problem swallowing pills these will be too big for you. I have no problem taking pills without water, these are choking hazard even with a glass of water. They are really too big, they are almost too big when broken in half."
1,"Amazon, you are screwing up!","Is it just me or are you noticing more and more errors being created for your orders on Amazon lately and that the quality of products they sell are getting lower, too?I ordered Now brand L-Lysine as described here but I instead got ones from Origin brand. What the heck? How do they justify this? And on the web, it says the order is fulfilled by HerbPro but on my invoice, it says it was Planettool. All this seems so shady to me. I am very disappointed and I don't even know how to approach this issue."
3,250-count bottles are only 500mg!,"Be careful - the sellers are advertising this one incorrectly. The 250-count bottles are 500mg pills, not 1000mg, and it doesn't show the difference until you check out. It's definitely not as great a deal as they want you to think."
4,Sherri,My mother-in-law recommend this because I had the shingles and it has helped a lot. I will be ordering this product again.
3,Very Tasty Cookies yet difficult to remove from can,"These cookies are very tasty and arrive in a good looking package. However I found the paint style can extremely difficult to get into, even with all the tools generally used to open a paint can. So unfortunately I will not order these yummy cookies again. By flavor alone the cookies would rate five stars from me. However the can opening problems, cause me to give the admittedly eye catching packing can a minus one. So that is why I'm submitting only three stars altogether for these wonderful sweets."
1,Would not consider an Accel product again,After installation they lasted 120 miles before creating misfires and trouble. I reinstalled my stock coil packs and never looked back. I will not run an Accel product again.
1,Bad for Deville,"Hi, I did a 100,000 mile tune-up on my 1997 Cadillac Concours and replaced all my coils with the Accel 140017's. After 3 weeks one of them has failed (~$200 for mechanic to trouble shoot). The Vendor, Summit Racing was nice enough to RMA the coil, while I purchased a quick replacement at a local speed shop. I was good for 1 week, when another one failed. I replaced them all with very reasonable cost coils on E**y (Part # D-555), 4 weeks and doing fine. Doing a limited search, I think the Accel coils require a higher mA current than is being supplied for this application. Thank you."
1,Don't bother,"Didn't last 2 days, car ran fine for that long. After 2 days It began to misfire constantly. Even the cheapest brand at the auto parts did better than this. I finally gave in and bought the 45$ a piece AC Delcos. The car ran as good as when I took it off the lot. I even tested the resistance prior to installing and they were as bad as the chep brand 20 dollar units you can find."
1,Don't Bother,Bought 3 to replace all coils in our Firebird. One was defective out of box a second one failed after one month.Have used Accel products before and I was pleased but this junk isn't worth it.
1,Bootleg,"from purchase date upon testing resistance didn't measure up to my other Accel coils I bought 2years earlier,it measured the same as stock,5.7K on secondary 1.7 on Primary, coil body was slightly larger anyway coil failed a 2 weeks later, they are not the real mc coys, but look the same"
2,Unsure of quality.,"I have purchased four of these coils. Two were to replace a failed unit after 3-9 months of usage. Running in a stock Saturn ( two coils), so I dont understand why they failed. Have my fingers crossed that the remaining (installed) two last a lot longer. If either fails, I will definetly try a different brand. Much to my dismay, ACCEL seems to have dropped the ball on these (at least, this batch)."
3,Jay Fans Only,"This is a great DVD if you're a Jay Cutler fan. I enjoyed it but it did seem to drag quite a bit with a lot unnecessary footage of his cardio, I didn't need to watch him do five minutes on a treadmill! It is interesting seeing him go through his daily routine, including meals, workouts, and personal insights of the sport of bodybuilding and his career. If you want a DVD that is more in depth about training look else where, if you're a Jay Cutler fan then you should appreciate it and it's a must have."
4,Interesting,Good insight to how Jay trains eats and spends his day. Possibly could have been edited a little better some parts did drag. Very informational .
2,Did not match photo.,"Not as advertised. Black vinyl, not red as pictured. Jacket was in very poor condition, record was clearly a much newer pressing and not the one advertised or the one meant for the received jacket."
5,I can't put it away,I keep filing this disc only to pull it out again within hours. It is a beautifully concieved and executed album. The warm intimacy of the voices and stripped down production create a very back porch feeling. The musical equivalent of comfort food. But not at all average!
3,Real Time,"I like Tim O'Brien, and his other CD ""Rock in my shoe"" was very good (4 stars). The first two songs on Real Time are nice and you think it will build and get fast and bluegrass fancy, but it never seems to get going as a pick me up bluegrass CD. Tim is good on More Love, he has good timing and a nice voice for ballards like that. Darrell Scott's voice does not seem as clean as Tim's, he's harder to listen too, maybe because I was in my car. 3 stars means its a good Cd, not great or exceptional, people tend to rate 1 or 5 stars, this can't be, most music is average, thats what average means. If you like Tim O'Brien and good mellow bluegrass you may like this one."
5,Truly outstanding,"I got my copy at the Kate Wolf Festival several years ago and have been a die-hard fan since. The harmonies and picking just blew me away - and this in a 2-day festival filled with the music of outstanding musicians and songwriters.And the songwriting on this album is about as good as it gets -- it's not surprising that you won't find a bad review here for this CD.I go see Darrel Scott (and Tim O'Brien) every chance possible - whether alone, together or with Steve Earle. I wish they'd play Kate Wolf again, but at least they'll be at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival (free, 2-days, in Golden Gate Park) this October (10/7/2006). See you there."
2,Valley of Wild Horses,"I think Zane Grey can tell interesting stories, but it is not necessary to have so much profanity in them. For me it is distracting and not what I want to hear."
5,A wonderful story,I am over 80 now and have read Zane Grey since early childhood when Dad would bring home books from the library after taking the cream to town. Yes we lived on a farm and read by kerosene lamp light. Wonderful memories and the story brought them alll back.
4,Valley of Wild Horses,"Pretty good, noticed sometimes things seem a little modern for a western, but overall I liked it. I would recommend."
4,Valley of wild horses,"It kept my interest up through the book,I liked the description of the surroundings and the actionInvolving the characters.I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read western."
4,Good book,A really good book for anyone who loves horses. Zane Grey is a good author as most know and you won't be disappointed
4,compliment,A good book just to relax with. Story line was good also. The element of surviving the storms gave it an interesting appeal.
4,Valley Of Wild Horses,Very good storyline even though it was written in a very old literay way. It kept me not wanting to put it down
5,Verbal painting exceptional,The pictures painted were exceptional. The story was enjoyable. It makes me want more of the same. The book reading went by so quickly.
4,Valley of Wild Horses,"My first Zane Grey book. Very good reading and entertaining western. A ""feel good"" book that was hard to put down. I can see now why Grey was such a popular author."
2,Valley of Wild Horses,As a young girl I read most of the Zane Grey books in the school library. This one was a real throw back in dialog and action but very interesting.
4,Valley of Wild Horses,"I enjoyed the book very much, and am a great fan of western books. I have read several Zane Grey paperback books and feel that a great job was done translating this book to my Kindle.Valley of Wild Horses"
4,Great reading,"This is a good, entertaining book, i highly recommend it. zane grey and louie lamoure are my favorite western writers."
3,valley of wild horses,It it too early to say too much as I have only just started to read this book but so far so good. Jorn
5,A great western read,"This was an excellent cowboy book! I purchased it for my Kindle and enjoyed it from start to finish. Being a book published many years ago, I was happy with the way they put curse words as ____________. Fill in the blank, which I didn't have to do..... just knew an expletive could be used. If they'd only do that now-a-days, but perhaps then books might be more ____________ than real words. I highly recommend this book. Thank you."
3,Valley of the Wild Horses review,Simple western pleasure reading. Entertaining without the literary clutter. Recommended reading for readers without demands for character or plot or surprise ending.
3,Good Western story with a great ending.,"Although I am well steeped into geezerhood, this is the first Zane Grey book for me. At times somewhat predictable,but still kept me turning the pages.. I will read more of his books.Robert Brown."
3,Length of story,"It was all right, but the story was much too long to hold my interest for very long. If you love Zane Grey, you will probably like this one also."
3,Valley of wild horses by Zane grey,A interesting story the life of a cowboy and their family and friends bonding and surviving in a harsh environment using nature's tools to get a stake and starting a new life as they want it
3,"The Father of the Cowboy Western Exudes Truth, Good and the Idealic Story","Written 100 years ago when men were men and the cowboy/rancher stood tall, it's refreshing to read this idealic vision of the wild west. Good overcomes bad. Boy gets girl."
4,Valley of Wild Horses,Good reading. I enjoyed it very much and think others might also. Brings back my growing up years. Hope you enjoy.
3,"Howdy, Pard","Pretty typical oater. Lad becomes super cowboy and after years herding cattle yearns to return to his family but finds they have decamped. He tracks them down and is forced to confront an old nemesis and his son. A few plot twists that maintain interest (this is, after all, Zane Grey) but you pretty much know how it will all turn out in the end. Maybe that's the attraction of the genre: the beginning and the middle might be different but the end is usually the same."
3,How overrated...,"I was driven to this CD because of the title.I thought it would be a pack of good songs,and blah,blah,blah.But in my opinion,the sound is very 80's nostalgic,and,by the way,a bit unoriginal.Zackrisson is a very weak singer,and it's really noticeable how a black metal singer tried to switch to a more melodical style,and failed miserably.The only rescuable of this album is the guitar work.Norberg and Mannberg do it really good,and they sound as if they could give even more than they did in this album.Getting rid of the awful singer,and working their capacities to the top,this band could be really interesting.But,with things at this point..."
3,Shadow of HELLOWEEN,"This CD sounds exactly like Helloween. Don't misunderstand me, I like Helloween very much but I think two of them are too many so I hold on to the original one."
2,A scoundrel by any name,I always like Michael Douglas--he's interesting and watchable no matter what the material. But I couldn't like him in this movie--he has no redeeming qualities and it is hard to root for him. He self-destructs and keeps himself from getting what desires. I should feel sorry for him but didn't.
1,Puuleeesse,"Good God, I've not seen a crapper like this in a long time. I went for a Michael Douglas fix and had trouble fininishing the movie. His character was devoid of sould and such a creepy creep. For some reason Michael's facial imperfections seemed monstrous and so unpleasant to look at. The movie did keep me wanting to know the end result-I am a sucker for redemption. But this was awful. Forfiona"
1,Another movie with an ending that leaves you guessing.,I liked the movie up until the end. There was no ending. What a waste of my time.
1,character not likable,Michael usually plays flawed but charming rouges ie Jack in Romancing the Stone. This character is a jerk and after watching half the movie he never got any better! Frankly I lost interest and didn't bother to watch to the end. Maybe he gets better but by half way I didn't care anymore.
1,PRETENTIOUS AND TALKY -- DOUGLAS CALLS IT IN,"Old friends Danny DeVito and Michael Douglas probably wanted to make a few bucks and do a movie together. That's cool. But this is not a revealing character study or a gripping drama and it is certainly not a comedy. While watching this, I kept wondering if the writer has actually had any real-life experience or has just siphoned off the existential, self-destructive angst of characters in movies of the 70s. This is not FIVE EASY PIECES no matter how much writer/director Brian Koppelman apparently worships such iconic fare."
2,Comedy???,"The DVD box noted it as a 'comedy'.I fail to see anything humorous about Douglas' character.I would classify him as desperately seeking a life, as in REAL life,instead of a shallow existence of booze and one night stands.I must admit I am a bit disappointed as I recall seeing the trailer sometime agoand thought I might like seeing it. Thank goodness I waited to see it on DVD and did not spend $$$$$ at a theater.As the French say 'C'est la vie'"
4,Which Way Does He Go?,"An interesting film. This story starts with a middle aged man finding out there is something wrong with his heart. Instead of finding out what it is and dealing with it he tanks his life. Cheats and looses his wife. Looses his business and pushes all others in his life as far from him as possible. Ben whores his way through this story until he is forced. Forced to decide between reality and this child's life that he has been living. But, which way does he go?"
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"A great cast, so relatively high expectations. Unfortunately, it isn't even worth renting.The acting was... OK, but certainly not what most of these actors are capable of. For that, I blame the directing. The story line was banal, predictable and rather stupid. For that, I obviously blame the screen play writers.So, poor story line, sub-par directing and OK acting make for a poor movie in my book. Far better choices abound."
3,I don't like questioning..,"It was a great movie and Michael Douglas is a brilliant actor.. but I hate to wonder what happens next?! This movie needs a more specific ending! Movies without endings is just so they can make a sequel and make money, but most movies like that are failures and don't make a future sequel, which makes me sad."
4,Masterful performance,"""Solitary Man"" showcases a masterful performance by Michael Douglas who is supported by an all-star cast including Susan Sarandon, Danny DeVito and Mary Louise Parker. Relying on a superb script and refreshingly free of distracting special effects, the movie presents an intimate portrait of life, love and forgiveness.The irony of Mr. Douglas portraying a man who is struggling with the fact of his own mortality gives the film a pathos that could not have been fully appreciated at the time of its production. Mr. Douglas infuses the hedonistic lead character with a kind of swagger and confidence that only he can; drawing our keen interest, if not our sympathies, as a series of poor personal decisions wreaks havoc around him and those he holds most dear.Ending on a note of suspense, I highly recommend ""Solitary Man"" to everyone who enjoys movies that seek to charm and captivate, not overwhelm, their audiences."
2,It's just okay. Nothing great.,"Michael Douglas is great, as are the other cast members. The story here just isn't that interesting and seems like a rehash of several other films that might have been better."
3,"Thought provoking, but a disappointing end - a true 3.5 stars","Ben (Michael Douglas' character) life is falling apart. Ben sees his doctor and gets a life-changing report from that sends him in a tail spin. Thinking that his life may be in jeopardy healthwise, he makes poor choices. He begins to sleep around and makes other bad choices that lead to his life falling apart at home and professionally. It is a relatively good paced story, but it has a bit of a disappointing end.The good: nicely paced and an excellent cast with proven, first-rate actors.The bad: the ending was very disappointingOverall: It was a poignant, thought provoking look at aging issues and decisions in life and the resulting consequences"
3,"Had Its Moments, But Expected More From Such a Great Cast","On the whole, the film's an interesting experiment and an effort for an aging Michael Douglas to come to grips with his career and reputation as he enters his next phase as a leading man. It's also got a phenomenal cast of Hollywood veterans and solid character actors, as well as a fine soundtrack from Michael Penn.So why isn't this a better movie?I think the script is the primary culprit. It's a dialogue movie, and that's fine, but must it also be almost all exposition? Here's a sample of how conversations unfold in this movie:""Do you want coffee?""""Well, you know ever since I had that heart scare six years ago I haven't touched a drop. Then you had that affair with the nurse and we moved to Cleveland and then the dog died and I lost my business when I got involved in fraud then I went to jail and the whole thing blew up in my face so now I'm facing my own mortality and I don't know how to handle it too good.""""Ok, I'll take that as a no."""
4,"Bleak, Well Portrayed Story","I enjoy Michael Douglas when he plays vulnerable characters, and his character Ben comes across as a washed up, busted Gordon Gekko (his classic character fromWall Street). A former bigwig in the automotive industry, Ben struggles to adjust to his life after losing everything after his fraudulent business practices were discovered.With strong supporting performances by Susan Sarandon, Jenna Fischer, and Mary Louise Parker, it isn't the acting that makes this movie four stars, but it's the fact that I didn't care about Ben. His story wasn't particularly enthralling, nor was it pathetic enough to enthrall me in a morbid way."
2,Solitary Man,"In my opinion this movie is boring. I like Michael Douglas, but this movie is not the kind of movie I have seen Michael Douglas make."
2,"Decent acting, but I hard time making it through the entire movie","I tend to enjoy movies that have Michael Douglas in them and had high hopes for Solitary Man. However, the storyline has been done too many times before. The acting was pretty decent and the leads did a good job of making the parts believable. But, there was very little that made the movie unique.As Ben Kalmen (Michael Douglas), the character goes through some difficult times in a mid-life (or later) crisis. He keeps his humor, but his personal and professional life are a mess. Nothing really kept me interested in the movie and at the point that Kalmen cheats on his girlfriend with her daughter is when I really had to turn the movie off.Douglas played the part well, but I would have loved to see more substance or something to really set the movie apart from typical Hollywood productions."
5,Michael Douglas Measures Up,"Michael Douglas is an embittered man who after loosing it all is at the tail end of a mid life crisis. I went into this film thinking it would be a corny, easy film that all the old greats such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson continue to peddle out. However, I enjoy Michael Douglas, and as his house is down the street from the place my family rents in Bermuda every summer, I figured I'd go out of my traditional bounds and see this film. Not only did he challenge himself in this film in the sense that the role is emotional for what is traditional of him. But also, its frankly a good, easy watch while still retaining elements of a sophisticated plot. Check it out."
3,i thought it was spose to be a drama,"i thought it was spose to be a drama, but i laughed my head off in this movie. Michael Douglas does a good job with this role... he is pretty much a man in denial and refuses to go to the doctor (for 6 yrs) once they tell him there is an abnormality on his EKG. He starts living his life the way he wants to and being with who he wants to. Something happens to him one night that you could say changes his life cause since that one night, he pretty much stops being a player.. i'm not going to give away what happens. you will have to find out if you watch it. this is a drama/comedy. very funny. only giving it 3 stars cuz it wasn't off the charts for me, but it was an entertaining rental."
3,"Good Casting, Good Acting but Weak Plot","Michael Douglas is one of my favorites. Solitary Man is not a happy-go-lucky plot. It is about a cocky businessman at the peak of his career that uses and abuses people to get what he wants. Events cause his luck to run out and we watch his life crumble into little pieces. As if hitting rock bottom isn't enough, he refuses to get further evaluation for a heart problem and self-medicates for more than six years. This was not one of my favorite Douglas films, but the casting and acting was very good and probably saved a rather shallow plot, slow moving film from being a total flop."
3,Great acting but kind of depressing...,"I won't give away too much of the story plot but it's basically about a divorced man with grown children who use to be a very successful and wealthy bussiness man but lost it all due to some very major character flaws.Michael Douglas and the rest of the casts' acting is superb and they really draw you in and make you care about their characters. But man, this movie is depressing. Ben (Michael Douglas) just can't get his stuff together and at times I wished I could just reach into the TV amd slap the crap out of him...but as the movie show, it wouldn't work anyway. I'm sure any michael Douglas fan will loe this movie but if you are the kind of person who prefers, if not a happy ending, then atleast on that doesn't make you feel like you neet to pop a prozac, then maybe you should skip it."
3,The Right Choice,"The Right Choice written by Carly Phillips was just okay. I didn't care for the daughter, a grown women, who is a published author for troubled teens high school councelor to be so troubled herself. She is doubtful and insecure, to a point it becomes extremely annoying. She can't deal with the mistakes her parents have made in the past, therefore hendering any adult relationship she has with any man. This point is hammered 89% of the book until finally she faces her parents so she may move on with her life."
5,Just what I had expected...,"I read some of the other reviews from people who had purchased this bench, and felt that this bench would meet my needs. I have some weights that were just sitting around because I didn't have a bench to make use of the weights. Most of the reasonably priced benches are not very sturdy. And the benches that have attachments, like this one, usually are not very comfortable. I am very happy that I purchased this bench. It does not take up a lot of space, and it works as well as I had hoped it would. As other people had mentioned in their review; the packing it arrived in was not great being that some of the hardware got loose. But nothing was missing and it was not too difficult to assemble."
4,maccy weight bench 765,It is a very good bench my only real complaint is the shipping company they dropped it in the drive way they did not take it to door.the bench does all that it is suppose to do. I am very pleased with the bench
2,Not a good fit,"I'm a 40 DD and this bra doesn't fit well. The band is a bit too tight and folds down. The cups are a bit too large, even on the highest hook. The front hooks that you use to drop the cup area are like standard bra strap hooks which makes them easy to unhook with one hand, but impossible to hook back with one hand. In fact, it's easier, since it's too big, to just pull down the front of the bra than unhook/re-hook. Just didn't work for me!"
4,Great Read,"I loved this book. I really enjoyed reading about this couples experiences on the trail and all the characters they meet along the way. It was exciting, funny, cute. It really held my attention to the very end. I loved the descriptions of the trail and the scenery. The beauty and the misery. Reading about hiking the PCT is the closest I'll get to it now. This book really opened my eyes to what an adventure it is and what great people you get to know during your days and nights on the trail. It made me feel I'm really missing something."
5,You're walking with them!,What a great book. I didn't want it to end.I can't say that I would ever endure what the Ballards did and I don't think my marriage would survive that kind of test. It was great to read the perspective of each of the couple on the trail. Certainly not a 'trail guide' but a great read especially if you ever consider hiking the PCT.
5,A Blistered Kind of Love,"I love this book! I was hooked after page one, fascinated by a couple plucking themselves out of Philadelphia to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, unsure of the adventure and each other. Years ago we backpacked many weekends on several of the trails the Ballards hiked across. But being a hiker isn't necessary to enjoy the reverence and discovery as the couple set about their arduous trip. It's a very interesting,human story, written by two nice people."
4,Really enjoyed this book,"It's unusual to get perspectives from both sexes for a long hike in the same place and I really like the way they alternated back and forth to cover each individual view of the same part of the trail. Also, having a family that backpacks and my wife and I hiking for our honeymoon, I can relate to much of what they go through. Very entertaining."
4,Great old book!,"This is a great old story! Very one-sided account of the love of Mary Williamson Macfadden and her husband, famed healthy millionaire, Bernarr Macfadden. Mary speaks in first person, relating the details of their life together. Some of it is unbelievable, but achingly beautiful as well."
5,"Beautiful, yet functional","This lovely tablecloth and napkins beautifies the dining table and yet is resistent to stains. After a dinner party for ten, I washed it, and it looked new. NO Ironing! I love this tablecloth and plan to buy another size and color."
5,UNBELIVEABLE,"Just got ours in for our new dinning table, the first thing I did when I took it out of the package, I poured water on it... NEVER seen anything like that before, the water just rolled right off, I even did it for my husband, he couldn't believe it :) , now we are both happy, I love tableclothes, and he doesn't, this one has changed his mind. I WILL buy more sizes and colors. Wonderful product, buy it and enjoy it."
3,This is more red than burgundy color,"This is a nice tablecloth. However, I was looking for one in a burgundy color which it appears to be online. However, it has more of a reddish color to it so I am returning it."
5,Better than advertised.,"We had been looking for a formal tablecloth for a long farm table. We bought this just before Christmas and were able to put it right on the table out of the package. We have laundered it a couple of times since then and it comes out of the wash with zero need for ironing. We were amazed at the fact that spills do, in fact, bead up on the cloth. The design is very nice and we received many compliments. Highly recommended product."
5,proper gas cap for non emmision gas tank,This is the proper cap for 78 - earlier ford tanks with the longer retainer tabs on the cap as compared to the short tabs of the 79 models. good anodized coating & heavy rubber seal.
3,I would classify this as a .....,"a good read. Not one that you can't put down, but the questions it address are relevant to every person: your view on the ressurection, and Jesus. The surrounding story is OK, but the beggining stoty thread has been done to death in Movies and other books. I have brought all of the other books in this series,and they are woth a read."
3,A Skewed Vision Of Fatherhood,"While I truly admire Ben Stein, and have no doubt how much he loves his son, his description of his life with Tommy and his Mom seems awfully shallow. Nannies? Houses on both Malibu Beach and up in the canyons? Parents who seem to never see each other, even though they are married? Not a lifestyle (or description of family life) that many Americans of average means could understand, let alone empathize with.Ben Stein writes from an incredibly privleged perspective. I respect his intellect enough to believe he knows this, but after reading ""Tommy & Me,"" I'm not sure."
1,Biggest Cher Fan Gives This The Thumb Down,"What was all the chat about this set having a few remixes and liner notes? This is an abomination. This is just the 3 Geffen CDs - CHER / Hear of Stone - 2nd album cover and LOVE HURTS - second album cover with the three liners shoved into a corner 4-spot. It is UN - B E L I E V A B L E that Geffen/Universal released such a disrespective compilation. I am in shock. ONCE AGAIN one of the greatest vocalists of our time gets the shaft. I will NEVER ever EVER understand who WHO is behind the incredible injustice given to this woman's recordings. This is so amazingly wrong. I thought for once ""they"" could get it right. DAVID GEFFEN: HERE ME & ALL CHER FANS : DO YOUR GIRL RIGHT - YOU HAVE THE POWER, BUDDY."
3,NIce to have if you didn't have..,"Yes it is a good idea to have Chers' 3 geffen cds here in a box. But I agree this is not a new set with any embellishment for Chers' fans..I love her 3 lps from this period,particularly the ""Heart of Stone"" and ""Love Hurts"" lps.However Cher is being marketed rather un-creatively, and there is no reason for the die hard fan to spend money for the very same music they have had access to for years!Music good,marketing not so good."
1,It just goes to show you............,"...that anything ""new"" by THE DIVA whether it's a different cover on the case, a ""re-release"", etc. will sell and they know it. I agree totally with the other reviewers comments."
2,"Amazing songs, but Geffen needs to stop using Cher this way!","First things first. Here's what you get in this box set: Her Cher album, followed by Heart Of Stone and Love Hurts. They all range from almost 16-19 year ago, so I can't help thinking this was just another one of Geffen's tricks or bids to try and gain more money. From someone who already has all 3 of these albums, I can tell you now, they are fantastic songs! Out of all 33 tracks included (10 on Cher, 12 on Heart Of Stone, and 11 on Love Hurts), there are absolutely no fillers what so ever. The David Geffen company, however, are being really greedy and so unfair on Cher lately. This survivor diva - one hell of a one, too, deserves to be treated alot better. If We All Sleep Alone was not in this collection (it's on the Cher album) - my favourite Cher single of all-time - I would've given this 1 star. Because it is, I boost my rating up to 2 stars."
5,Best Prenatal Yoga DVD,"This if by far the BEST prenatal DVD. It really helped me get through a few rough days, the exercises are perfect for expectant mothers in all trimesters. If you want to do something good for you and your baby - put your mind at ease, ease tension & worries, or if you just need a little encouragement to make it through some tough days- get this DVD, It's nurturing for mind, body and soul. It's a DVD that you will do over and over again, it will bring a smile to you face."
2,Really weird - not my style,"I should start by explaining that I like to do yoga for its strengthening and flexibility benefits, I am not so much into the meditative aspect. This DVD is definitely not my style.1. It is too long at 68 minutes, and there isn't a short version if you're pressed for time2. I found Gurmukh to be really annoying and weird (she's really into the spiritual aspect of yoga)3. I thought it was very boring - there's a lot of meditation and not a lot of strengthening. I really hated the ""free dance"" section where she tells you to just dance to the music. It just felt strange to me.4. Gumurkh doesn't do a good job of explaining the moves and transitionsI thought this yoga DVD was really weird, boring and not a very good workout. It is very new-age and meditation focused. Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa seems like she's on another planet.It is hard enough to find an hour during the day to exercise- sitting around and chanting ""OM"" is not how I want to spend that rare free hour."
4,something for every angist teen,"this isa great cd. if you like shonie knife then be prepaired, these songs arent the way you rember them. some of these bandshave been arround since the early 80's punk rock days. they turn these songs into their songs. if youre buying this disc because of the bands well i know for a fact that some of the bands dont want you to hear these songs, but you should. this dics rocks all the way thru.youll come out liking some different bands. i recomend this cd foranyone who likes nirvana, white zombie, bad religion, nofx, and any type of altenartive music."
2,"detailed and true to life, but excrutiatingly dull","i love eating-disorder fiction, but there is nothing redeeming about this novel. we see kathryn in the hospital: she frets about whether to eat or not, whether she can get away with exercising when the nurses aren't looking, and whether she'll get fat. again and again and again. there's no depth to her character or to any of the other characters, no exciting friendships formed, no escapades in the hospital. just meal, lounge time, psychotherapy, meal again. worry about eating again. kathryn seems to have no other concerns aside from her weight. she is the quintessential anorexic -- all the details and thought processes are correct -- but there's nothing different or interesting or insightful about her or about anorexia. furthermore, this book is a mess (as others have said) with proofreading errors. i am extremely disappointed in this novel."
2,"It's a good book, but...","I first picked up this book not knowing what it was about. As I was reading it, and I figured out the plotline, my immediate response was to say 'this is so cliche!' because I've read maybe seven books, chosen at random, about ana/mia in the past few months. However, this is one of the truest versions. The main character is very real and could be any one of the girls at my school.Even though I was hooked by the story, the editting disappointed me. There are misspellings throughout the book and a lot of words are dashed that wouldn't normally be, such as 'some-one' or 'yes-terday.' Also, many places where someone is asking a question in the dialogue, there is no question mark. There may be a period instead, or no punctuation at all. There was even a spot where the main character was referred to by the wrong name.If this kind of thing really bugs you, I would not recommend the book. If you are looking for a good, realistic story, however, this would be a great read."
4,"If You Have a Daughter, Please Read This Book","I found Upstream absolutely insightful, thoughtful, and, in spite of some unfortunate editing, completely readable. Sometimes we forget what it is like to be a teenager, and Upstream reminded me of how fragile a young girl's self-esteem can be, and how easily an eating disorder can take hold you. I'm glad I read the work, and I will share the it with my daughter."
2,"Oh editor, Where art thou?","I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I was so aggravated by all the typos and poor grammar that I couldn't get rid of it fast enough. One thing you can count on with this book is every other page or so has an error or two. Seriously, you could use it as a game. Besides that whole issue, it wasn't very interesting or informative. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Books,"Arrived in time for Christmas, together with ""Dracula"" book, in excellent condition as advertised. Didn't realize that these are very small books, but grandson enjoyed them nevertheless."
4,URU Complete Chronicles Review,It is a little tough to give a complete review for I just started the game. So far the guide has been helpful when I got stuck.
1,Uru a bust for me,Unfortunately because of a particular chip on my Intel video card this game will not operate on my computer. Ubisoft says that Intel updated their drivers and the chip will no longer allow the game to play.
2,Better books are available.,"You do not show date of publication, but if this is the same one I bought years ago, it is very sketchy. Davis & Deibel and Teri Hagan have published far better ones for the serious collector."
4,Gives valuable information on all aspects of swimming.,"This book is very valuable if you want to have a good overview of the technical side of swimming. It provides you with a good background on swimmers' nutrition, training physiology and style techniques. Lots of statistics and results of experiments done by other researchers are cited. There are also two chapters dedicated to designing a training plan but unfortunately almost no examples. This book might be more interesting for coaches than for swimmers but it's a good reference book for anyone."
2,boring,The primo blocks are boring - to the adults and the babies. You really can't build much. Simple wooden blocks (non-interlocking) are better for building towers for knocking down.The duplo blocks are much more interesting!
2,Average in every way,"This film comes up short in casting, believability, editing (it's too long) and resolution. It's a story that's been done repeatedly, and follows every possible stereotype. Even Richard T. Jones can't carry this movie.Black man and friends (one ""good,"" one ""bad"") wrongfully accused of murder and sent to a maximum security prison where... every possible prison storyline happens. Without much feeling or anything much to be interested in.It's predictable, poorly paced, and ends with a dull thud of staged and fake feeling redemption. I'd avoid this; there are certainly much better prison movies than this."
2,Lockdown riview amazon,Lockdown is a look into prison life the rape and brutal things that happen inside this move should be shown to todays Youth because is shown what happens to a a young man who has so much potential and is dragged down by the company he keeps you feel sorry for him he was headed to a great future but got caught up with the wrong kind of people Master P has it the worst being raped by white gang members great movie for anyone who has a problem obeying the law
1,Found this movie DISTURBING!!!,"I got this movie about 2 years ago and only watched it once! I couldn't stand to watch it again and don't want this movie in my collection at all.While watching the movie I was totally disturbed by a lot of the scenes. I did realize before purchasing that it's a ""jail"" movie so I expected to see some disturbing scenes but this takes the cake!! I was so disturbed by this movie it just gave me a weird feeling for days after seeing it.I do think that child and teenage boys need to see this movie as something like a ""scared straight"" tactic so they'll know what jail is REALLY LIKE and maybe they'll try to stay out of there!Personally I can't stand this movie but some of you may not have a problem watching it if you don't mind the ""hard core"" rape scenes! I think that's what did it for me!"
3,FIRST AND LAST!!!,"A friend told me about Lock Down years ago, but I never wanted to see it because of the contents that were described in it. Last night I decided to check it out and I have to say this movie is VERY disturbing. It was heartbreaking to watch a man have his manhood snatched away the way D'aundre Bonds did. It's already sad enough that many men are gay or are on the down low, let alone knowing that if he goes to prison and is not up on game the moment he steps into his cell, he can be taken just like that. There weren't any happy moments in this movie,and I couldn't believe the impact that it had on me my mood. I went from cool and calm to anger and depression. watching the way Avery and D'aundra went down all because of their ""boy"" reminded me of why I try to be careful of the company that I keep. This movie is no joke, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched it but apart of me wishes that I hadn't. This movie will NOT be on my list of must haves."
3,Dont drop the SOAP,what did you expect from a prison movie a tea party lol life behind bars you either kill or be killed but u can't be no punk..
5,Great Seller!!!,"I got my order faster than promised and in better condition than expected. Real happy, great seller."
4,Godsend,"Lacuna Coil is NOT like any other band, and I think that it's rather sad that this amazing band is catagorized as a goth metal band, which is probably the reason why they're not well known throughout the US. They are extremely talented. Christina Scabbias vocals are gorgeous and the male vocals give it an extra kick. It's completely unfair to compare this band to anyone else, because they're not LIKE anyone else, they're completely original and unique in sound and performance. I would recommend this CD and all of their others to everyone I know, they don't fit in with any genre I can think of, they're just Lacuna Coil and I think everyone from country singers to rappers (well, maybe not rappers) could appreciate this brilliant and well done album, along with their others."
