3,My Sweet Audrina,"Typical VC Andrews books . Not one of my favorites, but OK. Amazed they didn't have a sequel. All the other books do."
3,I don't get it,"I just don't get why the majority of people rated this book 5 stars.I had high expectations when I started this book because of the reviews I read. I was sorely disappointed.I had a difficult time getting into this book as it seemed there was no action for the majority of it. Just a mediocre read except for a couple chapters towards the end where everything exciting is dumped. But then even the last couple chapters are boring so it ended and left me irritated I had read the entire thing.There are some ""secrets"" and little surprises thrown in other parts of the book but they were predictable and pathetically led up to. Like when you have to sneeze but it goes away - you know it would have felt so good to get that sneeze out and you are mad that you didn't get that satisfaction. That's how I felt after reading this book."
4,Average Book,I am changing my view of this book. At first I didn't like it but now come to find out the truth behind this novel I enjoyed it 100%. It was sad to see so many people die throughout this novel but in the end Audrina realized that she was needed at this house more than she knew it. I always thought that Vera was Audrina the 1st. Hopefully we'll see more novels like this. The plot kept me in suspense throughtout the whole novel.
4,A hauting secret,"I thought the book was good but I couldnt give it a five star cause i did'nt like the ending.The book is about a girl who lives in her dead sisters shadow and is always seeing memories of her sisters death. The main characters are Audrina a girl who constetly trying to live up to her perfect sister, Damien her father always trying to protect her from the truth, Her mother lucetta damiens slave she gave up the life she wanted for Damien, Audrina's Aunt My favorite character Ellsbeth she was mean and stuborn but had a soft spot for one man who constintly batred her I liked her because she was the only one trying to help Audrina, Vera Ellsbeth daughter out of wedlock shes evil and un loving, And Audrina's true love Arden wonderful man that loves his Audrina but his childhood mistake is the key to Audrina's frightful past. And in the end she makes a choice after learning a terrible secret.I think she makes a bad choice."
2,"same ole', same ole' V.C. Andrews","If you've read any of her other books - this is not a whole lot different. Because of the way V.C. writes, I found the story predictable all the way until the very end!! In fact, due to the predictability of her works I have no desire to read any more of her books. She seems to enjoy the same general plot line and simply twists it with each new series. I'm disappointed and have chosen to explore other authors."
3,"Good writing, obvious plot","This story was so obvious it was a boring read. V.C. Andrews (if she really wrote this or if it was her 'ghost') wrote this story to stand on it's own. It is a complete novel, not part of a series. If you are not familiar with V.C. Andrew's or her masterpiece 'Flowers in the Attic', you may enjoy this dark tale between a father and his daughter. If you are familiar with her, this story gives itself away just because you know V.C. wrote it."
4,original v.c. andrews,"Truly haunting and tragic. I really loved this book.The plot was pretty predictable, but still I savored every page. The original v.c. andrews never disappoints."
5,My Sweet Audrina,"In my opinion "" My Sweet Audrina"" was an excellent book about life and what some children may go through. I truly felt sorry for Audrina in the sense that she deserved to know what happened in her past in order to get on with her life. In the story Audrina lives a life full of lies. She doesn't know that what happened to the first Audrina really happened to her. She is constantly hearing her cousin Vera and her aunt talking about all the secrets they have to keep from Audrina. Every night Damian, Audrina's father, makes her sit in a rocking chair in the first Audrina's playroom and try to catch her thoughts and dreams. He basically wanted her to be more like his so called first daughter. I enjoyed this book because of the way it kept me coming back in order to find out what happened next to Audrina. I would recommend this book to any friend or stranger looking for an interesting book to curl up on the couch and read. I promise you will not want to lay it down!"
3,Creepiest next to Flowers in the Attic,"...Man, am I glad I read it. And at the same time I regret it. The book creeped me out. Next to Flowers in the Attic, this one deserves to be nominated for the Sick & Twisted Plots Awards.Although parts of it were predictable, I still found myself gawking at the treatment of poor Audrina throughout her life by her nasty sister Vera and the twists and turns as the story unfolded before me. By the time I finished it, I was angrily asking myself how idiotic can a man be as to brainwash his daughter ... it felt that real.I give this book 3 stars because of how much it freaked me out too much. And normally I go for those kinds of books. But I highly recommend it. :-)"
2,Stupid,"I read the reviews on this website thinking this book would live up to all the other series that I've loved since a child. But now I see why this book has no companions... because it's by no means in league with the rest. There are only 2 basic plot twists and they're predictable from the very beginning and are hardly as twisted or interesting as most in Andrews' books. It seems like the only reason people on this list are attached to it is because it was the first they read, but it pales in comparison to the Dollanganger or even the Casteel series. So if you don't want to be sitting up all night waiting for something intriguing to happen that never does, buy one of Andrews' others instead."
2,"If the main character could do basic arithmetic, this book would have no plot.","This book is hilariously bad! Overwrought and ridiculous, all the suspense is pretty laughable. You just want to push the main character down a flight of stairs after awhile. If you like unintentionally funny books, this one will have you rolling."
2,"Wow, this book was terrible","It's not that it's written terribly, it's just that it was incredibly predictable. And the ending was absolutely horrid! I mean, come on, it is SO sending the wrong message to people who may be trapped in an abusive relationship."
2,Very Disappointing,I just want to say I was very disappointed with this book of V.C. Andrews that I'm afraid to read any more of her's. I didn't like that fact that Audrina's dad had to compare her to the 1stAudrina and also put her in a rocking chair to try and be like Audrina the 1st. I'm also upset to see the way Sylvia turned out. So if I were you I'd not even bother reading this one.
4,A Great Page Turner,"My Sweet Audrina by V.C. Andrews, is a riveting novel about a young girl that lives in the shadow of her deceased sister. She is constantly being compared to her by her parents and is looked down at as a girl who will never live up to her sister. My Sweet Audrina is definitly a page turner, leaving the audience in suspense with every passing chapter."
5,Great Christmas ornament storage,"This is a great ornament storage box! Really big, and very cute! (I have the one with the snowmen, but the others look beautiful, as well.)As a self-proclaimed neat freak, this box is a wonderful way to get very organized with my Christmas ornaments. The box holds a ton of decorations. Worth every penny.Ultimate Ornament Box - 44 Compartments (Multi) (7.5""H x 22""W x 16""L)"
2,Poor Quality,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now. They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."
3,Not very durable,"Be careful when installing the rods in the base. If you press down too hard you will break the rod. It happened to me with two rods. They are in the base, but wobbly and I am sure once my son begins playing with this toy more he will bust them out. On the up side, its a great way to display his baby einstein puppets."
4,Does what is needed,"No one ""plays"" with it, but that isn't the purpose. It holds the puppets for the preschoolers nicely. It also doubles as a ring toss. The sticks don't always stay in their holes, so I've considered gluing them, but then they wouldn't be removable for flat storage when not in use. This one has lasted about a year without breaking. I've had others where the sticks broke of at their connection point. It could happen to this one, but no one has been too rough with it yet."
5,This book is magic!,"Thanks to the mealtime antics of Charlie and Lola, my kids now ask every day if they can eat carrots, tomatoes, potatoes and peas. It's magic!The books' pictures, typesetting and storyline are all fantastic, whether you are a child or adult. This and 'My Uncle is a Hunkle', also by Lauren Child, became instant favourites with the pre-schoolers and the adults the minute they entered our house."
4,Cute Book,"Cute illustrations and clever text. May not change the mind of a dedicated vegetable-hater, but they'll enjoy it."
5,EAT YOUR VEGGIES LOLA!,This is my favorite from the Charlie and Lola collection and our Kindergartener loves it too. Charlie could teach a parenting class based on this book! It's written very well and the characters continue to entertain (and teach) or Son.
5,Pop-up books are awesome,We love pop-up books and Charlie and Lola are fun. We have two of the theme pop-up books and they're a part of our bedtime library.
5,No fussy eaters,"I fell in love with Lauren Child's Clarice Bean books and was delighted when she came out with books for younger children. I don't know if this book is the first of her Charlie and Lola Series, but it was the first I read. I was thrilled, years later, to see Charlie and Lola as a TV series for children (produced in Great Britain). When one of my grandaughters indicated that she didn't like tomatoes, I immediately remembered this book and decided to get it for her. My hope is not that it will make her love tomatoes, but that she will see some humor in her situation."
5,"Our favorite Charlie and Lola, and it's a pop up!",This is Charlie and Lola at their finest - a book that will make your children WANT to eat their vegetables. It is very funny and a fantastically done pop-up. We have our own copy and buy more for gifts.
5,"a great book, even without the pop-ups","Wow, my children love Charlie and Lola, and it doesn't get much better than this pop-up book for them. They love the character & their british accents & I try to (sort-of) mimic them with I read the book. Add to that Lola's quirky personality as she lists off all the foods she will not eat, and then throw in pop-up, 3-d creations of Charlie's imaginative re-creation of mundane table food and they beg for this book alllllll the time."
2,Great Story -- Poor Format,My daughter received this book (paperback; no pop-up) as a gift for her fifth birthday and we love it! I immediately ordered three in the pop-up version for gifts for friends. We received the books and the pop-ups did not work. Their placement in the book also made the story sound choppy. We sent them back! Great book. Just don't purchase the pop-up version.
4,Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato,"The books were not all delivered at one time and it created more work when I had to approve the payment in our system. The books will be used for our ""Nutrition Education"" campaign throughout the state."
5,"Might not help picky eaters, but great fun to read","I don't know if this has helped my vegetable hating children to like their vegetables but it certainly helps their reading. Lauren Child, who writes and illustrates the enormously wonderful Clarice Bean series, also writes this series about Charlie and her little sister LolaThey are appealing characters both in their illustration (large eyed, slightly cross-eyed as well, and warmly done) but they are funny and approachable in their relationship and language.Lots of nice words illustrated and constantly repeated for new readers to relate to - even my 18 month old tries to read along with the pictures helping now.The story is basic, Charlie has been left to try to feed her little sister Lola, but Lola is a very fussy eater, she does not like Carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, sausages,,,,etc etc, and she will not EVER NEVER EAT and tomato. HOwever, Charlie has other plans -Nicely good humoured, bright and appealing for all ages"
2,A waste of time,"This is a dissapointing video. The previous one was very good indeed and focused on the music videos. In this video there is a 40 minute session which might as well be skipped. It seems like somebody just installed a camera during the recording sessions and left it there. Boring is the only word that comes to mind. The videos are Ok but there are so few of them and one is even palyed twice. Another annoying thing is that Flesh-n-Bone's verses ar cut, I mean he could obviously not be there for the video shot but they could have included his lyrics(he's are the best) and played som videoclips of him or something like Puff Daddy did on Mo money mo problems with The Notorious BIG."
3,Funniest dvd ever,If you want to laugh this is the must get dvd this dvd is so funny. Bone is either high or drunk and they be saying a whole bunch of stupi stuff that just makes you laugh. Like when they ask them what they think of the internet Bizzy just makes you laugh this is the funniest dvd of all time if you want a good laugh get it other than that its ok. I want to see the collection volume one on dvd that will be pretty cool.
4,Bone's Second Collection,"Bone's second collection dvd to go along with the album of the same name. The only videos it contains are the 4 from BTNHRessurection, Paper Paper, Can't Give It Up, The Weed Song, And Change The World(regular and extended). They are good videos, but the original collection contained 9 videos. It does contain a lot of backstage and behind-the-scenes footage, which makes up for the lack of videos.The videos are great, the best is the extended version of Change The World. Also contains a live version of Tha Crossroads from FarmClub.Definitely pick this up if you love Bone."
3,Good but there are better,"If you're running this as a catback system it should sound good on most 4 cylinder imports but as a muffler it may not be the best. Unlike some mufflers you do not get a straight through design instead it chambers and you get a droning noise. This muffler also seemed to bulky and the outlet was on the side as i needed one in the center. The black color is nice but i still think there are better brands out there' Magnaflow, Greddy,Skunk2 etc."
5,One of the greatest origami books of all time!,"I think that this is one of John Montroll's best books. It is amazing how he thought of making several pockets and spreading the edges to form stripes on a zebra, or using squash and mountain folds to make spots on a giraffe,still having enough paper to make ears and horns. This is a great book particularly for intermediate origamists.If you buy this book, you won't regret it."
1,zoom zoom items,These look better on line and in the photos .....very cheap looking after we received them...........returned these items....we bought the complete set with everything and returned everything....will not buy from them again......also returned baby bed and baby changer.....cheap looking.......I give this a no star rating.....
2,Not much content,"I took this magazine for a year and found it rather disappointing, there was little real content. I was starting to thing that all the magazines had become just ad space for retailers until I picked up Fly RC, I find that it has much more actual content."
2,Where's the beef?,"There's no meat in this mag! Did I buy a catalog? There are better, more informative magazines in this hobby. It's not a bad rag, just not a good one. It does have alot of color photo's and decent reviews. They're not about things that interest me, though. If you like nothing but ARF's and are not interested in any other aspect of the hobby like building and designing then this magazine is for you.Well, infrequently they have plans and other stuff. Mostly electric though. I'm a diehard ""slimer"" of the 1/2A variety."
1,Model Airplane News,"Model Air Planes News is a joke, read the article on the New SeaGull Glass Air by Mike Gantt. Read the article Under( Unique Features )He whines about having to gluing in a few hinges and how he is an ARF'ER and not a builder. If gluing in hinges makes you a builder I have been in this Hobby to Long. I guess if you build a 40 size kit, you get the title of an Engineer. And if you build a BALSA USA 1/3 Scale Cub Kit you must get the title of a Master Carpenter like Norm Abram on Yakee Workshop. And the editors actually print this crap. I know a guy who use to write for this Mag, and I ask him a question about giving a bad review on a product. It never happens, because they ( the Mag ) will never get to do another review on that manufactures product again. The real deal was RC Report, before the owners started writing about his dog in the articles and from there it went down hill."
2,NEED MORE TEACHING,"AS ALL MAGAZINES THEY BECOME A CATOLOG FOR SELLING.ITS NICE TO SEE ALL THE NEW STUFF OUT THERE.BUT WHEN YOU PUT IN MORE TEACHING ITEMS, THATS WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS LOOKING FOR.AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ROOM FOR YOUR TEACHING ITEMS JUST ADD A FEW MORE PAGES.LIKE RC AIRPLANES, HOW TO BUILD ,PUT IN MOTORS, ON AND ON .THATS WHY I BUY MAGAZINES NOT WHAT YOU CAN SELL ME BUT WHAT YOU CAN TEACH ME.THANK YOUCHUCK"
5,Truly a prize winning book!,"This biography of the English saint and martyr Edmund Campion won the Hawthornden Prize in 1936, and I read it because of that. It is very well-written , tho it lacks a bibliography and footnotes. Campion was executed Dec. 1, 1581, after being sentenced to ""be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight, then your head to be cut off and your body divided into four parts."" It surely makes one grateful for the 8th Amendment against cruel and unusual punishmnet. This is a fast read and eminently worth reading."
4,Good Set,"Many good songs on this album, though very little of the intensity of the early albums, what made Chris Isaak unique. ""Wanderin'"" comes close, and also describes the record a bit. Very good, but not compelling."
5,"Little black flowers grow in the sky (never noticed, did ya)","WOW! Got this one last weekend and I've barely been able to part with it since! Just amazing. Been a fan since Wicked Game hit way back when and I've been able to experience all the albums, this is assuredly one of the best. I think ""Please"" is absolutely an incredible and well-coordinated song (it meets, if not tops, Wicked Game), and ""Black Flowers"" is dark and strange, but altogether really impressive. The title track, ""Speak of the Devil"", is excellent as well! But I can't say there are any tracks I DON'T like- well, okay, I have edited ""Super Magic 2000"" out of my play list. Alright, I'm done rambling, go buy the album NOW! :)As for Chris, he must be as lonely as ever. God forbid that he should get the marriage he wants 'cause if that happens, where will the music head?"
5,One of his very best,"I've been a fan since the beginning (the ""Silvertone"" album), and Chris has never failed to produce a satisfying album.This one is more than satisfying -- it's essential. Chris is at the top of his form. Granted, he has never strayed too far from the signature high-and-lonesome sound that we have come to expect, but man, what a great sound it is!And best of all, this guy can SING. Great vocal range, and no slouch on the guitar either. And I've actually come to like Herschel better than Wilsey on lead guitar.If all you've heard is ""Wicked Game,"" then you're missing out on a great body of work. Chris Isaak is a major talent."
2,Same old....,"I have many of Mr Isaak's albums but this one lacks originality. I think you could begin to say that his songs are starting to sound the same eg. 'Please'. They repackaged it recently by adding 'Baby Did A Bad thing' on the end to create more interest in it, but you'd be better off just buying the masterpiece album 'Forever Blue' to get that song. Chris is a fantastic musician, but to find out why he is so popular in the world, listen to the albums before this, or even just purchase the compilation 'Wicked Game'. It's really all you need."
2,more monotone than a fire alarm,"Feeling a bit let down. Except for the ""Please"", there really isn't anything you walk away singing."
2,Miss the early Isaak and Silvertone,"I miss the early Chris Isaak and Silvertone act with James Calvin Wilsey on guitar. It was a refreshingly classical rock and roll act using the same band format Buddy Holly and the Crickets and the early Beatles utilized: lead, rhythm and bass guitars backed up by a solid drummer in Kenny Dale Johnson playing straight rock. While showcasing his formidable vocal talent as a balladeer, Isaak's recent albums have lacked the pure rock and roll feel of his first albums. The star power and excitement of the band in its early days is gone. Isaak's more recent works - including this one - leave me disappointed."
3,Isaak ROCKS!,"The Isaak fans are out in force on this web site so everything he does is 5 star.Sorry.I am a great Isaak fan. Own all his CDs, singels, been to two concerts & even have had him autograph a poster for me. Simply . . . I love his music. He is a great talent and it is criminal that his music has not generated more hits. But radio sells out to the highest bidder not to talent.As for this CD it is good, but there is no way I can sit down and listen to the entire thing. A number of the songs are on the weaker side. On the other hand ""Please"", ""Speak of the Devil"" & ""Black Flowers"" showcase Isaak at his best.Worth the money."
2,Two Strikes and 12 more to suffer through,"""Please"" and ""Flying"" are the only two songs that are worthy of his fame. I suffered through the rest of the CD wondering if anything else would ever break the glass barrier of mediocrity. This is the shame of talent in that I expect great things from the reflection of past CDs like ""Heart Shaped World."" I think he rushed this CD and we all suffered as loyal fans. I sure hope this isn't a sign of things to come as next time I will listen fully before i purchase."
4,Becomes Addictive to Listen to.,"After Chris took a vacation with Baja Sessions, it's good to have him back playing new music.Like most of his albums, Speak of the Devil has become more and more interesting to listen to the more I listen to it. Thanks, Chris."
3,Drying rack - folding - review,"The rack is not exactly what I was looking for, but I was unable to find the drying rack I wanted. It works well, but is heavy and difficult to move, as well as being somewhat unstable. I have to be careful to balance my load on it."
4,New to the Craft?,"Nicely done for beginners or ""dabblers"". Jot down your notes, thoughts, or whatever and use it later in your reference library. This is better with it's companion book: ""The Craft- A Witch's Book of Shadows""."
4,"Very good, simple spells","This is a very good book but it shouldn't be recommended to novices without having first read Morrison's ""The Craft: A Book of Shadows"" in order for them to know what tools to purchase and how to prepare and handle them.I think it was a tad bit careless of the author or publisher to include a certain spell about mirrors and the life beyond in a book clearly intended for beginners. Some doors shouldn't be opened by novices and some doors shouldn't be opened period. Be very careful about the spell you are about to perform and respect the work included in this book."
1,Not worth it,"This book attempts to fill the small holes in The Craft and causes some new big ones. Theology, that all important thing for the new Wiccan, is pretty much abandoned for spells and little unimportant details...I don't think Wicca should be micromanaged!Also, my copy fell apart within a few days...I think money would be better spent on a good blank book... fill it with your own notes and stuff."
3,Different from her previous book.,This book was not at all what I expected. Every other page is blank for you to write your own spells.Then it also has nothing but spells. I figured this would be like a continuation of her previous witch book but it wasn't. Depending on what you are looking for this may not be for you.
3,Better than the book,"I found that this can be a useful tool for someone who is just getting started. The chants and spells can at least give you ideas as models in creating your own. However, I was disappointed that it really is nothing more than a spellbook (no theology or philosophy), and most of the spells are mostly exercises in positive thinking."
4,very helpful for the new wicca,I am a new solitary practicer and this really got me started. It was easy to follow and had blank pages to add your thoughts. I have her first part so this was a great addition. It is ideal for beginners and those who are solitary.She has alot of healing in the book. It gives you the basic idea of what you want to try to accomplish. Very good buy
2,Disappointed.....,"Bought this DVD on blind faith--I've seen enough of Ellen talk shows,etc. to realize that her dry, witty sense of humor is something that I wanted to see more of. However, I felt that ""The Beginning"" was full of bits that I just wanted to end. Knowing that Ellen is funny, I kept on waiting and waiting to laugh riotously--but only to be disappointed. There are two bits worth mentioning--a)why do we need directions on the back of a shampoo bottle + an 800 number (b)trying on clothes while shopping."
2,Sorry folks... not her best work.,"I've seen and heard so much of her older stuff before watching this. Somehow she failed to make me laugh out loud once. I dont mind that she keeps on making pointless references about her sexual preference, but its simply not funny... I hate to beleive that this is Ellen at her best, so if you're expecting something special from her, this is not it."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a HUGE Ellen fan, but I was pretty disappointed with this performance. Her timing was off, and the material was more autobiographical than comical. As a long-time Ellen fan, I was disappointed."
5,Fun book,"""My Truck is Stuck"" is a fabulous book and fun to read to any child. The words are playful and informative."
5,My 3 year old's favorite book,"This book both engages my son, who got it when he was around 2, and also is fun for the adult reader. Watch for the subplot as the truck's cargo is quietly unloaded by some crafty creatures who take advantage of the many attempts it takes to get the truck rolling again. We read this book over and over and it never wears thin."
3,GreatBooksLover,"Our 2 1/2 son seems to really like it (he likes all cars/trucks), but the rhymes are very choppy plus my tongue gets stuck reading it. I compose my own verses for our son, and cannot believe this book was even published. Its grammatically incorrect verses do not impress me. The illustrations are also a bit crude. If your child likes cars, choose another book like ""Good night, good night construction site."""
5,Grandson's favorite book,"My grandson, who is almost two-and-a-half, always picked ""My Truck is Stuck"" for me to read to him when we skyped each week, so I sent him his own copy and now we read to each other! He has memorized many of the rhymes so we truly ""read"" together. This is the perfect book for toddlers (especially 2-3 year old boys) who love big trucks. The rhymes are rollicking and the pictures are bright and clearly support the text. I highly recommend this book."
4,My 18 month old daughter won't sit through the whole book,My 18 month old daugther loves this book but only if I improvise. She will not sit through the entire book but she is a bit young for it. She loves trucks and the dogs driving the trucks and other vehicles.
5,A current obsession,"This book was purchased as suggested for emphasis of final k sounds for my son with articulation problems. He ADORES this book! It is a large book with paper pages. My son even uses his cozy coupe and wagon connected with a rope or chain in the back yard to reenact the story line. The illustrations are quite beautiful and the rhyme and meter are fun to read, although it is still tiring to read it multiple times per day."
5,Fun book!,My 2 year old son loves to have us read this book to him! He loves watching the gophers (I think that's what they are) steal the bones. This is a very fun book and great for kids who love big trucks!
5,Great Book,"I purchased this book for my 2-year old son and we just received it today. Already, he can't put it down. He's had me read this book to him at least 7 times. I finally had to put an end to it by turning off the lights! It's beautifully illustrated and although the rhymes are not as good as his other books, I just added a few extra words make the cadence sound better. Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended!"
5,My Truck is Stuck,Very cute board book which can be read to boys or girls. It also helps them learn how to count to 5.
3,Good but not Great,His train book is my all time favorite book to read to my son so was hoping for another Awesome one. It is so-so. Doesn't flow as well and not as fun to read.
3,Fun book,"This book is mildly fun and quick to read, although I do get a little tired of reading this one. My 2 year old seems to enjoy the repetitive words, I on the other hand find it gets old in this particular childrens book. The pictures are nice and the story is good, just not one of my favorites. I would buy it used but wouldn't recommend paying full price new."
2,Not nearly as cute as Goodnight Construction Site,"I bought this on impulse as a stocking stuffer and we're under-impressed in our house with it, whereas we think Goodnight, Goodnight Construction Site is wonderful! That's the book we recommend."
5,Read it Again!,This is the first book I brought home (out of MANY) that my 2-year-old son has asked me to read and re-read to him. I am not too fond of the rhythm and rhyme but if he wants me to read with him I'll read the phonebook!
4,fun counting book - board book,"I enjoy reading this to my son but he doesn't ask for it often. (in the same vein, we prefer My duck is stuck). the truck is stuck and all the other vehicles try to help until eventually the truck is unstuck. it's also a counting book. Good for 2 - 4 year olds."
5,Another great book.,"I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old nephew. He loved it so much I bought another copy for my own 4 year old son. Short, easy to read book. My son loves the different vehicles that come to try and help the truck get unstuck. And the board book style makes it durable enough for my son's 1 year old sister to play with it and not ruin the pages."
4,Dorman control arm,This control arm fits perfectly and is easily installed by me and I am not a professional mechanic by any means. Its advertised elsewhere that this unit corrects the ball joint problems (early failure) of the Acura oem unit so I am hopping that will happen. So far its been about five months and it seems to work OK. Also I read in auto web sites that Dorman specializes in identifying problem automobile parts and makes improved replaced parts so that should increases one's confidence in their replacement part.
2,Works but flawed design,I got this control arm from Rock Auto and put it on my 1996 Accord Lx. It did fit however there were two problems with it. 1. The hole for the cotter pin was drilled way to low. When I torqued the castle nut to 29 foot pounds the hole was completely clear of the hole in the stud for the cotter pin. I had to use 2 m10 washers to make it fit. #2 the damn cotter pin that came with it didn't fit. It would go in but just wouldn't go in all the way. So I ended up having to make a trip to autozone to buy some washers and an assortment pack of cotter pins. Pretty lame design if you ask me. I would just buy a more expensive one that actually works better seeing as you'll have to buy extra stuff anyways.
3,Simple Summaries....,If what you want are simple summaries of various views...then this is the book for you.I wanted a basic text and that is what I found here. It was not exciting reading but wasinformitive and basic.
3,2011 Japanese Import CD,"This is a review of the 2011 Japanese Import. What is up with the digital music loudness wars lately? They use a lot of digital compression on mastering this disk. The opening note of the first song pegs the VU meters at 0.0dB and barely gets below it throughout. I like Joe loud but give me some dynamic range. Sound quality seems good otherwise. This disk and its compression would probably be best in an automobile environment. I have the same complaint with a lot of HD Tracks downloads - overly compressed. Take a cue from MFSL Joe Walsh Barnstorm CD if you want an example of dynamic range, Joe Walsh, and superb disk mastering. If I paid $5.00 for this CD I wouldn't bother with a review but at $55.00 for the import I expected much more."
3,So What Joe Walsh,"I've listened to Joe Walshe's music since 1972 and James Gang. Joe's guitar work is good and his talent is here in this music, but his music lacks something that would keep a fan coming back when he puts out new material. Joe's vocals are appreciated by those who like Joe, but he is not much of a vocalist. The Songs on this CD are not written well and if not for the performance of Joe guitar work, would be simple and boring at best. Not his best work."
4,Walsh Rules...for awhile anyways,"Joe Walsh's 'So What' is certainly a flash of brilliance, but just a flash. His later material would fall short in artistry, and then came the Eagles which, for me, sort of put a wrap on his career (Meisner didn't need help). Very rarely have I heard an album which makes me stop what I am doing and just {{{listen}}}. Emma, County Fair, and Help Me Through the Night are all melody jackpots. Turn to Stone is a good example how Walsh was evolving his sound from the James Gang days. This is a very well done album. Also of note is Joe's work on Dan Fogelberg's album 'Souvenirs'. One will certainly compliment the other. Enjoy the experience."
5,Funny and Sobering!,"This book shows how foolish people have been in their quest for cures from disease and perfect health. The sad part is that it's still going on all around us and people are absolutely serious about it. Except now it's called ""alternative medicine"" and the government is spending taxpayers' dollars on it. Hilarious indeed!"
1,Fluke TP2 Slim Reach Test Probes 2 mm,"WRONG TEST PROBES, these will not fit on to the end of my probe tips to extend the reach of my probes..........UNUSEABLE and A WASTE OF MONEY"
3,A disappointment,"I was very much looking forward to the paperback Collins Bird Guide, but unfortunately the pages are crowded, the print tiny and cramped, and the binding does not allow the book to open completely. While the Guide may be exhaustive and accurate, it is neither satisfactory as a field guide nor enjoyable to read at home. Were the text less verbose and even conversational, perhaps a larger font could have been used. I had hoped for something analogous to Sibley, ""Field Guide to Birds of Western North America"", which has a clear layout and a binding that opens properly."
4,Excellent field guide.,"Probably the ultimate identification guide, packed with concise and useful field information.It is very hard to find any flaws to this book, but here it is: the illustrations, while being of good quality, are a little too small. The fact that each species has several, showing different postures or activities, enhances the ID value, although there comes a point where the page begins to look too crowded."
2,Just dissapointing,"Honestly, I love the loaf. I can't say enough good things about Vee Vee, Greatest of all time, and my favorite, all the nations airports. But this album just...(bad). Really. And take my advice. i hate to admit it, and i tried to get into this because i love every last effort, but this one just sounds disorganized, it's the sound of a band trying to pretend they have heart in the music. But there really isn't too much on here. Never in my life has music given me a headache, but track 7 will give me one every time. This is one archers album to live without."
4,Good AOL Release,"While not AOL's best release, this is a worthy effort by one of the best ""true"" indie bands. Chapel Hill shouldn't just be known for its basketball but also for AOL."
1,time to break up,i've loved AOL from the very first 7 inch...i can't count the times i've reach for their cd's and i will continue to do so - but WTH isn't an AOL album...i couldn't wait to listen to it and i was left completely devoid and let down - if you hear this album first - run...run and return it and buy Icky Mettle and work your way up to this one from there...spend a lot of time with All The Nations Airports and listen to them loud...some of my very favorite songs are AOL songs (and that's saying alot when you have thousands of cd's/records)...but i don't see this album being anything but a space filler...
2,Poor quality,"Poor quality---bad material; bad ""workmanship"". The velcros around the wrist are not sewn in right---it scratches my hand and arm.'Though I can fix that pretty easily by re-sewing it (and maybe get rid of the velcros in pockets while I'm at it), the pockets are made of wrong material: I have a rather dry hand, and each time I put my hand in the pocket, I can almost feel cuticles forming. It would've been O.K. if they just used the same material as the rest of the jacket, but the material that pockets are made out of is just horrible and not pleasant to the touch."
1,flawed design,"IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE."
5,Excellent Mantis-instruction DVD,"I must say the ""White Ape Steals Peach"" - DVD is VERY GOOD, with clear and precice instruction, that is easy to follow. I like the fact that they have included applications, different options to view the form, and detailed instructions on how to execute to moves.Mantis is quite a tricky style to learn, and through DVD it is even more difficult, but having a background already in Mantis, I found this instruction DVD to be very easy to learn from.This is excellent work!! Keep it up, and give us many more DVD`s in the future.I hope to see more weapons-DVD`s also (saber, stick, sword or other ""exotic"" weapons) from MartialSkill.I will definitely check out the other videos from MartialSkill as well, looking forward to see the ""Chain Styles DVD"" soon. :)"
3,Ok show but McGoohan's obvious bi-sexuality is hindering,In real PAtrick McGoohan is married to a lady (Joan Drummond). Fine but he is definitely afraid and/or despising of most women. THis carries right over into his Number 6 character in THe Prisoner. nearly anytime he had to do anything even vaguely romantic with girls on the show he plays really hard against it. He also write a dozen or more times when he touches men. Other problems in characters and technology the show has is it's dated feeling and the ending to the whole show is a non-payoff ripoff. I think producer George Markstein once said that of The Prisoner something like the Prisoner was the biggest bunch of nothing ever compiled.
4,"An older edition, now scarce and pricey","This was originally intended for one of the ""Bending the Landscape"" collections of gay-oriented SF/fantasy, so it should come as no surprise that it has LOTS of gay and homoerotic content. But, as usual, Storm's handling of the relationships is among the best I've read, and overall this is a great, if a bit short, story. That's my only serious beef with the book; it's a novella published as a single work and at US$13 or so, it's quite pricey. It has since been reprinted by a domestic press with additional stories to ""flesh it out"" as a collection of short fiction, and that edition is easier to find, cheaper, and a better overall buy."
3,"3,5 stars A nice album","I believe that this is a good album but not so good as many people say. With the exception of Rebellion in dreamland, which is really Amazing track, the other tracks are just ok or good but with no big suprises. I Liked much more their previous albums. This album is a classic power metal album 9Im not into classic so much with the exception Of Helloweens Keepers). On the other way if you like power metal then this is a must album."
5,Franklin,I like this book and enjoy how he accomplish all the things that were in his journal. Like all the many inventions and the virtues that he put for humans.Great journal.
4,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"Benjamin Franklin's advice on how to be healthy, wealthy and wise is just as applicaple to our lives today as it was in the 18th century."
4,Benjamin Franklin,"Very interesting read. Gets a bit tedious at the end, but well worth the read for the first 2/3rd alone. Just wish we had more politicians like him now, who put the country and people before his own bank account. Everyone could learn from his example of self betterment, education and civic service for the sole purpose of making oneself a better human being and useful to others w/o the need for a $ payout."
3,Improved and Overpriced!,"For nursing undergraduates volume one was an adequate introduction to Hermeneutic Phenomenological Research. A beginners guide only. As wider reading is required to acquire an understanding of this complex philosophical approach to doing research, this volume is a distinct improvement. It is, however, as overpriced as the first."
3,So so,I ordered this to review it for my university class. Only one chapter was applicable to the interviewing they do.
3,Good,"Full of energetic creativity soon after leaving Helloween, master Kai Hansen assembled this band and released their debut album HEADING FOR TOMORROW. The rhythm section of Wessel and the bass player lasted only for this album. But it's a good album, much better than Helloween albums pos-Kai Hansen."
4,A little of everything,"I stumbled on this CD in a used CD store about a year ago. I immediately pinpointed Ralf Scheepers as a top notch singer whose every recording I must track down. This guy is amazing and he can sing any style of metal as displayed on the eclectic CD. Songs like ""Heading For Tomorrow"" showcase his operatic abilities, ""Space Eater"" shows off his Halford-like growling abilities, and ""Free Time"" shows off his melodic AOR abilities. This guy could sing for Dream Theater, Def Leppard, or Judas Priest...and be better than those bands singers. This is an odd CD and if not for the thin-sounding low budget production, this would be a 5-star CD."
1,Spiritualism and Rich are Incompatible,"This worthless book on ""how to get rich and quick"" follows the close proximity of info-mercials which permeate the late nite, most, if not all, are insane scams geared towards desperate people without income by shoody investment deals. This book, which attempts to be ""spiritual"", not only is complete nonsense, since it equates being rich with ""wisdom"" but it is filled by the author's egomania. Most of the reviews here were written by the author's press team, which only gave it positive reviews but since I am here to speak the truth, I'll give it a thumbs down. I can't believe that Americans are buying this (bleep) up."
1,Nothing New,"This is not a particuarly interesting entry in the crowded field of spiritual abundance. Blessedly short, it is devoid of any practical exercises or original insights. The author introduces each chapter with the same verse of a psalm on wisdom and shares his dry perceptions in each chapter.If you are interested in a spiritual approach with a strong Biblical flavor, you would be better served by Catherine Ponder books. If you are interested in a non-denominational approach, check out the Abraham series by Esther and Jerry Hicks or versions thereof by Joe Vitale (Attractor Factor) or Lynn Grabhorn (Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting). Each of these provides a stimulating look at abundance and manifestation and is chock-full of practical exercises and suggestions."
3,Intro to Type in College Review,"I really enjoyed this book. I had to read it for a class of mine, but it was definately not a chore. I found it to be very interesting, and I am looking forward to reading more books on psychology"
2,Great for the photos at least,"The pictures in this book are wonderful and quite inspiring. I would LOVE to knit a nice toy farm set for visiting friend's kids. However, this book won't help you knit a set as wonderful as the one pictured. Many of the patterns are missing vital details, like the pattern for the ears or tail. Additionally, the patterns have been dumbed down from the versions in the pictures. Many of the photographed animals are knit using short rows, yet the patterns are for simplistic animals with log shapes for the body and legs just stitched together to look vaguely like an animal. Kids can make animals just like that by stitching together their icord from their knitting spools!Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the patterns in this book but still in love with the photos. I intend on giving away the failed animals I made following the patterns in this book and then design my own critters to more closely match those in the photographs."
4,buy 'knitted gardens' too and use in conjunction!,"This is a small (32 page) book with instructions for really cute animals, knitted pipe cleaner people and buildings. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the details for the base are sketchy and I would recommend you to get Jan Messent's 'Knitted Gardens' which DOES give more info on a base together with other features you could incorporate into your farm (hedges, beehives etc). Incidentally Messent edited and illustrated 'knitted farmyard' so the 2 books have a lot in common"
5,Unbelievable.,"This stuff is worth its weight in gold -- it's to good to be true! It's got plenty of rich, layered maple flavor and a touch of butter. And no calories! My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a gallon container. :-)"
1,"Beware...this is not Pancake Syrup, despite the label!","My sister is diabetic and loves pancakes. Most sugar-free pancake syrups are made with sorbital, which can cause extreme digestive system problems. I found this product and thought we'd finally found something she could use, as it was made with splenda. Watch out folks...this is not pancake syrup, despite what it says on the label. It is a liquid flavoring that is added to coffee drinks. It is watery, slightly sweet, and doesn't taste like maple syrup. We were able to get a refund, but it was because the bottles we got were out of date, not because of the false advertising. The seller, Beverage Gourmet, was absolutely disappointing in their handling of our problem. (The manufacturer, to our surprise, was very helpful but ultimately we had to deal with Beverage Gourmet)."
4,Good Movie,"What can I say , I liked this movie and the instant version is good quality. just wished instant movies had subtitles as an option."
1,Pointless B-movie,"This film is so bad the audience were actually laughing near the end (when Viggo drives hundreds of miles through the night). I can't imagine what Cronenberg was thinking. The story is predictable and dull from the opening (poorly acted by the little girl) scene to Mortensen's detached performance. Without the comic book violence and over the top (and painful to watch) sex scenes this film could be made for afternoon TV. There is nothing deep and meaningful here, if you want to see a good movie watch Crash."
2,Most Overrated Film of 2005,"Quite frankly this was not a good movie. Its starts off somewhat interstingly, but then goes nowhere. Ok so he is some ex-gang member trying to find a new life, but thats it that is the only mistery in the entire movie, they dont talk about what he did as a mobster, or show any flash backs of his past. The best part of the movie is when William Hurt gets his brains blown out. Uncut Magazine named this film of the year, I have no idea what movie they saw, but it wasnt this piece of crap. If you want to waste two hours of your life then see this movie.P.S. I was suprised how much I didnt like this, because i really appreciate independent cinema. But I dont see how someone could say this was a good film and keep a straight face."

3,Overrated Garbage,"This movie was so hyped!I saw it in the theater last year and it was pretty weak. It wasn't boring, so it could have been worse, but it certainly isn't a masterpeice. Oh, and what a smutty film. Mortensen rapes his own wife! This film is schizophrenic. The family loves him, they dont, they do, they dont, his son is a nerd, his son is a genetic psycho freak like his dad, then his son is a puss dweeb again.... so bad!The only way I will buy this one is if it ends up in Walmarts 5.00 discount bin. Give it a year and I bet we will see it in the bin!"
2,Also disappointed.,"I agree with ""tomdw"" and his review.I usually avoid detailed reviews of movies so that I don't have any idea of what's coming when I finally watch it. This was no exception. All I'd heard was that it was a good movie. And for the first half of the film, it had it's moments (although the bad-girl sex theme was a bit overdone). The acting wasn't worth writing home about, but the story seemed to have some potential. That potential was unrealized, however, and the last half of this movie was terribly written, terribly uninteresting, and left the film completely flat when it ended.Don't waste your money."
2,"great title, movie doesn't live up to it","Cronenberg made some truly cool cult films in the late 70s and early 80's, very quirky and disturbing ones. this movie is relatively straight forward, the only scene that was eye opening was the uncomfortable sex scene on the stairs which was very original and scary.Overall tinged with disappointment, a little too self aware and should of been much bolder - but good for ""mainstream"" movie I suppose!worth checking out."
1,What makes a good movie?,"I wanted to see this because of the reviews and because of the preview. What you get is 90 slow minutes. It takes a while for the movie to get interesting, and after the climatic scene it goes downhill. I realize there's a message to the film, but without a good plot line to back up the message you have a really boring movie. Violence and blood does not a good movie make.History of violence turned out to be a real disappointment."
2,Absolutely hated it,"I only give this 2 stars because of Viggo Mortenson. I think he is very talented but even he couldn't elevate this stinker of a movie. Nothing in this thing made real sense to me, especially the overly graphic and prolonged sex scenes which added nothing to the movie itself."
2,Maria Makes it a 2 Star Movie.,"If you want to see someone boring on the screen then you will love this movie. Viggo Mortensen should never be allowed to be in a movie, unless it is for those that are sleep deprived.Maria gives the movie it's only zest.If not for her this movie would be a 1 star.The Story is just boredom interlaced with some quick violence,followed with more boredom and some more very quick violence, then a very contrived and ridiculous ending."
2,Here we go again........,"This movie is a joke, actually almost an insult. The characters are thin, the plot is as simple as black and white and the holes in the overall storyline are as big as black holes in space. Does Hollywood sees us as a mindless, brainless, eye candy oriented society? well, I guess so and probably htey are not wrong either. Overall: GARBAGE."
3,Joey Come Lately ?,"This movie wasn't great. This movie wasn't bad. This film isn't complicated. This film isn't oversimplified. If I'm sounding a little mixed , it's because I have mixed feelings about the film.I can say that the film is unique in the way that it captures fabulous acting moments from Ed Harris. Viggo Mortensen, and John Hurt ( OSCAR nominated, for his role in this film ). The story begins to unfold in predictable ways. But this film doesn't shy away from what it is , and Cromberg's brilliance shines in the film's relishment of unfolding the events , before our eyes. All of the characters are interesting and the story maintained my interest until the end. I recommend it , for a Friday or Saturday night. Nothing noteworthy on the dvd. Just the basic extras. Moreover, the title reveals the content , so it's not for the squeemish or kids. But if you like simple , and interesting little films..this one comes highly recommended."
3,Title says it all.,"The title pretty much says it all. Based on a graphic novel, it's not nearly as violent as Sin City, but much more realistic; not nearly as original and stylish as Road To Perdition, but more contemporary. It's about a small town family man (Viggo Mortensen) who draws media attention with a heroic act of violence (ok, a violent act of heroism). A mobster (Ed Harris) accuses him of being a former Mafia killer in hiding. This leads to considerably more violence. The story keeps you interested, nothing more. Ed Harris (Milk Money) is effective but I think he would have been great in the lead role. William Hurt (Lost In Space) does a near-perfect Keenan Wynn impression as a loud-mouthed gangster."
2,Brutally Overrated,"I came into this movie expecting something engrossing and overall very rewarding, based on the word of what others have said about it. What I saw could only be called a mess. While I think Cronenberg is at many times a competent filmmaker, this is very much a terrible film. My biggest problem with it stems from the wife. She brings an unneccessary and ridiculous level of drama to every scene she's in, and really distracts from the plot. I wouldn't say that the film drags at any part, but what it does is ignore the aspects that would be the most interesting to the viewer. I was left wanting a lot more fight sequences, and possibly more interaction with the sheriff. It's sad that him and the brother were pushed aside in the story, as they could've in my opinion, saved the film from being a trainwreck. Bottom line, if you want to watch a good Cronenberg movie, give this a pass and check out some of his older stuff like Videodrome."
2,Overrated,"I rented this film after reading that many critics had labeled this one of the best movies of the year. I whole-heartedly disagree. The movie is overly violent, which is fine if that is your thing. Other than that the movie really didn't have that much to offer. The family dynamic really doesn't work - with Tom Stall's family or with his long lost brother. I was flat out disappointed."
3,A Mixed History,"After reading all the rave reviews received by A History of Violence, I was a little disappointed when I saw the film. The first part has the power of things hidden under the surface. But once you find out the truth about Tom Stall, the movie quickly falls apart. As nice as it was seeing William Hurt (where has he been all these years?) the subplot with him was so over the top, it was a little silly."
1,Horrible!,The script and acting were horrible. It was like a high-school play at best. BLECH!!!! I thought it was going to be good and was let down hugely. Very disappointed.
1,Barely made it through,"I hardly made it through this movie. I love Viggo Mortensen, and that's the only reason I stuck with it. The acting was sub par and left a LOT to be desired. Everyone was very monotone and inexpressive. The plot had the potential to be interesting, but wasn't followed through with. The soundtrack also was uninteresting and didn't really add to the film. If you want an interesting action movie, look elsewhere."
1,Graphic Voyeurism,"I happened across this film as a friend was watching it. If extremely brutal graphic violence and sex are your ticket, then maybe you will find this movie enjoyable. I found it utterly disgusting, and in fact, could not sit through the whole thing. My wife made it further than me, but finally gave up on it. This movie is a testimony to the graphic voyeurism that Hollywood propagates today. There is nothing classic or stylish about this film. It just seeks to shock, and bludgeons the viewer with the graphic nature of its content. I am not sure why anybody would find this entertaining."
2,meh,"In some ways an interesting plot, but overall I thought the acting was average at best. The movie is fairly dark and gruesome, though it does have somewhat of a redeeming message mixed in. Also some fairly explicit sex scenes (to the line of being what some would likely consider to be pornographic). If you're mainly looking for a movie with very graphic violence then I think you will probably enjoy this to some degree. If not, then I probably wouldn't waste your time."
2,OK film,"I missed this when it first came out and had only seen pieces of it on TV but remembered that it was well reviewed so when I found a cheap copy of it I decided to take a chance. I was able to watch it all and not be too turned off so I guess it was OK, very violent and a sex scene that seemed pretty weird and a little gratuitous.Certainly not for children and probably not for a lot of adults."
3,"underdeveloped, but good","The film, while underdeveloped compared to how deeper and more detailed it perhaps should have been, is plenty intriguing and intense enough to keep you watching. And in response to Bernardo Sanchez who posed the question, ""Why are people under 20 watching this film?"" I, a mere petty 16 year old, offer the following answer:Because we do not need your permission to enjoy a good film. Get lost."
2,"Interesting concept, but missed the mark","Not a very well written movie. The concept was good. I think Ed Harris should've been the main antigonist. The whole movie just fell flat. It spent too much time in the beginning trying to portray him as a loving family man. We got the idea early on. They didn't have to keep feeding it to us!!! And to be honest with you, the parts are pretty predictable. The problem is that the movie tried to tell the story of the son as well, but, that's the problem. It took you another direction, but didn't finish where it started. So, the story concept was interesting, but the deliverance was terrible."
3,lots of violence,"but very little plot. Also leaves you with alot of questions like 'where did the son learn to fight?', 'how and why did Tom leave his old life' and on and on......Could have been very good, but ends very abruptly."
2,BORING,"This movie was so dull and dry!!! It was boring from start to finish. With the exception of the sex scenes between Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello!!, and the fight scenes with the son and that stupid jock!!! Either than that it was corny as hell!!!"
3,cronenberg grows up,"This is a fairly engaging film, it kept me interested from beginning to end. For me it didn't live up to all the buzz and hype surrounding it but it was entertaining nonetheless. Cronenberg eschews the typical horror genre that he's known for and rather opts for telling a pretty straight forward story. However, in typical Cronenberg fashion we still get some gory violent scenes and of course his obligatory gratuitous sex scenes. You'll still enjoy this if you're a fan of Cronenberg. If you're new to him beware, this is not indicative of Cronenberg's oeuvre."
1,Watch for 2 minutes every 30 minutes...,"Awful! Need to watch of super-fast forward. Not very clever or thought-provoking, just horrible. The special features were better than the movie itself, and that's saying something."
1,"Pretentious title, movie garbage","Pretentious title, movie garbage. I kept thinking, ""This has to be tongue in cheek. He can't be serious."" But apparently he was.What is William Hurt doing in a thing like this? Fortunately, he isn't in it for long.An experienced moviegoer would guess from the casting of the hero everything that was to follow."
1,"Gee,,,I thought i saw this on TV........","Just what the public needs more violence. I guess the war in Iraq, children being kidnapped, raped and murdered, and for another example the daily killings in Hartford Connecticut isn't enough for people to enjoy. Hollywood wants to reinforce even more violence with a film called ""The History of Violence."" I wonder if this is why americans have become what they see and hear on the news? It's getting very scary the types of films that Hollywood is producing. As you know violence becomes violence. We are getting no better than all the other haters in the world. We look back in history to Hitler, Mussalini, Sadam and now regular americans. Think about it people."
3,mainstream cronenberg,"It's Cronenberg, so it's worth watching but it has none of the black horror of CRASH or SPIDER. The ending is obligatory American schlock family value - albeit well acted."
1,Funniest Movie Ever!!,I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. My husband and I were cracking up. This movie is a comedy right? It has to be. No way they were being serious. I wonder if the actors knew they were making such a horrible film when they were filming it. I think this film will be considered one of the greatest comedies of all time.
1,By far...,"The worst movie ever made. I actually sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better. The acting was beyond awful, the story was a joke. I honestly was blown away at how terrible it was, do NOT waste your money or time on this movie."
1,Garbage for all seasons!!,"This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile."
2,stopped frequently,Loved the movie. It continuously stopped to download which was annoying:(The audio wasn't the best either. Thought the movie was terrific.
4,Interesting Twist,Held my interest pretty much throughout - interesting plot twist. Somewhat predicable toward the end but nonetheless entertaining for sure.
3,No disaster...,"...and I didn't have any problem finnishing this flick, but afterwards I didn't know how to feel. And 2 weeks later I'm still like ""Huh?"". You may find it hard to deciede wether the script is very clever, or extremely thin. I will probably watch it again, some movies require that, but the tracks of the movie is not hard to follow, it's the moral. Presented in a realistic way, yet unbelievable. I've heard some people and critics call it moving, personally it would have to reveal far more to move me."
2,Skip it,"My general recommendation is to lower your expectations of a movie and you'll get more out of it, but that does not apply to this film. I will summarize with this: had the ending not been as weak as it was, the overall film would have been ""okay."" The weak ending washed away any and all redeeming characteristics this movie had.Have a few beers and watch a different movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Exceptionally well-crafted scenes of bloodshed (Cronenberg is one of the best directors when it comes to making movie violence seem actually violent) and a stellar supporting turn from William Hurt lift this thriller above the ordinary; it's not a great film, but it is one which will most likely linger in your mind."
1,Boring so very very boring,"It is a sad state of affairs when the most passionate actor in a movie is William Hurt. Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris race each other to complete ambivalence in this story of a man hiding out from his past.Maria Bello plays the victim wife perfectly dull. Mortensen and Bello's love scenes are perfectly orchestrated and have that heavy pendantic feeling of a machine executing its task for the millionth time.Dialogue and scenes have the stilted affect of a high school drama production. Cronenberg may have meant this picture as an stinging indictment of US violence but it only leaves the dull throbbing ache of an overworked message brought to the audience by robots who do nothing and then explode.Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid . . ."
4,Good Movie,"This movie is proof that no matter how long you know somebody, there is a good chance that you never really know them. Tom Stall is a family man. Loved by his town and his community and his family. But, one day changed all that and brought back the true meaning of Karma. Good watcher and for all you guys who love Maria Bello like I do, she worth the watch alone."
1,Hokey piece of garbage,"One star only because I can't give it a zero. This movie is totally unrealistic and adolescent. I couldn't get much past the wife dressed as a cheerleader sex scene -- Wow, that was pretty racy and cutting-edge. And sad. Hokey dialogue, poor acting. Predictable story. What else is there to say? If you want to see a good and very realistic film about the nature of violence, watch Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" with Robert Blake."
1,"Watched with 9 people, not one enjoyed it","The problem with this movie is that it tries to be profound, but is not in touch with the world. Furthermore, it doesn't have the appeal of an action movie with tons of violence and such. It wasn't entertaining, and certainly didn't offer anything else to the audience.Firstly, the son's sidestory is just contrived and lame. High schoolers do not act like that. Whoever wrote the parts for the ""bully jock"" and the son needs to go and watch high schoolers in actual life. I could go on and on, as the movie is all-around poorly cemented in reality.I hoped this movie was going to be action packed, but it wasn't. There were 3 decent action scenes (lasting probably about 2 minutes altogether), and the rest of the movie was unecessary, untasteful sex scenes and poorly written character development and attempts to build some sort of a plot."
1,An embarrassment to cinema,"I'm sure this review will be rated as unhelpful simply because people disagree with my opinion, but I have to tell you this movie was absolutely awful.The synopsis sounds as if it would be really interesting, and I'm sure the graphic novel WAS really well done, but the movie fell waaaay short. Adding ridiculously gross violence and absurd and unnecessary pornographic sex scenes doesn't make a film ""edgy"" or ""gritty"" or ""realistic,"" it just makes it seem almost juvenille in it's attempt to pretend to be art.When I went to see this, SEVERAL audience members got up and walked out of theatre. The saddest part is that this movie COULD have been really good. There really were some themes that might have made for a thought-provoking movie. And of course this is a great director. But this movie is a perfect example of taking a concept with great potential and doing a really really bad job."
2,just ok,"i wasn't feeling this film too tough. it jumped all over the place&never really fully explained itself. the violent nature of the film sells it more than a actual storyline to me. I watched this film the other night trying to put everything into perspective&this film just didn't fully click with me.this film couldn't make up it's min what time frame it was in as well. part of felt like Mayberry&the other part sorta felt like the matrix. it was trying alot of things&mising most of the time,but it had some alright moments."
5,A life after death,"I love this movie, bought it, and have watched it many times. The main character went through a painful transformation to have a life he loves. He ""killed"" himself. He was thrust back into his old world by his act of bravery. His life will never be the same again no matter what else he does. He has to be both the family man and the killer in the end. His son may have the same natural violent ""talents"". No organized religious redemption but, he does take a cleansing dip before going back to his family. In the last scene, he looks up at his wife searching for the love in her eyes that he spoke of earlier in the film.A History of Violence [Blu-ray]A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)"
1,A History of Cliches,"I don't think the director missed a single cliche in making this film. Hidden identity, kid in trouble at school, wife hates him, then comes to love him through passionate lovemaking, etc., etc. A BIG disappointment and a waste of time."
1,Not as good as critics say,I didn't really enjoy this film. I have never written a review but I felt this one deserved my attention. I can't understand why the critics liked it so much. It's just ok from my point of view. Looks like Vigo's sleeping with the critics or something. :o)
1,They took my review down,I wrote a review of this that was so bad they took it down. Email me at willhiteperry@hotmail.com for complete analysis.
1,Boring and Pointless,"I talked my husband into watching this movie because I was sure with that cast and the plotline advertised it would be good. Boy, I could not have been more wrong. The movie did not flow together well, it was difficult to follow, and there were so many holes in the plotline you needed to have Michael Jordan airtime to negotiate them. The ending had no resolution, and the sex scene was totally gratuitous. And I also agree with the reviewer who said the wife and her reaction was not realistic. Don't bother with this - I'm amazed and disappointed that this could have possibly made Amazon's top 100 list, and so high on the list."
3,Crowd Pleaser Left Me Bored....,"I want to be clear, I did not hate this movie - however I did not love this movie, nor did I even really enjoy this movie. With all the hype and my heightened expectation I rented A History of Violence KNOWING I would be wowed. But I wasn't - not even close. I really felt disconnected from the plot in this movie - often an unbelieveable story becomes plausible with the right direction and the careful unfolding of plot - this was not the case for this film. Our story jumps so violently from it's hum-drum pace to flat our action, and our characters digress so quickly from loving family members to monsters that I find it difficult to believe or enjoy. I see this film as ""a ground breaking shocker"" to the unjaded, blockbuster film freak who has never ventured far from Bruce Willis or Tom Hanks, however for those of us who long left the safety of the shores of Hollywood this film just doesn't cut it."
3,I feel sorry for Maria Bello,"She acted her heart out in this film and turned in a memorable performance. To see that effort wasted by Cronenberg - especially by allowing the phone-it-in overacting of William Hurt - is a shame. The film was entertaining enough but was a little too earnest in establishing the ""perfect Americana"" family in the Stalls. If Joey was a one-time vicious sociopath, how is it that three days in the desert can remake him into a model of family stability - merely by trying hard? It would have been better had he truly been insane and ""Tom Stall"" been the construct of a fractured mind. Ed Harris was convincing and menacing, nicely done, but Hurt, Mortensen and Cronenberg should have watched a few more season I/II episodes of The Sopranos, it could only have helped. Again, I will add a half-star for the performances of Bello & Harris, but no way did this film deserve nominations beyond their contributions."
1,laughable,"Hey Cronenberg,Good one! This was a joke, right? You made this movie thinking ""I'm a director with a cult following, lets see what sheep my fans really are...""Sure enough the flocks are following. Good reviews for an absolutely amateur, insultingly bad film.After the first 10 minutes, I couldn't stop laughing - it was SO bad! Dialog was a joke; the plot was riddled with holes, the sex scenes were, well - as pointless as they were confusing. Really, just insulting to think anyone with half a brain could buy in to this crap.Did he seriously have a scene where the wife put on a cheerleading outfit and actually said lines like ""you are the most wonderful man I have ever known""...seriously? And that's in the first 10 minutes - I knew I was in for a painful hour +.Someone said it right, get this movie - own it. Why? It's destined to be a cult classic because of its absolute ridiculousness."
2,"Overrated ""Violence"" Misses the Mark","Imagine if Fritz Lang or Alfred Hitchcock had a crack at ""A History of Violence."" The legendary filmmakers certainly would have jettisoned screenwriter Josh Olsen's sloppy adaptation of the popular graphic novel. David Cronenberg, on the other hand, goes full speed ahead - embracing the needless subplots and gradual implausibilities. There are effective performances by Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt, but it's all for naught. Wildly overrated upon release, this disappointing crime-thriller was deservedly panned by some of the more-perceptive critics."
4,Highly Recommended For Non-Squeamish Thinking Adults,"This is an excellent film - it's exciting, thought provoking, unpredictable and has some great performances. I think that it's significant that most of the people who have been strongly critical of it appear to have an inability to spell even the most basic words. The perceived faults (which I totally fail to recognize) almost certainly lie in their lack of IQ and imagination."
1,Huh?,"I don't understand how this managed to make so many end-of-year best movie lists. The story is contrived. Some of the dialogue is laughable. The violence is so graphic that it's disturbing, for no apparent reason than shock value. The only good thing I can say is that it contains the best use of a cheerleader uniform I've seen in a long time. You've got better things to do with two free hours."
1,What movie did they watch ?,"After checking the reviews on this movie, I have to ask ""what movie did they watch?"" I wish I was able to give it zero stars, but 1 is as low as I can go. What a complete disaster of a movie, slow, boring, predictable, bad acting, etc... You name something bad and it is in this sorry excuse for a movie. Don't believe the hype, I got sucked in by all the glorious reviews and critics. I was barely able to stay awake during this ho hum thriller. Buyer beware, I don't even recommend renting this garbage. If you do decide to rent it, see if you also catch yourself saying ""that's it, this is the end?"""
2,One of the most boring of 2005!!,"The only thing to rescue on this movie is the performance of the actors. The direction is excellent and the few special effects on it are great, but the storyline is slow, the dialogues are long and the end of the movie is one of the worst that i had ever seen in my life. The violence in this movie is too much explicit and unnecesary. Is this movie a drama? or an action movie? rent it but don't buy it. This is a movie to see just once in your lifetime."
4,Better than average movie,I don't want to give away the plot. So all I'll tell is this is a story about a family man who becomes a hero in the media. He killed two hoods who attempted to rob his small diner. The attention he received brought trouble into his peaceful existence.I disliked the son. Not just because he's a bit of a wimp but also a whiny sort of guy. This a is pretty good film. Both plenty of action and tight plot. I recommend it.
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE Movie!",I was so excited to see this movie because I love the actors that are in it - but what happened? Did they all forget how to act? And what was up with that near porn sex scene? It was a horrible movie and I would not suggest it to anyone. The great actors in it should be ashamed!
2,I just had to make a comment re this film..,I was looking forward to a very good film.....was I disappointed.The best part of this film was William Hurt and then it's over.Acting was strained. The little girl is a poor actresse....where is Dakota Fanning when we need her?The son was not convincing.One scene...Belo (mother) is going nuts with a shotgun in hand and the boy is quietly eating cereal in the kitchen and the little girl saunters down stairs.????????The stair scene is almost embarrassing and I don't mean sexually.Bello coming out out of the bathroom full frontal nudity..why?...could have been better placed in the film....if needed. Gratuitous IMO.Convuluted is one word that comes to mind after seeing this film.This film is not tight. A lot of things in this film just don't make sense.Does not come close to being in a running for an award.Had I paid $10 or so to see this film I would not be happy.
1,You've gotta be kidding me!,"I just rented and watched this movie, and I seriously can't believe the good reviews it's gotten, and not just from here. It's a movie with a plot so full of holes, it should have been called ""Moth-eaten"". Dumb overacting, silly scenes between Tom and Edie, and I don't believe for a minute it would have taken so long for the bad guys to find Tom, especially since he was living in a small town! A total waste of time, IMO."
4,A Minor Classic,"This is another classy film from director David Cronenberg. Its a compelling story of a normal guy running a Coffee bar who's life changes dramtically when some nasty characters turn up late one evening and try and rob the place.This is cleverly done, excellently acted, especially by Ed Harris and William Hurt in their supporting roles. The film is concise being just over 90 minutes, and certainly I couldn't predict where it was going. Cronenberg as always directs with his unique style. This film is certainly more mainstream than most of his, but it is in a different class from your average Hollywood thriller.Whether the premise of the film is believable or not is irrelevent; this is a great piece of entertainment from the spooky opening right through to the end. The film is probably nearer 5 stars for me, and further viewings will no doubt confirm this."
2,One of a number of conversations........,"This is one of a number of pre-production conversations that should have taken place (and obviously didn't)Cronenberg:""Uh...remember when on page 22 Tom has the run-in with the two guys at the diner?""Scripwriter:""Yeah..""Cronenberg:""And remember how it brings flocks of reporters to his Diner and local,regional and national media attention?""Scripwriter:Uh ...Yeah..""Cronenbeg:"" and then on page 55 here...you have him and his son killing 3 presumed Gangsters in the families front yard and apparently there are NO repercussions of any kind...legal,media ....NOTHING!????""Scriptwriter:""Uh...Yeah..""Cronenberg:""UH YEAH!!!!!!!!!!THATS IT???""Scriptwriter:""So....you think we should maybe change that or sumpin?""As I said ..one of a NUMBER of conversations that should have,but didn't take place."
4,Entertaining indeed with a surprise ending,"I really enjoyed this movie because it was well written, and was very believable.I rate it a 4 because of the way the movie ended.I won't give that part away; I'll let you see it for yourself.Give it a shot. It's worth the price, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.Also remember this when reading a critic's critique: A critic is one with NO talent, judging those WITH talent.--James Michael Collins--"
3,Do we really know the person we love?,A History of Violence began as a movie ripe with possibilities.How do you come to terms when the person you love isn't who they pretended to be. This theme is also a parable of marriage as married couples eventually discover the truth about one another after the infatuation wears off.This theme alone was enough to carry the movie into an excellent character study but instead it veered back into a retaliation movie with one dimensional cutout villians.The best scene in the movie was the violent sexual scene just after the wife discovered her husband had been lying. At that point the movie took a wrong turn never to recover. Director Cronenburg missed the boat and took the easy way out.Ed Harris and William hurt played too fierce (laughable) roguesthat took away from instead of adding to the power of the move.Death Wish type movies by the like of Charles Bronson have already been made and done much better.
3,Both contains and lacks impact,"A History Of Violence is a much better movie than I was made to beleive. It's fast paced,short,graphical and unpredictable. Watch this once. I don't know if one should buy this but it's definitely worth a watch or rent."
5,A History of Violence,"Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you have not watched this movie you need to. An awesome performance by Viggo Mortenson. Truly made me do a double take on him as an actor. David Cronenberg did an outstanding directorial job also, and I really enjoyed his commentary!"
1,What the hell happened ???,"I just watch this movie and i still dont get it. Its basicllypointless. The movie dosent go anywhere and dosent give any thing. It is a gory movie but i wouldnt call it a thriller, at all!!!Besides it seems like the actors were reading there line off cue cards.I do not recomend this movie."
3,The first half is quite good then it is just silly,"This is an example of a film that goes down a track that is terribly wrong. It really should be redone.What we have is a average person whose shop gets held up by a couple of killers. He overcomes the killers, saves the people in the shop and becomes a hero. Then later on a few hitman come to town thinking that he is a former hitman. It causes conflicts. Finally our hero and these hitman argue, fight and eventually the truth comes out that he used to be a criminal too. From then on the story goes down hill fast into sillness.The acting is okay. The special effects not much."
1,Friends don't let friends watch this movie...,"You've got to be kidding - 3.5 stars? Showgirls. Showgirls was the only other movie that comes to mind that was more painful to watch than A History of Violence.Need I say more?Ok, yes, maybe I do. Joey the mobster from Philly? C'mon. How the hell did Ed Harris & Viggo Mortensen get sucked into doing this movie?Sad."
2,Kinda sucky and smelly,"This wasn't the worst movie this proud female reviewer has ever seen. But it left me wondering why I bothered with it for an hour and half. No pay off of any kind. The highly illogical ""story"" barely makes coherent sense. This is the kind of movie that film snobs think they're supposed to like and will spout off all kinds of pretentious crap about how deep it is. Bull. This stinker wishes it was actually about something, but it doesn't wind up being anything remarkable. And I can't believe William Hurt was Oscar nominated for such a brief, hammy, over-the-top role."
2,Not enough of a Payback,"The plot had a lot of potential, but it ended up being a short, predictable flick with lots of meaningless violence. They tried unconvincingly to make you believe that Viggo wasnt actually the guy the mob was after. All of the good, tense, dramatic moments were in the trailer (like a bad comedy where all the good jokes are in the trailer). If you're in the mood for violence, watch Gibson's Payback instead."
2,Recommended by a friend.,Too predictable. I figured our the plot in five minutes. You win some you loose some. Whatta ya going to do?
3,Decent Drama,"I was expecting more action from this movie. It turned out to be more of a drama, with a couple minutes of violence. It was semi-realistic, and entertaining enough to not turn it off, which is a lot more than I can say for many of today's movies.I don't really see the benefit in owning the dvd, as the best viewing is the first."
5,Simply Awesome,"No need to say much since there are hundreds of reviews. Just wanted to chime in and say to all of the people that did not gave this a 1, 2 or 3 star rating must have been watching a different movie.This was a GREAT movie. Good story line. Excellent directing. Superb acting. Fairly short fim but we get deep in to each character.Ed Harris was Great, Viggo was Great, Maria was awesome..whoever played the son....William Hurt played a great ending cameo....simply awesome.I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars if Amazon would let me ;>)"
1,Boggus Artist Listing - Save Your Dough!,"This is a various artists comp falsely listed on several sites as the Bad Surfer Podsters (you should have guessed from the silly not-a-real-bandname listing). These are all old masters. The Beach Boys tracks here are pre-Capitol, and have been out in a million forms. The instrumentals are a mix of old studio sessions (not bands) and seventies remake studio projects (also not bands). Not recommended."
2,Nice photography of beautiful pregnant women,"Don't get me wrong, I think the photography in this book is very well done and some of the photos are very interesting, but I think it can be a rather depressing book for the basic female population.I am an OB/GYN and I constantly see women who are concerned about their weight or their body image when pregnant and I dont see this book as being very helpful. I see famous models and wives that are pregnant but not reflective of the general pregnant population. I think they should have shown the woman that weighs 180-200 lbs or the woman with stretch marks and how beautiful they can be as well.I would not consider placing this in my waiting room for fear of a riot from my patients. I think all pregnant women are beautiful and they dont need to spend (money)on a book that shows them......they need to be told by their spouses.Spend the money on ""What to expect when you're expecting."""
3,pretty good soy thriller,"The acting was average, the dialog was cheesy at times, and the story was ok. All that gets it a watchable 3 stars."
3,"Good, bad and Ugly...","Long and confusing plot....difficulty in following the good and bad guys. if you have patience and enough time, you can watch this movie."
5,Truly Amazing,"My friend, Ruth Mast, gave me a bottle of these. Being on the end of alternative medicine, I was not skeptical. However, I did know that the doctor had said that my pain would be chronic. I've had loss of energy and chronic pain since a bad car wreck almost two years ago. After an hour and a half of taking ONE CAPSULE, I was cleaning my house and had the zest that I had once had. I do not that I am still having sciatic pain while sitting here, so I will see what happens after taking the capsules for a month."
3,Ok I guess,"I used these grape seeds for two months after recommendation of a healing touch friend to see if they would lower my blood pressure any, but did not see any improvement. The reviews I read conducted by bowman grey hospital research group were not definitive either, so I gave up after 8 weeks."
4,StretchCordz,"Works great! For beginning or intermediate swimmers the 15lb cord would be much more appropriate. Comfortable to use, great workout. This product is designed for a strong swimmer because the resistance ramp of the cord is fairly steep. Perfect for a backyard pool."
1,Horrible excuse for safety gear!,"My daughter got these knee pads and elbow pads with the Disney Princess helmet. They are complete junk. They don't fit well and do not shape around the knee or elbow at all. My son has a set of Hot Wheel pads that are a million times better than these. When my daughter wears these I have to strap them so tight to get them to stay in place that it hurts her and leaves red marks, but when I put them on her comfortably they slide all over and stay stiff and straight. They are a giant watse of money. If your daughter is a huge Princess fan and has to have these you might as well cut out a cardboard Disney Princess logo and strap it to your kids legs it would be cheaper and might work better."
4,philly rap,"if you like philly rap,thats ol skool and is real hip hop,then grab this,you wont be sorry"
5,Great Little Set of Chopsticks,"I was looking for a nice simple set of chopsticks that wasn't too expensive and these fit the bill perfectly. I have had them for about a month now and they are great. I love the way they feel and they hold up great. I have used them for cooking as well and they show no signs of any wear. I have small hands so I hold them just after the twist part with no trouble at all. I saw that some people thing the twist is weird for them but I don't even notice it. I love these, I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice cheap set they can re-use as an alternative to disposables."
5,great value bamboo chopsticks,"Can't eat foods from the far east without chopsticks like these, so much nicer than cheap throw aways! Great deal, great shape, very nice buy."
5,Very nice chopsticks,"We do not like paint over chopsticks and these are perfect for us. They are light and durable. We even put them in dishwasher (It was noted handwash only, but we got lazy) for a number of times. The chopsticks only look slightly color-faded. Other than that, they were all fine."
1,avoid,"They are laminated, have very strong chemical smell even after ""cooking"" them with hot water. I throw them away because I am afraid those chemical may harm the health."
2,Slippery Suckers,"These are very elegant chopsticks, but using them has proved to be a pain in the butt. The coating they have used makes the chopsticks very slippery and it is difficult to pick up food. Now, I'm a self-professed non-expert when it comes to chopsticks, but even my boyfriend (who prefers chopsticks to silverware) has a hard time with them. I suggest you spend the few extra dollars to get ones without the coating."
1,Not what is pictured,"I purchased these from MV Trading here on Amazon thinking they were the branded ""Totally Bamboo"" since that was pictured, what I received was generic packaging. Examining the chopsticks, yes they are bamboo and have a twist, but they are also lacquer coated. Having used chopsticks since the age of 3, I specifically did not want chopsticks with a lacquer coating. The lacquer falls off in your food and in your mouth. Considering these are from China, who knows what is in that lacquer.I did not get what I paid for which is the Totally Bamboo brand. What I received was generic, low quality and coated with an unknown substance. It's not worth the cost of shipping to send it back. Big disappointment."
1,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!,"11/14/12: I bought this item from M V Trading here on Amazon, and what arrived was a totally different brand of chopsticks. I had purchased them on the presumption that they were by ""Totally Bamboo"" - what I got was some off-brand, no-brand set. VERY disappointed! Not worth the third-party seller hassle and charges to return - so shafted. Thanks for nothing."
4,Nice,"These I really liked. made out of real bamboo and the twist is so creative, definitely worth the money. :)"
2,warped,These aren't really straight; they're actually quite warped. I haven't had them long enough to know if the lacquer will chip off.
4,Chopsticks,"These are a nice product. One set of chopsticks had a warped bend to them. Other than that, happy with them."
3,healthy fats,"Full of healthy omega fats, but contains fewer sardines than most per tin (3 instead of 4). Hot sauce is a misnomer - should be 'mild' sauce. Still, good value."
5,Enlighting,"Practical book, written in detail about great health benefits about foods and how and when to eat them! Thank you Edgard Cayce!!!!"
4,"Very soothing, almost inspiring","Incredibly beautiful voices, soothing almost mesmerizing cadences, too bad it is all in Latin. I recognize a few words but would enjoy an english version."
2,DVD-production disaster,"The story is entertaining enough, but there is not much joy from viewing this DVD. The problem is that the folks producing it apparently were trying to win the contest for the DVD having the world's squattest image. It is EXTREMELY letterboxed WITHIN a 16:9 widescreen format. Even your zoom function won't help you, because the producers moved the subtitles into the black-bar region (and the subtitles are about 2/3 the height of the image itself. The movie becomes simply uninvolving when you see low-resolution images on a thin ribbon across the screen."
3,"Starts well, loses steam","Catherine Deneuve's character is a mail-order bride who finds herself the wife of a handsome, sexy, rich plantation owner. He quickly falls in love with her. (Spoiler warning! Read no more if you can't see this coming.) Spends money like water. Pampers her. Most of us would kill to be in her pumps. Trouble is, she has. Once this becomes clear, the film, I think, starts to lose steam. I didn't find his behavior, after he tracks her down, believable. The first half-hour, as daydream material while at your desk in some death-like job, is terrific."
3,Mississipi Mermaid.,This film was made by the great Francois Truffaut. It is worth seeing just for Jean-Paul Belmondo and the young and beautiful Catherine Deneuve.
3,The Rip Off is Better,"I think Original Sin - the rip off is much, much better. It stars Angeline and Antonia Banderes. Catherine Denuve - or whatever - CD is a boring actress. And I think she's like an ice zombie - and I don't think she's beautiful - though all the males I know disagree. I think Angelina (who is not a zombie) and Antonia are so very much better in Original Sin. My reommendation? Get both and compare"
2,Misfit,"Unlike some other reviewers I read here, I have never met a Truffaut movie I've cared for. I 've tried: I mean, the guy is SOoooo famous. But Mississipi Mermaid epitomizes the disappointment I 've had with every Truffaut movie: odd casting, bad dialogue (I mean: the switches in French from Vous to Tu between wife/husband in 1969 are just plain grotesque!), hideous soundtrack overblown and overwhelming, incoherent story development...and add to that here a detestable DVD transfer with squiggles and blurs. Whooof! What a mess! But thank god for Belmondo and Deneuve, at least...."
1,ho-hum,"Unfortunately, this book is doing nothing for me. Not only is it very slow and the minute details are so painstakingly expanded on, but I feel so distant from the main character, and find myself not caring about anyone in the story, when I really want to. I'm not really sure where this book is going, and the ""mystery"" behind the duchess's silence is really down-played. Of course, I'm not done with it yet, but so far, the book hasn't really addressed the mystery or expanded on it to make you want to figure out what happened to her. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to finish this one, and I'm the type of reader who wants to finish every book I start! It's really too bad, because I had such high hopes for this novel!"
2,"Flexible Yes, But Not Easy to Grip","These mitts are more flexible than some others I've tried, but I don't find them to be easy to use. Gripping a pot or pan is difficult with one glove, a little easier with two. Silicone doesn't pick up heat from the pan, but it makes my hands sweat. I returned these because they're not as comfortable as others that have cloth lining."
2,terry is better,"Nice in theory. However, they don't really prevent heat from getting through to your hands, so if you have to hold something for a prolonged amount of time, I'd look for something else. The part I hate is that the thumb isn't placed on the mitt the way it is on your hand, so gripping is basically done with your two palms. It just doesn't feel safe. I sent mine back, and bought some heavy duty terry welding mitts for the same price. They have been much more satisfactory."
5,just what I wanted.,"I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter. I like the handy size of the book and the fact that even though the book is small, the print is easily readable. The binding appears to be sturdy. My daughter was delighted to gt it."
4,Am I going to read this?,"I purchased this with the full and ardent intention of reading through the entire corpus of Shakespeare, in the order the plays and poems appear, in this seminal volume.I've already quit, and I didn't even begin.I just hate Shakespeare, and you can't make me like him.I may try to come back to this, though. I don't know.Notes on the volume itself: the font is smaller than I wish it were, but this is what you have to have if you want a manageable volume in terms of size (as this is). Also, I wished the volume would have footnotes defining difficult terms on each page; instead, we get a dictionary in the back--wish is very useful, but requires a lot of flipping.Good luck."
2,Fake reviews,"Actually this bear was bought after reading super nice reviews.I think they charge too much for it, First of all its not Soft as the reviews mention before, secondly, its just an average looking bear, not very CUTE. I do like the huge size, but color isn't too good either, I will obviously keep it as it was a very thoughtful gift from my better half and I don't want to disappoint. But for future buyers, please note that the previous reviews seem to be written by seller only.. They aren't true."
4,HUGE Bear,"First off..this thing is huge! I bought this for my girlfriend for valentines day. She loved it!The bear itself is very soft but the fur isn't as soft as the picture makes it look. The fur is kind of ""wirey"" feeling. Sometimes the fur sheds a little as well.The bear is very durable! I bought mine in 2007 and it's still going strong. My two miniature dachshunds now enjoy playing and biting the bear! Surprisingly the bear does not have a hole in it yet!"
4,Loveable bear,"This bear was better than described. We got it for our grandson's birthday next month. Meanwhile our ""Cubbie Bear"" keeps us amused as my husband never knows where he'll show up next, in his chair, in his side of the bed. . . Can't help but love this bear."
5,More than worth the price...,"Bruiser is easily one of the most beautiful bears I've ever seen and yes, as stated before, the pictures don't do him justice. Personally, with his size and gorgeous bi-color fur, the bear is definitely not just for cuddling - he makes for an impressive decoration article as well, since he's ""stuck"" in the sitting position and doesn't topple over every now and again. Great product."
5,Excellent Product!,"This was a great product! Every kid in the room was drawn to it like a magnet. They each took turns nestling in on Bruiser, usually with their thumb in their mouth or singing a little song. We adults were floored that all the kids just loved him from the 1 year old birthday girls up! I'm so glad I bought Bruiser for my nieces!"
5,A different twist,"It took a couple of listens to get used to these songs without Peter or Phil at the vocal spot, but the musicianship is superb and the arrangements grow on you quickly."
4,Intersting Versions of Old Favorites,Mr. Hackett surprised me with the arrangements of these songs. fun and different The guitar solo on Firth of Fifth is one of the best ever recorded.
5,Wow what a treasure,"I was not expecting much from this cd.As soon as I began playing it my opinion skyrocketed.The interpetation of the Genesis's songs presented here is fantastic.Several of the songs have John Wetton,on vocals.Again what a pleasant surprise.If you like the Gabriel,era Genesis,you are going to like this cd very much."
4,awesome sound,"I bought it yesterday, along with 3 other SACD Surround 5.1 Dylan releases. The sound is impressive. Dylan's voice in the center channel...like he's in your living room. Discussing the music is redundant...the songs speak for themselves. It's a classic in the true sense, but you've never heard it like this!"
5,"One of the great albums, only better on SACD","What can I say, this is one of Bob's best albums, along with Highway 61 Revisited & Blood on the Tracks in my humble opinion, and is ranked as one of the best ever by critics. What surprised me is how revelatory the SACD version of this album is. When played back on an SACD machine the mix just opens up, and you realize that this is one of the most nuanced, and perhaps best played rock albums of all time. The increase in listening enjoyment from the CD version is immense. You won't believe how much of the music you've been missing on a regular CD. If you have an SACD player, buy this album now!"
1,GREATEST ALBUM EVER but lousy record company cuts song short,"This is my all time favorite album. Great songs, unbelievable creativity and vision, Wild Mercury Sound. But the lousy record company puts both albums out on ONE disk, shortening ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" by about five minutes. That stinks. Stick to the LP. Someday the clueless drones who run Columbia might get a clue. Probably not."
5,A Dylan landmark album,"Dylan sure has made some great music over the decades. He revolutionized Folk music and classic rock. But this is one of his best. Not much more that can be said for this great album, but the lead-off track, ""Rainy Day Women #12 & #35"", is the ultimate drinking song. Gosh, Dylan must have had several thousand beers before recording this. Great track...great album overall. Get it."
5,Sounds great!,"Looks good, sounds good. A little crackley, but I think it adds character. The songs on this album are some of Dylan's best, no doubt!"
3,"Great songs, not a great album","I hear people call this a great album. It's really not. It has some of Dylan's best songs--I love ""I Want You,"" and ""Visions of Johanna"" and ""Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat"" and everything else--It's just that there's no continuity as an album, it doesn't flow easily. I love Dylan, I have most of the stuff he's released, and this one just doesn't stack up to John Wesley Harding, Bringing it All Back Home, Blood on the Tracks or Time Out of Mind. Get those first and come back to this if you're still hungry."
3,Has potential,This young man has a rather nasally voice which detracts somewhat from the songs. The CD cover is rather dull and has a retro look. This CD hasn't been getting much radio play -- perhaps something like a duet with the newly-pop-styled Jewel might help to propel this budding Gordon Lightfoot-like young crooner's career forward.
3,Dyed Blonde...,"So, this was the big Dylan album, the one everybody (including my parents) rave about. I bought this 6 months ago and listened to it.. and no matter gow much I try I just cannot except the hype surronding this album. I admit that I perfer Dylan at either his folky (freewhellin) or more mellow (John Wesely Harding) best, but even so, having bought most of his work I have to conclude that this is one of the least played albums I own.Get his first four albums, get john wesely harding, check out Oh Mercy or forget the past and go for Time out of mind, all of the above offer a more pleasurable listen then this pure average offering from the great one"
5,Quintessential Dylan In Your Face,"I finally purchased Blonde on Blonde at the age of 55. The CD was lurking on the back of a fixture at Tower Records at a seriously reduced price. When I took it home I found that I actually knew the words to Stuck Inside of Mobile and Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands. Visions of Johanna was mystical and Rainy Day Women reminded me of the Village where I graduated dissolusioned and frustrated. Dylan supercedes excellence, he magnifies a persumptuous and arrogant artistry. This is as close to perfect that an album can get. It is visionary and musically intriguing with every single cut slapping you demonstratively in the face. Blonde on Blonde is a voyage through a glib and sardonic period in which Dylan chants an outrageous soliloquy of pure unadulterated greatness. Jay Adler, Massapequa, New York."
5,flawless,"what needs to be said, really, that hasn't already been said a million times. this is one of the greatest albums of all time - and arguably Dylan's best. i say it is, but everyone has their favorites, and with an artist like Dylan, it's hard to pin down one album as his best. either way - if you dont own this, you should be ashamed. take a hint from jack black in high fidelity - if you dont own it, dont let anyone know!as for the audiophile discussion that's been popping up - this sacd hybrid sounds spectacular, and if you're one of those people that really like good sound, it's worth a repurchase, even if it is a bit pricey. however, if you TRULY want the best sound for this album - go with the 180 gram mono mix reissue from Sundazed vinyl. on a good turntable, nothing digital can hold a candle to it.but, whatever your poison, this is a timeless classic that only gets better every time you hear it. six words of advice - buy it. buy it. buy it."
2,Bad Information,"This is for Super Audio CD, I got to know this technology existed when I got this CD and couldnt play it. You should inform about this because this is NOT a popular technology and very few CD players can play it."
5,"A question for Mr. President, if you please.","What I want to know is, why isn't Bob Dylan the Poet Laureate of the United States?"
5,I was stuck inside the mobile and never able to come out :),"This is the first Dylan album That I heard 15 years back when I was A teenager in 90s. The first thing that came in my mind, ""boy, he writes in my words; it's the hope ,Joy, depression, cry of mine....""...I was stuck inside the mobile :) ......Love you Bob...."
4,Usually overrated,"A very good CD, of course, but look somewhere else for the real thing : ""The freewheeling"", ""Highway 61"" and ""Subterranean Homesick Blues""."
4,a Dylan classic? maybe,"I realize Blonde on Blonde is one of Bob Dylan's most popular and greatest albums, but there's a few songs that prevent me from giving it a really high rating. Don't get me wrong- the majority of the album is fantastic, but it's not flawless. ""One Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later)"" is one of those average songs I can't get into. Of course everyone likes the lyrics because they're good, but the melody doesn't do a whole lot for me. Dylan was never about melodies anyway, was he? Well, you could argue he has plenty of good vocal melodies anyway. In fact, the rest of the album has great lyrics AND melodies. ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" is BRILLIANT both lyrically and musically. I don't think the song goes on for too long either. I also don't understand everyone's sudden obsession disliking ""Rainy Day Women"" either. It reminds me of the Kinks! Still, ""I Want You"" is my personal favorite. GREAT song."
2,Botched Remaster,"Did anyone at CBS/Sony listen to the finished product before they started shipping it? The CD layer is painful! Highway 61 isn't much better, leaving me totally astonished. This steals the dubious honor of ""Worst Remaster Ever"" from Supertramp's Breakfast in America - quite a feat. How many years do I have to wait until they get it right?"
2,Blonde on Blonde sacd,"This disc was VERY disapointing! The sound quality wasn't much better (maybe worse) then the regular cd issue. Tinny and too bright, it was a very harsh listen to a very well recorded album.Too bad, as I eagerly waited to hear it, especially after the wonderful sounding Rolling Stones sacd's."
2,damaged,"Although the CD arrived promptly, upon playing the disk the first cut (song) did not play.Disks should be ckecked for perfection before shipping."
1,what a gem!,"wonderful, meaningful song titles ""rainy day woman 12# and 35#,???, great lyrics ""but AHHH WOULD NOT FEEEL SOOO ALOOOONE, EVERWABUDY MUST GET STOOONED"", superb vocals that make Keith Richard sound like a opera singer make this the rock phoozle that it is! GO BUY A BEATLES ALBUM INSTEAD!!!"
5,Music to Spackle by,"This is one of my top 5 favorite albums and I am a classical music junkie! I listened to this over and over again this summer while redoing my ceiling.All the songs are good (this is my favorite of the Dylan albums I own -- some I wouldn't bother buying, but Blood on the Tracks and Highway 61 are also must-haves)....I won't go into all the praises on BonB (everyone else has), but I'm specially partial to Visions of Johanna. To really appreciate the lyrics, try listening and writing them down. There are revelations in every stanza, and I'm still 'getting' it after numerous listenings."
5,"Essential music, a brilliant track","If you listen to music, whatever genre, you should own this album. Bob Dylan is arguably the greatest songwriter ever, but he's unarguably the finest storyteller in music's history. He weaves you through his thoughts, takes you on a journey into his life and holds you, breathless, on every note and lyric. It all comes together in Blonde on Blonde. Please buy it, it's unmatched musically."
5,Dylan at his wildest,"As a previous reviewer said, what can you say about an album that starts with Rainy Day Women #12 & 35? From his electric trilogy (this one, Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited), this is the best and, after Blood On The Tracks, his greatest work (though BOTT is a very different album). Dylan once said this album is the closest he got to the ""thin, wild mercury sound"" he hears inside his head; that's the best way to describe the music in this album. Timeless stuff."
5,Huge Collection Of Musical Treasures,"The man, Bob Dylan served up some terrific songs in his lenghty, third-best album. Opening with the pounding glory of Rainy Day Women and moving on to somne of his best cuts like Visions Of Johanna and I Want You. Some over-looked classics also lie here, like Stuck Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again and Lepord Skin Pill Box Hat. Also, Absolutley Sweet Marie seems like it could have been a #1 hit, I wonder what happend. The album closes with the 11:33 Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands, one of his best.This is a great record, pick it up."
5,Just another rave,"On the original vinyl, side 2 of disc 1 was comprised of I Want You, Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again, Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat and Just Like a Woman. Although I have not listened to every Pop/Rock album ever recorded, it is difficult to imagine a more stunning sequence."
5,Whats to say?,"The abum jacket only gives it 4 stars.Use to hand it on the wall.stuck inside of mobile. Like a women , I want you.Every song is like a cicus, the sound just fits.Old school dylan at his best.Sad eyed lady took a whole side and i think less then 12 minutes long. Listen to that song over a nundred times in a row.(had to move the needle)Best Dylan has too many best to try to rate."
3,Botched remaster,"As Dylan fans know, Blonde on Blonde is astonishingly good. It is one of Dylan's best albums and one of the greatest rock & roll albums of all time.Unfortunately, though the packaging is great, the remastering is very disappointing, a far cry from the wonderful Rolling Stones hybrid CDs. To my ears, Blonde on Blonde now sounds much too bright and has a ""metallic"" sounding edge to it. The earlier CD, though not perfect, sounds much better, closer to the original vinyl.I've heard the Freewheelin' hybrid as well, and that too is much too harsh and edgy-sounding. Hopefully Sony will fix this soon!"
5,Rock 'n' Roll perfection,"Rock 'n' Roll perfection can be filed under 5 simple words: Bob Dylan - Blonde On Blonde. This is the album name that you hear someone speak and it just makes you do a full body shiver because you know what it is, who it is, how good it is and you know exactly what those five words mean. The stand out songs, for me anyway, are ""Rainy Day Woman #12 and 35"" and ""Absolutely Sweet Marie,"" but don't just stop there, start there, every song is a masterpiece. Didn't he turn out like six albums in his first year of recording as a rock 'n' Roll artist? I mean, that's a career for most recording artists. Bob Dylan is amazing, the best song writing solo artist, eclipsed over all by only Lennon and McCartney, which offers much room for debate, but his songs are just as meaningful and beautiful as anything The Beatles ever recorded. This truly is Rock 'n' Roll perfection and Bob Dylan is a living legend, nay, a living God."
5,I Always Said,"I always said ""Blonde on Blonde"" was the one Dylan album I would take into exile. I have now been sent into exile and I took ..."
5,Love it,I used this on my hair several years ago and loved it. My hair style changed and I no longer needed it. Recently I changed my style and am so glad I found this. My hair is fine and straight and doesn't hold curl well at all. I hate products that leave a residue on your hair. This not only is great for holding curl but it doesn't feel like you have anything at all on it.
5,The superb album from the singing Cary Grant,"Probably the best but the most underrated singer of our time,Jack Jones has real talent with rare sophistication! This is not an album for kids but for people who knew the taste of lost love. His Version ofgSkylarkhandgYou Must Believe in Springhare especially beautiful."
2,One small step for the great Jack Jones,"This album is a step in the right direction for Jack, comprised of standards as it is, but he still clings to the new style he adopted when he left Kapp for RCA in 1968, and abandoned the sound which had made him a star. When someone starts out on top, but still wishes to reach new heights, he often ends up going the wrong way. Come back to the top where you began and belong, Jack. P.S. I'll take Pete King's strings over this three-piece jazz combo any day."
1,Riches to Rags...,I am only guessing that Jack was in need of money when this album was cut! It is so bad...so off key...so lacking of his gentle touch in songs of the past...so bad...so bad...but mostly...so sad. I am a GREAT Jack Jones fan...AND if he reads this I must tell him...I WILL ALWAYS BE A JACK JONES FAN...but of the voice from the past! Some things don't get better with age! I only hope he made some money with this recording. Now I am going to buy a CD from the 60s and 70's...the REAL Jack Jones.
5,Wonderful Book,"I LOVE these state books and so does my 2 1/2 year old. We live in Georgia, but were given the Oregon book from friends who live there when my son was a baby. He loved it so much and it contains great information about the state....so I looked for one from Tennessee (my home state) and Iowa (his father's home state) and was able to find both. I was thrilled with the books. I even learned things about Tennessee and Iowa that I didn't know. The art is great for when they are young, but the book can grow to a teaching tool as they get older!"
5,"""Hedgehog"" will incite your IMAGINATION","If you have any love of animation at all - the artistry, the depth, the impact - the Masters of Russian Animation volumes are a MUST OWN. In this edition, Norstein's ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" will tickle and please your visual imagination like NOTHING else! I presented this short film to an American suburban community center audience and they were SPELLBOUND! I've owned a lot of films on DVD (and sold a lot - crazy recession), but I'll never relinquish any of the four volumes in this series. NEVER! Enjoy, with my regards."
3,Ipod waterproof case,"This case is for the OLD early version of the Ipod. Don't make a mistake and order it for newer versions or the video Ipods. The hole for the headphone jack is in the middle of the Ipod and newer versions are off to the side. If you've got the correct Ipod for this case it is awesome. It's indestructible, allows you to kayak, surf, swim, whitewater whatever and you're listening to tunes the whole way (get the waterproof headphones also). It definitely doesn't make your Ipod nice and compact but then when your boatin' or surfin' compact isn't the problem it's keepin' it dry and this definitely works!"
3,waterproof,"As I didn't know which IPOD I was buying for, this did not work and they wouldn't take it back. Not very happy."
4,effective but bulky,I was being a bit too cautious when I bought this thinking I would use it for day-to-day use. this much protection is only really needed occasionally (outdoor activities or something).To me it's to bulky and cumbersome for daily use.
2,Otterbox for IPOD Video,"I bought this otterbox to make a water proof ipod mount for my motorcycle. As far as I know it is....was watertight. I had to drill 2 small holes in it to attach a bracket for a ram mount. I used o rings and silicone to make it waterproof. The problem is that this does not let the ipod breathe. This resulted in several lockups with the ipod. No fun riding down the road. I then, in several steps, proceeded to drill ventilation holes to allow the ipod to cool off while riding. Better but still crashing my ipod. What I have now looks like swiss cheese and still does not cool enough to work properly. I have the 30gb, I recently replaced the battery as I thought that may have been a problem and I heard there were some that would cause the ipod to overheat. In short, if you are thinking of doing this, Don't. It looks great and while it works it works good. in the end you will regret it. I ended up fabricating a mount out of aluminum."
5,Great Box,I had to send this back because it didn't fix the 30G Ipod Video but it looked great! The shipping was very fast.
1,rip off,i don't even own this video but just look at the posted run time of 17 minutes....for $80? what could they possibly teach in 17 minutes?
1,Sucked,Worse ancient video ever. I expected something different. I love ancient aliens. This is just a guy speaking in a small box off his computer. Don't buy it anyone!
1,Ancient Astronauts DVD,Very poorly presented. A lecture on a subject not well researched. I would not recommend this DVD if you are expecting something of quality and substance. Waste of time and money.
1,could have...not [stunk]..,"But it does. Apart from the fact its too hard (any game were you HAVE to take lots of time in between game quests and level up is to hard); the control freaking [stinks]! It takes 8, EIGHT! Bottom presses just to tell your char' to do nothing and defend! God help you if you want to attack or move. Why the development team thought that would be a cool interface is beyond me, all I can think is that why didn't bother playing it before release. It may sound minor, but the control is the most important part of a game. You have to use it though the whole thing. If it [stinks], the whole game will."
1,...agh...,"Yay, paychecks in, I'm going to the mall, oh lookie, a new tactics rpg, and look!! it's by Atlus! 45$? sure thing! ...So I go home, put it in, it's sort of interesting... but not really dragging me into it, the way tactics ogre or vandal hearts did... but I press on, because, I did spend money on it...First three battles... Not that difficult, but still, definitely harder then ones from other games I've played, but hey, that's alright, I don't mind a hard game, if it's fun...But it's not, ever... I kept playing hoping for some big moment when I'd think it was all worth it, but it never came, I just wasted more and more hours, finally I beat the game, more out of habit then actually wanting to, as soon as I beat it, I put it back in its case, drove back to the mall, and sold it to the clerk at the store I bought it at for 9$... technically it's not his fault I bought the game, but since he worked at the store I bought it at, I felt I could get some revenge..."
2,Can't say it was wonderful,"Yucki poo.That's the simplest way i can write this. Hoshigami is just not a game i like. The fighting sequences are very predictable, confusing, and L--O--N--G. Also, when equpping, and even hiring characters/mercenaries it can get very confusing and muddled. The only thin i liked(and the part that stopped me from giving this game a zero) were it's very nicely drawn characters."
1,shadow of a bullcrap,This is the most boring book i have ever read in my entire life if only i could have stopped reading it. but no i had to read it for shcool.why would anybody like this book is beyond me its boring slow unexiting and a 12 year old learning how to fight a bull just because his father dies doing it and everybody wants him to do it you got to be fricken kidding me. The good part about this book is at the end where he says he dosent want to fight the bull and he wants to become a doctor. as a matter of fact the only reason why my teacher wanted me to read this piece of crap was because of the ending come on.If you see this book burn it i can't belive that so many people like this crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,I thout it was an ok book.,"I thougt that it was an ok book because it was a exciting,cool and fun book because my class got to do fun projeckes."
1,boring bull,"Story is so slow it's painful. But you get to learn all the intricacies of bull fighting that you never wanted to know it the first place. A coming of age story that includes the glorified details of sectioned animal cruelty. You get to listen to old men trying to convince a kid to be a bull fighter even though they saw his dad killed by a bull. Do yourself a favor, read a different book."
1,I WOULDN'T READ THIS BOOK AGIAN IF SOMEONE PAID ME!,"ok first I wanna say that this book was totally boring no suspense what so ever! Who wants to read a book with a glossary in the back??? Manolo is the son of the greatest matodor in spain who was gored during a bullfight. Now everyone in Spain wants Manolo to be a bull fighter (come on peeps the kid is like 10 and there teaching him to fight bulls? Thats kinda violent isn't it?) Manolo dosn't have an ounce of courage (I guess you would say that he's a ""pretty boy"") he dosn't want to fight the bull. On the day of his bull fight he gives the bull to some one who really deserves to fight. I don't think some one should write a children's book on bullfighting because it is a violent sport it is full of blood and death that shouldn't be tought to children."
4,Shadow of a Bull,"I think this book is pretty good. I wish Maia Wojciechowaska told a little more information about Juan Garcia's fight, but other than that i thought the book was pretty good"
3,I thought book was an okay book.,"Shadow of a Bull was a okay book.It wasn't the best book but it wasn't the worst book.It had lots of action in some parts but then again it got a little boring in other parts.For the most part it was a good book, I'd read it if I were you!"
3,"racist and sexist, but all in good fun","This 1972 American International Pictures (AIP) production is low budget, with stock footage obvious at times. Continuity/consistency issues might be annoying to some viewers; Slaughter's marksmanship, for example, goes from lousy point shooting tecnhique (punching his hand toward the target) to barely missing a baddie in the unnamed South American country. (It was Mexico, obviously, but the production was not allowed to name it because of the host's fears of negative tourism publicity.)Decent soundtrack, though it doesn't live up to themain theme. The interracial love scenes were landmark. Career buddy-cop Don Gordon (Bullitt) does light duty here, but beady-eyed Rip Torn was sleazy and downright homicidal: a worthy adversary. Jim Brown seems much tougher here than he did a year later inSlaughter's Big Ripoff. Better still are strong blacksploitation entries such asShaft,Black Caesar,Truck Turner, andFoxy Brown.Genre rating: 3 stars"
2,Outdated,"If this were 1963, I'd advise you to buy this book. However, it's 2007, and while John Toland did an admirable job researching his material and visiting the various sites made notorious by the public enemies whose exploits he depicted, the fact is that much of the book's contents is old news and simply inaccurate. A fantastic read at the time, but, simply, outdated today."
3,The Dillinger Days,"I give ""The Dillinger Days"" by John Toland 3-Stars for research and photography. Although this book is not the most accurate, it does display information that was available at the time of this publication. Today we have a better factual picture on events of the Dillinger era. Over the years many have bred mythology, speading fictitious imaginary stories creating false beliefs. However, I have to agree with historian and author Rick Mattix, The Dillinger Days is a good starting point for first time Dillinger readers. Good Book!"
4,Has a little bit of everybody in this one.,"I already have plenty of Dillinger books decided to get this anyways. Best decision I could of ever made on a book. This is kind of like public enemies if you've read that but way better, easier read, more info and more accurate information. I've been trying to find a book on the Karpis-Barker gang and so far this is the best I've seen. Although I am confused now because all the books I've read said Ma Barker was a sweet old lady that new nothing of their criminal lives. This book is totally the opposite saying she mastermind alot of the bank jobs and even got her hands dirty in killing her ex- husband (I think thats what he was) Dunlope. So know I gotta figure it out myself."
3,Ok but not great,"John was pretty much on the money in dexcribing that this is not a book entirely about Dillinger but about the crime wave that hit the Midwest in the mid 30's and the various gangsters that were a part of it. My complaint about the book is that it read more as a travel log or calendar of events of the various gangs exploits, ie Dillinger and company went there, robbed bank, went here to hide out. It does not in any detail investigate the personal motivations of each of the gangsters or the people that helped and sympathized with them or the social situation in the country that helped spawn them. In other words, its not a very deep book. If you are looking for a timeline or an introduction to the events that made up this period in US history, its ok. If you want to understand why it occured, look elsewhere."
4,Dillinger Days,"John Toland is probably best-known for his military histories, particularly those dealing with World War II. He is often praised for his narrative style, but has been criticized for his occasional lapses in historical rigor. Both commentaries apply to The Dillinger Days. Though it primarily deals with John Dillinger, this book encompasses all of the major figures of the Depression-era crime wave, including Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barker gang, among many others. Toland gives more than adequate background on all of the major players and their various associates, and does an excellent job of keeping the reader from getting confused by the large and revolving cast of characters. He also is on point when it comes to humanizing his subjects without excusing their crimes. This book is a great starting point for any reader who wishes to learn more about these colorful criminals and the ear they helped define."
2,Not As Good As Other Histories,"This is an earlier work by John Toland about the gangsters of the early Depression period such as Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde. Surprisingly for Toland, who military histories have been well reviewed, this book seems to fail both as a history and a narrative. It seems jumbled and meanders at times. There are other good histories of this period and I so I wouldn't recommend this book for the casual non-fiction reader."
4,Fascinating,"This is a well-written, well-reasoned (although slightly dated now) exposition on the beginning chapters of Genesis from a scientific and linguistic point of view. While this reader would have welcomed more scientific info on the origins of life and the universe, the book held together well and provided a large amount of new learning for me."
4,Excellent Presentation. Oversimplification,"Asimov states well the historical probabilities of Genesis, but simplifies it beyond the area of possability.The J and P documents are well stated there, but if that were the whole story between Genesis 1 and 2 creation stories, then why did one of the accounts become apocraphal (much like the Keys of Enoch.)?Other than that, Asimov did a superb job in laying out Genesis as it was, a beautiful myth."
1,What a sad interpretation of things?,This book shows anybody with a little knowledge about anything can write a book and at least can make some money out of it.This book clearly shows the author's inability to understand hindu and his attempt to interpret it it the way he wanted to.It is in many ways an insult to Hindu.
3,Mr. Freeze,Good toy - older version. My boy didn't mind that it wasn't the new version so I think I got what I wanted.
2,was not happy,i was never informed that the sheets were not going to come until january 2008 at the time that i ordered the comforter. now i have the comforter and not the sheets. the sheets were more important. very disappointed for me as well as my son.
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"Beware, the item you are looking at is not what you will recieve in the mail. Yes, you will recieve a skateboarding comforter, but not the one in Amazon's picture. The quality of the one you will recieve is very poor."
3,Boys comforter,"Fair quality, you get what you pay for, has lasted years without falling apart. Definitely got my money's worth. Bought 2 for my boy's, they love them!"
1,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS!,"okay my friend recently purchased this item, and the picture is just awful compared to other lcd tv's out there that supports HD-Tv! the sound is acceptable but the view messes it up for the whole tv. i'm encouraging you not to buy this item, and instead buy the Samsung 20'' 1763 which is much better then this TV"
1,POOR TV FOR BED ROOM,"I BOUGHT THE TV BECOUSE THE 5 STAR REVIEW, I WAS VERY LET DOWN WHEN I HOOKED THE TV UP FOR MY BEDROOM TV. FIRST THE REMOTE WAS VERY SMALL THE SIZE OF A CREDIT CARD, BUTTONS SMALL AND VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. TV IS ABOUT 20 FEET FROM BED, REMOTE WOULD ONLY WORK ABOUT 6 FEET FROM TV, I TRIED TO BUY UNIVERSAL REMOTE TO SOLVE PROBLEM , TV DOSE NOT SUPPORT UNIVERSAL REMOTE CODES.PICTURE WAS VERY DARK EVEN WITH COLOR ADJUSTMENT ALL THE WAY UP.AFTER ALL THAT ONE SPEAKER DID NOT WORK. I HOPE IF YOU BUY THIS TV YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK THAN ME! I ENDED UP BUYING A 20 INCH VIZON VERY HAPPY, NO PROBLEMS"
3,"What happened when, who's related to who?","This book was unique to me, as far as Chaon's writing style is concerned. Composed of countless vignettes that bounced all over the place as to timelines, it was sometimes hard to follow. His top ability at short stories shines thru in this novel; each one is a tiny novella that seemed written with ease on it's own. His detail at character descriptions was enjoyable and certain ones held their own in this book. I read this while in the hospital and even with the countless interruptions, you could go back and move on with the story.I don't think his characters were depressing, as they seemed to be of people I know and followed real life situations. Because of the way this is written, I can understand why people either love it or hate it. I liked it. Can't help but wonder if he will be able to break free of the short story settings, perhaps in his next book. For a first novel, it's impressive."
4,Well-written story,"I thought overall this was a good book. The characters are very well-written, to the point where you can really visualize things in your head while reading it. Where the book lost me a little is all the jumping back and forth, I'm not good with that. I get confused in my head and I have to remember okay which character was doing what when I come back to that part of the story.It's not all rainbows and unicorns, the themes of the book are dark and depressing at times, but it's an interesting story to read."
1,"Maybe it's me, but I couldn't get into this book.","I hate to give a bad review on a book I didn't finish, but I simply was unable to get interested in this book. I tried several times. First, I don't care for the way the author phrases things - I found him excessively descriptive. For me, it felt like he was trying to fill space by overdoing it. Then, he jumped around quite disjointedly - a technique I usually enjoy, actually, but again, it just didn't work for me the way Chaon did it. I very much liked the premise of the novel, so I am going to try yet again, and if I can get past his style enough to get into the story, I will edit this review accordingly. Maybe it will grow on me. I doubt this review is particularly helpful, but as a Vine participant, I needed to write it as part of my agreement with Amazon."
2,"Wait, what was the story with this character again?","Normally I enjoy stories that switch between characters or jump around in time, but this was done poorly in my opinion. The first part of the book jumped around so much between years and characters that by the time the author started writing in chronological order I had no attachment to the characters and didn't really care what happened to them because I was just starting to get over my confusion with the story."
4,Introspective,"I really enjoyed this book. Very introspective. A bit dull at times, but very worthy read."
4,A visual and griping story,"Dan Chaon has a unique style that is both visual(I could see the movie playing in my head) and poetic(his use of words is beautiful). While I did not like most of the characters, I appreciate the complete sketch that Mr. Chaon paints of these characters' bleak lives. Troy Timmens is probably the fullest real character we see and in my opinion the most comprehensible. The book is midly disturbing and depressing, however, I recommend it for the beautiful and unique style and the griping story."
2,Did not capture my attention,"I tried to enjoy this book, but found it difficult to keep going back to."
2,too disjointed for my pleasure,"I just could not enjoy Dan Chaon's *You Remind Me of Me*. I found Chaon's storytelling to be too wordy for me. In addition, he admits to being a short story writer. Therefore, you're sent forward and backward in time, among different characters and their perspectives. I'm not sure he he's trying to do it like Audrey Niffenegger's *The Time Traveler's Wife* but was unsuccessful in doing so.The first three chapters were interesting and I had thought that I would enjoy this book. However, beyond the third chapter (and certain excerpts in other chapters), the story goes downhill. For me, it was troublesome remembering who was who in what year and whatnot.In addition, I found Chaon to be too wordy in storytelling. I had to put the book down for little mental and visual breaks. Plus, I found the characters to be too depressing. It was as if life is just plain dull and there's nothing good coming out of it."
3,Interesting and very unique,"With ""You Remind Me"", Chaon has uniquely intertwined several characters stories into a single master plot. I enjoyed the constant change of perspective from one character to the next, though I found the time line shifts to be a little quirky at times. One thing is for certain: this is a depressing novel. Clearly there exists a deeper message of self-reflection, but for an upbeat spirited person such as myself-- I'd refrain from reading this one on a rainy day."
2,So depressing,"I didn't finish the book, and usually I wouldn't write a review for a book I didn't even finish. I just feel like I want to warn people about how bleak and depressing this book is. It just makes you sad. The writing is good, but reading it actually made me depressed. I am not a moody person. The book is just a major downer."
3,Read it if you enjoy Oprah Books and melodramas,"Books like this are a dime a dozen which is not necessarily a bad thing. This was not an ""Oprah Book Club"" book, but it is the type that would make it to the list. Perhaps in the beginning it is a little hard to follow but the patient reader will be rewarded with clarity if she continues reading. Not bad but nothing special either.It certainly provides lots of discussion topics if you belong to a book club."
2,i wish i hadn't read this......,"What a sad and depressing book. I gave it two stars because I didn't want to put the book down- I read it all the way through to see if there was to be any redemption in it. SPOILER HERE------Although there was ample foreshadowing about Jonah's 'sickness' and I wasn't surprised by his kidnapping the boy, this was anti-climatic and didn't add any depth to the plot. In the end, these characters were so pathetic, that reading the book was mostly a wasted day for me. How sad and without a purpose...these characters were boring, passive and without any redemptive value. Portraying loneliness is one thing, but this book is just sad and and depressing."
2,Depressing!,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews, but I found it to be depressing not hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't identify with or like any of the characters. It just seems totally unrealistic that so many bad things can happen to so many people who are unknowingly linked."
5,an exceptional piece of work,"I read a lot....not just novels, everything and anything I can get my hands on. I am one of those people who reads magazines, books, cereal boxes, junk mail, advertising flyers, the bathroom walls....but occasionally, just occasionally, something comes along that I know I am going to hate to finish reading. Chaon's novel was one of those occasions for me. I hated to leave these characters behind, and yes, I forged through at full throttle simply because I had to.Chaon's characters are real. Their lives are real, their dilemnas are real, and throughout there is this creeping sense of the duality of our own significant sense of self. I found myself reluctant to identify with any one of his characters, and yet, I was compelled to admit so many things about myself that I sigh before I can say....this novel, reminds me of me."
5,Amazing,I am a voracious reader and have to say that this is the best book of 2004. So well-written and I don't understand why it hasn't been nominated for book awards or in the NY Times' notables. Chaon's pen makes his everyday characters fascinating as they strive for some peace in life. PLEASE do yourself a favor and read this book.
3,Better as a Series of Short Stories,"I can't pour enough praise on Dan's ability to paint scenes and characters with his prose. Unfortunately, Dan's at his best when he sticks to his primary area of focus, the short story.Dan Chaon's attention to detail and memoir-like character accounts create a vivid patchwork of interconnected stories. The characters are poignant and haunting. Chaon manages to captivate right away, even though he loses a lot of steam in his attempts to weave things together. This was an enjoyable, if not disjointed read, but again, not the best prose to showcase Dan's abilities to craft fabulous stories."
4,May change your mind about reading short stories,"Maybe I'm one of the few people in ""contemporary reading"" who loves short stories. They used to be more popular in general society than they are today. Short story collections won big awards, like Pulitzers and National Book Awards. Short stories were the way to break into the market, published first in magazines and anthologies. Now, when we've tried to help a friend publish his collection of short stories -- excellent stories, I assure you, already published in Penna. Game News, Field & Stream, and the like -- most publishers are leary. So many said, ""Short stories just don't sell.""Those publishers should read this collection. Wow. I loved it. Lyrical writing, interesting characters. I'm actually looking forward to going back thru them a second time, to absorb more, to see them again from a new perspective."
2,very disappointed,"I'm reviewing this novel late; I read it a while back. But I am surprised at the majority of positive reader reviews. Like reading the prologue in Cunningham's The Hours, reading this novel's equisitely written first few pages was like having the icing before the cake and finding the cake itself bland and flat (and, well, so depressing, too, without being interesting, and dark without really terrifying, and the style itself throughout, irritatingly problematic).But there is a brilliance and depth of image in those first pages, and I hope that one day in another novel--or novella?-- this author--I think he's fairly young--will give whatever time it takes to sustain (for the most part) that same genius through to the end. I also loved the title."
2,Flat and disappointing,"I had high hopes for this novel. I have long been a fan of Chaon's short stories. But somehow his first novel is not in the same realm.The book starts off very well, but soon devolves into a series of flat, disjointed snippets from various stages of the characters' lives. Unlike other readers, I am not at all put off by what some call ""depressing"" circumstances in a novel. Yet as I continued to read Chaon's book, I came to realize that I just didn't care about his characters. That's what bothered me the most. And for me, it was a struggle to continue reading about characters I don't care about. Your mileage may vary."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book after reading the mostly phenomenal customer reviews, but I just didn't like it nearly as much as the rest of you seemed to. The writing is good; I will say that. I think my main problem was how much I disliked the character of Jonah. It may sound too simplified to say I'm an animal lover, but honestly, I was miserable from the (near) beginning following the Doberman episode, which I blame on Jonah even if he was a child. And the later episode with another dog really seals my feelings toward him. I couldn't stand that sad sac weirdo. Troy I liked more, and there were times I felt empathy for him. All in all, I was glad to finish it and start a new book."
2,Wrong Item?,Interesting. My experience with this item is the opposite of the previous reviewer.My light (with a replaceable battery) doesn't have a switch or toggle to keep it on when I need the light for more than a few moments. Having to keep squeezing the light to keep it on makes it only good for spotchecking - and then the ultrabright LED kills your night vision.Are there different versions of this item being shipped out randomly? Poor inventory control!
2,Not original,"The perfume is not original. It's half water half perfume. The first one I ordered is original. Moreover, I had to write to the seller before he shipped the product I don't know why."
5,My wife loves this!,I buy this perfume for my wife for her birthday every year. She would be mad at me if I didn't. It smells great on her. It's a great fragrance that I would recommend to everyone.
1,L'Air du Temps,"Sorry - You get one star and only because it was delivered in a timely fashion. I got a bottle of what is supposed to be L'Air du Temps which I have been wearing for forty years, but there isn't even any fragrance in the bottle. What a waste of money. I should have gone to Macy's."
4,LIke,"El paquete llego a tiempo su caja en perfecto estado todo de maravilla, el Aromo de la crema es esquisita. :)"
1,Dont waste your money,"This book is an expensive beginners guide to business operations. I expected more details on the how to write an operations manual, this is not what I found. Most of the topics covered are the same covered by the E-Myth series, a better written book for the money."
1,Does not fit MB 1984 300D,"This item does not fit a 1984 MB 300D, the bushings end is too wide to fit into the frame. Order the FEQ instead: W0133-1619325-FEQ (left front upper control arm)."
3,"Good book for this price, but....","This is a good book for aquarium biotopes beginners, worhthy the price, have lots of images, good ideas that may help you at the time you mount a tank. On the other hand, this book has many errors on the right location of some plants, for example anubias in an ""Amazon Acis Pool""?, i don?t think so, so if mistakes like this don?t bother you then this book is a good low price choice. Conversely to the plants mistakes, i found several ideas about ""fishing bitopes"", a very accurate research on fishes on differents areas. Good book for the price."
2,Moll Schmoll,"Moll Flanders is a noble, well-intentioned feminist parable set in the 18th century, and unlike most of the competition, it tries to take the high road. But that's a tall order when you realize it's actually based on Daniel Defoe's bawdy 1722 tome about the life and times of a woman forced to do all she can to escape poverty. As you can imagine, this includes things like selling her body, abandoning her numerous children, and stealing when necessary.Moll Flanders has a lot going for it: sumptous sets, earnest acting (if weak accents), and a heart set firmly in the right place. But the mistake made by screenwriter and director Pen Densham can only be described as a fear of flesh and blood. Moll is one-dimensional--caring, sweet, emotionally innocent. Her journey to self-reliance feels unearned, and is predictable and emotionally unsatisfying."
4,Surprisingly good,"I have never read the novel this is based on so my review is purely on the movie. I tuned in accidently to first watch this on TV and it caught my attention.The story being told to the girl was a great way to break up the story going back in time to Moll as she struggles to get out of the brothel and turns to drink. Since she turns to drink she is cheap to buy and thus great for the artist who needs a cheap model. Moll becomes his model and he falls for her and with time she also falls for him. But their happiness doesn't last long and Moll finds herself again faced with her past.Beautifully acted and the costumes and sets are devine. A story on the darker side of history.Recommended if you like a tale of adventure, love, betrayal and a mean-spirited villian :-)"
2,Not Really the One You Wanna See. . .,"This adaption of Moll Flanders is only close to the book because of the main character. Robin Wright stars as the famous prostitute whom is married once, not seen as a murderous as Hibble (Morgan Freeman) tells us she was, only stole a ring, wasn't put in prison and she was mostly a nice woman through out. Trust me, you'll want to purchase the Masterpiece Theatre one. It is way, way better."
4,"Read the book, but don't cast this movie aside!","I first read the *book* Moll Flanders when I was in eighth grade, and I loved it. Then I saw the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of the novel, and loved that. When I saw this title at the video store, I thought I'd give it a try.First off, as other reviewers have stated, it is nothing like the novel save the name of the main character and some of the ""adventures"" she has. HOWEVER, as a story it is not bad. Take a movie adaptation like ""The Scarlet Letter"" (with Demi Moore) or ""Queen of the Damned"" (with Aaliyah)--those are horrible adaptations of great books. This movie, however, is a good story in its own right, and not really an adaptation at all. The acting is good, the sets and costumes are pretty, and the plot, while not life changing, is moving and interesting.My advice: 1)Read the book. 2)Watch the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. 3)Watch this version, but keep an open mind and don't expect to see the same story that you read in the novel."
5,Forget the Title and Just Enjoy the Movie!!!!,"I knew nothing about this movie or the book that it's name is taken from when I watched it. I'm a big fan of both Morgan Freeman and Stockard Channing and that was all I needed to know. I found it charming and moving. Excellent casting and good performances by all characters. Having enjoyed the movie so much, I was anxious to read Defoe's novel of (basically) the same title. As a fan of classic literature, I enjoyed the book and could not see how the name had been lent to the movie. You cannot compare the two except for VERY MINOR similarities, so don't bother trying! I think this movie will be enjoyed by any fan of period films; any fan of the main stars; and any fan of a touching drama. If it didn't share the name of a great novel, it might have been well known as a great movie."
2,HOLLYWOOD vs. MASTERPIECE THEATRE,Don't waste your money on a bad replacement when you can see a MASTERPIECE.
1,"""Moll"" in name only...","this is one of the worst film adaptations of ""moll"" i've ever seen-- it's about as true to the novel as demi moore's ""scarlett letter"" was to that novel-- if you want the real spirit of moll, check out the bbc version w/alex kingston."
5,Beautiful!,"First off, I have to say that I don't care if the plot of the movie is the same as the book or not. I haven't actually read the book, but a movie is a movie, and this was a good one in a category by itself. I absolutely loved the relationship between Moll and the artist (does it actually ever say his name?), it was so sad and happy at the same time. Some of the lines of the movie are simply so romantic they could make you cry by themselves (such as when Moll says to her small-pox stricken husband ""If I could, I'd put my blood in you""). Coming from a girl who was raised on love stories by her mother- this is now one of my favorite ""watch it again and again"" movies!!"
5,"OK, OK, so it's not the book - buy it anyway","It is one of my all time favorite movies. All the actors are wonderful, sets and directing are equally good - all in all, much better than the junk Hollywood continues to dump on us lately.This will always be one of my favorites in my DvD collection. Definitely worth the purchaseIf you like period pieces, you will love this one. My husband loved it too."
5,Moll Flanders DVD,"I'm fully satisfied with the product. Shipping and delivery conditions were perfect, even faster than expected. The only thing I was a bit upset about were the subtitles. The DVD provided just French or Spanish subtitles. Since I teach English to Italian students and I use films a lot in my classes, (especially the ones taken from famous English and American novels) I find very useful to have subtitles in English. But this was maybe my fault: I should have looked at this in advance. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known but surely I would have missed a very good film. And students wouldn't have challenged a ""no subtitles"" experience."
5,A breakthrough book!,"My 4 year old son was severely speech impaired when he started bringing me ""The Book of Shadowboxes"" to read. Every day I would read it to him and he would point to the wonderful illustrations. After about 4 weeks, he began to say some of the words from the book. Every time we would read it together he would use a new word from the book. It was neat how he would point to the pictures and say the names of the items. For us, it was a miracle; for my son, it was just fun! Thank you Laura Seeley for this delightful book; it made such a huge difference in our son's life !"
5,770 Basic Phrases,"If your just learning Spanish or simply need to know the basics, this is a great start. I've referred to it quite a bit. I recommend it for beginners."
1,Easy Spanish,Easy Spanish is a great idea but the book is hopelessly outdated. Info about telegraphing et al is ridiculous. I wish there could be a more useful book.
4,A Super Aid,This little book has been a big help in using Spanish as I help and transport the sick and elderly. It has a high percentage of the expressions you will use (and need).
4,Excellent!!,"A very good ""quickie""-type language book. Helps you with common phrases. You won't learn much about conjugation here, but for the price, a very valuable addition to my library."
5,Better With Behind the Wheel Spanish,"There is no doubt that Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use is the cheapest and best bargain Spanish phrase book available.It is not, however, an 'all in one' learning tool. It is just a supplement to other materials, and a darned good one at that.As for the 'other materials' ... I would recommend you use Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use along with Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CDs and book. Fantastic combination. Many of the same phrases you read in 770 Basic Phrases are on the CDs so you get to actually hear them pronounced."
5,Best Purchase I ever made...,I am an instructor in Spanish and I gave everyone of my students this book. They loved it and found it to be helpful and informative. I think it was the best gift I could give to a beginning Spanish student.
4,Good book... great price!,This book is a very good value at its price.The topics are laid out very well.The book is very thin and lightweight.The printed format is a bit dated compared to other phrasebooks like Berlitz ..but the content is still very useful.
2,Underwhelming,"I bought this in a bundle offer. It's thin and fairly confusing. Also, I have a friend who speaks Spanish and she informed me half of the phrases are wrong. This book is pretty much useless. Move on."
5,Perfect Service,They give what they offer. I ordered a book and I got it the exact day they told me I would have it.
3,spanish phrases,"Not as great as I thought it would be, but there's some use to it. Many of the phrases are not typical ones everyone might use."
4,Great little book!,This is a great little book! I am traveling to Mexico for the first time and need to have some basic phrases for my trip. This book had the basic phrases and words that I will need while traveling. I didn't want to have to weed through a complete Spanish dictionary and this is just what I needed. :)
5,good stuff,great book so useful. this book has quotes that you would never think you need to know . but you do! its amazing
3,May be more useful for a trip to Spain,"The common phrases in this book aren't always the same as my other books and references. I think it is somewhat dated and is more for Spanish people in Spain, not Latin America. But it wasn't that much so I can't complain."
4,Neat Book,This is a great basic phrase book. They did a good job of setting up the pronunciations of the words.
5,Good primer before a trip,"Useful phrases with phonetic pronunciation, divided into catagories. Easy and quite practical. Quickly reviewable. Good value and nice to have on my Kindle."
3,Spanish Phrase Book,I guess I should have ordered a spanish/english dictionary.Don't have any more to say. v vvvv vvv vvvv vvvvv v
4,Good Little Phrase Book,"The Easy Spanish Phrase Book was helpful for learning key phrases to help one communicate with Spanish speaking persons. It was a bargain for what it was intended to do. It was not, however, a guide for general conversation or idententifing specific words and was limited to set phrases. For this purpose, it was set up well with categories listed in a simple format."
5,Easy Spanish Phrase Book,This book comes in handy when a quick phrase is needed and has easily understood pronunciations. I would recommend this book as a quick aid while learning Spanish or just to use as a daily referance.
2,strange and outdated,"This book was certainly cheap and it is certainly easy to carry. But it was also almost entirely useless. I know only a little Spanish, but enough that this book was not useful to me, because I already knew how to say anything in it that was meaningful to our travels. My husband, on the contrary, knows almost no Spanish. When attempting to shop on his own, he discovered that this book will tell you how to buy gold cufflinks, scarves, gloves, and almost every item of apparel except shirts and pants. It contains a very strange collection of phrases and does not appear to have been updated since its first publication in the 50s. Not useful if you want to ask the location of an internet cafe."
3,Buen Libro para un Turista,"Good book for a tourist in a foreign country. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my needs. I would recommend this book to anyone who is traveling abroad, but if you're looking for something that offers more general phrases in everyday situations, than this isn't a good choice. There wasn't much there that I might use at work while conversing with my Latino coworkers. I can't say it's a bad book; it just didn't fulfill my expectations."
3,Good resource book,"Book is obviously dated and had feeling that it provides mostly the formal way to speak spanish, but not the everyday normal usage."
3,Not what I expected,"If you are looking to learn any Spanish, this is not the book. Just quick ""Easy Spanish Phrases"", like it says."
2,You get what you pay for,"This book provides some helpful pronunciation tips and basic phrases (and some rather outdated-seeming phrases, too), but wasn't quite as useful as we'd hoped for. The biggest drawback was that the index only lists ENGLISH words...you're out of luck if you need to look up a Spanish word. But as cheap as it is, you can't complain too much!"
4,A good place to start,"If you're just starting to learn Spanish, this books is a good place to start for learning simple sentence structure, basic practical phrases and vocabulary. You will soon need much more material to build on but start with this simple book and low priced bargain and you'll be well on your way."
5,Love It but Don't Love It Alone,"I give this handy little book a whopping five stars. I love the size of Easy Spanish Phrase Book and its useful sentences.Very portable and loaded with common everyday phrases.Here's a tip.I am using my Easy Spanish Phrase Book with a CD course entitled Behind the Wheel Spanish. I just finished level 1 and 2 and will soon move on to level 3.It's amazing how important these phrases are and how they continually pop up in everyday conversation and how much more effective they are when you can hear themon the CD.Naturally, your choice for sentence formation is limited if you just stick to Easy Spanish Phrase Book. There's only so much you can fit into this tiny book.That's why I went with a full CD course and full text like Behind the Wheel Spanish.But when I am pressed for time and space, all I take along is Easy Spanish Phrase Book."
2,Only for beginners,"Everything in this book is what you would already know after a Spanish I class. Any new vocabulary words could easily be picked up elsewhere. As far as the phrases go, some of them could come across as rude if not used correctly. For example, the book often uses ""Quiero"" as ""I want"" when asking for something, when ""Quisiera = I would like"" would be more polite. ""Traigame una frazada = Bring me a blanket"" should be replaced with ""Me puede traer una frazada, por favor?"" Don't waste your time with this book unless you're an absolute beginner, and even then I would suggest something else."
3,Be careful...very thin book,While the book does what it says...it barely qualifies as a book...it's more like a pamphlet.
2,tiny and outdated,"Well, it's probably not the worst out there, but it's pretty short and leaves you wanting more. It's really not bad, but... It's just so-so."
1,Not what I expected!,"This book is extremely basic. It is for someone who has never learned any Spanish or for someone who has never been around Spanish speaking people...EVER! If you fall into that category than this book is for you! If not, try another book!"
3,we gave this to a friend in Ecuador,We didn't use this at all cause we found out that we could be in a foreign country and not speak their language.
2,not very useful,This isn't a super useful product if you already know a bit a spanish (and I consider my spanish pretty terrible). I wouldn't recommend it to anybody really. You're better of with a Spanish/English dictionary and the desire to learn.
4,GOOD PRASE BOOK,"VERY BASIC PHRASE BOOK. NOT THE BEST, BUT WILL BE HANDY IF NEEDED. THE PRICE IS PHENOMENAL: ONLY 2.00.WELL WORTH THE MONEY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,Not bad little pamplet,"I live in So Cal where, it seems, Spanish is spoken by every-other-person. (Not a slam! Just a fact!) My grandmother was from Guadalajara and we spoke Spanish when I was little, but all I remember is the names of things. This book is really good for basic phrases when you're travelling. If you're trying your Spanish out on a neighbor or friend, this gives you a place to start. There are no ""lessons"", per se, but it's laid out well and easy to carry with you. I would prefer it if this were the size of a paperback book, or smaller, so you could tuck it into your pocket and not look so much like a stupid tourists when you're using it."
3,easy spanish,A little dated but easy to use. Has all that's needed. I am using it every day. I would recommend this product.
1,Easy Spanish Phrases,Somewhat unhappy with the way Kindle handles the pages. Some of the words are too small to read despite using large print form the menu box.
4,Pretty good!,This has really helped me with shopping at the market. It also has many very common phrases that we use in daily living.
2,Old fashioned and out dated,"I bought this book when I was first learning Spanish and actually never touched it in my beginner stages. The book contains useful phrases that you'd need to know; however, they way they translate them into Spanish is almost overly proper and polite and if you were talking to any native Spanish speaker using these phrases, you would just seem awkward. I will say, though, that if your intention isn't to learn Spanish, but just to learn some phrases to get you by while traveling, this book might be ok...just expect some strange looks with some of the phrases."
4,Spanish Phrases,This book is compact and it is easy to find a lot of common Spanish phrases quickly and accurately.
3,This is helpful,"As someone who knows almost no Spanish, I thought this book was helpful. Though my husband, who is a pretty good Spanish speaker, said that some of the phrases in here too formal and aren't really used by people who speak Spanish as their first language."
1,Easy Spanish Phrase Book,"This books is not very practical..It lacks every day phrases that are necessary in normal conversation,very limited in my opinion.."
2,A little out dated,This is a very simple booklet that was made in the 1950's. It was designed for a tourist or business traveler going to Spain. It is a decent resource for that purpose but not practical for Latin American spanish today.
3,"How do you say ""rude"" in Spanish?","I bought this book based on the reviews I read here. While I agree that it's a bargain for $1.50, I have to say that I found some of the phrases to be presented as commands or demands, rather than polite requests. For example: ""bring me a . . . "" rather than ""may I please have a . . . "" I don't speak to people at home like that, and I certainly wouldn't as a visitor to another country.There is some good information in the book, though. If you buy this book, please choose your phrasing carefully."
4,A great tool if you need to travel without much time to prepare,"This is a great book for those learners who know little or no Spanish and need to travel in no time. Of course, on its own it is not so useful if you consider that not only do you have to pronounce the phrases but you also need to understand the answers that native speakers give you. However, at [...] I encourage my students who need to travel to buy it and we use the book to roleplay different travel situations. By working this way, you can profit much more than by just repeating phrases in isolation."
3,Slightly Outdated and Touristish,"This is a helpful book in many ways, however it is out of date. I wish I had checked when it was printed, so I would have known that many of the phrases that were commonly used then, are quite awkward now. However, much of the information remains useful. Also, I planned to use this book when working in a third world country, however it would be much more useful in a tourist's back pocket."
4,Helpful and brief,"This book is meant to cover some of the most common interactions you might have with a Spanish speaker, especially when traveling. It gives you both sides of the conversation, which is nice. Very basic book."
3,Good for the basics,"This book will get you through the rough spots. The only complaint is that it tells you the phrases that you can use, but doesn't have the phrases that you may encounter. What good is the answer if you don't know the question?Is pretty thorough for the price, and is small (thin) enough to carry around (although not in your pocket)"
3,Handy but dated,"This was quite a deal at $1.50, and did come in handy on our recent trip to Costa Rica. However, it was very ""urban"" oriented (we were in the jungle), and somewhat dated! For instance, there was a page devoted to sending telegrams, but nothing about cell phone reception or email access. However, it was clearly organized, small, and a good basic guide."
2,Misleading Title,"If I had been looking for a book of phrases for traveling this might have been helpful. As it was I was looking for everyday phrases (per the title) and this was not it. I don't ride trains and buses and taxis and check into hotels and make dinner reservations on a daily basis. Nor do I go through customs, take boat rides and buy cigars. This is a book for people who are away from home and need phrases for transportation, lodging, restrooms, etc.There is a bare minimum of hello, how are you, and words like who, what, why, but not much that I would ever use in my daily life. I'd like to be able to converse with spanish speaking customers, and the parents of my children's friends who speak spanish. In my mind that would be everyday use."
3,"""Every day use""","""Every day use"" is a bit of a stretch. I haven't had to ask for an ashtray or a telegram in a long time. Or ever. The book is pretty old, so these were probably appropriate at the time it was written. There are plenty of other useful phrases though. I like the way that it provides the phrase, the pronunciation, and the English translation very clearly. Many of the phrases might be useful, but not necessarily for a traveler.One more caveat if you are headed to Latin America like I was. This uses Castilian Spanish (spoke in Spain). People in Latin America speak a different flavor to the language, and there is a bit of a bias against those speaking Castilian."
4,very good basic reference,"Small enough to carry along, good value for the price. Lots of practical phrases, English to Spanish. Good pronunciation guides. I like the grouping by topic/situation. The main gap is the lack of any Spanish to English translation."
1,What a horrible book - worthless,"Zero Stars - This book may be ok for the absolute beginner, who knows nothing. I bought this book with Seymore Resnicks 1001 most useful Spanish Words, which is one of the best reference books I have seen. I still use it every day and it's counterpart 1001 English Palabras, one year later.If you know the days of the week and numbers, this book is probably too basic for you. I read the entire book in about an hour, learned very little, and haven't opened it since. And I was not at all skilled in Spanish at the time.Dont buy this book, but definitely buy 1001 Most useful Spanish Words!"
1,Not Very Useful,"As someone with basic spanish language skills which allows me to get most of what I need in Mexico, I bought this book to use as quick reference. It's not very good. First, it's too large for your pocket. Second, it doesn't lend itself to easy and fast reference. Third, it is not geared towards ""Mexican"" spanish. I would recommend the ""Lonely Planet Guide to Mexican Spanish"" instead."
4,Great Refresher!,"I bought this as a refresher course for a recent trip we made to Cancun. I took Spanish in high school but needed some reminding. It was a little smaller than I expected, but gave a lot of useful phrases. As other reviewers have stated the phrases are a little on the old-fashioned side. But the sections on Food (ordering, etc.) and medical (hospital, pharmacy etc.) were very all inclusive. A great guide."
3,So-so,I've been reading and studing Spanish for a while now. Useful phrases. Some of them forgot to put the pronunciations under some of the kinda important sentences. It's not a real thick book.
5,best 2 bucks ever spent,"You will not be disappointed. It may be simplistic to people with existing Spanish skills, but for the average American traveling to Latin America with very little Spanish this book will make a world of difference. I wanted this book to brush up on basic small talk and food ordering. Much more than I expected. Even if you think you are hopeless when it comes to foreign languages, give it a shot. Hotel and restaurant staff appreciate it and treat you better when you bother to learn how to say hello to them."
5,Very handy for traveling,"I found this book to be a very good traveling companion. It shows the phonetic pronunciation of the Spanish phrases. In combination with an English-Spanish dictionary, I can create almost any Spanish phrase I need. It's a little too big to fit in a pocket, but the size allows for a type big enough to be read easily."
3,"ok, good basic book for tourists/beginners","got it for my neice, she used it some but it was kind of stilted/formal espanol. still it helped her out esp at the beginning of her stint in Spanish-speaking world.very fast shipping and item as described. thank you!!"
4,Is it what is it,"I was a bit disappointed with it, the numbers puzzled me a bit before I understood them. I didn't like how it was organized."
3,Phrase book,"I'm only putting on here that I just like the phrase book because I don't really have a lot of experience with it, but from what I did read it's accurate"
3,Easy Spanish Phrase book,the terms in book are very dated. Such as sending a telegram. Nothing about cell service or internet access.It is small but easy to carry around. Worth price.
1,Re-wrapped Ripper,"I followed an online recommendation to this book. As a lover of Alan Moore's From Hell (a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper) and a lover of London's dark side, it caught my interest. But for me the writing was ultimately more turgid than dense, more aligned with the author's inner thoughts than the character's - and somewhat too clever to easily digest. (For example - and this is from memory since I don't still have my copy - if you can work out the exact meaning of ""He knew he would finally act when his hands were firmly in his pockets"", then you might enjoy this book more easily than me. Otherwise I can't recommend it.)"
5,cool,this thing is awsome. the snow speeder transport thing is tight but it is hard to build except that's probobly 'cause I'm 8.
4,Garfield fan=one of his best,I got this for my Dad - he really liked John Garfield - I saw this also and it is one of his best.
3,OK but lacks depth,"I bought this videotape because I like boxing and heard this movie was one of the best boxing movies ever made along with ""Raging Bull"". The movie was pretty good but lacks the artistic depth of ""Raging Bull"". In fact, the movie really isn't even about boxing but is a straight morality play. The boxing is incidential. In the movie, the characters are either good or bad, with little grey, except for the Garfield character. Of course, good triumphs and the hero gets the girl. This makes the film a little boring on both an intellectual and emotional level. Anyone more interested in boxing, and being challenged intellectually and emotionally, is better off with ""Raging Bull""."
1,Weak.,"The bung itself was stainless steel, but the plug was neither stainless or inverted hex as pictured- instead it was just a regular hex head."
3,Item not as pictured,"Have purchased 3 of these now - and none have matched the picture advertisement. I chose these to weld into stainless motorcycle headers and liked the clean look of the round socket head plug. The ports are only used for tuning, and the bike sports the plugs most of the time. UNFORTUNATELY all three have arrived with unsightly hex head plugs instead of the socket head plug pictured. Worse yet, in use the ""stainless steel"" plugs rusted immediately, and the machine work on same is of poor quality. The bung itself is fine, welded easily, and has been adequately corrosion resistant."
3,Item not as shown,I purchased two of the items with the intention of welding onto my Buell header pipes. These will be on show which is why I wanted the items in the picture. What was delivered was not what was in the picture but a bung with a hex head. This is unsightly in comparison to the allen key style as shown. The maching quality of the hex head could be better.
5,Great T-Shirt,"I wear this T-Shirt as an undershirt and it's excellent. The fabric is smooth and soft and it holds its shape extremely well. It's a really well made shirt for the price that it is being sold for. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a few, because this T-Shirt really is a staple in any wardrobe, especially if you wear it as an undershirt."
1,Junk,"This item does not fit correctly on my Romanian made AK-47 it's to short and wobbles back and forth! And whats with the set screws that protrude 1/4 on an inch out of the back half of your receiver! This item is pure junk, you should just have your receiver drilled for the side scope mount and save yourself the grief of wasting money on this product."
2,Not for a real AK 47,"Maybe an airsoft AK or a rimfire AK like a .22 but any kind of actual recoil will loosen this rather quickly.I was happy to have remembered to take the original cover when I went to the firing range today.If you think this is the answer to your needs to put a scope on your 7.62 FORGET IT! If you still want to get this thing try this first; get 20.00 from the ATM, go into the restroom and put the 20.00 in the toilet and flush. Now go get a side mount as intended in the first place."
2,Fitting is required..........,"I received this a few months ago and still havent even attempted to put it on cause of the fitting im gonna have to do. Product seems to be of good quality, but horrible quality control. I havent returned it cause I would like to make it work. But I was really hopeing it would go right on like the one thats on it. OH WELL!!"
2,Probably not worth buying.,"This seems like a good idea. An easy to install scope mount for an AK. It is fairly well made for the price and has allen head bolts to help secure it. The problem is that it is 'universal' and doesn't fit very well. At least not a Chinese MAK. It took a fair amount of time with a Dremel tool to make it half-way work, but it still wasn't secure. The problem is that the receiver cover is just not a good mount for a scope. I doubt that you could ever keep it zeroed. It might be okay with a cheap red dot where close enough is acceptable, but for anything else, buy a receiver mount or use the iron sights."
4,Great cover! minimal grinding for Wasr10 Ak47,"Hey i saw some of the other reviews on the this ak cover and was sceptical in buying it but i did and turned out better then i expected. I have a Wasr 10 Ak47 and all i had to do was hammer the back lip of the cover under the square hole a little bit so it falls in place, i also had to grind a little portion of the square hole on the bottom where the square button pops out, i did this took about 10 min all together and it went right on. Great Ak top cover!"
4,"Works well, but I kinda like it better without",It seems to work quite well on my inter ordinance AK-47 with very minor filing on the hole on the back. Doesn't wobble at all.
3,Good Concept,I do like the build quality of this but the fitment can be an issue. It is a well built piece from what I can tell. I only use it for holding a flashlight so movement is not an issue but there is no way this would ever work for any type of optic. For the price it's cool to have an extra dust cover though!
3,rail is great mount doesn't fit my gun...,"the rail is great but receiver doesn't fit my gun. about 3/8 inch to small, but you can make anything work."
2,Waste of money,"Even with the rear screws adjusted properly, and lock-tite used, they cover wobbles. I tried to shim the front where the wobbling was worst with copper adhesive strips and it was better, but still unacceptable. Would rate it 1 star but it was 17.00 and my expectations weren't high to begin with."
4,Sucked at first!!!,"Length wise, fits a 94 MAk 90 like a glove... Very sloppy on the sides, would rock left or right several millimeters!!!With a plastic mallet, was able to snug up the fit! Don't need the silly Allen screws now to keep it square! They did ad material behind the holes for some added threads as some have suggested, not perfect... May need to trim it back with Dremo Tool? Happy? Heck ya!!!"
2,No where close to fitting,This product was no where close to fitting my wasr and insted of trying to file and risk damageing it or my rifle I sent it back for a refund and got the side rail mount which I am happy with.
1,Disappointing,"What should have been a quick and easy install became anything but. Tried to install on two AK's with no luck. Fit was poor, seemed like the cover would not fit down on the receiver correctly.I've used these receiver covers many times with no fitment problems whatsoever, very surprised since I have had great experiences with NC Star products. Would not recommend this item."
1,Hon28,Awful product you have to do some mods to it and even after that it does not fit the weapon it becomes loose every single time the weapon is shot. Do not recommend it.
4,Requires a little fitting,"I bought it as a no-risk proposition since I have two AK's and I assumed it would fit at least one. It did, it fit my Bulgarian AK(milled receiver)with just a little filing to the top of the square hole that holds the recoil spring assembly. Two screws kept it tight and held steady during shooting. Also kept the zero (like 1/2 min adjustment needed) after taking the cover out for cleaning and resetting.Did not fit AT ALL my Romanian stamped receiver, it felt like it was maybe 50 mils too long for it and would require a lot of filing.The problem is not this cover, is the loose standards between the many AK factories. By requiring some fitting it insures tightness. It looks nice, with matte color that matches more AKs and the rails are very straight and aligned. Quality feels great for the price. Also easier to remove for 922r peace of mind.Planning to buy another one and try harder with my Romanian. Definitively not for you if you are not willing to tinker a little with it."
1,bad choice,"I give one star for the fact it exists. Doesn't fit worth a ^#%^. Order a dogleg receiver cover for about $130, far more worth it."
5,Very Pleased,"I'll have to say that I was really impressed with what a quality rail set up this is. It went on with no fitting on my part. Locks up real tight and even has a two slot rail, on the right and left sides, that can be easily removed. Well worth it, even at twice the price."
1,Pass on this item.,"I bought this thinking it would be an easy-to-install mounting system. However, it has two serious problems. Firstly, it didn't fit without modifications made by filing and bending (it should have fit on my Egyptian Maadi as they are identical to Russian models). But the worst thing about this is that the receiver cover isn't a solid mounting area. It moves slightly and even the slightest movement will completely ruin your sights' zero. I can't trust a system that doesn't hold zero. What I eventually went with was having a gunsmith install a side plate then getting a detachable slide mount to put on that; and it works perfectly. Anyone concerned about accuracy will stay away from this item, and that should be everyone."
3,Solid material but requires fitting,"I just purchased this AK Receiver rail mount for my Draco AK-47 pistol. I would rate the quality of the product a 5 star for sure. The material is very solid, well made. As far as the fitting, it requires a little modification. It is about a tiny bit mm too long. The manual did say that it would require a little bit of filing or cutting to fit your AK-47. Once I did a little bit of filing, it finally fit. The two allen screws do secure the rear part of the receiver very tight, but the end part of the receiver next to the rear sight do wobble a little bit. So, I gave the overall rating a 3 star. But for the price, you have nothing to lose."
4,ak receiver cover tri rail,good product works great but requirs some filing in the front end and on the mount screws on the in side for it to fit well on my romanian ak 47
2,didnt fit my romanian wasr 10,I had to do a lot of filing to make this dust cover fit my everyday stamped WASR 10. more trouble then it was worth in my opinion
4,COTTON PICKIN' GOOD,"Best picture Oscar for 1967, with Steiger also winning for best actor.Film itself is erratically paced and quite convoluted, especially in the final 7-10 minutes. The major theme,obviously, is Poitier's presence as an intellectually superior black police officer from Philadelphia, Pa. and his gradual acceptance by Steiger.Steiger arrests Poitier twice, before solicitinng his advice on a murder case involving a progressive businessman.Caution: the movie is based on a novel. Steiger finally thinks he has the proper suspect in custody, and wants Poitier to ""vamoose"", lest the sheriff be labeled a ""nigger lover"". But Poitier's own independent investigation proves otherwise in a fast paced conclusion that this reviewer has already warned the viewer about. One would like to think that attitudes have moderated over 40 years, but skin pigment and religious disputes continue to plague civilization. For what good cause?"
4,"A mystery, a drama, and a social commentary in one.","""In the Heat of the Night"" is an excellent mystery story. It is also a wonderful drama about two very different men. It is also a fascinating character study of those two men. And it is also a commentary about racist views in the south. All of this rolled into one film makes ""In the Heat of the Night"" a true classic. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. The acting by Sidney Poiteir, Rod Steiger, and Warren Oates is superb. The ending is very satisfying, especially the final scene when Chief Gillespie finally sees Virgil Tibbs as a man instead of as a black man. Four and a half stars...."
5,Watch a legend perform,"When I was a young girl, I watched them filming a scene in this movie in the small town of Sparta, IL. I had no idea at the time I was watching a legend perform. Sidney Poitier is unsurpassed in his ability to bring a character to life that reaches beyond age, race or gender. He will always be one of my favorite actors. This movie, as well as many others are in my library, and I never tire of watching him as a detective, teacher, carpenter, friend. This particular movie offers the added gift of bringing prejudices into the light and exposing them for the foolishness they are. It is also a great movie!"
2,Bad disc,In the Heat of the Night is a bad disc.I can't display it. I think the regiocode is not good.Please send a new one. This is the first time I can't display a purchase by you.I am waiting for the confirmation you sent me a new one.Regards.Jos Sluis
1,in the heat of the night,"Unfortunately--I Am unable to view this product because of some mal-function of the TAPE.Each time I'VE INSERTED IT INTO my 2 different vcr's plus my neighbors and finally a relative's --IT SELF-EJECTS!please advise.In an attempt to locate the seller:scottsaucs@sbcglobal.net I'VE RECEIVED PERSON UNKNOWN RESPONSE.We really want this vhs tape but are reluctant to pay for it again via Amazon.com.please advise and how may I return this one?Sincerest Thanks,don greathousep.s very satisfied w/all other transactions"
1,DAMAGED VIDEO,FOR THE FIRST TIME I RECEIVED A VIDEO FROM AMAZON THAT WAS SO SEVERELY DAMAGED THAT I WAS UNABLE TO VIEW IT!
5,:),"THANK THANK UUUUUUUUUU wonderful movie hubby loved it and i do too, postive rates and came on time I was soo happy"
3,in the heat of blinking,I saw this movie last week and decided to get it. I like the movie alot. The movie rec'd ok quickly from subvendor at amazon great. Like others might have said here. The movie blinks during playback at certain times. Overall the picture and sound were great just hopes it last awhile. I give it 3 stars for the blinking but picture and sound ok does not blink all the time. It could be how the picture was put on the dvd process. Transfer could have been better.Put up with the slight blinking for a few minutes since this is again a great movie and story with very good acting.I cannot wait for it to come out on bluray. I HOPE it does come out on bluray since it is too good of a movie not to happen. This is a great movie and more people should go back and watch it. I belive it is alot better than some of the junk that is on movie screens now where we pay $12 to look at.
5,THE BEST OF ALL HIS FLICKS,I LOVED THIS MOVIE ... SIDNEY IS AT HIS BEST PLAYING A BIT ROUGH FOR HIS USUAL ROMANTIC AND QUIET DEMENOUR.
4,In The Heat of The Night,Outstanding actors. I liked that both the white cop & the black cop were bigots. A good portrait of changing times
5,Joint Factors 500 + 400 mg / 120 caps,My order was shipped and delivered in record time. They have greatly helped my joints. I have more flexability!
4,Spirtual and Scholarly,"I found this book to be very enjoyable and satisfying spirituallyat a crucial time. The Bible; a Literary Study is appropriatefor use as a textbook, for personal study, and as a source of lessons or sermons. Believers and academics of every level willappreciate this book. I found the section on Job to be among thebest in the book."
3,"Nice brass selection except for ""Eonta""","Overall, a diverse and well-performed selection. I recommend almost all the pieces, and am particularly fond of the Ruggles. But if you're a hard-core modern music enthusiast, don't get this disc for the Xenakis - the performance of Eonta is strangely flabby and punchless, kind of a ""Xenakis Lite"" (I've heard an excellent live performance, which was nothing like this recording). If not for the substandard Eonta, I'd have given the disc four stars."
3,Revolutionary thinking,"As early as the 1960s, Africa was posited as the original site of human culture--some 130,000 years ago. Considered revolutionary and dangerous at the time, this theory has now been substantiated by increasingly solid archeological evidence. Building on the foundation of that theory, Lucia Chiavola Birnbaum postulates that if blacks were the original people, it follows that any original divinity must also have been black. Then, with an abundance of new research and evidence, Birnbaum demonstrates that that deity was female. Dark Mother offers another revolutionary and dangerous theory, a convincing reason for delving into its amalgam of solid scholarship, family history, feminist tract, and New Age sensibility."
5,Great writing,"Tom Phelan makes those terrible times come to life in a very special way with this novel. The characters are engaging, the story first rate. He clearly has done his homework, and this is a very moving book. It is one of the saddest things I've ever read."
1,"Only included the clamps, no crossbars!","Looks like a good product but, for some reason, this is only for the clamps. No crossbars are included. I returned product."
4,Smokin' hot!,"Isabel Adjani may be playing a character with a loose screw. But I am telling you, the babe is smokin' hot!"
3,A Headache of an Ending,"This author has a truly intellectual, engaging style that sucked me in on about the 8th page, so well that I HAD to find out what happened and quickly! When I did, I felt a smack and then, a thud. I didn't care for the ending or its crafting."
1,Huge Disappointment.,"As a big time, long term Trevanian fan, I was extremely disappointed in this ""experiment"" by the author. I deem this effort an experiment since it is so unlike anything ""Trev"" (as his fans call him) has ever written before. Plain flat-out boring! It's almost as if Jane Austen had attempted to write a Twilight Zone episode under the influence of Sominex."
3,"Gripping, but doesn't deliver","When Trevanian passed away last December, I was intrigued by the descriptions of his thrillers in the obituaries, and decided to try them out. Though I haven't yet read his most famous book, Shibumi, I've now completed Incident at Twenty-Mile and The Summer of Katya.I found both books gripping. Trevanian likes to play with pacing, point-of-view, and plot twists in such a way as to draw you relentlessly on, even as you're aware on some level that you're being had.At the same time, neither book delivers in the end on the suspense that has been so well crafted. Instead, the plots in both novels are resolved by eruptions of violence that arise randomly, rather than organically from the story and characters. And I was surprised to find that both books relied on the hoary device of an amnesiac killer."
4,Requires some background,"Alas, the background needed is an out of print book by Lucy Freeman, The Story of Anna O., the woman who led Freud to psychoanalysis. Katya is a lot more vibrant than Bertha Pappenheim (Anna O.) was, a good deal more violent as well.The book is a great takeoff on that style of case history, though perhaps unintentionally. Made for great reading, but then I'm a Trevanian junkie."
4,"excellent alloy, nice body, good finish","A solid choice, excellent depth, smooth finish. Hints of Manganese and Copper. I'd give it 98 points of Aluminum. Fully aged, ready to go today!"
4,An excellent collection of Bloom's lesser known essays,"I must admit that I am not usually a fan of posthumous essay collections, but this book had some truly wonderful nuggets of wisdom and insight, as well as a great introduction about the man himself (which was my real exposure to Bloom as a man... well, before Ravelstein anyway). I studied under one of Bloom's students at the University of Maine and feel that this was one of the most important influences on my life as a scholar. A truly wonderful read and some very interesting essays about diverse materials."
4,Watergate's Twin Towers,"""The Palace Guard"" is the story of the two most powerful underlings in the Nixon Administration, H.R. ""Bob"" Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Together, they rose to the pinacle of success by shielding their paranoid boss from all those with whom he did not wish to associate. And together they fell, both resigning on the last day of April 1973 as the heat from the Watergate scandal began to scorch the second term President who had been reelected by a landslide only months before. Rather and Gates's account, while lacking historical perspective, is fascinating in how it depicts two power hungry men who moved largely in the shadows. They served their boss well, even to the end when it was hoped that by their sacrifice he would be saved. Political junkies will love their story."
5,Hmmm you didn't sprinkle coffee on the pages did you?,"This was such an amazing book that I read it all in one sitting. It was addictive....or could that just be because it was all about coffee? Whatever the reason, Sandra Posey has written a wonderful book, complete with the history of coffee and it's myths to the more modern coffee delights...chocolate covered coffee beans anyone? I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in coffee or divination. Hmmm...now where did I put that coffee pot....."
2,Okay,"This book was okay if you are looking for a wide range if information. But if you are looking for specifics on reading coffee grounds, this, for me, was not helpful at all. Sorry."
3,"Tea is Great, Price is Bitter","I love Earl Grey tea and have recently discovered the great TAZO blend. It's probably one of the best ""brands"" around. But you have to be kidding on the price!! I can take a 5 minute walk to my neighborhood Starbucks where one box (of 24 bags) costs around $4.50. Multiply that by this 6 box bundle and you get $27.00. So what am I paying the extra 2 bucks for, not the dispenser--which is just a cardboard-like box the tea comes! You've got to be kidding me. I thought things were supposed to be cheaper in bulk. C'mon Amazon! You can do better."
3,watson,"This book was a little hard to get through, but of course Watson was a founding father for so much psychology."
4,Good Armchair Primer,"Laminated, with a Glossary, a color Court Diagram, Position breakdown...It won't break down plays BUT it will give you a rudimentary understanding and is great if you want to explain a basic concept to a young child without muddling things up.Due to the lamination and compact size you can definitely bring this little deal to a High School, College or Pro game.Decently priced too."
1,"Unreadable...yes, that bad.","I can't even finish this book.I also really want to like the novel, but the poor quality of the writing, the unrealistic dialogue, and the inaccurate and gratuitous references to punk images (if protagonist Melany makes ONE MORE REFERENCE to the fact that she has blue hair, I'm going to scream) makes this too frustrating--and boring--to get all the way through. As a punk dyke in my twenties, I feel obligated to say that this is NOT what the scene was or is all about--at least not in the first few chapters.Read Bett Williams' GIRL WALKING BACKWARDS instead. It's lot more realistic and on-target, in my humble opinion."
4,a really cute book,"OK, so it's not intense reading, but this book was so cute- perfect rainy day reading!"
2,Another open mind shoved in a blender,"I really wanted to like this book, really. Never mind the pointless band references and the gratutious lesbian sex, the worst part of this book was thinking someone might actually think this is what punk was about! Not a reference book, and not a real good fiction novel either."
3,punkerdykes will appreciate this one,"This one actually deserves 3.5 stars, but the rating system likes even numbers. I enjoyed this novel about a punk rock girl coming to grips w/ her lesbian identity. It's a good quick read w/ a slamming soundtrack consisting of bands like the Clash, the Pretenders, and X-Ray Spex. On the downside, at times Sprecher seems to try too hard to make the story accessible to non-punks, and I think this sometimes hurts the book more than helps it. True punk rock attitude wouldn't care if you don't get all the references, so why does Sprecher? The love story angles are a little better than the political notes that sometimes get a bit tedious, and it has a sweet, if predictable, resolution. I think people in general can relate to the twisted need to give a relationship that just won't die a second chance. Get out your vinyl punk records, spike up your hair, shut yourself in your room w/ the lights low, and spend the afternoon reading this book."
4,You Cannot Be Serious,"A good read, even for a non-tennis person. He does tend to overly name names, but if you're into tennis the names are all familiar, if you're not...you can skim over them easily. He goes through his career and ends with his lovelife. Interesting."
2,"GREAT PICTURES OF MAC WITH REAGAN, BUSH, AND CLINTON!","YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS has some great pictures of John McEnroe with Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton, and some interesting stories about Jimmy Connors and Vitas Gueralitas.Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"
3,YouCanNotBeMoreBIGHEADED,"If your a Die hard Tennis fan,your going to LOVE this Book.McEnroe goes into every game he's played since he was 5,every Point,everyPain,and you will be in pain also for the most part.Every time we get to an interesting part,John skips over the event.(Like the famous star he dated who was alot older than him with 2kids.Cher,CarlySimon?The thing he took at a party were he had to be carried out. Was it Advil? ) I also can't understand why Tatum is upset with the book.I guess she's still in love with him.John doesn't go into details about her problems.I also hate the fact that McEnroe does not believe in God.I guess when your handed this great talent,fame and money at a young age,you think your GOD.I also can't believe John thought he was going to become a HUGE rock star.YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!!To be honest,I did enjoy some parts of the book,but my hero,Jimmy Connors,is shot down,and made to be the bad guy in Johns version.I would love to hear Jimmys side."
4,"A fascinating read, pure Johnny Mac.","This is the true tale of John McEnroe, the baddest boy that tennis has ever seen. I enjoyed reading his story, especially his take on various foes like Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, and Bjorn Borg. The writing is crisp, but not to the level of some memoirs I've read. Overall, a satisfying read that reveals more than I expected.If you are looking for the ultimate tennis tell-all, I highly recommend Andre Agassi'sOpen: An Autobiography (Vintage). This one is a doozy, and one of the best memoirs I've read in a long time. I loved this one. Very highly recommended!"
4,Very entertaining - Worth every penny!,"Johnny Mac is a very interesting guy. Having grown up watching his epic matches with Borg and Connors I was eager to read this book. It did not disappoint. You will be happy to find all the details on his tennis career and all of the behind-the-scenes action that the media never covers.But even more impressive was to read about John's growth from a self-centered kid into a mature father. As one who has made the same journey, this part really touched me.The only thing missing was more dirt on his ex-wife's abuse of narcotics and their custody battle, as well as details on the abuse dished out by his ex-father law. But I guess you have to respect a guy who doesn't trash people just to sell a few more books.Well worth the (used book) price!"
3,You cannot be serious,"As a lifelong fan of tennis I was looking forward to this book very much. While it was interesting to hear Mr. McEnroe's story in his own words, I felt like he was VERY selective with regard to what he chose to discuss. He was so brutally honest about all matters tennis and yet offered very little about his personal life. His marriage to Tatum O'Neal was barely even mentioned, which is surprising considering that they had 3 children together. I believe that if you are going to write an autobiography you must be willing to tell the good, the bad and the ugly. In my opinion, Mr. McEnroe told only bits and pieces and left his readers wondering about everything in between."
2,Disappointing & Dull!,"As a long time fan of professional tennis, and John McEnroe in particular, I was tremendously disappointed in this one. Most of the book reads like a box score of a tennis match. McEnroe describes matches in agonizing detail. I was amazed that he remembered these matches so explicitly; perhaps he watched video of them while writing the book. There is painfully little about his personal life. I read Tatum O'Neal's book just before this one, and was curious to read McEnroe's take on their marriage. While I admired him for not taking an opportunity to trash his ex, he doesn't disclose much about why their marriage failed, or why his current marriage succeeds. I suppose he wanted to keep some things private, which is certainly understandable; but if that's the case, why write an autobiography in the first place?"
4,Worth buying for the first half,"I really enjoyed this book. The first half focuses on JMacs tennis career and matches and he gives a lot of insight into his key matches and opponents. He definitely gets rather technical here but I find it interesting to read his analysis of Arthur Ashe's backhand, for example. He doesn't shrink away from doing a set by set analysis of his key matches, but again I find it interesting to read a first hand account of a wimbledon final in intricate detail from the perspective of one of the participants... The second half focuses more on his personal life, which was less interesting to me. Mcenroe is remarkably straightforward about his shortcomings on and off the court, which makes this more honest and less self-aggrandizing than most autobiographies. For anyone interested in the game of tennis and the career and opinions of one of the game's greatest players, this is definitely worth picking up."
3,"Good on tennis, bad on personal insight","The book offered great tennis history. It makes me want to rewatch all those great matches. Perhaps a video/dvd collection, John?I was disappointed in the lack of insight he brought to his personal and emotional life. As other reviewers have written, he did not offer much beyond what a magazine article written by another author would provide. He seems incapable of being diplomatic with those he has chosen to dislike. He constantly offered excuses, rather than understanding, for his own mistakes. It's apparent he is afraid of failure and is perhaps reluctanat to analyze his own faults for fear he (and we) won't forgive him(self) for them. You've got to be willing to put yourself out there when writing a biography. Seems to me that Mr. McEnroe needed a few more years to develop some emotional maturity and emotional intelligence before writing this one."
3,Better Than Average,"Better than most autobiographies. Moments of honesty and openess...however, not enough. McEnroe is too fascinating a character for such a tepid book like this.I did not get to see him during his best tennis years, so I did find the parts that recounted past matches to be pretty engaging.This is a good shot. If you're a Mac fan, buy it. If not, go get it from the library. It's worth the read."
5,I couldn't put it down,"In retrospect, John McEnroe was the only reason I watched tennis on TV. He's a genius and tennis hasn't been the same since...So I just had to read this book and I absolutely loved it. I understand the people who were hoping he would reveal more - but after having read this I do believe he is essentially a shy person who isn't able to expose every bit of himself. And I don't agree that he was overly critical of Tatum - from what I read, I believe he was making every effort to stick to the facts.I hope we see more of him on TV and in print.If you enjoy tennis-Read This Book!"
4,"Loved it, brings back some great memories","Tennis at it's peak....Great book, Now I remember all those incidents....Being a huge tennis fan, I found this fun to read and it actually motivated me to play better...."
4,A surprisingly affective read,"Better than I expected...McEnroe discusses his life on and off the tennis courts with a surprising candidness that is always engaging. His memoir is entertaining, somewhat insightful, and a must-read for anyone who enjoys the sport of tennis, admires McEnroe's skill both as a player and most recently as a commentator, or wants an inside peek of what went on in those halcyon days of the '70s and '80s when tennis was really at its peak."
2,Only for the most dedicated tennis fans,"I found this book to be a little dull. The bulk of it is just a chronological listing of his matches, with a little insight from John about the match. He does talk a little bit about his antics, his marriages, and other non-match related stuff, but not enough for me. If you loved Johnny Mac back in the 80's I guess you would like this, but for the rest of us, I would pass on this book."
4,"works very well, but dents lids","This is simply the best jar opener I've used, because it grips easily, and doesn't slip.I'm not sure why they market it so narrowly to those with arthritis. Anyone would prefer it to the other jar openers I've tried.The only drawback is that it does make a dent in the edge of the lid proportional to the force that was necessary to turn the lid. The dent doesn't prevent re-using the lid, but I wouldn't use the Un-Skru on any lid that needed to be preserved ""for show"" for some reason. (In the latter case, I'd use some kind of strap wrench, e.g.SEEN ON TV Grip Wrench Pro, though that would be much less convenient, and prone to slipping.)"
4,Tells it like it is,"I couldn't put it down -- extremely honest account (at least I had no trouble imagining that I'd feel the same way in similar circumstances, supposing I survived them)."
2,Not what I expected,"I am a mom of three children with galactosemia. I bought this book because I know how Marilu Henner deplores milk and milk products. Although most of the book deals with how to get your kids healty I bought it for the recipes for my preschoolers. Many of the recipes calls for soy cheese or soy yogurt. Almost every varity of these ""non dairy"" soy products are made from caseinate. This IS a form of dairy. The recipes given aren't anything new. They are recipes you can find in your cookbooks already on your shelf. She just removes the meat and dairy products and substitutes them for soy. If you are wanting info on how to get your kids healthy buy the book. If you are wanting new ideas on what to feed your kids look elswhere. I already knew carrot sticks and celery were better for my kids than pop tarts. I didn't need to spend $20 to read it."
4,Need a little more..,"The books is useful and would help many people (including myself). If was an author, I would have added detail chapters on Java Beans, Applets, testing of RMI. I like the chapter on J2ME!"
3,It's an older book,"There are quite a few newer books on TMJ that have good reviews. This is an older book, and when it came out, it was one of the few sources of information. It was decent for its time, but now there are better. The positive reviews about this book are older."
1,Horrible BOOK! Do Not buy,"Do not buy this book, it is basically just a depressive book. By Dr. Uppgaard's book instead, this dentist is a pessimistic dentist so stay away from this book and his ""knowledge""."
2,Don't buy Pimsleur Russian-Express,"I can recommend the Pimsleur/Simon & Schuster Audio/4 audiocassette language course, which I also bought, but not this one. Lesson one of these two courses are virtually the same (learning how to say, in Russian, ""Excuse me. Do you speak English? Russian? I don't understand Russian""), but this Russian Pimsleur Express CD then goes on to other lessons where the individual words aren't translated word-for-word, leaving a beginner without a clue."
2,Not what I expected,Thought that there may be a bit more detail. Dont buy this product if you expect to learn to speak Russian before going there on holiday
5,Great!,I have never seen a better reason to buy a directors cut. The movie is a lot more seamless. Anyone who liked the original will be glad to see more of background to Riggs and Murtough.
5,Mel and Danny are my heroes!!!!!,"One of Mel's best, I think the chemistry between Riggs and Rodger are great.They are both really good actors and were really good in these 4 movies.I LOOOVE IT!!"
3,A Great Movie But The Sound Is OFF!,"I really enjoyed seeing the additional footage on DVD and the picture quailty was GREAT, but what really was missing was the great sound of DTS. I've heard other moives in DTS and they would blow you away, but this moive leaves you flat. There is no surround sound rear speaker involvment to mention. I was disappointed with this aspect of the DVD."
2,OK film not great transfer to Blu-Ray,For one thing the menu on mine doesn't work and I cannot change the audio track or the subtitles. It's a default that doesn't sit well with this reviewer. The movie itself truly doesn't stand the test of time because it seems like pure drivel now and is not very relevant.
1,If You Love Lethal Weapon--DON'T BUY THIS DISC!,"I had gotten this disc in the four-pack that also includes Road Warrior and Swordfish. First off, it's not even in the proper aspect ratio (2.4:1)--it's essentially full-screen, in laymen's terms. This is also NOT the director's cut, so keys scenes, like the shooter at the school yard, are not in this film. Considering they're in a war against Blu-Ray, I'm not sure what prompted them to take and press a substandard edition to HD DVD, but bottom line is save your money and wait for them to do it right."
3,FOR ALL ACTION FANS,A family man police officer is teamed with a suicidal and homicidal partner to track down a group of killers dealing drugs
1,This isn't an action movie,"Why there were three sequels to this is beyond me. All it is is a city prostitute committing suicide and her dad thinking about killing himself too. The action scenes are bad. Not Good, Bad."
3,"good story, average picture quality","I've seen this movie several times and its always good. The release of the HD DVD caused me to watch it yet again, but the picture quality is not as good as other releases like Training Day and Serenity. Maybe its because the movie is older, but there was a lot of film grain and/or noise particularly in dark scenes. This is particularly confusing because this is not a combo disc with limited space."
5,The best in the series,A great action movie with psycho cop Gibson with family man Glover are sent out to stop a drug rig. the beast part is at the end.
2,The Point Is,"Four stars for the movie and extras themselves but there's no sense in releasing a Blu-ray with an unfinished slipshod transfer like this one's got. It's one notch sharper than an upconverted DVD which isn't all that great. I saw this on Universal and A&E a few months back and it looked superb but don't raise the bar if you're buying this version, just go in expecting the worst and spare your disappointment."
4,80's cop duo at its best.....Glover/Gibson to the rescue!,"Pure 80's when you watch this movie but one of the best of the 80's. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are still the best cop duo ever regardless of what era. As you know, it has the kind of humor that make us all laugh back then....and now after i watched it again on FX, i still laugh. It is fantistic that i can still like an 80s movie but i also watch Fletch a few weeks ago and that is so lame now. LW series can hold its own against the best cop movies of this era and once you revisited it, you will go YESSHHHHH!!!! Check it out and laugh again..."
4,Leathal Weapon,"Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make a very good team on camera though they hate eachother off the camera.The Director's Cut version makesthe movie a little more packed with blood and gore and curse words and breif nudity in the begining with Mel Gibbson in his trailer.Pesonally I think Leathal Weapon 2,4 are the best in the series then this one then the third one is a lost cause, Joe Pecci made it a little bit to much of a comedy and not an action movie unlike the first and second.Pecci made his first appearance in the 2nd installment in the series as a zainy guy who went by the name of Leo Getz. Alright the bottom line is if you want to get a good movie from this series get this one the second or the fourth."
2,80s action relic,"A cop who is starting to feel his age (Danny Glover) is teamed with a recent widower who just might have a death wish (Mel Gibson). The uneasy partnership is cemented when they run afoul of a major drug smuggling ring.The chemistry between Glover and Gibson, along with a terrific performance by Gary Busey as a fearsome enforcer, is the best thing about this movie. However, this is an action film, and the action is outlandish and uninteresting. The plot is dull and hits every cliché in the book. The climax is particularly egregious."
5,ACTION AT ITS BEST,"LETHAL WEAPON is one of the best action films of the past twenty years. Mel Gibson as the suicidal Riggs and Danny Glover as his reluctant partner have a superb chemistry and handle the roles beautifully. Gary Busey and Mitchell Ryan are super bad guys and Glover's family appropriately sentimental. Some great action sequences, especially when Gibson and the jumper ""jump"" off the roof. Gibson shows his range, too, in the scenes involving his grief over the loss of his wife. The action is fast paced and LETHAL WEAPON spawned three sequels and made beaucoups of bucks....a great action film!"
4,wheres the rest,"I loved these movies and all I want to know is when are the 2 final installments going to be released, been far too long for them not to also be out on blu-ray. Anyone else agree???"
5,Must have to Complete Lethal Weapon Collection,The DVD came on time and in perfect condition. The movie stays true to the previous Lethal Weapon movies. Danny and Mel are great together. I wish they would come out with another!
3,Good Movie,This is a good movie. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are great together. It has funny lines in a lot of scenes. But this is NOT for kids. I just saw this movie today for the FIRST time. I love cop movies. So see this movie today. It's worth 4 showings.Both in R and NR versions. Both versions contain Nudity and Strong Language.Running Time: 117 Minutes.
3,"It's all chemistry, folks.","Let's face it. The plot is poor. It is typical TV police partner drama stuff. Starsky and Hutch all the way. However, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are shining stars in this otherwise dull sky. It is not just their superb acting ability, but the chemistry between the two that made this movie so successful. The two are brilliant together, being even better than the sum of the parts. They took a barely mediocre movie and made it a gem. I would bet my DVD collection that if it had been any body else in the roles of Riggs and Murtaugh, this movie would not have even spawned one sequel, much less three."
3,Techno for kids?,"Bought this cd because I heard the Haunted House track on a podcast, and couldn't find it on Itunes. . .etc anywhere else by itself. A good price and to my surprise Medimops is the name of a music store in Germany, not the name of someone who does janitorial work at a hospital with an amazon account. I haven't heard any of the other tracks yet, but it's on my ipod so it's only a matter of time."
1,Secret Games 3,"This so-called unrated version should be rated PG. I have the version taped from cinemax, and it is much better. I bought this DVD thinking it was that version. Boy, was I wrong. If you want hot & steamy, don't buy this one. It's not even luke warm."
3,action,This movie is about a wife who wants some good action. She becomes a whore and becomes the obsession of one man. Rochelle Swanson is hot. Doesn't have much variety in formations though. Good looking chick. Could have thought out the sex scenes better.
4,SLEEK AND SEXY,"This video is the story of many wives in todays world though we are afraid to face the fact it is true. Watch it, review it, and our stories will match."
5,Truly a beautiful work...,"I have never read such a beautiful piece of work. I recommend it for anyone who loves beauty, intrigue, love of fantasy...I can't explain it...I am in love! I love the next book as well, but I am still waiting on the last book because I am poor! I need it in paperback!"
2,Was better the first time around when it was called MAIA,"After reading all the great reviews, I paid for the hardcover expecting a great fantasy read. However, I was disappointed overall. While I admire many of the descriptives - the author has crafted some beautiful passages, I think this book is very similar to Richard Adams' Maia. It is difficult to read Kushel's Dart and not compare it to Maia. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to Maia in the comparison. What I look for in a good fantasy read is a believable fantasy world. I don't think the fantasy holds up."
2,Glad I only spent a dollar,"Very disappointed...got it from the book bin at the local thrift store. I thought to myself, why would anyone give away such a seemingly good book. But I now see why.......very wordy. Author obviously was never taught that less is often more. Though the story had lots of potential, I couldn't force myself past chapter 6. I kept hoping it would get better and it didn't."
2,set in the world of gobbedegook,"Having purchased this book on the basis of the reviews I read ,I'm sorry to say I just could not stay with it , I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of buying this to read a few sample pages before purchase , the names given to the kingdoms,the countries , and the characters made it impossible for me to follow , I can only presume its a slow burner , I could find no empathy with any of the characters , no sense of a plot developing , and by the time I had read about 30% no interest in turning the next page ."
5,An alternate history of religion,"This is one of those books that leaves you with the feeling that it had to be written, that all the characters really exist ""somewhere"", and that the countries are places you could really go. This can only be a little bit because they are based on real countries - this scenery and those cultures begin where our myths and histories leave off, and owe more to imagination than reality. It is the author who is to be thanked for her magnificent contribution to speculative literature. Thank you!"
2,Good plot bogged down by detail,"Although the main character and the overall plot are pleasing and well developed, the main storyline is too crowded by pointless details. Carey adds too many political people with complicated histories and backgrounds for one to even follow it. I found myself constantly forgetting who was who and what they did 5oo years ago with this person who was the son of this person who did whatever. On top of that the main character, however likable, is a prostitute that does some pretty graphic things just to please her patrons, all in the service of her ""godess"". In the end she sells herself for for money towards her freedom. It doesn't exactly send the best message out to young women. After the first book I was so overwhelmed with the amount of rather pointless information that I couldn't bring myself to finsish the series. However, for people who have the patience to remember overwhelming detail and believe prostitution in the name of an idol is fine, this book is great."
5,...just one more thought...,"I realize that I just finished a review for this book, but after reading some other reviews, I wanted to add another thought.Jacquline Carey is a new writer on the level of Guy Gavriel Kay. I am highly surprised that anyone would compare her to Martin or Jordan--neither of them could approach the quality and complexity that infused Kushiels Dart. I have read widely in both the science fiction and fantasy genres, and only Tolkien and Kay have displayed the talent and lushness of description possessed by Carey.While Martin certainly has talent, don't try to compare him with Carey--there is no comparison. Don't get me started on Jordan. Besides, a real Jordan fan probably wouldn't like this book anyway."
4,A Necessary Intro to an Amazing Series,"The first half of this book is dry, lots of mapping out the geography, family lines, who's who, history, and introductions. It gets textbooky at times, but if you can stick with it, you find yourself definitely immersed and knowledgeable of the setting. Which makes the story all the richer when real plot twisting events start taking place.There is some serious storytelling going on here, and I found that once I got past the first 200 or so pages, I couldn't put it down. The next two books manage to get even better. The characters are very well fleshed out, and I found myself loving Phadré, her experiences, antics, highs lows, and everything in between.I'm not a real fan of the fantasy genre, but this does not dissapoint. Multilayered, complex fantasy for adults."
4,I liked it more as I read more,"It took a while for me to be able to keep all of the characters straight, but around 1/2-3/4 of the way through the book, everyone was FINALLY becoming familar enough to me that I could really get into it. Maybe I found it so hard b/c of the derivations of the names, but overall, I loved this book and can't wait until I read the next one!"
1,The paperback costs the same?,"This review is for the price of the Kindle version.I've read this book. I've read the sequels. I enjoy this author and her characters.I bought a Kindle to hold a number of books in one area without taking up the space that even one paperback does (I'm in the Navy; I don't have room to take too many books on deployment) AND because in my mind, ebooks should be cheaper than physical because there are less producing costs.So why on earth is the Kindle price for these books the same as a paperback? What is the point of buying a $150 electronic storage for books that don't have any further content than the words on the screen, to pay a price for a physical copy that takes up more storage and can be lent/resold/given away, etc? Wouldn't publishers make more money by supplying more ebooks and cheaper costs since it's harder to transfer those files than a physical book?"
3,didn't love it,I'm still trying to get through it. I want to love it. It was recommended through a friend. I'm just having a hard time getting through it.
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I read this book after noticing the second in the series, which has a very sexy cover (Kushiel's Chosen), and wondering what IT was about. I'm not a big fan of ""fantasy"" novels, but I enjoyed this one. And I kept trying to figure out which real medieval countries and nationalities and people the fantasy ones corresponded with. The story had enough romance, court and political intrigue, and adventure to keep me turning pages long into the night several times. Phaedre is a unique and engaging heroine, although her perfection and zeal was a little hard to swallow sometimes. The author includes an exhausive list of characters and their relationships, and I think it would have been helpful if she had given a little more background on the ""religious"" characters and their traits. If you enjoyed the ""Outlander"" series by Diana Gabaldon, you'll probably enjoy this book. I can't wait to read ""Kushiel's Chosen""!"
5,This book is fantastic!,"I love this book! I've already finished reading the second in the series, and am waiting on the third as a Christmas gift. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre or author."
5,Awsome book!,"I've have become recent fan of Jacqueline Carey, this book is great for all sorts of types of reader, great combination, of romance, sci-fi, adventure, and some very nice steamy sex... Never has a book offer so much varity in one book. Jacqueline use of detail is amazing.."
4,Very good read.,"I bought this book when the second book in the series caught my eye. And how could it not? The artwork on the cover is fantastic. The book itself is well written, without any detectable grammar or spelling errors. The author's style is good and it was very easy to connect to the characters and fall in love with them. The book is a little fuzzy near the end about what happens to the main character and her guardian, but other than that it was wonderful. If you like cunning and book full of plots and counterplots, then you should like this."
1,Boring and Pretentious is a Really Bad Combination,"This book reads as if it was written by an inexperienced college girl who is majoring in French and watched ""The Story of O"" too many times.To start with it's very annoying when fantasy writers are too lazy to create a fantasy world that suits their story. So they just take the map of Europe, muddle up the names of things and write as if they are writing alternative history (which they aren't).Beautiful, boring and smug people engaging in lots of silly mock-sophisticated sex and boring political intrigue. I don't think I can remember any time that an author managed to maintain such consistent shallowness over such a long book.And it seems that there are multiple sequels. I'm stunned."
2,Not the *Worst*,"There were WAY too many names in this book for me to keep track of. I realize that most people don't have as much difficulty with this as I do, which is why I gave two stars instead of one, but I can't help that it colored my opinion. I had an impossible time following who was backstabbing who, which made me concentrate on faults that I normally would have let slide. The sex scenes are boring, the characters are cookie-cutter, and the author rambles on and on and on. It gets some points for having a *slightly* more original setting than many other fantasy series, and for not using magic as a trump card in every scene, but that's about it."
1,Intellectually Offensive,"I find all the slathering of praise on this book to be silly. Certainly the author is literate, but the prose is one big self-gratification that I prefer not to participate in. I am not offended by the sex itself--even though all the bodice-ripper descriptions of ""hard veined phalluses"" hardly impress to the level I expected after a gushing Kirkus review. It is the persepctive that is bothersome. Perhaps few other readers don't take offense at the sort of content that abounds in this tasteless book, but if you put golden wrapping on manure, it's still manure; you can foist it off on a lot more people, however."
4,Take the time to get hooked,"The first book in the series is amazing. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of magic, however Carey weaves a powerful and moving story. ALL the following novels I would rate a 5 the reason the first I have given 4 is the first chunk of the book with all the French style names makes it hard to follow. Once you understand who is who and the groundwork is laid the story takes off. Very mature, I loved it and strongly suggest you try it"
5,K.I.S.S.,"I will keep this review short and simple, as others have writen enough to let you know what the storie line is. THIS BOOK IS INCREADABLE, it will keep your interest from cover to cover, and the second book in the series is, if possable, even better! I can hardly wait for the next book to come out!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Subterfuge and sex.The main focus of this book is a young woman who is trained as a courtesan, but has a minor biological flaw. It turns out that this is important, and a rare sign of her being a supernaturally excellent example of a sadomasochistic sexual servant.Being really good as this also brings her to the attention of spymasters, given that sex and spying go rather well together.Reasonable book, but too long and hence gets tedious for me."
5,WOW,"Wow, after getting through the first pages, of difficult names and titles, you just cant stop! It has been a long time that I have read a book this good!"
2,A chore,"This is quite possibly the worst book I have read in sometime. I quit around page 200, and I commend those that went further.Disguising itself as an erotica book, but failing in every possible way in that aspect? Check. Bland, boring, grating prose? Check. Laughable dreary Mary-Sue of a main character? Check. Raping a major religion because author lacked any creativity? Check! I could go on, but you get the point.This book is bad Alternate Universe Biblical fanfic. I thought, in the beginning it might get better, but it actually got more boring, more repetitive and just downright annoying for me to give it any of my attention any longer. I think I need to read some Nabokov to cleanse my brain."
4,Can't put it down,"I started with the 4th one on accident. I loved it so much that I started again with the 1st one. This book was a page turner, it went everywhere with me. Phedre is an unforgettable character that will stay with me forever. I completely fell in love woth Joselin. 'He has replaced my first and only character love Haplo"" With deep undertones of religion and heavy with politics, there is not much magic. Heroic tales almost out of history, and sex scenes to get the brain thinking;) I absolutely love the way Jaqueline Carey writes. She is very talented, she gets right to the point. These books will always stay in my ""private collection"" Its the kind that you want to read slower to make them last longer, and faster to find out what happens. All in all, a fantastic read!"
5,Superb,"Was referred to Kushiel's Dart by a friend who referred me to Fifty Shades of Grey - was intrigued, and so dived into Kushiel's Dart after finishing Fifty Shades Trilogy - I must first say that the books are nothing alike except in the fact that they both contain the theme of darker side of sexual appetites-however I LOVED Kushiel's Dart even more than Fifty Shades-thank goodness there are sequels to Kushiel's Dart! If you love reading and loved Fifty Shades then try Kushiel's Dart on for size - i'll bet you won't be dissapointed!"
2,What's wrong with me?,"I rarely give up on books. I made it through 652 pages before I finally called it quits. Something about the universe just didn't gel with me, I just couldn't care about the intrigue between houses or any of the characters who were still alive at that point. Maybe I shouldn't have read it so soon after Game of Thrones, who knows? But it's not for me."
5,My new favorite book!,"KUSHIEL'S DART is an extraordinary epic set in a re-imagined medieval Europe. This is one of those rare books that combines an intricate plot with extremely well developed characters. The story is told through the voice of young Phédre nó Delaunay, a courtesan and spy in the country of Terre d'Ange but the supporting ""cast"" is given full attention as well-without bogging down in minutia.Throughout the sweeping epic, Jacqueline Carey never loses sight of the arch of the story so be forewarned: everything she writes is significant. At the end, you will see how she's tied all the pieces together into a tightly woven whole. Oh, but there is a window left open for a sequel. Whether you read this book because the characters are fascinating, the story fun and nerve-wracking, the writing exceptional, or the sense of place and religion so believable, I know you'll be satisfied. This is my new favorite book!"
2,Terry Goodkind's younger sister,"Ok, everybody, calm down. Once again we have breathless abandon of praise that is really very overblown [though explicit sexuality and S$M sometimes does that to people--I'm convinced that's why Terry Goodkind has a following.] To be fair, Carey is a better writer than Goodkind, but she has the same tendency to exploit the sex rather than really thinking out the society. In addition, her heroine has no vulnerability, and it's hard to root for such a know it all on any but the parody level. The ""we're Phedre's boys!"" song to me was SO anachronistic it made me want to scream.On the other hand, the sex is not the offensive part of this stroy. It's the reliance on it and the fact that this somehow yields praise."
1,major eye rollage,"I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at some scene or event. I liked Phedre, for the most part, but found her love-interest Joscelin to be annoyingly weak. He's suppose to be her body guard, but he's a wimp.Carey created a beautiful society with an interesting culture and completely lost me by using our own world as the setting. Was it just too difficult to create her own version a barbaric society, so she planted the Vikings in the story, instead?I've been told that you have to read the series to understand (""love"") the whole story, but I just can't get myself to pick up the next book."
5,A favorite.,"The unexpected artistry of description and emotion from the heroine, Phedre, was what won me over with this trio of books (Dart, Avatar, and Chosen). There is nothing else like them. Following the thought process is fantastic. The intrigue is singular among fantasy novels. So is the alternate world and religious history. The first book is Careys best. I've read them all. None of her others come close, but they try!"
2,Betimes I Review A Book?,"The writing is excessively florid, and the fancypants archaic words are often used incorrectly. For instance, I really wish Ms. Carey's editors would let her know that betimes means early, not ""at times."""
1,Boring,"I love a good epic story but Kushiel's Dart is not one of them. I had to force myself to get though the first 300 pages and then I gave up.There was no excitment and I had no interest in the main character who to me comes off as shallow and emotionless. None of the characters were interesting enough to keep me involved, a page turner it's not.I had high hopes for the book but it wasn't exciting, erotic or an adventure, everyone just seems bored and jaded. Yet I suppose if your entire life worth is based on your skills as a high priced courtesan then you're going to be jaded, but it still doesn't make you interesting."
5,Simply Brilliant! Hooray for Ms. Carey! :-),"I am a lover of fantasy and an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction alike. About this book, all I can say is:OhMyGoodness!The other reviews will give you a sense of the book. I would agree that the first 100 or so pages in this book was a wee bit tedious to get through, but Ms. Carey is laying the foundation for an amazing trilogy, so the reading time is WELL worth it.Ms. Carey's inner world must be phenomenal to give birth to such a story. And I can only begin to imagine the joys and difficulties that writing such a trilogy would offer the writer.So - on behalf of fantasy lovers everywhere - thank you, Ms. Carey for bringing forth this trilogy"
5,Not for the weak of vocabulary and geography...,"I love this book because it brings such intelligence, depth, and intrigue to the art of the courtesan. I love it because it is more of what you want historical chick fiction for. I love to travel vicariously and the novel's heroine is all about travel. The cast of characters is totally entertaining. It's not for everyone...but if you like adult fiction, it's a great long ride."
4,The life of a sexual masochist call girl,"Things I liked about this book: epic world-building, some beautiful and insightful lines of prose, and a portrayal of the life of a masochist that makes them understandable and human to me. I felt for the main characters, and cared what happened to them. The political scene was believable and interesting.Things I didn't like about this book: heavy-handed foreshadowing, unnessesary archiac and french-like words, too much ""telling"" and not enough action. It was too long - especially the first third, which was slow. This book would be better at about 70% of its current length. Also, does this world not have any form of birth control? If not, why doesn't Phedre have 10 kids? I also would have liked to have read about other sado-masochist relationships in Valerian House, so I could see what exactly was so rare and different about an anguissette."
4,Great Book,Thanks for a great book. Does great to find obscure books. This is a great series. Bought the set and love them. Great author!!
4,"Very good, but can be confusing","The first part of the book, when Phedre is in training, is wonderful. Had the book stopped there, it would have gotten a 5.The action continues to be wonderful, but the secondary characters start getting confusing. (There is a listing in the front, but it only gives basic information.) If you read this book, do not take a break of more than a day or 2 (unless you have an amazing memory), else you run the risk of not remembering all the political factions once you start up again."
2,Angelique revisted.,"I haven't read anything like this since the Angilique novels of the early 70's. Our heroine is both slave and independent female. She likes both roles.This was not a fantasy, it was a cheap romance with a formulaic plot set in a quasi mideval world. I will pass on the sequel."
2,Perverse and overblown,"I find first person writing hard to get into in the first place. Now I have to wonder what is up with Tor. Child prostitution, rape, and all other forma of perversion seem to gather great reviews but left me with my stomach turned.This is certainly a carefully written book, so I gave it an extra star, but the plot is dully buried under the titallation and I did not find the characters appealing. I guess sex sells."
1,boring and unimaginative,"The characters seemed flat, almost stereotypical. The religious aspect didn't help.The world, based on medieval europe, wasn't imaginatively constructed. This itself isn't so bad, but the lack of imagination seemed to spill over into other parts of the book as well, such as the characters and religion, which were at most variations on various well-known, standard forms.The prose seemed ponderous to me. I also didn't like the foreshadowing aspect.On a normal day I would give the book a 2 as it had a (very) few redeeming qualities, but seeing all the 5's, I have to say ""Why?"" and give it a 1."
1,Would never support or recommend this company,"I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone! First of all they don't support the military stationed overseas and second customer stinks. Customer service was very rude and not willing to work with us. They asked for a street address and when I notified them that we are stationed overseas due to military orders they wrote back and stated these exact words with no explanation ""We have canceled your order."""
5,Excellent Information - And Fun To Read!,"You know when you read a really good story, how difficult it isto put the book down?Well, you don't expect to have the feeling when you read a book about financial planning and wealth creation do you?Yet, that's just what happened to me. I picked up my copy of James' book and couldn't put it down until reading the very last page. Since then, I've read it over several more times and found some things I missed.Bringing money in hasn't been the problem for me, keeping moreof it certainly has - James' has some great advice and practical techniques that worked for him - retired at 38 - NICE!Highly recommended.Jeff"
5,Saves my hand and my back,"I really like using the GearGripPro computer tote. Trying to carry a desktop computer, especially a mini tower, cut off the circulation in my hand from the case corner, and strained my back as I bent over to balance the weight. I highly reccomend this as an ergonomic device. The soft grip is easy on my hand, and being able to hold it straight down instead of out to the side helps me walk upright without straining my back. Having the pockets for a keyboard and mouse as well as straps to hold cables really completes the package. Now, if they could come up with a tote for a monitor..."
4,Good Glasses,"It helps me a lot when i am in front of the computer, so my sight is less tired than before."
3,Good and light,The glasses are as advertised. They look very nice and are effective computer glasses. But the material is plastic and they are very light. Be careful or you will break them. I would recommend that you find a harder case for them.
2,Not for the faint of heart,"As a new student to the field of SQL Server 2005, I was hoping to obtain a book learning the various methods of programming in SQL Server 2005. I was initially hearted by the first paragraph in the preface:""You don't need to be an experienced SQL Server 2005 programmer to use this book...""which is indeed the case if you intend to use it as a paper weight.The book suspiciously looks like the syntax guide found in most MS products: the procedure name and inputs followed by a description of the inputs. It is not for the beginner/intermediate learner and is somewhat of a disappointment comming from the O'Reilly range (""SQL on SQL Server 2005"" is an excellent counter point to the book being reviewed from the same publisher). This book serves mainly as a reference (which on page 7, it clearly states that it is not a reference) to new doctrine in the SQL Server evolution."
4,Learning SQL Server 2005,"'Programming SQL Server 2005' by Bill Hamilton is a nice book, but the title is a bit misleading (in a sense). When it says '2005', this books MEANS 2005. For a book that says ""Programming"" in the title, I would expect a thorough examination of discussing the old AND new of SQL Server, but this text decides to focus on the new gadgets and abilities that the 2005 generation provides, without focussing specifically on the existing programming features/abilities.At nearly 600 pages this book sounds like it's a good amount of material, but for any book that says programming and with a topic so diverse, I would expect more.If you are looking to find out more about what SQL Server 2005 provides, create some applications that talk to your database server using the Visual Studio 2005 suite and get up to speed, this is a nice resource, but I cannot give it 5 stars as it just doesn't jump off the page for me like I would have hoped.**** RECOMMENDED"
2,Boring and inaccessible,"This book is very inaccessible, not because it is too complex, but because it is poorly written. If you'd like to actually learn SQL Server programming I'd recommendProfessional SQL Server 2005 Programming (Programmer to Programmer)."
3,hard to read,didn't expect it to be like reading about a group therapy session. Was too long and drawn out to hold my attention
3,Not sure,"I bought this video after watching over the internet an EFT video. The video is long and boring about the participants who attended the seminar. I do believe their testimony is important, but it was just too long. They are not clear explaining why the method works.I have tried tapping 5 times but I have not seen any changes. Dont waste your money"
1,The Tapping Solution,This is awful. I am very interested in EFT and have read a couple of books about it and attended a workshop on it. Thought this DVD would be insightful or even inspiring but it was neither. It goes into very little detail or depth regarding EFT. What a waste of money>
3,Emma,"I did have some serious problems receiving this product, not from Amazon but the company itself. I ordered right after they had a World Tapping Summit and had a huge influx of orders. It took over a month to receive the DVD. The DVD was used to introduce a group of people to Tapping that knew nothing about this whole process. I like the fact that the DVD has a section on ""How To Tap' that is a choice to play. The story is actually case histories of a group of people with various conditions that come together for a weekend to learn and apply tapping. This was an excellent introduction for this group that I showed it to and it did stimulate interest in following through with more tapping."
5,An excellent history about food and fellings,"This movie is about the food and the pleasure of eating it. The performances of the actors are just great, if you like gastronomi and romance, you will enjoy this masterpiece."
5,Sumptuous. Spellbinding. Unforgetable.,"This is one of those foreign films that manages to make you forget completely that you are following the dialogue via subtitles. An acclaimed chef takes refuge in a small village cooking for a monastic family of sisters whose diet is plain and unvaried. Fortune blesses the chef and she seeks to repay this family by cooking them a feast literally fit for royalty. A story about spirit, acceptance, faith, sacrifice, generosity and ultimately love, it ranks in my top ten favorite films of all time."
3,Babette's Feast,"I was told several times that this is 'a must see movie, a beautiful movie that would make you feel all warm and fuzzy' but I found it to be a very slow movie that finally gets to the point --- I think. But then again I watched it on a very slow rainy day ---------- perhaps that was my mistake ???? The one saving grace is that in Australia the DVD only costs $19.95 as opposed to prices as high as $USD 149.99 advertised on Amazon. Thank God I live in Australia."
1,Babettes feast,DVD received is not formatted to play on my machine. Needs to be Zone-4 format. I am unable to play the DVD forwarded to me.
4,visually pleasant,"The movie was visually pleasant. I found it to be metaphorical enough to merit a second and perhaps a third and later on a fourth and fifth watching. I am interested in the concept of an old man binding a group of followers to the memory of his charismatic and dead teachings for a long while, even though they themselves have lost sight of any truth in anything he might have taught. Religion deadens passion and enjoyment and truth and the capacity for relationship. People will gladly substitute the memory of a dead man's teaching for pleasure, whether it be in eating or drinking or exploring one's God given gifts... whether it be love, or children, or learning. People believe they have made a good trade. Because they have failed to face life, they have not made mistakes, and because of this they believe they are good. People go gently to hell never having lived."
3,a disappointment,"Having heard for several years how wonderful this movie was I fully expected to love it. A small women's group with which I am associated invited me to view it with them last night.Depressing and irritating are the words that come to mind to describe the film. Long, meaningful glances, unrequited yearning, annoying characters fill the scenes. The most interesting aspect of the film is the physical location. The sense of place is wonderful. The depiction of dogmatic religious practices is, if accurate, disheatening.So, I can only give it a lukewarm rating. Only the food was hot."
2,WEIRRRRRD,"My husband and I just couldn't see how food was a spiritual experience. We're religious, too. It looked like a movie to love, but it made no real sense. I guess you have to be French or is it Danish?"
2,Didn't get it,"I'm honestly puzzled by all the rave reviews. On the bright side, there are a fair number of nice touches in the presentation of the feast itself, and I can imagine it making a nice short story. However, as a movie it feels very old-fashioned and not in a good way when it comes to camera work and pacing. Most of the characters are two-dimensional and the music is uninspiring. Perhaps you have to be religious."
2,Slow as molasses,"This movie would have made a nice 30 minute short film. The final 30 minutes showing the ""feast"" is somewhat entertaining but the 70 minutes leading up to it will put you to sleep."
1,"Boring, Slow, pre-feminist movement","I made my way through about 40 minutes of this film and finally had to turn it off. The ""love"" stories are absurd. The ""lovers"" scarcely even speak to one another. The point of view is mostly from the male lovers' perspective, and they look at these women as sweet little charming ornaments. I don't know what a modern viewer could possibly take from this film, other than to be thankful that most men today now see women as friends and companions, perfectly equal in moral, spiritual, and intellectual capacity, and vice versa.For a depiction of the ""wild woman"" who rolls through town and scandalizes the populace with her sensuous cooking skills, I prefer Chocolat!"
3,Moviefan,"I agree that ""Feast"" is subtle, sensitive and profound and the centerpiece of the film, both visually and thematically,the fact is the movie is slow and sometimes sleepy, nevertheless this movie is rich in two ways; the first one is related about the lonelyness of this two sisters and the big sacrifice they made to live with their father leaving their chances of living aside.The other one is related to losses and regreats, and this fact is related to Babete's personal drama (she losses everything) and how she understands the only thing she got then is the two sisters of this lonely and remote place, giving them this fest who represents her gift of life to these ladies, the movie touches humen sense and regreat."
5,A visual masterpiece !,"I've read most of these reviews, and I can't improve upon them. But reading them brings a flood of awe back to me. An Absolutely mesmorizing feast for the eyes !"
5,Sublime,"This is a fascinating film. I'm appreciative of a large breadth of movies, but consider myself more of the <action/adventure> type rather that the <art film> type. The first time I watched it, I felt that it started out so slow, why am I still watching? And yet it was easy to keep watching. It's a movie that I have watched probably 50 times over the last 3 years, and still enjoy immensely.The original actor's voices are so rich, the subtitled version is the only way to go. The dubbed version I saw on television a short while ago was abysmal by comparison."
5,Excellent film,"This film is excellent, and this edition has lots of options for subtitles and dubbed languages."
5,Most uplifting and profound,I have recommended this movie to my family and friends many times. It is one of the most inspiring movies I've seen in 81-years. If only I had learned its lessons when I was young.
4,Beware: there be poetry here...,"The setting, plot and acting all work harmoniously.""How many years of victory, end in defeat?""How many years of defeat, end in victory?""How you will delight the angels!""I liked the movie and was glad I watched it."
5,"Spectacular, delicious, beautiful","Toward the end of this beautiful movie, the origin of the title becomes clear. Babette, a refugee, has spent 14 years as a cook in the home of two fervently religious sisters who live in a village of like-minded, conservative, ser-in-their-own-ways country folk. When Babette wins the lottery, she (a former gourmet chef) spends every centime on the preparation of a sumptuous feast of many courses with separate wines for each as her offering of gratitude for their sheltering her.To watch the arrival of the exotic ingredients, the preparation, the serving, the gradual loosening of tight strictures as the villagers sample, taste, savor, and dive in, tongues and belts and opinions gradually loosened by the effects of exquisite food and wine, is to be seduced as surely as by a lover.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. This is the movie, made in 1988, that started the spate of other food genre films."
5,Babette's Feast,"""Feast"" is subtle, sensitive and profound. The centerpiece of the film, both visually and thematically, is the magnificent meal that Babette prepares for her austere benefactors after winning a lottery-the significance of which soon becomes evident. With Axel's restrained direction and superb performances all around, ""Feast"" earned an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, and deserves an honorary spot at any film or food lover's table. Don't miss the old general's concluding speech!"
5,Philosophical legend,"As the title says, this legned was put on the background of french revolution, but its philosophical significance reaches far beyond, before and after that specific historic period. Issue has been probably pursued by human being since they became civilized gradually: what is the persistant value of life, relatively unchanged by uncertainty of world. The movie offers some clue for people to follow to practically explore in today's real world."
5,Food was never better in a movie,This movie is a glorious affirmation of life and food.The dinner prepared by Babette changes the lives of allthe characters there. The sheer pleasure of food is rightthere on the screen. As is the pleasure of companionshipand love that the dinner also provides.This is a wonderful movie and I always like to be ableto say this - no one gets shot.
5,What a Feast!,"I saw the movie 10 years ago. Last night I rented it from Block Buster. I watch it twice last night. The movie is so good, and so touch. Finally, I found the place to buy it."
5,My Goodness!,This is a movies that I have to watch at least once a year. It makes me weep! Enuf said!
4,"An often lyrical, beautiful movie","This movie details the intersection of the lives of two somewhat reclusive daughters of a Danish religious leader and of a Parisian chef who comes to live with them for political reasons.This movie really stands up to multiple viewings. At first, it seems that the director is more or less unsympathetic to the rigor of the daughters' religion. But after seeing it umpteen million times, I think that there is a real respect shown to their strength and integrity. And, in fact, the very sensualness of Babette's feast simply complements the starkness of their lifestyle."
5,dour danes learn to party,"The story is set in the late nineteenth century and takes place in a small fishing village on the dank and dreary Jutland coast of Denmark. A band of dour Christians learn the meaning of God's extravagant grace from a most unlikely source. If ever there was a film as parable, this is it."
3,A DRAG!,I watched this movie in eigth grade french. Let me tell you i really didn't like it. I understand everything about it but come babbette makes some nasty stuff! I also think that babbette was portrayed as someone who when she won the lottery was exploted for her francs.
5,One of the most brillant books I have read in a long time.,This book is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. It shows the stark reality of life and the cruilty in the world. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a book that is different from all others you have read.
4,Good value for the money.,I bought this set for a family member. The quality is pretty good. The pattern is versatile.
5,Move over Tom Clancy....,"I'd say move over Tom Clancy, but this book came out a long time before Tom Clancy. It was a very well written book by someone who was actually there. I'm not sure but I think it might have been somewhat autobiographical. If you get a chance you should check out some of the other books by this author, especially Submarine which I belive is a followup to this book and Cold Is the Sea which has the same character but entering the nuclear age."
1,Don't trust the title of this book,"If anything, this book confirms that ontology work is still very much confined to university labs.It contains very little about ontologies (the 8-pages chapter 2, and a quick description of some ontology languages in chapter 6), and much about :- the author's own ""Ontobroker"" research (Chapter 3)- a presentation of e-commerce for those of us who have lived on a desert island in the past 5 years (chapter 4)- a description of XML and XSL (chapter 5)[The Price] is a [bit] steep price for 100 pages of information that is freely and easily available on the web."
2,inconsistent and expensive,"This book is, as someone above said very hastily written. It repeats itself, and has a tacky structure, despite its 138 pages (references included). With that in mind, the price is quite hefty. but there are lots of references, which is a plus. There must be better books or papers out there which introduces ontologies."
3,"Good title, hasty content!","The book leaves impression of a quickly put together text. It does contain important references and web pointers, but could have been much better. I am mildly dissapointed."
1,all the same,"To tell you the truth, this type of metal stinks. Is antiquated, boring, outdated and most of all very very repetitive. A word of advice if you want a library collection of this type of metal just try to buy a single from what ever random band of power matal, it can be either stratovarius, blind guardian whatever, and listen to just one song, and there is your power metal library, in other words it all sounds the same: melody, repetitive double bass drum.... and terrible 80's vocals.There was only one band that could truly play this type of metal to perfection, and that band was Helloween."
4,I LIKE IT!,"How original is my above title? anyway, this CD contains some of the most amazing energy I've ever heard from a group. Wings of Destiny could very well be one of my all-time favorite songs! I think the first few songs and the last few songs starting with Wings of D are very good.. the middle songs including Heavy Metal Universe and the Metallica-like Short as Hell don't quite measure up... I truly believe that GRay does better sticking to their 'guns', so to speak, by blasting out those beautiful and frenzied choruses of melodies... as opposed to diversifying their sound or perhaps experimenting with other bands' sounds. I'm not sure which I like better - Land of the Free or PowerPlant - but if the recent reviewer is right in saying that Somewhere o i Space is better than both of them... well... I can hardly wait to hear it!"
2,nowhere near as good as Somewhere Out In Space,"this follow-up to Somewhere Out in Space is nowhere near as good. Fewer great melodies and lyrical ideas. Closer in content to the album prior to SOIS, Land of the Free, but with the great drumming of Dan Zimmerman. Kai's vocals not as good as on SOIS. Still, there are some nice uptempo tracks such as: Gardens of the Sinner, Wings of Destiny, and Armeggeddon. Also contains a nice cover of the Pet Shop Boys' It's A Sin."
2,My 1st and last Gamma Ray,"Bought this CD in a used bin for $3 glad i didnt pay full price. Had heard good things about the band from other metal fans, but this disc is disappointing.The 1st few songs are ok, then it slides into cheesy, average power metal. Kai Hansen's musical talent isnt in question, just the songwriting/lyrics.Maybe (probably) there are better Gamma Ray discs out there, but i wont risk $15 or so to find out after hearing this."
3,not what I expected.,"I saw a review on another Gamma Ray album and the person said these guys are as heavy as Black Sabbath,man he was far off. These guys are slightly heavy but not nearly as heavy as Fear Factory,Slayer etc. Maybe it's heavy to a soft Power Metal fan but not to real metal fans. The vocals are power,the drums are quiet(but sometimes fast)and the guitars are too light and slow. I still liked it a bit but if you are a Power Metal fan I recommend Blind Guardian. If you are a Thrash or Death Metal fan don't buy any Power Metal albums because they suck!"
4,Great music!,"I need you to ignore my other review because I didn't give it enough time. There is some great music on this cd,it's fast,fairly heavy and clear sounding. The drums are good and fast and the vocals are slightly raspy and powerful. The guitarist is talented but the bass is nothing to shout about ""but who cares!"""
3,Average Fluff,"Call me crazy, but to me, Gamma Ray represent the Backstreet Boys of power metal. A lot of pretty fluff with little substance. Sure, they have killer hooks here and there, but in general I find it very disposable: nothing really grips me. Bands like Angra and Shadow Gallery have depth, Gamma Ray is plain superficiality. Extra star for covering It's a Sin, it sounds great."
1,Atrociously performed and not worth the money.,There are so many better ragtime albums that this one that all I can do is recommend that you purchase one of the others. This one features hamfisted playing with insensitive and mechanical performances and and a badly tuned piano.
5,A Quick and Painless Way to Learn VBA,"This book is really a CD with some 1323 PowerPoint slides on how to program VBA on Access. This is a way to do computer based training that I've never seen before, and it works pretty well. It's planned for a ten day lesson. It requires that you have PowerPoint 2000 or later installed.The author is Dr. Gerard Verschuuren. He is a Microsoft Certified Professional specializing in VA, VBA and VD.Net. When used by a pro, PowerPoint is quite a powerful package, offering ways to highlight, emphasize and add notes to the stock presentation. Dr. Verschuuren is ceratainly a pro at Powerpoint. His slides are well done, colorful and a rather painless way to learn VBA.Every few slides there is a quick multiple choice question to make sure that you've learned what was covered in the previous few slides. I used this disk on my notebook while on a series of airplane flights. It was a rather painless way of learning something new. This concept worked very well for me."
5,Strongest black tea,Awake. The name says it all. This is the strongest bagged black tea I know of. Not for those who like a milder black tea.
2,why the huge rise in price?,I agree -- this tea will make you quit coffee! I did. But the rise in price from just over $20 to nearly $28 since June will make me look elsewhere to purchase this tea!
2,Disappointed...,"I ordered this product because the picture was of the old packaging of Awake tea.The solid red box is no longer available in local stores. My plan was to stockpile since the new Awake has a different taste. Instead of what I ordered, I received six boxes of Awake Tea in the new packaging. Not a fan and it less expensive locally than what I paid online."
5,Love,I've been a loyal bigelow drinker for years but this tea has made me a tazo convert. It has the best black tea flavor of any tea I have tried.
4,very tight,Toot is a strate playah.I was put up on his tape Toot from Drama life(which I haven't been able to find since) In Columbus Ohio from his homey Big Keeb from Playhouse Music and I used to bump the hell out of it.Omaha Is really a down City that people aint really woke to but they got flavah.
4,Entertaining,"While the title of the book may make you turn away, the content is amusing and you just don't want to put the book down. The book is cute about two friends in their teens following around an alien who has overtaken Britney's body. I recommend this book for pop music fans who don't want to take this book too seriously."
1,blah!,"I couldn't get past the first ten pages. I know it is fiction, but it was to the point of rediculous."
4,How it felt,"In this book, Louis Guilloux, a writer and member of the French resistance, gives us a great depictionof the days during (and after) the liberation of France.It narrates the story of Louis, a member of the French resistance, that becomes for a few weeks a translator for the U.S military.At the center of the story are the trials against african-american soldiers and the shock of observing how unaware the white american officers were of the racism in the U.S military.Guilloux pen is a generous one. He witholds easy judgements, but is not shy in expressing his own views. Overall this little novel is a great read."
2,This book is not worth purchasing.,"This Japanese Financial Dictionary is not worth buying if you have access to an electronic dictionary. Although there are some specialized terms not available in ordinary Japanese-English dictionaries, they are few and far between. Far superior Financial Dictionaries have been produced by Japanese publishers."
5,Fiskars Garden Hoe #9663,"yes, it's a GARDEN HOE, not a back yard one, for that I'll have to buy another one for serious digging, very light, very well built, works well with either glove or bare handed, cuts roots of weeds pretty well, and dug up half inch of soil if you want to, because of the angle of the head part, it's not possible to dig more than that. Did cut a 2 inch root with only one strike and get the job done, excellent shock absorbing shaft."
2,not really sharp,I don't understand how this hoe can be considered sharp - mine arrived dull and I have not been able to get a real edge on it. What I would give for a good hoe! As far as I can tell they no longer exist. I am very disappointed.
4,Good for weeding...,"I have not used this yet but my wife has. She said that it felt cheap in her hands, although it has not broke yet (will post an update if it does). However, the orange handle (at the top) kept slipping off. Like stated in one of the other reviews, it will work well for weeding a garden, but for digging trenches in the back yard or cutting roots or something, I would get a heavier duty hoe like the one from Bully Tools... they make EXCELLENT quality stuff, and all in the USA.in case anyone was wondering...http://www.amazon.com/Bully-92353-2-Inch-Garden-Fiberglass/dp/B0031575GS/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1336739876&sr;=1-1"
1,Terrible Heat Dissipation,"The packaging claims that this enclosure has aluminum housing. Indeed, it appears as though the top and bottom are aluminum, but the entire interior structure is plastic. The drive sits on plastic and makes no contact with any aluminum. There are no air holes for ventillation and there is no fan. You might as well put your drive in a toaster."
2,"Works well, but...","I bought this from CompUSA for $20 on sale. For that price it does about what I wanted for it to use as a back-up drive. However, when its left in use the hard drive can become alarmingly hot. It hardly dissipates to the outside of the case at all. While the aluminum casing was only moderately hot I opened it to find that the hard drive was so hot it couldn't be handled directly. The plastic lining inside prevents good heat dissipation. However it is small and sleak and I don't leave it on all the time.At $45 though, there are far better and far cheaper enclosures. The only good thing I can really say about this is that it works fine without problems I've heard with other enclosures. Still, its not worth it.In conclusion:BUY SOMETHING ELSE"
1,Too hot,"This enclosure works fine, but it gets really hot. There is no ventilation whatsoever. I always try to turn the thing off when not in use since I'm worried about it shortening the life of my drive. Get another model that at least has ventilation if not a fan."
2,I can bend the knife!,"I ordered this set to figure out if I wanted to register for it for our upcoming wedding. I grew up with Oneida flatware - the pattern my folks had, Satinique, was discontinued and Oneida suggests this as a close match.In design, yes, it is a close match. The set is marked 18/10 and is nice with the exception of the knife. First, it feels light and hollow - it's lighter than the other pieces which makes no sense since it's made of the most material. I see no marking on it indicating it's Oneida, let alone 18/10. Astonished, I tried to bend the blade and it definately gives under little pressure. (Not a full bend, but a knife shouldn't flex). Looking more closely at the designs along the handle, it almost appears that black paint was used to create depth, as opposed to actual molds.I'm curious to see if ordering directly from Oneida yields a better product, or if there is just a lapse in quality. 18/10 - lies! My cheap set from Target is better quality."
5,A great book for beginners or experienced investors.,This book takes you step by step in helping one understand the concept of investing by breaking through the financial jargon. Every page has chart/examples and illustration that make it much easier to understand and comprehend.
5,"Fieser & Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Vol. 1 1967","This volume and the following are referenced in Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Catalogue.It is the fastest method I know to find a review on common chemical reagents.It gives the history of a reagent with literature and relevant real world use of the reagent with exact conditions.It has excellent indexes:Suppliers, Index of Appratus, Index of reagents according to type, Author Index, Subject index, Buffers and acid bases.Volume 1 and 2 have many steroid reactions which were studied intensely in the 1950's and 1960's. All that is necessary to be successful is to have the liberty, courage and humility to try an old or new known reagent for a new substrate in a safe and pleasant environment. Also it helps to listen very carefully to the suggestions from those skilled in the art."
3,S'okay...,"One of the author's early novels before his writing matured. Heavily influenced by the late '60's era. I didn't feel like I wasted my time reading it, but I wouldn't recommend it as a great read."
4,Classic Darkover books,"Love landfall, two to conquer is a bit intense though, a bit dark, and the two dont really seem to have anything to do with each other since the time lines are so far apart. but, still, good books. i prefer landfall and if i'd known i would have just bought it seperately"
2,Three Part Review - Part 3,"Vicious Panties - Woman comes home to find here husband wearing her panties. She gets angry and decides to take it to extremes. Forced feminization basically. The biggest problem was the man's acting. Very flat! sounded like he was reading! Not my thing really, but the bad performance would have wrecked it if it was.Milky - In a nutshell it is a lactation and large penetration fantasy from a woman's POV. Voices are well done, generally pretty good but there is some flowery prose in it. Not bad though. Unfortunately, a couple of references to childbirth kind of jolt you out of the mood a little. Might be a guy thing :). Not bad over all.Kiss Me Kiss - 'Surrender to the Neo-Vagina' was the line that finally made my wife and I loose it completely. We couldn't stop laughing! This is bad ""erotic"" poetry set to bad music. I went looking for my black beret and cigarette holder! Skip it."
2,Not what we expected,"This CD is more stories being told, where as we were led to believe that it was more sensual audio. Although the stories are erotic, it reminds me of someone play acting a story that you could read in any forum."
2,Subtle? Not at all.,"The vignettes here are all as subtle as a hammer. If you like direct spoken voice, this may be for you. I found it lacking in any eroticism whatsoever."
2,Three part review - Part 1,"I too purchased this, or rather had it purchased for me for the '101 Grrreat Nights of Sex' book (which by the way is very fun!). I gave this 2 stars because although there is some good material on here (and very kinky), there is just too many weird, obscure, or plain not sexy tracks. It seems like the CD was trying to include a wide variety of tastes both erotic and artistic. The problem is that people who by it for the erotic value (which I believe is the largest market) are just going to shake their head at some of the ""artistic"" choices. Overall, there was no focus to the CD. It went from erotic to funny to irritating to bizarre. If you take just the erotic tracks, you end up with about five. Of those, each individual may find only 2 or 3 that appeal to them. 20 bucks for 2 or 3 good erotic tracks is a little too much. If your interest in this CD is other than erotic, maybe it is a better choice for you. As erotica, it isn't a lot of bang for your buck."

2,Poor Quality,"Either this is a factory second or the quality of plano tackle boxes has really gone down hill. We are very disapointed about the finish of this box. Yes it will still do its job I hope, but not what I expected from Plano."
2,Nice Product BUT......,"First of all, this is a very nice tackle box, it's quite large with loads of space to hold things. I bought this for beading supplies, not tackle gear and it's perfect for it.It arrived today, unfortunately two of the plastic cases are cracked and missing small pieces along the back. For the price I find that to be unacceptable."
4,Plano Box,The box worked well for what I needed. Fits everything with extra space. Using for my new e-cig rigs and equipment. Was a little slow on shipping
3,Tackle box works great BUT!!,When box came in it was missing storage trays did not return product only because I was replacing my old one that had same type trays but just be aware of this issue.
4,Plano 7771,Very cool tackle box-durable and able to hold plenty of gear. Waterproof and tight locks make it a great buy.
5,Plano 771,This box has a lot of room. I use it to store a game I have called Descent. I really like it.
4,Good value,"Ordered this as a gift for my fisherman husband. He really likes it. We'll see how it holds up under next summer's fishing. It is roomy and well organized. The plastic latches are a bit tricky, but hold fine."
2,Missing Pieces? Or is it....,"When looking at the photo's you see in one where you get 3 individual top plastic holders, and on the bottom you get 4 plastic drawers, and 1 plastic box that tucks in the side. Also according to some reviews this is what you get. But, if you read the fine print this is not what you get, and this is not what I got, my tackle box only came with 1 top plastic container, and had nothing inside of the bottom corner piece. When you read the small print it says you get 1-3500 storage piece and 4-3701 storage pieces, and nothing else. So I'm disappointed with this as I was expecting more. Aside from these misses pieces, the color of the box is more of a brown color, not the lighter grey you see in the pictures. Different color -1 star, two missing pieces -2 stars. I like to get what I intended to purchase, not a victim of bait and switch. Overall, I do love the box, and will put it to good use, and hopefully catch some nice fish, after I go buy some extra storage pieces ."
3,Good box. Cheap latches.,"This is a great portable storage device. It's sturdy and it will hold a lot of stuff. However, the latches are cheap. They are plastic and they are going to break. It's a fact. It's not if, but when. For a bunch of plastic at this price they could have sprung for metal latches. This will be a great product until one of the latches breaks. Then it will be garbage."
5,Replaced our Plano 777 with this one!,We needed a replacement for our Plano 777 and they no longer sell that model this is the closest one we could find to match it. We use this to hold our tools and supplies for an onsite business and it works perfectly. The only difference in the two different tackle boxes were the slide in drawers and they had a box in the larger compartment however that wasnt a problem for us we still had the other ones from the 777 and they all fit in perfectly. We use this daily for work and they last for years really nice product.
2,missing parts,"the bottom right storage box was missing. Otherwise the product is excellent, this is the 2nd one I have bought."
4,Herbs,"An old time herbalist tells all she's learned carried down from generation to generation. Includes herbal advise for just about any illness of which they are all listed (cancer to the common cold) with explanations of all the medicinal herbs and how to prepare them; drying, teas, tinctures (essences), juices, pulp, poultices, ointments and oils, compresses, and herbal baths. How to collect them and the back has great color plates so you can identify herbs. My very first book on herbs. Hard to understand for a beginning book, but a good one for anyone interested in herbs."
4,Lovely Story,"I really enjoyed this book, but there were a couple of things that were a little off. First of all, how can one woman have an almost suicide, an almost murder and a death all in one week!! I thought her daughter was just too good to be true. She was much nicer than any teenage girls I know. The constant discussion of wanting a cigarette got really tedious but thankfully eased towards the end. This book made me want to visit Taos. It sounds like a lovely place! I think Ms. Samuel is a terrific writer and I look forward to reading more from her."
2,I think tall the 5 star reviews are from friends.,"I bought this book on CD for my long commute to work. I thought with all the glowing 5 star reviews how could I miss. It starts off with Luna who about 20 rimes needs to smoke but she gave up smoking. She talks about her longing over and over. I guess if you are a smoker you can feel her pain, but I was nauseated. Then we have her daughter Joy who becomes perfect over night from a very troubled teen. Our heroine has sex right away with a crush. The only characters I liked were Maggie a young girl whose father had died and her Mother is clinically depressed. If you love New Mexico and its traditions this could be a book for you. I did love Kitty the Grandma, but the rest of the story is way over the top and becomes ridiculous."
1,Simply weak,"""In the heat of the night"" was a great film, but all the sequel did was make it look bad. It's a muder mystery with a father and son conflict which we don't care about, and it goes on too long."
4,Excellent Cast,"For 1970, this movie was very interesting, multiple issues for the time were displayed. A look into Virgil Tibbs personal life was an excellent touch, with a troubled son, a beautiful wife (Barbara McNair) and a demanding job, the performance by all was excellent. The cast included very talented actors. The plot was interesting, as it was a murder mystery, the movie included, suspense, romance, and some would say the scene with Virgil and his son was quite comical."
3,Interesting...Could Have Used More Character & Plot Development.,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This sequel to In The Heat Of The Night is an okay movie, which for some reason doesn't reference the first movie at all and has Virgil (once again played by Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier) working for a different police department than for the one he said he worked for in the first film. Martin Landau co-stars. The film could have used more character and plot development, particularly in the scenes involving Virgil's domestic life. I felt that it was a little too long, though to be fair, that is a reflection based on that I wasn't too interested in seeing the movie today (though I've been interested in it ever since I read about it years ago). Maybe another viewing will improve my initial opinion. The film will keep you guessing until the final 15-20 minutes. Disregard the R rating, and see it."
2,Should not be a PC Class,"I got this book because a player of mine wanted me to allow him to play a psionic character. After reading the book I know why he wanted to play one, they are very powerful, and throw off the game balance. This book should be a supliment for the DM for when he/she needs to know how to run a psionic monster or villian, not for the players. The only part of this book I would recomend allowing players to use would be the wild talent section."
3,"Well, it's better than the 1st Edition...","Psionics: The system TSR can't get right. The First Edition's psionics system was cryptic and confusing. The CPH version isn't a whole lot better, the power descriptions being on the whole vague and the systems being unnecessarily complex. There's also the problem of power.You see, the CPH makes a big deal about psionics not being magic. That's fine until you realize that most AD&D monsters with high magic resistance are completely vulnerable to psionics. Your nonpsionicist has only one defense against psionic attack -- stopping everything he's doing and concentrating. This makes high magic resistance, anti-magic shells, and the like a joke.Anyway, the CPH is like an early alpha release of an operating system -- it doesn't work very well. Maybe TSR can finally fix psionics in the Third Edition.Maybe not. What am I, a mind reader?"
5,Magic is a waste of time compared to psionics!,"Every fantasy RPG out there and half of the modern ones have magic in them, foks it's grown cliche. Psionics is a more believable system with better written and more down to earth powers. I won't play in a game that doesn't have psionics in it, nor will I run without it. This handbook is a great place to start if you haven't used psionics in your game yet, or if you're a player wanting to make your first psionic character. It's also worth noting that this is the only in print publication (that I know of) that has a concentration of psionic powers. A must have for anyone who wants to use psionics."
2,NO NUMBERS,I bought this book looking for an help to clarify me how to make choices about rigging and rigs .But for me there a not enough diagrams or tables .
4,Great accoustic and harmonies,Any Place at all with it's accoustic theme and fantastic harmonies delivers a sweet soothing experience that includeds some country. A great alternative to the hard aggresive music that you gear on the radio.
3,Not strictly non-fiction?,"While this short book has an interesting and personal story--as described in many earlier reviews here--it probably is more of a ""based on true events"" type of memoir.Many of the people and situations described in the book feel embellished or contrived. Also, a March 1999 New York Times article contains quotes from the author (she says she's a college graduate and runs an investment advice website, among other things) which don't match the book's narrative.All this is fine, as long as readers know not to approach Without a Net as literal truth. At the end of the day, the book is an interesting read but the author should have included a disclaimer to let readers know the story is semi-fictional (or selectively true) in places.Readers mainly interested in social criticism or descriptive accounts of homelessness won't be very satisfied by Without a Net. It is essentially an oral history with a finding-my-true-love story layered on top."
3,Captivating But Frustrating,"I agree with those who said that she was NOT really WITHOUT A NET. She refused to use whatever nets were available to her.I was completely drawn in by this book, and could not put it down. At a certain point, though, I was ready to SCREAM. I couldn't understand WHY she refused to explain the situation she was in to her parents, or to others at social welfare agencies. Her stubborness actually put her children in a lot of danger, and I don't agree with readers who say she was a ""caring mother.""I thought the book was trying to make a political point about our society, and about the fact that you could end up ""middle class and homeless in America."" But all this book really proved to me was that, yes, that's possible if you make enough bad choices and are then incredibly stubborn about getting help. This book could be used to provide support for Republican arguments that people who end up homeless have brought it on themselves!!! I don't think that was the author's intention."
4,High quality playing and refreshingly straight singing,"The musicians on this disk play jazz of a high quality. Rebecca Martin sings as the songs require without unnecessary addition. She is a song lovers singer, who has an affecting vulnerable quality in her voice at times. Her singing of 'The Folks Who Live on the Hill' could hardly be be better."
2,Not what I was looking for,Too much Choir for me. Was looking for simple version of Wanderlieder to teach and sing along.
4,Is this book for you?,"This is a good book, but before buying it, check that you are in the target audience. It is not a reference book. It is not for complete newbies. It is not for gurus, either.It is more like a hands-on CSS training course for somebody who has used HTML a lot, knows a little bit about CSS, and who wants to make fuller use of CSS. If this is what you are looking for, this is an excellent book. It is well-produced, with appropriate and intelligent use of color screenshots, too.You will need to use some kind of reference in addition to this book when you actually write CSS for your own sites."
5,Practical and Clear,"As someone who understands a great deal about web design, I am usually very critical of books I read. In general, they either lack the detailed examples or the plain language that I prefer to find when I read them. However, Eric Meyer has done an excellent job in providing both. The book is broken down into projects where you are taught how to apply CSS to everything from skinning a menu to creating an online greeting card. I have always had a rather basic knowledge of CSS and let my WYSIWYG editor do most of the work, but now I have a powerful tool to do some advanced, custom work. I recommend this book to the beginner as well as the advanced designer."
3,Expected more,"After all that I've read about Eric Meyer, I must admit I was left wanting after reading this book. The experience reminded me of certain teachers I had in college: very bright, knew what they were doing, but did not know how to effectively convey their knowledge to others. For instance, his erratic use of varying units of measure within the same CSS rule - usually without explanation - goes against most all professional design convention, making the resulting code both difficult to learn AND difficult to maintain (VERY confusing for subsequent Web technicians needing to modify the work).Buy the book - but buy it USED."
5,Best improvement of my skills this year,"I have used alittle CSS on my pages before, but Eric shows how to take full advantage and explains the benefits of implementing more CSS styles than I have ever thought possible. I have cut the amount of code on the pages by at least 20% and at the same time added more style and control to the pages.I started using some of his styles within a week of picking up the book. I was stuck in one area, I down loaded the lessons. It is the easiest way to see how the code effects the pages and what changes and additions I needed to make. I can't say enough about how easy the styles and the code are to follow with the down loaded pages."
2,Masterubg tge kabgyage of Web Design,The book is basically a cookbook on converting an existing table based web-site to a combo table/CSS format. After going through the first few chapter I realized a person would not learn much from this book. There is much better books on CSS on the market. Avoid this one.
2,A OK book for experienced people,"Being in the IT industry, mostly web based, I thought I would give this book a try to see what new material I could learn and apply in my job. Anyway, it was a disappointment. The book doesn't really explain anything but walks you through on changing from a non CSS site to one. It's not that good for what CSS is capable of doing either and the options associated with it. Overall, this book really isn't any good for someone that has experience. To me, it's more of a beginner to intermediate level for those who have only scratched the surface of CSS. If your experienced, don't bother."
2,Good for starters,"I have found better books out there, but this one is okay. Good to get you started."
2,Design for the 10 %,"Over 90% of the browsers surfing the internet are using IE, but this book's examples seem to only work best on Netscape browsers. Although the author suggested many hacks for both IE and Netscape, i.e. the voice-family in page 241 for the right margin hacks on Windows IE. It still doesn't work on Windows XP Pro IE6 sp1. The design concept is great though."
3,Good to begin with CSS but a little obsolete.,"This book is good to practice CSS. To be used before the Meyer's second one (""More Eric Meyer On CSS""). On the other hand, because it was written in 2002, it is a little obsolete for some techniques. The using of the 'table' tag for layout is still here. This is not the case in the second book which use the positionning... and sorry for my english !!!"
4,Good CSS,"I marvel any author these days who can produce a pratical and readable book on software. Eric does a good job at making us want to read and learn the gems in CSS. I like it because the examples are relevant and you can see how you can apply them. This book is more a learning by doing book then many others that I have read on the same subject. Eric will not bore you with explanations, but instead uses examples to demonstrate the fine points. Good book to have."
3,Good writing but not enough book,"Eric's writing is great, however, for a thin book with limited content, my opinion is that New Riders Publishing got greedy with the pricing of the book. $45 retail in the stores?! For the price I expected a book with more meat, more content as opposed to a few tips and tricks. For the price, New Riders could have at least included a disk with all the samples that you are required to download online if you wish to work along as the book is intended. In the book, what Eric has done is to show a few CSS tips and cool tricks, his writing style is very good and his tips are great, however, there isn't enough of it in this book. Don't buy it new, or at least not in the retail stores, it isn't worth the price.If this is a must have book for you, buy it at Amazon's online price, used, or somewhere such as nerdbooks.com and avoid the FULL $45 retail price such as charged by places like Books-a-Million!!"
4,Great book!,"Good hands on experience...need more reference, but that's why I should get another book. If you are looking for real world examples and projects, this is a great tool."
4,"Good for those who want to learn ""hands on""","Anyone who knows the name Eric Meyer knows that he is a diety in the CSS world. This book takes a look at a few step-by-step projects that will help newbies understand how, when, and why to use CSS.That said, I do not recommend this book to those who are already well versed in CSS. I really didn't get a lot out of it, but I would consider myself a more advanced reader. I can definitely see the benefit for people just getting their feet wet."
5,It's a Keeper,"I read the reviews before buying this book and ""More Eric.."", but like a fool I didn't take the time to read the books when they showed up because I was so hopping busy learning html and putting sites together that I just didn't have the time....But you gotta get these books! Because when you finally sit down to read the first 3 pages of the first book you start seeing repetitive html code disappearing by the TRUCKLOAD. Font tags: your days are numbered. Tables, < br >, -- whooosh, see ya.And the power of CSS is so totally awesome that you just want to stay up late at night re-doing all the 30 plus sites you finished without CSS and now you want to write Eric and ask him to include caffeine addiction tips in his next dispatch because you can't believe you've got so much power in CSS and, well, thanks, Eric, for making life grand again."
2,"It's good, but you can do without","How can I say this simply? CSS, you can pick up by really (really) looking at other people's code and then doing it yourself (translate: open notepad and put in stuff like #box{margin:0 auto;width:466px;border:1px solid #555} then save as style.css not style.txt. You then open notepad again to create the html file, one that imports the style.css file. If you don't know how to do this, then just stop reading and get this book.) There wasn't anything in this book that I could not have picked up on my own, via reading other people's CSS files. Save your money, get Meyer's 2nd book instead (ISBN 0735714258), which explains some things you can't get by reading code alone."
5,Lords of the levee,Wonderful book on early Chicago politics. To understand the corruption of Chicago it's important to know how it started. Big Bill Thompson and Governor Len Small learned how be be thieves from Hinkey Dink & Bathhouse. A great read.
5,An engaging and diverse anthology of forefront scholarship.,"The fourth edition of Kimmel and Messner's Men's Lives is an engaging anthology accessing the forefront of scholarship about diverse men and masculinities. Going beyond earlier texts and collections, Men's Lives now reflects the development of greater theoretical sophistication and coherence in a field once often represented as anecdote and generalization. It is not simply ""good men's studies,"" it is good gender studies. An instructor's resource manual is available and provides relevant summaries, experiential learning exercises, and examination questions, plus key terms, films, and internet resources."
5,Happy Customer :),Received on time and as described. I am very happy with my purchase!! It is exactly what I needed...Product was in great condition!
2,hmm,"Kimmel and Messner are acomplished researchers, yet I find no reason for the ""cute"" little additions such as average male size charts and sarcastic quizes revolving around the ""gay or straight"" issues. We are saturated with sexuality in our day and age, we don't need it from our scholars as well."
1,"Michael Kimmel is a pro-feminist , therefore has feminist agenda, don't trust his books","I have stumbled upon one of Michael Kimmel's articles regarding men's behaviors. I emailed him and asked some hard questions regarding his feministic attitudes. He could not answer any of my questions. For example, I asked him why he is so focusd on ""correcting"" men's behaviors when society and feminists and many women today view men as doofus, murderers, rapists, etc, as evidence by movies, commericals, TVs... Basically men are not respected while at the same time, women only programs are popping up all the time! Furthermore, I commented that in order to finetune men's ""bad behaviors"", one must also addresses women's attitudes toward men! He failed to answer and only ask me to be openminded and attend one of the women's courses and called me angry!"
4,The definitve book on public relations,"This book is two books put into one. The first half is the history of public relations as Bernays saw it, and the second half is the application. This book was pretty much the first of its kind and introduced a lot of the philosophies that are still used today. That makes it an important study for anyone interested in campaigning or brand management."
2,Pretentious piffle,The unwary may be drawn to this piece of cinematic dreck by the presence of two actors of talent-Stacy Keach and Billy Dee Williams .They should take note that neither has much more than a cameo role and the bulk of the action is dominated by a youthful cast of spectacular ineptitude.It is at bottom a conventional teens in peril tale with the group in question being menaced by sasquatch while on a field trip .Or are thay ?A framing device suggests it may all be taking place in the mind of the central character Carrie who may or may not be possessed of a vivid imagination and severe sexual repressionConfused and confusing with frenetic camera movement substituting for directorial imagination.Avoid.
1,"Cheap thriller fails to thrill, only confuses.","The repressed sexual terror of a young woman physically manifests itself and begins to stalk her and her friends. It also turns said friends into monsters. A sadistic therapist tries to help the young woman break out of her freudian shell. Too bad the movie makes the viewer work so hard to figure this out and, in the end, offers no answers for all its 'disturbing' imagery and events, the narrative is simply an endless mobius strip of symbolic events with no rhyme or reason to it. A journey not worth taking. Stacey Keach and Billy Dee Williams should fire their agents for getting them cast in this glorified student film."
2,This movie will not provide much fear for the viewers,Fear Runs Silent is one of those direct to video rentals and it shows. The plot revolves around a group of students that agree to go out in the woods to a cabin with their teacher where they are suppossed to face their fears. The gore level was not very high and the acting was very ameturish. It probably could have been scary with a bigger budget and some better acting. As for the dvd extras not much at all. You have your basic play movie and scene selections. The picture was ok for a pretty low budget movie but the sound was not too high and didnt match the soundtrack. Overall I'd say skip this. If your looking for a movie that will scare you look elsewhere.
3,FRS has one of the most SHOCKING ENDINGS IN MOVIE HISTORY!!!,Horror fans will diappointed with this because when things happen you don`t know if it really did or if it was a dream or a flashback.Ofcourse it can be scary at times and at times it can get really scary but seeing the same clip of the monster(s) about 10 times can really be annoying but I laughed alot at it so if you like error movies this is something to see but I warn you if you see and buy Fear Runs Silent be prepared for a shocking ending that you`ll never forget!
2,Smells terrible,"Thankfully I read the reviews on Amazon about how big this unit was...it's huge! The sound reception from radio seems fine (I live in big city though, so usually it's easy to get radio stations). One very big downside is that this machine is off-gassing a LOT. The smell is chemical / lacquer smell every time I turn it on and it warms up. It's so bad that I have to leave the window open.I called the company and they said it should go away but to return it before 90-days is up in case it does not. Seems a bit tricky business to me...but perhaps not. I've had it for 2-weeks now and it still smells very, very strongly."
4,drill bits,Ive got so many drill bits I can't even keep em straight. I don't think I've used these ones yet but I will say there's nothing wrong with cheap drill bits. They all come from China anyway.
1,French only...,"If you speak French then purchase this DVD, if not you will be disappointed as I was that there are no English subtitles."
5,Camille Claudel - a must see,"The story of Camille Claudel is a 'must see' for anyone interested in the role of women in the 19th century who are up against the power and status of men - matters still relevant in the 21st century - despite feminism. This movie is about family and personal relationships, patriarchial systems, how women were once labelled mentally ill (or driven to it) through the pursuit of exploring and demonstrating their creativity, talent and genius. After watching this movie the memory of Camille Claudel,her work and courage lives on and is much respected."
1,WARNING: DVD IS CUT BY 13 MINUTES!,"This USA butchered DVD release has 13 minutes cut from it, excluding major plot points, whole sequences, violence, nudity and characters. This is NOT a review of the film, merely this substandard, shoddy MGM release. The UNCUT version on DVD is available in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, basically everywhere in the world but here!"
1,Beware of buying used DVD,Just don't buy a used DVD. I just received mine and could only watch 1/3 of the movie before it began to stick!!! :(I loved the first part only wish I could finish the movie.
2,Camille Claudel,Movie has English subtitles. Well acted with good scenery but the life of Camille Claudel is essentially a depressing one and the movie portrays this fairly accurately.
1,Unpleasant,"Camille is supposed to be a talented, passionate sculptor but she is content to just try to become the mistress of Rodin, a serial seducer. She becomes his assistant, model, and lover, not producing any significant sculpture of her own. Surprisingly she did not know that unprotected sex with a married man can lead to no good.After he refuses to give up his wife for her, she exhibits her sculptures on her own, with no success. She blames Rodin and his ""gang"" for her failure. According to the movie, she just did not have what it took to be successful on her own.The movie seems to adhere faithfully to the historical facts as reported in the Wikipedia, but it adds up to a very unpleasant experience whose point escapes me.One positive thing about the movie is the seeming historical authenticity of the settings (turn-of-century France)."
1,I don't know,OMG I got a VHS. It didn't say that when I bought so I haven't played it yet to see quality.
2,"Decent content, poorly presented","I thought the book had a good deal of useful information, especially on the details of the Valsalva manuever and the breathing process. I was distracted, however, by the outdated inkjet pictures, and the supposedly ""breakthrough"" discoveries and teaching techniques which have been around for quite some time in the professional circuit. The book is good for the student who is new to the study of breathing, but does not contain any bibliography for further study. Arnold Jacobs, former tuba player with the Chicago Symphony (and widely known for his expertise on breathing for musical purposes) has much more information to provide, and most of his discoveries were made many years ago, and still apply today. If you purchase this book, be sure to check out anything by Jacobs or his former students to see what you'll be missing."
4,Good but not GREAT,"After I heaard the CD, what I really wanted was a craving for more songs. Too bad there werent any more songs."
4,Good CD,"I got this CD for Christmas a few years back and, being a die-hard Star Wars fan, I really would have liked the bigger version. But John Williams is THE composer of the 20th century and here is no exception. There are classics such as ""Imperial March"" and the ""Star Wars theme"" buy it!"
4,"This isn't a [SOUNDTRACK], but is a very good rendition.","All of the music on this album is the motion pictures SCORE, but isn't the motion picture SOUNDTRACK performed by the London Symphony Orchestra for the actual motion picture. Mentioning SOUNDTRACK in your description of this album, even when you also refer to it elsewhere as from the motion picture SCORE, is confusing and misleading. Nevertheless,it is a fairly faithful reproduction of the original score."
3,Song selection questionable,"This score of the classic trilogy's music is a passable overview of some outstanding music. Although the amazing Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme) is included, I am left wondering why Luke Skywalker's and Ben's themes were not. The bottom line is that this is an ok choice if you don't want to spend nearly $100 for the 3 movie soundtracks. However, I now plan on buying the soundtracks for the prequels as they are released, rather than just a summary."
4,"Good, but missing something","This CD is very good, with the best of Episodes IV, V, & VI, but it is missing some of the essential songs from each of the movies. I have this along with the full versions for each movie, and I suggest you get those. This CD just doesn't do justice to all the music of Star Wars. Don't take me wrong, it is a very good CD but it lacks some of my favorite songs. If you want one good CD, get this, otherwise get the full soundtracks."
5,Amazing Hunting Horns Way Off Key but Fun,This is a great record. Beautifully recorded (like most Erato CDs) but you've never heard anything quite like the Hunting Horn Suites! I cringed and laughted at first but had to listen again and again. It's actually quite beautiful. It must have been quite an effort for all players to hit the same wrong notes at once using just embouchure! A very special disc (in a weird kind of way).
4,"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews ""Grounded""",This is a short book but a good telling of the tale of the downfall of Eastern Airlines under the managment of Frank Lorenzo. It is also a story that relates a great deal about the corporate attitudes of the late 1980s and the potential consequences of that attitude.The only shortcoming of the book is that the story line leaves off with the ejecetion of Frank Lorenzo as the debor in possession of the bankrupt airline and the appointment of a bankrupcy trustee in April of 1990. The airline did continue operation until sometime later in 1990 when the company was finally liquidated. The story stopped too soon.
4,Bewildering and Suspenseful,"I read the original publication in the early 90's. This book reads well and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story is bewildering and illustrates a classic ""old world"" perspective of labor/management relations clashing with the modern realities of a deregulated airline market that would no longer tolerate labor friction."
3,Good Review but ends to early,"Overall this book gives an sufficent explantian on the events that led up to Eastern's Shutdown. However, it is bias toward the unions without exposing there arrogance. If you ignore this fact and simply rely on the facts given this is a fairly good book. And also, it ends before the shutdown of the company in January 1991. It does not show the final stage of the Eastern Airlines saga between where Frank Lorenzo loses power and the company shutsdown. 3 stars."
3,Pam Grier is the reason I saw this film,Pam Grier is very sexy as Foxy Brown but overall the movie is a stinker.That's all I got to say other then the plot stinks and that Pam is the only reason I give this flick 3 stars. It's pretty much a revenge movie that's it and it's a very dumb one too(no offense)By the way sadly they are remaking this film and is set to come out 05 and rumors say that Hallie Barry will play as Foxy..oh poop..3 stars..
2,"Less Enjoyable Than ""Coffy""","What seemed to have worked so well in ""Coffy"" just doesn't here. Yes, we get to see Pam Grier, and she's fine, but the script just doesn't give her a whole lot to do. Furthermore, the villain in this one just isn't scary, with her overwrought lines and lame ""I'm in charge"" banter; the sleazeball from ""Coffy"" was better because we didn't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end. That tension is missing here, save for one scene where Grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way. We actually get to feel a little tension.However, I still feel that this below-average ""follow-up"" is more than a little disappointing, especially since ""Coffy"" really set a high bar, with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists. See this only if you just need to watch another Grier vehicle because it's just not as good."
2,I love her... but!,"Best thing about this movie is when Pam Grier takes off her shirt... if you want Blaxploitation classics try ""Superfly"", ""Shaft"" or Pam's own ""Coffy"" - all way blacker n' way mo better!And yes, I do love her butt, too."
4,"Jackie Brown, Part I","Younger viewers who enjoyed 1997'sJackie Brownmay not realize that Pam Grier starred in several blacksploitation films in the early 1970s, including the eponymous Foxy Brown. This 1974 AIP film offers better production values than others from the same stable.Musicand costumes are dynamite. Even the camerawork is good, the editing less disjointed than in some films of this era. And it's not without humor, either; the double entendres with the two hookers and the judge were LOL hilarious, plus the time Foxy hides a gun in her 'fro.Grier holds her own against predominantly male leads in this genre--the pickle-jar emasculation of a tough guy here is notable, as is Foxy's rape by rednecks--thus making this essentially a sexploitation film, too. It must be said, however: Tarantino's homage is a much better film, and furthermore, the actress improved with age. So enjoy the best of both worlds and watch 'em as a double feature. Brown is indeed ""a whole lotta woman""!Genre rating: 4 stars"
4,"Good, but not as good as Coffey","Pam looks awesome in this flick, but there is more nudity in Coffey. This flick has great scenes, like how she escapes from the 'ranch'. Watching her tongue stretch to the max to pick up the razor blade is enough to make me want to watch this film twice. Like in Coffey she has to play a call girl to get 'in'. However she looked better as 'Mystique' in Coffey than 'Silky Cotton' in Foxy Brown.The 70's fashion and lingo is all here though. If you are a Pam Grier fan, this is a must. Rock solid and dynamite brother."
4,Great Pulp!!,"Great DVD. Beautiful, widescreen picture and a fun story. You don't measure a movie like this by ""Citizen Kane"" standards; you measure it by Joe Bob drive-in standards; and by that measure, ""Foxy Brown"" makes the grade. You get Foxy bullwhipped around the neck and dragged; you get the riot scene in the ... bar; you get the judge humiliated by call girls before the ladies auxiliary; you get Foxy shooting her two-timing, dope-selling brother in the ear. Oh, it gets better, but you'll have to see the movie to find out how."
3,Deceiving!,"i thought i was gonna see the famous philipino female rapper! all i got was a lousy movie with bad acting and slow unrehearsed fight scenes. no story what so ever. terrible at best! i would recommend the movie ""lil' kim"". much better ""props"" and good behind the scenes bonuses."
2,"I LOVE PAM, BUT......","Once again, a TERRIBLE DVD!! The movie is A CLASSIC, and like the 'Coffy' DVD, you don't get your money's worth.You DO get 'MONO SOUND' with this DVD, and I was hoping for a 'surround sound' experience when I bought this disc.If I were you, I would AVOID ALL OF THESE 'SOUL CINEMA' DVDS, because they don't give you a full 5.1 Digital transfer, or any 'DVD Bonus Features lke interviews, etc.Save your money, and either buy the VHS tape, or wait for better DVDS.I gave this DVD 2 stars just because Pam was involved, otherwise it would get 1 star!!!"
3,cool-ish,Not bad 70's time capsule.Not quite as enjoyable as it should be though as it tends to drag quite a bit in places.15 minutes or so cut from it would have probably made it a sharper film.Needless to say the hairstyles and the wardrobe are hilarious.As is some of the dialogue.Worth a look.
2,She's Foxy.. but the movie stinks..,"I snuck into a theatre to see this movie when it came out.. so when I saw it for sale..I thought I had to have it.. Upon further review.. this is simply is an awful movie! The limited times that Pam takes off her shirt almost makes it worth the price.. but not really. There were good movies made in this time period, but this is not one of them. What a shame that Pam's talents were wasted on this blaxpoitation crap.. she should have been a huge star."
2,Disappointing......,"Jack Hill's Foxy Brown isn't a sly piece of filmmaking. Hill's cartoonish screenplay gives Pam Grier nothing to work with in this cheesy revenge yarn that's more about skin instead of substance. She wants revenge for the murder of her boyfriend by the syndicate and will do anything to get the satisfaction of retribution. Almost every one of the paper-thin characters is just there for her to kill, maim, or injure. The film goes from campy to downright silly when a henchman gets ground up by an airplane propeller and the absurdity reaches a climax when Foxy pulls a pistol out of her Afro. Ugh! To see Pam do this right, get Coffy or the far superior Jackie Brown. And avoid the Halle Berry remake coming up. That's going to be a funky piece of Gorgonzola too."
5,Excellent for toddlers!,"I am a bilingual storyteller and was introduced to this book through my job. The illustrations are good, portraying a young boy as he goes on a walk and all the animals he comes across. The children I've read this book to love to guess what animal they will be seeing next by using the pictures. I would recommend this book to parents with small children. You can do so much with it!"
5,A beautiful book and fine resource for yoga students,"I received this beautiful book as a Christmas gift, and it was a wonderful surprise. I've been doing yoga for about a year and a half, and I think this book will be a very helpful and handy resource. It contains a brief history of yoga, descriptions of the various types of yoga, an illustrated guide to all of the most common poses, advice for students and aspiring students, advice on diet, advice on sequencing poses and lists of additional resources. To top it off, this is a beautifully designed book with very attractive photography. This book would be a fine gift or investment for any yoga student."
5,Concise and Complete,"This book was a very welcome discovery. So many of the books on Access are either endless tomes full of high-end programming that I'll never need for my business, or else they're those quick little guides that look like they cover it all but don't actually tell you how to >do< anything.This was exactly what I was looking for. Its got examples that are relevant to me as a business owner and I've given it to a friend who is an exec for a big insurance company (think ""pyramid"") and he said its addressing his needs, too. It's written clearly, but it's also an enjoyable read. So many computer books are so dry. I was able to get down to business immediately after reading this, and my Access databases are up and running great. Highly recommended!"
4,Very much to the point,"I usually develop custom applications against Oracle. But for one project, I needed to make Access front-end Oracle in order to support ad hoc queries. After playing with Access for a day, it was apparent some functionality was not easy to get my hands on. I was confronted with a few ""how do I get from here to there"" situations. This book clearly and concisely explained how to implement some common business processes. While I have a technical background, the Access user interface is decidedly non-technical and not always intuitive. This helped me in a couple of key areas. It was much easier to use than most of those dreadful 1,200 page tomes. And it covered things I couldn't find online. For me, it was definitely useful."
4,Slinky Intercontinental,"This is the second best Slinky compilation, next to the original. The first disc has alot of energy. The second disc is more ambient and emotional. The Sister Bliss remix on this album is incredible, but remeber, it always takes a couple of listens to really hear what I am talking about"
4,Excellent CD!,"Highly recommend CD2. Some of the best deep house I have heard thus far. If you're not into the cheesy techno, this is the best Slinky in the collection."
2,"Sometimes engaging, sometimes confusing. An uneven book.","There were moments in which I really enjoyed this book, but often I was thrown out of my state of disbelief bylittle thing like the phrasing of dialogue, the changing sense of continuity between thepast and the ""present,"" or the ferocity of the lust between the main characters (or their counterparts).There was just enough eerieness to keep the mind engaged in the paranormal mystery, but somehow it neverdeveloped into a seamless whole.An air book in places, but hardly a keeper."
3,Difficult Read,I've read many books by this author and have enjoyed most of them. This book was enjoyable but it also dragged out much longer than it should have. There were two stories incorporated into one and this was not always done smoothly. Cute idea and shows much imagination.
2,I Love Catherine Coulter..But....,"This book just dosn't desearve her name on the cover.As usuall Ms. Coulter give's us funny dialoge and steamy love sceans between our hero and heroine. I thought the beginning was wonderfull, unique, interesting. But toward the middle the book started to fall apart. The reader finds him/herself time hopping from era to era. And at first, you have no clue whats going on. It almost seems like two different short books glued together at this point in the story!! Even Stephen King readers would find it hard to follow along Ms. Coulter's wrighting style in this one.I give this book two stars..one star goes to the begining of the book which was suburband one star goes to the end of the book which was kinda cool, because Merryn and Bishop find a trinket that belonged to the great wizzard Merlyn....."
1,Does Anne also suffer from the curse?,"As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to. I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.I feel like I wasted money. I feel robbed."
1,This book is a curse,"This is a first (and last) Catherine Coulter book I've read, or at least tried to read. What started out with great potential very quickly became a confusing, error-ridden mess. The only question I have is did this book not have to pass through editing? It is simply a mess, just a bunch of words on paper bounded together to impersonate a book. Shame on the publisher!"
2,Just skip it,"Please just don't bother with this Catherine Coulter novel. It had major potential - a mystical/creative/unusual plot concept, but the extremely disjointed narrative and the ending leave you unfulfilled and frustrated. Basically, there are two stories here, one in the ""present"" time and one even further in the past. Unfortunately, neither story feels complete and Ms.Coulter is unable to weave these two complicated stories together in any coherent fashion, so you find yourself wondering what exactly is going on in practically every chapter. I say skip it and go with one of CC's much better novels (Impulse/Edge/almost anything!)."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This author has definitely written better books than this one. I was dissappointed with this novel, it goes on and on over the same thing, a romance between a witch and a wizard, and it was boring. The plot is totally confusing, with many irrelevant things, and of course, totally predictable: you know both couples will end together, no surprise there. I read it to the end because I always finish the books I start reading, but it was not worth the effort nor the money I spent on it."
4,THE PENWYTH CURSE,"I LOVED THE PENWYTH CURSE. IT WAS MY FIRST CATHERINE COULTER BOOK AND FOR THAT MATTER A FIRST IN HISTORICAL ROMANCE. IT CAPTIVATED ME FROM THE START. I LIKED ALL THE CHARACTERS AND ENJOYED THE ""OTHER TIME"" WITH THE WITCH A THE WIZARD AND THEIR STORY. I THOUGHT IT WAS WELL PACED WITH ANSWERS TO THE MYSTERY OF THE CURSE AT THE END."
1,The Penwyth Curse,"I usually love Catherine Coulter's work, but this was unsatisfactory. I did'nt even finish it. I got to CD #7 and gave up. Too many witches and wizards for me. And the plot was hard to follow. I donated it to my local library. Maybe someone will enjoy it."
3,Ho hum....,"I must say, I always look forward to Coulter's books. I scooped up this book with high hopes. Needless to say, I barely could make myself finish the book.I had no sympathy or liking for any of the characters and the plotline was just too confusing...jumping back through time to wizards and the like. Coulter needs to stay with formulas like the one she used for ""The Sherbrooke Bride"". Now, that was a good book!!"
1,Just plain bad...,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I don't think I will bother with any of her other books. I picked it up as a frequent reader of historical fiction, but I like most any book set in England during the middle ages. The dialogue was repetitive and contrived, and the characters were flat. I did finish the book just to see how creative the conclusion to the mystery was handled. Unfortunately, not very well. Many questions were left unanswered. It almost seems as though the author just keeps repeating and obsessing on the aspects of the story she has worked out, while trying to think up a satisfying ending. If the subject matter and appeals to you, try Michael Criton's ""Timeline"" or Connie Wells' ""Doomsday Book."""
1,What a disappointment!,I love Catherine Coulter. Her books have always been a joy to read. This book does not reflect the Catherine Coulter I know. The story line and the characters were boring. It is obvious that the time was not taken to develop this story the way it should have been. Catherine Coulter and other romance writers have started focusing more on writing suspense books while still trying to write romance. If this is what romance readers get in the bargain then please leave the romance writing to those who will put the time and effort into giving us great stories with great characters.
1,Probably the worst book I've ever read!,"Reading The Penwyth Curse, you almost believe there are two different writers at work - one moment you're reading fairly interesting dialogue and descriptions, and the next minute you read ""it would be a very bad thing"", and the words ""simply"" and ""just"" repeated dozens of times throughout the book! The worst? ""she was so afraid she almost puked from it"" Oh, puhleez!It had potential, but ""just"" didn't succeed. ""Simply"" didn't."
1,Tip #51: Dont buy this book,"I cant believe I bought this. It is completely outdated and has no real information. The book basically gives you 50 tips to improve your productivity. However, the tips are so basic that even an 18 year old intern could figure them out on the first week. Worthless information."
2,A Glaze of Color: Creating Color and Design on Ceramicsed,"This was a really disappointing purchase. There may have been some good techniques embedded somewhere, but I was so put off by the sloppy and amateurish work shown that I just couldn't bring myself to give it a thorough read.I couldn't tell who was the intended audience. It was too confusing for the beginner, and nothing new or exciting for the more advanced. Lots of important information was left out. For instance, how many coats of glaze were used? The book seemed mostly for the ""paint bar"" crowd rather than the serious potter."
5,A hillarious look at the problem of good vs. evil,"If there really is a Devil somewhere in the universe, I'm sure he closely resembles Bulgakov's Woland (along with his infamous band of sidekicks). Overall, a brilliantly funny, inventive, and poignent novel! Read it for the laughs, sublime social commentary, and historical and religious insights that you will glean from its memorable storyline."
3,It's like Dosteovsky on acid,"This the most bizarre book I've read in a long time--maybe ever. It is also an amazing story, or stories told in a fun and entertaining way. This is a must read for fans of Russian literature. I have to confess that I was not able to pick up many of the allusions to Soviet Russia. That's probably not something you'd get unless you read this in Russian and had a good understanding of Bulgakov's period. Bulgakov also weaves Christians themes in the novel, mainly through a storyline about Pontius Pilate. However, this storyline is completely unlike the Biblical account. It is unclear what theological points Bulgakov was making if any. Regardless, it is an entertaining book which will stimulate your imagination. 3.5 stars"
4,"""I'm not afraid because I've already been through everything.""","Only a writer as skilled as Bulgakov could pull off a story that interweaves the crucifixion of Jesus into a Faustian tale featuring the devil. But The Master and Margarita is so much more than the typical good versus evil novel. It's also an eye-opening social and political commentary, one that's so scathingly obvious that it didn't see the light of day until forty years after Bulgakov's death. The deep themes and hidden undertones are everywhere, but you don't need a Ph.D. in literature or a Master's degree in Russian history to enjoy this book. Although a little slow-going at first, the action quickly picks up in part two and the chapters leading up to Satan's ball will have you breathlessly ripping through the pages. The dark and bitter cold Moscow provides a fitting backdrop for this well-deserving classic."
5,The best book.,"This is my favorite book. I'm not sure it's a good translation, so if you know Russian you have to read it in Russian."
5,Perfect translation gives a real taste of the perfect book,"Even if you already have read ""Master and Margarita"" read it again in this new translation! It is worth it because it's superior. The flawless work by D.Burgin and K.O'Connor gives to American readers a rare opportunity to taste one of the greatest entrees of Russian literary cuisine genuine and fresh.The three-day adventures of The Prince of Evil in the capital of the world's atheism prove that human nature remains human nature - communism or not. The delicate interplay of three breath-taking simultaneous plots, the romance, the thrill and a lot of fun!"
5,Mind boggling,"I asked a friend from St. Petersburg what I should read after the War and Peace translation (P&V) I just finished. He suggested this. It makes W&P look like a comic book. This book is taking me longer to read (I'm slow), and I feel the urge to buy the commentary, which will really slow me down. If you read this book you will think you are going insane!"
2,"2 stars for translation, not the book","I admire this book and always wondered how it might have been translated into English. I reviewed several editions and versions, and found this one is a bit harsh in translation style, and not quite exact. I would recommend the edition from Penguin Classics, translation done by Richard Pevear; or the edition translated by Mirra Ginsburg."
5,Simply enchanting,There are a lot of great reviews for this book already. So I will only repeat after them that this is a must read for every person capable of thinking.This book is not really about satire on Stalin's Russia - it could have been written about any historical period of pretty much any country. This book is about how people's nature doesn't really change and how love is the most redeeming thing in the world.
5,Classic Genius,"Unclassifiable novel that breaks all the conventions and succeeds. I won't waste time explaining the plot or storyline, just buy it and read it. Subtle political statement (or understatement) permeates this novel but where it departs and excels is in it's weirdness. It is certainly the most bizarre and entertaining novel I have ever read. The Dinner Ball with Satan is a real highlight."
4,unique read,"I had some doubts when I first started this book. I thought this was probabaly another surpressed novelist who tried to let out his frustration to the communist regime. Well, turns out I am not completely wrong, however this book is definately in the legue of its own, not just ""another"" russian novel. Bulgakov has a talent to lure his readers into his kingdom of vivid imaginations by hypnotizing them with his lively writing style.I especially enjoyed his great depictions about Jesus and Potinus Pilate. In the beginning of the book Woland once mentioned that he was on the balcony with Potinus Pilate when he sentenced Juses to crucification, the way Bulgakov wrote thes chapeters impress me as if he had been there by himself! Although I am not to crazy about the protagonists Master and Magarita, who in my opinion show less character than Woland and his mischievous entourage. Long story short, great book, highly recommend!"
5,One of the Best books in history.,"This masterpiece, has always been a favorite of mine, for its beautiful writing, hilarious characters, Faustian theme with a romantic twist, and satire.This particular edition with its annotations, added to the reading experience. I read the annotations, chapter by chapter, which describes the political background, references that only would make sense in Russian, to people who knew the times.Even if you have read it before, the annotations alone make it worth reading again."
2,Second Rate,"This highly acclaimed novel doesn't deserve its reputation. As Russian literature in translation it is vastly inferior to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and even Solzhenitsyn. As magic realism, it lacks the imaginative genius of Borges. As satire on the Communist regime, it pales before Orwell. In depiction of life under Communism, Koestler and Solzhenitsyn surpass it in detail and impact. As fantasy, the plot devices are banal and have been utilized to better effect by many other writers. The translation is sluggish and plodding where it tries to be poetic. The characters are annoying and lack depth. Two stars for a fairly intriguing take on Christ's trial and execution (about 60 pages in the 402 page edition I read)."
2,blood and guts,"About midway through this book, I decided it could easily be turned into a screenplay for another run-of-the-mill slasher movie. Maybe the best is yet to come, but I resent having read so far waiting for something better."
1,"I know, I know","There are 245 reviews of this book and 206 are five star and only 5 are one star. But I will say that this book, tho it is written (or translated) so that it is easy to read, yet, tho I tried to penetrate at least one of ""many tiers"" of significance which it is said to have, I could not find any significance of interest to me. If one is into fantasy I suppose one could get caught up in the senseless and impossible things which occur all thru the book, but it all seemed dull and stupid to me. I have looked at the impressive web sites dealing with the book and obviously some are quite taken by the book. I was so glad when I reached the last page!"
1,"Nearly incomprehensible: this was hard work, not fun to read","The devil and a bunch of his companions land in 1930's Stalinist Moscow and wreck havoc on the officially atheist city. What follows is an, in my opinion, incomprehensible tangle of out-of-the-ordinary events, not made any easier to comprehend due to the impression that one half of the male characters in the book seems to be called Nikolai Ivanovitsch and the other half Ivan Nikolaievitsch. There are probably a lot of very witty references to biblical events, but most of these will have escaped my atheist attention. In short: this was no fun to read."
3,An admirable third attempt at a translation ends in failure,"""The Master and Margarita,"" possesses a remarkable quality -- everyone loves it. I refer of course to Russians, who read, read, and re-read this book on a regular basis. I shall not dwell on the book itself -- it has been done by others, but refer specifically to this translation. The translation fails. It is more accurate than the mediocre Ginsburg and the abominable Glenny translations, but it lacks in exactitude, and the English is dry and boring. People do glimpse the wonder of the original through this attempt at re-telling, but it is merely a glimpse. My hope is that the upcoming (fourth!!!) translation, done by the same team that did the wonderful work on the ""Brothers Karamazov"" will be worthy of the original."
3,A very dated but interesting piece of satirical fiction,"For someone living under the grip of the Stalinist regime, the account in this novel must have been cathartic. I find it all a bit exaggerated and silly. It was recommended by a friend as the best novel ever written. That's going a bit far, but it is well done and amusing."
2,Didn't enjoy this much...,"I found that Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita failed to live up to hype, mostly because of the writing style and the dated content. The story is written in classic Russian style: confusing points of reference, an abundance of minutia and too many characters. I could never get into and wondered at the point of it all. It might have been entertaining in a phantasmagorical sort of way in the mid 20th century, but turns out to be slow and tame by today's standards. Despite numerous attempts, I've never been able to get into Russian literature; something to consider about the reviewer."
4,The Devil came to Moscow,"A misdirect followed by a fantastical tour of the diabolical.What does the Devil mean to us? Along with his companions (the jester, the knight, the fool, the witch) he swivels the whole of Moscow on its axis and shakes loose the city's structure. His efforts are more unrelenting than evil. But I mean, really only slightly less evil than what you might expect from typical depictions of Satan.It's cut through with passages of a novel (written by the titular Master) about Pontius Pilate, and describes an alternate but recognizable crucifixion, along with subsequent events and those leading up to it. These were less interesting to me. But I'm sure they mean something.I liked it. Not too long. Vivid and unexpected in atypical places."
5,My favourite,"Spare the time for yourself and do read it. World will never be the same afterwards :) Knowing the Russian culture is not a must, but helps a lot."
4,piltosis,one of themost bizarre readings i've ever had. but delightful -like satanic fairytale and the end scenes between the master magarita and jesus and pilate were just as moving as hell.
5,"read this book, or so help me...","Yes, OK, here we have a nice translation (O'conor and Burgin) of one of the best works of art ever, so what are you waiting for?Last year I was lucky enough to stumble upon this gem. It made happier then I've been for some time. I can't believe this was not taught to me in college. I want my money back! Forget whatever it is you are currently reading and read this."
1,i side with those who have called this tedious.,"this book has been hanging out at my house for about 20 years now, and i finally decided it was time for it to earn its keep. well, i'm now giving it the boot. off to the goodwill with the thing. this is suppose to be a masterpiece of scottish literature. ?. c'mon, you scots can do better than this! i know you can. this book is so weighed down with obscure & tedious scottish vernacular that i simply could not finish it. i made it to about page 100, then said, ""i'm outta here."" if you are one of the folks who love this book, well: God love you. this book just was not my cup of tea, and i'm sure legions of others will feel the same way. the unsuspecting should be better forwarned about what lays between the covers of this book. that's my aim here. job done."
4,Yes Please...,"This is a great indie film. Other than that actor who plays the club manager (he sucked!) I thought this was a cool fare. It's like John Woo in his early begginings. Check it out if your into a good buddy flick with guns, robbery and redemption. It's also nice to see a film use CANADIAN currency and not fake that its New York!"
1,SAD CD BY KAI HANSEN,"I don't know what passed through Kai Hansen's mind when he recorded this CD. It is by far the weakest Gamma Ray CD, it seems another completely different band from ""LAND OF THE FREE"" and other albuns. It's horrible."
1,This is not Gamma Ray,"This Cd sucks. It's like Kai Hansen is not thu guitar player in this record. It's very, very bad. Maybe he was trying his way after leaving Helloween, and the result was catastrophic. There's not one good song in this CD. This is not Gamma Ray. Gamma Ray is ""Insanity and Genius"", ""Land of The Free"", ""Powerplant""."
5,My kid loved it!,"I purchased this hat along withAdult Men's Weathered Pirate Costume ShirtThe hat was great, the shirt was a little thin though. But all and all it worked great for my event."
3,pirate hat,well you get what you pay for here. The had is VERY big and is able to adjust size but my head is so small it really didn't matted. Flimsy
3,First movie of Van Damme.,Not a great movie but a special item for colletor. That's the first movie of JCVD. For the real fan.
2,Beautiful,"Any film with Michelle Bauer is worth seeing, and the kick-boxing scene with Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme is interesting."
2,Juan Claude,The only good part of this movie is when juan claud grabbed the guy in the pants. over all it was pretty stupid. very bad sound effects for the kicks.
2,Mediocre Script Predictable with no Suspense,"Which ""Hitchcock"" inspired this? Some of Alfred's camera work, perhaps, the sort that has become a cliche in serial killer flicks. This script, however, has far less subtlety than ""Seven"" and few surprises. Moreau is always appealing in some way, but she is so businesslike in this role that the apparent fascination that her victims show for her is not credible even as comic parody of predatory men. Two of the revenge killings had promising storylines. One of these worked well. In the second she was an artist's model in a character that parodied the men, but the parody wasn't highlighted, the episode missed opportunities for added interest and thus seemed too long for nothing. Same for the film."
3,The Bride Wore Black (1968) - Francois Truffaut,"The Bride Wore Black is yet another average film by the always irregular French director Francois Truffaut. Truffaut is such a talented director that it's a shame he never quite found his place before his untimely death. Barrowing elements from Hitchcock, and mixing it with some oddly placed comedy, The Bride Wore Black is a mishmash of cruelty and farse that never comes together to form anything coherent. Visually the film is good, and the music is nice and fitting, but none of these elements saves the ridiculous story from veering off in too many different directions. The Bride Wore Black is ultimately a film that doesn't know what it wants to be, just as Truffaut never quite found what type of films he wanted to make."
2,He did to Hitchcock what the Germans did to Poland in WW2,"I was expecting at least a glimpse of the substance present in the Hitchcock movies. After all, the movie is supposed to be a homage to the creator of Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window. Instead, all we got is some style and a plot with less suspense than the average scooby-doo episode. It has a lot in common with B-movies such as the Theatre of Blood (1973 - Vincent Price), where all you get to expect is a series of killings. If watching a mad and average looking woman for two hours, who will stop at nothing to get her ""revenge"" (even using a 5-year old so she can turn him into an orphan) excites you, than this movie is for you."
1,Not in English,I didn't even get to watch it. It was in French. Good price and quick shipment though.
1,a big let down,I was exteremely disappointed with Trauffaut. The movie lacked any simple sensibility there should be in a movie. What is being called suspenseful by most reviewers is strange as there is nothing suspenseful about the kind of killings she was doing etc. The director rarely shows the trauma of what led her to be so keen on revenge etc. I think the movie was quite silly and very hard to believe.
2,Two Stars For The Score Only,Bernard Hermman's score is magnificent. This was a major let down for me considering it was directed by Truffaut. Lacked any real suspense and edge. Boring camera work for the most part. Some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster. The acting was fine...I guess. It was just a pointless story I felt that really didn't go anywhere. And what was with that crummy ending?
3,Haydn's The Deserted Island,"This opera by Haydn is wonderful, with beautiful, well performed arias, a somewhat dark overature and an elegant finale. The one thing that keeps me from giving it a 4 or 5 star rating is the aria to recitative ratio. There are about 3 recitative for each aria, and many of the recitatives are quite long."
3,good movie but disc was damaged,"It is a good movie to talk over with unbelievers. It is kind of slow to begin with but if you stick with it , it is worth it and is a good conversational starter. Beware of where you purchase this. This disc was damaged but there was no one to contact to exchange through amazon. Was not worth paying the shipping costs."
1,Sophomoric,"For a room full of people with IQs over 200 IQ, the level of conversation about the big questions facing the globe were below the average of an undergraduate's dorm after a heavy night's drinking. The questions and solutions were trite, simplistic, and wrong. There was quite a bit of discussion on whether God exists, and the answers pro and con were so dumb that one wonders in the the producer, writer and director Tim Chey had ever actually read about this topic before he wrote the script. The only saving grace in this movie was an over the top role by Tom Sizemore, playing the maniac threatening to destroy DC with a nuke. By the end, I was rooting for the bomb to be detonated.Save your money and buy something else, anything else."
5,Misleading as it barely discusses God,"I would recommend this to anyone because it is challenging and you might learn from it. Most of this dark movie had intense scenes; I found it to be overly profound since it discussed a lot of serious issues and conspiracies. Here's what I can recite from memory:Why hasn't there been a cure found for cancer?Why does toner ink cost so much?Why are there starving people in the world?If you were a dictator, what is the first thing you would do?What is the meaning of life? (they mentioned God a little here and that was it for the whole movie)There were so many characters to keep track of, it might be overwhelming for some, but they all contributed equally and you got to see many shades of their personality. I enjoyed this movie very much and cried a lot at the end (good actors)."
5,THE WAY,THE ITEM WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.
3,Condition was less than expected for book,"While this was a great value for the money, I was a little disappointed that it was a little more marked in than I would have liked. The good news is that the previous owner did somewhat get the message that her dad wanted her to receive,based on the personal messages. I could have never parted with this book-""The Way, The Living Bible."""
4,"Norton's Anthology of World Masterpieces, a review","This seventh edition has left out the poetry of John Donne, the great metaphysical poet. Big mistake. I was disappointed in the translation of Gilgamesh, considering Stephen Mitchell's version to be superior. I was also disappointed in the Bible excerpts - particularly Genesis, where there is no indication that the redactor of the selections picked and chose between J, E and P texts, with no indication of the lacunae, making it seem as if there were only one version, for instance, of the Creation or the Flood, while any biblical scholar knows that there are at least two. My overall impression, however, is that this offers a fair introduction to Western world literature to the mid-seventeenth century."
4,World Masterpiece,Wide collection of works and translations. I really enjoyed the translation of Homer in the Iliad. Norton's Anthology has help transform literature from being boring to being fun.
4,not what Im looking for,the shipping was fast..great service by the seller.. but this is just not what I needed in my class.. bought wrong book
2,I've read it but still don't know who the killer(s) is/are,"Perry does her usual fine job with this Pitt mystery, but it is the worst example of the one flaw I have found in every Perry Pitt and Monk mystery.That flaw: that although she solves the mystery in the last pages, she also always leaves all kinds of secondary story threads hanging. I always want to know more about the characters, about what happens after the killer has been caught. Agatha Christie, in fewer pages, provides just as much detail about the characters but still manages to tie up all the story threads.The ending of Ashworth Hall, however, has an even more serious flaw (no spoiler here): it is not at all clear who the murderer(s) is/are. I've read the last few pages several times and I am still not sure who did what to whom. It is frustrating in the extreme."
3,Not Anne Perry's Best,"As a diehard Anne Perry fan, I was disappointed in Ashworth Hall. I couldn't stay with it. I don't know what went wrong! I have loved every other book she's written, and I've read all but the newest Thomas and Charlotte, and one Monk. Ashworth Hall didn't seem like an Anne Perry book at all."
3,"Not bad, not great, either","Having read all of the Pitt and Monk novels, I find myself continuing to look forward to the next one despite seeing the same flaws repeated from novel to novel. The real strength of her writing, and which fascinates me, is the characterization of interesting people-their lives and emotions- during an exciting period in time. The mysteries themselves often require such amazing leaps in logic and fantastic coincidences that I find my belief occasionally strained. This does not detract from my enjoyment of the novels, however!"
2,A disappointment,"For six dollars i am sure there are many books on paper aeroplanes better than this. Four designs, two obvious to anyone, is all you get. A quick internet search would have been better and free. There was a foam plane in there as well, but really not worth the trouble. Oh, did i foreget to mention the stickers?The best part is the box, it looks great. It certainly fooled me into thinking there might be something worth while in side. In summary, a rip off."
3,This is great...,"...if you are an only child or a bachelor with no pets. Otherwise, you should have no shortage of targets."
3,Good for the price- not original artists,"Lots of songs for the price, but I wish I had realized that the songs were not performed by the original artists. Just know what you're getting before you order this product. My seven year old son will probably still love it... there's no accounting for taste."
5,A revolution in art and art in revolution,"This book will give you a good understanding of the surrealist movement. You will read the artists' writings not only on this subject, but also their views on the important political questions of the day which they understood were tied to cultural questions. A photo display in the book gives you a sampling of surrealist works. There is also an excellent glossary of names that reveals the evolution of the surrealists in later years. You gain an appreciation for the international breadth of the movement. 'What is Surrealism?' is not just for art history students. Anyone wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between art and politics will be fascinated by collection of articles in this book."
1,definitely not what I expected....,I was less than impressed with this book. The quality of the type is practically impossible to read. It looks like it was poorly copied from the original text. Get a different version. I am looking to return it...
1,wont work for someone with asthma,"This breathalyzer will not work for anyone suffering from breathing problems like asthma, or COPD. There is no possible way to force enough air through it to get any kind of reading. This was a total waste of money. If you have any of these conditions choose something else."
1,Unbelievable disappointment,"I purchased this device after reading about it being DOT approved for Law Enforcement, coast guard certified and yaddiyaddiyadda. When I unpacked it and installed the batteries I notice that the pivot point for the battery cover is about a 1/32"" plastic tab. The battery cover latch was no better. After installing the batteries and snapped the cover shut, they promptly ejected out the bottom of it... multiple times. This thing is made to the same standard as a carnival souvenir. In reading about the accuracy of the device in the manual provided it states ""Accuracy at a Blood Alcohol Concentration greater than 0.032 has not been evaluated"" The manual also states that a BAC level of 0.05% and over could impair your ability to drive. People are trusting this device to insure that their driving may not be impaired although the manual confirms that this device is not a safe method to test your BAC in those ranges."
2,a big letdown,"I bought this unit because another reviewer said it gave consistent readings and was of good quality. Unfortunately, neither is the case with mine.Readings vary considerably from test to test, and a level of 0.000 has been returned more than once after a drink or two, so I have little confidence in its accuracy.Not only that, but it's fashioned from flimsy plastic which doesn't hold itself together well enough for the battery cover to stay on by itself. The ""CE"" logo looks fake, and the whole item feels very cheaply made indeed.Could be I just got unlucky. Either way, a waste of a hundred bucks."
2,Product picture is not representative of what is delivered,The picture clearly shows a bag of some sort that hold the breathalyzer and the pocket case. It appears to be a much larger fabric case. This case does not come with the order. It is being misrepresented!
5,Great Features and Accuracy!,"I owned a breathalyzer in the past, and the worst part was periodically having to mail it in to the manufacturer for calibration service. I really like that the Prestige uses the replaceable sensors, so I can just swap them out when it comes time (The test counter is good for letting me know when). All my tests have been really accurate for me, as long as I wait 20 minutes after drinking, like it says in the manual. I don't know about comparing it to police breathalyzers either, I think they cost ten times as much."
4,Useful even when you don't have it,"I got this breathalyzer because of a inability to judge when I was ""legally"" drunk. After some informal testing, it seems to work as advertised. It's small and easy to carry. Plus, after using it a while, I'm better able to judge my level of intoxication even when I don't have it.Also very handy at parties when an inebriated guest is insistent on leaving. If they pass the test they can have their keys!"
3,People hatin on N8ives...,"This book by Theodora Kroebar describes how the life is for a Yana Indian(or any type of Indian). In the book, the Yana are on of the last N8ive tribes left in the U.S. Some lady finds Ishi talkin to his self in his own language. So she teaches him to talk English. In the book, the white people hate on the N8ives and kill them and take their land."
4,Ishi,The book is probably better suited for a younger reader but I think I appreciated it a little more now that I've been to the places described in the book. As with many books that try to write from the perspective outside the culture of the person who is writing the book I think the author tried too hard to avoid using any words or concepts outside of the Yuni language. There are times when it would have been better to let the narrator step in and fill the blanks.
1,"A dead ""classic""","My son was given this book as a middle school assignment. My son is an avid reader and yet he fell asleep trying to read this. I tried to read Ishi in an attempt to help him through it and discovered that I (also an avid reader) couldn't slog through it either. The language is entirely too formal and (dare I say it?) stereotypical. In some ways, I felt as if I were watching a 1960's western.The subject matter is excellent, but this fictional treatment is dated and stale. It's time for a new one."
3,It's a historical novel,"I was disappointed to find that I had bought the wrong book. ""Ishi: Last of His Tribe"" is not a variant title for ""Ishi: Between Two Worlds"". This is a novelisation of Ishi's story aimed at younger readers, and one where Yahi culture is rather heavily idealised. I was looking for some solid anthropology, which, I suppose, is to be found in the other book."
1,Another old book in a fresh new cover,"A waste of paper. This book is old info and lots of useless filler. IMO, almost completely uselss. Don't waste your time and money."
3,View from inside,"I live in Russia and I am old enough to remember last decades of the ""Communist"" rule. I was interested in a book with external view, with ideas, thoughts and information that could be new for me, with something strange, unimaginable etc. I found standard curses towards the Bolsheviks. I appreciate and I share them but they are of no real interest."
4,"Perfect for Cold weather, but not for warm","This sleeping bag is perfect for sleeping in cold temperatures. But in hot weather, it makes you sweat. This should be used on temperatuers between 60 degrees and 30 degrees."
4,The book is fantastic,"in every aspect. Lots of pictures I had not seen before, in color (unusual for the period) and a great deal of information for the interested person in this time of 20th century history.Why am I not giving it 5 stars?Well, the book is a German one and is written in German. With it comes a handy translation to English for the picture's notes and captions but and this is my point, almost a third of the book is text, in German, explaining relevant stuff regarding life in the Rastenburg bunker and HQ. For this text THERE IS NO translation. Accepted, translating these pages surely is a work in itself but I would have happily paid an extra fee for having an English version of this information.As it is now I have only half a book, so to speak.But as I said, the book is terrific."
5,wonderfull colloured picturs,This book has everything for entuiastic people with interrest of the Third Reich.It is good illustrated in text and photos.
3,The Tar-Aiym Krang,"The Tar-Aiym KrangThis is the second book in the Pip and Flinx series and, in it we find Flinx starting his career as a star traveler. And also we see him growing more in his talent.This book, introduces us to the characters Truzenzuzex and Tse-Mallory who I particularly like, I find that Flinx learned a lot from them, and also I like them simply on their own, for who they are.I appreciated the Lynx, not because I believe they should be but, because I think that this book showed why they shouldn't be!"
1,Severely Disappointed...,"I found myself buying this book to gain a separate insight on a pilgrimage through the sacred sights of Peru... as I have done this process twice myself.I was severely disappointed when three chapters into the book the only impression I had was that this author was more interested in going on about her guide in this journey than in the journey itself.I tried to keep reading, but couldn't, so I flipped to the end to see if maybe it had gotten better and there was an insight there that I would find worth reading the book for, but no, the final sentence had her looking back to the guide, instead of to herself or the mountains or the earth any of which I would have found the book worth reading for."

1,Black Scorpion II,"This is perhaps the worst movie ever made. While Joan Severance is the most beautiful actress in the world even her looks didn't salvage this terrible movie. If they had shown some of her body they might have offered some redemption just from the sex appeal effect alone, but they didn't and there was no salvation. I couldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,Better Than Expected - Fun Action,"The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie. If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place. This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason. Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 15 year old flic stood up as well as it did. Not great, not awful, just okay."
5,If you want to learn (Jesus' life) according to Matthew,"If you are lazy, and you want to read the bible (Matthew's gospel). Here you has the solution!!! Excellent movie, because you go watching the gospel (appears the chapter and the verse). Very educactional!!!"
2,A cheesy portrayal of Jesus!,"I watched this and was just mystified at how they portrayed Jesus. Jesus was ""a man of sorrows aquainted with grief"", as Isaiah says and I didn't get that from this movie. They should have had Henry Ian Cusick play Jesus as he did in The Gospel of John movie. However, I did enjoy hearing the pure Gospel of Matthew."
1,"Well done production, defiled with symbolism","What a shame such a well done production had to be defiled with symbolism: at 1:33:00 when Jesus was speaking about Matthew 12:33, a woman is overtly shown looking through a triangular lattice with one eye as the other eye is blocked. Without this unnecessary defilement I would have rated this at a five star. It is very disappointing that this Christian production could not be free of symbolism."
5,A Classic western!,"Zane Grey's bestselling novels have thrilled generations of readers with heart-and-guts characters, hard-shooting action, and high-plains panoramas. To save his cowboy gambler brother, Bruce Lockheart takes to the fugitive trail for a crime he didn't commit, and is hotly pursued by a relentless ranger and the woman who loves him."
3,Incorrect info in description,"The true weight of this item, after weighing myself with and then without the bag, is 6 pounds. On the box it also clearly states that it is good to 35 degrees, not 25 as listed in this description. The ""3 lb"" noted is the weight of the fill, not the bag.My dog loves the bag so she may get it for a bed. Luckily I signed up for the credit card and got $30 off the price so $25 for a pup bed isn't too bad.It is really nice and plush and the pillow is great. I just received it and haven't actually used it under real camping conditions, but I think it may be too big and/or too heavy to take on my hike. I'll give it a shot and write a revised review."
4,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable afternoon read to learn about France, it's fedal past, disparity of classes, kings and nobles, revolution and its various experiments with social egalitarianism as a response to a millenium of oppressive rule by its own increasingly aloof nobility. Fascinating to learn how the nobilty actually became entrapped by their own separation from the peasantry and in essence bacame slaves themselves to the Court by the pensions they accepted from the Crown that itself was bankrupt even though it levied ever heavier taxes on the workers.Can there be parallels to today's social economic systems that pay out to government workers? Are the non-government workers becoming a form of over taxed peasantry and pensioners a form of government supported nobility?The history ends in late 1800's.You will want to have some historical maps of Europe handy."
2,very basic,"It is understandable why this book is free. It indeed is a short history of France from medieval times to late 1800's. Because it is short many finer details are left out and references to people and places leave one slightly confused, if they lack a basis of French history. It is however a decent ""starter"" book if you want to start to read books about any history, and will give you somewhere to start if you are looking to research this topic."
2,I'm glad its free,"I know its a SHORT history, but I found this to be much to superficial, skimpy, and uninteresting. To complicated and confusing regarding Midieval France, vey light on Napoleon III and stops at 1870 period. I was lookiing forward to the French Revolution section but I was disappointed. I didn't add to my understanding of the period."
3,Not Welfonder's Best,"I have read all of her other books except Master of the Highlands and found this one to be my least favorite. There just wasn't ever a moment when the main characters weren't going to get together. Robbie's bride-to-be, the main problem just disappears! Her character did not seem like the type to just run off with her lover after ranting through out the rest of the book on how she is going to destroy Robbie. Love Welfonder's other books, this one just didn't live up to my expectations."
5,My Predictions are coming to pas...,"If I could give this book a 10 I would....Sue-Ellen just getsbetter with every book she writes. Oh My God!...I was in Scotland in every page of the book. Her love of Scotland comesout in every written word. It is so AWESOME how she can make youfeel the wind on your face and smell the gorse and heather, smell the peat fires. As I predicted with her very first book, she is a writer to watch and read. I shall not miss a single book of hers as I get goose bumps just reading them as I have a love of Scotland myself.I don't think any one would be disappointed in reading this book and I so look forward to her next one. I was really awaiting Robbie's story and was extremely pleased with her results. Fell in love with Robbie and Julianna, and Kenneth too. Would like to see his story also."
1,Not worth your time,This book is so boring and hard to follow the story. I don't recommend this one at all. My first time reading this author and I don't think I will try her other books. No dialogs at all...
2,Not what I expected.,"I just read this book after reading another Welfonder ""Knight"" book and even though I gave this book a shot thinking the other book was maybe not her best(new author to me). These books do too much talking of lore,demons,dragons and atmosphere and not nearly enough about the main characters. I would read another Welfonder book, but there would be nothing else available and I'd be prepared to turn past the overdone descriptions. Read with caution."
3,Not As Good As Expected,"As I read throught the story I kept expecting something to happen. Well it didn't. It wasn't all that I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, the story was very well written and the characters well liked but there wasn't that spark that draws you in. At least there wasn't for me. Others might find it more enjoyable."
3,Barely a three star!,"Perhaps Scottish romances are just not my thing - although I love Kinley McGregor books - so maybe it is just the style of writing of Welfonder. But, I just found this book very hard to get into. There was just too much mystic talk, talk of lore and potions and fantasy for my taste. There was also too much discriptions of thoughts and feelings and not enough dialog and real action between the characters in the book. And the betrothed of Robbie was truly a strange one and I just never got into why she had such real hate for him or what her whole deal was hiding away in the tower plotting her revenge on him and then she goes with her Big Red. Very odd plot I felt. And Robbie and Juliana did seem to have a romantic connection but it was not delved into enough to my taste. The sizzle in this book was luke warm at best. I just did not see what others that rated this book so highly did. I am not sure I I will read other books by this author!"
2,"looked a little used, like really used","I know these dolls are suppose to look a little ragged (I have another one), but this one was just dirty and used from the package."
1,These were low grade knock-offs made in Indonesia,"Horrible product. Poor quality. Many flaws with each piece. Research shows that these were made in Indonesia where they have no Quality Control. This order was not for one place setting.........but for five sets. It was my wif'e Christmas present. Amazon has only refunded me for one of the five place settings that I sent back. Horrible silverware..........and so far.....horrible customer service from Amazon. I've always had such good service in the past, but this is a nightmare to say the least !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best Flatware Ever Owned,"I have owned this set for 18 years and still enjoy adding pieces! My family uses it as our everdyay flatware and all other occasions because it's design goes so well with everything and it washes beautifully in the dishwasher! The reason I first chose this set was because of how comfortable it is to hold. I love the full rounded shape and could never go back to pieces that are flat, no matter how expensive or beautiful. Every time I have had to add extra spoons or forks, etc., the pieces blend together very nicely. Thank You Oneida! There are very few things I have owned for more than a few years that did not need replacing or that I grew tired of seeing every day."
1,A Horrible Example of Blaxploitation,"I've always been a big Pam Grier fan, however this is definitely not her best film. Unfortunately like many blaxploitation films, this film seemed so monotenous and predictable. It felt like another movie that was being cranked out of the blaxploitation factory, one that was not made with any care or originality. This film puts to shame a lot of great Blaxploitation films of the era, such as ""Shaft"", ""Uptown Saturday Night"" (which features a young Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, and Harry Belafonte) and ""Cooley High"", just to name a few. If you insist on seeing this film, I would recommend renting it first."
4,Errors and omissions,From the information from other sites I am to believe that this is not an 'Anamorphic/16:9 enhanced' DVD. Foxy Brown is. All Region 2's in the MGM Blaxploitation-series are...
5,One of the Best Of The Blaxploitation Genre,"This is one of my favorite movies. Coffy is a nurse by day and a vigilante by night, seeking revenge on the drug dealers who turned her twelve-year-old sister into a junkie.Technically this movie falls into a genre known as blaxploitation, low-budget films of the early 1970's with the main characters being played by black actors, but this movie was one of the higher quality films of the genre, and Coffy transformed Pam Grier into an international movie star.Coffy comes together as a quality film because the character is so likeable, and a standard B-movie formulaic plot is transformed into a really good movie. This isn't Shakespeare or Masterpiece Theatre, just a fun, fast-paced movie with a lot of action, fast cars and a female heroine in the lead role, and a good script that leads to an ending that is worthy of the entire film."
3,Grier is Fantastic the Queen of B-movies,I think that this movie is exciting sexy and most of all full of adventure. I think that Pam Grier truly shows her acting ability as well as her fantastic figure and sex appeal. She not just another pretty face on the big screen. This movie is definitly the bomb!
4,Old explotation movie,"In the seventies I ran this movie in my theatre many times and made money hand over fist. Although pretty lame by todays standards, it brought back many memories of my theatre days."
1,Novelty,"As one of the reviewers had put it, the title and contents doesn't match out, as the bk is more crochet oriented and the instructions for fair isle is a bit confusing to a novice.But the book does have some interesting points with instructions on how to crochet flowers on to clogs and making a half sock on to the opening of a clog. Readable but otherwise don't think I wil get it."
4,A Beguiling Movie,"Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner) in Francois Truffaut's ""The Man Who Loved Women"" wants every woman he sees and usually gets and beds them and then writes a book about his conquests. And that's most of what happens in this amusing film by one of the great film directors. Morane is likeable and perhaps lovable and certainly is never cruel to the women he meets. He just is determined to continue making notches on his gun. There is some indication that he was hurt when Vera (Leslie Caron) broke up with him four, five years ago although we are never completely sure-- at least I wasn't-- as to why he seeks quantity over quality. Certainly, however, the women he gets involved with, if just for a night, are for the most part lookers.The movie is beautifully filmed as we see frame after frame of women's gorgeous legs for Morane sees them everywhere. Both the beginning and ending are quite brilliant.A pleasant way to spent two hours of your life."
2,Dated classic,"Although the film is a classic, it is very dated and painful to watch for the average American viewer. Messages is not decipherable for US"
5,"Highly enjoyable, sexy and engaging film","This film will hold your interest - even after you've left your tv set. Truffaut's film is insightful, sexy, depressing and entertaining. Check it out and you will marvel at how the main characters become art!"
2,A Naturalist Out of His Element,"In his introduction, Eldredge asserts that we have to get beyond such myths as the assertion in Genesis that God meant man to have dominion over all of nature, and that stories are important. Much of the book reviews the science of paleantology, which the field of his discipline. But I saw little convincing connection between that material and the extinction of animals which existed in prehistoric times. He speculates that the cave man artists who lived at least 30,000 years before the writing of Genesis, painted animals as a symbolic means of gaining dominance over them. In the Afterward, he proposes ""A New Story"", in which he ignores real history of human understanding of our place in the world. He offers no clear evidence of a connection between his exegesis of Genesis and the massive extinctions of species in our times. Perhaps he should read more widely and become aquainted with St Francis of Assisi."
4,Return With Me to 11th Grade,"I had a GREAT English teacher in the 11th grade (he was the chairman of the department), and he kept us busy reading over a dozen works of great literature (mostly American literature, but some others). We read, among others, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Hawthorne, Sherwood Anderson, Shakespeare, and Hardy's ""Return of the Native."" I'm a gosh awful procrastinator, and waited until the weekend before the exam to begin this book. No sweat! I was so immersed in this story, I finished it with enough time to watch some tv on Sunday night!Why did I share all the above with you? So that I could make the following point: Of all the great literature I read that year, this was my very, very favorite. Don't miss this one!"
5,Disturbing portrayal of human nature.,"This novel is a true work of art. Hardy not only constructed an ingenius and unique storyline, but in it he's made the reader feel the surroundings and become one with the characters. Each of the characters (Eustacia, Cly, Wildeve, Mrs.Yeobright, Venn) have both have a humane and selfless side, as well as a wicked and selfish side. He's made the characters respond to their situations realistically, and in doing so has produced one of the most accurate portrayals of human nature and response. Overall, reading it was good experience."
5,Velvet At Its Absolute Best,"After listening to Return of the Native, I was simply amazed. The story was so good and I really enjoyed it. But what really took my breath away was the sensational reading of the very talented and very sexy, Alan Rickman. He just owned those characters. He gave each character a unique voice and personality. I just cannot get over how good he was. Oh, and did I mention he sings in french!!!! After listening to that part, I was speechless. I feel like I had just melted it was so beautiful!! I recommend this to ANY Rickmaniac!:)"
1,zzzzzzzz,"This is defintly not my idea of a page-turning book and I hope it isn't your either. My 9th grade teacher had our class read this over the summer. If you're assigned to this book, please!! Oh please try and get out of the assignment. This book is no fun and my best suggestion is to skip the 1 1/2 chapter and you should be better off. All it really talks about is the heath and that is n't really important. Good luck to you all and may god be with you."
3,what's everyone so excited about?,"A buddy loaned this to me, claiming I was going to love Alan Rickman's reading.While I am a huge fan of this book (in my opinion, Hardy's best), Rickman's reading, while far from bad, is nothing special.His pace is monotonous and he makes scant effort to mimic the voices of various characters. It's a reading, pure and simple. Not a dramatization by any means, or a single sound effect. It is completely unabridged, however.Alan Rickman, in case you don't know, is the guy who's made a career out of playing fey villains, such as the Sheriff of Nottingham in that 80's version of ""Robin Hood,"" with Kevin Costner."
5,"If you're bored, you're boring.","As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick. Welcome to the Millenium."
1,This is NOT Alan Rickman!,"Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey. Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket."
2,long & boring,"I had (note the word had, not got)to read Return of the Native for Honors English. If you're one of those people that likes to just sit back and relax and read a nice easy to follow, understandable book, DON'T read this one. However, if you can handle the Heath peoples' odd speech, an exotic word choice, and long, drawn out descriptions of EVERYTHING, this book's for you! I think Return of the Native had a good, interesting plot, but it was so long winded that it was hard to pay attention (I fell asleep everyday in that class for two weeks reading this)."
2,Ponderous and epherial story of life on the heath.,This novel is very long and very tedious in it's detail and desciption of events. Not for the casual reader.
3,The definitive review,"Actually this book was better than I expected, its quite good in places especially the ending (where they all die) sorry but it was for your own good now nobody needs to actually read it! Back to the point its unusual for me to give a book a good review so you had better make the most of it! In short its alright! The highlight is the bright red man lurking throughout the novel."
4,Conflicts of the Native,"Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy is one of the most exciting, dramatic, and sad novels I have read upto date. Thomas Hardy creates Eustacia to bring a heroine into the story, also to bring excitement and to create confusion for many characters. Clym is the native that returns to the heath. Clym meets Eustacia and there is an immediate attraction between the two. Hardy also creates the character Wildeve, to confuse Eustacia. The book displays great examples of conflicts, for example Mrs.Yeobright and Eustacia, Eustacia and Susan, and Eustacia against herself. The reoccurring theme that Hardy shows in the book seems to happen to be somehow related to Eustacia. I recommend that you read the book to experience the feelings that Eustacia went through."
4,very unsettling,Michael Hanecke is one of my new favorite directors - with portraits like the piano teacher and cache - he has become one of the heavy-hitters of world cinema.. 'Time of the wolf' is perhaps his most unnerving and his most timely and relevant venture to date... It inhabits a post-apocolyptic world which somewhat reminds me of Bergman's 'shame' and Tarkovsky's the 'sacrifice'.. But this is something new at the same time.. Hanecke raises even more questions than he answers.. the characters are even more aloof and deranged.. This is a kind of warning to our modern world - we can't escape from our own humanity afterall.
5,Western Movies,I have always liked James Garner. He plays a great part in this movie too. The movie got to me in one piece so I trust the company that sent it. I will use this company again when I need them.
2,A pretty flimsy book,"Yes, it does provide a new model for black reparations. However, the book thinks it is smarter than it is. The author makes an extremely weak case for even having black reparations in the first place. The case is essentially that Germany did it, so we should too. It ignores several key points, such as who will actually be hurt by the reparations (non-blacks) and the issue of fighting injustice with injustice. He wants repartions for slavery, but the victims and perpitrators are long dead. If you are looking to be convinced that there should be reparations, this certainly is not the book. If you are ready to jump to the conclusion that we need them (I certainly am not) then I guess this could be a possible way to go at it. Check out the Penn and Teller season 4 episode on reparations."
3,Bill Nelson - Getting The Holy Ghost Across,"Bill Nelson - Getting The Holy Ghost Across - LP release from 1986, not yet available on CD (as of this writing).Tracks are:SIDE ONE1. Suvasini2. Contemplation3. Theology4. Wildest Dreams5. Lost In Your MysterySIDE TWO1. Rise Like A Fountain2. Age Of Reason3. The Hidden Flame4. Because Of You5. Pansophia"
2,"Great beats, butchered vocals.","I'm getting sick of remixes nowadays, what with their philosophy of ""we'll make a good trance song, then throw in a few samples of the original track at the last minute"". When a song has vocals this good (and few do), why in God's name would you strip them out and just loop one line?! Of all five tracks, only two have more than one verse included, and only one remains faithful to the feeling of the original. This track, the last one, is actually a very cool remix and the only thing saving this disc from complete failure. Oh yeah, whatever happened to including the album mix on singles as well? Is it just an evil sceme to get us to buy the GAWD-AWEFUL domsestic release of ""Movement in Still Life"", rather than paying a few dollars more for the far, far, FAR superior double disc import? Why, BT, WHY?!!"
1,THIS IS CRAP!,"Okay, i like BT. But after hearing these remixes i would like to say i don't. I like the original song just fine, but these are terrible. I completely agree with zacariahs review stating that the remixes are awful. I also think that the import MISL is soooo much better. BT is conspiring against america..."
1,Poor quality product,"Do not buy. I purchased the Satin Garnet in June 2011. By September 2011 noticed many of the knives had black blemishes on them. Contacted Oneida, and they were willing to give a credit if I bought a different pattern. I upgraded and chose the Easton pattern. Even though Oneida had an on-line sale at the time, they said that I had to buy it at the regular retail price. In addition to paying the price difference of the patterns, I also had to pay currency exchange and sales tax.In Jan 2012, my husband noticed that on one of the knives, the blade moves when holding the knife by the handle. Two weeks ago, I discovered a black blemish on one of the knives and set it aside. I am definitely now happy about this. Not sure what Oneida will do when I tell them this time about these defects.I bought the Frostfire pattern over 35 years ago. They are great and I never had a problem with them. I believe this flatware was made in Canada or the U.S. Not the new products."
1,Junk,We received this flatware for our wedding and it began to tarnish within 3 weeks! Very disappointing....fortunately we were able to return it to the store.
3,helpful but very californian,"The best thing about this cookbook is the recipes for homemade Tortillas. There are multiple ways to fill them, too--but I have to say, unless your tastes are pretty ""Californian"" rather than Tex-Mex (or just Mex!), you will be puzzled and perhaps not pleased. I'm glad I bought the book, though; we use it once a month or so (more than many other cookbooks!)."
4,Tortilla's galore,A great book with simple and quick recipies. No need to run out to the store for soft tortillas. Just whip them up and they are good to go.
4,well filled tortilla cookbook,great cookbook w/ lots of creative ideas for tortilla based meals. Definitely not for the authentic hispanic cuisine purist as it deviates quite a bit from authentic mexican/south american meals in my experience. There are many delicious ideas none the less. I purchased this w/ a tortilla press and it contains a few recipes for tortilla dough. I am very excited to try some of these recipes in home made tortillas.
2,TERRIBLE,"WORSE COOKBOOK EVER. THERE WAS NOT ONE RECIPE IN THE WHOLE BOOK THAT I WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
2,DITTO!,"SAME AS MY REVIEW ON THE OTHER COOKBOOK, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TRY ANYTHING YET. TIME WILL TELL"
1,Great recipies and easy to make meals,"My daughter uses this book all the time, great recipies. The entire family has gotten involved in cooking these meals."
4,Creative tacos,"I've started making my own homemade corn tortillas (I don't even use a press, just a rolling pin). Was looking for some creative fillings and this book is the answer. Some of the recipes do take some time to prepare, but most seem worth it. Fillings sound tasty and nutritious - everything from Thai shrimp to dessert concoctions. No photos but great descriptions and anecdotes. I would recommend for anyone looking to step out of the typical ground beef or chicken strips fillings."
3,Great little cook book,"This is a great cook book, I bought it with the Quesadilla maker, and so far it has been a great addition to my summer dinners."
1,Not traditional Mexican cooking,"I was not happy with this book. I must admit I was looking for traditional Mexican or even modernized Mexican recipes but this is not it. If you are looking for authentic Mexican flavors you will not find it here. Mole is more than dumping some chocolate in a chile sauce. I had much better luck with Rick Bayless, and Diane Kennedy."
1,The Not So Well-Filled Tortilla,"This is definitely a book that should be seen before bought. It required ingredients not always found in the typical home pantry. Additionally, while the title suggests Mexican food, it was almost totally Mexican and I think it would have broader appeal if it had some other types of fillings and more quesadilla recipes. (The latter is the reason I bought the book and found nearly no recipes for quesadillas.) The pictures were the high spot...excellently photographed."
4,Good Condition - What I Expected,"The recipe book has some good stuff in it and some weird stuff too, like any recipe book. It arrived in like new condition."
2,another one-shot plastic throw away,Nice light until you need to replace the battery - just try to put it back together so that it works.
2,Flimsy,"The light itself is okay. Small slide switch to turn it on and off. The beam is rather nice and tight, and I'd estimate it at 12 lumens. The problem is the case; it's too flimsy. I've had three of these, and all three have failed. One was attached to the zipper on a jacket, and the case separated in half. One half was still on my jacket, but the half with the LED and electronics was gone. Two others had the same problem, but the attachment arm was completely broken. I can't recommend this product, despite the good beam. Too many failures to be any good..."
4,Ms Scorpion gets her prey!,"Excellent futuristic comic book thriller, in the Batman theme. She gets her man; the sexy Bruce Abbott and saves the city! Joan Severance is great as the woman with the secret identity. Would make a interesting TV series only if original cast returns."
4,Scorpion Rides the Frog,"If you have a liking for B genre movies with action, a female heroine, a quasi story-line, and some nudity, then I would recommend this movie to you. The movie starts in the real world then does a rather quick shift to a sci-fi futuristic world. In a scene set in 1975, a cop-father tells his daughter, who later becomes the Scorpion, a story about a scorpion riding on a frog across a stream. Joan Severance's acting is a little weak in the beginning of the movie but improves as she dons a costume and becomes the Black Scorpion. One of the highlights is when a disrobed Joan rides her cop-partner to ecstasy, masked as the Scorpion. Hence the Scorpion takes the frog for a ride."
5,Black Scorpion Can Sting Me Any Time!,"If you love B-movies, comic books, or women dressed in bondage gear who fight crime this is your lucky day!You'll love this one! This is the perfect flick when you're looking for escapist fun as super heroine Black Scorpion battles the evil Breathtaker and his army of asthmatics the wheezing warriors! It's a blast! Joan Severance is fantastic, seductive and beautiful and her commentary and interview segment on this DVD are a delight. She is so cute and seems like she really had a blast making this movie. If you enjoy this one check out the sequel and the tv show. This is fun stuff!"
4,Super Heroine To The Rescue!,"I tell ya, I'm a sucker for a descent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengence. She laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some booty.It's a fun, action packed movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphice sex scene Severance has in it. Which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)"
3,"Good Fun, Good Action","The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie. If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place. This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason. Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 17 year old flic stood up as well as it did. Not great, not awful, just okay."
3,was ok,was given as gift for daughters weeding plans.. was ok but not as informative as we expected but all worked out well.
1,Very deceiving title!,"This book tricks you from the beginning! I did not find one Irish wedding tradition in this entire book! This is just your basic ""how to be organized wedding book"". I was very disappointed. ...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
5,The Irish Wedding Book,The Irish Wedding Book turned out to be a fantastic gift for my newly engaged niece. Her fiance is from Ireland and she has taken some great ideas from Kimberly Mcguire's well thought out book filled with old and new traditions. The Irish culture is surprisingly romantic. The wedding ideas would be great for any wedding and any heritage.
1,What a waste of money!,"Fully expecting a book rich with Irish customs, lore, and enchantment about weddings, I was unexpectedly disappointed. This is just a run of the mill ""get organized"" wedding book, not done on American soil, but British.WHERE was the Irish component? All I saw which could comend it....was that budgets were allotted in British Pounds, not US dollars.I bought this as an engagement gift for a close friend, expecting great things. How very, very, sub-par."
2,basket getto,"You want to laugh out loud, GETTO to 10th degree if you had a bad day, look at this episode and the others and you will have a good outlook about your life."
3,It is not everything I hoped for.,"I am computer proficient and am able to use a few drawing programs. I am trying to teach myself the Illustrator program using the software at my company (which is the Japanese version), so I wanted to buy an instruction book that could take me through the process as straight forward as possible. After reading through this basic book I found a few basic difficulties. Remember this book is my only way to understand the commands written in Japanese on my computer. Going through the pull-downs was difficult in my case so I would have liked to see a summary of commands. I also wish there was a list of hot keys like they have for the tools. Although the tools are mostly straight forward there are not definitions as to what each one does. The Illustrator software can do some great stuff however, I feel the book they produced needs a few basic admendments."
2,Adobe Illustrator 8.0: Classroom in a Book,"The book should have been spiral bound at the top with an inbuilt cardboard copy holder, so you could just flip the pages. As it is, you have to break the back of the book to have it lay flat.Basically, the book is just about manipulating artwork provide on CD. It isn't a real, building, step by step procedure.You will probably need another book after you finish with this book."
2,Incompatible with previous versions of Illustrator,"Don't buy this tutorial if you have a previous version of Illustrator. I have Illustrator 7, but this tutorial is constructed so that previous versions of Adobe Illustrator will not open the files on the tutorial CD. So you can't use it with anything except Adobe 8 or more. I looked on Adobe's website for technical support on this issue and could find nothing. It might be a wonderful tutorial, but if you have anything less that 8.0, you will need to find something else."
5,An excellent continuation of the reference started in Vol. 1,"This book is similar in every aspect to that of its predecessor, by the same author. As noted in my review of Vol. 1, this book has some contradictory information with Vol. 1. I am suprised to learn that these were the only two books in this series, which has a high quality factor."
3,"Good idea, if it had actually lasted the 10 years.","Like many others, I bought this with the idea that it'd be great not to have to change the battery every six months or so. 10 years sounded like a nice break from dragging out the foot stool. In my case though the low battery beep started today, 4 1/2 years into the 10 year period. While it was nice not having to change the battery in the meantime, I'm not sure I saved enough in replacement battery costs to cover the increased cost of this alarm.I did not experience the over sensitive issue that others have reported here. The alarm has remained quiet until today."
1,more like a 3 year battery,"Like others, I've found the claimed 10 year battery life to be quite shorter than advertised. My unit had a date of 2009. The battery started dying in fall of 2012."
1,10 year battery? I've had two die in less than 2 years,Like the subject line says:1) 10 year battery #1 was manufactured in 2007 and died in June 20092) 10 year battery #2 was manufactured in Feb 2009 and died in Jan 2010The first time I'd take as an exception. The second time means I'll never buy this again.
1,Too sensitive,"This thing will scream every time you take a shower, not from steam, but from the increased humidity. I had this in a bedroom down the hall from the bathroom. Even if I take a lukewarm shower with the exhaust fan running- the mirror doesn't even fog- once I open the bathroom door this thing starts screeching the song of its people. Last night I could smell the neighbor's barbecue grill- no smoke that I could see- this thing begins screeching. I hit the silence button, keeps screeching, pulled out the disable tab, keeps screeching, pry out the battery- finally stops. In the quest to create a sensitive alarm that awakens you early, First Alert has created a useless thing that constantly screams FIRE! in innocent circumstances."
4,"Works well, don't know the long term ...","This smoke detector was easy to install and appears to work well. It is convenient to have one button for test and silence; On my other units I often press the wrong button to silence the unit, but this is not a problem with this unit.The unit looks fine, although the writing on it is a bit bolder than I'd like. You'd like this unit to blend into the ceiling and the writing prevents that.Others appear to have long-term problems with the battery, but since I just installed the unit recently, I can't speak to that. I've had 10-year batteries fail after a few years on a different brand (Kidd) and they replaced it promptly. The way I see it, a 9V costs a few dollars and the price between this and a regular unit is only three batteries or so, so it only has to last 3 years to brake even."
5,A Must Read for Adults and Juvenile Readers,"Children of Plains Estates is a multicultural book that focuses on issues concerning juvenile readers. It is entertaining but also educates children on issues of concern including AIDS, racism,child molestation,drugs,and peer pressure. This is a rare book that examines not only childhood relationships but how parents confront their own issues of prejudice and social problems. This book is a must read for children and their parents. There are no solutions presented by the author. The reader must draw his or her own conclusions based on their own values. I highly recommend this book."
4,Great value!!,This is my second Invicta watch. I have ordered 3 more after this one (one for the wife). I do love the Invicta line. I will say that the band is a bit cheap feeling in comparison with my other watches. Perhaps it is also the weight difference as my other Invicta watches are very heavy. It does have a great look to it and does catch the eye of others.
5,A delightful verse that brings back memories from childhood.,"I had a copy of this book when I was about 7 or 8. I am now forty five and had searched high and low for this fabulous book for my daughter, who is now eighteen. I found one in one of our district's school library and had the priviledge of reading it in an assembly for Reading Week. I would love to get I copy of it for myself."
5,A classic. Read it once and you'll read it dozens of times.,"This is one of only a handful of books I treasure from my childhood. We have a torn, beat up copy that we read regularly."
5,Nice Little Book,I bought this for my grandchildren ages 1-8. They all enjoy reading it and hearing it read and looking at the pictures.
3,"The Movie is Fine, the Description is Not Complete","This refers to the double feature version containing both ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" and ""Hell Up in Harlem"".I purchased the older DVD with just ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" some years ago but was looking for a replacement with the correct aspect ratio, which is 1.85:1 per IMDb. From the description of this product, both here and elsewhere, it appeared to me that both films were available in both 1.33:1 and 1.85:1, a not uncommon occurrence.Unfortunately, this is not correct: the package labling clearly states that ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" is 1.33:1 and ""Hell Up in Harlem"" is 1.85:1.The film itself is great. I enjoyed when I read the book, when I saw the film at the time it came out, and I enjoy it every time I see it even in P&S.;I just wish the product description had been more precise."
3,More Interesting than Good,"This film might have been very funny when it first came out in 1970, but for recent audiences it's more interesting than good. Not much in the way of laugh-getting qualities. It is interesting to see the soon-to-be's that would later star in Black movies and TV shows of the 70s and having lived in Harlem for a while as a child in the early 70s, the locations bring back memories. But what i found fascinating (aside from watching that FINE Judy Pace) was Calvin Lockheart's portrayal of Deke O'Mally, which today looks like an ugly and eerily accurate prediction of Louis Farrakhan and other such leaders that were to come in the future."
3,Black Is Beautiful,"Mabel Robinson's cotton-bale dance near the end of the movie, is worth the price of admission all by itself. The movie as a whole is fun, and a great period piece."
2,a facsimile,"I was very disappointed upon receiving this item to realize it was a facsimile of a marked-up library copy. i knew something was up with the weird cover (not a US image). I feel completely ripped off, and would not have purchased it had I known."
4,A well organized and easy to use field guide to FL flowers,"This reference guide is nicely divided into 8 terrestrial communities: Pine Flatwoods, Sandhills and Clayhills, Scrubs, Temperate Hardwood Forests, Coastal Uplands, Rockland Pinelands, Rockland Hardwood Hammocks, and Ruderal Sites. Each community is described and further subdivided. The descriptions and pictures of the typical plants in each community are are good and nicely organized."
1,Not Very Helpful,"This book is very limited. You have to look at each page to ID the flower. Some pictures are not very clear, and some do not show the leaves. If the plant you look at is not excatly like the book's pix you can't be 100% sure of the plant's ID."
1,Unhappy,"I live on the Treasure Coast of Florida (between Sebastian and Hobe Sound) and up till now I relied on various websites to help me ID plants. Because this method of searching is very time consuming I thought it was time to invest in a field guide.Armed with 20+ plants already identified I used these as my starting point. My search through the index of this book concluded with 3 listings out of 20+ plants. Such low results are a tremendous disappointment!While time consuming, I will return to the internet for more current and accurate plant identifications."
2,"Bizarre and plotless, if creative","This is a novel unlike any I have ever seen, but having said that (and yes, it's creative and I am sure the author is smart and witty and interesting), it is also almost inscrutable. Only a teenager who cares about very minor soap-opera, self-absorbed sorts of little things will be able to tolerate this book. It's all little notes written on greasy paper bags and stuff like that. I think teens will enjoy the fact that it's about COLLEGE kids, but what an annoying group of people-who-think-they're-so cool. It's hard to take. I can't tell you how hard to read it is..."
5,Inventive!,"Inventive, touching, witty and just plain REAL! I work with teenagers everyday and this book does a remarkably good job of capturing their honest emotions and ""speech"" patterns... Usually YA lit falls short when trying to be ""hip"" to the current teenage culture but this one hits it right on the money. Terribly original yet a story that everyone will relate to. Keep it up, Hillary!"
4,Unique Read,"I first read this book when I was 14, I am now 19, and read it about 15 times since, and it has been in the hands of about 10 of my friends. I love this book. It is interesting how it is all threw passed notes. I love the game, I used to play it all the time with friends, I just do it by myself now. I truly love this book and recommend it, and I wish Hillary Frank wrote more books."
4,Page Turner,"Jake makes the decision to stop talking after he has fight with his best friend. During the fight he said some awful things that he can't take back. Jake thinks if he starts communicating in writing instead of talking, he will have more control of his words.I couldn't put this book down. I wondered what it would be like to communicate with written words only. Would Jake be able to survive in college with only written communication?This was a very interesting premise for a story and I enjoyed it very much."
4,Great story - not quite perfect Kindle edition,"This is one of my favorite Dorothy Sayers books -- really anything with Harriet Vane is at the top of the list -- but the Kindle edition has some significant typos. Not a ton... but at least one or two pointedly change the meaning of a sentence. If I hadn't read this book several times (dozens of times!) already, it would have been confusing."
2,Typos,"The low star value is for the Kindle version; the book itself is one of my favorites!But this Kindle version has an unconscionable number of typographical errors, considering the price."
3,Well written but convoluted,The story was a very interesting crimesolver type of novel. Parts of the solution were glossed over quickly leaving confusion and other parts were explained ad nauseum. The ideas and plot were good. The end came too quickly without a good summation/ conclusion to the story. It sort of left you hanging.
2,Good until the ending ruined it,"I was quite enjoying this lengthy book - both the mystery itself and the Vane/Wimsey interactions - right up to the last page or so when the abrupt, vague, disappointing, and out of character ending left me completely flat. It's almost as if the author got tired after 448 pages and just wanted to finish the story ASAP. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll leave it at that except to reassure that the mystery itself is solved; it's the *resolution* that's lacking.I've been reading the Lord Peter Wimsey stories in chronological order (and would rate nearly all of them so far as 4+ Stars). That's a good thing, because if this book had been my first Wimsey book, I'm not sure I would have read any further."
5,"""This could be considered as Federico Garcia Lorca's best work...""","This could be considered as Federico Garcia Lorca's best work, and is highlighted in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. The guide states, ""Considered to be Lorca's highest dramatic achievement, besides being one of the most well-known and dramatized works of the Spanish theater. The subtitle of the play is Drama of women in the villages of Spain. It focuses on the life of an Andalusian family in which the protagonist exercises a cruel tyranny over her five daughters. This drama explores the themes of repression, passion and nonconformity in a rural feminine world. It is worth noting the apparent simplicity of the work counterpoised against its enormous thematic complexity."""
3,the strougle for traditions,"this book is about a family all women who live in spain , and who fight family traditions, genertions, and woamns rights."
4,I like my set...,I like my set- I've picked up pieces over the years. The regular aquarius is what i started with- but I couldn't find it after 5 years- the replacement pieces I bought were from the Aquarius Satin set- that's where the differences come in. All have been going through the diswasher and look fine. No one really notices the slight differences in the two sets except me. This satin set I've had a few pieces of it now for 5 years and I have no complaints and find my set very attaractive and receive compliments onit all the time.
5,great new blues artist,I was very happy with this cd-great new artist playing the blues the way they should be played-hope to hear more from this riseing star-
5,Still Making History,"WOW!!! What a great album! Not only a superb singer and songwriting but an immense natural beauty... not to mention her virtuosic guitar skills. Ana Popovic is a singular talent and this, her US debut, is her finest work to date. She tackles issues such as politics, perserverance and more on this extremely eclectic album. One of the best surprises of this year, I would recommend this album to just about anyone. Ana Popovic's Still Making History is one of the finest pop/rock releases of the year and it proves Ana's potential for superstardom!!!"
5,Go see an Ana Popovic show !,Saw Ana at Misicfest in Bethlehem Pa. last month. She put on a great show and this is an excellent representation of what she can do. She puts a slightly different spin on the Blues-Rock genre. Highly recommended !
4,A lifesaver!,"Got this for my husband, who is vision impaired. It has freed him to again use the computer! The only thing we don't like about it: I am always lowering the volume, and he has a hard time seeing the volume buttons at the top of the keyboard. The nursing facility where I work has this, too, and it really benefits the residents."
3,the crystal is ball-shaped and too big,"The crystal pendant is a ball, instead of a slice, which makes it a little uncomfortable to wear."
5,"A VERY ""REAL"" ROMANTIC MOVIE!",Ouch! my little baboon's heart is breaking. One of the best romantic films I have ever seen. A very believable and realistic story with a great cast. The DVD has a very good transfer.
3,"A satisfying, old-fashioned love story","Slater, Tomei, and Perez are all very good in their roles, and the film's slow (but never boring) pace works very nicely. It's nothing amazing, but it's reminiscent of some of the older, classic Hollywood love stories from the 40s and 50s which I like very much. The only thing I really didn't like about the film was the occasional violence and profanity. I think it would have been more pleasant had there not been any of that. Otherwise, a pretty good movie."
5,Sad But I love it,This movie is such a good movie.its those kinds of movies where u see it and u cry then u think about it and u cry.I think what really nice is how he just opened up and told her how he felt and did all these really nice things for her just to see her happy.My favorite part is when she finds the christimas tree in her bedroom. Christian Slater plays such a heart touching person in this movie.... I really cant put into words how this movie is such a great movie. Its my frist romance movie that i loved and i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it...... I LOVE IT.
4,Untamed Heart,The movie was excellent. It's a good date movie because you are going to need a good shoulder to cry on.
1,Disc from the UK,"It should be noted to customers that if a DVD is being shipped from another country, it will not work in a DVD player made for use in the US. I assumed that since I was purchasing a movie sold on Amazon's US sight, even though the item was being shipped from the UK, it would be compatible with my DVD player. Unfortunately, it was not."
5,Beautiful!,I love this movie its so great a real heart to heart movie something so beautiful i have been wnating to but the DVD for years!!I cant wait till i recieve my DVDi plan on movie night! buy it!its greaattt
3,"Farfetched, yet riveting","Hardly likey, most of the story is preposteros, but it is a nice review of an Italian mixed up young lady in love. And once watching, I wanted to see what happened next."
4,A favorite kid-pick at my 2 year old daughter's daycare,"This book entrances the 2+ year olds in my daughter's daycare center with its beautiful, wordless illustrations. A peaceful, enchanting book that I wish were not out of print so we could enjoy our own copy at home!"
4,Great when used with the Five-in-a Row curriculum,"Otherwise, I don't think I would have gotten as much enjoyment from it! My daughter likes the book, and we play hide-and-seek with her yellow ball."
5,My son loves this book!,I am using this book with BFIAR (Before Five in a Row) and my son (3) adores it. We have read it four days in a row and each time he asks me to reread it at least three times. The first reading I was surprised by how engaged he was in this simple book. He was really worried about the ball for a while but overjoyed at the happy ending. We have really enjoyed this book and hope you do too!
3,"lots about Jung, less about Revelation","As the co-author of my own book on Revelation (""Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now"" [Orbis 1999]), I am always interested in new approaches to this ancient text. While Dr. Edinger was obvious an expert in Jungian psychology, his skills as a biblical exegete are wanting. His interpretation relies almost exclusively on his impressionistic reaction to the text from a Jungian perspective, and the eclectic interpretation of Revelation from scholar JM Ford, whose work has been strongly critiqued by scholars.If you are already a Jungian, you'll feel confirmed by this book. If you're looking for a reading of Revelation that respects both its historical and biblical contexts, look somewhere else."
5,Very relaxing,This tea is delicious and relaxing. It is the first tea I choose when I need a soothing moment. It has the perfect blend of flavor for a calming moment. I have been buying it for 5 years.
5,Outstanding Conservative Work on OT Evangelist,"Since Isaiah is so critical due to its vast array of Messianic passages and especially the Suffering Servant of ch. 53, it is vital to have and consult this reliable resource.In three volumes, Young provides vast background and contextual info to gaining an understanding of what the hearer heard back then, before moving to its NT fulfillment and application to the NT church.Young uses the historical-grammatical method and relies on typology.Rate this right up there with Keil-Delitzsch on this magnificent Evangelist of the OT."
5,Great book set,I am really enjoying this commentary on Isaiah. It contains lots of applications as well as great background material.
5,silver,"This set of books on Isaiah is for the serious student, but easy to under stand. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to understand more about Isaiah but has not been to seminary. You will be glad you invested in them."
4,Bend...The...Bones...,"wow what do we have here.. ""Hoodoo Talk"" reissued with bonus tracks in a beautiful digipak! after all these years, the monstrous techno-funk of ""Leather Hands"" still enthralls and terrorizes. the other bonus tracks ""Sugar Can You Feel The Drums?"" and ""Upbeat"" are both brilliant. recommended for anyone interested in Cabaret Voltaire circa ""The Covenant, The Sword And The Arm Of The Lord""."
2,Most of the content is outdated now,The book was published in 2000 and is specific to 1984 - 2004 twenty-year period. Skipped a lot of pages. Didn't find it useful except some tables that stay unchanged.From year to year Lillian updates her knowledge in Feng Shui and therefore it's better to buy her lately published books.Don't waste your timer and money on this one.
5,A Practical and Thorough Book!,"I used to think that feng shui was a bunch of,... well, crap. But after reading this book, I was wrong. You have to understand that everything is related to everything and that feng shui relates the physical to the spiritual. Once you realize that, then you will understand why Lillian Too's book on feng shui may be true. Now, this book can get technical, but it's very practical. I've changed my bed around and know how to have success in my life according to feng shui's tips. I was quite new to seriously learning about feng shui before I read this book. Now, I practice it in my daily life."
2,Not impressed upon arrival,"Functionally, I believe this tripod is usable. When I took the tripod out of the box it seemed used. There were markings on the legs and it seemed flemsy when I set it up. The winder also seemed very loose. Just not feelin' this tripod. Sending it back today."
4,These are Pretty Big,I had one of these in the smaller size and love it. I thought I was buying more of the same. I didn't read the dimensions. These are about the size of a piece of computer paper. Just make sure that's what you want before you buy. They are a great box though!
3,No detailed examples or answers.,"This workbook supplements the Varian textbook, Intermediate Microeconomics. The textbook focuses on the conceptual and this workbook focuses on the mathematical applications of microeconomics. There are numerous problems for each chapter that range from easy to difficult. Unfortunately, the workbook only has the even answers in the back and no explanations for the answers. I believe that the workbook would be extremely valuable if only it had explanations for the answers. Instructors using the workbook do have the detailed explanations to the questions."
1,This book is confusing and not an adequate study guide,"The textbook was hard enough to follow. The workbook, although it provides exercises, does not furnish the student with any explanation of how the answers were derived"
1,mistakes and very simple,"I completely agree with what everyone else has said especially, ""waste of time, I don'tknow what else to say."" It was extremely simple and did have many errors. If you want to check your math microeconomics understanding, buy a copy of Shaum's outlines for Mathematics for Economists."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!,"This book is a joke. Literally. I think the authors are trying to see how stupid professors are: if a prof assigns this workbook, they slap their knees in laughter. No questions are practical they're all highly unimaginative and awkward. It makes you wonder how Varian is even popular. The guy is a sub-par economist at best."
3,Decent Homework Tool,"I bought this book to accompany the textbook. While helpful with several answers and problems, graph explications are lacking in the text and as answers in the back. Otherwise, a great homework book!"
2,Disappointing,"As an avid Alan Rickman fan, I was excited about this movie because the plot line sounded interesting. As the movie went on, the plot was fairly predictable. I believe that the writers noticed this flaw also and tried to spice up the ending. When the movie ended, I was left gaping at the screen in confusion. I think that any Alan Rickman fan should definitely try it because he definitely offers a strong performance, but be warned about the ending."
3,Completely forgettable non-thriller,"The Bottom Line:Its presence on FearNet notwithstanding, Dark Harbor is much more of a character-based drama than a thriller, so be aware of that going in; that said, it's a rather slow film whose surprise ending doesn't redeem 90 minutes of relative tedium and non-existent tension, so maybe we should just stop worrying about its genre and skip it altogether.2.5/4"
3,Love and Hate... Oh how to Choose,"Well, Dark harbor was a.... lets say.... wait. I rented it the first time I saw it and while in the car looking down at the case I guessed the ending. LOL! And well, at the time I didn't know I had. So that night as my girlfreind and I snuggled our pillows and watched it, we found our selves half watchin though the moive up until the End. And that was it the selling point of the movie. I love Alan Rickman and the ended just tyed the knot on the almost stakerest way I like him.Now if you have a short attention span...this moive may not be for you. And yet if you are a Rickman lover, you will beable to sit though this moive, until the end.**Spoiler**Now this is a heed of warning there is slash in this moive I shall not tell between who. But if you desest those things this movie is MOST NOT FOR YOU!"
3,twisted thriller,If you are a Alan Rickman fan and you like thrillers you might enjoy this. The ending was a surprize and leaves you wondering.
2,Explain the phenomenon!,"Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a ""nude scene"" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off."
2,From the Ocean,"Alan Rickman does a fine job of being a perfect jerk of a husband, but outside of his great performance, the movie lacks interest. The movie could have had potential, but seems cut-up and fragmented in parts that just don't make sense or play well with the story line. Those who think they are great at guessing the end of a movie before it's over will have a challenge and a surprise here. If I had viewed this before purchase, it would never had made it to my personal library."
3,Dark Harbor,"Was an interesting twist on the drifter, love triangle story line. This one is not for those looking for the typical love story themed movie. And not for those who are steeped in the safe haven of normal thinking. The ending left me rewinding to make sure that I had seen the ending properly. Sometimes the mind is not as quick as the eye and this one definitely left me thinking about whether things are really as we perceive them to be."
4,Alan Rickman fan service.,"Having not the faintest idea what this movie was I about, I rented it merely due to the fact it stars the illustrous and very sexy Alan Rickman. However, I soon found it was a many layered and sensual film, falling into the pyschological thriller genre I've come to enjoy. It plays out like a M. Night Shyamalan film, keeping the viewer confounded up until the very ended, and perhaps afterwards, assuring they'll watch it again the catch the tell-tale signs. Alan is enough reason to rent it, but the movie itself is worth buying."
3,don't watch the end,"I admit I rented the movie so I can watch Alan Rickman. Just stare at him. Which I did and was very entertained by him. I wasn't sure why he was trying for an American accent because his wife didn't have one. But it was fun watching him try. The problem is that it would have made a better romance than a thriller. If they cut out the stalker completely, I'd have given this five stars.The ending will have me in therapy for a while, I'll admit. There's an excellent nude shot of Rickman hopping off a boat. But, really, once you see the naked boat scene, turn it off because the last scene is disturbing for all you people out there who fantasize about the man. Please tell me the actor did NOT do what they showed him do. I think it was a camera trick but it grossed me out just the same.Good rental. Bad purchase."
5,Very well thought out,"This was a very good short. I love the way it shows how George Lucas got all of his ideas about how he wrote starwars. The cast was very good also, who ever played Yoda I think did a fantastic job, I thought that was the best part of the movie.Oh and no, I am not a Starwars fan at all, even if you've only seen bits and pieces of starwars this movie is hilairious. I dont think I ever sat through the whole starwars movie before and I thought this was great.If you are a big fan of Austin Powers you should get this one too. Evil Hill was a good one too. Swing Blade was even better. But I did not like Film Club, I thought it was kind of stupid but there was some funny stuff in there."
1,Nine minutes of my life I'll never get back,"I wanted to like this movie. Really I did. But as many others also discovered after viewing, I found this movie to be hackneyed and sloppy. A few character references and superficial nods to Star Wars does not a good short make. Mr. Nussbaum should be thanking cinematographer Eric J. Haase for AT LEAST making this short look good. Other than that, it was a total dud. Typical example of rich kids with expensive toys -all of the resources, nothing interesting to say."
5,High quality film short,"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of ""Shakespeare in Love"" featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school. This film is less than 10 minutes long, but manages to cram joke after joke in, alluding to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not limited to the STAR WARS films).The filming, acting, and score is superb. My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough. I also feel like the script could have used a little more polish. However, this short film is a fun and diverting fantasy, adding another dimension of folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its much-revered creator."
4,"Great, but DON'T LOOK AT THE BOX BEFOREHAND","This is a very enjoyable 9-minute movie, and you don't have to be a diehard Star Wars fanatic to enjoy it. You just have to have seen the 3 initial movies. The price is a bit high ($12 including shipping), but worth it if you'll split the price with some friends. After all, Blockbuster doesn't have it.BUT, don't look at the box or talk with people about it before watching it. Remember, it's only 9-minutes long. There are lots of scenes on the box that you'll find quite funny in the movie if you're NOT already anticipating them. Don't lose the fun of half the movie by seeing half the jokes beforehand."
3,A little disapointing,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. I bought this excited to add some amazing Star Wars humor to the collection. I had heard only good things about it. At times I did laugh out loud. Particularly at George's rival a very Darth Vadery like character. But I think the rest of the shot film was sub-par. It was so very close to being good but JUST missed it. You also get several other short films. One is about Dr. Evil, one is ""Film Club"" a parody on Fight Club, and one is Swing Blade. The Dr. Evil one was ok but the other two were pretty lame. Over all I think these films are more ""downloading off the internet"" quality than DVD quality."
4,Additional features,"Get this disc not only for the amusing title featurette, but for the additional included items - especially the Sling Blade/Swingers parody, which is the funniest."
4,Quality short film,"I saw this film in English class a couple days ago because my eccentric and wonderful sophmore english teacher had Dowling, a creator of the film, a couple years ago. His sister is currently at Wellesley High School. This film is very creative, and quite humorous to even non Star Wars fans. I was surprised to find it here...it is reasonably steep for a 9 minute spoof. However, for star wars buffs, or people who want to share it with friends, this is a worthwhile purchase."
4,Just Fun!,"I loved George Lucas In Love...I thought it was clever and fun. As a person who grew up with Star Wars, I admire George Lucas' creativity, but I'm not obsessed with the Star Wars trilogy and/or Episode 1. I do, however, admire this video for the same reasons I liked Space Balls--it's just FUN.Why does everything have to be so serious these days to be considered a 'great film'? George Lucas In Love, to me, is a great film short. Enjoy it for what it's worth!"
2,"Mildly entertaining, but disappointing - not worth buying","Probably just because of all the hype about it, when I finally got a chance to see it (on the Sci-Fi channel's ""Exposure"" show) I ended up only finding it fair at best. It's basically one very simple joke told repeatedly. This isn't a terrible thing as the film was so short, but surely something much better and much funnier could have been achieved with the same idea.My recommendation is that you watch it before buying. You may, like me, not see what all the hype is about."
2,"One of the star's for music, one for cinematography...","Unfortunately cinematography and music are really all there is to this short. The rest was soulless and pretty weak comedy. The film has nowhere near the passion of ""Hardware Wars,"" etc., and the comic moments are highly repetitious (they have to be because of the ""idea"" behind the short, I guess, but that doesn't mean it's enjoyable). But I did enjoy the way the cinematography and music danced around both films they are spoofing, and the actors were decent, so I give it a 2.Don't fall for the hype.X, the Unknown"
2,Not what I expected,"I should have known there was a reason for the low price. I had no idea it was a collection of short films. The title short, ""George Lucas in Love"" was 4 stars... the other shorts were not the least bit funny. I was very disappointed."
5,This one hits the mark,"As with any short-subject work, you need to get right to the point in a hurry, without losing the viewer. This leaves the viewer laughing, and eager to watch again and again. This will certainly join my video collection. The best!"
3,George Must Have Enjoyed This Himself.,"This DVD is fun. Not the best of all the Star Wars Satires I have seen, but certainly on of the few that focuses on George Lucas and his universe.Done to the tone of ""Shakespeare In Love"", this movie has cute moments, Star Wars inuendos and some clever diaglogue. The performances are very good too.It's cute. For the Die Hard - Star Wars fan this is a must. Be warned, its very short!"
5,The funniest 8 minute short ever!,"""George Lucas in Love"" is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen. What if George Lucas, the creator of the ""Star Wars"" movies, had a muse, like ""Shakespeare in Love"" suggests that the Bard did? Well, imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC, struggling to create a short picture. And then the fun begins. This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes. I've watched it over a dozen times, and each time I see another joke that I missed before."
4,Only 9 minutes,"This was extremely entertaining for me as I am a huge Star Wars fan, but beware it is only 9 minutes in length. As long as you go in with that expectation, I'm sure you will find this to be an enjoyable short film. You also get 3 other shorts on the disc, but they are all less than 10 minutes in length. Evil Hill was far less entertaining than I had hoped."
2,WHAT IN THE WORLD?,"I have seen this short and am very confused why it is the number one seller. It lasts for a very short while nothing ever happens. It is a boring film project by boring film students that think they are very clever. The actors, director, writer and editor should be shot on site. This is not a good short it is not worth your time please I beg you DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. Do not keep it number one. For the love of God please just say no."
2,Just not very amusing,"I'm sorry, I just felt like this flick was one joke told again and again for about twenty minutes. I think it would be more amusing as a concept you share with your friends at a bar one evening, but as a completed short film...you should probably borrow it, as opposed to renting or buying."
2,What's the big deal?,"""In my experience there's no such thing as luck.""Well, Obi-Wan, apparently you haven't seen ""George Lucas In Love"", a shoddy one-note parody that SOMEHOW has fooled people into thinking it's brilliant. Jar Jar was funnier."
5,a brilient masterpiease,this movie was simply breath takingnot only was it fnny but it inspiers if you never seen this movie yougot to by it
5,Susan O.,"This tea is the best. I love mint tea, and when I saw this tea had mint and tarragon I thought I'd give it a try. It really is amazing. Very refreshing-- a must try."
5,Great tea,My family loves this tea -- it is refreshing and tasty! It is especially good over ice on a hot summer's day.
3,"Good, not great","Though this was an enjoyable and educational book, I must admit I ended up a little disappointed. It just seemed to me like the author was trying to hard at times. I had hoped that the physics (though used for great allegorical effect) would be better integrated into the plot, as Mawer did with genetics in Mendel's Dwarf. Relativity, etc., is really fascinating stuff-- the author should have perhaps given us more credit for being able to understand it beyond the most simple explanations. I also felt that the story just went on to long. After the critical events, the book really lost narrative and emotional momentum. Despite these criticisms, I did find the book a touching, worthwhile story. The disappointment comes because it seemed like the book could have been so much more."
2,Hard to villify a hero...,"I agree totally with the writer from SC--if you decide to villify a personality that has reached such a positive iconic status in our culture, you better be able to back it up with some real emotions as motivators. The writer does not."
2,I played it once and no more,"I bought this game because I love college sports and thought a college basketball game would be great. I played NCAA Football 2002 which was perfect. So I thought it would have some resemblance to the college greatness of NCAA Football 2002 (I love that game). After 1 shot you will realize you can easily nail 3 point shots with a 7 foot center. The graphics are horrible, the players move like Super Nintendo, and worst of all they don't even have the real players numbers (which they do in ncaa football). The recruiting is horrible and so is the rest of the game. Save your money, don't buy it."
3,Combine Them,I want to make a suggestion to either EA sports or 989. Combine March Madness 2002 with Final Four 2002 and you would have the perfect college basketball game. March Madness has the best graphics and gameplay but no season or dynasty mode. Final Four does. Overall this game was ok but next year make it with better graphics and better gameplay.
3,Good but not great,"The game is fun, the gameplay okay, but the graphics s[tink]. The people look like they all had ... defects, and sometimes I can't even look at them. If you turn the difficulty all the way up its fun."
3,Not as bad as some people say.,"This game has poor graphices, and when I first bought it, it was my first game for Playstion 2 so I didn't know right off how much better graphices could get.Still it remaind compelling(as you would expect from a basketball game) and you get plenty of teams to chose from.I would still rent this instead ... ."
2,"Too slow, too boring","The graphics are good, but the game has no excitement at all. It's probably some what realistic, but if I wanted real basketball I wouldn't have bought a video game. The moves are boring and the game is slow."
1,This is the worst game ever made.,"It looks awful, the gameplay is awful, the sound is awful. Just a horrible game."
2,Disappointed,"This book came to me with a strong recommendation but I was surprised by how much I disliked it. The characters were flat and the dialogue was boring. I found myself skimming along trying to get to the ""good part"" - but it never came. I finished it but I'm wondering why others thought it was so wonderful."
4,Very Good Book,"This was a great book and the writing in it was beautifully done. I liked to story and the characters. The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me is because the ending just left me hanging there. It wasn't an ending, it just ended."
2,An Expected Disappointment,"Against my better judgement, I decided to use up some of my time reading this book. I received the book as a gift from someone I respect and the author is local, so I thought I would give it a read. Unfortunately, the author's work lived up to what I think must be typical of Oprah's Book Club works. It is extremely maudlin and has clunky and obvious plot devices. The author has some technical skill, and that is what merits the 2-star rating. Amazingly, this version actually has an appendix with suggested areas for discussion. This is quite pretentious.Don't waste your time with this one. Read some Faulkner or Sherwood Anderson and give this one to your grandmother."
2,Gap Creek,"A very sad, depressing book. Granted it makes you appreciate the things you have in life more but who needs to be brought down by someone's continuous hardships. I kept waiting for something positive to happen; it just kept getting more depressing. Life is difficult enough; read the newspaper to get depressed. Read a novel to escape, be enlightened, and dream."
3,Think Twice,"At first, I found this book to be uplifting. Beautifully written, descriptive,yet not too wordy. I was in the mountains with Julie and was ready to gut a hog myself (okay, maybe a fish). Then, I soon came to realize that her life was not getting any easier, ever! It's an easy read and you'll finish quickly, but you won't feel so good once you are done. I found it all rather depressing in the end."
4,"Simple, but interesting","I enjoyed reading this book. It reminds me of stories from my grandparent's, and things that needed to be done to survive hard times. He accurately described about slaughtering hogs, rendering lard, and dressing chickens, things that are still done today in rural areas. Julie was an interesting character, with much strength and determination. Although she was uneducated, she had much wisdom and faith, and was able to work through her many challenges. It was written in such a way that you could feel yourself experiencing the emotions Julie was feeling. I hope there will be a sequel to it."
3,Wonderful writing wrapping a so-so story,"This first-person tale of a young backwoods farm woman and her husband around the turn of the century is a well written slice-of-life -- as it might have been.Morgan's ear for dialect and turn of phrase make for interesting reading as do his detail in describing the hard-wearing daily life of the mountain poor in the late 1800's. But it's a depressing tale, filled with one one woe after another, and not enough plot development and progression in story or character. For some, the skill and quality of the writing will be enough, but for those who prefer character development and plot, read elsewhere."
2,Just Kind of ... Dull,"Like many others here, I read this because it was an ""Oprah book."" I'll give the author credit for detailed descriptions of what the characters had to do to survive ... killing hogs, giving birth unassisted, tending burns and laying out the dead, etc. ... but this book is strongly lacking in any emotional connection to its characters. Not to sound like an acting coach, but ""where is the motivation?"" If Morgan's intent was to show Julie to be a simple, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth young woman, he succeeded (for me) in portraying only the ""simple"" part of that equation. She was nothing more than an automaton, getting through each day by moving from one chore to the next. Where was her heart through all this, where was her soul? Vivid descriptions, one-dimensional characters, weak dialogue. I can only give this book 2 stars."
2,Dull and depressing,"I agree with another reviewer that there really wasn't a story in this novel. I appreciated (can't say I enjoyed them) the depictions of mountain life at the turn of the century and there were some passages that I thought were well written, but the plot went nowhere. When I got over half way through the book and realized that nothing had really happened to the characters (and wasn't going to, based on the remaining number of pages in the book), I just skimmed the last few chapters and called it a day. There is no story, no real growth (unless you count Hank learning not to lose his temper character growth), and no emotional payback for the litany of calamities that happen to Julie. I don't see the point of this book - and I really don't see how it ended up on Oprah's booklist. I don't recommend it."
3,"A simple, easy read","I had been eyeing this book for months before fnally getting my hands on it and reading. I have to say it was extremely simple reading; I zipped thru the pages quickly. I am not sure if we are supposed to believe that Julie, a young woman who was assuming a role in her family that was not congruent with the times, turned into the little homemaker wife with Hank.At times I didn't believe Julie would have thought the way she did in her situations, but at the same time I did feel for her. She was so young and faced many challenges. She annoyed me in her ways with Hank, making excuses for his behavior which is so typical of women that are abused. And then she proved her strength again with birthing alone.If you are looking for a light read, I recommend this. Just beware you may not believe a lot of what is told."
2,the worst 'Oprah' pick yet,"This novel describes a series of events in the life of a turn-of-the-century woman, but does so very disjointedly and without purpose. The lack of depth of the characters leave the reader unmoved by the struggles encountered. If you are looking for an 'Oprah' pick, I recommend 'The Book of Ruth' or 'White Oleander'."
2,Is that all?,"For all of the press that this novel has received I had built myself up for a good read. I began this book on a 4 hour flight and finished it before landing thinking ""This is it?"" Good story but underdeveloped and shallow. Ending left me wholly unsatisfied. A good read but nothing to write home about."
3,No identification with characters,"I was more disappointed in retrospect than when reading this book. I was certain that all the hardships endured by Julie would lead to a more insightful view of her true character, which never happened with her or any of the other characters. I would recommend it to others with reservations since it is more a recounting of the hardships of that life than how strength evolved from dealing with hardship. I had no more idea at the end of the book what kind of a person the husband was than I did at the beginning. It is a quick, but not a memorable, read."
4,Julie and Hank's first year!!!,"Gap Creek is the 14th Oprah book I've read so far. Ienjoyed this book of a couple's first year of a marriage. The reason it didn't get five stars was because of the writing. I know that the main character was supposed to be shown as a hillbilly, but writing like this gets on my nerves. And I fearthat I'll lose my knowledge of proper English.Julie moves away from her mother and three sisters to begin a life with her husband. This book is plagued by misery, but if you can withstand that, you'll find this book a good read.This reviewer gives Gap Creek by Robert Morgan4 stars:)"
2,Gap Creek,"I'm afraid I agree with the review of September 10, 2001 ""Reviewer: p.burton from Chesapeake, VA"". I bought the CD version and kept hearing ""I said"", ""mama said"", ""papa said"", ""Hank said"", ""Mrs. Richards said"", etc. At some point I forgot about the story and began waiting for the the next ""said"" to clomp down like a heavy boot. Eventually they became irritating and I had to finish listening to it in small bits over a few days.The problem was compounded by the reader's same monotone reading of the ""I/he/she said"" words. They were almost detached from the rest of the words. I also had a little trouble relating to or believing Julie's description of her feelings, etc. I think the problem might be a male author trying to write from a female perspective. I saw the author during a television interview and was really looking forward to the book. I think he has some interesting tales to tell but I was disappointed in this one."
5,One of the best books i have read...Wonderful.,"What more can i say, but I enjoyed this book immensly. It was so well written it was like I was right there at Gap Creek. I have loaned this book to several people and I have gotten the same response from everyone, ""Couldn't put it down"", ""Loved It"", ""One of the best books I have ever read"". Read this book, you will not be disappointed."
4,i had to keep reading it,I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. Even though I wish there was more happiness and good luck in this young couples life - I was completely engrossed!
3,Captivating But No Story,"I have to say that I read this book in two days. I was captivated by it but at the end, I really didn't feel like it was a storyline worth pursuing. I think the author was a good story teller because he did keep my interest, but I think he could have made the book more eventful. I wouldn't particularly recommend this book to anyone else. Sorry!"
1,Whoa there,"""The horse stepped sideways and he hollered,'Whoa there'."" (page 35) Would that I, instead of the horse, had obeyed Hank's command at this point in the book. Unfortunately, I labored on to end, enduring all too much more of this same type of captivating dialog."
2,Way tooo much suffering for a nickle!,"This book is wonderful for those of us that think suffering is a way of life. And in this case the author loads you down with suffering. There is much to be desired in the development of characters. There were a few interesting tidbits on farm life at the turn of the last centry, but this is the best I say about the book."
3,A good read,"Julie is a teenager who works hard on the fields, marries Hank, moves to Gap Creek, and continues to work as if there was no tomorrow.The marriage is constantly challenged by natural disasters, poverty, and personal tragedies. One of the main reasons I liked this book is the prose. The prose is delightful; the reason might be because the author is also a poet. For instance, Julie's description of her first night after the wedding is colorful: ""All the colors started running through my head in the dark. Purples and greens and yellows and black. They blended into each other and poured over each other.""The only portions I disliked were details of the gruesome tasks that Julie has to perform, and, I just skipped the instructions on butchering a hog. Overall, this book is an enjoyable read with interesting characters and vivid description of Julie's struggle to keep her marriage alive."
4,A Masterpiece,"Let's just say that this is definitely not ""beach reading"" material, unless you like to visit the hardships and sorrows of a young mountain woman in a rough marriage while you soak in some rays. But don't let that put you off. Robert Morgan is a master storyteller.This story about the complications and intimacy of marriage is nothing short of riveting. I came away feeling a strange sort of kinship with Julie (I want to meet her!) Wow, what a woman! She is remarkable, in a quiet sort of way, and although she is uneducated and inarticulate, it didn't take long for her to earn my respect.Again, this is not your usual cozy ""pleasure"" book, but it is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read. This is the type of book that immerses you fully during its duration and then haunts you lovingly long after you put it down. Don't miss this experience. It grabs you and doesn't let go.Male or female, I recommend it highly.Cris"
3,Interesting yet completely depressing,"Gap Creek is the story of a young couple's life in the beginning years of their marriage. Not only does practically everyone they know die, the couple is poor, unhappy, cold, and taken advantage of throughout the story. It would have been fine if it weren't so depressing. Robert Morgan did do an excellent job of telling the story through the female's point of view. Other than that, the story really did not have a point. I do not recommend this book if you are looking to be inspired or cheered up."
3,A little monontonous,"Even though I have to say I liked the book, I did alot of times find myself skipping down the page due to repetative descriptions of taters. I kept waiting for something to happen and was a little tired of reading ""I fixed taters and grits for dinner"" over and over. The description of every single meal just got old. However, it is a story that makes you think how hard life was, how death was so much a part of everyday life and the strength it took to not live but just survive. A good book if your looking for something with not too much depth to it that you can read in two evenings."
3,"A fast read, interesting but far from ""a masterpiece""","Narrated by the main character Julie, the story shows us the first year of a young couples marriage and the difficult situations they find themselves in and how they learn to cope. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was a fast read and there was always something interesting going on. It never got bogged down in sappy insight or rambling prose. There was no real resolution though and I found the drastic turn-around of some of the characters (i.e. Hank and Ma Richards) to seem somewhat rushed and a bit too ""neat"". Robert Morgan did a pretty good job of getting inside a womans head to tell this tale. However, the romantic situations (the first kiss and marriage bed scenes), in my opinion, did nothing for the story. I found it unbelievable that two very young people could be that uninhibited or sure of themselves. I highly doubt that this 17 year old virgin would be given to psychedelic visions."
5,Pleasing to my heart,"Gap Creek is the second book I have read by Robert Morgan and I although it isn't my usual style of ""pleasure reading"" I absolutly enjoyed it. I am a wife and mother myself, and my reading time is just before bed when no one is tugging at me, and during my day I would find my self waiting impatiently for bed time so I could travel back to Gap Creek and visit with Julie and Hank... This book is one of the best. The reader is going through the same emotions as the characters with every turn of the page. I not only felt, but Mr Morgan, with his unique style, allowed me to see this story play out so vividly. I laughed at the town drunk, I hated Ma Richards along with Julie, and mourned the losses and truimphed the gains. Gap Creek is an experience, you will not soon forget. It is such a beautiful true to life story without sugar coating, but mostly it is a triumph about doing what is right.. Gap Creek is pleasing to the heart."
2,Disappointing,"Of all the great books for Oprah to select, why this one? To discuss a book in the setting of a bookclub there must be something to discuss. In this book there is virtually nothing to discuss. I read this book in about three hours. My nine year old perhaps would have enjoyed it more than I did as it is about at her reading level. Most of Oprah's picks I find to be on the depressing side but after reading ""Gap Creek"" I felt nothing but anger that I had wasted my money on the book. I knew no more of impoverished lives in turn of the century Appalachia when I finished the book as I did when I began. Truly one of her worst picks to date."
2,A sad story,"I just recently finished reading Gap Creek, and though it was an easy read, I never actually liked the story. I could easily tell that it was a man writing Julie's feeling and thoughts. I never found her to be real. Her senses, especially smell, were well described. When it came to descriptions of her feeling I feel they were superfical and minimal. Falling in love is something girls, especially 17 year old girls, spend all day thinking about, but Julie's feelings were never really shared with us. Her life was difficult and she is a hard worker - that is brought out over and over again - though we all knew that from the first page. I wish Morgan spend more time inside her head and her feelings and less time saying the same things over again. At the end of the story I still did not really like Julie or Hank or their marriage. I will not be reading any more of Morgan's books."
2,Ho hum..........,"A great book if you enjoy yawning.... VERY low KEY! A most lengthy 'prologue' possibly for a good story but was not found within this one. The only sparks came near the end of the story when lost 'treasure' was found, but alas, too late to add body to Gap 'Creek'."
4,Oprah's Book Club,"A very good book. I was a interesting book, one I didn't feel the need to keep reading but I couldn't put it down. I would like to see another book (second one) about the some lead person. I really want to know what happened to her and her family."
3,Not too sure about listening to this on audio.,"I know it was supposed to be indicative of the person's dialect and lack of education, but listening to the first person account of a life told through short, choppy, simple sentences got old, real fast. I will, however, give major kudos to Jill Hill (the reader)! She did a fantastic job of making me feel like I was actually listening to Julie (the protagonist) telling her story. So, for that aspect alone, I would recommend the audio version. But, overall, I feel like I would've enjoyed the story more had I just read the book."
2,was the author suicidal?,"If you are looking for a book that starts out making you want to jump off a roof and ends the same way, this is just the thing. Depressing. That is really the only way to describe this book. This is not coming of age or life lesson learned type material. This is ""there is no way this much crap could happen to one person"" material. I will surmise the plot: woman...unlucky...woman..upset...unlucky, upset woman...end of book. Save yourself the pain."
2,Too many descriptions,"The story was okay, but it kept getting slowed down by overly-detailed descriptions of the household tasks. For example, when Julie did the laundry it went on-and-on-and-on about gathering the clothes, fetching the water, boiling the water, shaving the soap, stirring the clothes, etc. Then the details of butchering the hog went on for pages. It was 100 years ago, so I didn't expect her to have Whirlpool appliances. But I was getting exhausted, having to do all of that housework with her."
1,I want my money back.,"I'm not a professional book reviewer, but this book was terrible. The characters are just empty shells. It bumps along from one scene to another without any reason. I had a huge problem with the portrayal of domestic violence as foreplay. He belts her a couple of times and it makes her want to have sex with him? It just amazed me that the author would place this young woman into a terribly abusive relationship and then describe how glorious her sex-life was with her sniveling, gutless husband. I guess sex sells...at least it sold the legions of people who only buy what Oprah tells them to buy. This was the 1st and last book I'll buy based on Oprah's opinions. Shame on me."
2,Gap Creek,"I have just finished Gap Creek and felt compelled to write a review. I read it because of Oprah selecting it and it had very good reviews. I read a lot of books and I can't for the life of me understand why this one was chosen by Oprah or why the reviews were so good! It didn't seem to have any real plot and all it talked about was hard work and food. I don't know what I missed. I like it when Oprah selects books that have the potential for a real discussion of ideas and opinions like Map of the World. I just finished reading The Pact by Jodi Picoult and thought it ws wonderful and had so much more to think about it. I would love to see Oprah select that or Barbara Kingsolver's Pigs in Heaven. Oh well, just my opinion. Will check back to see how others feel. Happy reading to all!"
2,This book bummed me out!,"If you're into books where nearly nothing good happens, this is the book for you. If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, this is another book that will splendidly bring you down and depress you. Nothing happy or good happens to poor Julie, the main character in the book. The story is well-written in a simple, concise manner. While the writing is ""neat,"" the story is simply a downer. If you're looking for something to pick you up, don't pick this one up."
5,Beauty's painful truth,"Robert Morgan creates an unlikely heroine. Written in diary form or stream-of-consciousness, the beauty of this novel is it's accurate depiction of life experienced by a poor, uneducated young girl in rural South. I find myself grieving for her and envying her at the same time. I envy her honesty, stamina, and sensible competence."
3,Slow start,"Stating out slow and ending with a ""can't put down"". Having to force myself to read the first few chapters only to become so engrossed in the book not wanting to put it down until finished."
2,"Nice details, but boring plot","The scenary and the feelings of each character were nicely descriptive,but the story was plain out boring. All the bad things that happened seemed to occur for such a dumb reason and left me exasperated. It also made marriage seem horrible and hopeless."
3,Just read first 52 pages,"After the first 52 pages it's a steep downhill departure in quality of the novel. This book has little or no closure at the end regarding this story. Their mariage over the rest of the book(past 52 page) is just a constant series of major disasters to this married couple. The number of disasters is odd and too many to make any sense. There is little deve;lopment of chaacters after the first 52 pages. Read as library book only, may be good for teenages."
2,Descriptive but not enough,"While the author was able to describe the scenery and the actions going on, he was unable to describe the relationship between Julie and Hank. After Julie gave birth to their first child I wanted to know the emotions involved between the couple. After the death I also wanted to know the reactions from both sides towards each other. The author need to share the emotions of these two characters in order to grip my attention and make me think about the book long after putting it down. Oprah has made some wrong choices in books, but Gap Creek can not even compare to the emotions expressed in A Map of the World. I was expecting a similar book to Map of the World, feeling every emotion of the character, instead I was able to vision the scenery and work more than anything. I was very disappointed in this book. If you want a quick read without getting involved with the characters then you might enjoy the book, otherwise I would pick something else."
2,Laura Ingalls meets Foxfire,"I admire Oprah for introducing the average TV watcher to the joy of a good book. However, this is only a so-so book. It is leagues ahead of the 'heaving bosom' genre, but it isn't great literature. The characters were thinly developed and the story line predictable. Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books are a better choice for descriptions of pioneering spirit. If you want to learn about hog butchering and hardtimes-read the Foxfire series. These are the true stories gathered from interviews with the residents of the NC/SC/GA border area."
3,Gap Creek,"Not what I expected. Book was slow starting, did not pick up much speed and ended without closure. There were parts that I found interesting, but I would not recommend this book."
2,A touching exploration of emotional need ...,"... and I could care less. Louis Lamour taught me to be the man that I am, not twig-curling goofball silliness like this. Come on: who's life wasn't hard at the turn of the century? Just about no one's. This pap makes me want to puke."
1,A touching exploration of emotional need ....,"... and I could care less. I learned everything I needed to know about being a man from Louis Lamour, not twig-curling, whimpering pap like this.And let's face facts: life was hard for everyone at the turn of the century. We just this stuff because we think life is hard for us. Ha!Gap Creek? How about Pap Creek."
2,This is an emotional thrill ride!,"Why is it that at every election season, we hear the same reviews about the same pencils. I think that it is time we stand up to our Canadian opressers, and say nay! We must revenge! Why oh why is it that we are ruled by Cats? Did we lose a war? My father used to say that if you get your hand stuck in a bear trap, you should always appoligise to him for setting it off. My father always loved me, though I never knew the man. My moms told me he was killed in a war the day I was born, but I hink they killed him and burried him under the porch to quench their love. Oh man, I need a drink."
