2,crap,"The Author goes into extensive detail and tends to go on and on and on. Its definitely not a light read and its very hard to follow. The diagrams are not labeled very well and rather simple and stupid. Definitely not a good resource book or to keep forever. He doesn't explain things in black and white and tends to drift off on tangents in which you get lost in. I loved the class but hated the book. The book could have been written a lot clearer and to the point. If you don't have a PhD, good luck."
2,There's just not much to it,"My girls love the flip-a-face books, especially Big Little. This one was a little dissapointing because it's SO basic and every other page just has a blank face. It migh be good for babies 6-9 months but my one year olds were bored before I even got to the third page. They haven't looked at it since."
5,Great Baby Shower gift!,"I gave a set of these as Baby Shower gift because I wanted something the older sister(4 years) could ""read"" to the new baby. Everyone loved them"
5,Well written and easy to follow,I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to regain control of their life and increase their energy. The program is easy to understand and simple to follow. With easy to follow exercises this book is a must have for anyone who needs more energy to keep up with today's busy lives.
4,"Fabulous stories, decent translation.","If you like stories that have stood the test of time -- 1,300 years, that is -- then this collection is for you. Anyone familiar with these stories knows that these are some of the greatest stories for reading aloud, or, better, for retelling. One day I hope to find a translation that is both contemporary English and mindful of the original tone of the stories. It's hard to imagine any kind of highfalutin language being used in a story about a dead hunchback, but that's not altogether absent from this collection. Surely there exists somewhere a translation of these stories that is absolutely true to the spirit of the stories. While not perfect, this translation is pretty close to that. It's certainly worth having in your collection. Maybe something better will come along, but then again, probably not."
4,"good, easy reading","I liked it, I was told I missed out on some of the best parts because it doesn't have the narrative in between the stories."
3,Not the Original,"This is NOT the original album...no ""Pump Me Up"", no ""Don't Try To Use Me""...? If you're hoping to go back down memory lane, this is not the album that does it. Me thinks it shoulda been given a different title. An oversight on the part of the label...right?"
3,"Seleccion de musica muy buena, pero la grabacion...","la selección de música se me hizo muy buena, desafortunadamente la grabación no lo es tanto, creo que en parte es debido al tamaño del órgano y la acustica de la catedral, el virtuosismo del organista no deja de sorprenderme sin embargo: ese virtuosismo y la acustica del recinto junto con la grabación, dejan escuchar una interprestacion ""pegajosa"" y poco clara."
5,Lee Jeans Womens One True Fit Wideband Bootcut,"These jeans are perfect! Being a ""big"" girl and being tall besides (5'10"")I rarely find jeans with the correct rise AND a long enough inseam. They are very comfortable and fit well in all the right places. The wideband waistband is high enough in back but low enough in front to still be in style for us larger gals that don't want to wear our granny's elastic waist pants or the super low cuts that the teens wear! I tried 1 pair, they were tight at first but after about 30 minutes the loosened up to be just right! Snug but not TOO snug. Each wearing gets better. I do not dry my jeans...I always hang them...and this seems to work well for these also. I ordered 4 more pairs yesterday!!!"
1,LIE,THIS IS A LIE !!!! IT IS 8 AWG NOT 4 AWG WHY IS THIS LIE POSTED ???NOW I HAVE 150 FEET OF WHAT I CAN NOT USE !!!! TO SHIP BACK WILL COST MONEYRIP OFF !!!
1,"Rocket, Schmocket","What were they thinking?Yes, I do like the series as sci fi comedy but come on, recruiting a high school girl in search of her long lost father to be an astronaut only because she'll fit inside the capsule and is of light enough to allow the rocket that doesn't blow up all the time to launch her into orbit? Through in some vodoo magic and what you get is this mess. Leave your analytical realistic mind at the door and have a giggle. But truly good sci fi? Don't think so. I'm amazed a company actually licensed this for US distribution. If it were priced like Kashimashi, OK, but it simply isn't worth the MSRP. Soon to arrive in the clearance bin. '-)What were they thinking?"
5,Extraordinary guitar playing,"I believe the guitarist's name is Darko Petrinjak - notDakko - as it says on the insert. Mr. Petrinjak displays histechnique, musicianship, and complete mastery of the instrumenton this fine CD."
3,NOT a DVD!,This is NOT the DVD I wanted- but an audio CD with the SAME TITLE! There's a DVD advertised ON Shiva's Abdominal Workout DVD- under the same title as this AUDIO CD. This is misleading! I inserted the cd and waited for the video and nothing happened. The disks look the same. I was not paying attention to the little icon about the media's format on Amazon's site. Bad idea to name the cd the same as the DVD!
5,Can't get enough of this fragrance,"This frangrance is light enough to wear anytime of the day or night. Guaranteed, you to will love it. Try it!"
1,CONTRACT ON AMERICA,Anyone looking at what the Republican controlled congress did TO us knows that this was not a Contract WITH America but a Contract ON America.Shame on you. We need more Democrats in the Senate so that we can get things done. No more Bush to threaten a veto for anything that needed to be done.
2,Contract ON America ?,"When the Republican party initiated the Contract with America, maybe they were talking about a different kind of 'contract' ?"
2,"John Wayne, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond - how can it miss?","But it does. Vera Ralson is part of the problem, she's pretty but bland in the role of Wayne's new bride who sweet-talks him in going to the title state so they can run a riverboat business, but the real weakness is the overall look of the film. An overabundance of rear projection and rather obvious indoor/outdoor scenes gives this 'outer' a distint fake feeling. Duke is amicable in the lead, Bond makes a sturdy villian, Brennan is fine doing his Gabby Hayes impersonation and the film has a rousing climax, but it never rises beyond it's B origins"
1,Pass on This One,"I had high hopes for this movie, being it had Wayne, Brennan, and Ward Bond. However, my hopes were dashed with each passing scene. The plot is weak and confusing. Director Joseph Kane obviously believed the more action, gunfights, and fistfights he could add would make a better film. He was wrong. The action is overdone, actually ridiculous at times, and rather than add to the movie, it detracts. The love story is equally implausible and ridiculous. All in all, this is a very disappointing movie. Made in 1945, it is a very immature western, lacking the depth of plot and characterization that bespeak good films. This is a ""B"" western all the way, and if if comes your way, get out of its way!kone"
4,Entertaining Movie!,Each to his own opinion but I found this movie a lot of fun. I laughed out loud several times and the movie moves at a good pace. It's early John Wayne and I thought all the actors did a good job. If you're a Leonard Maltin wannabe then you'd probably prefer Wayne's Hondo or Searchers. If you simply want to be entertained check it out.
4,Pretty good!,"I am not a fan of all the flavors, but I was able to give the ones I didnt like to friends when they came over. I also gave a few packs to my neighbors who enjoyed them just as much as I did! Even with giving some away, it was a great value! Lasty, I found this taffy to be soft and chewy! I would buy it again."
3,Could have been fresher,"The taffy by itself is tasty, comes well packaged and has a very good price. I do believe that they could have been fresher, they are a bit hard on the outside, but it's a good purchase overall."
3,SOUTH PARKWAY,"The first time i listened to the cd I said It was wack.Then I heard a single off the cd SOUTH PARKWAY which is oneof the best underground rap singles Ive ever heard.I have yet to listen again to the rest of the cd over, butif the other songs sound anything like SOUTH PARKWAY thenthe whole cd may be tight. Most people who know about musicknow that if you rush to listen to a cd with many songs itis possible to skip over very good tracks because the soundis very diverse to your ears when listening fast."
3,SOUTH PARKWAY,"The first time i listened to the cd I said It was wack.Then I heard a single off the cd SOUTH PARKWAY which is oneof the best underground rap singles Ive ever heard.I have yet to listen again to the rest of the cd over, butif the other songs sound anything like SOUTH PARKWAY thenthe whole cd may be tight..."
4,So far so good...,"I have CMT, 10 fused toes, 4 screws, a tendon anchor, and a missing fascia on one foot. After 5 surgeries in 2 years, I have been looking for dress shoes that would be comfortable for my not normal feet. They are nice to look at, and come with insoles that I could configure for each foot. The extra room for my toes and the wide toe box are perfect. They are light enough that I do not have problems lifting my feet off the ground and that should help eliminate some of my trip/fall issues.I have only worn them around the house, but after 40 minutes of being in them, they were still comfortable. Several other orthopedic brands hurt my feet within minutes of putting them on. They are cute and stylish, and are not clunky. I will be able to wear them for work and medieval reenactment.At the moment I am rating this a 4 out of 5. I am hoping to be able to upgrade that once I have had the opportunity to wear them for a full, busy day."
4,"Slow first half, great second half.","I went into the series being excited, as I love the concept. The first half of the season was a little slow, so I lost interest and stopped watching. When the second season was about to come out, I decided to pick up where I left off, and the second half was much better."
5,Grimm the First Episode,I love the Grimm series but came into it late. This first episode puts it all together. I love having the Amazon Prime to catch up on shows and movies.
3,The Show is good,"This is a review of the DVD set of season 1 only. I am more focusing on the features and packaging.The show itself is pretty good.There really aren't a lot of feature and the two behind the scenes videos I bought it for (the VFX and make up FX)were not that informative.there are some deleted scenes and gag reel but no commentaries that I can see.Not really worth $30 since you can still see the first season on hulu. If it goes down in price I would recommend.The box and how it holds the DVDs is pretty weak on its own, no plastic holders just cardboard slips to hold the DVDs whichcan lead to th DVDs getting scratched."
4,Interesting,"Partly, the only reason I'm still watching this is because it has a very interesting storyline. Beyond that, I can't really say I enjoy some of the dialogue and acting in this show. It feels dry, and the emotion completely drained in some of the scenes. I do like the banter between Grimm and his partner though."
1,Bad disks!,"I love the show and this should be clear since I paid for the set so the review is for a product. Disk.1 had deep scratches on it and it wouldn't play. 3 episodes skipped, showed pixels and then the disk stopped and showed the dvd menu. I'm sure it's the poor paper packaging that damaged the disks. The disks are not inside plastic cases, only paper sleeves and glue got stuck on some of the disks."
1,Terrible boxing,"The show is great, but this is about the boxing. The disks are in a sleeve, after watching a few times disk one scratched from taking it in and out. It froze and stopped playing. I returned the set to Amazon who were great about it and they replaced the set no questions asked. Now after a few months disk four is scratched from taking it in and out of the sleeve and it freezes and stops. To late to return it. Terrible boxing."
5,Loves it!,"I really enjoy watching Grimm. It's just one of those shows that hook you in from the pilot. Love how Nick ties being a Grimm in with a cop. Not your ""average"" grimm show, not all about gore and killing the bad guys-Nick the Grimm actually befriends one. I am personally not into monsters and gore. I looove that this story has an underlying plot. There are secrets that need to be revealed! Must watch. Also, I recommend watching A Gifted Man on CBS- perfection"
3,OK Ever Aftermath,Was just OK. Not as good as most of the Grimm episodes. I think big foot could have been a better episode.
5,One of the Best TV Shows Out There,"Innovative, great acting, interesting stories. Everything you can ask for in a drama and more! If you want to encourage original TV programming, you need to support this show."
5,Great for me! SyFy and Coppers all rolled into one :),"This is a great syfy and cop/detective show all rolled into one. The only complaint I have is that they aren't making enough of them........they need to have a bigger staff, more writers and get busy. I have yet to be disappointed in one episode yet.If you don't like Syfy then this isn't for you, but for folks like me its Grrrrrreat!"
3,Rating,I rated it a 3 star because it was in fair condition when I received it. Lots of scratches and had to skip an episode because it was unwatchable. Will need to spend money on repairing the scratches or purchasing a new season. The script was good but not great.
4,Good Series,"Well written and well acted--the series amazingly refuses to descend onto melodrama as its primary manner to forward the plot, unlike 'Nikita'. Best dramatic/thriller series I have seen in awhile--not as good as 'Dollhouse'. That is a high bar to clear."
2,Will not buy anymore seasons,Predictable and boring. Thank heavens I didn't pay too much for this. Plus 1 of the disc's was damaged. Not recommended
3,"GRIMM, a new Series.",A refreshing start to a science fiction series. It is good to know what is what when a series starts. I hope it keeps its momentum through out the year. Bring on episode two (2). Grimm all right.
2,Holy Single Dimensional Formula TV,"This is like a horrible 80s cop show. There's only one uniformed cop in Portland; he's Asian and works every shift. BTW, the main protagonists work 24 hour shifts as well. The subplot is going nowhere! It's almost comedic in its arrested development. The captain is in on something, but we don't know what because he gets 5 seconds of screen-time per episode. It's like Scooby-Doo for adults. We all know who the shapeshifter is and that he's guilty of something. Apple has product placements galore. This show is doomed."
5,grimm,very good picture quality...amazon has excellent series and all come in perfect in color would watch again...especially when i miss the original broadcast on tv
4,I could get into this...,"I've only watched the Pilot episode, but I would definatley watch another episode. Great special effects and good story line. I hope this series becomes a favorite."
4,Need more,All I can say is where is season 3 When will it be available Don't leave me hanging like this.
3,Grimm,"I couldn't get into it. Its nice to get it online, instead of getting physical DVDs in the mail. That way, I can watch what I want, when I want to."
4,Escapism at its best,"An enjoyable series of escapism. Interesting plots, great background scenery and captivating until the end. Looking forward to Season 2."
3,Interesting new take on a old story,"This show isn't bad, I enjoy it quite a bit actually. I really like the new take on old fairy tale characters, and how ""The Grimm"" is a ""bad guy"" to all of them (or at least all of his predecessors were) , and how the new Grimm is working to change that. The only thing that bugs me is the whole ""keeping secrets from the ones we love for their own good"" thing. I HATE all the unnecisary drama that comes out of that crap. It's one of the biggest reasons I never got into daytime soap operas. I feel like there should be enough action between good/evil."
5,Love this program...,The quality was great - I view it through a Roku player. I love the first season. Highly recommend this.
4,Good Fun,"The series is loads of suspense, surprise, fun ... a police story with the twist of supernatural science fiction. Cast is great. I would recommend it to anyone that likes police mystery blended with science fiction."
5,Great show,"Probably one of the most enjoyable shows around right now with an excellent cast and good writing. The amazon service hasn't caused me any problems either. If you're on the fence about this one, I'd say dive right in. You'll get hooked."
5,awesome show,Grimm is a hightlight and I am glad they have made it. I hope it continues for seasons to come
3,disks don't play well,"I love Grimm, but for some reason, these disks don't play well in any of my DVD players. They frequently freeze up for a second or so, sometimes longer. They don't appear to be scratched, so I have no idea what the problem is."
3,It's OK.,I bought this as a gift and really haven't seen that many episodes. The ones I've seen were pretty good.
2,I Didn't Like It,I heard great things about this show on early morning radio in my car. The show did not tickle me at all. My wife didn't like it either.
2,Started Out With Promise,"But it quickly becomes an uninspired cheese-fest with sub-par special FX, sub-par jokes, sub-par storyline, and well it's too bad, it surely had a lot of potential. The main actors are also heavily sub-par. Sorry, I really wanted to like this show."
2,"Great Series, but bad disks","Love the series - that's why I purchased Season 1. Would have rated it as 5 stars.However, had to return the set due to a bad Disk 1 and Disk 5. Disk 1 had deep scratches and the picture would freeze and it couldn't clear itself and move forward. Two episodes were affected by the scratches, the other episodes were okay on the disk. Disk 5 also had several scratches. The set was purchased NEW from Amazon. Had to rate the item as a 2 star.Went to the local Walmart and purchased it again NEW and checked Disk 1 before I tried to use it. Again, Disk 1 was scratched similar to the set from Amazon. Played Disk 1 and this time the pixels started to separate on the screen and distorted the picture and faces. Obviously there is a problem from the manufacturing/packaging process. Had to return it to Walmart for a refund. Not sure if I'll buy it again."
3,good show AWEFUL CHEEP boxing of disks!,I purchased this show and did enjoy it a lot however the boxing of the disks are one of the worst I have ever seen. The disks are inside of sleeves instead of the normal way DVD's are packed. To get the disks out you have to literally fight the box. I can see the disks getting scratched very easily. all in all a good show but the Disk packaging is the sorry est that I have EVER seen.
3,Law & Order: Over The River,"I'm really enjoying television's experiments within fairy tales as in ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Grimm"" may be just as enjoyable. I hope either that the chemistry between Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin increases of that the Little, Not-So-Bad Wolf Monroe gets more time onscreen than Detective Griffin. Also, it's a shame Kung Fu Aunt Marie had to go, I rather liked her. Anyway, six more episodes to go and, unless there's a big negative change in the course of the show, I will watch and enjoy them all."
5,Grimm,"great show, one of the best on tv right now for it type. great cast, great special affects and make up."
3,Entertaing but was expecting more,"This show reminds me alot of the creators previous show ""Angel "" even down to it's very similar score. The show gets better as the season goes along but it suffers from being very formula driven and one dimensional characters.There are a couple of good episodes but it also seems like a typical 80's show of cops and detectives --aka murder occurs in the opening sequences and spend the 40 minute episodes are catching the bad guy. The premise of having a different breed of species falls back too much on Buffy and Angel with all their various demon breeds, but that is just my opinion. It's like I've seen that, been there already, and I'm ready for something fresh."
3,NOT BETTER THEN ANGEL OR BUFFY,"I must Say that Grimm SN 1 was pretty good, it was not as good as Angel or Buffy but it was still good... they should have put more about his History and why when his Aunt did he became a Grim, why couldnt they have both been Grims..."
5,good movie to see with your friends or alone on weekend night,"Reminds of Buffy the Vampire Slayer but has it's own voice. Good actors, good story telling. Interesting view on Brothers Grimm's stories."
4,Good Show / Law and Order meets Harry Potter meets Twilight,I really like this show. I am always on the look out for something diff and this show is very weird. The acting is ok but the unusual characters is pretty cool. I like how everyone is human looking and you only get a chance to see their true side for just a second. This aspect keeps it less silly. All and all good show.
2,blaaah,"could not get into this, heard alot of good reviews but to me it was just hokey i was expecting scarey or at least a more cutting edge scare but it didnt deliver for me"
1,The show is fabulous but the DVD's were damaged!,I love Grimm! It's a great show which is why I ordered the DVD of the series however of the 5 disks in the set three of them had sections that were so badly damaged I could not get them to play. I asked for an exchange haven't gotten the new disks yet so I can't say anything but it was very very disappointing to get a damaged and therefore unenjoyable product!
5,Great show!,"Not into all the vampire shows, but this show is different. Has a great sense of humor. UltraViolet is a big plus!"
4,"Love, Bill","This is a necessary addition to your Burroughs library. Interesting insights into WSB. Companion to Yage Letters, Naked Lunch."
2,Why?,"Opera in English has become somewhat of a dinosaur in this era of subtitles, supertitles etc. and yet it can be a great help in introducing people to the art form.That said, this recording of Donizetti's rather uneven opera is something of a wasted effort. The English version only serves to point out the weakness of the libretto. Janet Baker, always a totally dedicated artist, copes well with the soprano role of Mary - a role better recorded by Sills, Sutherland and company. Rosalind Plowright sounds consistently hysterical as Queen Elizabeth and her diction is totally unintelligible. David Rendall fares little better and the only person who comes through is John Tomlinson as Talbot. The sound is very good.Question: when is ENO, or anyone for that matter, going to record ""The Magic Flute"" in English - now that would be worth it!!"
2,It's got ideas.. but...,"Okay. So the book is chuck full of ideas, but you need a masters degree in reading technical manuals in order to implement them. As soon as I began to read the ""instructions"", my muse packed her bags and headed to parts unknown.Save your money, and buy other, more straight-forward plot point books."
4,Ideas for your imagination,"This book gives great, flexible plot ideas that can be used by a variety of writers. This book will be very useful for me when I am in a rut, or don't know where to go with my characters. It doesn't create a story, but gives ideas of the where you can lead your story. I was skeptical after reading other reviews, but if you have any talent, or imagination, this book will only enrich your writing goals. Definently a book to have on your shelf!"
2,Disappointingly retro.,"""Plots Limited"" would be a more apt title. There is not that great a variety, unless you want to limit yourself to the cliched, the hackneyed, the predictable, or the downright silly.I've been through this book several times and have yet to find it useful. What I find instead is that I can actually name the TV movies, miniseries, and bad TV shows where these plots have already appeared. (And time has not made them any more palatable.) This makes it more of a trivia game than a writer's reference.However, if you're looking for a nostalgic journey through The Worst of 1970s and '80s Television, this book is for you."
4,Needs more variety!,The problem with this book is that each of the plots lead to odd endings. I have a hard time findig a good story line that could be used for fantasy or SF. I don't see any chance for horror writers. The plots also use a lot of cultural stereo-typing. The use of the word primitive is primitive. I still find the book useful as a springboard for non-cliche ideas.
1,"DON""T BUY THIS! IT'S A RIPOFF of PLOTTO. BUY PLOTTO!","In 1928, William Wallace Cook wrote Plotto.Nowhere did I find any reference to Plotto in Plots Unlimited wherein the aut...(no I cannot really say author) state that his entire book, Plots Unlimited is an unabashed ripoff of the 1928 book. What kind of a person steals not only another's idea but does so almost down to the layout, page by page? Are you that devoid of ideas, you must steal them? I think it is disgusting!IT DESERVES 0 STARS.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! BUY PLOTTO, IT'S EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE."
1,Save your dollars; write your own plots.,"Unless you are the writer of failing sit-coms and drugstore paperbacks, I suggest spending your money elsewhere. There is little here that the serious writer has not already entertained and/or discarded in his mind(most likely discarded). The plots, unlimited as they're proclaimed to be, are quite limited in originality and scope. By scope, I mean to say that the offered plots are confining, both in structure and action. All things considered, I would not reccomend this book to anyone, especially not to writers."
1,Nearly Impossible To Use,"The idea behind this book is great, but in reality it's nearly impossible to use. I had high hopes when I purchased it but was very disappointed once I read it. The directions were confusing, and the whole book is too disjointed to be helpful. Because it was so expensive I tried several times over a year to read it and glean something I could use just to justify the expense. Each time I would walk away no better off than I was before. It's too bad the author didn't take the general idea of this book, simplify the directions, update it, and definately make the whole thing user friendly. What a waste of money."
2,A science text book might have been more helpful,"This isn't the most user-friendly book I've ever read, and the plots are straight out of a bad 80's soap-opera. It might help get your brain going when experiencing writers block, but I doubt you'd get your money's worth out of it."
2,What's all the Hype about?,"This book, like the other reviews say, isn't much help. It's basically the plots for old movies that I've seen once or twice, but are way before my time. (Not that long ago, I'm only a teen) The book though, helped me think of other ideas for stories, but I'm sure glad I didn't buy it. (Just checked it out from the library)"
3,Performance is fine but video and audio qualities are unacceptable,"This is a DVD re-master of (I guess) an old video tape recording. While it is good for perhaps nostalgic reasons or for archiving the fine performance of the very talented Ms. Argerich, this product is basically un-watchable and un-listenable. The video is poor quality, for example, Ms. Argerich's hand movements are so much blurred that one can't recognize which notes she was playing. The audio reminds me of old cassette tapes of classical music with limited bandwidth, audio noise and poor dynamic range. I can't recommend this product."
4,Martha Argerich plays Tchaikovsky,"I have all her four Tchaikovsky recordings. So this is a must-have obviusly. I would say that her touch in this concert is a bit lighter by comparing to any of her recordings. The playing is stunning of course, but the BBC recoded sound is only average. Still, A dvd release recorded in her prime is always welcome."
3,Not as good as the others.,This is the fourth book in the A-List series.I didn't enjoy reading this book compared to the first three. Those were way better. This one lacked some excitement and some of the things that made the other books good.Hopefully the next installment of this series will be better than this book.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Overall, I was very disappointed in this item; there's a reason it's such a cheap price and they're trying to get rid of them. It's a smaller guitar than I expected, and the strings are poor quality nylon -- the 1E string snapped on me as I was tuning it, five minutes out of the box. Also, because it doesn't have a trust board, you can't restring it steel strings. The ""tuner"" it comes with is just a pitch pipe (with a tinny sound at that), and the other ""accessories"" aren't as great an added advantage as you'd think. Personally, I returned this after the string snapped on me. I'd recommend this guitar only if you're an absolute beginner, and even then, you'd probably want to learn on something a little more durable than this."
1,Stay AWAY!,"This guitar is really cheap, so it doesnt surprise me that it's made from a nameless company, the tuner is just a pitch pipe. The whole package is a sham, please buy the Yamaha C40 instead, save your money and dont but this."
2,not the greatest,I am a beginner and bought this to try out my hand at guitar. So I wanted something cheaper to begin with. What I don't like is that I can't get it in tune.
4,down periscope,a mixed up mess of miss fits pull togother to become a well oiled machine to show the higher ups whos better.
5,Down Periscope,"Had a hard time finding this, the copy i received was new and the movie is just great... Received my copy in just days after ordering."
3,Good clean fun,"Not offensive, funny in places, not bad acting, conflict and victory. I liked the show but can not say it was one I'd have to watch again."
4,Super Silly Fun!,"No, not the finest comedy, but they take the perfect tongue in cheek - wink to the camera mix and really seem like they're enjoying themselves."
5,Fun Movie,"If you are looking for great, lighthearted fun, you won't be disappointed with this one. I will watch it again for sure."
5,fun movie,made me laugh....nice to have a funny move without it being vulgar ....and can watch with the family...will ad it to my DVD collection
3,Stated Blu-Ray,I love the movie but when i was looking for it i typed in Blu-ray and this came up so i orderd it thinking it was a blu-ray but it was not. but i will keep it because i like the movie.
5,Lost it on the DVR,We had it DVR'd and lost it with many others that we liked to see often. Glad to have it now on hand where ever we want to watch it.
5,Great Movie,As great as I remembered. This movie is great and I enjoyed watching it for the first time in years.
5,Down Periscope Review,"The movie is a typical good guy under-dog VS. the big Bad guys. The switch here is that one of the biggest dogs is actually on Cmdr Dodge's side. The only sad part of the movie is where the Diving Officer kisses the CO, giggles and takes off. Other than that it was a great film and had a laugh a minute."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"The movie is old, but the comedy is timely. An antiquated submarine in war games and military political games makes for an entertaining plot!"
4,One of my favorite old movies,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. New comedies just rely on really drunk people doing or saying stupid things, there's good humor in the writing here."
3,Hilarious!,Looking for a good laugh? Lotta quirky humor and interesting premise - diesel sub vs entire nuclear navy. My favorite character is Stupanic (spelling?) . It always been a curiosity that he is not listed on IMDB nor in the credits on the dvd. Can watch it again and again.
3,Love the movie...hate the DVD,"Finally got my DVD copy of Down Periscope...my favorite movie starring Kelsey Grammer. I opened it immediately and put it in my DVD player, saying to myself, NOW I will see the whole movie in WIDESCREEN!!Nope.They did not put out the orignal print. This is the pan-and-scan version with the top and bottom of the screen chopped off. Its very apparent in several parts of the movie. I ran my VHS on one TV and the DVD on the home theater...its the same width of screen.I was also not impressed with the 5.1 surround. Not nearly enough seperation and use of the back speakers, or subwoofer!! Buckman's fart should have come booming out of my subfoofer...Nada.At least the colors and quality of print on the pan-and-scan side are better than my VHS copy.Movie is great. DVD is not."
5,One of THE best comedy pictures,"An outstanding outing for Kelsey Grammer and a cute tease on Navy brass. Why it took so long to get this to DVD one can only guess. Perhaps Paramount was trying to drop its inventory of VHS blanks; I know I've worn out a couple on this movie. Good family movie, almost reminiscent of old Disney slapstick humor and one liners. To bad the movie execs are not intuitive enough to make a sequel to this one. The laughs would be unstoppable on a modern day submarine."
3,"Down Periscope, Up with the Laughs !!!","My wife and I really enjoyed this movie, funny from the start with a veteran cast. This movie may not have crushed the box office, but its fun without alot of vulgar language and nudity to deter from the story like so many contemporary flicks."
4,Pretty Darn Funny,"Okay, I admit to downing the odd highball today, but this really is a pretty funny movie. Put on your swabbie hat, hoist a brew or five, and prepare to pillage some laughs. The fact that the (unnamed) movie channel showed the complete credits will give you a hint. Few submarine movie cliches go unmined.In France they say ""Cherchez la Femme"". Here in the U.S. we tend to say ""Follow the Money"". This movie probably made up a contract commitment for Kelsey Grammer, making it even funnier (at least for those of us who know contracts)."
3,Adequate amusement,"The comedic formula works: a semi-disgraced officer is given a crew of losers and a mission designed to end his career. The electrician isn't real good with electricals. The sonar guy does whale imitations that practically get the submarine laid. A neurotic executive officer seems to live in a permanent state of panic. The female officer - well you can guess. In the end, the band of misfits pulls together and torpedoes the career of the grasping officer who had expected to fuel his own success with their failure.Utterly forgettable, but OK if you don't have to pay for it.-- wiredweird"
1,Misrepresented,"I received my shipment, but what was not specified in the sale was that the movie itself was in the EUROPEAN format and therefore incompatible with all of my devices. Now I have to return it and HOPE that the next one isn't the same way... because I have no way of knowing from the item description (which was less than minimal) and the seller took no responsibility for the error. It was a great price, but unfortunately the whole process was a complete waste of time.Down Periscope"
1,This is not a DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this movie bc ive always wanted to see it but upon recieving it I noticed it was a VHS, NOT a DVD!!!!!!"
1,Stink Bomb,"I saw this in the theater when it came out, and had to leave halfway through. That was the first and only time I have left before a movie concluded... I just could not continue with the film after all of the fart jokes, and the like. Worse still, the jokes were not even funny in my opinion (and yes, you can have funny base-humor). Maybe I am just too old to enjoy such low-level comedy and writing as was used in Down Periscope, but I think this has to be considered one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I apologize to all the other reviewers that enjoyed the film quite a bit... I guess it just wasn't for me.Possible alternatives in the same kind of comedy genre (but in my opinion much better) include Something About Mary, American Pie and Mystery Date. I think all of those will give a much better bang for the buck, while still not taxing your mind too much."
5,Funny,So good to watch a comedy that leaves you rolling on the floor. Look to find more along these topics for future purchasing.
4,A Great Re-Write,"This movie is a modern adaptation of Operation Petticoat starring Carry Grant and Tony Curtis. I like it very much,, but if you really want to see its roots, check out Operation Petticoat."
5,Classic Navy humor,A good laugh from the past. It was interesting seeing the old diesel boats taking on the more modern nuclear Navy.
4,a good movie,"This is a good sitting at home with the family and eating pizza and drinking sodas movie,with the kids,I think there were only a few ""be careful with kids moments."". I would definiately watch it again."
2,"Not very well made, too predictable",Don't waste your time. This movie is predictable and poorly acted. One of the best I've ever seen. 5 stars!
3,Down Periscope,"What to say about this movie. It is meant to be funny. If you're not looking for a really deep, thinking man's type of humor. It scores, big time."
5,dvd,items were just as discribed had a couple of gliches but played on thru them and would buy again
3,Cruising Above Periscope Depth!,A disfunctional crew.A disfunctional diesel sub.A sexy blonde.......and Kelsey Grammer as Captain!Chaos could not have a better description. You will love it!My only regret is the use of actual WW II footage in the editing.
5,Down Periscope,"After looking a couple places for this movie, It is my Husbands all time favorite, He loves it. Pretty much LOVES IT.. I was able to purchase it through you and have it sent to me and get it here before Christmas and not only that they sent it free shipping, My only problem and yes it is a biggie is that they did send it dilivery comfermation, IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS,,,,"
3,"Tollerable DVD, Fun Movie","If you're reading this, you likely already know how much fun this movie is. One of the few I'll watch many times. But the DVD job here is mediocre at best. Like one other said, faked widescreen, ok audio, no specials. But if you don't mind having a fullscreen (and good) copy on DVD with fair audio, that you won't wear out (easily), hear you go!Shame on 20th Century Fox for such a shabby effort, knowing full well they'll use the funds from this to pay for the real enhanced release in a few months no doubt. They know we'll still buy it. But now we know to rent from them first, then wait for the enhanced editions. Me? Couldn't wait....this movies too good."
4,Down Periscope,Someone told my husband that this was a good movie and it was good except the cuss words I didn't think were needed but it was a funny movie.
4,Fun evening's entertainment,"Not a blockbuster, but very entertaining. Worth the price even if you think of it as an single-evening alternative to going to the movie and spending more money to sit next to someone's child.In fact, you'll come back to it once in a while, which makes the second and later viewings a free ticket to a fun evening."
4,LOL,"I made the mistake of watching this on an airplane ride, (I must admit to a loud cackle of a laugh) and had to control my laughter. It's not academy award material, but it IS great entertainment!"
5,Down Periscope,"Kelsey Grammer and crew fix up a decrepit submarine and attempt to beat the US Navy in wargames, successfully!Fast paced, hysterical movie with a million laughs. Highly recommended!"
4,good sillynes,Kelsey Grammer is a master of drool humor and surrounded by a bunch of crackpots makes for a great movie
4,Welcome Aboard,"If you love Kelsey Grammer as Fraiser, you'll fall all over again with him as a Captain. Who doesn't love a man in a uniform;) Down Periscope is funny, charming and over all a great movie to sit back and enjoy. The mis-fit crew is All-Star and makes the movie 10 times better. Love it!!"
3,Love the movie - poor DVD transfer is distracting,"""Down Periscope"" is one of my absolute favorite comedy movies. The movie is 5 stars. Unfortunately the DVD transfer on an HD system is marginal, and that's on a system with upscaling capabilities. The DVD is watchable but distracting. Hopefully a BD will be released at some point with a much better transfer."
5,Down periscope,"THIS MOVIE IS HILLARIOUS!! I LOVED IT. The DVD was in good shape and well worth the money. I've seen it a 100X and will probably watch it a 100 more X. Thanks, Mike Berry"
4,Funny,"A funny, light movie, ridiculous movie. A go-to movie when you want to see something lighthearted, this movie will do."
3,It's a Mommy Movie,"Kelsey is his same ol' self, funny, funny, funny. This is no mystrey movie by any means, but very enjoyable."
5,Very entertaining.,Unlikely premise but still quite amusing based on the interactions of cast. Recommended for ex-Navy and military vets. Would have been better without the F-bombs.
2,"Not Great, But Not Terrible","After reading all of the glowing reviews for this film (and being a big fan of Kelsey Grammer) I expected this to be an undiscovered comedy gem. Uh...no. It's pleasant and innocuous, but totally predictable (except when it overindulges in being ludicrous). Grammer doesn't have much to work with here; stilted dialogue and ""action"" scenes which lack action. This is all augmented by some painful and/or pointless mugging from the supporting players. Ouch.I actually enjoy a simpleminded comedy that makes me laugh - but this one simply didn't. Grammer is reasonably charming (albeit totally one dimensional), and Rob Schneider is predictably annoying. Virtually everyone else in the film is a cliche.I'mn clearly in the minority here, but have to say that this just isn't a very good or very funny film."
4,Stands the test of time,I had never seen this movie in so many years until now and I must say liked it. Real and good humor. The modern day cheap comedies dont hold a candle to this classic. Very well made. Nice witty funny dialogues. All in all well worth the time and money for a easy relaxing movie that actually makes you laugh.
5,classy!,"I usually order nine west 8 and a half because the size fits me perfectly. I wanted this pair in classic black but amazon had run out so I decided to get it in this beautiful dark fuchsia color. It was lovely! Beautiful shape, classy satin material. Plus the bow wasn't as big as I thought it would be so the shape of the shoe is still very streamlined. Very happy with it and can't wait for my next formal night out to wear it."
3,Intriguing movie; bad video quality.,"I thought the movie was excellent despite it's ""student film"" qualities ... maybe that contributed to my perception. The subject matter might be disturbing for some. The commentaries and other extras was quite interesting and gave a lot of insight. It is a pity the video quality of the DVD is even worse than VHS; I couldn't figure out if it was by design or just because of a bad transfer. I found the Spanish hard to understand, apart from not speaking it well, it was difficult to hear the words. The subtitling was adequate, although not very well formated."
3,Christianity and Queerness,"There is a lot of Christianity in this film, its perspective. The boy, a hustler in a big city, is almost a sacrifice, being offered up to customers. There are some themes of redemption and doubt, but they're not explored as much as they could have been. It is a film that is knowledgeable about grittiness without losing sight of some grace within. Another film like this that comes to mind, that deals with themes of religion and its confrontation with queerness in Catholic latino culture, is ""Our Lady of the Assassins"""
5,old school,Sin Destino follows the old school realistic and at times crude and cruelty that make el cine mexicano the best in the 50's . The movie was filmed black and white just to give that extra little of realism. The subject of the movie I would say is the average of a perv that lives in a 3 world country and the way a normal teenager would act drugged and with grudge in his heart.
5,A Wonderful Story....,"""Shackleton's Stowaway"" is a fabulous piece of historical fiction. Well-researched, the characters come alive in this compelling story of survival, hope, and courage. The writing is excellent, and the story a real attention-getter for children. The virtues of another time come to life under McKernan's creative crafting of an unforgettable story."
2,An impossible read,Victoria McKernan's book is a disappointing read. I have already enjoyed Jennifer Armstrong's Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World : The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance and found it a much better telling of this extraordinary tale. McKernan's writing did not flesh out the characters and her choppy pacing did not convince this reader to finish the story.
2,A RIP OFF!!,"This booklet is a rip off. It's like the publisher just copy and pasted information from Wikipedia and around the internet. And forget about it helping you setting up a pond or anything else for that matter. The cover says ""small scale"" but it only makes (very vague) reference to ""5 acre ponds"" (and larger) and then does not even say how to set that up. I was hoping to set up a small pond in my back pasture, something like 10 feet by 20 feet. Forget it. If this is even possible, this ""book"" isn't going to help you. This booklet was put out by a scam artist who just wanted to make some cash off people like me (those who wanted real, practical information). Don't be fooled. Anyone can self-publish free information and make money off it. The information isn't even good (much less useful). If anything, this will teach you how you can publish crap off the internet to make money off honest people. The 2 stars are for the fact that it makes good fire kindling."
1,Nothing yet.,Still have not received it. Really dont even want it anymore as it is too late in the season.
1,What's Charlie Rose doing on TARZAN?,"Unless this has Phil Collins talking about TARZAN,on CHARLIE ROSE. Then Why is it that AMAZON & CDnow put items in files like TARZAN dvd's.You guys also throw in non related items in other areas? Why?Can you guys truely act like an honest source for customers & give ME!! Us? The real content that we are searching for. CRIKEY man!PP"
1,Not as advertised,"This product is an unassembled, unpainted lead casting that does not resemble the picture. There is no mention of this in the product description."
1,Pathetic,"Picture misleads into something you are not expecting to see, the product is an unassembled, unpainted and does not resemble the picture at all. I felt very disapointed with it, wasted my money..."
4,Nice novel about old Ireland,"I am planning a trip to Ireland and always enjoy reading some books set in the place I am visiting. This novel is a nice look at the older Ireland. It deals with the Church and the conflict with the Church of some local villagers who want to do their traditional ""wren dance"" celebration. It was a good read and I think I got a feel for the place I am going to be visiting."
5,Missional Church,"When I began to read this book, I couldn't put it down. In fact, I read until 2am! He explains exactly what it means to be on mission for God. He takes you logically through the principles of missional church and helps you know what to expect. At the end of each chapter is a section to reflect and apply as well as to assess just exactly where your church is in the process of becoming missional. He points out how we need to be authentic disciples of Christ and reach the world outside the walls of the church - be missional."
5,Great set!,"Tozer and Hamelin sort of match each other on their feeling for Medtner, but Tozer has this refinement, this elegance, this flowing poetry to the music with suits Medtner perfect. THe sound on these cd's is also greatly produced. Tozer has a depth in understanding and in phrasation that is simply incredibly, and I love to listen ofte to these cd's that never tire, make untransparent slavic music very transparent and at the same time do not loose the deeper sentiments in it.Buy it if you like Medtner!"
2,ONLY ONE SONG IS GOOD,"I was surprised that this album was boring OTHER than for the one song I wanted as a 'must have.' And that, of course, is White Christmas.Had it on tape for years and play it every holiday season for 2 months.This song is worth the price of the CD. It's cheap too."
2,One song is worth the price,"This CD was cheap to buy, and that was a good thing because of all the cuts, only the featured song, White Christmas, is worth the price. The other songs are not recognizable."
3,*Not that bad*,"While I appreciate the remarks about this book's apparently juvenile simplicity, I have to disagree about the book's apparent worthlessness. Surely the intention of it was not to be a comprehensive logistical manual for making love. Instead it is more like a greeting card on steroids~~intended to stimulate the imagination of your special someone. I bought it for that purpose, and it was enjoyed for that purpose. Several of the brief suggestions have certainly fueled more detailed fantasies between us! Sometimes it's good to do your own thinking instead of letting the book do your thinking for you"
3,Fair but incomplete,"After reading this book, I have to say that the book by Gurtin is nicely written --- from the context of typesetting. But the content is really not detail enough. It is more suitable for people who are very familar with continuum mechanics already and want to write their equations in a nice and 'sexy' way !"
4,A good introductory book on Enterprise portals,"If you are looking for a good introductory book on corporate/enterprise portals you will find this useful. Introduces the concept and anatomy of a portal, capabilities and features. Provides a brief overview of portal development strategies, development tools and a few interesting case studies (brief!). There are very few publication available (more available by the end of this year) on the emerging concept of corporate portals and consequently this book is a bit overpriced."
1,Not as described - Be Careful,"Bottom line - after years of shopping Amazon, this is the single most-misleading item I've ever received. Folks - this is ""STRANDED SPEAKER WIRE""!!!! It is ""NOT"" 8 GA GRND wire. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. The product description is misleading. What I SHOULD HAVE REC'D (based on THEIR description) is SOLID CORE COPPER WIRE;, - - solid core copper wire is a TRUE ""GROUND"" wire, not stranded speaker wire. With postal fees and gas what they are, I ended up ""selling"" this to my nephew for 1/2 what I paid for it......and that's the only reason I didn't return it. I'll go to a Big Box Store now and get what I should have gotten in the first place. I'll never buy anything with the ""Pyramid"" name on it again!"
3,Is it a ground wire or not?,"I got this so-called 8 gauge wire, for a grounding wire, to a rooftop TV antenna. No lightning strikes so far so I really can't say how good it is. Hope things stay that way."
4,"High quality, looks good","Very nice wiring for custom sound systems. Looks good, very pliable, thick insulation, good copper density. Only complaint is this wire is not 8 gauge. More like 10 or 11. But still worth the money."
2,"Boring, mistitled.","After seeing, and enjoying the film ""The Magdalen Sisters"" I wanted to find more factual information about the subject. This was the only book available.I was, unfortunately, VERY disappointed. The book is poorly written; the author jumping from one subject to another rather than following any logical pattern. She looks at not only the Magdalen Asylums in Ireland (as the title implies)but 'rescue homes' for prostitutes run by a variety of organizations, and located in both Ireland and England. The main focus of the book (such as it is) is on early to mid-19th century institutions. At that time the asylums and homes were used almost exclusively by prostitutes, and attendence was purely voluntary. (The author notes that most women left after only a few months, unwilling or unable to cope with the strict rules.) The book barely touches on the more recent history of the asylums. (It was mostly in the mid-to-late 20th century that they were inhabited primarily by unwed mothers.)"
3,Good for 1 year,"I bought this iron just about a year ago, probably a little under a year, used it every day, and it was great until last week. The vertical steam function was nice, as was the adjustable steam level. A while ago the cord reel function stopped working well; the reel would only retract about half the cord and just stop. This was inconvenient, especially since one of the selling points is a retractable cord, but not enough to make me go looking for a new iron. Last week out of nowhere the steam function stopped working altogether (vertical, horizontal, various heat/steam settings, etc), so I'm had to use a 4-year old B&D which, while not as nice, worked. This was a nice iron, but even though it was relatively cheap it should have lasted more than a year."
3,Iron is good but design is poor.,"I have used Sunbeam irons in the past and have had good use from them. The Shot of Steam is the feature that must be in any iron I use and that is why I purchased this model. The retractable cord was not a consideration and now that I have it, I don't like it. It does not retract fully.In most irons the sole plate covers almost all of the bottom surface. In this iron it does not because of the retractable cord housing. When I iron I apply pressure with the heel of my hand and it usually is over the center of the soleplate. In this iron it is at the very bottom of the soleplate or not over the soleplate at all. This is a very awkward design and not very efficient.I would not buy this iron again or recommend it to anyone."
1,It didn't last...,I had mine 9 months and ironed only 3-4 shirts per week. One day it worked... the next day it would not heat up. I found a similar complaint on other sunbeam models reviewed here on Amazon and on-line when I googled my problem.
2,Sticks to clothes,"After a couple of time of using it, the bottom started sticking to the fabric and not gliding. Even when it was new, it took forever to iron things. I just switched to Rowanta Effective Iron, and i can iron clothes in half the time I did with the sunbeam when it was brand new. But the last time I used the Sunbeam, I couldn't even iron one shirt, as it wouldn't glide over."
1,Not a Good Product,"I've never given much thought to my iron before; probably have only owned 5 or 6 in my life and all have worked about the same - until now! This Sunbeam did not glide well over fabrics (on any setting), retractable cord is balky and didn't retract all the way after the second use, and it leaks HORRIBLY! Save yourself the aggravation - do not buy this product!"
1,My encyclopedia has more information on Newgrange,"This ""book"" is apparently aimed at the 3-10 year-old age group. It reads as a ""Dick & Jane"" book. No photos and ""illustrated"" by a comic-book wanna'- be artist. Fifteen ""pages"" of ""text"", 1-3 paragraphs each. An insult to Celtic/Irish heritage. Totally worthless."
3,Notable for its guest star casting,"Later to make himself known as ""Quark"" on DS9, Armin Shimerman dons the lobes of Ferengi commander ""Bractor"" in this episode from the series' second season. This was not the first time that the actor portrayed one of big-earred aliens, having assayed similar and distinctive characterizations in two earlier installments.The story is rather routine and not among the show's best but it's worth a look for the development of Ferengi as pivotal characters in the Trek mythology."
1,Bigotry dressed up as scholarship,"Priest Miceli simply offers another rehash of the usual charges that unbelievers deify themselves, humanity, and their own perverted desires. In reality, it is Miceli who ends up claiming, without sufficient facts or reason, that he magically knows that his own Roman Catholic faith is the One Truth. I had hoped to find something more imaginative and more thought-provoking than this, but that's really all he's arguing. And so it ends up being nothing but an angry, delusional, and a rather pathetic attack on those who don't agree with the Vatican's doctrines and dogmas."
2,Not the best iPod radio out there,"We got this for my daughter. She loves it because it has Hello Kitty on it. But it drives me nuts for a few reasons: the display flickers constantly now (we've had it for about a year), and the radio stations drift (it'll be set to 99.1, say, and then, after a few hours or so, will be at 99.2 or 3). But it does sound decent, and is fairly easy to use."
2,The Way of A Ship,This was not the book that we thought it was. Derek Lundy used the title of a much better book by Alan Villiers--printed in 1970. Lundy even cited the Villiers book but it was just a book written to ride the popularity of the Villiers book. We had to go to a rare book site to buy the real book by Villiers. It was a waste of our money.
1,Mistake,"The way of a Ship / Terek LundyThis purchase was a mistake and I am simply unable to start the reading, although I tried.I am collecting/reading ""the real thing"" on the saile era,written by those who were then involved.( Am finding texts in English, Dutch, French & a bit in German - unfortunately, I do not read Swedish/Finnish ).Maybe Mr Terek Lundy is an excellent author, but this book is not what I was looking for.R Grommé"
3,lasted less than a year,"This stroller was great,but lasted less than a year. The handle bar literally broke off while my husband was going up a flight of stairs. My 21 month old baby (who is 24 lbs.) went down a flight of steps while in the stroller and suffered a bruised lip, cheek and chin. The aluminum frame is great but the plastic handle is no good, I would recommend checking out Maclaren strollers instead. As with all things, I wish we would have known."
1,Self-evident ignorance,"This is a painful piece of work, designed to make you feel like you're doing something important. Anything that truly resonates is borrowed from Joseph Campbell's work. Read that...or read David Mamet's work on writing (Three Uses of A Knife and Bambi vs. Godzilla comes to mind). Aristotle's Poetica. Good story writing is difficult to do but easy to explain: make the audience/reader want to know what happens next.In giving examples to prove his points, he consistently re-imagines the themes/meanings and plots of widely known work so that it fits his ""formula."" He doesn't even follow his own imaginary principles."
3,Lots of info but not motivational and boring,"This is a book full of information on writing. It breaks down the task of writing into almost like a math problem or some sort of physics formula.It's a good way to analyze your script when you are done but a beginner writer shouldn't be required to follow this formula or else the first draft of the script will never be done.I got this book hoping to learn some tips on writing before I started my script but looking at the book, chapter titles and flipping through it reminded me of a calculus book.The analysis was not motivational or interesting at all. It actually made me procrastinate on reading this book and also using it to help me write.Don't get overwhelmed with these formulas and just start writing.One good book is ""Alone in a Room""."
5,pretty amazing stuff,"I discovered this album by accident, and it is SOOO GOOD! Its less punk, though still some punk, and much more high energy dub/reggae. The studio did them quite a bit of justice, I'm not a big fan of the peel sessions album. The singer is amazing, her voice is unique, raw, on target and all over, with a little Colin Hay magic vibrato time to time. Really well mixed with a really unique sound; alot of the songs are similar-ish but the sound is so good its still worth picking up. Reminiscent, I suppose of looser, earlier dub-y Clash. The instant hit song is really clever, elctronic sounding almost, except nothing's electronic, very cool multi-layered half spoken vox. The ""Grapevine"" cover is the punkiest itemon here, & more dynamic and open than most girl punk I've heard. I also loev Ping-Pong affair & FM... They just had a great sound, and this is the best of it."
5,can't believe it's not butter,"Man the Slits are great. I can't believe it took me this long to find them. I think i have a new favorite group, the Slits. Their music just talks to me. It makes me wanna take action not just sit on my ... all day. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD."
5,one you must have,"Whatever it is, The Slits did it first and maybe best. This record is great to howl along with while driving or showering. Girls having fun and making cool sounds. Before you buy that ""old"" riot grrl record which might be great but might [upset] you off more than inspire you, buy this older (reissue) and hear strong women living loudly! This just might be where it all began."
5,"""fun fun fun, I'm having fun!""","this is one of my favorite albums. the music is quirky, hooky, and very fun to listen to!! its the only album i own by The Slits and i'd like to get more but i'm kind of strapped for cash right now... my favorite songs include ""Ping Pong Affair"", ""Typical Girls"", ""So Tough"" and ""Newtown"" but everything on this album rocks. i'm suprised more people haven't heard their cover ""Heard it Through the Grapevine"", its great!!..."
4,Four thumbs up to Pyramid,Pyramid RSW18500.Is as described. Serves it purpose well. Flexible yet durable insulation and high quality copper wire @ a good price.
1,Junk! The picture shows 25FT 10-12 Guage Wire.,"Don't look at the picture if you aren't sure how is 18 gauge wire looks like!!! The wire is cheap, very difficult to stripe without cutting tiny wires that it consist of. Quality of sound is very weak even for speakers. Don't buy it for Subs!!!I got 440' of wire for the birds. I spent about two days of my time to run the wires and mount the AMP. I have to buy another wire and do it again!!!"
5,"Great voice, and she writes her own stuff!","These days it seems like many performers are simply inserted into their pre-fabricated careers. Their music is all written for them, and there is such a lack of authenticity. Ruby Amanfu is the exception. She writes or co-writes all the music on her album. She has a terrific voice, is a talented writer, and both ""Sugah"" and ""Some of that Marley"" are great songs with tight sound and big hooks."
3,The quality is what you expect,"For $5 you're gonna get $5 quality.The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because none of the sellers listed the sizes, which areunfortunately I needed 1/16.I added some pictures of the item to help people out!"
1,worthless,Doesn't come with the tool you need to use the screw extractors. Completely worthless. Thanks for nothing.
1,Waste of Money,"While I am a great fan of many of the talented people in this movie, Carpool Guy was a great disappointment. I've seen the quality work all these people do and I feel this was not really the actors fault, but the lame writing. It is supposed to be a comedy and that did not come thru at all. It had a good premise, and could have been so much more. Applause to Corbin Bernson for using his Mom in the film, but her speech is difficult to understand."
5,Carpool Guy,My daughter and I enjoyed the movie. It was fun seeing so many familar faces in the movie. I hope they make another.
3,"Great subject, poorly written","Despite the fascinating topic, Sarah Wise has somehow managed to create an oddly sprawling, poorly conceived narrative. The book rambles from the actual case and the related fields of bodysnatching and criminal investigation to broad discussions of poverty, the London meatmarket, and for some reason, the exact dimensions of the perpetrators' gardens. Obviously Wise spent a great deal of time researching the crime and its context, but she also seemed to have a great deal of trouble deciding what details to include and how to connect them to the stated topic."
3,A fascinating story presented in an uniteresting format,"The murder mystery of the Italian boy and other victims of 19th century ""burking"" (body snatching) should be a suspenseful, Grand Guignol true-crime fest for readers. But author Sarah Wise, whose research seems largely reliant on descriptive passages from Charles Dickens' work, writes a slow moving, tedious account of facts and figures infused with very little of the human element that would make it interesting.More like a text book on the squalid living in 1830s London than a non-fiction yarn, I was most disappointed with this overlong read. Would be handy as a resource guide to the subject matter and also includes many interesting and well reproduced illustrative engravings."
3,more than you would ever want to know...,"the reviews of this book were generally favorable, but i found the detail overwhelming. actually, i should say, the extraneous details were overwhelming. the author went down too many side roads for my taste and repeated information from one section of the book to another. i think she took this route because when it came right down to it, she did not have a lot of historical material to draw from . . . so she resorted to what i can only call filler. but, on the plus side, she can write clearly, if not succinctly."
2,"Dry, dry book........",Couldn't slog through this book. Very dry and not in a style I enjoy reading. Couldn't get through it.
4,Other Books,"If you want this much detail, looks pretty good to me. This is very in depth, and is not a quick, breezy, layperson or coffee table type style look at the subject. The book is definitely an academic type work, so do not get it unless that is specifically what you are looking for."
5,A Delightful Read,A completely delightful time. Easy to read and beautiful illustrations. This is a great gift for your hostess. Thanks!
5,Excellent Album,I have had this album for about 10 years now and it still rocks. The vocals and lyrics are awesome! Wish there were a second album
5,best fit ever,"Yes, they are the best-fitting sheets for a thick mattress. No they are not the softest, though they are soft. You can't compare them to the luxury linen brands for softness, but they are nice."
4,It's a binder that works,"I think the headline says it all. I wanted a binder to hold my notes for one of my grad school classes. The tests were open notes, and I needed a binder that could hold all of the powerpoints, papers, figures, etc. The size might have even been a little overkill, but I would rather err on the side of too much. It opens and closes easily. Pages did get stuck a little if I tried to flip through 50 or more at a time which is why I gave 4 stars. There were a few instances during the test when I needed to flip through a lot of material quickly, and I did need to be careful. That being said, this really wasn't a huge deal. It just meant I took 10 seconds to find a page instead of 5, and I doubt other binders are really that much better. Basically, if you want a cheaper binder that will do the job, and do it well, this is a good buy."
5,Best deal I've seen,Really good heavy duty binder for the price. I have spent a lot of money on so-called heavy duty large binders and they tear up too quickly for what the price. This is a really good deal.
5,Durable,"The binder came on schedule; it was brand new, and big enough for lots of office papers. It's durable, nice and worth having if you have lots of papers."
1,Binder rings don't meet and catch the pages.,"I planned to use this to hold my band's music which had become too thick for a 2 inch binder. And the description as ""Heavy-Duty"" sounded good.But I soon realized that in the binder I received the three rings, especially the middle one, did not close completely. So each time I would move the pages to one side or other other they would catch on the slightly open rings. Sometimes this meant that the middle hole of several of the turned pages would pop out of the ring. All in all an unusable product."
2,Plastic Lever Now,I have several of these (4 older same avery# and 3 newer) sadly the new ones no longer come with the metal opening lever. Pictures shown on Amazon are still of the old metal tabbed version not the weak plastic ones that are being shipped in the last few months. The new ones seem more pron to catching pages also when you try to flip more than half an inch of content.
3,Rings starting to have a gap and catch,"I've only had this binder about 3 weeks. At first, the rings stayed tightly closed and I was very pleased. I also LOVE the lever for opening the rings. But, after just a short time, the rings, particularly the middle one as another reviewer mentioned, have started to gap and the pages catch on them. To be fair, I do have the binder full so, perhaps, if you only used it at, say, half capacity, this might not happen. I will probably wind up buying the same model in a 4 inch binder and hope that will work. I do, as I've already mentioned, love the lever."
3,didn't last long,"Shipping was very fast, loved the size and cover pouch. Sadly, the binder's middle ring separated and now catches all my papers. Have to order a new one and will be ordering a different brand, as this lasted one month. Disappointed."
5,Great,"I have been using these caps for about a month and my skin seems smoother and I feel berter, I will definetly order more."
4,I agree ... I would have bought this CD coming out of the movie.,I went to see this movie without a kid and it was worth it. The music was hot. I'm in shock about Britney Murphey being able to sing.The CD is excellent!
4,toe tapping fun,"My kids are 20, 12 and 5. We had a blast at the movie and walked out singing the songs . . . I can hardly wait to get the CD . . . would have liked the entire score, however."
3,The Music is fine,I just don't listen to this very much. There seems to be a lot of indiscernible vocals. I like to hear the words and when I can't I tend to stop listening.
3,It's alright,"Not really the same songs as the movie - or at least not done by the original artists. I paid the money to hear the songs from the movie, not re-done songs by other artists. My children listened to the CD and said, ""This isn't how it was done in the movie!"" There are one or two that were the same, that's the only reason it has a 3-star rating. Very disappointed."
2,Are they kidding??,I do not understand why they brought out this watered down version of the movie sound track. What is the point? They missed out some of the most memorable somgs from the film and some of the most memorable performances. Why? The CD would have been a lot better if they had simply recorded the music from the film and put it on a CD. How hard is that??
4,Just a Note,"Almost everyone I've talked to wanted to listen to the song Seymour, or Fat Joe, sings. It's not on the album, but I thought I'd might as well tell what it is. The song is called ""The Message"", sung by Grandmaster Flash.P.S. Boogey Wonderland is FANTASTIC!!!!"
2,Happy Feet Soundtrack,I was very disappointed in the Soundtrack. I loved the music in the movie along with the tap dancing. Why isn't the CD soundtrack the same thing? Would like to see a CD with all of the original songs with the original singers along with the tap dancing sound with them. That would make my feet dance!MJ Warren
1,Bare foot Music&corny,the covers on this album are a Bad joke. this soundtrack is a Broke take on Moulin Rouge. those kind of soundtracks don't go nowhere&just make a Mockery of the Original songs. the lead off song by Prince shows a Artist who is truly singing with the Fishes. another tired song by him. Vegas Bound&Washed Up.
5,Happy Feet Soundtrack BUY IT NOW!!,I loved the movie and the soundtrack is phenomenal.Great music that makes you want to tap your own feet or do some serious moving!I have already downloaded it to my iTunes.
1,I thought soundtracks to movie reflected....oh let's say...the movie?,The soundtrack is highly disappointing and is a great slap in he face to the voices and spirit of the movie. I wouldn't encourage anyone to purchase this album.
2,A Little Disappointed,I saw the movie a few times and thought the music was awsome. When I purchased the soundtrack I was very disappointed.
2,Good product slow service,I purchased this product for my daughter. She loves the CD but it took so long to get here we forgot we ordered it.
1,"Should be named ""Cover of songs in the movie""","I was so excited about the songs in the movie! When I got the CD, I felt ripped OFF! What is the matter with these soundtrack producers that think we want to hear songs that were in the movie, but not by who did them, or how they were recorded for the actual movie.I liked the funky rapper style that blended so well in the actual movie, but I am getting sick of everything redone trying to appeal to gangstas. I promise to NEVER , ever buy another movie soundtrack without first previewing the songs. As far as I am concerned, I wasted my money. Don't buy this soundtrack if you LOVED the way the music was in Happy Feet.. You'll regret it."
2,It's so-OK if you liked the movie... But this is NOT THE REAL MOVIE SOUNDTRACK!,"If you're a customary soundtrack collector freak, sure you'll be happy with this CD. But, if you're a serious music listener (as I'm sure most of CD NOW customers are) you will find this is another musical sub-product labeled as ""Music From The Motion Picture"", instead of ""ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK From The Motion Picture"".... Well, if you liked that beautiful performance of Queen's ""Somebody To Love"" by Brittany Murphy, or the special version of Stevie Wonder's superhit ""I Wish"" by Patti LaBelle, Yolanda Adams and Fantasia Barrino, plus a very funny 'mash-up' version of Steve Miller's ""The Joker"" (sung by Jason Mraz), with the Bread super-classic ""Everything I Own"" (sung by The Pretenders' superb voice of Chrissie Hynde), get this CD. Otherwise I suggest you to spend extra money, and get the original versions of those songs as performed by the above mentioned supergroups/singers."
4,"Not original, but still really good","My kids realized it wasn't the 'actual' soundtrack (come on, there are music clips to what's on the soundtrack on here so it's not like you others were in the dark when you bought it), but my kids have really enjoyed it anyways. It so upbeat and fun to listen to!"
5,A Major American Poet,"This short book contains every poem that Bogan wished preserved, This is less than 130 short lyrics, some of them only a single stanza, the longest only about 3 pages. Bogan's output seems to be inversely related to the intensity of her work. After reading one of these poems, its hard to imagine that they could have been written any other way. You get the sense that altering a single word would be disfiguring. Some are a bit obscure but definitely repay careful reading. Several poems have great power and many others contain striking language. Bogan deserves to be more widely read."
4,Good phone for a good value,"Pros: light, stays charged for a long time, has speaker phone, a lot of features like voice dialing, 4 people conferencing, web access, etc. Uses smart card. From what I could judge the sound quality is good too. I bought the phone for its price and prepared to get a primitive model. But I got much more.Cons: the buttons are really inconvenient and difficult to press. The ringtones are strange."
1,what knot to buy,way way over the head of the average angler even an advanced angler would not need to tie most of these convoluted knots...........
5,Legal Review,"Great buy! Walked me through ins and outs of legalaties of forming different companies - pros and cons. Author includes relevant websites within the text and information seems very recent and applicable. Although a great resource, be sure to consult legal experts prior to making any big moves. Enjoy and good luck."
3,Found this accidentally,"This book is written by my late Father's psychology professor in the 1940s in Chiropractic College.I met him; he said, ""I have been waiting for you"""
4,"Interesting book, but read other AC works first","First, I am not a Thelemite and never really have been. I also found this material quite dry and obtuse in times. It is obviously written for the Thelemites and makes very little sense when removed from that framework.However, this is still interesting for people who have studied Thelema. Here Crowley offers his thoughts on a wide variety of subjects, from money, to family, to various magical topics. While some of the letters will appeal to Hermeticists and Thelemites alike, many seem to be geared specifically towards the latter. There are, however, a few essays with a more general appeal.All in all, if you enjoy other AC works, this is a good read. If not, then don't bother."
3,"hmm, well if your ready for a ride","Well I know there's a whole organization dedicated to his teachings which is fine, but Crowley never meant for any of his books to be understood, which makes it seem like his books are confusing and scrambled up, there's a reason for that, but you can't argue that with anyone that's wrapped up in him, I personaly think that Crowley was a genius and brought quiet a bit of usefully information to all that inquired in his books.But I think that if you want a more understandable hermetic style way to learn magick without tears or irritation then check out Modern Magick, it's just a great book all in all and he touches on crowley a bunch and really explains alot of things so that there easier to understand,with or without organizations."
3,Overrated,"This book is an excellent introduction to Crowley and his thought, but it is not very profound or informative. We get an interchange of letters between Crowley and one of his followers, who is seeking advice. Written near the end of Crowley's life, it is proof that his struggles with heroin addiction and alcoholism did not seem to affect his intellectual capacities (nor his illusions of grandeur) at all. Although some of his speculations are amusing, most never rise above pseudo-philosophy. i.e., he comes to the conclusion that racism is ridiculous and that crowd mentality rarely rises above the level of its stupidest member, etc. Save your money; it's just a man trying desperately to prove he is somebody by attracting a group of weaklings as his followers. When you fifnish with this tome, you will know no more than when you began."
2,One huge disappointment,"I enjoyed the Ladies Farm so when I heard there was a sequel, I had to get it. However, this book is such a disappointment. I found it boring and shallow. I couldn't like Darlene at all nor anyone else in story other Earl. There wasn't any of the camraderie that existed in the Ladies Farm. There were so many tangents in the story line. Sadly, I can not recommend this book to friends because I found it such a waste of time."
3,No English Subtitles! Shame on Vanguard Cinema!,"Just in case you're wondering, no, this movie does NOT feature English subtitles. It's all in Spanish with no subtitle options. After 20 years of being banned for its subject matter, it's finally back...but still inaccessible for the non-Spanish-speaking world! Too bad. Shame on Vanguard Cinema for not subtitling this long-awaited dvd release!"
5,Good movie,this movie had been prohibited for a long time and finally the TRUTH is out!!! YEY! I am so happy that this movie was created ! Watch it and see where the lie begins! God permitted this movie to go out and I am so happy and grateful
3,For Class,I bought this book for a class I'm taking in college. It was very helpful and informative. Herman discusses several different types of trauma and coping mechanisms.
5,A close analysis of traumatic stress,"In Trauma and Recovery, Herman takes a careful look at traumatic stress and prolonged trauma and redefines post-traumatic stress disorder, leading to one of the most influencial books for psychologists in any area. The book's audience is not, however, limited to the psychological world, for the subject of trauma and its societal impact is one of great importance. Herman is possibly the ultimate source concerning traumatic stress, and this book makes that very clear."
4,Trauma,Book arrived promptly in great condition and was very valuable for my education! I will be keeping it for use in my professional career.
5,The best and most comprehensive book on trauma,I survived child abuse in a lawless third world country and have had a hard time finding books on trauma or child abuse that truly understand the scope of the problem. This book is a gem and I routinely go to it for direction and clarity. Unlike so many other authors Judith Herman truly appreciates the damage and the cycle of abuse and violence . There is no silly nonsense about forgiving or overcoming just true respect for victims.
5,Outstanding insight and clarity for details not thought before,"I cant even begin to explain the beauty of this book. I am a survivor of long term child sexual abuse by a neighbor, my best friends father, that occurred over 7 yrs time, of which then as an adult I was later raped by an ex. I thought the way I was, was just the way I was. I have never encountered such a mind blowing book. This goes beyond the typical abuse book. This is the first book Ive found that didn't make me want to just say Oh whatever, same ole, same ole. I highly recommend this book to ANYone who has ever gone through any kind of abuse and is here to tell about it. Or even someone married or in a relationship with someone who went through any trauma or abuse.I hold this close to my heart and it has encouraged me to have a life that was given to me years ago that Ive never experienced."
5,Trauma and Recovery,"I had a trauma course for my masters program, and ""Trauma and Recovery"" was required reading for the course. I am so glad it was. The book gave excellent interpretations on the symptoms of PTSD. The book provided me with a better understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder without being too clinical. This book made my text book reading on PTSD easier to understand. I kept this book after reading it in my library. It's a great book to revisit."
4,Wash and dry right away!,These were great cookie cutters. Sturdy and cuts clean. Can be used as flowers or snowflakes depending on how you decorate the cookies. But don't be lazy like me and throw them in your sink to wash later. They'll get rusty around the seam.
2,Horny Nicholas Cage,This film had plenty of action but Nicholas Cage just had to ruin it by feeling a bunch of chicks.Not to say that I'm against people getting giggy on the screen but his nonstop horniness has ruined every film.
1,People really enjoyed this film?,"Okay, yes it was kinda fun watching Nicolas go to town as the bad guy. But I'm kinda old fashioned, I like to be able to be listen to the dialoge without cringing, and the in your face forshadowing was a little annoying, no, it was alot annoying! But If you liked ""Con Air"" I guess you will love ""face off"""
2,Way too LOOOOOOOOONG,"This movie started off pretty good, I was ready to sit back and enjoy. But as it progressed, I just wanted it to end! There were Really good action scenes, but they were just sooo loooong. There were several parts of the movie where you thought it would be the end, and it just dragged on into another big oreal. It was pretty hard to sit through, especially those action sequences. Cage and Travolta are geat, they really are. That was the only reason this film gets and extra *star* from me.~Sorry!~LOL~"
1,"Woo, Why ?","It is rather hard to accept an action director who admits to basing his action sequences on Hollywood Musicals of some decades ago.The story is fine, and both Travolta and Cage give masterly performances. However, Woo has no concept of moderation or excess. In one gun battle, that apparently took a sum total of 3 months to complete, Woo seems to be so aware that it is excessive that he cuts the audio, and we hear what the child bystander is hearing.Even the Marine Boat chase turns into a disaster, when the Stand-ins cannot even keep their wigs on straight. Did Woo skip the dailies, or does he like a little farce?It is utterly incomprehensible how such a good story was messed up by Woo's visual hyperbole.This story might actually might have worked in the hands of a better director, or even if the edit could be done by someone with a sense of how an action movie can work.The Highlights are definitely around Cage and Travolta, since they did such great work, but ... Woo ... WHY ????"
1,You gotta be KIDDING,"Obviously the ""action movie"" audience is very much lacking in anything resembling standards. I rented this film after being told how ""awesome"" it was. I found myself alternately laughing at it or wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he made it. The whole premise of the film is a joke. Switching faces? PLEASE! By the time they got to where Nicholas Cage was hanging on to the side of speedboat, basically waterskiing without WATERSKIS, I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. I had expected better after Broken Arrow, which, while quite DUMB, was at least entertaining. I only hope this review will save some poor innocent from buying this monstrosity."
1,"RIDICULOUs ""ACTION"" MOVIE","This director John Woo is viewed as the ""master of action movies"". He is the master of empty movies, and I wonder what is going through the minds of Cage and Travolta, two great actors, in accepting doing an outrageous script like this, always with slow-motion death sequences. Bá!"
1,Face Off? Take my eyes and ears with it!,"I can't stand John Woo films. All his ""action"" sequences are done in such a long, drawn-out, slow motion, way that they become simply painful. They are so slow, they don't feel like action at all. In my opinion, you don't get the feel of the impacts in the way he does things. If you like action that looks and feels like real action, and real stunt work, go for Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx, or Brandon Lee's Rapid Fire, or The Crow."
1,"Monumentally Boring, Monumentally Preposterous","This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. It's not just the silliness of the plot premise, but the massive holes throughout the plot, even if you could accept the premise.And after the 12th slow motion, 10-minute long gun battle scene this thing gets reaaaallllllly boooorrrrrring.Has to be one of the most over-rated films ever."
2,Ummmmm... no.,"Jerry Bruckheimer is pathetic. Slow motion action sequences, Aerosmith music, Two word sentences and unfathomably unrealistic plots/endings. If you like this film you are either five or a moron. 53/100 F"
5,face off,he best movie in the ear 1997 it is perfect action good and adventure good nice acting for john travolta and nice acting for nicolas cage
3,Face / Slightly Off,"Er, it's not *that* good. At the time, the critics went a bit mad and proclaimed this as the greatest action movie of all time, but it isn't. Essentially, John Woo is a superb director of action sequences, but pretty lousy otherwise, and 'Face / Off' suffers from having lots of 'otherwise'. There are only two or three proper, 'Hard-Boiled'-style action setpieces, and for the rest of the film there's an awful lot of talking. Both Cage and Travolta are fine, although the latter seems to be starting to bulge out of his suit,. but the plot is ludicrous, the talky bits go on too long and don't add a great deal to the film, and there's the sense that, even today, Woo is being held back by Hollywood convention. I mean, the last half of 'Hard Boiled' was essentially a long action sequence with no plot, and it worked; but here, there's lots and lots of plot but surprisingly little action. It's influenced a generation of rap videos, though, what with the flapping coats."
4,Awesome Action Flick!,"This movie is an awesome action flick that you can watch over and again. Cage and Travolta play both good guys and bad guys in the movie, and are both terrific in either role. It's a must-see for any action fan."
2,What a disappointment!,"This DVD is such a disappointment! Don't get me wrong, the movie is fabulous, but where in the world are the special features? There's absolutely nothing! Let's face it, a DVD with a whole lot of bonuses is way better than with the movie alone, isn't it?"
4,You Want Action?,"If you want action, this is a great movie for your collection. The two starring roles are acted to perfection. John Travolta and Nick Cage are exceptional in switching mind-sets of their characters. You believe totally each character as they are enlisted under both Good and Evil throughout the film. This movie bases itself on psycological warfare, but backs it up with plenty of physical action. This film is an all-around good action movie. That's why I gave it four stars and it is sitting on my shelves."
4,"Adventure, revenge and happy end!",This is an unusual movie among the same kind of ones. The plot is different and breathtaking. You can not move anywhere throughout the movie. Take it and enjoy the adventure!
5,Hot as Indian curry,"Pigeons flying as bullets scream forward,choirgirls getting pinched on the bottom, Cage cavorting in a trenchcoat, Travolta showing how to stab someone, the sheer incredible plot line which assumes that if you change a face everyone in the world will look the same , and then again pigeons flying about make this one helluva rollercoaster ride. John Woo made a hash of Mission Impossible II but here he is just too much....a Hong Kong film made Hollywood style.And what I liked most about the film was that the message of forgiveness and starting anew which is given at the end of the film..it manages to lift a cool slugfest to something quite special.."
5,One to watch time and time again,"This is a very clever movie. What if you looked in the mirror in the morning and saw your worst enemy staring back at you? John Woo's clever action film takes a sci-fi concept and uses it to tell a very personal story. Face Off is about an FBI agent, played partly by John Travolta (convincing in a serious action role) and partly by Nicholas Cage (again very effective in a tough part). The effects and technology used to achieve the body swap are impressive, but they are really incidental .What makes the movie, and where Woo and the cast show their skill are the huge action set pieces juxtaposed with moments of intimacy. The death of Archer's son at the hands of Troy is particularly well handled, being moving without being maudlin. Care is taken over every shot and the editing makes this even more effective. It's well worth buying because you can watch it again and again and pick up more and more each time."
5,The Greatest Travolta/Cage Action movie ever made.,"John Woo's Special effects filled Violent Masterpiece ""FACE/OFF"" is the film that will defanly rock your world, Travolta and Cage star in this film as twisty characters. Travolta is FBI agent Sean Archer, his son has been assassinated by Hitman Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Years later, Troy is Captured by Archer, after a highspeed chase and getting put outcold by a Ballastic Jet Engine. Only Archer's life is more trouble, only to discover Troy has placed a Bomb somewhere in San Franscoe. (In a Intense scene done by Special effects) The two under Surgery supervison, swap identity's, Archer is Troy, Troy is Archer. Archer is sent to A Futuristic like Prison. And Troy undergoes his plans as Archer. When Archer Escapes, the two battle in the Ultimate violent showdown. The best film about this Futuristic Identity thriller, don't judge it, Just enjoy it. The film should also be called: ""Identity Showdown"""
5,a brilliant edge of the seat action film! cage was amazing!,i thought this film was great! i had never heard of nicolas cage before and i am now a big fan. travolta and cage worked extremly well together and both did well in role reversal. but i have to say i was extremly impressed with nicolas cage's acting i was hooked! the stunts and special effects kept you wanting more and the film had my full attention! there was alot of swearing but that made it more realistic. i would recommend this film to everyone that wants to see a good action film with however a predictable ending! this film gets a definate thumbs up! everyone should see it atleast once!
3,Let's get one thing straight.....,"This was a terribly interesting movie, but it was also the first movie that managed to erase every coherent intelligent thought from my brain. That said, I am sure you can find reviews and summaries for this movie from any of the numerous reviews litering this page, but one must not forget to have a handy book on differential equations, your driver's license, and a napkin to wipe the drool from the corner of your lips close by. OKAY?"
1,Will not be released,Since Paramount is HD DVD exclusive now this movie will NOT be released on Blu-ray. Just get it on HD DVD if you want it!
5,EXCELLENT acting! GREAT action! THIS is the one!,"I think John Travolta and Nicholas Cage show some of their best acting abilities in this movie. The changing of roles from good guy to bad guy, allow you to see these two at their full potential. What makes it great, is that it doesn't interfere with the non-stop action!"
5,Face off is GREAT---WATCH IT,I saw Face Off a few years back and never could get it out of my mind. Then I saw it again a couple of years ago and it still wouldnot get out of my mind. So now I have it to watch all the time. This is great--not only for the actors who play in it but the whole movie is about someone putting another persons face on them and the other person putting the first persons face on him. Wild to say the least. You get so caught up in this movie you forget who is who and get into the flow of the movie. It carries you away and it is so good because there are not alot of movies now that really carry you away from reality. I highly recommend this for an evening of really great action and it will keep you on the edge of your seat
5,Face/Off,"John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, and director John Woo strike platinum in this thriller and heavy action movie. A must-see movie for audiences who love wild action, and a little chill to thrill their emotions. This a awesome movie with some heat."
5,"Face-Off vs. ""Abduction""","My comments pose more of a question than a movie critique. I urge anyone who reads this to explore the painting ""Abduction of the Daughters of Leucippus."" The reason for this inquiry is such...the two fellows are twin brothers. One is Castor and the other is Pallox. Being in an art history class and hearing this for the first time today...I decided to try the web to see what I could find. If you have any suggestions, information or opinions...please send them to me at ""BTE8816@students.ssu.edu"" or ""YthLDr001@aol.com""Thank you very much and happy hunting"
4,Not bad.......,"the story line of this movie isn't the best i've seen in my life but i have to say it had some pretty nice action, there's tons of language in it and lots of explotions! over all i would say not a must see but an ok movie to go watch on a weekend with the 18+ group....."
5,A stunning film.,"This is the best action movie I have ever seen.EVER.The plots good,the action is even better and it's thrilling from start to finish. The acting's also brilliant and the characters have LOT'S of depth.Go Woo,go."
5,One of the best action movies ever made,Most action movies lack originality and good acting but this has both . Both Travolta and Cage are brilliant and the surporting cast are also great . John Woo directs some of the most brilliant action sequences to set foot on film . They are tremendous . The dialogue is at most times good and the SFX scenes are great . So if your looking for a action packed shoot anything that moves action movie with brains then this is for you . Dont miss it .
4,great movie,"The best part about this movie is you get to see both the actors as hero and villian. John and Nicholas acted so nicely, that the idea of whole face/off surgical theme didn't look silly or matter much. Two great actors at their best..."
1,Almost as bad as The Jackal!,"The Jackal with Gere and Willis was the worst picture I have ever seen. If you liked The Jackal you will like Face/Off. Lots of action, dumb dialog, stupid plot...just plain boring."
1,It's too bad I couldn't give it a fat 0,By far the worst movie I've ever seen ... how are people so stupid that they like this? Depresses me about the human condition.
1,The dumbest plot I've ever seen!,"""Face/Off"" was so stupid that I didn't even care what happened to the characters.....if one killed the other that would've been good but if they both committed suicide then that would've been MUCH BETTER......When in society do you take the risk of being someone ""else"" in order to catch a killer.......the guy was in prison but he wanted to ""trade places"" what a stupid plot! This was surely a waste of my money!"
2,NOT TITO,"My favorite scene in this whole very bad movie was when all of John Travoltas cop buddies were killed and all he says is ""Not Tito?"" Who was Tito anyway? If for some strange reason that make a Face Off 2, I do beleive they should call it ""Not Tito 2"".The other big thing that annoyed me about this film, was how John Travoltas family touched each others faces. At first I would imagine it would be sweet, but after a while I would just have to say ""Stop Touching my face""."
4,John Woo's last good film,"After making two horrible films in America(""Broken Arrow"" and ""Hard Target""), I thought Woo was over with and sold out to Hollywood but then came ""Face/Off."" Remember when you see a John Woo film, you really have to suspend your disbelief. Yes, the plot is tacky, yes the acting is cheesy, yes all the action scenes are unbelievable. You have to enjoy Woo's films at Art. No one else in Film can make a violent action scene look so beautiful and arty. With ""Face/Off,"" Woo goes back to his Hong Kong action film roots. Though not as good as the classics like ""A Better Tomorrow"" and ""The Killer,"" ""Face/Off"" still is better than his previous American films and what Woo is doing now. This film is worth your time and remember to find all John Woo's Hong Kong films at your video store."
3,O.k,Not bad but John Woo has done better. It is really spaced out beetween action scenes.Just rent it.
4,Refreshing,"The ridiculously over-the-top storyline was a joy to watch, not to mention one of the best directorial performances I have ever seen. The way Jon Woo sees scenes is totally different to anything I've seen before, and really refreshing. Can't finish without mentioning the great acting performances by Cage and Travolta, who slip into each other's characters masterfully and with style."
5,Face Off,really loved it/ #u gotta get it. i saw the movie years ago and i forgot most of the movie. One day my sister told me about it again so i had 2 get it.
5,SPECTACULAR!!!!!,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS MOVIE 100,000,000 STARS BUT UNFORTUNETLY I COULD ONLY GIVE IT 5. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE! JOHN TRAVOLTA AND NICHOLAS CAGE ARE NO DOUBT, SPECTACULAR. THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND ALWAYS."
1,Did not work!,"I was not able to experience the movie. The DVD sent to me did not work on any of my equipments. So I was refunded of my money. I ordered from iTunes , because I really wanted to watch this movie. This was the first time I had experienced this problem."
4,its john woo what more do you want :D,"After Hard Target and Broken Arrow another american movie with the action movie master director in the director chair.have a plenty of guns, bullets, winds, doves and slow motion, mix them perfectly, chill for a while and voila you have a great action film only Mr Woo can deliver.a must see for his fans and wanna be action movie directors :D"
4,"Good action, fun, and most of all exciting!","This film I would reccomend to anyone who loves action. Not as good as say the classic ""The Terminator"" but will definatley satisify anyone who's in the mood for good action."
5,an outrageous film that joins travolta and cage together....,I only could say that it's the outrgeous films ever..
3,Off and Running,"In John Woo's orgy of action Face/Off, mega-men of the moment John Travolta and Nicolas Cage get to play with each other's mind and mugs. It's a big enough thrill to see these two dead-on dynamos mixing it up on the big screen, but the kicker is they get to play each other--two Vegas impressionists in a lethal game of cat and mouse. And those demanding blood and guts know that Woo rarely disappoints. Though the climax is too long in coming, the stars make this picture. And if you're keeping score, Travolta does an awfully good Cage, wide-eyed and slow of voice. His performance alone makes Face/Off a fanciful, edgy thriller."
3,John Woo loves his fire works! ;-),Not a bad film if you haven't seen it before but if you have then you begin to realize how rediculous the whole story actually is (plus over the top fire-works displays!) and the movie just seems to drag on until a more than welcome end.
5,face off dvd,"Excellent DVD and arrived in perfect condition. Packaging was great and the DVD arrived well before the promised date. Played it the first night it arrived and several times since.. As stated earlier, it was in great shape and the movie is very good."
5,Amazing,This movie it's a moust have.I have seen it so many times and this blu-ray version is awesomeThanks a lot.
4,"Woo makes a great ""Face Off""","I've not been too pleased with some of John Woo's American films as compared to the HK movies he did formerly but this one is a rare exception. Free of studio tampering, ""Face Off"" is a tour de force for the director and the two lead actors, Travolta & Cage. I've seen this on Standard def than I rented the HD DVD version and what a difference!! If you want someone to notice the advantages of Hi-Def over standard, play them this disc! The visuals have a depth of field unequalled to none (maybe Batman Begins perhaps) and the sonics are out of this world to boot! I am definitely buying a copy of this in HD DVD before they're gone. I recommend this to owners of HD DVD machines as well."
3,"Bad Acting, great action scenes.","John Travolta plays someone who he isnt in this movie, and frankly I dont know if he knew who he was supposed to act like. In my opinion, ive seen Travolta act in many movies quite well, but both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage put on the most terrible attempts at acting like the person they are trying to imitate. In short Travolta looked stupid trying to act like Nicholas Cage and vice versa. However, I loved the action scenes in the movie. If your a critic about acting style and replay value than stray away from here. If your an action junkie, this film will blow your socks off. Ive never seen so many guns going off at the same time since Predator. That made it worth it, though I was fast forwarding through the rest of the dialogue."
3,Could have been better,"I gave this one 3 stars because beyond the shoot em ups and special effect, there was no story. Cage did a much better job in acting than Travolta, aka, Barbarino. Some movies I would view again but this one, no. Travolta was better in ""Broken Arrow"" and Cage was better in, what was that movie about the raid in the prison and the lethal poison gas weapon. hmmm., don't remember."
5,"For high pace action, this is a must see for action fans.","With this film, John Woo has established himself in the movie industry as one of the best directors when it comes to action. He chose his cast carefully. John + Nicolas = Blockbuster"
5,Mind Blowing DTS Sound !!,"Watching this movie in DTS 6.1 surround sound is truly an amazing experience. I already had a single DISC edition of this movie, butwhen two-disc edition was released, I couldn't resist myself andadded it to my collection."
3,More visually stunning than violent,"I usually stay far away from mindlessly violent movies. Although it's kind of a Terminator II where a former villian acts like the hero, it is really beautifully photographed. The film is very stylized and I have to say that Nicolas Cages' outfits in the beginning were some of the best villian's costumes I've seen on a man while being very masculine. I thought I'd be squeamish when they exchanged faces but it actually wasn't that bad. Actually, no worse than the scene in Terminator where he repairs himself. It was more fascinating. It makes you wonder, could we someday get to that point where we could do face transplants?"
5,Review for Face/Off,I love Nicolas Cage and John Travolta movies and they really out did themselves on this movie. It's a great movie to watch.
5,Awesome Movie,"This was a great movie, I loved the transition with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. Very well thought out movie."
5,Engagingly Impressive!,"Sean Archer (Travolta) has been chasing Castor Troy (Cage) to avenge his son's death by the hands of the psychotic terrorist for six years. Now that he killed Castor, Sean must find a biological bomb by assuming the identity of Castor Troy by taking his face and being brought in prison. But Troy, who awakes from his coma, takes Archer's face in order to take revenge on him. Now, Troy turns Archer's life upside down by assuming his identity. Will Archer break free from his prison and get his face back, or will Troy have the last laugh ?Face/Off is a smart, engagingly impressive film that you won't be able to take your eyes. Nicholas Cage puts on an extremely impressive performance as does the almighty John Travolta. The direction from John Woo shows definite effort, this is one of his best films.Face/Off is a watchable and brilliant film that will keep you entertained until the credits roll. It is certainly one of the better action/thriler's of 1997."
5,Thank YOU!,"I am so happy with my dvd. Not only is it a great movie, the seller got it to me super fast!"
5,"""Be all you can be!""","These vibrant stories of such phenomenal women who Dared to be Different and accomplished such awesome feats against so much adversity will inspire you to reach higher goals, regardless of any obstacles of the times! These outstanding women are incredible to study and this book is an excellent volume of heroism and unique personalities! Kudos!"
4,"Trailblazers:Twenty Amazing Western Women,","This is a terrific look at women who have shaped our country's growth and direction but are always left out of those mythical History classes we have in school. There are some familiar names as well as the names of aviation pioneers and other modern unsung heroines. Each chapter is a delightful short story that has obviously been well researched. Worth the read for women and men, a must for every young girl."
3,A Great Idea that Needs More Work,"In this book, Starhawk aims to provide a much needed anchor to the Pagan community--to remind us that we are part of the surrounding eco-system and that the basis of any ""Earth-based"" spirituality should be the Earth itself, instead of abstraction and symbolism.However, she advocates this through presenting rituals that involve a minimal amount of observing or understanding nature...and focus instead on abstraction and symbolism.She also reiterates the role of humanity as ""caretakers of the Earth"", which always inmplies a degree of separation from the natural world, and places us above it.That said, her rituals and meditations are beautiful, but if you _really_ want to connect to the world around you, why not study the mystery and beauty of nature for what it is, instead of how it relates to you?"
4,Enlightened64,I purchased this book based on the fact that I have read the Spiral Dance by this author. I look forward to reading it.
2,not for adults,"Unfortunately this is not an encyclopedia and dictionary with student aids, but student programs with the encyclopedia added on. You must wade through all kinds of homework, math, etc. programs to reach the dictionary and encyclopedia. Microsoft apparently thinks that after you leave school you can never have need of an encyclopedia or dictionary again. Also once you load it on, you cannot turn it off. It will run forever on the grounds that you might have to look up something. Once you do get in, the interface is harder to move around in than in the old 2004 edition."
1,Microsoft has poor customer service,"After waiting on the phone for 15 minutes, transferred twice, one dropped call, and another 15 minute call, I finally learned that this product is not available for purchase at any retail outlet and only available for download. This is not a good option when searching for gift giving ideas. The product seems very impressive. However, the current distribution method via internet download only, at first may seem to be convenient actually diminishes convenience when it is not available for potential customers wishing to purchase through traditional retail outlets (including internet purchase). Competing products, though of lesser quality and appeal, have gained my patronage simply because of availability. Overall, my experience with trying to buy a Microsoft product has been terrible. Buy Britannica."
3,Just Ok.,"So far I'm not impressed. Encarta offers very little extra than what can be found independently online. Also, we have Microsoft Office and my daughter, an 8th grader, already has a good understanding of how Powerpoint, Excel, and Office work so she doesn't need the templates and tutorials to help with school assignments. Most students are taught how to use Powerpoint, Word,and Excel in school computer classes. I guess Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2008 might be beneficial to someone with very little knowledge of Microsoft Office and who needs assistance in creativity as far as reports are concerned. However, if you have a strong student with a fair amount of backround using Word, Powerpoint and Excel, this would be a waste of money."
1,microsoft student,The progam is too advance for an elementary school student and that information is not mention on none of the product description this product is design for a college student. I will not recommended to any other parent. the software is too complecated and not userfriendly at all and homework help there is none
3,Shoot the French Horns,"I am a huge Barbirolli Mahler fan. His 6th is frightening. The good news on this recording is that the sound is great. The bad news is that the playing isn't great. The strings are sloppy, but unforgivably the French Horns flub entrance after entrance, movement after movement, and are out of tune the most of the rest of the time. The end of the first movement is particularly horrifying. The piece was recorded in one day, but still was there not enough time to fix such terrible errors? Skip this one."
4,Excellent 1960's recording,"The sound quality of this recording is surprisingly pleasing for being over 40 years old. Barbirolli certainly 'got' Mahler, as is demonstrated in his several excellent recordings. This Mahler 4th is right up there with Barbirolli's Mahler 9th and 5th, recorded with the Berlin Philharmonic. One can collect close to a'complete Mahler symphonies' conducted by Sir John, although you'll have to accepta couple performed by the less-than-excellent Halle Orchestra to get there. This oneis well worth owning."
1,Don't do it. It's not worth it,You know this is a bad instrument if they call it a trumpet! It literally says its a trumpet in the product description. Made in china garbage.
4,Beltran Goes Hollywood,"Tito Beltran, in my mind, is one of the best young tenors in today's opera world. His latest release impressed me so much, that I am ready to forget that guy named Cura! Beltran's upper register is powerful yet in control. My favorite pieces on the disc were the Lanza tunes. Beltran paid a great homage to Lanza with beautiful vocals on ""Be My Love"",""Because"",""Because You're Mine"", and ""The Loveliest Night Of The Year"". Most of the arias were sung straight forward with only one standout as far as I am concerned. ""Au fond du temple saint"" from Bizet's ""Les Pecheurs de Perles"" is lovely duet with baritone Jonathon Summers. Beltran's Spanish version of Celin Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" is the closing effort on the disc and much to my surprise I actually like his version better that Celin's. The difference being Tito actually shows some emotion in the song. Well done Maestro Beltran. The overall sound is good and the orchestration is superb!"
5,Brilliantly sensational!,"I was at the Conservatory of Music in Gothenburg, Sweden when Tito entered the Opera School there. For some reason there was an academic conflict but he then proved himself outside the academy and made a name for himself directly in concert and opera houses. After his controversial competition in Wales, gave birth to a brilliant and exciting Tenor sensation in the 21st century. This recording is a must for all Tenor lovers! He displays rich and warm tonal colors that touches the essence of human emotion, and covers different stylistic demands in today's repertoire. The orchestra and chorus are indeed splendid and a joy to hear. You'll never get tired listening to this recording. The best Mario Lanza ever, with a powerful upper register. Knowing Tito, I sometimes wonder where the voice is coming from. Du e skitbra, Tito!"
2,Need an equalizer,"There's no doubt that Tito Beltran has a great voice and this CD shows off his talent over a wide variety of songs. However, there seems to be a problem with the settings between his voice and the orchestra in the mix-down of the recording. On some of the tracks, the music seems to be too loud that makes him sound like singing from the back of the orchestra. The somewhat strange mixer setting also makes his high notes sound struggling and tight besides causing some tracks sound like overdubbed. I have tried playing this CD on audiophile hi-fi systems as well as cheap portables and the results are the same. The situation is especially bad in Mi Corazon Continuara (My Heart Will Go On). This can, however, be corrected using an equalizer to enhance the mid-range frequencies (especially the 1000Hz - 2500Hz range) of the audio spectrum. Doing so also brings his voice back to the front where the singer should be standing."
5,Southern Living Review,"I got this subscription for my wife. The first issue has not yet arrived, but I know she will enjoy it. The $5 price could not be beat."
1,Magazine subscription,"I am still waiting for my first copy, so it is impossible to rate. Will gladly rate when I do receive."
1,yet to arrive,"We have yet to receive our first copy of Southern Living, due this month. If and when we do, will be happy to review it.So far, it earns a zero."
3,sharing home,"Since Southern Living is a regional magazine it tells you things concerning that area. Recipes, planting, home decorating and much more, you can find many new items. My daughter really likes the set-up of pages. Keep it coming. Amazon has really come through with a great rate and just in time for my early Christmas shopping."
5,my favorite,Southern Living has always been one of my favorite magazines. i especially enjoy the decorating tips and good recipes. When I managed a country club for many years I always did the menus for the dining room and I would submit a recipe for the kitchen that I had not tried but knowing that they were always good I had no problem doing so. When I moved outside Chicago from SC I continued my subscription and when I told a next door neighbor about it for she loved to cook I was amazed that someone way back had sent her the magazine as a gift and she has kept getting it all these years. This was a nice offer as everyone is looking for a bargain these days. so thanks- Evelyn allred
2,"Agreed, it is not what it used to be","I was given a gift subscription. I have read this magazine for years. I, too, enjoyed the receipes. Somewhere along the way, whether it be staff changes or intentional cost-cutting, the magazine is barely worth getting anymore. It's too bad, it had brand recognition; it was respected and talked about. Now, it is just another ""rag"". Times do change, but what is the replacement alternative? Anyone find one?"
2,Not Worth the Price,"I would never renew my subscription unless it was less than a dollar per issue. There are just too many ads and articles useless to me. I'll read it at the supermarket, book store or online if I find something catches my eye."
5,A favorite for years!,"Superb recipes, interesting features, and a true sense of the Southern lifestyle. As a transplanted New Orleanian, I look forward to receiving my Southern fix every month."
4,Roped in by new format,"Having grown up in the South, I remember Southern Living as the top magazine read and adored by all the women in my life. However, for the last decade or more, to my adult eyes the magazine always seemed dowdy and boring every time I visited home and browsed the stack of issues on my mother's coffee table. My mother-in-law just left a recent copy with me after a trip out West to visit us, and I was surprised to find how much I was loving it as I read through it... then turned to the editor's page and (Voila!) read about the new format, etc.! I can testify to the success of that new format; hence, I am here ordering a subscription for myself!"
3,money beggers,"I bought the ""year for $5"" deal, should have known better! The bill comes, its' $10 for 2 years, OK,so I paid it. Now about once every 2-3 months I can count on another offer, a deal that can't be turned down,ect. All of this is my fault, I dropped this mag before for the same begging tactics, too bad really,because they really do have a good read. Oh well, 2 years of a good read and alot of junk mail!"
1,Heartbreaking,So sad. I could read the old Southern Living Mags forever and over and over again. I leaf through the new ones in less than 15 minutes. And have no desire to return. Will never subscribe to SL again. What a huge disappointment. The heart is gone from this grand old publication.
5,Wonderful All Purpose Home Guide,"I've enjoyed Southern Living off and on for years, but had to renew with the low low Amazon price. This magazine is not simply for those of us lucky enough to live in the South, but offers wonderful takes on old, new and ""light"" recipes, many home decorating ideas, and especially, gardening. It's a great combination of several magazines with it's own twist of Southern Charm. I would highly recommend this magazine (and their online website) to folks all over the country. Oh, don't let me forget about their suggestions for getaways -- weekend or lengthy stays. They truly highlight the beautiful and interesting places to go in the South from Texas to Maryland."
4,Watch for the auto renewal issue,"I was not aware of the auto renewal policy when I purchased this magazine, however, Southern Living is a really fine product, so I did not fuss about it. I do wish it would have been clear or plain to see that auto renew was also involved."
2,"Advertizement, advertizement","I have been a customer of Southern Living for at least 35 years. I was excited every month to see the beautiful photos and write-ups about places to visit. We did visit many of the places because of Southern Living...Somehow, I had been unaware that the Southern Living model was changing. When the first issue arrived...I thought it was a promo for a up-coming issue. I was not sure which was a write-up and which was an ad. Seemed much lighter...maybe paper being used is lighter.Anyway, I realize that Southern Living, just like all of us, has to cut back. In this economy, I had rather put up with some semblance of Southern Living than none at all. Southern Living has made the magazine into an affordable subscription.Perhaps they could use some of the old make up of the Southern Living, and we would feel a greater connection.I intend to support Southern Living; otherwise, it would seem as it a giant symbol of our culture had fallen."
2,Bdah!,"For several year I had been a Better Homes and Gardens subscriber. I decided to change to Southern Living because I'm from the south and... the magazine subscription was $5.00. I just received the magazine and it's OK. Yes, just OK. BHG is better, but not great either (it used to be better and had more articles which is one of the reasons why I decided to try this one).For $5.00 the subscription is OK. I would not pay more for it."
3,"Love the Magazine, Hate the Billing!","This is one of my favorite magazines of all times, but since receiving the first issue, I am now receiving bills indicating a payment due. Maybe this good deal on Amazon.com is not as advertised!"
2,Not what it used to be,"Like a lot of magazines (and other things), Southern Living is not what it used to be. The cost cutting really shows. The magazine is smaller, less glossy, and the articles have no substance. The recipes are reduced to few, and with a couple of exceptions they don't even look good to eat. It's worth about $5 a year, which is what it's selling for here. It's a shame."
4,Southern Living,I have always enjoyed Southern Living magazine. I don't feel that they put enough recipes in the newer issues as they have in the past. The recipes are what keeps me subscribing.
1,I think I got taken,I still haven't seen a magazine and I think I've been taken. Don't waste your money on this vendor. It's a con. I wish I could have given NO STARS.
4,SL review,I think to really enjoy any media is the feeling that it leaves you with.This magazine makes me want to try the receipts and visit the places described not to mention the good photography-all in good taste!I don't save magazines but this magazine has that one quality- I've saved some back issues!
5,the bible of southern reading,Interesting articles and good recipes for all living in the South. Up to date and fun places to visit . . .
3,good magazine,"I have always liked this magazine but I have not seen it in retail stores lately. So, I signed up for a subscription through Amazon and got a really good deal. When I recently started receiving the magazine, I realized that it has changed a little bit. It seems the publisher made some modifications to the magazine, itself, like the page size, thickness of paper, thickness of the magazine, etc. It even seems like there are a few more ads. At least, it is a little different but at least the same type of information is still in the magazine."
5,WE LOVE IT!,This is a great gift for my daughter-in-law. She loves the magazine and the auto-renewal makes it an easy gift-giving choice for me!
1,:o(,"I don't remembersusbscribing to this, but if I did, I only have two. I forget how many I was supposed to get in one year."
3,"Would have been 5 stars, but....",I can not tell you in a few words how much I love Southern Living. I would have rated it with 5 stars but sorry I just can't do it. Out of 12 issues I might have actually received 3 issues. They just never came. I ordered subscriptions for my sister and daughter and theirs arrived just fine. But not mine. I ended up just giving up and canceling the subscription. I miss the couple of issues I did get terribly. But it's not worth the money to never actually get the magazine. They are hard to find in stores in my area so it's a huge loss for me.
1,still dont have the magazine,I subscribed 5 weeks ago and still do not have the magazine very unhappy with the service from this magazine
2,No Improvement Needed,"Having been a subscriber for 14 years I can only say that the new changes are not for the better. New subscribers will never know what they have missed.....but us old timers have lost faith. Who said Southern Living needed to be changed? Shame on those who took a delightful magazine from wonderful to wanting. You should have asked the readers.........we would have shared our positive thoughts with you before you took this ""improved?"" approach."
1,Still waiting,"I have yet to recieve my first issue, I ordered on 8/25/09.It appears to be a long time, but hoping to see it by November!"
1,I don't know,Well as of 10/11/09 I have not received this magazine so I couldn't tell you if I liked it or not.
1,Southern Living,I received my first issue on October 24 which is the November issue. The magazine is great but my subscription expires next September. This means I've been shorted an issue. This magazine was ordered in late August. Very poor customer service and an issue short
1,Southern Living,"My review is that I can not yet have a review. I still have not received my subscription. I am familiar with the product and love it, but I should have received it by this time."
1,Not yet received!,We have not yet received the first copy of this magazine. I would certainly like to know what happened to my subscription!
1,still haven't received 1st issue,"Although I purchased Southern Living magazne (which I do love) @ the end of December 2009, it is now the middle of February and I have still yet to receive my 1st issue!"
1,Subscription has not yet begun delivery,"This was purchased in late November, and although a short delay was expected, I assumed it would have begun delivery by now. (January 30th)The magazine may be great, but I cannot determine if it is so slow to arrive. (2 months already)"
3,Southern Living Subscription,I am looking forward to receiving the magazine and am surprised it hasn't been sent yet. That is my only disappointment.
1,NEVER RECEIVED ONE MAGAZINE!!!!,I PLACED A 1 YEAR SUBSCRIPTION ORDER FOR SOUTHERN LIVING IN FEBRUARY AND IT IS NOW AUGUST AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE MAGAZINE YET!!!
1,have not recieved item,"My credit card was charged for the item on Aug 24, 2009 and I have not recieved the first issue as of Oct 9, 2009"
1,Southern Living disappointment,Today is November 14 and we have yet to receive an issue or even an acknowledgement.
4,Wish there were more of it,"I've been reading Southern Living since my teens and loved it for its recipes, home features and beautiful pictures about the South. My new subscription simply leaves me wanting MORE - because the issues barely crack 100-135 pages, which is disappointing. Everything from recipes to decorating to severely edited travel stories seems skimpy. Too bad for such longevity, tradition and a niche concept. I give my rating for the content and production quality but again, there's just not enough of it."
5,Delightful,I love cooking and always find several recipes that I want to try in each issue. People at my monthly potluck are requesting my recipes.
2,For the wife,"I ordered this for my wife. She loves the magazine, but Southern Living changed the name on the subscription to the woman that lived here before. We can't help them understand that person is no longer here."
2,Southern Living,I have yet to receive this magazine. Others ordered at the same time have been received. What's up?
4,good 4th grade book for home,This book is very close to what my child is using in school. Someone asked me if I can get a math book for her to help her kids study at home. This is much cheaper than a real text book.
5,Very please with book purchased on Amazon.,"I am very please with this book I use in homeschooling my daughter. I use other supposedly complect curriculium, but they do not include science and social studies. Also this Comprehensive Curriculumn is more colorful and my child is eager to do her school work.Shipping of this product was prompt and in wonderful condition. Thankyou"
4,Older edition,"I got the older edition, not the one pictured here. You should check the publication date if you want to make sure you get the new one."
2,He's lost it,Once again I held up my hopes for John Squire's new material. and once again I've been let down. This album is only slightly better than The Seahorses album. I have only listened to this twice but don't feel any urge to go back to it again.The songs are nice and the arrangements are nice. The playing of Mr.Squire is as good as you'd expect. But there's nothing here to separate it from any other Brit-Poppy type bands.
3,Hard to Crank,"Not bad for an emergency light, but the crank is very uncomfortable to use, especially if you have to use the crank for any length of time."
4,"Rechargeable - great, crank power - a disappointment","I think its a nice little lantern - compact, good radio and the light is decent. I bought one after a power outage at the beginning of this year and I've been using it on a daily basis since it arrived. I love my garrity crank flashlight but I am disappointed in the lantern. The lantern runs a long time off a charge but takes a lot of cranking to keep even a dim light once the battery runs down. Then the little knob broke off the crank so now its just a rechargeable. I think it can be fixed but haven't followed up on that yet."
2,Not very practical,"In terms of practical use in blackout/emergency conditions, this lantern didn't work well for me. Although the radio is very good sound quality, the lantern isn't very bright to light a room in a blackout, and also only lasts for 6 minutes on a 1 minute crank. Since we were out of power all night, it got really tiring to crank every 5 minutes."
4,Lantern,"Battery life seems to be pretty good, but the crank doesn't last too long. The light is very bright though."
4,A necessary and compelling film,"This is a film that teaches us two things. One, the most obvious, is that 9/11 was en event of catastrophic proportions which shook our lives in an unprecedented way. The second, and most important one is that there are filmmakers who have the courage to expose problems created by the handling of the events by the authorities. Director Maria Pusateri has done that. She had the courage to speak through her film and show us how unfair society can be to its heroes. And how unfair and selfish we all are in forgetting the unforgettable. In my opinion 9/11 should be shown in all its aspects to these and future generations, forever. This film should be included in every curriculum."
3,Beautiful shoes,"They are nice shoes with real leather but seem not flexible with my feet. When I take a long-walking, they seem a little tight and make me feel kind of hurt. They're good for smaller feet."
1,Plastic tilt breaks after one use,"The pole is powder-coated aluminum, but the plastic part that is used for the tilt mechanism breaks with a minor wind, rendering the entire umbrella useless. Don't buy."
1,Don't buy!,I sent back the first umbrella because the carring case strap was broken. Amazon quickly sent a replacement umbrella but I can not get the tilt mechanism to work. The tilt mechanism button will not depress inward allowing for the umbrella to tilt back.
3,Sun or No Sun - 5 Star Umbrella!,System wouldn't let me edit star rating to 5 STARS! THIS UMBRELLA WAS PERFECT! Used it at 4 different types of FL beaches and it held up well. Piled sand around anchor and lined up cooler against umbrella pole for extra support on a very windy day. The air vents were great too. Took advice from previous reviews and DID NOT use tilting mechanism and don't plan on it. Instead did what other beachers did and that was they tilted pole when they put anchor and umbrella in the sand to start. Don't need to tilt then. Loved it and it saved us lots of $$$ each day so we didn't have to rent one. Also seemed 10 degrees cooler underneath (90 degree days).
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered this umbrella, and when it arrived it was broken, it took the company forever to finally send me a new one...which had a torn seam, and when I emailed again to complain, noone responded, until I complained to Amazon, and filed a complaint.....definately would not order!!"
1,erreur,ce cd est de MARIA CALLAS pas certainement de lauri e regina(???)1 etoile va a qui ecrive cettes sottises.merci !!!
4,Great world music journey,"This is a fine, budget-priced sampler from the fabled Belgian indie label, Crammed Discs. Balkan, Brazilian, African and Arabic music coalesce and ferment together. If you like hearing sounds that are challenging and new, this disc will be a great delight, and may spur you on to explore any number of artists and styles. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack - Slipcue music reviews)"
1,This movie was worse than anything I've seen yet,"I'll agree with the other 2 so far - this was the worst movie ever.They didn't even try to cover up the fact that the Jackie Chan parts were spliced in, and the quality is horrible besides... save your money! There's a guy that can break shovels with his neck. The bad guy eats apples. What more could you want? Deserves to be burned"
1,Sheer is an understatement,"These are perfect if you don't plan on wearing them. The instant I put them on, they started snagging on my dry skin and now look terrible. Not impressed with the quality."
2,"Slow service, no communication","No order acknowledgment, no notification of shipment, from time of order to receipt was over two weeks."
4,an informal tone for a broader audience,"There are many ways to teach calculus. Typically, for maths majors, a rigorous epsilon-delta approach has been favoured. So we get the classic texts by Spivak, Apostol and Marsden, for example. But a problem is that this approach often turns off many students who need a firm understanding of calculus and classical analysis. They may not be maths majors. Instead, they could be majoring in engineering or the physical sciences. So Bagby offers them a more informal approach.He does not deprecate rigour. But by presenting his narrative in a casual way, he gains the flexibility in recasting important concepts of proofs in a way understandable to more readers.Even maths majors may want to consider having his text, as a backup to their more formal books. Because sometimes the arguments given in the latter's proofs can be very difficult to understand and generalise."
4,We've Been There,"I really enjoyed ""How Winter Comes to the Copper Coutry"". I used to live in the area and his poems reflect what the area is like. His characters are colorful and remind me of the people I knew who lived there. The poems remind of familiar people and surroundings, but they are described and seen in new and different ways. It is a very enjoyable book!"
1,Totally implausable,"I bought this book on the strength of other reviews. Bah! It was so bad I couldn't finish it. I read tons of fan fiction (this book being one such example), and I wouldn't even read it for free online. I never bought the character's motivations or actions. For something about presidential politics that's a better read, try Madam President."
1,Terrible book,"This book is horrible. The writings are convoluted and obscure. Some of the more classic writings (i.e. Socrates, Plato, etc.) are worth reading. The rest are boring and hard to understand."
1,worst,"it arrived on time and i gave a good review . i had just had neck surgery and was unable to install it . after healing i went to put it in and none of the connectors fit . when a company says easy installation and fits all foriegn and domestic models i assumed it did . i contacted them but was told to call tech support . there's no point . i'm past return time and i'm not tearing into my car to install it . i thought i could disconnect one antenna and replace it with what i asked for , a replacement for a 1998 sable . you can't remove one and install the other so i wouldn't say easy instalation . sometimes you just bite it ."
3,Great Film for a Small Price,"I won't go into too much detail about The Street Fighter as a film. I enjoyed it and feel that any fan of the martial arts should add this title to their collection. The fight scenes are -- in a word -- BRUTAL.But instead of going on about the merits of the film, I will instead review The Street Fighter as a DVD. The picture quality is amazingly clear considering the film is so cheaply priced. There's even a Japanese language track in addition to the competent English dub. However, the DVD Audio Set-up menu incorrectly refers to it as Chinese. Also, the Japanese voices do not sync with the mouth movements and there are no subtitles, so watching the film in its original language is a chore even for those who do understand Japanese. There are some other extras on the DVD which seem out of place and irrelevant, but they do add to the ""value"" of such a budget priced disc. All in all, I recommend this particular DVD edition of The Street Fighter"
5,Sonny Chiba kicks... and takes names. Part 1,"When I first heard of the Street Fighter I was skeptical. I saw this DVD and it was cool. It had Soony Chiba as a hired help named Terry Tsurugi. When Terry finds out that he was used by the Yakuza(Japanese Mafia), they try to stop him at all costs. Easier said than done, Terry kicks the living daylightrs out of every body that gets in his way even knoking out one guy's teeth,ripping out a guy's viocebox, and tearing off another guy's balls. To put it plainly Chiba is a more vicious Bruce Lee. The visions of him ripping his enemy's limbs off are cool. He teaches the Yakuza a lesson they won't sure forget. No gang can take on Terry and survive. Beat him if you can, survive if he lets you, which he rarely does. This is not for the weak of heart. Fans of Bruce Lee will surely become fans of Sonny Chiba. I highly recomend this movie. The origional Street Fighter was rated X when it was first realesed in the U.S."
4,Back in the antihero heyday...,"As far as I know, this was the first kung fu movie whose main character was a jerk, a far far FAR from admirable guy who used his martial arts to help out crime synidcates and other thugs. Terry Tsurugi is most loyal to whoever has the biggest bank account. The movie opens with him helping a guy break out of prison because he was hired by the guy's brother and sister. When Terry kills the brother and sells the sister into a prostution ring, the convict comes after him for revenge. There are lots of other plots twists as this crazy movie throws in basically everything but the kitchen sink. Some of the fight scenes are really dumb and cheesy, but what do you expect??? REALISM??? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!! This is a fun ride of a flick."
3,Classic karate movie,"Sonny Chiba is great. As the title suggests the fighting is direct and to the point. Parts of it are dark and hard to see - the showdown on the ship at night - but the fight scenes on the whole are very well done and realistic. A friend told me he saw parts of the Go-Ju form Sae Um Chun on it, I need to see it again to look for that. This is one of the early classics of its genre."
4,Brutal martial arts masterpiece,"This movie is a true classic in the martial arts genre. Sonny Chiba is a great fighter and his character is the baddest hero you could ever imagine. To give you a glimpse into his brutality, in one scene he sells a girl to the mafia because she couldn't pay him for rescuing her brother from prison. She is then drugged and raped! Over the top violence and excellent fight scenes are what make this movie one of the greatest fight flicks ever."
2,Action or Comedy Movie?,"Is this movie suppossed to be a martial arts movie or a comedy? The star (Sonny Chiba) seems as if he doesn't even know any martial arts, but is just faking it and the contortions of his face throughout the movie are ridiculous! I only gave it two stars as a comedy. Don't buy this movie unless you are looking for a comedic ""cult classic"" (read ""dud"")."
5,Beware,"DO NOT watch this movie on Netflix, I know this has nothing to do with buying this DVD here, but many people use amazon just to see reviews for a movie they will watch elsewhere. Netflix edited out every broken bone or shot of gore in this movie. I didnt even realize the movie was edited until a part of the ending skipped extremely far, I came online to watch the same scene and it turns out he actually ripped the dudes throat out. All I saw was his hand. There are way gorier movies than this on netflix, why they choose to butcher a movie for no apparrant reason I do not know. I was thinking how could Quentin Tarantino like this movie so much, it sucks. But the whole time was because netflix duped me. Just passing on the word to those who browse amazon and look at reviews for movies they are considering watching. If you watch it on netflix you will be dissapointed. I reccommend buying it here instead."
4,Good Action Packed Movie,I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to other customers. The movie brought back memories of the 70's action flicks.
2,OMG,It looked great but the sound is crappy. Wouldn't but another online until I could play same.Pay the money for a Yamaha.
4,A coming of age story,"When 14 year old Kirby, a young Navajo studying the ways of a Navajo ""singer"" (healer) takes his younger cousin Yazzie on a prarie dog hunt, the boys discover much about themselves. Through their discoveries they learn to respect the elders traditions and shun the white mans ways which are encroaching upon the reservation. But when Yazzie gets shot, Kirby must decide between the saving care of white mans medicine and the ancient ways of the reputatble Navajo singers. Kirby learns that he can be as tall as great standing rock (which reminds him of all his ancestors) if he makes the right decision."
4,My Baby Wants to be a Vet,"my child has always wanted to be a vet. this book is good for young children probably up to age 7 or 8. for older kids, the James herriot books might be good."
4,Such good value,"My daughter was/is interested in being a vet so we bought this, and for the price it is a deal and a half - simply order it. I thought it was a bit too basic, but again, it is for younger readers and there are fun images kids can enjoy. So I hesitate between a 4 and 5, but would not hesitate purchasing the book as it is very good values for a book under $5.00."
3,Insights for the Curious and the Converted,"For three hours every weekday afternoon, Al Kresta hosts a nationally syndicated talk show that addresses political, educational, cultural, and religious concerns. Questions about Catholic beliefs that have come up on the show are the focus of his new book, which he describes as ""a potpourri rather than a work of systematic theology."" His responses include quotations from scripture, Church documents, and writers ranging from Pliney the Younger to St. Padre Pio.Kresta, president and CEO of the Ave Maria Radio Network, has done graduate work in theology at both Catholic and Protestant seminaries. He brings that experience to bear with thought-provoking answers to more than 30 specific questions in five categories: teaching authority, salvation and sacraments; worship and devotion; hell; and the second coming. Certainly this is a good source of information for those outside the Church, but it also has much to offer practicing Catholics."
2,Was not as originally described,"The original ad said these deflectors would fit a Tacoma base 4 door EXTENDED cab, but the are made for a 4 door crew cab only.The front 2 fit perfect but I could NOT use the ones for the back."
2,Strike two,wrong vehicle....cannot use. product was sent back no replacement offered for my 1989 Ford Ranger. lost more moey on the deal.
2,front drive side vent shade,The drivers side front vent has a cut in it. I know it was used but did not say damage.
5,Great Product for the price.........,"Awesome ventshades. I have some inline LUND models on my 2007 Toyota Tacoma and these too look bad ass. As far as this product, it accenstuates my Super White Tacoma pretty nice. The black trim sticks out and what can I say, it was worth the purchase! Strongly recommend for anyone to buy these vent shades."
2,Not worthy of Austin Power's fame,"Honestly, I only bought this album for the fantastic song 'Beautiful Stranger' by Madonna. There were some other good songs- Green Day's 'Espionage' is memorable, but other than that, don't waste your money unless you're a true Madonna fan."
3,O.k.,"Well, since no one here has really given credit to the best song, I guess I will. The origional reason I borrowed this cd, and one of the two that I repeat listened to it, was ""Time of the Season."" When I saw Scott Weiland's name, I thought ""oh Lord,"" yet with that reaction I felt curiosity. Scott grooved along with Big Blue Missile. It's cool to see him doing something other than heroin (despite the fact that he's in jail now (again!)) The other reason is R.E.M. That song is a trip."
3,It sounded better in the theatre,"Its an OK CD, but I was expecting a lot. Really liked Madonna, but bought the CD for Green Day's Espionage. Word Up? what's up with that? American Woman - was this the version they used in the film? It was really noticable int he film, but here, I just skip over it now. FOr those of wondering about the short length (45 minutes), I expect we'll be seeing a ""More Austin Powers"" CD soon, containing music inspired by AP...."
4,"Yeah, baby, YEAH!","I absolutely loved this CD. All the songs but one are great. Lenny Kravitz does a kickin' version of that tired old song American Woman. Thank you, Lenny. I could listen to REM's version of ""Draggin' the Line"" over and over (and over...) it's so good. The only noticable flaw in an otherwise sparkling album, is some guys who call themselves ""Big Blue Missile"". Scott Weiland should know better. Did these guys even listen to the original before recording the dog's breakfast they call ""Time of the Season""? I think they could have used another couple of weeks practice. Anyway, the other tracks were solid, and it's always good to hear from Quincy Jones. A good CD to listen to while driving."
4,"good, not great","i thought the album was overall good but a couple of the songs arent that great...the best would have to be the lucy nation, green day, the who, and madonna...its worth buying if youre willing to skip over the few duds..."
3,Austin Powers 2 soundtrack deserves a average score.,"Overall, It is a ok CD. There is a few good tunes (madonna and rem), but other than that there isn't to much to be excited about. The Soul Bossa Nova is lively and funny. Only big Austin Powers fans or people who enjoyed the music in the movie should buy the CD."
5,"This Album Is Like A ""Time Machine""","This soundtrack has a nice blend of 90's-style beats and musical technology with the spirit of the 60's. Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"" has a nice sound. Lenny Kravitz' ""American Woman"" remix is well done, too. Many didn't like Melanie G's ""Word Up,"" but I thought it was fun, and of course Dr. Evil's take of ""Just The Two Of Us"" contains all the hilarity of the movie. ""Buggin'"" has an interesting sound, and the remake of ""Time Of The Season"" is different enough to seem new, but has a great sound. And I really enjoyed Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello's ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again."" All in all, this album has a light-hearted, enjoyable sound. I've had it for a day and listened to it four times already! So buy it and enjoy it is my advice."
4,Oh Behave baby!,I love Beautiful Stranger and My Generation. This is a pretty good CD but we could do without Scary Spice's Word Up. Good soundtrack for a hilarious movie!
2,Don't believe the hype,"Stop all the hype regarding Madonna- her song is weak. The album is solid but far from a ""must"" buy- some myopians will claim Madonna continues to rule but she is just a media machine. She has not had a good album or single in several years. She has bottomed out."
4,Buy it for the Madonna Track,By far the best track is Madonna's Beautiful Stranger. I will guarantee you will play the song 20 times and will hum it all day long the first day you buy it. Her best since the song Ray of Light..possibly better. The rest of the CD is ho-hum...REM's song is pretty good and a great live performance from the WHO
4,"Great Soundtrack, But One Stinker","This album is wonderful except for the totally awful track called ""Word Up"" by Melanie G (aka Scary Spice), believe me, scaaaaaary. The rest are the tracks are great and the mastering of this disc is top-notch. My personal favorite on this album is Elvis Costello's rendition of Burt Bacharach's ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again."" Beautiful."
5,Shagadelic Madonna!,"Madonna gets back ""Into The Groove"" with the groovy track, ""Beautiful Stranger"", her wonderful connection to the ""Austin Powers"" phenomenon. Is it any wonder the soundtrack is on her Maverick record label? Lots of '60's psychadelia with guitars and organs, plus Madonna's lush vocals top it off. Ms. Ciccone and co-writer/-producer Wiliam Orbit are still a match made in dance heaven. This song makes me wanna don tie-dye and peace beads, and love Madonna even more.Viva Ciccone!"
5,madonna song,"the madonna song is on uk radio at the moment and is amazing!! very her, very 60's but with a great 90's cross over club beat! im buying the album just for this track!"
2,Not as uninspired as the movie . . .,". . . but darn close. What a letdown, especially when compared to the first Austin Powers soundtrack. The pluses: Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger,"" REM's ""Draggin' the Line."" The minuses: Scott Weiland's godawful butchering of ""Time of the Season,"" Lenny Kravitz's lackluster ""American Woman,"" and Mel G's completely out-of-place hip-hop number ""Word Up"" (isn't this supposed to be a SIXTIES-inspired album?). Dr. Evil's ""Just the Two of Us"" is very funny in the movie, but pretty blah on disc.The album is also pretty skimpy at under 45 minutes. Why were so many songs in the movie left off the soundtrack (e.g., the ""Goldfinger""-inspired ""Dr. Evil"" theme)?Shame on all involved."
3,Madonna Outshines the Rest on this Soundtract,"Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"" starts off the ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" Soundtract with a bang, but much of the rest of the CD is a bit of a let down. The Song by Scary Spice is a joke.I think you should go out and buy this CD for Madonna's song (which is clearly the best on the tract), REM, The Who and Burt Bacharach. Dr. Evil's version of Will Smith's ""Just the Two of Us"" bring some comic relief while Lenny Kravitz ""American Women"" is a bit dull. This CD will definitly get you ""Groovin'"""
3,"Naff Film, Naff Fashions, One Great Song","Madonna's contribution is ho-hum. In 10 years, no-one will credit her trance/dance revival as anything other than a coda to her pop career. Lenny Kravitz is a phoney, so blow that one out of the way. The 'soundtrack' tunes are irritating bits of fluff - have done with them. 'Word Up' - oh dear. Which in essence leaves 'Buggin' - which is a fine slice of psych/pop, and REM's contribution, which is much more lively than almost anything they've done in the past five years. And then of course, the ONLY real reason to buy this slapdash piece of merchandise - The Who's 'Live at the BBC' version of 'My Generation'. If you pay less than 20 or dollars or whatever to hear this piece of history, you've got a bargain (maybe the best you've ever had)."
3,*Winners-Mel G Madonna Lenny Quincy Jones Green Day,"The top songs on this album are as follows: 1. American Woman 2. Word Up 3. Beautiful Stranger 4. Soul Bossa Nova 5. Espionage 6. Dr.Evil would be #1, but it doesn't really count The rest of the album, REM, the lucy nation, burt bacharach, the who etc isn't all that great. But overall it's a likable album, just make sure you keep the tracks on 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 12. Half good-album, half-bad. Worth a buy, though, I must say."
4,"Buy it if you only like the backround theam music,","I brought this CD at Chrismas 99 about the time wear Austn Powers was realsed,, There is a few classic's songs on it like Madona's hit Bueataful Stranger witch become quite popular outside he movieLenny Kravis's American Women- Despite what many know the song was realsed befor the movie was theaticly realsed witch made it popular........... After you lisen to it a few times your find yourself most likely lisening to those 2 songs mostly and maybe 1 or 2 other songs on there,,,,,and did I menchin that it has Dr.Evial's verisenof ""Just the two of us"" on it.....All in all if your only after the CD to get only like 1 or 2 songs on it go to like Kazza or WInMX and download theam off there dont waste your money on the CD"
2,"The movie is a lot better than the soundtrack, baby.","Keeping it short, Madonna's song was as good as it got on the soundtrack. The low being a lifeless and just plain terrible rendition of ""American Woman"". Let's just hope Lenny Kravitz doesn't ruin any more classics.The rest of the tracks are fair, but it's not good enough for me to recommend purchasing. If anything, buy the ""Beautiful Stranger"" single."
2,BAD BAD BAD!,"What a god-awful soundtrack! Folks who loved the International Man of Mystery CD will especially be dissapointed. Would it really have killed them to do the real songs instead of half-baked remakes by REM, Lenny Kravitz and others? Such songs as Draggin the Line and Time of the Season have never sounded worse--Time of the Season sounds like a machine. Even Soul Bossa Nova, Austin's theme, gets spectacularly garbled. And FYI--After you hear it once, DrEvil's rap is no longer funny. Save yourself the dough and buy the single of Beautiful Stranger, the one good song."
3,Where are the other songs?,"This soundtrack is really good, but it's a let down after the movie. The movie starts out with a ""Dr. Evil"" song, which is nowhere to be found on the soundtrack. When Austin comes back to the sixties, ""Magic Carpet Ride"" by Steppenwolf is playing in the background, but this excellent song is also excluded from the soundtrack. Although they played Lenny Kravitz's decent cover of ""American Woman"" during the credits, the Guess Who's version was used during the movie. Since it's the better version, it should be on the soundtrack. Finally, ""Let's Get it On,"" another good song in the movie, was also omitted from the soundtrack. The hillarious Dr. Evil version of ""Just the Two of Us"" makes up slightly for this, but overall, I was fairly angry with this cd's content."
4,Groovy baby!,"Austin Powers soundtrack is awesome thanks to that catchy Madonna song, Beautiful Stranger - loved the video as well. Time of the Season by Scott Weiland is my second favorite track here. American Woman by Lenny Kravitz is ok but I like the original better. Word Up by Scary Spice is beyond horrible, yikes! If you are a Madonna fan then you have to pick up this cd, enjoy!"
3,Whey Hey,American Woman is one of the reasons that i would buy this CD. Its such a funky tune and sets the mood for partof the movie. Does anyone know if there is a single of it? Mads shines in this too. There is a song for everyone. Shame 'bout the movie!
3,Spanish Harlen,"Aretha is great for cover songs, which is a song made famous by someone else. We all know Ben E. King's verson of Spanish Harlem but she puts her own special character into the song; however, she should have left Gentle on My Mind alone. In any case, there are at least three great songs and her picture should be worth the five bucks. It would cost that much at Walmart if it were in stock. Thanks! HC"
4,great size,just picked this up used for a very low price. It is the perfect size and has many entries. I recommend it for the casual user.
4,"Incredible, thick, beautiful vocals!!","I discovered Ginger and Sarah by browsing through MP3.com, then ordered the CD from Amazon...Just beautiful. The songs are masterfully crafted, the production is simple but complete, and their voices are better than anything I've ever heard. I can't tell you how much I love it--haven't taken it out of my stereo since May!!"
2,not as pictured,"The model 94443 may be a good product, but it doesn't fit a 2009 Ford 150 as pictured."
5,The kids ask to watch this one!,We bought this as a Chirstmas present for our 4 and 6 yr. olds and they love it. It has really helped them feel more confident in their drawing and creativity. They have been able to apply many of the concepts presented to their own art work. I would recommend this to any parent.
4,"Squiggles, Dots & Lines","Very good video for teaching very basic drawing skills, (perfect for very young grades).Commercial before the video begins is too long and needs to be fast forwarded if this video is shown in a classroom."
2,not all that,"I'm mystified by the positive reviews here. I borrowed this at the library, and I'm glad I am glad I didn't pay $10 for it. The fact that it was 1980s and bad child acting with bad music did not really bother my child, because he does not watch any TV so any video is a treat, but 80% of the video is introduction and fluff and the substance (the alphabet of drawing) when they finally get to it, is rushed. It would have been better to develop the alphabet over a few lessons with lots of examples, but that might have taken more than 20 minutes. Clearly the video was made back when video production was still expensive and they obviously had a very tight budget. Doubtless there are hours of better instruction online now, some appropriate for kids, and I aim to find some of it. Bottom line: library item as long as you don't have high expectations."
1,not worth the money,"common sense stuff, pharacuetical approach, anything of note is available on the internet. quite a few times he negates the use of herbs and any sort of alternative healing for lack of controlled studies with proof positive. yet, he accepts antidotal evidence for the efficacy of vicks vapor rub to cure toe fungus and a bar of soap to prevent leg pain/cramps at night. go figure!a book i do recommend on personal health care at any age is Linda Page's Healthy Healing."
5,A straightforward primer for all-around better health,"In Live Longer, Live Better: Taking Care Of Your Health After 50, popular medical columnist and physician Peter H. Gott, offers the non-specialist general reader a straightforward primer for all-around better health. Chapters address a wide range of common health concerns such as hypertension, anxiety and depression, sex, diabetes, stroke, cholesterol, osteoporosis, memory loss, senility and dementia, and much more. Presented in a simple question-and-answer format, Live Longer, Live Better is recommended reading; the health advice is quite pertinent to all ages, and in today's era of skyrocketing health care insurance prices, an ounce of prevention is worth much more than a pound of cure."
5,practical reading,I read Dr Gott's newspaper column all the time. The book is written in a similar manner. The advice is told in laymans terms and as a result is practical and easy to understand.
3,Not a good beginner guitar,"Got this for a 10 year old to begin playing guitar. The accessories included are a good bonus. This guitar looks nice, but is hard to play. The overall size is good, but the neck is wide and the stings are set too far out. It is difficult to get your fingers all the way around and then to push so hard on the strings to produce the notes. Your fingers get sore quickly and it is frustrating to the beginner. If you can learn to play on this guitar, you can play anything!"
4,Haunting,"A most compelling read for a collection of Werewolf tales. Ranging from the common, to the not so common time traveling Lyncanthrop, this collection holds a wide gambit of tales all published in 1991. However, the real gem of the books shines forth at the end when a brief filmography is given for Werewolf movies"
1,Can't even read it...,"I don't know if this book was any good or not. WHY CAN'T I CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE FONT? Whoever set up the Kindle edition needs to be horsewhipped, and I'll supply the horse. It was completely illegible. It had very thin, very small, white font on a black background. I even bought magnifying glasses hoping that would help, but sadly I still couldn't read it. I should get my money back and whoever set it up like this should personally apologize for the poor quality."
4,Workout to this all day long,"I like this album, I've only heard the clean version, and it keeps a rocking beat. I've been working out to it and I love it. His guest artists are awesome and the raps are tight and I'm not a big rap fan. It's a perfect blend of neo-soul, rap and all the other genres Diddy has been working in. I'm impressed."
3,The Ultimate Wine Cookbook,". . . More than a cook book, here is a complete guide to the use of wine, both as seasoning and as a beverage. Contains more than 300 tested basic recipes, most of them permitting any number of variations. Soups, salads and sauces, fish, meats, poultry and game -- each has its separate chapter, and in each recipe wine is an important ingredient."
5,Great movie.,I saw part of this movie on Tv and wanted to see the whole movie.I am a sci-fi fan and for me this was a great movie to watch.
2,Bad But Watchable,"""American Warships"" is a direct attempt to capitalize on the release ofBattleship (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet), but falls very short in most regards.No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows the crew of USS Iowa (Captained by Mario Van Peebles) as it heads to be decommissioned, but strange events and unprovoked attacks by a powerful enemy interrupt the retirement plans. This is slightly better acted than most Asylum films, but the special effects were weak all the way through and the editing was often disjointed, with distracting continuity errors all the way through.This is a low budget Sci-Fi that I will not likely seek out to watch again.CFH"
2,Poor Realism,"The movie ""American Warships"" is okay, but they could do alot better if they take there time and work on the realism parts. The aliens didnt look that great, those big 16"" gun turrets turn way too fast. You will also noticed there some reruns on those 5"" guns at closeup, and of course it was computer graphics. I wouldnt pay much for this video, glad i spend 3.99 to watch it instead of buying the dvd for twelve bucks.Now i dont know if they copy from Battleship 2012, or they did. Battleship 2012 was pretty darn good movie and worth 19.99 on dvd if you want it. So i voted 2 out of 5 stars for ""American Warships""."
3,American Warships,Amazon Instant Video is a great way to shop but some movies are just not worth it and Warships is one of those. If you want to see a naval movie in this catagory Battleship was the movie to watch; Warships is a poor second.
1,never worked,never down loaded so i did not see the movie your a ripoff my experience was terriable no costomer service !
1,Not even an IOWA class battleship,This is bad; they can't even use a model of an IOWA class ship for their rip-off movie. With round portholes on the bridge and quad 40mms in their tubs this movie uses a WWII battleship like the North Carolina or Alabama as a stand-in for the IOWA. EMBARRASSING! Cheap CG completes this disaster of an excuse for a movie. Can I give it ZERO stars?
1,Another miserable Asylum production,"It amazes me that The Asylum still puts out the bad movies they do. You would think that by now, they would at least TRY once or twice a year. If you're gonna make a knock off of a big budget movie, maybe you get a real FX team once in a while. This time out they decided to rip off Battleship and not only is THIS movie bad from start to finish, it's rather insulting to anyone who ever served on the USS Iowa! The aliens in this were ridiculous as were their attempt at FX --- and Mario Van Peeples was totally wasted in it. The rest of the cast though, were attrocious! Thank goodness I saw this for free on Syfy Channel, because even renting this turkey would be a waste of good money! As for everyone saying this was better than Battleship, perhaps they need to go see Battleship again. Whereas Battleship was action packed and IMO quite entertaining, American Warships was just terrible!"
5,A book to fall in love with,"This is one of the books my 6 year old and I read for her recent reading assignment at school. It is very difficult not to love this book! Isabelle is such a simple, sweet and endearing little pig! Her love of going to the museum daily, sitting in a big red chair and watching a painting is such a lovely image. The illustrations are just wonderful and the book, itself, with this sweet simple little story is very easy 'to get lost in'. This is what we call 'a SPECIAL book' in our house!"
2,One of the worst canes I've owned,"I bought this cane to replace a white NFB telescoping cane in the hopes that it would be far more durable. I'm disappointed in how quickly this cane is wearing down in just a few months. The elastic cord is already starting to fray, and the joints stick easily. The golf-grip-style handle is also very low-quality. I've had a cane of this style once that lasted over two years, and I doubt this one will last six months."
5,"Forget about Mast-r-lift, get this table and a Milwaukee 5625-20",These JessEm products are superb quality with fantastic design. I don't know why more people haven't picked up on the Milwaukee 5625-20 3 hp router. It is a beautiful machine with a depth adjustment that can be accessed thru a hole in the router table (from above). When paired with this table and the universal plate you have all the features of the elaborate add on lift mechanisms at a fraction of the combined price.
3,Swing needs work to make it safe.,"If you look at the hook for this it has a quite wide spacing, which allows the swing to slide off off the top of the cage and let your little bird plummet. Fix this by bending the wire close together so it won't slip."
2,Boring!!!,"I don't know, I just found this book to be incredibly dull, and the ending weak. Maybe the writer was trying to create an Agatha Christie feel but, at least in my view, he failed miserably. One good thing was that I checked the book out of the library, so I did not waste anything other than time."
2,Audiophiles beware,"Just downloaded this in lossless format, and I can hear numerous people coughing and a chair seat cushion banging up against the back from someone abruptly getting up. Such beautiful music to be wasted on a hacking audience."
4,Religion and Sadism meet on a far away planet.,Protaganist travels to a back water planet and finds a world of misery run by an overlord of pain. Really a tale of mans acceptance of degredation as long as the gun isn't pointed his way. That being said the book is fun in a space opera way with the hero trying his best to save the populace from themselves. Good stuff
4,"Ah, the bitch fights from heaven","This is pure comic genius, which depresses me because WB has cancelled this and all other shows I've gotten into, yet has kept 7th heaven for...well, all I know is that really young kid is finally having premarital sex. Dear god, anyways I recommend everyone who is an early-90's television fan to buy this dvd. While the show is great, the packaging sucks. I am not kidding. The dvd holsters are so bad that they sometimes let go of the dvds that are inside. Also, the picture quality isn't great, especially for the $50 I forked over for it. But all in all, it is still worth buying because, like so many of my other favorite tv shows, you can watch it over and over again. And get other friends addicted. I just can't wait till they release the second season."
4,Funny,"I watched practically the whole first season though unfortunately missed the last two episodes (season finale) which I was disappointed about. Popular is entertaining and funny at the same time, dealing with issues that kids deal with in the west in an entertaining way. I liked the fact that it isn't so ""formal"", it has a nice creative style to it."
3,Pretty good.,"This product came in its original packaging,but the only thing I disliked was that the disc were loose in the box when it was packaged and didnt say in the case well. Other than that, good quality."
5,POPULAR is..... POPULAR!!!!!,"EVERYONE here that has wrote a review has said everything anyone can say about such a GREAT WONDERFUL SOOOOOOOOO UNDER-RATED SHOW!THE ONE LINERS!!!! THE TEAR JERK STORIES!!! THE COMEDIC ACTS THE GIRLS DID!!! THE LIST IS ENDLESS! QUOTE: SAM!, MICHAEL JACKSON CALLED! HE WANTS HIS EYE BROWS BACK!!!! LOLOLOLOLOLCOME ON! IT DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS! THE WHOLE CAST ROCKS. AND FOR ANYONE THAT DOESNT WATCH THE HILARIOUS TV SHOW 'WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU' [AMANDA BYNES / JEANIE GARTH] OUR FAVE GAL PAL 'MARY CHERRY' IS ON IT AS A REGULAR. AND SHE EVEN DOES 'MARY CHERRY' THINGS AS IF SHE'S HER! SO FUNNY!CHEERS AND PEACE TO ALL!CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SEPT. 2004!!!! YEAHHHH BABY!!WOOO HOOOO!GLENN / USA / SO FLORIDA"
5,Dude,Dude I loved this show... why did it have to go off the air?? This DVD is totally worth buying!!
3,Where has all the beautiful music gone!,"Don't get me wrong...Popular is by far my favorite show of all time. I practically jumped out of my chair when I saw that it had come out on DVD. My one complaint about this particular DVD set, and it's a big one, is that they have taken out several of the songs in many of what I found to be defining moments of the show and replaced them with bland and unoriginal tracks. Many of my fond memories of the show came from the songs they originally chose. I will without a doubt purchase the second season, but I'm not looking forward to the musical changes it will inevitably contain. The change in song is enough to drop this DVD set down to a 3 for me. Does anyone know why they do this to shows when they are released on DVD? I've noticed this exact same thing happening on other tv show DVD sets."
5,"GERMAN RELEASE, PLEASE!!!","This show was soooooo great. But the ending (we never will know what happened to Brooke in the end) was to short. In Germany the show was sucessful, too. Please, Buena Vista Home Entertaiment, give other countries (especially Germany in this case :-) ) a DVD Release. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!"
5,One dream comes true..,"I've been hoping ever since they ended the show that they'd put in on DVD! This was my favorite show when it was on. Actually, it's the only show on the WB network that I ever actually watched. I'm not too into trendy shows, but I was obsessed with Popular, and if I missed it one week I would freak. The cliffhanger really killed my spirit. I want to know what happened! The price is a bit steep... but I might just have to put out the money for this, especially if it helps the chances of season 2 being released on dvd! I am in heaven knowing that it's actually being released and I'm actually still young enough to appreciate it! LOL"
4,excellent with a minor drawback,"i have watched the first couple of episodes on the 1st season dvd. i have been impressed with the story lines and lack of the usual emptiness of high school shows. so for all that i am grateful. but...as i watch this show i have to be honest - this girl playing sam is just incredibly attractive. so its hard for me to believe this girl is unpopular when everytime she comes on screen the thought literally runs through my head -""good grief she is hot."" and personally i find carly pope(sam) 100 times better looking than leslie bibb(brooke). but aside from this the show is well done. which is why it doesnt surprise me that it was cancelled. i think there is a rule that only one good show is allowed on tv at a time. so that people will not get destracted from the bloated and diseased crap they call reality television..."
4,Excellent Picture Quality ... But,The unit works as advertized but the picture goes out of sync and the picture goes dark on my TV for few seconds and has to re-sync.I have a Sharp TV connected to Yamaha RX-V663 AV Receiver...This seems to be happening more when i watch TV (from the Motorola PVR) than when I use XBOX 360 or BluRay player... I can't seem to figure out the exact reason as to what is happening. I am going to contact the vendor support to see if they can shead any light on this issue.other wise great product.h
4,wild ride!,"Charlie Stross was clearly having fun, and when an author has fun writing a book the reader can't help buf follow through (although I did find myself wishing that Imperial Russia wasn't quite as proficient in being a posterchild for boneheadedness and buffoonery - it seems to be used by so many writers to personify these traits...) Michael Swanwick, in his blurb review, called the book a ""joyous romp"" and that's precisely what it is, with a serious edge to it, too. I enjoyed, much, even though I rarely read the cutting-edge hard SF books any more these days. But I do recommend this one for the sheer entertainment value... and a couple of sharp psychological insights thrown in to spice the mix."
3,"""I like starships. I -- I'm not so good with people.""","Great story - along the lines of Vernor Vinge - that followed a nice arc in the relationship between the two counter-agents, Rachel and Martin, as they get incredibly tangled up in the mess of a isolationist grouping of planets who are on the verge of mass exposure to technology and unfettered information. The ""tech speak"" runs a bit heavy at time and some of the segments which observe actions on the flight decks are just dripping with clever tech speak - so much so, that these passages reminded me of Jules Verne's tedious descriptions of each bolt and weld in ""20,000 Leagues"". I tended to float gently over the tech manual sections and then land firmly in the paragraphs that got back to the story."
4,Thoughtfully and artfully crafted sci-fi,"Stross weaves a tale of ""post singularity"" technology that draws the reader in right from the first chapter. The best way to decide on this book is to download the first chapter on a Kindle and read it. You'll love the book if you love the first chapter, it's not a book that wanders off, it has a satisfying ending and all the middle bits are just as engaging as the opening."
5,Excellent example of a blend of high tech and space opera!,"In my opinion, this book has it all, because it takes place hundreds of years in our future where technology has allowed humanity to travel faster-than-light in order to scatter himself amongst the stars, but it is also great sci-fi space opera and belongs with: ""Foundation"", ""Ringworld"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Childhood's End"", ""2001"", 2010"", ""Advent of the Corps"", and many others. Great read!"
4,Slightly Overrated,"Which means it deserves a 3.5, but I'm feeling merciful...Began well (great opening line) but pretty quickly lost momentum and novelty. Stross may be good at writing action but not so good at characterization or plot pacing. There were some novel ideas in the book, but they were mostly in the background (like the idea of the Eschaton) and never fully explored, and the foreground plot was less compelling.Plus, as others have pointed out, the book had too much of a contemporary feel to it, and then there was the horrid bit with the mimes...shudder...Not sure why this is nominated for a Hugo - if you want far better-written and original space opera, or just a plain good read, try Alastair Reynolds or John Wright,"
1,Stross strikes out...again,"Charles Stross. One of the main authors in the hard sci-fi genre. Felt it I should check him out. Unfortunately, unlike Alastair Reynolds or Iain Banks, Stross seems to utterly lack the ability to make you care about the people in his books. Read about half-way through and just realized ""I don't care how this ends..."" and put it down."
2,Some authors should stick with short stories...,"While his wordplay, setting and concepts are (as usual) nothing short of breath-taking his characters and plot developement are nothing short of yawn inducing.Stross joins the quickly swelling ranks of hard sci-fi authors whose brilliant short stories seem to hint at limitless potential and yet when they step out of the briefer medium immediatly stumble in novel form and eventually fall flat on their face(s).Stross's future bending content and stunning technopoetry-prose shimmer with a level of craftsmenship severly lacking in his novel's characters and plot growth. And until Stross devotes the that same stylized proficency to his basic story elements he should avoid novels and stick with a format where such absences can be overlooked- shorts.Stross has all all of the style and none of the content required to weave the epic stories he's trying to pen."
3,"Good, but might have been better as a short story.","This book felt rather like a short story padded out (mostly with irrelevant space opera scenes) to novel-length. I found parts of it quite thought-provoking, though, particularly the question of what happens to a society in which everyone is suddenly given everything they ask for.I love the way the prologue is written--it grabs you with its clever ideas and high speed--made me wish the whole story was written that way instead of bogging down in tiresome military drama, clunky romance scenes, etc...Not really a book to buy--I'd recommend getting this one from the library and reading it quickly, skimming through the filler."
4,Hell of a book,"This guy is a truly awesome writer! It hi first book and the end id a little drawn out, but a good sign of things to come. . ."
3,Lovely thing this Eschaton!,"I enjoyed the Eschaton thing. Sentences like ""I am not your god,"" followed by behaviour that indicates that it might very well be for all practical purposes - is just hilarious.And there is plenty of good Space Opera in this book.That said I were a bit bored from time to time, I am afraid to say. Therefore it can't be more than 3 stars.-Simon"
2,What's the point?,"Stross writes with confidence and in fine style, but I was still left feeling empty. The problem with writing about technological singularity is that it's like trying to describe the Internet to an ant. Too far outside the frame of reference of even the author.I enjoy novels where I feel something for the characters, whether it be affection, love or even loathing. These characters left me indifferent.Having said all that, Stross has an eye for irony that gave me a few chuckles."
4,"A bit rough edged, but good","I've been reading Charles Stross's ""Accellerando"" cycle of short stories in Asimov and have been much impressed. As such, I've been looking forward to reading Singularity Sky.This is a first novel and much be judged accordingly. It does have its rough edges. Like many hard SF authors, Stross has a love of technical jargon that does, sometimes, get in the way of the story. I must also note that I found the ending to be less than satisfactory and something of a cheat given the events of the story.That said, the book is brimming with fresh ideas. Stross appears to be one of the few authors who takes the notion of a Vingean Singularity seriously and that comes through in this story to its benefit. He's also better at characterization than most hard SF authors manage (which isn't to say that it couldn't stand some improvement).It is a book filled with ideas and brimming with a sense of wonder. I don't doubt that as he hones his skills, he will be an author to reckon with."
2,overload,"Simply put, I had serious problems with this book. Firstly, the characters seemed one dimensional and lacking defining characteristics that make them individuals. Stross' main flaw, however, is the amount of information that that he feels is pertinent for the reader to understand. I am an avid science fiction fan but instead of reading every word about an interesting piece of equipment or a weird mutation on Rochald's World I consciously skipped over the lengthy sentences that spew quite incoherently, trails of techno-babble. The story does have some strength in its ideas. For example, the festival's interaction with societies is extremely interesting and a little more focus would have greatly improved the novel.2/5 execution, 1/5 focus, 5/5 ideas = 2/5 overall"
3,choppy,"This book was fairly good. It delves into some great hard science (specifically FTL and its casual effects on time) however it meanders through some cold war soviet political crap that is mind-numbing. The author also strives to make the space battles as realistic as possible. Usually this would be a good thing, however in this case the author puits all his energy into getting the naval jargon correct instead of actually explaining/describing what is going on to the reader. It was confusing at times. The author obviously has a solid understanding of physics but he lacks in ability to explain it to the reader and the reader is left to simply accept it or get boggled down in the sparce explanation. This author could learn a thing or two about explaining physics to a layman from Steven Baxter. All in all, it has some excellent elements that lend itself to sequels."
3,Follow the fate of an idealistic saboteur,"Similar to Richard K Morgan's ""Thirteen"", I liked the story; but, did not enjoy getting an ear full of political rhetoric with every chapter. I am not a member of the Esoteric Society of Stross - although, I am sure they are out there (don't want to hurt anybody's feelings). Will say that I'm looking forward to the upcoming release of Stross' new Laundry Files Novel, The Fuller Memorandum. Hopefully, Cthulhu doesn't have a political agenda."
3,Two Stories Converged in a Wood...,"Singularity Sky has two big ideas at play. The first is the practical ramifications of the singularity on a culture not that far removed from our own. The second is a believable approach to time travel as applied to interplanetary warfare. Unfortunately, the mind-blowing connotations produced by the first are overshadowed by the melodrama of the second. Charles Stross has always packed more ideas per chapter than most science fiction writers articulate in the entire book. That is usually a good thing. Here, however, the two sides were less peanut butter and chocolate than they were peanut butter and pickles; potential compelling narratives on their own but unsatisfying when munged together."
4,Good read,"While not the bext work of science fiction to hit the shelves, Singularity Sky does provide a couple of hours of good, soldin entertainment and intrigue for the less demanding Sci-Fi reader. It is one of the books that you buy when boarding a plane, are done with half way through the flight, and re-read it again when you get bored with the in-flight entertainment.Worth the money, not stunning though."
3,It's Okay.,"Had to watch this film for class. I think the idea of the film's production itself was a success, but the story and certain elements were contradicting and didn't make sense. I think the acting was good overall. It's just not my kind of movie."
4,Good of its kind,"pretty good organ CD- but not good enough to need 2 copies.I was having trouble with on line ordering. It is not easy to add a second item to the first ordered and have it stay correct- or even to correct the order. So i ended up with 2 ""Funky Organ""!I attempted to delete and re order but was shipped and billed for 2 ""Funky organ""! Now I am beyond 30 day for return!Bill Heid has one of the best numbers on the CD.Joey D does well with the Preacher- possibly an older cut that has something to it other than his recent overdone notes stylings. Besides putting on weight I think he is getting bored and just piles on a lot of notes rather than getting emotionally involved in his playing."
1,"moderately decent game, horribly inconvenient","Play at Joe's Sudoku is a moderately decent version of Sudoku, not half as nice as the shareware version I had downloaded. I bought this version because I wanted a CD, rather than paying for a software key that could get lost. Boy did I miss the point! This game REQUIRES the CD to start. Who does it that way today and why? I like to play games like this while I'm busy with other tasks, like burning copies of home movies for relatives. Unless I remember to start the game first, I'm out of luck. And I've got to keep that CD on my desk, available in case I want to play it. In other words, I DON'T play it, I'm back to playing Solitare. I spent $20 on a totally worthless game."
3,Three classics +,"This is a disc I picked up years back pretty much for just a few songs. Obviously ""Rapper's Delight"" is here, though it's chopped up on both ends. But the other must-haves are ""The Message"", and the breakdancing classic ""Jam On It"". I love that track. The rest is still good of course, just wasn't well known to me. No doubt there's better collections like this around (try ""best of Sugarhill Records""), but for the price, go for it."
5,PERFECT PRODUCT /PERFECT PRICE,"PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED,WORKS PERFECT - I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR AWHILE, THE PRICE IS PERFECT & IT ARRIVED PRETTY FAST."
5,It's a children's book for an adult audience!,"Having grown up in Scandinavia this was one of the first books I ever read, and I have read it many times since. It is a poetic wonderfully bizarre book, and when you read it along with the rest of Tove Jansson's books you realize that her magical world of mumins isn't really all that different from the one we live in. Best of all, Tove Jansson opens a window to the reader's soul in her writing, and you recognize yourself in her books."
3,Incoherent compilation,"Don't get me wrong...there are some great tracks on here. Such as 'Tapioca Tundra', 'Pleasant Valley Sunday', 'Oh My My', 'It's Nice To Be With You', the title track and 'Words'. It's basically a budget priced compilation with 9 tracks that every Monkees fan worth their salt already has at least once. With the exception of 'You Can't Tie A Mustang Down', the sole previously unissued recording. It's sung by Davy, circa '66- '67 (I'm guessing), and completely worthless as a song. However- and here's the catch- it's not available on any other release to date, making this (sigh) a necessary purchase for Monkeemaniacs. Oh well... let's hear 'Valleri' one more time..."
4,Frozen pudding-- at last,"With the inclusion of ""Tapioca Tundra,"" FLASHBACK's DAYDREAM BELIEVER And Other Hits corrects an error common to most previous single-disc ""Best Of"" MONKEES compilations. The consistently overlooked ""Tundra"" reached #34 on the BILLBOARD charts in 1968, and is one of Mike Nesmith's best contributions to the Monkees canon.DAYDREAM BELIEVER (etc.) contains singles released between 1967 and 1970, including their last bottom-charting song, ""Oh My My,"" recorded when only two Monkees remained (Jones and Dolenz). Additionally, the Don Kirshner produced ""You Can't Tie A Mustang Down"" is given first light on this collection. Featuring a closely-miked Davy Jones, this 1967 curio was possible 'B' side material.Transfer quality is excellent. Written brief commentary on all songs.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 28:35"
4,painting more animals on rocks,painting more animals on rocks is just what I needed for ideas of more things to put on rocks. I am sure it will help me further my interest in painting on rocks. My yard is going to be full of my creations. I will also share my book with the group at my senior center.
5,Looking for Fun??,"This book has so many ideas for a craft person. The instructions are very easy and the rocks are fun to make. My 5 year old grandson found it easy too. He made a Lady Bug. This book is worth having if you are loooking for a project that doesn't cost much money, and is really fun to do. You can take the whole family out on a hike looking for rocks, this was a nice outing too. Have fun and enjoy."
1,Not what we thought it was,"We thought that this was the DVD of the Rubicon TV show but it was not, so it was nothing that we wanted."
2,"Good, but could be better","In many ways, this book is better than the first; however, there are so many editing errors in this book that it is annoying to read. For example, using the word to instead of too, or now instead of know. I can only guess that they rushed to publish this book without having a technical writer review the book. A spellcheck program doesn't help with the errors this book contains."
2,A fascinating letdown,"It's difficult to criticize this well intentioned picaresque story of horror, but in the end, it simply meanders from one disaster to another. It's very sad, well told and ""important"". But two-thirds of the way through, I had had enough."
1,WHAT is the POINT?,"Not that I don't sympathize with the subject matter but this book is long, tedious, full of profanity,and extremely embellished. It made me want to die. Do not read it. Find something else on the subject. Might I suggest watching ""God Grew Tired of Us""? You'll get the point without contemplating death and it is a wonderful film all about the Lost Boys."
5,An excellent work of literature and journalism,"This book is simultaneously a very well written work of fiction and a moving work of journalism. Eggers' writing style is powerful and simple, and the plot of this novel is a moving of a story of a man's coming of age. But in addition to being an excellent novel, What is the What vividly describes what it is like to grow up and live in war-torn, modern-day Sudan. Eggers does an excellent job of explaining the causes of the war and its consequences through the voices of his characters. This book leaves the reader with a better understanding of the conflict in Sudan, the innumerable hardships faced by those affected by war, and the struggle of those who come to America carrying everything they own. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"
3,Decent,"The books was reasonably interesting, but after a while the parts describing desolate treks from one hoped-for safe haven to another feel like they no longer add that much to the story. Cutting between the present day and Sudan does help with this. Reading about how the refugee camps were set up was interesting, as was getting a perspective into daily life there."
5,Wow! Beautifully Written!,"Wow! is all I can say about What Is The What. This book is so detailed and beautifully written it will keep u intrigued, guessing, and turning pages until you finish to the end. Even when the book ended I was up on the web page of Mr. Deng because I wanted and needed to know what is the what about him. The book is almost 500 pages and you wouldn't even notice because as soon as you pick it up and begin you will transform into the journey of what Mr. Deng went thru and came out. Beautifully written, and I loved how history was intertwined thru the pages as well as the humor. I think I have learned alot from this book and I wish Mr. Valentino Deng the best! Thanks for surviving and telling your story and Thanx to the author for writing this story and letting the world know about the lost boys!"
5,great evil and what it does to people,"we live in a beautiful world where some great evil also live.and if you like to know about people who are the victims of that evil, you'd like to read about this people, hear what they say, what they're going through, what their culture is. you really would want a good story, a story that will not dramatize everything excessively.truth and facts. a sincere voice.this book made me realize a different reality which is quite different from my own.because of that, l strongly recommend this book to you, which is a pleasure to read."
1,Haven't read it yet,Hard to get into. Selected for our Winter Texan book club next fall so no rush. Looks like it is going to be a hard read for me.
3,"Pretty standard, physically","Overall, this is a pretty standard paperback. I don't have any specific complaints about it, really. The cover's color scheme is pretty nice, and the imagery is fitting. I'm not a big fan of the glossy and slippery main graphic on the front, but it's not too distracting. At least it's not raised.I could have done without the permanent faux-sticker telling me about all the great awards it has won.The spine is really good, though, refusing to crease even after extensive readings."
1,Awful.,"This could've been an interesting story; instead, Eggers draws it out to the point where the reader gets exasperated. I won't finish it. This is an author in love with the sound of his own words, BADLY in need of a good editor."
3,not bad just too long,"Was too long, the story dragged a bit. But a good story & very easy writing.Did not learn a lot about the conflict, but did get a good insight into the life of a refugee, both in camps & in host countries."
4,Eye-opening book.,"This heartbreaking work is both easy to read, and hard to read. Easy, because Eggers is a very gifted writer, and hard, because the story of the Lost Boys is horrifying. Reading about hardship upon hardship almost became tedious, but the author balanced this by moving back and forth between the protagonist's history, and his current life in the U.S. I can't really say I liked this book, but I feel like it was important to read it, and important to get others to read it. Like many others, I was UNAWARE. If you want to wake up your social conscious, read this book."
1,The Award for the WORST Book Chosen by a Book Club Goes to....,"The only appeal to this book is that it appears to be ""politically correct"" to not only read it, but give it a review that exceeds the quality of the story and writing. Just because a book is about a powerful subject doesn't mean it is well written.My book club has been reading and selecting books for over 15 years, and this has to be the absolute WORST book ever! Simple sentence structure combined with an erratic story is only worthy of 1* in my book club. Don't waste your time!By the way, just because millions of people bought this book, doesn't mean it's great. If that was the case, there would be more than 200 some positive reviews here. Think about it. All those people have thrown it away...donated to Goodwill...passed it on to someone they don't like, otherwise there would be thousands upon thousands of positive reviews here."
5,Amazing,"Eggers may be the best writer I've read, and this is his finest work. Simply an amazing story."
4,Buy this book!,"An excellent book, well presented and refreshingly topical. The details of a harrowing life do not leave the reader cold... Instead there is a valuable warmth to the volume- we feel at ease with Eggers' easy dialogue and in turn with the tour de force of humanity that is Valentino Achak Deng. Sudanese strife- once a formidable topic- is made surmountable. One asks, 'WHAT CAN I DO FOR SUDAN?' However, fans of Eggers may be dissappointed at the lack of literary innovation but this book remains more important than that... It addresses a problem we have for so long ignored, and it does this brilliantly... A triumph."
2,"Greatidea, poor novel","I so badly wanted to like this novel about the ""lost boys"" of Sudan. This novel had no rhythm, though. It seemed that the author used this novel as an opportunity to inform. So many conversations were just excuses to provide more background material. A great author can do this successfully, but that did not happen here. Sad to say, this book lost my interest early on, and never regained it. If this topic interests you, there's a lot you will like here. Maybe this novel will engage and move you, but it didn't do it for me. The ""lost boys"" magazine articles I had read before were much better than this novel."
1,only 1 recipe!,"I am NOT much of a cook, but am trying to learn with my young kids (ages 6 & 7) by my side. I bought this DVD in hopes that we would get some good general cooking information. We got ONE recipe (muffin tin eggs - not exactly something we will do often!), along with a LOT of ""filler"" - lame jokes and so on. I guess I had assumed we be watching them scramble, fry, hardboil, make an omelette, prep an egg casserole, get ideas for additions (cheese, ham, bell peppers, etc.). I thought they would discuss when you use a frypan vs. the oven vs. a pot, whisk vs. spoon, spatulas, etc. My kids don't watch much TV, so they are usually thrilled to watch anything offered, but even they didn't want to see this again. I can't blame them - neither did I. So I'm still on the hunt for a good cooking DVD for kids covering equipment, techniques, ingredients, etc."
2,Not for MS kids,"I asked my MS student to check out this video and give me a review. Before she even said anything I knew she didn't like what she was looking at. Her response to ""Are you enjoying the DVD?"" was ""It's for kids!."""
3,Not as good as Place in the Sun,"I loved A Place in the sun, so I eagerly awaited this CD. However, I was pretty disappointed with Tripping the Light Fantastic. This is much more hardcore than Place in the Sun. DO NOT buy this if you want more catchy riffs and harmonic vocals. This is not to say there are not good songs on it. While there are no ultra-catchy songs like My Own Worst Enemy, Bitter and Fuel are good, along with the earlier No Big Thing. Other than them, I had a hard time getting into the CD and listening to it beginning-to-end. It is easy to see that they matured significantly. So, in summary, if you are a casual fan, this CD is probably not for you, but if you are a diehard Lit fan, get it."
5,It's About Time!,"I am a friend and former band mate to Lit's Lead guitarist Jeremy. If the world had any true idea what it's like trying to make it big and the dues that must be paid. Everyone would buy this CD. From ""Charlet Pink"" to ""Straight Lace"" and from ""Dreams"" to ""Razzle"". These guys especially Jeremy and A.J. have really paid the dues. This album, like the last is great. I wish the world knew how much work and effort these guys put in too making great music and pleasing their fans. Lit is a great band full of great guys and you will not be let down in the least if you order this CD. NOTE: To Jeremy and A.J. Congrats on all the success guys. You really deserve it. Not bad at all for some Orange County Schleps like us. I guess dreams do come true."
5,Great cd for what it's worth,This cd is basicall what every teenager feels. I like the loudness. It has the catching tunes as well as inner song meanings.
2,yep it sure does suck,this cd is terrrible. it doesn't have much rythym and it's my least favorite cd. Their newest one is very very cool though buy that one instead. Completely diferent from their first album. Atomic is gonna be great too.
2,Disappointing,"This is a very poor album compared to Place in the Sun. the ""heavy"" attitude does not work and nearly the songs are simply filler. Do yourself a favour, buy the other album, which is class."
1,"A resource hog, many errors, but....","I purchased this product on a recommendation from PC World magazine. I don't think I made a good decision. This product has been a mistake from the first update. I loaded SpySweeper and the product immediately required an update. I don't mind that, one must stay ahead of all spyware, but the program really taxed my system's resources. I have 2GB, a AMD dual-core with four 160gb SATA hard drives, and it really slowed down my system. It also produced many Windows XP errors. I submitted the errors to Webroot for analysis and I even emailed technical support, but without much resolution. I decided to remove it and use Norton's Anti-Virus Suite instead. Maybe your experience would be better, but I cannot recommend this product. Now after saying all this, there was absolutely no spyware able to stay on my system when this product worked, but again, the performance of the product in other areas makes this experience unfortunate."
2,Very Sloooow !,"I've used Spysweeper for a couple of years and there's no doubt that version 4.5 is a useful tool.However , in recent months it has become ridiculously slow to the point where it's an irritation. I've looked for software conflicts but have never succeeded in improving its performance.By switching to Counterspy as my main anti spyware weapon , I'm back up to speed."
2,What's the Point?,"Spysweeper slowed down my machine so much it was absolutely useless. When I removed it ... voila, productivity."
1,very bad service,"I had webroot for less than one year, ended up with a new PC due to a very bad virus that got past webroot. And then about 18 months later I get a bill on my Visa for a new subscription. There was no invoice or bill emailed to me alerting me to this just there it was. After being on hold for over two hours I tried emailing and yes they called the next day. The guy said they had no record of me or the transaction. If you like your computer and your visa account do not use webroot."
1,Version 5: a major disappointment,"I have had Spy Sweeper Version 4.5 for many months and was very happy with it. I upgraded to Version 5.07 and have had nothing but issues. I have Windows XP and 2.5G of memory. Spy Sweeper windows appear but are non-active, cannot be closed and do not respond to mouse actions. With the internet turned off, Spy Sweeper window appears stating internet connection not available; again window cannot be closed. Sometimes there are as many as 3 Spy Sweeper ICONs in the System Tray (bottom of Windows Interface) and there will be 3 sets of windows on the screen; all 3 non-active. I sent an email to Webroot concerning these items; received an email congradulating me for buying their product. Stay with version 4.5 or look at other products."
1,Get Something Else,My brother was given Spy Sweeper when he purchased his computer from Best Buy a few months ago. He's had some problems with pop-ups and slow performance. I checked out his computer using using two other reputable spyware removers and found anywhere from 17 to 29 threats while 'Spy Sweeper' caught a total of ZERO threats. 'Spy Sweeper' is easily the worst spyware remover I've ever used. The free version of 'Spyware Doctor' I have one my computer blows 'Spy Sweeper' away and I'm shocked this program gets so many positive reviews.I highly recommend getting 'Spyware Doctor' or 'Pest Control' over 'Spy Sweeper'. I honestly wouldn't even use 'Spy Sweeper' as a secondary spyware remover.Now my brother is going to have to go and shell out another $30.00 on a spyware remover that actually works. I'm glad I didn't buy 'Spy Sweeper' for my computer.P.S. - I just went to save the review and got another pop-up. Please consider getting something else.
1,Crashed my computer -- beware of this software!!,"I was using the trial version, and since the trial expired, I bought this software today (directly from Webroot). When I installed it, it crashed my computer (twice). I purchased a two-year subscription, and I am kicking myself about it. I noticed that one reviewer mentioned that spy sweeper has compatibility issues with Adobe. I have Photoshop Elements installed on my machine. Perhaps that's what is causing the problem. In any case, I recommend that you beware of this program!"
5,WHOA MOMMA!!! THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!,"I had a probelem with my computer, the internet was acting funny, it was really slow, and weird websites kept popping up.I didn't know what the problem was, and my current antivirus software would scan for 10 to 15 minutes, and then delete someing or other, but it would always return.Finnally, i asked my mom for help. She gave me this, and i ran the scan on my computer.It came up positive. AND BOY HOW!!!NOT ONLY DID IT DETECT SPYWARE COOKIES THAT MY OTHER SYSTEM HADDN'T, BUT IT ALSO FIGURED OUT I HAD ACCIDENTALY DOWNLOADED A TROJAN LOADER ONTO MY COMPUTER INSTEAD OF A CLIP OF THE ZAPRUDER FILM!!!(I was doing a JFK project at the time. NEVER again will i use Wikipeadia, because that's where i got this nasty from)AND IT CHEWED IT TO BITS AND OBBLITERATED THE REMAINS!!!!THANK YOU WEBROOT!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM!!,"Once you get the program on your computer, and it fails, WHICH IT WILL, there is no way to remove the program not even using the Remove Program in Control Panel. And, if you do buy this program and load it on your computer, DO NOT, set the program for Automatic Updates. This program is not what it is advertised to be. I will have to find another software that will remove this program as Windows can't remove the program from its own files.I would look elsewhere for Spy Sweeping software as this program is not worth the time, expense and problems. Spybot Search and Destroy is still one of the better programs in this category."
1,Very Poor Application Wish I never ordered it !,"It works poorly, Free version of ""AD_AWARE"" does a better job. Don't waste your time or money on this product !!! (Retired Network Administrator; computer support since 1987)"
1,Don't buy this program!,"Bought and installed the program on my desktop computer. Afterwards the PC started freezing up and crashing - removed program and PC worked fine again. Then installed the program on my laptop - same result, experienced lots of crashes and PC freezing up. Uninstalled the program and PC was fine again.No support from WebRootDon't buy this program, it's a waste of time and money!"
2,Spyware,not impressed when compared to Lavasoft's Adaware product which is free. I actually use Webroot's product as a backup to Lavasoft
2,Out to make money,"Overall, there's nothing overtly wrong with the product. The problem is that they (and others) try to lock you into an annual subscription plan while raising prices every year (for example, these guys went from charging less then $20 for a 3-user version to charging $20 per user). Ther are numerous similar products out there and they all pretty much work similarly. The thing is, none of these products would have been necessary if Microsoft made theie Windows products better. All of these guys are now trying to make as much money as possible while they can because they all know it's not going to last. Most of these companies will be out of business in another couple of years. The product may be necessary now so buy the least expensive one out there from a reputable company. No matter who you buy from, the product will slow your system down."
5,32 bit spy ware,"I would like to say that this is a good product but this item is "" not for 64 bit computers "",so read first,in this age of technology."
1,Spy Sweeper 5.5 will KILL your computer.,4.5 was fine until I updated it to 5.5. You will Kill your computer going from 4.5 to 5.5. The update killed 2 of my 4 computers before I could remove Spy Sweeper from them.
2,SPY THAT CRASHES,"good at catching the cookie spies etc. BUT........IF YOU LIKE HAVING TO TURN YOUR COMPUTER OFF EVERY 3-4 MINUTES BECAUSE IT CRASHES....get this..........I have windows xp., tried 4.5, and for above reason switched to the 5. in hopes they would have fixed the spyware problem...but no. I now use NOADWARE..maybe not quiet as good as Webroot, but close enough, and no more crashing. If Noadware could incorporate some of Webroots tools,that would be fantastic..but nothing in life gives you EVERYTHING.....but"
1,Poor mangement services,"I purchased two copies. I installed one on MS Windows XP Homewith a direct connection. It nailed the spyware.The second copy was installed on a MS Windows XP Pro behind ahardware firewall. For security reasons this firewall onlyallows HTTP on ports 80, 443, and 563. Webroot's programupdate works in this environment; but their definition updatefailes. For the definition updates, they use HTTP over arange of ports. Microsoft, Intuit, Trend Micro have allfigured out that non-standard ports are unreliable.On both systems I scheduled a weekly sweep. It works onthe XP Home version as there is only one user. On the XP Prosystem, it fails because the adminstration user was not loggedin at the time of the sweep. Again for security, I rarelylogin as adminstrator; so this sweep feature is useless.I am also running another company's anti-virus, which has noneof these problems. When Webroot's software requires renewal,I will give it the boot and try someone else's anti-spyware."
1,Conflicts with Windows utilities such as Chkdsk,"Webroot Spy Sweeper did manage to find and delete a few more cookies on my system than did the TrendMicro suite's spyware scan, but it caused major problems on my system, because it installs a feature that take control of the disk at boottime, meaning that necessary Windows programs such as CHKDSK (used to correct disk errors) won't run at boot time, instead complaining the drive is locked by another program. Webroot suggest uninstalling their program and running a RegClean utility, but that doesn't clear this up, I had to restore my system to the state it was in before I installed SpySweeper. So SpySweeper itself is installing spyware and creating more problems than it solves! If you buy this program, at least create a restore point bfeore you install it so you can reverse the process if necessary."
1,WHAT GARBAGE,"FOR US PREVIOUS USERS OF WEBROOT SPYSWEEPER PROGRAM, WE KNOW HOW WELL IT TEARS THROUGH AND ELIMINATES 99.9% OF THE THREATS OUT THERE. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO DETECT THINGS THAT OTHER PROGRAMS CAN'T, BUT VERSION 5.0 IS THE WORST ABOMINATION OF WEBROOT SPYSWEEPER I HAVE EVER SEEN! ITS ALMOST AS BAD AS WINDOWS ME. DO NOT UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION UNTIL THEY HAVE ELIMINATED A LOT OF THE BUGS THAT EXIST IN THE PROGRAM. ITS EXTREMELY BUGGY AND DOESN'T PLAY WELL WITH NORTON ANTI-VIRUS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM BELIEVER IN SPYSWEEPER, IT WORKS REALLY WELL, BUT 5.0 IS A FLOP. ITS A SERIOUS RESOURCE HOG AND TECH SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTANT. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
1,5.0 release a major CPU hog--never should have made it past QA,"I was very happy with the previous 4.x version, but Webroot really blew it with this one. When I ""upgraded"" to 5.0, the SpySweeper.exe process suddenly started chewing up CPU like crazy. Periodically it would slow the system to a crawl for minutes, and more frequently it would hog all the CPU for shorter periods.And get this--as it fires up these cpu-hogging episodes it steals focus for a second or two from the active window, so whatever you're typing goes into thin air! This happens several times an hour, so it absolutely drove me crazy.Submitting a trouble ticket on this priority-1 problem got me not a single response from ""support"", so I finally had to uninstall the product so I could get some work done. This is a completely unacceptable release that should never have made it past QA."
1,timewaster - very very frustrating,"bought a copy and agreed to try their Beta version - it slowed down my computer and uses 99% of the CPU - so I tried to uninstall it - and couldn'twrote to webroot - their response - via nonreply emails - in which they ask you to contact them !!! - was to tell me to uninstall the programconclusion - they don't listen, don't respond, and are unreachablestoooopid - and very very annoying"
1,Avoid at all costs,This software should be avoided at all costs. It is buggy and they make their money from troubleshooting their own bugs.
1,Do not buy this product!,Like many reviewers here I had to remove this product from my computer. After installation everything slowed to a crawl and frequently froze completely. Now I'm far from a computer expert but everything was back to normal as soon as I removed it. The only reason it has one star is Amazon won't allow reviews with no stars.
2,Don't Bother!,An egotistical diary of a young American nurse who spends 80% of the book talking of her dancing partners and her Virginia family connections. Insulting remarks about the French military medical officers with no respect for their past experiences before the Americans arrived. This is obviously a vanity press item. Skip it and read Charles Frye Stewart's book instead.
1,No better than a comic book,"I used to live for the next Lindsey, but the past few have been unreadable. Trite, silly and formulative to the ridiculous are the only adjectives I can think to use. This last is the proverbial straw. The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue is agony. Vincent is a bore and Larissa is insipid. They can't hold a candle to Angel or any of the Mallorys. I won't waste another dime on a Lindsey novel."
1,ugh,"I love a decent trashy novel once in a while, especially around the saccharine holiday season. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Larissa, a sappy and beautiful goody two shoes, is the object of Vincent's (a very Scroogey character) desire and revenge. The story comes to its obvious end. Sadly, it's not even a good trash novel. It's pretty boring and banal, the characters annoying and having little attraction between each other. Grade: D-"
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,"Well, at least it wasn't a waste of *much* time. As others havesaid this book is a great let down for most Lindsey fans. It's been years since I've been willing to buy one of her books in hardcover, and I'm usually glad I waited. (come to think of it-since they've been available in hard cover they haven't been that good!) It wasn't awful, but it wasn't much good either. If you're like me and can't stand to miss a book, set aside a couple of hours to read it in the library. I sure hope Ms. Lindsey returns to writing wonderful novels like she used to."
3,Home for the Holidays,"I wish I had checked the reviews before I purchased the book! I have to say that the tension between Larissa & Vincent seems lacking. I would reach the midpoint of a chapter & it would leave me hanging. There are no long descriptions in the romantic scenes, that have made Johanna Lindsey's book so popular. Usually takes several days for me to finish a novel, however, I finished this one in a day!"
1,Also dissappointed,I too like previous readers was very dissappointed. I have also been a diehard Lindsey fan but it seems that she ran out of ideas as soon as she went to hardcovers. This small book and the previous small(The Present)one were both huge dissappointments. Maybe Ms. Lindsey needs a break or needs to get back to her old stories(We never tire of the Mallory's) Where is Jeremy's story?? We're all waiting. I will of course keep buying as I can't give up on a favorite. Please keep trying!!
1,Disappointed,"I love Johann Lindsey. So I wait with anticipation for her books to be released. However, after reading Home for the Holidays, I was extremely disappointed. Her poorest work thus far.This book was written in a hurry, I believe just to get it published. I can not believe, that Ms. Lindsey, took her time with this."
1,Save your money and your time,"This book, by far, is the worst Johanna Lindsey book I've read. I found the characters uninteresting (and down right boring) and the same can be sad for the plot. The more I read, the worst it got on and on (it's a very feet that I made it to the end). Save your money but more importantly your time. I would have given this book a negative star if it were possible."
2,Disappointing Lindsey,This was the worst Johanna Lindsey book yet. The plot was very superficial and I never could make myself care about the characters. It was extremely short and not very well written. I have read all of her other books and have really liked most of them. This one read like it was written in one day. What a disappointment.
2,A mediocre story.,"It feels like the author just rushed to write the book to meet some deadline. The story is very superficial. It is also quite short, even though it is sold as 339-page book. But the print and spacing look much larger than average book. It's definitely longer than a novella, but much shorter than a novel. I read it in half the normal time I would read the book this size.This was my first book by Johanna Lindsey, and I think I might have started with the wrong book."
1,:( : ( BORING!,"I usually enjoy johanna lindsey's writing, but this one's not worth the time or money. I agree with another reviewer that it is short, poorly written, and superficial."
1,SOOOOOOOO Disappointing,"I was so upset with this book, I threw it out when I finished reading it!! I love Johanna Lindsey and own almost all of her novels, but this one is beyond stupid...I could not get into it. It took me five days to finish it and I usually read a book in a day. I only finished it because I dont like leaving a book unread. The characters are so ridiculous, they never develope, and I hate Larissa. She is so naive and stupid, and who in their right minds would just let a man(and practically a stranger at that) into her bed after only a few weeks, especially after he kicked her out of her house!! I wait longer than that for some of my boyfriends and I generally like them! There was no plot, no developement of a relationship, it was terrible. I would say to anyone who is interested try Johanna's Malory series or Savage Thunder, or Captive Bride. Those are true Lindsey works, not this garbage."
5,Love It,"I enjoyed the book , I know others didn't . Johanna Lindsey never lets me down .A great read anytime ."
3,Decent . . ..,"This is a good little book to read during the holidays. Decent characters. Decent plot. However, it's shorter and less detailed than Johanna Lindsey's usual works. It was obviously written as a holiday treat and not as one of her regular novels. It's tepid whereas I would describe some of her other works as hot. I recommend borrowing this one from the library before committing to a purchase."
2,I agree! Not JL standards.,I wouldn't waste my time on this one. Try the Mallory's or re-read them. I will.
1,Extremely disappointing,"The plot is marginal, the characters hardly developed. As a reader, you don't care what happens to the hero or the heroine. It's even hard to believe they fell in love, given the scant number of scenes where they actually talk to each other.Aside from all that, although the book was 300 pages (of very large print and 3 page chapter breaks), it felt a whole lot longer. This was one romance I could put down, again and again."
3,Same old formula,"While I almost always enjoy Lindsey's books it seems that she did little more than add a little meat--very little-- to the bones of her usual skeletal ""lust at first sight...love to come after"" frame in this story. Shallow character development reminicient of every other character she's developed...bring back the quality of the ""Mallory"" books!"
5,Great story,"If you enjoy Johanna Lindsey's books, you will love this Christmas book. Her stories draw you in, making you feel like you are a part of them. This is no exception!"
4,Loved The Heart But Missed The Heat,"I think Ms. Lindsey's books always do a great job of conveying the feelings of the characters. She always lets me spend enough time in the heads of the hero/heroine to get to know them, and she does that in this one as well. Because I understand how and why, I believe in the story and the characters. In this one, I got the plot and the emotions, but I didn't really feel connected to the ""heat.""If you're a fan of Ms. Lindsy's work - and who isn't - then this one is well worth reading. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because I like a book to carry me into the angst so that I can feel like I'm right there in the fire with the characters. It's a hard journey though - I know that from my own work - and Ms. Lindsey's tale is engaging and uplifting. If you like revenge dished out with a little more heart than heat, this one should be right up your alley."
2,I didn't connect with the characters or story,"I read about 1/4 of the book and then skimmed through the rest. I agree with the negative votes here. The characters are poorly developed. Vincent was totally cruel and unlikeable. There was simply nothing the author could do to redeem him in my eyes after the start of the book. The only character I ever really cared about was the ill brother Thomas but he seems to exist just as a reason to get her into the house with Vincent and even Larissa seems to forget about him as the story progresses.I know that the intent is to craft a story about how a man who has never known love, finds it and is transformed. Unfortunately for me it instead comes across as unreal and uninteresting."
2,Where's The Lindsey I Know and Love?,"I'm paying more for Lindsey's books now they're in hardcover but I feel I'm getting less of a story. Larissa and her Viscount have little to draw them together. There is no tension, no build up. They are drawn together much to early in the book and are left with a weak excuse to keep them apart. I have bought and read every Lindsey book as they were released, buying them sight unseen without reading the covers, because I knew they'd be great no matter what. Yet lately I feel let down. There was little in way of description and I was pushed through the book at break neck speed. It was like Ms. Lindsey couldn't wait to be done with this one. My only hope and wish is that it's because she's anxious to work on another Mallory novel. What say you Ms. Lindsey, next time will we get our money's worth?"
1,This cannot be Johanna Lindsey,"I have been reading Johanna Lindsey's books forever. They are wonderful and I cannot wait for a new one to come out. After reading this new novel, I know that Johanna could not have changed her writing style so much as to not see anything familiar. This is not a book by Johanna Lindsey. Whoever wrote this book, is a beginner writer with no history. Johanna, it is impossible for this book to come from your brain. It just does not match up."
2,Lacks likeable characters,"This is definitely not one of Lindsey's best works. I kept reading it and hoped that as I got closer to the end, it would get better. I just didn't come to care for the characters like in many of her other books. The man was given no reason to love the woman other then her stunning good looks for the vast majority of the story. The details didn't fit together well and at times I felt I was being force fed information to move the plot. The premise to the story was a good idea, but it felt like this book was written under a short deadline. I own all of Johanna Lindsey's books and love her writing style. This one just missed the mark."
3,very good movie except for the lack of m.a. till the end,a very good movie abo;uty his family being kidnapped and he becomes a ninja and gets them back
1,Miami Vice Meets Martial Arts,"I am a big fan of martial arts movies and have seen all of the ones starring Sho Kosugi. This is by far the worst one mainly because it is closer to a Miami Vice episode than it is a ninja movie. For any martial arts aficionado, stay away, the fighting scenes are few and far between, and very poorly choreographed and filmed."
2,Ok.,"It said ""good"" condition on the website when i bought it. it was, in fact an almost worn out rental tape. It got the job done though. ""good"" condition must not mean what i thought it means though. I would have classified it as ""fair"".Campy c rate movie."
3,pattern and color are off,"the quality of these sheets is fine. but the stripes are a lot thicker than what is pictured. and the baby blue color isnt as bright as pictured either. they fit a little big for my full size mattress, but not too bad and i dont mind it."
1,I didn't notice any change,"I followed their instructions but didn't notice any change in the appearance of the spider veins. Spider veins go in my family and I've had them from an early age- perhaps this might work better for age related ones, but I doubt it."
5,Dancemaker,"As glimpsed by director-interviewer Matthew Diamond, Paul Taylor is at once a brutal task-master, insecure about his work, and overall, a somewhat remote human being, owing to a solitary early life in foster care. But a pure love of the dance is the unifying, invigorating force for him and his company, and we are the beneficiaries in this candid, behind-the-scenes look at a bona fide artistic institution."
1,bad fit,the jabra 250 fits the ear very poorly.. I had to hold it to my ear just to get it to stay and that defeats the purpose of the thing.. needless to say I only used it once and then returned it.. I found out later that I was suppose to receive 3 gels pieces with the thing when I bought it and they only included one and it was the smallest in the set and that probably had a lot to do with why it did not fit...needless to say I was still not impressed with it's design..
1,bluetooth,Well it didn't last very long.It got to where it couldn't find my phone and wouldn't pair at all.The earpiece made my ear sore.It was a waste of money
3,"Not one of his best, not even one of the good ones.","Being a big fan of Ed McBain's novels, I was very disappointed when reading, ""There Was A Little Girl"". It just wasn't as good as his other Matthew Hope novels. By putting his main character, Matthew Hope, in a coma I think McBain made a big mistake. True, it was an interesting twist watching his friends and colleagues try to figure out what happened to him while geting a glimpse into his head and learning what happened but, the mystery he was trying to solve was boring. The ending left me feeling empty. I hate to say that it was one of my least favorite McBain novels"
2,Big Disappointment,"After reading the summary to ""There Was A Little Girl"" I couldn't wait to crack into the book.To my surprise the novel was a little bit like a piece of gum when you first put it in, minty and refreshing. Then as you keep chewing it looses its appeal and then with even more chewing it is completely flavorless.I also was not impressed by the racism, the judging and the language. Overall this book was a big disappointment."
3,"Without the aura, not so special","These live performances are in decent radio sound, although fairly wiry and thin by studio standards. Horenstein is a cult conductor, but without the aura of greatness imposed from outside, I didn't hear anything really special in these performances. The BBC forces are not remotely up to the Vienna Phil or Berlin Phil technically, so the Ninth Sym. comes off as pretty scrappy and without depth of Bruckner style. The Eighth is better (not that the LSO sounds great, just good), yet again I hear a decent performance in the ""inward"" German tradition, but if you set the most spiritual movement, the Adagio, against readings by Giulini, Boulez, Harnoncourt, and Karajan (I own four of the latter), what you hear from HOrenstein is certainly very good but by no means inspired."
3,exlente,"nesecito comprar este libro en la version , en castellano, editada por pavilton books limited , mail me at dozo@sinectis.com.ar Thank You ! Mariano"
3,You need to be older to love those songs,Not comparable to the great cd Buena Vista Social Club. The songs are more classic cuban style.
5,"Simply, the best.","I ordered 2 copies of Mi Sueno and sent one to my 30 yr. old nephew who recently married. He and his wife called and said they loved it, too. So a 90 yr. old musician can communicate with 30 somethings through music. That restores my faith in human kind."
5,Fleetwood Mac Original,This album is awesome. Every track enjoyable. Albatross always great but loved the remix at the end.
3,Nothing special,The blues that Peter Green plays is not to bad but he isn't a good singer.I try to find a gem once in awhile but this misses the mark.
3,"Good, But The Two-CD Package is Far Better!","Given the number of great songs reworked by the Peter Green era band, this compilation isn't very complete. The songs on here are great. It's that you are missing a ton of awesome music by getting just this one CD. Get the two-CD set. You won't regret it."
2,"Good, but not good enough.","The music was good enough, but the distortion was irritating. Returned after only listening once. Was charged for shipping return even though I have the Amazon credit card which makes me wonder what exactly the benefit of it is."
1,Unfair Pricing for Libraries,"Others have commented that the price for this dvd is too high ($195). But it's available for only $29.95 at the filmmakers website IF you're an individual who will be viewing it at home. The price listed on Amazon is the so-called tiered institutional pricing for libraries. Because libraries loan out videos or let teachers show them in class, filmmakers think they have a right to charge libraries more -- much more. There is no legal basis for this approach; it's simply a matter of what the market will bear. As long as libraries continue to purchase videos at inflated tiered pricing, filmmakers have no reason not to overcharge us."
4,excellent quality,"This is a quality steel light. Clamp works well as long as what you are gripping is at least 3/4"" thick.Contrary to what the add says mine came with a bulb in it so you don't have to order a separate bulb."
3,Overpriced for what it is,"While I like this lamp, and I am keeping it, it is overpriced. I immediately replaced the halogen bulb with aHigh Power 6W LED MR16 GU10 base Flood 45 Soft White Lamp. It was a very good choice for this lamp.The good:Nice appearanceStrong gooseneckThe bad:Cage is obtrusive, but easily removed for LED useClamp is weak (I drilled two holes in the upper clamp and screwed it to my workstation).I am keeping it because I need a good high intensity lamp for my electronics workstation and this fits the bill. It mates up perfectly with the Artisan Lighted Magnifying Daylight Desk Lamp w/Clamp, which has a more fluorescent quality. Between the two, doing close electronic assembly is easier and much more gratifying."
5,Very Customizable Lamp,"I bought one; I bought a second; now I'm buying a third. I love the endless possibilities of this lamp. Very well made product with a strong, very useful, padded clamp."
3,Lamp,This product was very good. It was purchased as a gift. The recipient could not use it so I returned the item. The company provided support for returning this item. They were very helpful.
4,Allegorical book helps efficiency,"This slender little book, of fewer than 100 pages, can help you with your New Year's Resolution (or any time of the year) to be more efficient at the office. The author is a psychologist and consultant who helps companies enhance productivity and train managers.Genett's book is written in the form of a story about cousins who have different management styles. One is successful and has time for a nice family life and hobbies, and the other's life is a mess. But the second learns Genett's Six Steps of Effective Delegation and becomes as happy and successful as his cousin.It sounds hokey, but it's actually an effective way to impart these tips. This isn't some dry textbook, but a useful tool for learning how to efficiently delegate responsibility - and be successful at it. It's short enough to breeze through, and the tips are clearly marked along the way."
2,Disappointing,"I expected more concrete advice regarding follow up and accountability. Also, I find ""Minute Mangager""-style business parables annoying. The book has some good points, though they could have been presented in a couple pages of punchy prose."
4,Solid book on delegation,A very quick read. It's not earth shattering material but there are plenty of golden nuggets that are easily digestible and transferrable to any person's work life.
2,Short not so sweet,"I found this book to be easy to read, but does not have all the details. You will have to use the help menu to follow the books instructions. Good idea but fell short. I did not use the disk it may have more thanwhat I read."
1,Don't buy this,This bag was filled with bugs. The birds wouldn't touch it. I wish I had asked for a refund.I had to throw it out.
3,Pretty but had issues,"This watch band is HUGE! I have a small wrist and when I took it to get it sized, they had a difficult time getting it smaller by removing links. I asked for another watch band and they didn't have anything even close to fit it. I still love it and it does finally fit, but I had to spend more money just to get it fit me properly. Disappointed with all I had to go through."
5,Great for speaker wiring.,"Perfect size for the speaker wiring portals. Not too small, not too big. There is enough wiring for a small car."
2,Too Wacked Out,"Could have been a good film. Too disjointed. Almost a been-there-done-that plot. Casting was good and acting was not bad. I get the point but blood got a little out of hand even for this kind of movie. Wouldn't waste my time again. Sorry, Bobcat, I really wanted to enjoy this film."
3,"Great Premise, But Fell Short at the End","I admittedly didn't know who the Director (Bobcat Goldthwait) was for the film until the very end credit where I recognized the name, so I had no preconceptions of the show outside the trailer segments. Throughout the movie, I was pleased with the quality of the acting in their roles, and the story seemed to have great possibilities. Unfortunately, the ""Butch Cassidy & Sundance"" type ending didn't provide the closure I was hoping for. It instead provided an abrupt stopping point when I thought the movie couldn't possibly be over.Lucky for me, this rental was FREE. Otherwise, I certainly would not buy the film or pay more than $1 to rent it from Redbox or Blockbuster."
3,A little too slow,"I understand what they were trying to do with the movie, although the pacing was pretty slow, making the movie less amusing than the preview made it out to be, especially since the preview gave away a little too much about the plot of the movie. I almost felt like I was re-watching something I'd already seen because the preview gave so much away.Anyway, it wasn't terrible, but I certainly would rather have saved my $10. Amazon nabbed me with the ""pre-theatrical rental"" shtick though..."
1,The most ridiculous piece of crap .... ever,"4-5 stars for this garbage? Really? What was so interesting about it? Senseless killing of human beings?This IS a typical Michael Moore, MSNBC, CNN everything is Tea Party's fault, America sucks, cops are stupid... etc propaganda. To that, it was SO lazy and horrible in execution, that one needs to REALLY want to see this junk to be able to rip it to shreds (as it deserves) without being accused of not knowing what's in it. Well, I do know, and again, I can say with an authority - it sucks big time.This movie does not even pretend to aspire to show something interesting... it is just that bad.... IMHO, that is. THERE IS a reason that this movie can be viewed for free, 1-2 months after it was released."
1,Arrogant,"Roxy (the female lead) is a typical sassy, left-leaning young adult girl with a foul mouth. She is agnostic and hates religion, spirituality and the people who practice it. However, she is not criticized at all in the movie when people like her are just as big a problem with contemporary American society as anyone else is if not more so. I do not consider this a spoiler: there is one particular scene where a right-wing pundit called Roxy a feminazi upon which we are put in his POV staring into Roxy's eyes as she shoots us again and again. I felt that was over the top and revealed the directors bias. It's not only the spoiled rich girls that deserve to be shot Roxy, I wouldn't mind someone coming along and straightening you out either."
1,Only hate for the Right. . . . what about the left wing wackos?,"Trailer looked good, movie was not. once you see a trend of political bias and senseless violence it's just not funny. I like jokes on everyone but if we are going to laugh at wackos let's laugh at them all not just make fun of people on the right wing."
1,"I really really wanted to like it, but it sucks.",I was hoping this was a new 'Falling Down' or at least would be worth watching. This really would have been my kind of movie if it were written better. The preview I saw for it looked great but the movie is shockingly bad.
2,just plain scarey,"The premise was good, and I'm as fed up with pop culture as the next guy. But somehow going into a movie theater or TV studio and gunning eveybody down doesn't seem as alluring to me as it once did."
2,I must have been watching a different movie,"I like Bobcat's stand-up comedy and LOVED Shakes the Clown. I thought this movie would be equally funny. I was wrong. I get the idea, shooting people that are really annoying to you like the cast of Jersey Shore, but I didnt find this movie at all funny. I didnt laugh once.Murdering children, babies, teens because they annoy you? That's tough to make in to comedy, even if you are trying to make a political statement at the same time."
2,Has moments but pretty shallow overall,"This movie is pretty shallow and adolescent in its content, so its fitting that the heroine is a young, self righteous teenage brat. Yeah yeah her character had a bit of content but by in large the movie focuses on very sharp tempered heated debates punctuated by pretty random and pointless killing sprees. As such the movie tends to become so random and spontaneously violent that it is most fitting that the two protagonists end up getting shot and killed at the end, a fitting end to the monotony of the increasingly unimaginative violence of this film, degrading to both gun-rightists and modern liberalism at the same time."
4,"well done, Bobcat, well done",Forget that it is a social commentary if you can. Forget whatever politics you personally subscribe too. Forget that it is written by Bobcat Goldthwait. The movie is good and well worth watching. Period. Good job Bobcat. You made a movie that i really liked. thank you .
2,Bobcat Goldthwait spends over an hour and a half conveying his deepest psychological fears.,"Except that he doesn't know that he's doing it, because he isn't self-aware enough to know that.Bobcat's characters are basically a pipeline for his boring ramblings about all his pet peeves, which he obviously spends way too much time thinking about, because this guy just goes ON AND ON. He is constantly acting like a complete sourpus, always ranting ad nauseam, like that guy who just doesn't know when to shut up and can't help his negativity from spilling out of his mouth like vomit. His relationship with the teenage girl is platonic, but first he spends at least five minutes justifying this fact, and then later in the movie has her slowly unzipping her dress with the door open.I gave it two stars instead of one because they mowed down some Westboro Baptist idiots. That was fun to watch. If they had just put that scene first, it would have made his character better."
3,Poor Frank...,"Looking back on this movie, it reminds me a lot of a video game I once played called ""Going Postal"". No, Frank is not a postal worker, but he is fed up. He's tired of people just being jerks. He's tired of people who feel as though they're somehow entitled to inconvenience everyone else. I agree a lot with most of what Frank says throughout the movie. There is some particularly good dialogue regarding the way people treat each other and the absence of civility in our civilization. It's fairly predictable, though a couple of plot twists are unexpected and fun. The acting is solid and the directing and editing kept my interest. The opening sequence was just a little over the top for me, and I recommend skipping the first five minutes if you're a parent and sensitive. Other than that, it's a fun ride in which one can vicariously live out his or her dreams of blowing mother effers away who take up two parking spaces or cary on conversations during a movie."
4,Good movie,"This is a very good movie, with many memorable scenes. I recommend watching, if you can relate to the frustrations of daily life in a society that's lost it kindness , then this movie is deffanitly worth your time"
4,Dark and Honest,"Too bad killing is not the solution, but it sure feels good. This is definitely not for people who take movies at their literal meanings."
2,Ok movie that had great potential,"This movie could have been hilarious. At times it spewerd just too much typical hollywood political BS, but for a few moments it was great. It would have been more interesting and balanced by including the ""give me free stuff"" plague that is sweeping America as well.Or maybe they could have included the bigotist Bill Maher as a character, or the witless comedy of Jon Stewart, or hit just a little harder on the media and how they manipulate every story to cater to their political ideals.If you ignore it's political leanings or are indoctrinated enough to not notice them then I guess it's an ok movie.I thought it would be along the lines of Idiocracy, but instead it stole an idea or two from that movie and turned into political diatribe."
3,Unfortunately Society is like this,"Well I am 45 years old and never owned a cell phone...My kids grew up and 2 years ago I cut the cord as TV just really stinks, between chefs, housewife's and people moving to New Jersey to get drunk is not my idea of entertainment...I hate radio morning talk shows, so I listen to music that's 40 years old just to avoid it...Watching this movie just shows how bad our society is...Cell Phones in my mind are the worst, everywhere you go people have those things up to their ears...WHY"
1,Horribly Offensive,"I watched this through to the bitter end because I paid for the DVD, after liking some of Magnolia's other productions: Marley, Hunter, Centurion, etc. But this wreck just kept driving toward the cliff. This is a wretched exess of violence, nastiness and rage, with an attempt to justify as criticism of the mindless dribble on TV, which the lead character watches just as doggedly as the office mates and others he villifies. (How about just turn it off!!). Attempts to parody reality TV and talent shows instead show a sociopath's descent into madness and the killing so easily done in our gun worshiping society, and the innocent bystanders and accomplice he takes with him into oblivion. Nothing likeable, nothing profound, just a nothing film. Should have stopped with the dirty tampon-throwing scene. Was going to share with my friends, but this is going into the trash instead where it belongs."
1,Smells like burnt crap,"Amazon you need to fix your review system. I noticed that some people liked this movie and some did not. In fact the reviews seem to be all over the place. This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ever. It was just sadistic. Everyone that saw this movie with me agreed..... burn it. I threw it away, I was not going to waste my time burning it. Besides, I believe they were being sarcastic. This is a terrible movie and I have to honestly try to understand who would actually rate this at a 5 or even a 4. Or a 3 or 2 for that matter. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie. Buy anything but this movie. DO NOT!!!!! pay attention to the people who gave this either a somewhat favorable or favorable rating. I'm so upset with the rating system on amazon right now. I know you don't know me I'm just some guy on the net, but I'm trying to do for you what amazon or the some of the other guys won't do for you. If you did buy this, remember, I warned you."
2,Yipes!,"This is one ""disturbed"" movie. As another reviewer stated its worse than the culture it criticizes. It started off as a spot on satire and ended up more like an MK-ULTRA brainwash film for Manchurian candidates. Very unsettling but not in an enlightening way and even more unsettling that a lot of people gave this 5 stars since the nature of the film itself is the sort of thing that the character Frank hated."
2,"Evil, Yet Intriguing","God Bless America is an evil movie. Yet it is intriguing. I just don't think it's fun to watch stuff like this after what happened in Colorado this year. There is even a scene in this movie where four people are gunned down in a theater. Sound familiar? I also disagree with the hate of pop culture in this movie. The main character hates a show (that is similiar to American Idol) so much that he wants to kill everyone who works on the show as well as its fans. Being a fan of American Idol, I really hated those scenes of the movie. I'm not going to say that this film didn't have its interesting moments though, because it does. It's just a shame that buried under the interesting moments, are moments that are depressing and vile."
5,Very Dark Comedy,"that would make a great companion to ""Idiocracy."" There is a dream sequence early on where the main character shoots a loud baby next door. If you can stomach that sort of twisted humor, the other violence is more cartoonish. It's eerie and sad how accurate this snapshot of our vapid and soulless culture is at times. Bobcat is a smart and perceptive guy."
5,Awesome movie!,"This movie shows what is really wrong with America, and then does what we all want to do sometimes. Beware, it is violent and has strong language so it is no family movie. It is however, humorous and clever. It is definitely worth seeing."
3,pretty good,Interesting movie. Kinda bloody and twisted comedy. The acting is good. I never heard of the actors. But overall pretty good movie.
3,It was all good... Untill they threatened NASCAR fans and Country fans..,"I like the idea behind the movie, but the aim was WAY off... You can see the Liberal Manifesto is you pay attention.."
2,"Too much, too late...","After watching trailers for this movie, I was really hyped up to enjoy it. Who wouldn't want to watch a movie that gives the ol' bird to the US o' A. Well, when this movie revolves around a dated reality singing show that's been on for 7+ seasons, it's hard to even take this movie seriously anymore. Sure, the title, trailers, etc., make it seem like a comedy, but there was some real hope for a serious discussion on the pitfalls of American society.What irritates me the most about this movie is Frank's monologues. They're extremely boring and re-hashed at least 3 times throughout the movie. Roxy joining in the diatribes doesn't help as she follows his same patterns.There are some good moments. Just the scene where he attacks the reality show star in her car was really well done. Perhaps if this movie came out about 5 years ago, it would have been more relevant. For today's world, we need some of today's topics to curse America!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was pretty excited to see this film. I knew it was a black comedy and it seemed, from the trailers, that it was targeted at those we all sometimes wish we could ""off"". However, I got about half way through and had enough of the bashing on what you could tell were supposed to be conservative ideas and people. Again, I have to see another movie that can't think of anything new? Just ""kill conservatives, that'll make the world better"". It gets old. However, I also just got bored with it. I didn't know where they were going with the story. How could these two, after being shown on the news, driving around in a banana boat of a car, not be noticed by police or anyone else?I knew I shouldn't take the movie too seriously when I rented it, but this was just asking me to go way too far out.Too bad too, because I love Bobcat."
2,Interesting premise but fell short,"I was looking forward to this movie. The trailer was excellent, but I was looking for more witty than bitter. It seemed like a rough cut that could have been worked a bit more and made much better, and I'm not talking about the filming or effects as I realize it was low budget and could forgive that. Some of the parodies were a little too far fetched, like the doctor. A couple of times I laughed out loud but it was mostly slow and I felt the female lead could have easily been a target of the movie as she was pretty annoying. Maybe that was on purpose in order to show we all have obnoxious qualities."
2,Easy to watch,"While watching you can almost imagine how you yourself would react to the variety of situations and it is kind of ""B"" rated in my opinion."
2,"Loved the concept, but...","...I was hoping more for ""Natural Born Killers"" meets ""16 and pregnant"". Over all there was some decent sentiment, but I wish, if I were spending time watching a movie about the idiocy of american entertainment, that it was more cathartic. While violent, the story line seems to be a bit disjointed, there's the odd-romance between the characters, which was cute and occasionally heart-warming, but came off sometimes as preachy instead of a stark contrast to what they stood against. It could have worked as a contrast, but there is so much ground to cover on killing off idiot americans that I would have preferred that be the focus!It was entertaining enough to get me to smile, but I was hoping for some really original surprises to make me laugh, which unfortunately weren't forth coming."
3,Fun indie movie,"This was a weird and fun movie. The chick was attractive as all get out, but was underage for such a comment at the time, I think. The plot was silly, but had some great moments. We loved the part where the jerk taking two parking spaces got blown away."
1,Ignore the number of good ratings,"This is one of the most evil hate filled films ever produced. The protagonist is a mass murderer that teams up with a little girl who also becomes a murderer, and they kill anyone whom has a viewpoint differing from their own, including teenagers in a theater, a glen beck spoof, church members, and the cast and viewers of an American Idol spoof. If there was any message to this film it would be that media fries the brains of Americans, but this is the biggest piece of brain frying crap to ever be thrown together. Save your time."
1,dumb.....,"A feel-good simpleton movie for the person you know, that thinks everyone agrees with their political perspectives, only to have 8 out of 10 walk away from the conversation, wondering what planet or drug they are on. This movie was obviously written and produced by hypocrites that don't deserve the freedom that this country has unselfishly provided them."
5,"Hate reality shows, Wesboro Baptist Church or Glen Beck...then you're gonna love this movie","Are you one of those people who feel ill when exposed to reality televison? Did you watch the moive Idiocracy and think, ""This isn't just a movie, it's a prophecy."" Do you let idiots win arguments because it just isn't worth it to waste the oxygen? If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then I highly recommend that you watch God Bless America.God Bless America has to be one smartest films I've seen in years. This isn't some generic garbage that Hollywood poops out, with the intention of pleasing everyone...it's the exact opposite. This movie has a target audience, and you'll be 100% sure if you're that target audience, if you can make it past the first five minutes of the movie. If you can't make it past the first five minutes of this movie, I would suggest you go and enjoy some Jersey Shore reruns."
3,Comic relief - just shooting off a little steam,When I am force into the morning rush hour and have to listen to talk radio just to get the traffic report I will always think of this movie.Frank (Joel Murray) gets fed up with reality TV and the rest of the trash programs that pose as entertainment. He gets an opportunity to correct the worst of it. Young Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) observing the cure forms a mission in her mind. Is it possible that this daring duo in the style of Bonny and Clyde can actually correct the ills of American entertainment or will they escape to France?The film drags at first trying to get us involved in Frank's world. But you are ether in or out to begin with. Soon it starts to pick up speed as the mission is formed between Frank and Roxy. Eventually coming to a predictable and satisfying end (be sure to listen to his ending diatribe); no surprises here.Just a lot of fun kibitzing.
2,The message is sad but not that deep,"I found the show entertaining and watched it all the way to the end. For some reason though, I kept thinking that I was holding out for an ending that would convince me the time wasn't a total waste. Didn't happen. I enjoyed Redford & Newman in Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid but the acting was much better - this show doesn't meet the same standards."
5,What a unexpecting good movie,"Wow! What a great movie. It has a wild storyline that is good action. The characters stay in character and the story carries out an action line that is believable.I just finished the movie. I am impressed!I agree with one of the reviews that said the movie has an underlying message, but the surface message is good enough for me.I really like the surface message of the story.Watch it!"
2,One sided. Goldthwait only disagrees with FOXNews!,"This is a funny movie but it will be nice if it was ""fair and balanced"". Really tired of the so called independents who are targeting conservatives only. Really easy to beat on O'Reilly (he keeps saying that he is a simple man and indeed he can take it).On the cover of the Blu ray it says ""one jerk at a time"" and ""taking out the trash"". But what about the lap dog media CNN, NBC, PBS, ABC, CBS, 60 minutes, MSNBC etc? They are spewing propaganda rather than news. Still waiting to see real news on these chanels. Just now before the elections silence is deafening. I guess everything is perfect in the liberal world.However, still a funny movie. Two stars is the max that it deserves, for its liberal bias, but had huge potential!"
3,Disappointment,This movie was very disappointing. I watched the preview and thought it looked like a lot of fun but it really was not. It had its moments and it was a decent idea just poorly executed.
1,"disturbing, to say the least",A movie that glorifies sociopaths. Watching this after a string of recent shootings also brought home how awful this movie really is. The overall point the writer was trying to make with the movie is lost amongst the Quentin Tarrantino type fetishization of violence.
1,Disgusting,"While observing many of the ills of society, this movie empathizes with urges for mass killing in the face of frustration. While this movie tries to point out the toxic culture we live in, this movie creates more toxic waste than it exposes. Violent premise piled with ridiculously gratuitous violent execution makes no kind of statement at all. It's just violence for the prurient interest. What a waste of good acting, and my time. I should have known better."
1,Worse Than the Culture it Criticizes,"The other one star reviews cover most of the pertinent points. This movie fails both as entertainment as well as in its moralizing. Riddled with cliches and contradictions, it mistakes pretension for intelligence. For all the condescension by the movie and its fans, the protagonists' rants and murder montages spoon feed a simple, unoriginal mush to an audience predisposed to agree. As depraved as American pop culture may be, this blood-drenched rampage fantasy is more so."
1,Crap,"Awful crap, garbage, pointless junk, nonsense pos movie. I have said it all but it wants more words for this dumb movie's review."
3,"Preachy and creepy, but the message is there","If you can get past the creepy factor and don't mind listening to the leads preach on endlessly before they kill people, then this movie is for you. While the messages this movie tries to convey about how we treat each other and our general immorality are poignant, Joel Murray comes off as the odd creepy loner whose message is doomed to be lost. It was an interesting film, but not one I'd recommend without reservations."
4,Good but could have been better,This is a very good way to spend a couple of hours. It is pretty funny. Way to many people are trying to read more in to the movie than there is. It is a funny look at some pretty sad stuff.
3,A good idea...,"that goes too long. So much to like. Bad timing with the Auroa Co shootings. A lead that makes the pain and despair obvious, but can't deal with his own kid. Dads obviously wrote this."
4,Fantastic,Thanks Bobcat for a terrific movie. Fantastic Cast and parody play off. I will be recommending this move to all friends who have some mental capacity.
4,Great Dark Comedy for out times,"This is a great dark comedy that taps into our wishful thoughts when you see unreal ""reality"" tv or shock commentators. It is a testimonial of our times where ""rude"", ""loud"" or ""outrageous"" is the way to fame, instead of personality, talent and substance."
5,Best movie since Idiocracy!,"Not since I watched Idiocracy, have I enjoyed such a pointed commentary on the dregs of our society. This movie encompassed my feelings that surfaced after watching the aforementioned film and brought them to life in grand cinematic fashion, Well done Bobcat, it's like you are in our minds when we have these fantasies of righting what ills our society at large. This my be the seminal work of your career!"
4,Small but cute,The cookie cutters are small as some of the reviews mentioned. But as a little something to go with the check as two podiatrists marry... they are just fine!!
4,Cookie Cutter Review,"I love this product. My only concern when ordering was that it didn't give the dimensions of the product. The largest cutter is approx. 3-1/2 to 4"" (not accessible at this moment)...the perfect size for tea sandwiches for a baby shower."
5,Adorable,"These cutters are so cute but as another reviewer mention, the smallest one is VERY small. On the plus side, you could make a LOT of cookies if you use it!"
4,La Crema,"This is a great, solid, straight-forward espresso machine that (when the beans are cut to 3.5) makes a perfect espresso with a thick head of crema on the top. I've owned two Grangaggia's in the past and have used a neighbor's Melitta and this machine beats both easily. I've owned mine for over ten years and, aside from semi-annual decalcification with 50/50 white vinegar and water, has been completely trouble free.I do wish there were enough clearance for a mug. I bought double-espresso cups and problem was solved.Enjoy!"
4,great book to use for SAT II's not for SAT I's,"My father had attended the conference given by this author in October 2004, and brought me the textbook so that I could use it in my studies. I am a self teaching student and I can say that this book teaches more that plugging numbers into the TI. I have learnt how to use the calculator for solving an equation or an inequality of any kind which has helped me a lot in the 2C test. However if you are planning to use this book for the SAT Reasoning test, yes it is inappropriate but it is not meant for the SAT I test. Anyways, I took the test a week ago and I am pretty confident that I will score way above 700 in the 2C test."
5,One of a kind!,"I had taken the 2C test in January for the first time when I realized that I should have learnt the calculator techniques better. Then I saw Barron's 2C book; it had a chapter devoted to the TI calculator. I had great expectations that eventually turned into a complete frustration. Then a friend of mine, who is an expert TI user, recommended me this book. which teaches the TI 83 calculator in and out in a step by step fashion. Thanks to this book, I may even score an 800 on the 2C test this time."
5,Excellent shortcuts to the SAT II Math tests,The SAT IIC test was never as easy before. I am in Johns Hopkins now and I am probably one of the first of those fortunate people who did this book. I recommend this book a great deal.
2,Difficult to interpret,"This book is very comprehensive, so it is a good reference book at any level. However, it is often difficult to interpret and tends to jump around from topic to topic. I do not think this is a good book for someone who is looking to learn statistical methods from the ground up or for someone who is doing a self-study, but it may be useful to people who are taking introductory statistics and want a book that provides more details on methods. There are almost no examples in this book. It definitely does not hold your hand."
4,Cute and fun,"My son likes this quick and cute rhyming book about Elmo and his dirty puppy. It has great vocabulary and bright, fun illustrations."
2,bought it for one song,"Easy to hear why Lane Brody never made it to major stardomI was desperate for the original ""over You"", from the movie, Tender Merdies. Yes, Brody does it...but....it is atroscious.Gonna sell this. Oh yeah....still hoping for the original version. Even Betty Buckley doesn't do it as she did in Tender Mercies.Michaelene"
5,Very Complete Reference Material!,"This book was spotted in a library branch's reference section. Having a big interest in superstitions and the origins of them, I found this book great! The index is very complete and easy to locate many superstitions and how they originated. It not only is a great reference source of the history of America, it is very interesting! It is a book that can be read from cover to cover and also to be flipped through. Two thumbs up! And, no fingers crossed either! :)"
3,Not good enough,The book is not good for beginners in vba and it is not good for programming big project.
3,Pages missing from book,The book itself is absolutely fantastic and a really good tool for reviewing EKG's. There was however a few pages missing from the book (had been cut from the book)! Not so nice.
3,"Not Perfect, but OK","Not perfect, but certainly not a one-star anime. The animation is simply amazing. Rent it for that if nothing else. Compared to Plastic Little, every other anime looks like Scooby Doo.Remember the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark where Jones is about to face a giant with a sword, then rather than fight him, Jones just pulls out a gun and shoots him? That unconventional not-what-you-expect touch made the move unique. A lot of the fights in Plastic Little are like that. That's why some people here are upset because rather than another set of big super-fights, the heroes/villains use guile and end it quickly. It's unconventional, but after seeing dozens of other animes, it's nice.If you're not familiar with anime yet, I would suggest you pass this one up and get Tenchi Muyo, Birdy the Mighty, or Ah! My Goddess! The plot is much easier to follow in those animes. If you've seen a lot of anime, and are looking for something new, Plastic Little may be what you're looking for."
2,My opinion,"Animation and drawings. 5 stars. Impressive.Sound. 3 stars. Good but not outstanding. It won't be the next Star Wars hit.Story. 1 star. Too fast. No drama. Emotionless. Except for topless it is not quite interesting. Surprising solutions came from nowhere. Relationship between two main characters (both female) seem like an affair, not like a friendship.Feeling. Just for rent. Perhaps it may worth the time due to drawings. But if you spend money... There are better things you may buy:Superdimensional fortress Macross, Sol Bianca, Bubblegum crisis chapter 1 to 4, Wings of Honneamise.If you see this movie on the shelves, leave it there and warn your friends."
2,Bad Movie? You're Soaking In It,"Ugh. This mishmash of fan service, horrible English voice-acting (for you people who do dubs rather than subs), and an all-around headache-inducing plot is, at best, worth a rental. Don't buy it. It crams a plot that would have been better done over the course of two hours into 45 minutes, and as a result details like character development and plot coherency fall by the wayside.If you like cheese by the way of fan service (Satoshi Urushihara really loves the female form) ... /still/ only rent this one. You'll be seriously peeved off unless you're looking to vidcap the bath scene about 25 minutes in to death."
1,Horrible,There were many typos in the book. Some of the questions didn't make any sense. I will be sending a letter to the publisher about the poor quality of writing in this book.
4,Entertaining,"This story revolves around a group of young people: one a thief by trade, one a knight by trade, one a cartographer who gets lost all the time, a large guy (not yet sure what his role is), a white dragon baby, an elf girl, and some character called Kitton (not sure yet of this one either). The animation reminds me of Flint the Time Detective. The storyline involves fantasy and the group must ban together to overcome the centipede monster who hampers their trip back from Mount Terrason. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone. Some of the story can be a bit childish and the elf girl seems to whine or cry all the time, if you can overlook this it was worth the ($$$). Also, it does contain 5 episodes. Hope this helps."
4,"Fortune Quest, first time ever seen before","Fortune Quest: Journey to Terrason, I watched the DVD before first time. I liked to detail and main character about their adventure journey to Terrason continue. But we didn't have any Fortune Quest DVD to any store. I saw some internet on YouTube.com before first time and have Fortune Quest episode 13 and 14 but I forgot something on the history lost everything in last year."
2,"Good little Anime show, but wish they would release the complete series","Fortune Quest is perhaps one of the Anime shows that while it only contains just a little bit of mature material, it is mostly a kid/family friendly Anime/One I would recogmend to those who are starting out.The 5 episodes seem to tell one simple story, but I remember that the series got allot better later on so without the complete series being translated, I will only give this a 2 star one."
3,Akward sizing,"Size was too big (5'7"", 145 lbs, bought a L), and the stitching on the arms and neck hits weird. Wish it was longer. Still shows the back of your lower back, so I'm sure if I wore it that would still get burnt. Trying to exchange it, but slow response from Company."
5,Another career highlight.....,"Yet another stellar effort by Joan Armatrading. She uses a blues basedapproach to many of the songs and for the most part they are all winners.Exceptional vocals and her guitar fills are smooth. The songwriting isalso what makes this one special, I was surprisedI just didn't think Joan was ever gonna take us on a ride like this.Past her mid 50's she could just go on writing beautiful love songs andmid tempo gems but she still had a winner in her. If this is her lastcollection before she sets sail, this is a hell of a way to end a careerthat has few peers. She is a delight to groove to on this set. Many favorites all through out this 5 star class act. Rock on Joan."
2,Put me into the blues.,"I love Joan Armatrading and have all of her albums. This one, however, I'll be giving away. I was really looking forward to hearing Joan get into the blues and bought this album without hearing it. Mistaaaaake! There's one song in this selection that could be described as 'blues-ey"" - the rest I don't quite know how to describe other than to say, this album ain't blues. I found most of the tracks agitating. My advice is to listen before you buy. It saddens me to have to give Joan a bad review, but hey, one dodgy album out of so many isn't bad!"
1,disappointing,"Wish I had listened to samples before spending money on this one. Repetitive and annoying lyrics. I haven't purchase a Joan A. CD for quite a few years, this reminded me why. Too bad, great talent, just has gotten very boring."
2,Disappointed with Joan,"I have been a Joan Armatrading fan since the 70's and love every album of hers except this one. I am just not used to Joan singing the blues like this. My husband, who is not really a fan thought this album was excellent."
2,Flawed Product,"Other reviewers are correct that this product is flawed. All three disks are suppose to be in color -- the studio's own website says that they are -- and yet disk two and three are in black and white. On a more positive note, the color on the one disk that was properly transfered is much richer and deeper than the color on the episode versions contained in the box sets. Shame that the other two were screwed up since they did such a fine job on the first."
5,melissa & doug classic wooden figure eight train s,This was a great gift for my grandson. He did have a bit of a problem at first connecting the cars because he had not used magnets before. Once he got how they worked he was in love with his train.
5,Great starter kit,"I bought this for my son;s 2nd birthday. He loves it and gets it out all the time. I think there's enough pieces to have a bit of variety (certainly over the models that are just loops), but it also didn't take a big investment in case he wasn't interested. It's also somewhat educational; itgives kids a chance to practice motor skills as they interlock the tracks and it lets them develop imagination and problem-solving skills as they try to come up with new configurations."
5,nice little wooded train set,"All of the pieces fit together just fine and the train stays on the track just as well as any other wodden train set. It is nice to have other options than ""Thomas"" train sets. My son actually hates ""Thomas"", and will run out of the room if he even hears the music from the show(!) He is 2 1/2 years old and loves to put the train tracks together. all of the flat tracks are reversable so you can actually make more layouts than just the figure 8. This is the perfect starter set for us."
3,My son loves it BUT what's with the red train?!,"My 18 mo son LOVES trains and train sets, so I thought this would be a great little set for him to play with and take with us when we travel. It is a pretty good size and the tracks are fine, but the red train that comes with the set is too big to go under the bridge. What's up with that?! It makes him so frustrated when he tries to push the train around the tracks and everytime it gets stuck under the bridge. Why would they make, much less include, a train that doesn't fit on the tracks? We also have another M&D train that has 4 wheels that always derails. This toy sometimes makes him more upset than happy even though he loves it. Frustrating!! Not sure if ours is just defective or if all of them are like this, but because of the train issue, this isn't something I would buy again."
5,Love this track set!,Both my boys (almost 4 and 2) love this set. We have combined it with other sets and make larger tracks across the floor. It is very durable and fits thomas trains just fine. I would recommend this set to anyone. It is definitely worth the money!
1,The people who give this a positive review did not play with it.,"The train doesn't fit under the tunnel... need I say more? The track itself isn't to bad, but the fact that you can't use the train it came with on the tracks makes it useless."
3,Cute train set,This is a cute train set. But it needs a little more to be worth the money. My kids like it for the most part.
1,missing pieces!!!,"i was so excited to get this set for my children- opened it up for christmas for them and there are missing pieces! the quality of the railroad is very nice, just wish i got all the pieces in the box because now we cannot play with it. also, the magnets dont keep the trains together llike advertised."
4,perfect starter train for 2 year old,"My 2 year old loves this train. He figured out how to assemble the tracks in a short time and now reassembles them in different patterns. Simple and cute, perfect for a starter. However I think it's made in China :("
4,Nice set but bridge arch is not high enough for battery operated Thomas trains,"This set has been on my living room floor for about a year. My 3 year old grandson loves to play with it. The only problem he has...the arch for the train to pass under is just a little to low for some of his trains to clear (he has several different kinds). I tried to raise the bridge a little by using little felt pads on the bottom of the bridge pieces, but I wasn't very successful . The set works fine with the little train designed for the track...just not his Thomas trains...which he likes because they are battery operated. I have finally just removed the track from going under the bridge as a solution. It is easy to take apart and put together."
2,Check to see if your train fits under the bridge.,"I love these sets. I remember playing with one (Brio) that I had when I was little, and so I was thrilled when a friend of mine got one for my son. I was soon disappointed, however to find that for my set, the train does not fit under the bridge. Or, I should say, it doesn't unless the straight track is positioned exactly in the middle of the arch. The way these pieces wiggle around, it's tricky to keep the tracks in that perfect position, so the train comes down the bridge, around the turn, hits the bridge and comes to a dead stop. Very disappointing. I don't see other people commenting about this problem, so I suspect it's just my particular set. It might be something you'd like to check, though, when it arrives at your door."
4,My 3yr old loves it!,"This is a great, well-built train set that will entertain him for long stretches of time. The only drawback is the little trainset that comes with the tracks. My son loves that it includes a coal car, but when attached to some of his Thomas trains, this set is constantly falling off the back. I think the magnets may line up at different heights, so they don't have the strongest connectivity. Besides that, a great starter set!"
5,great classic,"Solidly build, great for kids of all ages. Even their parents love playing with the set. Four more short words."
3,My 2 year old likes it,But unless its on a very hard surface it doesn't stay together. It hard for him to put together and he gets easily frustrated . But I put it on his play table and he loves it.
3,awaits the right time and season to be read,"Though this book is touted by many as full of wonderful pastoral gems and theological insights, it remained basically unquarried by me? Perhaps, I still don't have the patience to read good, theological fiction. Perhaps, it was the Roman Catholic twist. Perhaps it was Georges' writing style. No doubt, I do not have the intellectual genius of some that are able to catch the subtle twists and turns of this dying priest's journal. The French names were a bit tricky but not the source of my frustration. That said, there were portions of the book that I found illuminating and insightful and several sentences that are worth pondering or quoting; nonetheless, halfway through, fatigued and bored, I quit. I think this book awaits the proper time and season to be read."
3,Depressing,"I must be missing something...it seems most people have found this to be a wonderful book with tremendous meaning. I thought it was depressing. The priest seems lost throughout. He is despised by his parish and regarded poorly by his superiors (and they ACT superior), who lecture but don't try to mentor him or encourage him. The priest is plagued by self-doubt, struggles with prayer, and feels alienated from God. He is friendless in the world. I kept waiting for things to get better, for some spark of light, but it never came, with the one exception of the brief kindness of the woman coffee-shop owner in the town where the doctor practices. I tried watching the movie but it wasn't much better."
3,Maybe it's not the right time...,"I finished George Bernanos's The Diary of a Country Priest thinking, ""Maybe it just wasn't the right time for me to read this novel."" It's affecting, well written (though how much of that is the translator I can't know) and kept me reading, but... So many people--people I respect--really, really, like this book. It's a ""classic"", but I expect I won't be tempted to pick it up again for a decade or so.One thing I wasn't expecting, but appreciated, was the slice-of-life of France between the World Wars."
2,The Diary of a country Priest,"I did not care for, not what I thought it would be, but then everyones taste is different. Would not recommend."
3,The agony and spiritual ecstasy of the priesthood is here.,"Bernanos's ""Diary"" represents that rarest of glimses into the clerical world: a view that is utterly convincing and completely enthralling! As the author pursues the early life and career of a French provincial Abbe, he simultaneously reveals the sufferings, triumphs, and struggles of the people that the young priest serves. Parallel to the tribulations of their lives, Bernanos lovingly shows how deeply one man, one priest can empathize with those he serves. While Bernanos never became a priest himself, his early life prepared him to write this, his greatest novel. The poignancy of this small novel is one that builds gradually. The impatient reader may, at first, not ""connect"" with the story, but the faithful reader will soon find that he/she cannot put it down. The last 30 pages of this work are one of the 20th century's masterpieces of spiritual prosody that I can identify."
5,An intense touching portait of a country priest's struggles.,"Bernanos' classic is perhaps the most touching novel I've ever read. Its the story of a country priest whose parish is not very interested in religious matters. He deals with this, his personal problems, and Bernanos' descriptions of his struggles are profoundly emotional. I read this book a long time ago, but to this day I remember the impact it had on me. Such feeling and compassion I have never felt for any other fictional character (save Lord Jim). This work is truly a masterpeice. Reading it will change you, forever...."
1,musty,Don't mind old books but this one smelled musty and did not change after 2 weeks airing. Couldn't read it for this reason. Tossed it.
5,Barry Nadell is an industry authority.,"Barry J. Nadell, a Kroll executive, is an industry authority. You can count on the veracity of his book."
3,disapointing,"After assembling the tree, (which was easier than I thoght it would be)I plugged in the 2nd to last part of the tree top and discovered that part of the tree wouldn't light. Arrrr!I loved the concept and am hoping I can get a replacement tree thatworks."
5,Lace,"Excellent mini series. I saw this one at 80's and I was hoping one day watching again and voila, I could buy by Amazon. The story is really good. Drams\a"
4,I Really Liked It,This is a girlie movie with the usual teenage pregnancy problem...but with a twist. The daughter doesn't know which of three woman is her real mother. Lots of unexpected scenes hold your interest as the grown up daughter goes searching for the truth. The setting is in a beautiful area of France. I have watched it many times and feel it is worth buying.
5,A Good Story,An interesting story and kind of a whodunit all together!! Can you guess the outcome before it happens?? Most people guess wrong LOL
1,lace review,"Lace was purchased for Christmas. We opened the new package to watch for the first time on January 2 and there was only one disc in what should have been a two disc set.Lace (Warner Brothers Archive Collection). It is a good movie, dissatisfied with the product."
2,Soap Opera,"This is so typical of many of the miniseries of the late 70's and 80's. They shamelessly wallow in the excesses of the 'sexual revolution' and usually have sensational, lurid plots and poor acting. If it wasn't for the exotic locations and excellent photography they would be no better than your average soap opera."
1,Shortchanged,"I am disappointed with this DVD. I was glad that it came out because my VHS recording is quite poor now.An entire chapter is missing. If the whole story or movie is not going to be published, why bother?This movie was more than 240 minutes long. Buying this movie edition was like buying a set of 4 mugs and when you get home you find out you only have three."
5,Hard to find title,I've looked all over for this title. It arrived on time in good condition.the price was reasonable and i would recommend this to others.
4,Great read!!,"Loved this book, great characters! The story keeps you interested all the way thru and there are some very funny parts to the story. Totally enjoyed this book and moving on now to books 2 & 3."
3,Fun but faulty,"I did enjoy this story very much, but there were just some issues that could not be overlooked.While I mostly enjoyed the characters, there were a couple major plot issues, mostly timing.I do wish Natalie had more sense than the author gave her.This was an entertaining story and I will read the next one as I know authors do grow."
4,"Wicked Blueberry Coffee Cake, oh my....","Murder on the Rocks is an excellent start to the Gray Whale Inn mystery series. I loved Natalie. Her personality is upbeat and stubborn. She's living her dream and finding out there are costs. Sometimes I want to yell at her ""Don't go down into the basement,"" but she still does.I enjoyed the supporting characters and her new love interest, John. There were enough red herrings to keep me guessing on who done it, but not so many that I got confused. I love the natural way the author introduced the recipes into the story. When I looked at the full recipe later, I was taken back in my mind to the part of the story where Natalie cooked the food.Looking forward to Dead and Berried."
3,"Entertaining, but realistically, people...","I'll skip the plot summaries, since you can find those elsewhere. I agree with other reviewers that this new series has a strong sense of place, interesting characters, and yummy recipes. That said, there is still some room to grow for this author. The characterizations were a bit flat, leaving you wondering what is motivating these people, exactly. The ""mystery"" was not that intricate, and the plot is advanced by devices (SPOILER), i.e., Natalie trips into situations (literally!) and works at solving the case because she is just that much more curious and motivated than the local cops. It's all a bit artificial.Note these nitpicks are not uncommon with cozies and I think this author has potential, I just wouldn't put this up there in the 5 stars category. Maybe 3 1/2."
5,Great Book,I love this series. The author weaves a good mystery along with great character development. I look forward to the next in line.
1,Not my type,I am a big fan of M C Beaton and am looking for something similar. This is definitely not it. I read it but found it boring and the writing uninspirational. I don't plan on buying her other books.
3,"Happy cozy, in spite of silly bits","I always enjoy ""cozies"" and this is one with, unfortunately, some silly parts in the plot. Natalie makes herself a prime suspect by hiding evidence, leaving her fingerprints all over the guest's room (obviously fresh prints)tampering with the mail, misrepresenting herself to suspects - what hasn't she done, actually - and as has been said by reviewers, there are inconsistencies with the amount of food in the house and Nat's supposed brokeness.As a first novel, the overall plot is okay though traditional in terms of developers and peaceful coves/islands with plenty of birdlife and the local fighting against glitzy resorts.The recipes look delicious and I can't wait to try them!"
2,"Not very good, at least to me","I started off enjoying this book, but the typos, inconsistancies and nonsensical story line lost my interest. I have to agree with others who've posted about the negative aspects of this book. I am not familiar with the term ""cosy mystery"", which is used in several reviews, so I'm not sure if that was part of it. I did fast forward through a lot of the end, especially the endless trips across the water and the fight with the killer. Sorry, this just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,"Review of ""Murder on the Rocks""","This is the first book in the series about female-sleuth Natalie Barnes. Natalie has moved to Cranberry Island Maine from Texas and is the proprietor of The Gray Whale Inn Bed & Breakfast. The book is centered around the current events and activities of her B&B.; Plus there is the concern of what the proposed development called the Cranberry Island Premier Resort will do to the town and to Natalie's business. And of course there is a murder and Natalie finds herself in the middle of the police investigation. So she must do some fast sleuthing to clear herself.I liked the descriptions of the coast of Maine - it made me feel like I was there! But I found the characters to be a bit one-sided. And I would have liked more background on Natalie herself.All-in-all, I think this book is a good start to the series. I'll be reading more of them."
4,Great first book,For a first novel this book was great it had many twists and turns and kept the reader wondering what would happen next I have already recommended this book to several people who have also enjoyed it. The recipes at the end are a bonus and will attract anyone who likes to bake.
5,"Murder, suspense, intrigue and blueberry coffee cake.....","What more do you need? This is a great book, the first in the Gray Whale Inn Mystery series. I don't know if it was the plot, which took many twists and turns, the characters whom you felt you knew right away, the on-target description of the beautiful Maine coast, or the fact that the author is a fellow Austinite--perhaps it is all of the above. The mouth-watering recipes didn't hurt either!!I wish Karen MacInerney the best in her upcoming books."
5,Add This Author to Your List of Favorites,"If the subtitle on the cover is a promise, I will really look forward to more ""Gray Whale Inn"" Mysteries. The main character is appealing, the setting is wonderful, and there are mouth-watering recipes too! Reading this book was like taking a short vacation to Maine in just the kind of B&B I'd love to visit. The murder is nicely plotted, lots of possible suspects, and while I had pretty much figured out ""who done it"" fairly early on, the ""why"" was a good surprise, and it was fun to go along for the ride..."
4,Enjoyable Cozy Mystery,I enjoyed this book so much I bought all of the books in the series. I am on book 3 now. They are delightful books with just enough suspense and crime. The characters are enjoyable.
5,"Murder On The Rocks, Rocks!","I love a good mystery. Times when you just need a good, clean easy read that just keeps you going, you should read this book. It is number one in a series of the Gray Whale Inn Mysteries by Karen MacInerney. The writing is funny and she keeps you in suspense. I have gotten the next book in this series also, and plan on reading the third soon. If you are a Murder She Wrote fan, this will fit right in."
5,great book,This is an excellent book I have enjoyed it so much can not wait for the newest one to come
3,Series shows promise,"This cozy mystery series features innkeeper Natalie Barnes. At the opening of the story, Natalie has left the stressful, big city life behind to operate a bed-and-breakfast on Cranberry Island in Maine. Unfortunately, things aren't as idyllic as she had hoped. Trouble abounds when she finds a dead body and winds up being the prime suspect for the murder. To make matters worse, it appears someone wants her out of the way as well. The plot doesn't always hold together, but the series does show promise. Gray Whale Inn Mystery, book 1"
3,"woks great, wish it was healthier.","Works great, tastes great, digests well. I just wish it was healtier with all the junk quality ingredients, and artificial sweetners."
2,Tastes Like An Overdose Of Rolaids,"I can't speak for the nutritional value of this product, but I can say that it tastes like dog. I'm not buying it again."
1,"Same song, different verse","More racism, sexism and homophobia disguised as ""morality"". Don't waste your time, it's been said before and said much better."
5,Survival Kit is A Life Saver,"The Survival Kit for the Elementary School Principal is full of practical advice, common sense solutions, and scores of forms and letters that are of instant use to the busy practitioner.The resources included are true ""time savers"" and reflect the seasoned and reasoned practice of a wise, politically astute elementary principal. Tips and techniques for creating a school vision and building and sustaining morale-- all-the-while developing a positive school culture are offered.The accompanying CD is a true bonus. I simply inserted the CD, downloaded the included Acrobat Reader, and voila, I had within my reach, ready for adaptation, many useful, relevant, and well-written forms, checklists, and letters."
1,Not complete,"I only received Volume B. I actually only needed Volume A but was willing to pay for both books to get it. But I didn't get it. I'm not very happy. The company won't respond to my email's either! Lousy,"
4,A CD That Grows On You,"I used to feel the same way as previous comment contributors who disliked the CD. I only liked the title track, ""It's Not Over"", and ""I Will Love Thee"". But like most songs we hear on the radio, the entire CD grew on me. I learned to not be impatient for the vamp. Gospel music has done that to us nowadays. Most artists want to vamp before they do the chorus. (Forgive my sidebar, but anyway)""Somewhere Around The Throne"" takes about 2 listens before you like it. ""We Shall Be Made Alive"" has more than one bridge, which might turn listeners off at first, but it's a very powerful song.And while most people LOVE ""Anytime, Anything, Anywhere""- I absolutely disliked the concept of a weird title and a contemporary sound. But now, I really love the song.The CD is awesome, but I think that people want every song to be a hit. This is not a Michael Jackson album from the 1980s- it's a gospel CD. Therefore, listeners need to give it a chance and enjoy."
2,Wilmington Chester Mass Choir,"I have heard many songs by this renown choir. I was excited to purchase my first cd. Sadly, I found this cd disappointing. While the choir has tight harmonies and excellent direction, nothing stood out like on previous cd's. Would I recommend this cd? No. Would I purchase another one from this anointed choir? Yes."
3,Simply Average,"This album just didn't do it for me. I'll admit I bought it simply so I could teach my choir ""God Is In Control,"" which is a 5 star track, but the album is not even close to 5 star! I enjoyed ""Somewhere Around The Throne,"" and ""Anytime, Anything, Anywhere,"" but other than that the CD was honestly rather average. It's nowhere near on the same level as Ricky Dillard's, James Hall's, or John P. Kee's choir CD's."
1,this CD bites,"These songs are not sung by the original artists. I was expecting to hear Alanis, Madonna, Barry White, and Abba, and instead I got a bunch of untalented nonames."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This rack was very inexpensive which was great, but when it got to me two of the clips were pulled off. Also the mounting hardware is just two hooks that sit on screws, it's just not enough support when trying to pull the cues out. I like how it looks and the price, but that's really it."
2,Pieces missing,"Box arrived opened and all hardware installation was NOT included in box, along with the instruction. It appears that the box was opened prior and hardware and instructions was taken from my box to send to another customer who had the same problem? Other than that I think it may have been a nice pool room addition. Will return item."
1,Poor product,It broke the first time I tried to put a cue stick in the holder. Then the second one broke also. Very poor quality! Would never buy again
1,No hardware,This product was ordered in time for a party in a new rec room and came delivered in a quick efficient way however there was no hardware supplied though the box says clearly that all hardware included. Unable to put together without having to go to the hardware store to get needed supplies.
2,Looks good.,This product is just what I was looking for. I wanted a inexpensive rack to hold both balls and cues. It was easy to put together but mine was missing a couple screws. Only thing I didn't like was the way it hooks on the wall. It is hung with 2 cheap hooks. I would have preferred some sort of slot system for holding it more securely to the wall.
3,"update, please!","So many tracks have changed or been built, I wish they would create a new version of this book. Get all the newest and best in there in a new edition, please!"
4,So where's the Glen?,"This is a fabulous book. I wanted to say that so my only nit-pik can be taken in proper context. How, I repeat HOW, can the Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York have possibly been left out of this book? It's probably because I attended the Grand Prix several times in the late 60's, that I am flabbergasted by this omission. Other than that glaring omission, I loved the book."
5,So Intriguing,"The whole series is so delicious, so secretive, so scandalous...Reading it makes you feel as though you are part of all the drama. I go to a private school, albeit a co-ed one, but everyone reads them. Even the girls who don't bother to study read them as religiously as they watch the OC. You should read the whole series, or you need to in order to understand this book, but why not? I'm looking forward to the next book, because based on the gossip in this book, the next book is looking very promising!"
4,Nothing Can Keep us Together,"Another fantastic novel by Cecily! I loved this book. I read til 1:00 every night because I just couldn't put it down! This was definitely one of my favorites because throughout (basicly) the whole book, Serena and Nate were together. Although they're not my favorite couple, it's much better than just having Nate put with some random girl. Truthfully, I would have loved to see more of Blair-less of Serena. I just like Blair the best. I'm actually going to be quite relieved if Jenny isn't in the books anymore. I'm not HER biggest fan! But I really did like this book. Except, the kiss at the end was kind of uncalled for..."
3,Getting bored of this,"Everyone graduates and has a party. To tell you the truth, I'm getting a little bored with all the partying, shopping, hooking up, breaking up, and getting back together. I mean, how many ways can you tell the same story?"
5,Yes,Wow this book was REALLY good! Surprisingly Cecily made the two most boring characters Daniel and Vanessa interesting and juicy for once. I couldn't believe what I was reading because it was so good. The only story I didn't enjoy as much was Nate because the same thing kept happening with him. Hello I need variety!
4,Gossip Girl #8,"This is one to tread if you are a Gossip Girl fan.I recommend that you read all of the previous Gossip Girls books in this series before trying to read this. It helps if you know all the background of these characters =) .All of these books are my guilty pleasures of reading. They are fun to read and you dont have to think much to get through a book. They are short too, which makes getting through a book a breeze."
1,They Have Sex in Dressing Rooms,"As a parent of a daughter, I was disappointed at the twisted values of the characters. Selfish, hedonistic, material, snobish, I could continue but I'm sure you get the drift. They are NOT the kind of characters I would want my daughter to emulate, and unfortunately many girls do. For those of us that grew up thinking that a Judy Blume novel was a little daring, these Gossip Girl books make Blume look like Blue's Clues in comparison."
5,Gossip Girl Series,"I love this series I have been reading it since book #1 and it is the best. Everytime a new one comes out I have to get it. I can never put the books down, it pulls you in. I hope the series never ends because I don't know what I would do if it did."
3,omg,Ok...i'm like the bigest gossip girl fan on the planet! nyway i hated this book (out of all of theM0 because blair and Nate HAVE to be together. Like them not being together is NOT an optionif u agree with me then ur smart
1,Wish I could give these 0 stars,"These books are absolutely inappropriate. They are aimed at teens, but they send such a mixed message about drinking and sex that its a wonder the author can promote these to teens, she must not have a conscience. Teens today are being bombarded with pressure, pressure to drink, pressure to do drugs, pressure to have sex, they don't need the influence of these books in their lives. And for those who are wondering, yes I have read them , they leave a bad taste in your mouth thats for sure."
3,More Literary Than Science Fiction,"This book has a very literary feel about it. James Patrick Kelly has some quite wonderful, evocative passages, some intricate, subtle, and flawed characters, and a topic that resonates both with current events and with lovers of Thoreau. As an exercise in science fiction world-building (both political and geographical), however, there is a lack of complexity and reality that I think many scifi readers will find disappointing. Add in a few jumpy plot conveniences and a fairly silly and non-credible major character (The High Gregory) and you end up being vaguely dissatisfied. You may have gotten some extremely rich and tasty literary calories, but at the end you are still hungry. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion."
2,I think I was missing 100 pages,"Well, it looks like I am in the minority here. I read this book in an evening and wasn't impressed. I understand what the author was trying to do, but when I read Sci Fi I want SCI FI. I want to know more! It seems like I was missing a ton of pages that explained or at least described things more. I'd like to hear back from anyone that feels the same."
4,My 1st taste of Satyricon,"Yes, this is my first Satyricon album and it certaintly won't be my last. Overall the cd is very good but sadly Satyricon seems to be heading towards a more mainstream approach similar to Cradle of Filth. Some of the songs have a nu-metal vibe to them and that is my main disappointment with this cd. Despite that, Volcano still has a more underground sound than COF or Dimmu's latest so hopefully they will hang on to that for their next album. Other than that its quite good and if your looking for some more modern black metal then be sure to pick this up."
5,Amazing black metal,"Reminds me alot of dimmu, this band is in the top five for black metal. I got into Satyricon when i saw the video for fuel for hatred, and this band just stuck. Volcano is this bands best effort in my opinion and i highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of black metal."
2,Sell Out Black Metal,"This is (in my opinion) the first bad release from Satyricon. They have signed to Daron Malakian's label (from System of A Down!!!!!) and now they are the latest addition to the Nu Metal list. Unlike older Satyricon, this cd takes a complete 180 degree turn...for the worse. If you are a true Black Metal fan (old Satyricon, Bathory, Marduk, Naglfar, Dissection, Darkthrone...) you WILL NOT like this cd. This is the complete opposite of what Black Metal stands for...and is. Do yourself a huge favour and don't waste your money. If you want this cd for yourself I would give it to you for free! Not a single good full song on here. However, ""Possessed"" and ""Mental Mercury"" have decent parts...that's it!"
1,RIPPED OFF AGAIN BY AMAZON!!,The ridiculously small size makes this book worthless!! You would think ya might mention that this book is less then 2 inches by 2 inches. Not very practice for little hands. Part of the reason I got this book was because the pictures are hysterical ( not that u can see them in this version of the book).Really who is this book for? My kitten?
2,Not good!,The book is not as advertised..it is the size of a matchbox! Not any good at all for reading aloud to my 1st graders!! Very disappointing!!
1,Mini Book,"Unfortunately this book measures 3""x3"" even though the item description did not have any dimensions listed. When ordering I assumed the book was normal size. My daughter was very disappointed that it was so tiny."
1,"Thomas's Snowsuit ""PAPERBACK""","DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM unless you buy a magnifying glass with it. I am a pre-school teacher and I can't even imagine reading this book (?) to my kids. Really, it's 3"" x 3"" and is impossible to use as a classroom book. This review is for the ""PAPERBACK"" version and NOT the hardcover."
1,Too small!,This book is too small to read to my children. The size of the book should have been made clear in the immediate description.
1,Tiny book,This is a good book but it's only 2 inches square. I expected a full size book so I think I paid way too much for it. Dimensions are important!
3,Miniature Books,"The book itself is wonderful, a great Robert Munsch classic. Unfortunately I did not scroll down far enough to realize that these were mini books - great for fitting in a pre-school child's hand but not the best for reading aloud to a class."
5,Lighten up and enjoy the ride!,"I first heard this story in my education class while we were learning how to do shared reading in the classroom. Being read to in the child's perspective was interesting enough, but to have this book read was a blast. The pictures are humorous and the story makes children and adults laugh. Everyone knows that parents make you do something you can't stand. We have all seen ""The Christmas Story"" with the red-rider bb gun and the infamous overly wrapped for winter younger brother. This book reminds me of that hilarious scene. Once the teacher and the principal get in the act it gets all crazy. In the end, just like you would expect a child to do, he jumps right into his snowsuit when it lets him do something he wants to do, play. This is a sweet story, a good read for children."
1,WAY TO SMALL TO READ,"I ordered this book for my child's classroom not having any idea it is 3.5"" by 3.5"" small. It does not state in the description how small it is. I recommend that you do not buy it, it is to small for your child to read."
1,it's only 2 inches high!,"This is totally misleading, This is a pocket size book, what a waste of money! I wanted this to build my son's library collection, but come on a 2""x2"" flap? What a joke. Not a criticism of the story, but of the seller."
2,Strange unexpected size,I never thought I would have to look at the size of a book before I bought it but I guess I do.This is a funny story but the size is too small and it models poor behavior (saying no to your parents and teachers).
1,Teeny tiny!,My daughter heard the story at school and wanted her own copy. I ordered it thinking it was a normal size paperback childrens book. She and I were very disappointed that it was a mini book (3x3in.) The product description next to the picture doesn't clearly state this.
1,Warning! Book is the size of a cookie,"I may have missed it in the product description but this book is too small for its intended public. My daughter can't relate to pictures this small, especially in a story with lots of text. We try to read tracing my finger over the words to help her with pre-reading prep but that isn't possible with this tiny book. Next time I'll pay the bucks for the full size item."
3,Thomas' Snowsuit,"I like ""Thomas' Snowsuit"" by Robert Munsch Because ot is a good book, but it is a children book, so it's not for adults. It is still a good book. I think Robert Munsch did a good job on makink it. It is pretty funny, also.I also think it is a great book for people who just learned to read.It is really easy to read for me.Other books i like by Robert Munsch are I Have To Go, 50 Below Zero, and Stephany's Pony Tail."
2,A SAD PORTRAYAL OF MY BROTHERS LIFE,"I GIVE THIS FILM TWO STARS, ONE FOR MR.BRATTS PERFORMANCE,THE OTHER FOR THE MS.MORENOS THEY BOTH CAUGHT THE ESSENCE OF MYMOTHER &BROTHER;,THE REST OF THIS FILM [was not very good],ITS FULL FOR UNTRUTHES,IN THE FILMS CREDITS THEY THANK THE PINERO FAMILYKNOWING FULLY THEY NEVER REQUESTED,OUR INPUT, IT WAS SOLEYMADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLOITING HIS MEMORY &LEGACY;, I HAVEA 2HOUR VIDEO OF MIKEY, TALKING ABOUT HIS LIFE MADE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO HIS DEMISE THAT ,MR.ICHASO NOR ANY AT THE FILM COMP.WANTED TO SEE. THEY WERE MAKING THEIR VERSION,MIKEY,S LIFEPS THEIR 10 BROTHERS & SISTER NOT 5,AT LEAST THEY COULD GET THAT RIGHT.IT ALL BULL,,,,.SUGAR WAS NEVER, THE LOVE HIS,LIFE,ALGARINWAS NOT AT HIS DEATHBED,THEY HAD PARTED WAYS YEARS AGO,,THIS ONLY DOES A A DISERVICE TO HIS MEMORY,LEGACY, HIS FAMILYTHAT ENTIRE,FILM COMPANY & ICHASO SHOULD BE ASHAMED IT ,ITSGARBAGE, SOON ILL BE RELEASING THE VIDEO ,AND MIKEY WILL HAVE THE LAST WORD, A DISGUSTED BRO..."
3,"Disappointing, but please check out Ichaso's earlier work","I wish I liked 'Pinero' more than I do. I have a lot of respect for Ben Bratt and think he turns in a yeoman's effort here an Boriqueno poet Miguel Pinero. It's a complete transformation. Pinero's seedy, disheveled persona is a far cry from Bratt's polished, slicked-back 'Law and Order' look. And who doesn't root for Talisa Soto (Bratt's wife)? What a classy lady.The problem is that the jumpy, non-linear, confusing look and storyline of Pinero make it hard to generate any warmth towards the film itself or the characters. Which is a shame, because Director Leon Ichaso is someone I'd like to recommend. His 1996 release 'Azucar Amarga' (Bitter Sugar) about one man's disillusionment with Castro's Cuba is a singular accomplishment and a transcendant movie-going experience. Despite my disappointment at the way 'Pinero' turned out, I'd still urge you to check 'Bitter Sugar' as soon as you possible can."
1,WORST MOVIE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. THE ACTING, THE DIRECTING, EVERYTHING. IT WAS AMATURISH. IT JUST MADE YOU NOT CARE AT ALL. I'M SURE A MUCH BETTER MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THIS MANS LIFE. A MORE TRUTHFUL MOVIE, A MORE INTERESTING MOVIE."
5,soulful and moving,"Benjamin Bratt delivers an outstanding performance as poet/playwright Miguel Pinero. His accurate and believable portrayal of the ""Nuyorican"" deserves much more acclaim than the little attention it received when the movie was first released. While being a Nuyorican myself allows me to engage in the character's world and plight perhaps more than those outside of the community, the internal struggle Pinero faces daily should resonate with anyone who has dealt with less than perfect circumstances. The movie is raw and strikes at the core of what makes an artist both successful and doomed- the ability to allow himself to feel and articulate life's beauty, hypocrisy, and irony all in one breath, paint stroke, song, dance, etc."
2,Disappointing,Short Eyes was GREAT.. Pinero's poetry as well. I looked forward to watching this film for a while... Such a MESS. Bratt did a good job though did over act at times..His Spanish isn't that great so it didn't sound too authentic in the film..Overall it was confusing at times and the direction was not easy to follow.. SUCH an interesting subject..Sad that it wasnt handled as it should have. Milos Foreman should have directed this..
2,Boring,This movie does not do justice to the visionary that was Pinero. Benjamin Bratt is a B-List actor who couldn't fill the shoes of this poet. I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through. Pass.
1,Where is my order ?,We placed the order over a week ago but it says it still has not been shipped ? Please let me know why and when it is going to ship..Thanks
5,"Hard to find, expensive when you do, but a wonderful album","I searched for months and found one on here years ago. It was expensive at the time but not nearly the prices I'm seeing now. Wow!I hope you find one for a price that is not highway robbery, because I love this album. The trumpet playing is so flawless and beautiful. I love the Beatles even more with this album than the originals (is that blashpehmous? :)."
2,What a dissapointment!!!!,"While a great idea, this toy proved to be a huge let down in my house. With 3 little boys the fort did not stand a chance! The toy is made up of ""pool noodles"" that snap in together & as you can imagine, they are as unsteady as spaghetti. The fort barely is able to stay in one place...I do not recommend it for little kids at all, they are too active & don't understand how fragile a fort made of pool noodles actually is."
2,Wouldn't pay [...] for it!,"I got this for my son and we put together a fort, it collapsed the next hour due to unstability. It is not worth [...], much less over [...]. The poles he enjoys playin with hitting things and the covers as capes, but that's about all. You can use sheets and foamwater tubes for that."
5,"Great, creative toy!","I have a boy (4) and a girl (8) and they just got this for Christmas. It is awesome! Yes, I have read the other reviews, saying it is not so sturdy, but all we did is explain to the kids to keep the legs straight and not get too crazy, and we've had no problems. It's easy enough for them to do all on their own, which is very important in our house, as we encourage the kids to be more self-sufficient. I love this fort and the kids have played with it for about 36 hours straight!!"
4,So much fun!,"Santa brought this to my kids - Ages 13, 4, and 1 year old twins. Within minutes we had our first fort and everyone (including my husband and I) were having a blast. It's not as study as I would like it to be - but the pieces snap together so easy it didn't really matter. When not put together the tips of the tube things are hard - I definitely had to keep an eye on the kids while they were playing with this. This is going to be a great indoor toy when the weather is bad and I want the TV off. When it gets nice out it's rated for outdoors too!"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"We bought this for our 5 and 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. After months of having my sofa and outdoor furniture cushions being used as walls of forts, I was very excited to have this set in the house. I was extremely disappointed once the box was open. I found putting the pieces together difficult due to the instability of the structures. When put together it is not very sturdy at all. I would have been happier with more pieces to stabilize the vertical supports or better yet, PVC tubing to build the structure. Less flexibility but more support would have suited my purpose fine. This will most likely be tossed in the garbage. With a company like Cranium I would have thought they would have been able to deliver a better product than this. They are on the right track. My kids are starved for a set to build ""forts"" with. I guess my cushions will have to suffice for now."
4,Great Family Fun,"Our children are 5, 6, and 11. They are always building makeshift tents with sheets and pillows. This is a great alternative -- and much sturdier than their previous attempts. I'll agree that it is a bit unsteady, but I've never worried about the safety of my children or their surroundings. They quickly learned that you cannot tug and pull on the legs if you want the structure to last. Now it's not an issue. There is also plenty of space between the leg supports for children to move around comfortably. It's perfect for our imaginative children. My two youngest have already slept in it. We hope to purchase a second set in the near future."
1,"Great Idea, but not as good as the Invent A Tent","I already had a Invent A Tent that my kids have loved. So when I saw the cranium fort I had to buy it as well. While the concept is the same, the cranium is not as good. The Invent A Tent is a lot bigger and has enough material to cover any fort built. The Cranium tent is a lot smaller, not as kid friendly and I found that the material only covers about half of the forts when built. (Most of the pictures of the cranium fort are not covered in the back where you can't see)Anyhow, I think it is a great concept, the Inventatent is just a lot better."
4,It's fun but...,"Bought this for 4 children to use. They had a lot of fun builing forts, but the finished products were always just barely big enough for one child to play in comfortably. Still, It was great to see cooperative play while they built different structures and the pieces really were easy to use. There are A LOT of pieces to keep track of in one box.I was disapointed with the size of the possible structures that could be built, but since this didn't seem to faze my kids, I'm giving the product 4 stars.P.S. some pieces have small magnetic parts that could easily be swallowed if they were to break away from the bigger whole piece (this happened to us- we had 2 little magnetic squares pieces on the floor after clean-up) so I would really supervise kids under 4 that play with older siblings."
2,not as good as toydle forts,"This is just an example of someone taking a timeless, classic idea like fort building and making it flashy and plastic. I have a toydle fort as well and the toydle fort is bigger, stronger, and better. And it really is just regular pipe and wood blocks as connectors. It has sort of a nostalgic feel to it. Cranium fort is smaller, feels cheaper, and doesn't give the same classic feel as a real indoor fort. Don't by the cranium fort when you can the same, if not less, on something way bigger and better."
5,Great toy!,"This is one of the best toys we've purchased for any of our kids. It's sturdy (if you use the right pieces for the bottom supports), easy to put together, and allows for a lot of creativity. We bought two of them, which I would recommend because there's so much more you can do with it."
5,holds up to 3 boys ages 6-8,"I'm not sure why some other families think this product will not hold up. We love the Super Fort. My son is very roudy and very active. He's the hardest hitter on his tackle football team. He and 2 of his teammates (ages 6, 7, and 8) play with this toy more often than they play video games at my house.I definitely recommend investing in extra parts in order to get the best experience. The design possibilities are endless! We love the Super Fort!"
4,"Good product, but not cheap","I have had the Vx now for about a month. It's the ultimate geek toy. Well designed for use. Two negatives: 1. I've already had it freeze up once and force me to hard reset it. So, get in the habit of hotsyncing everyday. 2. Shame on Palm for selling an appliance, meant to be carried around in your pocket or purse, and not providing a good protective case for it. Plan on spending another $30 to $40 to buy a case."
3,Screen is hard to read,"I recently purchased my Vx through Amazon, and they were great, shipping it to me very quickly. However, I am sending it back and am going to get a handheld with a better screen. The Palm Vx is hard to read unless you are in very good light. It also does not store birthdays and anniversaries that are in my Microsoft Outlook address files that were synchronized. I'm going to get the iPAQ when it becomes available."
1,I wish I'd never bought a Palm Vx,"I was happy, then it crashed!I was not able to sync for a week, I was on the road, and all that recent information I tapped in disappeared when the Palm randomly crashed. If the Palm OS were more reliable, I would not have to sync it every day to make sure in case it crashes on me.For the $300 I paid for this, I feel I should be able to go weeks without syncing, in that the software should be reliable. Afterall, what am I paying for? For those that disagree, I guess I am supposed to lug my laptop with me on the road and sync it about once a day. Wait! I bought the Palm Vx so I wouldn't have to lug the laptop with me. AH MAN!Bottom line, from my experience the Palm Vx is about 95% reliable, which is good, but that 5% error rate can cost you dearly. Palm Vx, neat idea, but do not rely on it to do anything important without syncing dail."
1,Impossible to synch with Windows; dreadful tech support,"An elegant and useful device ruined by frequent difficulties synching with Outlook and lack of a USB interface that would speed connection and reduce port conflicts. Tech support has no toll free line and has, after three weeks, prooved incapable of resolving the difficulties."
5,Going gray with Style.....,"When It came time, I decided the time had come that I required the services offered by a PDA. Then the question that will probably hit everyone looking into PDAs: ""Colour? or Grayscale?""The advantages of Colour are: a higher visual appeal and graphics look better in colour and some high-end models can display pictures. The Advantages of Grayscale are: A large decrease in power consumption. The screen has greater longevity then a colour one. The ability of a backlit display. Also less expensive.The choice for me was an easy one, I wanted a PDA that is small, has good storage ability, and reliable without a huge price tag. The Palm Vx fulfills all of my requirements at good cost and long battery life, I've gone 2 weeks of normal usage before it recommended discontinuing usage until a recharge.In closing I went Gray with style with the Vx a truly great PDAMahalo!"
4,Buy this handheld,The Palm Vx is a wonderful handheld. Hands down the Palm Vx will perform most daily tasks. From the address book to the memo pad the Palm Vx is the best value handheld on the market. It comes with 8MB of RAM although it is not expandable. The Palm Vx will hold tons of programs and downloads from the web. It connects to your PC using a USB port so hot syncing is a breeze. Take it from me if your only going to buy one handheld and color is not important then buy the Palm Vx.
1,It can happen to you,"Well... I had read that some people have problems with the green on/off button, but I guess I never thought it could happen to me. Well, it did and I am not happy about it. My Vx worked for about 5 minutes before it died on me! When I turned it on for the very first time, after charging it fully as instructed, I was able to write a couple of addresses down. I turned it off, and was never able to turn it back on at all! I paid $400 for this thing and it lasted 5 minutes! I guess when they work they are good, but I have seen lots of reviews [here and in other websites] complaining about the poor quality of the on/off button. I am going to research this more before I decide whether to replace it with the same model."
2,battery problems,"I have had my Palm Vx for a little over a year. While it worked, it was great. However, the battery will no longer hold a charge. Since there is no way to replace the battery, I have to send it to Palm and they will send me a new one for.... Of course, I will lose any data that I haven't stored in my desktop (which is about a month of data for me). I think all of the newer Palms have replaceable batteries so I would highly recommend one of these."
3,How much is it worth to you?,"The Palm Vx is great. It's stylish and elegant! The Palm Vx is a great orginizer and it looks great, but is that enough to justify spending twice as much as the competition costs? I'm sorry, but I just don't think so."
1,Windows 2000 and USB connection not supported,"I purchased the Vx for use on my 2000 machine along with a USB conversion kit. They don't work toghether. Palm claims their beta drivers will allow the use of the USB under 2000 however this is not allways true. When I contacted Palm about this issue I recieved a less than satisfactory reponse - ""I'm sorry but we don't offer technical help for our beta drivers"". This was not the type of response I expect to recieve - I'm returning the products if they don't support them I won't use them."
3,A good little product,"i give it 3.5 stars.i like this little gadget b/c it's small, stylish and makes my life more organized. in retrospect, i wish that i did not spend so much on this palm because an average user like myself could never take full advantage of all its features. i use it just to keep phone numbers and appointments.my one major complaint is that the buttons on the bottom are falling apart. one of them (the datebook one) stopped working all together. i never dropped my palm and it is always in its leather protective case.i feel that it is a great product, but before you buy, seriously think about how you plan on using it, you may not need to spend so much $$$ on all those memory."
1,Junk,"I don't know what possessed me to ever buy this. Even for just light use as as a calander, and even for the cheap price, it is completely worthless. Technology has come a LONG way since this relic!"
5,Palm,"Works just fine; updated from my old records on my computer. The vendor was excellent and most helpful. My old Palm had ""died"" and I really missed it. This one fits my needs and is easy to carry with me since I do not have an Iphone all my addresses and calendars are within easy reach"
4,Lasted a long time but got replaced by tablets,"I liked this device for a long time but gave up using it years ago. Since then I haven't used a stylus but miss that aspect. I haven't seen anybody using a Palm device in a long time and don't recommend buying one now.However, anybody that wants one of these PalmOne devices can try out a used one at a reasonable price."
2,BROKE BACK lighting,"The Palm Vx is a great little organizers for Old Palm users that loved writing with a stylus. Its old black and white display is easy on the eyes and now easy on the pocket.Problem: This series is so old that the serial port (DB9) is NO LONGER the same serial port on modern day computers. This means you would have to either sync your info through infrared, purchase an adapter or NEVER LET IT RUN OUT OF POWER. If you do the whole memory is erased. Also the guy who sold it to me forgot to mention that the backlighting option (which btw is the ONLY THING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE SCREEN AT NIGHT) was not working."
1,Unreliable,"The on and off switch stopped working after a few months, after sending it back for repairs, I received a refurbished Palm with a defective button. This caused a crash with all data lost. Sent back again. This time the graffiti area was incorrectly positioned. Back again - I finally received a new model. After a few months the power button stopped working. At this point I have given up. A waste of money. I won't even go into the hot sync problems."
2,Less for more,"I have reviewed the Vx vs the Handspring Visor Deluxe and have seen them both in operation. Sure the Handspring is a little larger, BUT the $200 price difference is better! Handspring also has a toll free number for support.Plus the upcoming products that will be available show that they are looking at the future! 3Com, look over your shoulder, there IS competition!"
2,Not up to snuff compatibility-wise,"It's all about what they fail to tell you . . . The Palm Vx is not compatible, thus not supported by 3COMM, with Windows ME. PalmPilot/3COM says to keep checking back with the Web site to see when it is compatible/supported. Not in this lifetime buster! I have better things to do than checking Palm's Web page every few days to find out when their product will be usable.This buyer returned the product and purchased the equivilant Handspring Visor Prism, which as it turns out, is not only compaitble, but offers color and many add-ons the Palm Vx doesn't offer for $49.00 more.I am NOT a Handspring employee or stock holder"
4,Pleasantly surprised...,"I was secretly hoping to receive a a Handspring Visor Platinum for Christmas, but received a Palm Vx instead. I have been very happy with my Palm. It's worked wonderfully. It's also nice to not have to worry about batteries, though I'm still learning to leave it in the charger regularly. One gripe -- everyone (including all of the store sales people) seems to think that Palms come with USB cradles. They don't and apparently you can't buy one. You have to spend an extra $40 to get a USB connecter. If Handspring can master the USB cradle, I don't see why Palm's not including them (except as a potential money making extra)."
5,Sweet,"The Vx is very light, ideal for school. I use it for school, it is small and light to fit in my pocket. The Vx has tons of memory, and games play great. This palm is well worth it's price."
3,Disappointing,"I bought the Palm Vx about 15 months ago, and since then I have lost the screen constantly and kept having to digitize. However, the screen has now gone so far off the top that I can not get to the digitizer menu. I am now stuck with this situation and cannot enter any new data, or access certain menus. I am very disappointed, with the Palm, and it is also too heavy and too big to carry around with you."
5,Love at first glance!,"it's a really cool & sleek gadget, and, moreover, it works very well! I sync my Vx with my offive's Outlook97 in a very seamless way, and that was my biggest concern befor buying the thing (well acrually I wasn't concerned about the Palm, but you know the other side...). So it's four months I use the thing and I can't remember the littlest problem, it ever survived two big drops with only minor scratches on its silverish body. The battery life is good and the fact they are rechargeable isn't a little advantage on some competitors. Now I expect Palm Computing or somebody else to design a GSM add-on, a device with the same form factor of the modem byut that gives the Vx the functionality of a GSM cell phone. In my opinion this could be another killer app for the Palm."
1,"Good Product, Lousy Support","Palm has created a fantastic software platform and a very good hardware product. But if I had it to do over again, I'd buy a Handspring. Macintosh integration seems like an afterthought. For instance, you have to buy the desktop software separately, whereas the Windows software comes with the handheld; and if you're an iMac user, you have to pay another fifty bucks for a bug-ridden USB adapter which I still haven't managed to get working).Palm goes out of its way to avoid helping users. I spent about two months pursuing an e-mail thread with Technical Support, which ultimately advised me that they couldn't help me ""due to the technical nature of [my] inquiry."" And if you want to talk to a human being, you'll be spending an hour or so on hold -- on your long distance bill, not theirs.My Handspring friends seem much more satisfied."
3,Excellent product but ....,"... I wish that I had purchased a Handspring Visor instead.I agree with all the positive comments that the other reviewer make regarding this unit. The unit is robust (helpful if you drop it), convenient (fits nicely into your pocket), has easy to use software and comes with enough memory that you can download a lot of mail to read offline.However, it is just too expensive when compared to other handheld units. You can get all these great features on a Visor for half the price. In addition, the handspring comes with cheaper, more interesting plug in cards.The biggest advantage of the palm Vx over the handspring is that is much ""sexier"". Smaller and more streamlined than the Palm III style Visor.The Palm Vx is convenient, stylish and powerful. Too bad it is overpriced."
3,not the best if you travel a lot,"For travellers there is no better alternative than regular batteries. The Visor Platinum runs on 2 AAA batteries that last for weeks. And when you need new ones, you can buy them in any corner store. Nothing to carry, nothing to plug in and no worries. Imagine if you leave for your trip and later discover you forgot the charger! In the end, the Vx is overpriced. The unit costs $400 and if you need the travel kit that's $50 more. The Visor Platinum has a faster processor, it is $100 cheaper and you don't need any adapters or chargers when travelling. Visor also offers a 56k modem that is cheaper than Palm's 33k [and Palm does not have a 56k model available at this time]. Hmm. By the way, I don't work for Visor; I own a Vx but wish I had the Visor my girlfriend has. We'll take hers when we go overseas next month..."
5,Palm has done it again!,This handheld is made with great quality! I myself had a Palm M105 which has very similar stats. The Palm Vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome! I would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or work!
5,My PalmVx seems like it was made for my Mac!,"I recently purchased a Palm Vx, my first foray into handhelds. It was extremely easy to learn to use, and the software seems very logical... so far there haven't been any ""oh, I wish it would..."" and I have yet to consult the documentation, it's so straight-forward. Best of all, it's as though it was made for my Mac, instead of made for a PC and then translated. No more stray pieces of paper and thick datebooks for me. I also have 3 technical books loaded on it that I refer to several times each day at work."
2,Crashed three times,"I don't see why this item is getting good reviews. It's crashed three times, losing everything. Now the battery won't completely charge. I never could get it connected to the computer. Makes me wonder about Palm."
1,no recharger,"Upon receiving the palmone, I noticed there was no recharger. Since then I have been trying to purchase one in my country, but was told that this is an old model and they don't sell such rechargers. (I had to pay a more for the delivery than for the palmone, so I didn't want to order one through amazon). So, I can't even turn on the palmone..."
3,outdated technology,The product works as stated.Whether it's productive to use will have to be determined. Reason for purchase was to have something inexpensive to use instead of a laptop computer when on the road.
4,Good PDA,This Palm replaced my original one that was stolen. It works great but I am ready to uprade to the new Palm Tungsten PDA.
5,Don't look further,"All the possibilities are described above, so I won't repeat them. I'll tell you just my feelings on this pretty little thing called Palm. From the moment I first held (someone else's-) Palm V in my hand I was sold. Love at first sight is the proper terminology. Basically that's the first aspect I love about it. The shape and weight of this little device. Furthermore I chose this over for example keyboard based PDA's (like Psion etc) because I can make entries without having to make room on a desk, if there is one available that is. The handwriting recognition works well, and the user interface is very well thought out. Even a chaotic like myself can easily find anything on this machine, and it's fun to sort you r programs adresses etc. Just ask someone you know if you can just hold it and you'll soon find yourself about 400 USD lighter..."
3,What's the next step?,"I have used a Palm V since they where out in the market. Now I just bought a HP Jornada 458 and been wondering when we are going to have a device so powerful and nice looking as those powered with pocket pc.I'm not talking about the color, I'm talking on a device that can hold mission critical applications and tools for developing professional modules that can interact with bar code readers, gps, and RadioFrecuency data interchange.This keeps Palm's ""??"" in the ""what's going on with you?"" apparel.I must recognize that Palm Vx size it amasing and very convenient if you like to carry it on your shirt pocket"
1,What a disappointment,"I recently got a Vx and what a disappointment! It is not upgradable. The recharger is expensive if you want one at the office. There is no backup, so if the battery goes dead you lose all your data. It comes with bare bones software and the add-ons are expensive. I quickly used up the 8 MB of memory and now I have to discard this one and buy something that better suits my needs. Don't waste your money on this one. Other brands have more to offer."
2,Shock for lack of disclosure,I don't appreciate at all the fact that it was NOT disclosed before the purchase that the product was made in China. I thought it was made here.I will not order ANYMORE from Amazon because of this.
5,Availibility,"May I know when is the next availibility of this product? As far as I am concern, this product is currently out of stock. Could you provide me with more info on its availibility thru the web site as well.Thanks"
3,The jury is out,"OK, so I admit to being a bit of a loser when it comes tolearning these gadgets, but so far I haven't understood why I needed to buy this thing. I had a HUGE amount of problems trying to import my 400 contacts from Microsoft Outlook (nothing matched up and it took me 5 hours of editing to get SOME similarities between the two lists), then I accidentally deleted all the email from my home computer, and I am deathly afraid of bringing my Intellisync into the office and trying to do similar damage here. WHAT DOES THIS THING DO? (I know... RTFM... something I am NOT good at)So far, I haven't figured out what the thing is supposed to do. I guess it does what I tell it to do, but at this point, I am ready to make it a [paperweight].Oh yeah, there is some Solitaire game that I can play, except I have no moves left and I can't figure out how to reset it and play a new game. Fun.Flames and helpful hints to: mdnathan@yahoo.com"
3,Wrong Audience,"One thing that I love about my 8 yr old daughter is the fact that she still loves to play with doll babies. So when she saw this book in her school library, it seemed to be right up her alley. When I saw her reading the book, it seemed innocent enough at a glance. But when I actually looked at the cover illustration and then read the page she was reading, I was shocked. This is not a book that I believe is appropriate for an 8 year old or any other kid in elementary school. Maybe it's a good story and maybe it's well written but the targeted audience is all wrong. I'd like to preserve the innocence of my child for as long as possible. I believe this book's audience should be those who are at least 13 years or older. Of course there are scenarios in life when it may be warranted to have this conversation with a younger child. I don't deny that. But that should at least be at the parents discretion. That's my 2 cents. I hope this is helpful."
2,Kiosk Rating <1,"Seems to be three storylines very tenuously overlapping while occupying most of the movie. First, there's the one about some civil unrest in Thailand which seemed very docudrama like and was boringly distracting. Second, was an unexplained (probably the director felt it was too dumb to try) of a young girl that is part dog/part human (sure). Third, were some Chinese vacationers somewhere in between those storylines. Mostly you just see the vacationers doing typical dumb touristy things which goes on for over half the movie but interspersed with the docudrama of the sign waving civil unrest and dog/girl running around on all fours. Finally the dead mother of dog/girl shows up as a spirit and her body is later found floating in a tank of some liquid. Dog girl dies - end of story.I watched the movie a second time and have decided that the dog/girl story was creative/different enough and coupled with a few decent, although inexpensive, effects makes the movie worthy of another star."
2,Disappointed,"After all the raves and hype I expected something grand from this book and was sorely disappointed. Acclaimed as ""highly readable"", the book is, I contend, just the opposite. Paragraphs addressing concepts are suddenly interrupted by very specific lists of names of ancient people, and the like, so that rather than being an introduction, the book is a review medium for those who already know about what they are reading. Like most overview courses in college, ""overview"" is better for those who know the details and want now to draw them together. A true introduction would not overwhelm the reader with arcane material which slows down the process of thinking about the subject. I agree with the critic who said he could only cover about 5 pages at a time. Really slow going and jarring in its mixture of readable and arcane."
3,"Extremely informative, but perhaps too much so?","This book is jam packed with historical information relating to theology from the very beginning of mankind. I found it interesting, but just a bit too jam-packed for me. It is tough to keep it all straight, and I kept hoping the author would liven it up a little. It is, however, a truly marvelous study of the religions of the world, their origin, their history, and their evolution as the needs of man changed. A very fascinating subject that the author does extrememly well with. If you are a student of world religions, you will find this book invaluable. If you are looking for a light, entertaining read, perhaps it is better to look elsewhere."
4,FASTER than DOC Holiday,Haven't had an opportunity to read this one yet...It's the only entree and I'm the only one at the table!!
1,Incredibly boring,"This book was so dry and boring I have to admit I did not read the whole thing, it was torturous."
2,not very good...,A reader from New Englandur right onI was looking forward to this book.What a waste!
2,Classic Textbook,"This is a college textbook:1-It is dry, lengthy and extremely boring to read. The author goes into obscure detail without creating any sense of coherency or direction.2-Laypeople who are generally interested in seeking God would be lulled to sleep by the first paragraph, in effect shutting down their interest.3-The author (Armstrong) gives the facade of being an unbiased historical scholar, never directly presenting her own beliefs, while passive aggressively promoting her own view of atheism.Armstrong is generally respectful in her presentation of world religion but is highly critical of Judaism and Christianit. Islam is pictured as a revolutionary faith that bravely overcame Jewish oppression for survival. The reality that Muhammad spread Islam largely through violence and bloodshed is neatly omitted in this work.If you are a layperson like me, seeking to learn more about God, find another book and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE."
2,A mystical approach,"Armstrong purports ot write an extensive treatment of monotheism. She writes from a mystical point of view and is opposed to logic and rationality. The book contains unfortunately many speculations that have long been refuted by archaeologists or scholars and that Armnstrong seem to have picked up in old books. An example of this is Armstrong take-over of the documentary hypothesis about the Thorah (The books of Archer, Gleason provide a good treatment of this subject.)."
3,Good treatment of a sensitive subject,I enjoyed the book because it gave a scholarly treatment to what is a very emotionally charged subject.
2,Interesting but biased,"I have just finished this book and Jerusalem and found both to be interesting but biased. I cannot attest to whether Ms. Armstrong's ""facts"" are accurate or not but I can state that she has an extreme bias in favor of Islam and against Christianity and Judaism. Her language glosses over the barbaric acts of Muslims while highlighting the barbaric acts of Christians and Jews. Her tone and implication is that Islam has been beneficient and Christianity and Judaism have been hateful, especially Christianity."
3,Solid work that is unfortunately undermined by bias,"Karen Armstrong's most famous book, ""A History of God"", is a very substantive book that has many merits that are unfortunately dragged down by Karen's anti-West bias. Don't get me wrong; some of the chapters in Armstrong's book are very captivating and informative, but her obvious anti-West bias that creeps up time and time again definitely degrades the substance of Armstrong's book. Also, she sometimes makes sweeping claims that are not backed up by convincing evidence. For example, Armstrong repeatedly makes the claim that many of the stories in the Hebrew Bible were not meant to be taken seriously, even though she provided very weak evidence to support this view. Overall, this books is definitely worth reading for those interested in religious studies, despite a couple of the aforementioned flaws.A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam"
2,Beautiful Work Without Depht,"This isn't so much a history of God as much as Armstrong's view of a history of God. Parts of it is beautifully written and she is honest enough about the intolerance and cruelty that has been an unflattering part of the Abrahamic faiths. However, her sources remain dated and in dealing with Christianity, a lot seems lost in her translation of Christ from a divine figure into a historical person and she seems oblivious that any of her statements may seem controversial. I certainly do not feel I have learned anything about the Protestant view of God (or maybe the God of the Protestants) from reading this work. Then there are the little things, like her reference to Origen castrating himself which she takes at face value even though it comes from the writings of Eusebius who had his own theological ax to grind."
4,Interesting for believers and non-believers.,"This is not a quick read, but it is very thought provoking. It crystallized my thinking about God and religion. I am very glad that I spent the time to read and think about what she has written, and I highly recommend this book. While the book is about the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism are also mentioned."
5,History of God,"If someone wants to understand the history and connection of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, this is a must read. Simply written for easy understanding. Educational and entertaining. Highly recommend."
5,Can't imagine being any better if done in the first person,"A rare combination of extensive research and a capitivating narration by the author. Audiotape listeners are often put off by the quality of the narration. The author, Karen Armstrong, is a former Roman Catholic nun, with a British accent comparable to Julie Andrews. I have put off reading her book for several years and consumed the tape in a week. I'm now inspired to read the book to fill in the gaps. This is the finest historical audiotape both for content and narration."
5,A gift that was very well received,I bought this as a gift to a family member who wanted to read it and he has informed me that the book is excellent. I cannot be more specific as I have not read personally.
3,A History of God,"Highly informative but with gaps that readers without the needed background would not recognize. Her biases, expressed in subtle, perhaps unintended ways, pervade her interpretations. I would recommend it only for discriminating readers."
3,Great begining but it looses it's purpose,"This is a wonderful book for those people, such as myself, who have always wondered how the God of the Old Testament came to be. I was awe-struck at the detail that Ms. Armstrong presents and the masterful way in which she weaves the tale of the birth and coming of age of the God of Abraham. Then, at the half-way point, it becomes a book on Islam, which is her specific area of expertise and interest. As the chapters went by, I lost interest because we were no longer discussing God but Muslim theology."
4,A true work of scholarship,"This scholarly book traces the cultural and philosophical evolution of the human conception of God surrounding the 3 major monotheistic faiths. Armstrong explains the common lineage, the similarities and the variance of the conceptual understandings of God that shape people's lives...for better or for worse. This book is best understood if you have a little bit of background in religious and world history and it does require concentration. I particularly enjoyed this audio version because I could listen to certain chapters a second time. However, the audio book is abridged. This book encourages people to understand that no single person, group, or religious tradition has a monopoly of truth. It also calls people to learn about history to avoid the tragic consequences of claiming human agendas as the will of God."
4,A Nice Overview,"Karen Armstrong is able to weave together the complex history of monotheism in a readable narrative. The timing of historical events, juxtaposed to events in the eastern religions and the Bible, give the reader a broad perspective from which to understand how one's own personal understanding of God may have originated. Interestingly, the ""Intelligent Design"" idea, was one of five ""proofs"" of the existence of God 400 years ago- it had nothing to do with science or the origin of man. One small drawback is the long theoretical analysis of some aspects of early Christianity - important, but difficult to follow. I highly recommend it."
1,superficial and misleading,"Ms. Armstrong has done a poor job of relaying the essence of the three great monotheistic religions. She is terribly biased against Christianity and her narrative reveals a superficial understanding of biblical and church history and well as theology and philosophy. This reviewer would recommend reading either Jaraslov Pelikan's ""The Christian Tradition"" or J.N.D. Kelly's ""Early Christian Doctrine's"" to get a more accurate and insightful appreciation of the development of Christian ideas and doctrines. Since, I am less schooled in Jewish and Muslim traditions, I cannot recommend a good source, however, I'm sure that there are many better books on those traditions than what Ms. Armstrong presents."
1,More Like a History of Atheism,"Of the 8 sides to the cassettes, one side would suffice to consolidate the beneficial information about the 4,000 Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.The remaining portions of the tapes are filled opinionated speculation, cynical views of Christianity, and a quest for the ""ideal"" of Atheism.It is not until the final dissertation on the last side of the last tape that the listener finds out that the author had a bad experience with ""religion"" as a child."
1,Unreadable,"This book succeeds only in proving that the author has a scholar's understanding of the historical underpinnings of monotheism. As a means of educating those of us who lack a formal education in theology, the book is a soulless, meandering failure. Whoever reviewed this book for the NYT and described it as witty and compelling had either not read it, was a close friend of the author, or both."
3,An Scholarly book,"I could read this great book in a few weeks. This is something very scholarly and deep researched. The author worked as a nun in one Church, this is the beauty of this work. She was listening the text of the Bible every time she was awake. She could enlighten herself enough to write such a book is amazing.Despite her religious background Karen has written a comprehensive account of the history of religions. This must be taught to the graduation level students of history and English in place of fictions.This book is a deep insight therefore need readers' full attention to understand."
3,"not bad, but a few issues","I take issue with some of what she says about the Hebrew people. While exploring the backgrounds and historical origins of their faith, she presents a version of the Exodus which is respected and developed, but is only 1 of several academically relevant approaches. Also, her stating that Abraham would have thought ""Yahweh"" was the Canaanite god ""El"" is a little unclear...yes Abram didn't know ""Yahweh"" by name per-se, but knowing God as ""El"" isn't necessarily proper as ""El"" was a generic term for ""a god"" and didn't necessarily point to the particular god ""El"".There is a lot of information presented; most of it is solid stuff, but a few under-developments leave me with protest in areas."
3,"Thorough, but biased","This book really captured my attention at first. The first chapter is very informative. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. The author presents the facts, but she can't leave her opinion out of them. It's quite obvious that she is resentful of the religious life she abandoned. While there is no doubt that religion has its dark side, this book is not supposed to be an expose. As a history of the idea of God, it's at its finest when it sticks to the well-researched facts. When the author gets didactic and starts to editorialize, it just gets annoying."
5,Holy moly,"Karen Armstrong has really created a must-have masterpiece with this book. Whether your yourself are Jewish, Christian,Islamic, or none of the above... it's impossible to deny the impact these religions have had on the modern world. This book carefully examines the origins of these three major religions and looks at what they've evolved into today.It's a very informative book for people of all faiths that really sticks to the facts and never once becomes preachy."
3,An okay book,This is not a serious book. The author is clearly biased and has her own interpretations of the Gods of every religion.I don't recommend buying this book if your are a serious reader of the History of religions.
2,unenlightened,"While Ms Armstrong is very well researched on Christian and Moslem beliefs and customs, her understanding of Judaism was not as strong and it was quite apparent in my read thru. Ms Armstrong presents an out dated view of Judaism with a revengeful and jealous G-d. She would be best served by visiting an Aish Hatorah web site the next time she chooses to write about this subject."
1,good idea wrong auth,"please contact me if you really want a page by page breakdown, Karen just is not educated enough to write this book. She comes off as a disgruntled Nun which she actually is. every other page represents a outdated theory, popular when she wrote the book as the mainstream consensus. Also the entire thing is a work of Teleological tunnel vision and is ridden with anachronism. If you wish to learn more about religion consult authors like Pagels and Pelikan, doctors and eminent scholars in their fields. I do not give this book a one lightly!"
2,Not sure about this one,"This is a very popular book, which is sad because it's highly biased. She provides evidence, but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story.Christian study maybe, Christian fact, VERY loosely."
3,A bit dense and rather biased,"This book seems to basically accomplish what it sets out to, but not without some yawns and doubts in the author's objectivety from the reader. The book is filled with detail and information, but the reader is left to figure out the distinction between the major characters and facts and the more minor.Perhaps a bigger concern is that the author seems very biased at certain points. She is rather negative towards Christianity (at least the later versions) and oddly positive towards Islam.But, if the reader can filter out all the opinion, and get through the dense areas, there is a lot to be learned here."
1,Historian? Or creative manipulator,"This book is okay for a broad view of how religions developed; the problem comes when you focus in on the details. If you are detailed oriented, then I hope you really know your religious history because if not, you will not be aware of her inclination to misrepresent, omit crucial facts, and make statements that are not referenced. Also, do not expect an unbiased scholarly text, her disdain for Christianity and her empathy for Islam is very apparent. Ms. Armstrong seems to have an agenda that is cloaked in ""historical"" writing. My impression of this book echoes criticism of her previous works from actual historians. Just because she is popular does not make her accurate, and this book is just yet another example that she is not a trained historian, merely an avid reader who can write.I would recommend reading the customer review of zenoofelia who details Armstrong's lack of factual knowledge. Thank you zenoofelia for an excellent review."
2,PC and deprecating,"A conscientious survey obviously based on committed and extensive study, but marred throughout by the author's predilection for the politically correct and the related deprecation of her own culture and society, and by an apparent absence of direct personal experience in her chosen subject."
1,"glad this ""a"" history of god","Because if it were ""the"" history, I would call this author a liar. This is a biased work against ""western"" Christianity and seeks more to draw you to Armstrong's idea that man is god."
2,Not what I hoped for.,"Ms. Armstrong (a former nun) seems to have done her homework on on the history of western religion, the book is filled with a lot of obscure detail. But I found it fairly difficult to read and rather dry.I think my problem with it is that I was hoping for an exciting story about the the history of god/religion....but the book just doesn't tell a great story. Felt more like something I'd be required to read for a college class."
3,"Interesting, but a bit biased",The author certainly has done her research and puts it together quite well. Most of the book is really about Islam and the first five books of the Jewish/Christian Bible. The comments regarding the bias to Islam and the lack of information regarding Paul are justified. I wish that the author would have provided a more compelling reason for her conclusion on the path she saw of most benefit - rather than simply providing a biased justification by way of eliminating the other paths by way of her displeasure with them.Some interesting information gleaned from the book was how enlightened you will be as to how many dead-ends you can encounter when discussing/debating religion. Some issues are simply a matter of faith.
5,Insightful and Objective,A wonderful book that gave me a greater understanding of the evolution of religion. A must read for serious questioners of theology.
4,Gift,It was a gift for a friend who was doing research while working on a movie script. He was happy with it.
4,Excellent Read,"Karen Armstrong is an excellent writer and has done a lot of research. I feel as though I learned a great deal about the Bible and religious beliefs. This book also explains, in part, some important current issues facing us in today’s world."
3,Not bad,If it haden't been too long it would be more helpful in having a good overview of the intricacies that people have put into the simple idea of deifying a supreme authority.
4,Nice overview how belief in a higher being has evolved.,"You have to be open minded about the author's perspective.It was nice to see that someone who was in the Catholic Church took it upon themselves to look at the origin of God and how this perception changed over time for the three major religions disccuss, Judiasm, Islam and Catholocism."
1,Boo,"Before taking an abstract algebra course this semester I studied the material on my own using the introductory texts by Gallian and Hungerford. These books were very useful because they actually completed proofs instead of leaving them as exercises for the reader. Someone new to abstract algebra is also typically new to higher mathematics. This means a book should have clear and full explanations, not skip major points like Rotman does. Rotman commits another sin by failing to provide homework problems which correspond with the material he presents. One nice thing is that the book does provide a wide array of material (much more than most other introductory texts). This virtue soon turns astray however because by providing so much preliminary material on congruences, functions, divisibility, .... you'll be lucky if your teacher gets to groups by halfway through the semester."
3,no better than the first edition,"It is always easy to add something to than to get rid of something from the book. I guess this is the case of the author when he prepares the second edition. However, I prefer the first edition because it is more readable, enjoyable, and most importantly, contains just enough information for the introduction to abstract algebra. There are huge number of textbooks on abstract algbra, and making another would not be the author's purpose of the revision, I hope, but it looks it is.By adding more subjects in detail to the second edition, now it looks the same as any other, only to loose its expository and conversational style of writings, and became a reference-style textbook."
3,Problem,"I really can't review this because I bought it inerror. While my son loves Tritt, he already had thealbum and I didn't know it."
2,Strong Enough,"I love this song. And, I was soooo impressed when I heard Travis Tritt explaining how he felt after hearing Sheryl Crow sing her song ""Strong Enough..."" I love this song as a response to hers. It is really cool."
5,For Joe Six pack,"I really liked this CD.Freedom of speech is a two-way street. If the Chicks say something like they did, not everybody has to like it."
2,+1/2 Kinda overblown.,"It's pretty telling that Travis Tritt, who did his best to lead the Nashville backlash against the Dixie Chicks (for daring to --gasp!! -- have an opinion that wasn't the same as his!), starts this album off with a song about how his career isn't over, and he isn't all washed up (""You Can't Count Me Out Yet""). It's also interesting that he follows it up with a song about a guy who's a big ole stubborn butthead, ""Can't Tell Me Nothin'."" Yeah, I guess if I was a country superstar who had as much trouble holding a melody and writing or picking a good song as Tritt does, I'd probably go after the Dixie Chicks, too -- less competition on the charts, if you're lucky. Hey Travis: if you don't like freedom of speech, why don't you move to Singapore or Saudi Arabia, where they don't have any? America... love it or leave it alone, dude."
2,Mixed Feelings,"Listen: a lot of really smart people really like this, so you'll probably have to see for yourself. And I found it beautifully made, visually very disciplined, restrained and impressively minimalist. That said, I was ultimately underwhelmed. It was lugubrious. It was maudlin. Pleasure at the novelty of following Ware's unique visual grammar was overshadowed by the general leadenness of the story, characters, worldview. The theme of ""Child is the Father of the Man"" and insights about alienation across generational lines were ultimately too banal to sustain such a long work. I really, really wanted to like this. It came recommended by people whose views I have a lot of reverence for. It just wasn't my cup of tea."
5,Getting to Know the Weird Shut-In Down the Road,"You'll probably find yourself having more in common with Jimmy than you would like to admit. I certainly did, and I was surprised just how emotionally I identified with this poor, fictional sadsack. The clean, boldly delineated artwork perfectly conveys how cool, texture-free, and unwelcoming the world must appear through the eyes of sweet, simple Jimmy. He has grown-up fatherless ( like too many have these days ) and is frightened of nearly everything. Yet he is likable, despite his pathological bashfulness, and I found myself rooting for him to achieve...anything at all. When it looks like he may be in serious trouble late in the story, I was shocked at just how strongly those few small panels moved me! A great work of art by Chris Ware and I can't recommend this enough."
3,The most depressing piece of writing ever,"What we have here is comic that tries to be more than just abstracted kiddy characters - it tries to reach the level of literature. I think it comes pretty close, but with one major shortfall. This is one of the most depressing pieces of writing I have ever read.I can't even use words like ""dark"" and ""brooding"" to describe it, because the story is so incredibly ordinary. And it isn't sad in the sense that you want to cry or anything. You read it and hope to G-d that you're going to be nothing like this guy. You see, it's the story of a lonely, loveless, pathetic guy who needs to call his mom everyday... Man! Even thinking about it makes me feel depressed... Buy this book to find out what I mean."
3,wth,"i am extremely displeased with this product. it was brand new when i received it, and i started reading it for my american novel class. but as i was reading, the binding began to tear until finally the whole cover came off! the binding for this book is just too depressing and embarrassing to be associated with this wonderful graphic novel."
3,"Not bad. But not great, either.","Being serious and depressiong doesn't always equal BRILLIANT, as some people think. It was a good tale though, just not great, and I finished it with a shrug of my shoulders. I was disappointed with the main character's lack of dialogue---some might see this as indication of ""character,"" but I only saw it as a detriment. But still, not that I minded the story being a downer. Just a week earlier I read ""Ghost World,"" and was much more moved by that..."
2,"Decent art, abysmal story and characters","The art is interesting, in a retro style. The architectural drawings are the best part of the book, but the drawings of the characters are extremely simplistic and uninteresting.The story is where this completely falls apart. The main characters are losers, in every sense of the word. I'm not joking when I say that the main thing Jimmy says is ""Uh"". He's completely pathetic and I had absolutely no sympathy for him or anyone else in this book.The pace of this book is absolutely ridiculous, too. ""Slow"" doesn't even scratch the surface - this is pure tedium.It's all hype. There are so many great graphic novels out there - skip this and find something decent like ""Watchmen""."
1,I don't get it,"I'm not talking about the artwork, everyone knows that is beautiful.I just don't understand where is the pleasure of this book. It's depressing, sad and boring."
5,Amazing,"It is one thing to write a wonderful book. It is another to write one that is probably the best in its genre. But it is an entirely different accomplishment when your book can validate the literary merits of said genre, and that is what Jimmy Corrigan does.Ware's drawing is astounding and the story indescribably brilliant. No need for synthesis in this review, suffice to say that Ware had a brilliant story and then used the graphic novel to do things that could never be done in a conventional novel. Each page brings a new surprise. I was never a fan of comic books, but this book is so spectacular that it clearly stands out as the gold standard for graphic novels."
4,"Heartbreaking, But Riveting",This is such a great read that is heartbreaking in many ways. The illustration work is stunning and the story is powerful.
5,Better than Maus.,"Can't help but agree with pretty much everything that's said here. This is truly amazing -- i got it on a whim having only seen a couple of the strips-- and was blown away by the whole saga.I am rarely this affected by any work of art, and have never been so transported by any graphic novel, including Maus. Ware's illustrations are brilliant in their simplicity, conveying the emotional pain of awkwardness and loneliness more effectively than any novel I've read. The way he breaks up a page, elongating quick, important moments and compressing vast expanses of time reflects the way we live and perceive our own existences.I can't say enough good things about this book. If you're interested enough to read these reviews, you can't go wrong in getting this book."
5,Amazing,"Possibly the greatest graphic novel yet, Chris Ware has taken the art form to new levels in every way. The story is very engrossing and smart, but the way Chris Ware tells it, it also makes you stop and just admire his visual contructs, page layouts, and artwork. If you get confused, he even has summaries to tell you what has occured so far. He's a genius."
3,"Enjoyable, overrated","I really enjoyed this, but have some points of contention. This ranked #5 of Wizard magazine's top graphic novels and while it's very good, for me it didn't live up to expectations and it does take awhile for the book to find it's groove.There are some laugh out loud parts to this book, some really outstanding emotional moments as well, but at 380 pages, it wasn't an easy read for the 1st half of the book. Jimmy Corrigan is neurotic, nervous, depressed and fairly annoying, but this odd catharsis of a story wins you over with a meticulous anecdotal history of the family and some outrageously funny fantasies.The art is damn annoying; the pages are crammed with too many panels and the seemingly simple, but detailed style can be quite distracting. Many pages have arrows directing you from panel to panel and that's usually a bad sign.I didn't like the ending either, but, hey, I'm glad I read it."
1,Hugely Disappointing!,"Why are there so many positive reviews? The story is very bland and extremely depressing. Nothing profound to be found here.The illustrations are quite good, but this cannot hold the viewers attention through the meaningless events contained.Not recommended, unless you want to feel depressed after reading this story."
1,"Sad, depressing, emotional outlet for...someone","The book is beautifully designed and drawn. And, techniques of film are used successfully to tell the story through 'thought bubble' equivalents, and flashbacks. But, in the end, the story is just sad, does not redeem itself, and doesn't leave you with any significant insights. For this, I see this work as simply the venting or emotional outlet for the author, either actual or imagined. Not too different from Woody Allen's simply using his art as an outlet for his neuroses (with a very few exceptions).My kids were picking up this book, attracted to the colorful images, so I threw it in the garbage. I couldn't think of anyone who I would want to share this with, and certainly didn't want my kids looking at it. I truly hope this is not the experiences of the author, relived through this sad and abused character."
1,Jimmy Corrigan: Suckiest Comic on Earth,"I usually LOVE graphic novels, and I was really excited after I heard all the great reviews for this book.Then I read it, and it was awful. Really Awful. And it wasn't one of those things where I'm not smart enough to understand it. I get it, I understand what he is trying to say, and I've seen a lot of great graphic story telling. It was interesting, to see the artwork, but the story was awful and the characters were completely unlikable.This book is not worth the time it takes to read it, and is ultimately diappointing. There are so many great books out there, don't waste your time with this, read something else, like ""Lost at Sea""."
2,Great story bad binding,I really like the story but the binding was terrible. Should have saved my money and bought it cheaper somewhere else. I like to collect good books like these but I guess I'll have to be more careful with my purchases...
3,Sad!,"Very strangely, there are similarities between this book's storyline and Barak Obama's Dreams of my Father: a short, not particularly fruitful meeting between a son and the father he had never met, a black child brought up in a white family who ends up with a white sibling, Chicago as a set for major scenes.The outcome is however completely different in that Jimmy Corrigan, certainly NOT the smartest kid on earth, is incapable all the way to the end of the book of any accomplishment whatsoever, neither personal nor professional. Overall, this makes for a very sad work, enlightened only with the author's occasional rye humour.The graphics are pared down, except for buildings which are very realistically detailed. In particular, the images of the 1893 Chicago World Fair are simply breathtaking. This is a bonus for anyone interested in that city's architecture or urban design.This however is not enough for me to recommend giving this book high priority on any reading list."
3,Hard to follow,"Seems to operate on a parallel-universe multilinearity. I couldn't follow it at all. Also, the look of it requires an acquired taste. Perhaps that's not being fair, because I did end up liking the look of it. That all said, it does read like a novel, and manage to evoke pathos."
5,brilliance and despair,the chronic pain of everyday life is presented with incredible precision and the subtle touch of humor. i highly recommend it to everyone.
5,"Amazing, lifting, and magnificent","Ware does an amazing job of creating one of the most moving graphic novels I have ever read. The painstakingly detailed drawings add an unparalleled scope to this novel following the meek Jimmy Corrigan, as well as the 1893 story arc following his equally downtrodden grandfather of the same name. The dream tangents are vivid and beautiful, and only occasionally introduced before hand (""I allowed myself to luxoriate in one of my favorite semi-conscious conceits""). Do yourselves a favor and READ THIS NOVEL RIGHT NOW!"
3,"Nice size, paper","It can be difficult to read the title of this book by looking at the front cover (you might not have picked it out in a real bookstore), but it is not unattractive. The dust jacket is functional, both as a dust jacket and a cut-out paper doll.Without the dust jacket, the book feels cheap, for a hardcover, but it is stately and a bit more scrutable than the dust jacket. The spine on mine is weak, and the binding has come loose. This is most bothersome.The paper has a good weight to it, and the ink is nicely done. There are cut-outs and activities similar to the one in the dust jacket throughout the book, as well as helpful instructions toward the most effective enjoyment of the book.Mostly, the binding at the spine seems annoyingly defective."
3,DIFFICULT TO REVIEW,"First of all, the art and design are beautiful. I'm pretty sure Ware won an award for them. And it would be difficult to get this story in the individual comics as they were published in all sorts of different sizes. Having said that, this is a DEPRESSING STORY. Do not expect to be reading the lighthearted adventures of the smartest boy on earth.Ware in his apologia gives some background on where the story came from (though I would have liked to know more) and the two page epilogue hints that maybe something nice will happen to this character but otherwise, this is a sad man with a sad life. Do not read if you are presently taking anti-depressants."
4,Good book but I rarely heard what the author thought,"This book is very in depth. If you don't come from a medical background it may be hard to understand. The author did a fantastic job referencing Wolf, Stahl and Rosen. All of which are reputable scientists but I was hoping for a new outlook into this topic. It was as if she didn't write this book from her own stand point she just put all of the previous studies that were done by other doctors on this topic in the book. I would like to know what she thinks. If I wanted to know what Doctor Wolf thought I would buy his book. From what I read this book does not provide any new insight into language based reading disabilities."
4,A Good Jazz Organ CD,I just bought this CD. It's got some nice tunes on it. He's got a guest jazz flutest on this album who is really good. It's got some swing tunes & latin rhythums & slow ballads. A nice variety of songs. I think you'll enjoy it.
3,Decent set but for beach you'll need discs,This is a decent volleyball set but if you're playing on the beach it tends to fall down. I needed to buy the Park & Sun SDK Sand Disc Kit to keep the net up.
5,Great outdoor volleyball net system!!,"I am a YMCA volleyball coach in Idaho, and had been looking for a quality outdoor net system to use for some extra practices for my team (the ""Red Hots""!). We have used the Park & Sun net several times now, and I really love it! It is easy to set up, is very solid, and looks good too! Great product, I definitely recommend it.~Coach John."
2,heaed better,"did not like this dvd and would not reccomend to anyone that is a fan of this style of music, not Carters best for sure."
4,Linda Darnell was a beauty,"and a good actress. I saw this movie years ago on a Sunday afternoon when I was a kid and loved it. Ms. Darnell was so stunning, and the story wasen't too corny. She played a simple farm girl who had big ambitions. If you can look past the men swaggering, calling each other out and the laughable ""Come here wench!"" dialogue, it's really kind of a modern woman wanting more for herself than what men think she should have and be happy with. George Sanders is at his sarcastic, snippy and sleazy best, as the king. Wish this was on DVD. Enjoy!"
2,MAKE SURE YOU READ THE BOOK!,"I recently finished the 1944 book, giving it a 5-star rating. I was intrigued when I discovered the movie. It is roughly edited and the plot is very choppy. I was glad that I had read the book prior to its viewing. There are too many characters with little to no background explanation or development(and they all look alike). The storyline is abbreviated (leaving out major segments of the book and its plot development), but you do get some idea of the culture of King Charles II's court and times, and Amber's ""Me 1st attitude"" and total self-absorption. Not worth the buy, but rental an option for a rainy day."
3,Not Wilde enough,"Gorgeous period romp and an ""over the top"" performance by George Sanders as King Charles II is marred by a lack of chemistry between Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde."
3,"Good lotion, but smells.","This lotion works really well and leaves my hands nice and soft, but it smells HORRIBLE. Orange peel is an ingredient and you can definitely smell it, but it's not a pleasant scent. More like a lingering rotten orange peel scent. I think I'll just stick with my Carmex Healing Cream."
4,Body lotion,"I have been using Curel for many years now, and I find that this particular version is the best for my needs. It is advertised as fragrance-free which I like, as I hate most of the synthetic scents that many personal products have, although it does have a very slight citrus scent which is actually rather pleasant. It works well as a body moisturizer and also as an after-shave lotion, which is really what you need instead of one of those alcohol-based after-shave lotions which only serve to dry out skin which has just been punished with a razor."
5,Wonderful account of Kenya before and at end of colonialism,"Author is more famous for ""Flame Trees of Theka."" This is her account of returning to Kenya years later, what she saw, the people she knew, both black and white Kenyans."
1,You'd be mostly wrong to buy this book.,"If there is any valuable information in this book, it is not in the first 100 pages, which was all I could bear to read. The first 100 pages were a string of anecdotes concerning notable financial advisors who made woefully bad investments, but the author, despite the title of his book, included precious little explanation of WHY they invested as they did."
1,Too outdated and confined!,"This book is basically a reminiscence of the author's stock investment experience between 1966-1969 written in 1970. Though it had been revised in 1991 with addition of, primarily, charts covering to 1990, it helped very little coz the author had only slightly revised his very descriptive, accounting report like and boring words, based mostly on history in the aforesaid 60's. I enjoy books like Reminiscenes of a Stock Operator, Baruch my own story and Gann's books much. However, this one is just so far behind the classics I mentioned above. In short, not recommended!"
4,good resource on a complicated topic,"It's hard to imagine a better or more balanced collection of essays on the topic of intelligence testing and _The Bell Curve_. The essays present various sides of the debate, featuring perspectives from psychologists, biologists, historians, and theorists. Especially illuminating were sections dealing with _TBC_'s authors' funding source, a clandestine eugenics think-tank in New York. Also, you can find some good pro-Bell Curve articles here, although the bias certainly seems to be in favour of con- (a relection, I believe, of the academic consensus_."
5,Rob sings with his eyes - this DVD is captivating,Rob does not try to be The Ratpack and imitate their style and voices but does an outstanding RW tribute. This is a fabulous DVD that is more enjoyable each time you watch it. Rob really does sing through his eyes. His eyes reflect all his emotions. He is a great artist with a great voice that one can clearly hear and appreciate on this DVD.He is also very charismatic and knows how to captivate an audience. This is also evident on the Knebworth DVD.Get this DVD -- and the CD --with all his ballads--his versatility will surprise you if all you've listened to are his pop rock songs. Besides his talent he is very sexy and has the sexiest laugh lines. Beautiful man.I can't get enough of Rob. Why not the USA? What's up with our radio stations not wanting to promote his music.
1,too bad 0 stars not available,Not a bad voice but filthy language!! Why is it necessary to swear I will never know. Didn't even make it all the way thru the dvd.
1,extraordinarily disappointing.,"i was inspired to purchase this dvd because of his performance in ""DE-LOVELY"" it didn't take long to realize that Williams is confused as to what constitutes a 'tribute' for one thing i never heard of any of the Rat Pack using foul language in front of their fans and certainly not on stage. through the entire dvd, Williams was leaping gleefully from one obscenity to another.no doubt sure that his freedom from movie direction allowed him to show us what he's really got,how wrong can one man be,he should stay in his own zone where a lacking vocabulary will never be noticed, too bad......he was great in DE-LOVELY the movie.This could have been a highly entertaining dvd...instead it misses by a mile,indeed,if he had any class he might be called arrogant as it is he's just plain sad!"
1,You will watch it just once.,"Once you watch this DVD you will never watch it again, because Mr. Williams cross the line to bad taste and unpoliteness.I think he doesn't need that. I wanted music. He doesn't seem natural, and although with a regular voice, he doesn't convince."
4,"Location, location,...bi-location","This latest installment in the continuing adventures of Jack Flanders involves the Casa Luna, a mystical coffee shop that exists simultaneously in multiple dimensions. Jack enters the cafe in New York, and steps out in the realm of the mysterious Dragon Lady, also known as the inscrutable Hispanic. Also on board are the infrit Leela, and Jack's lost uncle Lord Jowles who is not quite as Jack remembers.While not ZBS' best effort, ""Midnight at Casa Luna"" is an enjoyable listen, with a talented cast of characters. It is always nice to spend some time with Jack Flanders."
5,good movies,little house on the prairie set is the best dvd set ever. i liked watching it.it was one of my favorite movies ever.
5,little house on the prairie: the complete television series,I am a fan of little house tv series and the complete t.v. series is a must for any little house fan. This box set has all 204 episodes + all 3 movies and lots of extras. These episodes should be uncut. This is a great set to have
4,Great classic,"Very nice set of dvds, but a little disappointed in the packaging. All the dvds are in one folder, slipped into sleeves. They are difficult to get in and out, and it is easy to forget which dvd you watched last unless you look at the booklet that outlines the seasons and episodes. I felt the dvds were packaged very cheaply. One dvd had to be cleaned because it was skipping during an episode, which makes me wonder if it was a returned item. Otherwise, very happy with my purchase and looking forward to sharing this classic with my grandchildren in the future!"
1,Seems like a cool idea...,"Ok all the shows are here. The case *looks* cool. The price is better than individually buying the sesaons. However, do not get it. They are placed in small plastic baggies then put into paper sleeves. I have a few thousand DVDs and these are packaged horribly. Many had scratches (the kind that do not come out easy). Out of the 4 we tried 2 played and another one half worked. Not a good percentage. I understand why they did it this way as 9 seasons is a *lot* of DVDs. However, they fall out easy and get scratched easily on the case. I had a few come out just opening the case and they could stuck under the binder very easily.The amazon reseller was cool and refunded my money (5 stars to them!). I will be going with the individual seasons now.I should have looked at the 1 star reviews before... I am not the only one this has happened to. My wife who this was a gift for was not very happy."
5,Love Little House on The Prarie,"Love getting it all at the same time slightly discounted. Love that my kids can enjoy the shows that I enjoyed so much as a child. Only problem is my daughter would like to watch them all within a week. I won't let her, but she tries!"
5,Good clean shows for my children to watch,So excited to find this full series for such a great price. I loved this show when I was young and can't wait to share it with my boys.
2,Improper packaging,"I purchased this for my son and while I do not have time, he is enjoying it thus far.I was putting a disc away and realized three discs had slipped behind the binder and was lucky to catch this before the discs became damaged.The package is cute but added the fact that the discs also fall out while thumbing through them it seems the discs are on their way to being scratched.I will need to go buy a new disc catalog but you'd think the package would have done the trick.Expensive and stupid but important if they are to last."
4,Little House on the Prairie Complete Series,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas '08, and she loves it! The one thing that it does not include is the piolt episode. My wife was a little dissapointed with that. Other than that, this is a great product."
1,you are loosing sales,I wanted to buy this set. I will not buy this as many of the scenes are missing and episodes are missing. You really should look into getting this fixed cause a lot of people would buy this if in fact it was UNCUT AND UNEDITED. The true fans of the show will notice in a minute if something is missing. The price you are charging for this set is way to high since scenes episodes and season ten is not included. One person had a review take out the scene selections part of the dvd if this is why everything is edited If you ever get this problem fixed I will buy but not until then.What a shame
3,Owning Little House on the Prairie,I never purchased the complete series together but I do own all episodes of Little House on the Prairie on DVD. Most I purchased through Amazon. I want to say I bought them so I could watch them when I wanted and didn't have to wait for it to come on television. I am disappointed that some of the scenes are cut. How do I know because I grew up watching the show. I thought when you purchased a show on DVD that the entire episode(s) were there. I continued purchasing them anyway because there is so little to watch and like I said I wanted an episode to be available when I wanted to watch it. There seems to be so little to watch on TV anymore. Believe it or not if they reproduced the show on dvd again without any cut scenes I would probably purchase them again. I know this isn't Amazon's fault but I did want to make that comment.
2,fooled again,"Sent them back...not worth the frustration. Rate of defective episodes too high..hang ups,pixilation,audio out of sink plus low volume. Buyer beware warning on these...thoroughly shilled in reviews...you will be disappointed."
1,Please make a set worth buying,I have seen episodes from this set and when someone makes the real complete series I will gladly buy it. These are the chopped up syndicated versions. Did they lose the originals? Terrible quality. Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves.
3,NEEDS TO BE RESTORED,"This Is a good TV show and It deserves much better treatment. If the episodes were as clean and clear as the nice showcase package then I would give It 5 stars.However,I am only giving It 3 stars. I am happy to have the whole series but IT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll keep this for now but will be happy to let someone else have It when they RESTORE and release IT again!! One thing I'd like to point out Is this.......It's much cheaper to by this set than to buy the series/seasons one at a time. I had 5 seasons when I bought this,and those 5 cost me over $200 bucks! I only paid $[...] for the whole series here on amazon. This set is loaded with tons of extras,pluse 3 TV movies. I gave the 5 seasons that I paid over $200 for to my Sister-In-Law as a Christmas gift."
5,Loving Little House,"My eight year old daughter and I are really enjoying our Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series. For me, it's a walk down memory lane and it's so fun to share a part of my childood with her. She just loves the characters and the stories. They don't make family shows like this anymore."
2,Velveeta,"This show is incredibly cheesy. From Michael Landon's gigantic white teeth and razor-close shave to the sets that look like they were purchased at Home Depot, every episode is a disgrace. On the other hand, the Laura Ingalls Wilder books that this show is based on are really great. You can get the entire set of books here on Amazon for about $40: cheaper and better!"
5,My wife loves it.,"My wife always liked little house on the prairie growing up, and I liked it also. She had been asking me to buy this for a while. I finally did, and she watches it pretty much every day. She really likes them, and I watch with her sometimes also. It was a pretty decent television series."
5,Classic Movie,"Can a television series be more classic or more loved than ""the Little House on the Prairie""?"
1,I HAVE BEEN DUPED,"I was so thrilled to find/get this but I had no idea about the quality and the cuts. I noticed the poor quality right away. Also, the ""fancy"" cardboard packing arrived damaged. So disappointed!! Can I return this defective product?"
1,"How is this ""Complete""?","These are the edited for commercial reruns. They are chopped up. I have no idea how the title can say with any conscience - ""complete"" unless it means ""complete..ly mangled"" or ""complete waste of money"". No thanks I will wait for the UNEDITED versions to come out if they ever do. These are NOT remastered, and these are NOT uncut."
1,Warning - Episodes are cut/edited,"As others have stated, this set is heavily cut and therefore missing MANY scenes. The only ones I know of (for a fact) that are NOT cut/edited are the ones on Amazon.de called ""Kleine Huis Op De Prairie"". They have English audio so there's no need to worry about making a purchase. There are also some with the title ""Unsere kleine Farm"", but I have not personally seen them & cannot comment on if they are cut/edited or not (or if they have English audio or not). I have the ""Kleine Huis Op De Prairie"" versions so again, I can 100% confirm that they are NOT edited and DO have English audio.No idea why other countries can get 100% uncut episodes, while the US get's this garbage."
2,TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY,I bought this speakers hoping it will serve its purpose.WRONG.They always die and the volume does not stay.Does not charge the ipod (although you can purchase an optional charging system).You'r better of buying other portable speakers with lesser price.
4,One of the best bone players today...,"In addition to his studio recordings, I have seen Wycliffe play live several times. His respect for jazz tradition and obvious love for entertaining the audience always shines through."
4,Worth getting.,"This is a beautiful book, but I like her new book better. The new one has photos in the front of the book that enable you to see the originals. This one has some great paintings that are not in the new one, so still worth getting. This one has captions of the subject next to the plate whereas you have to look the info up in the back in the new one."
5,A great portraitist.,"A wonderful book that traces Elizabeth Peyton's career back to the early nineties when she started making works on paper depicting celebrities or historical figures in an intimate style up to 2005 with recent oil paintings, mostly on board, of friends or unknown, always capturing what is human and intimate in her models, whether famous or not. The quality of the reproductions shows what a great colorist she is and even gives a sense of the thickness of her brushstrokes and of the glowing effect the small jewell-like oil paintings have. So far, the definitive book on this great portraitist, with many excerpts of articles written by critics from the Village Voice to the NY Times and also an interesting interview of Craig, one of her favourite models."
4,Only a few pages of solid content...,"... but that content is pretty invaluable, especially if your D&D campaign is more fantasy than less. There's an entire table of ""beastmen"" (oh, I'm sorry, ""anthropomorphic animals"") templates for anime fans. In short, if you're a DM who wants to seriously expand the fantasy element of your game, the book has playable trolls, centaurs, sprites, ogres, minotaur, medusa and many more -- along with some fairly simple-yet-useful templates for hacking into them. That's why I bought it, and I'm satisfied enough to do it again -- despite typesetting errors and, imo, lots of wasted space. Conversely, if you're not sure you want that sort of thing in your campaign, then you'll probably want to skip this book and simply work off advancing creatures from the Monster Manual to confound your players."
4,"Good, but not perfect.","This book is ofr any DM/PC who wants to play in a different campaign. While many people would like to play as a troll, they would normally have to wait until the party is high enough then join end or they would be too powerful. In here they introduce the concepts of level monsters and it appears to work out. After buying this book I started a campaign with a minotaur, a pixie and a normal boring elf.The book is not perfect though. Every time I open it I see things that should have been caught before it went to press. missing spaces and bad page references are annoying, but at times important information was dropped. I had to use another book and back calculate the damage a lvl 1 Treant's slam would do.Overall I recommend this to every DM to add variety to a campaign."
2,This book is not necessary with 3.5,"If your playing with the 3.5 player's handbook, monster manual, and dungeon master's guide; this book is unnecessary. Because many ELs and LAs have been adjusted, and the entire system for LAs has been simplified with 3.5, this book has been rendered somewhat obsolete. It's best remaining features are some of it's example content (spells/feats/example progressions), but this book isn't going to be as helpful at a 3.5 table running a game using level adjustments."
4,Review for the Savage Species,It's a good aid for dungeon masters. Expecially when characters want to play something other than the standard character classes.Many worked out examples and lots of guidelines for setting up your own monsters as player characters.
3,The only WTOC D&D hardcover that hasn't thrilled me...,The quality of the content in this book is not up to that of the other WTOC hardcover rule books. The chapter and rules on playing monstrous characters (with character classes) is pretty solid but the remainder of the book is much weaker. The monstrous feats aren't that impressive. The chapter on advancing as a monster (without a character class) seem silly (1HD Fire Giants? Whatever?). There is a whole chapter on monster templates that simply doesn't belong here... it belongs in a monster manual. No one is going to play a gelatinous monster or a mummified monster. The small chapter on monstrous campaigns is wholly unimaginative. If the first chapter wasn't solid (and even there you have to read things over a couple of times to understand the rules) I'd give this book a 2.
4,Great Book,"I have been playing D&D for 13 years, and when third edition came out I was very reluctant to try it. But once I did it grew on me very quickly. This book is one of the better third edition books out yet. If you are interested in playing a monster or allowing them into your campaign I would strongly recommend this book. It was informative, and well put together. Some of the prestige classes I did not care for but over all great book. It took a lot of the guess work out of using monsters as PC. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever wanted to play a monster, or runs a game with players who wish to do so. I gave it 4 stars because it is good but not perfect!"
4,Satisfied Customer,I am very satified with the condition vs the listing of the book. It was listed as good condition. Itwas better than taht. It look like it had hardly been used. As listed it did have the name of a previous owner written in it.
3,Rosin,Have not been able to rate this item yet. Waiting on the Violin to arrive then I will be able to give a complete rating.
2,Ineffective rosin,This is rosin. Ugh. What can I say? I've been using it for a couple months now and this rosin just sucks. It doesn't grip the violin strings well at all and it produces so much dust. Good for beginners I guess but if you get this rosin youre going to need a cleaner to get all the dust off.
3,A slight let down from Parkinson's other dwarven tales,"This book was written by the man who wrote the first dwarven trilogy for the Dragonlance series. That trilogy was a great one, I loved it. I was expecting the same thing from this book, but was very disappointed. The book focuses on gully dwarves, which prove to be an unsuitable vessels for the author's talents. As subjects, they are simply too limited to provide ample opportunity to weave a great story for readers. The result is a less than stellar book. Get it and read it for yourself, but be aware it may disappoint."
5,Gully Dwarves Rock!!!,"The Dragonlance series creates a world in which you can get quite lost, easily. The Gully Dwarves explores the world of the ""lowest"" creatures in the world of Krynn. Often funny, always simple and possessing strengths which few in this world are aware, the Gully Dwarves is an excellent book whether you are already familiar with the series or are just being introduced to it. It is a world of fantasy, magic, gods who walk the land and a diverse range of sentient beings. The Gully Dwarves is a book I have personally read many times over and over again and it makes me laugh everytime. While the entire Dragonlance series is something to be easily appreciated, this book remains one of my favorites."
3,NOt that funny. Rather boring.,"I think the book could have been done more nicely, especially the dwarves. They just didn't seem stupid enough. But sometimes it was funny. Verden just didn't seem real enough. As for Vulpin and Chatara Kral, the whole story about that was quite stupid and unrealistic."
4,Pleasing Acting,"Shreyas acted well as the role of the boy who cannot speak/listen. He plays the role of Iqbal,18 year old, son of a farmer in a small village somewhere in India. This movie is not a ""Black"" yet it seems to have all the makings of a winner. We may never see a deaf and mute man play for our cricket yet this film fits the bill.Nasserudin Shah predicates the role of a drunk; who goes on to coach Iqbal in the film. The role played by Iqbal's sister is substantial to the plot. The film is simple and even though there was no mention of this film anywhere in the award shows and no awards were handed out to Shreyas, the fact remains, it's worth a watch or two.I've said enough. Enjoy what works for you."
3,anyone else get a heavily edited version?,"I got it as gift for a friend who's into ""hardcore"" anime. He's still mad about it - apparently the one I got has been heavily editted (according to him) because it only implies sex - it doesn't show it."
4,Good anime. I enjoyed it...,"In my opinion, it's not as good as ""Kite"" but it is very entertaining and it is definitely not for kids. The story, involving a bunch of happy-go-lucky mercenaries and violent gangsters starts off with a bang and keeps going until the last scene. Bullets, bombs, and blood fill the screen in between the car chases and fistfights. Perfect entertainment!"
3,Not that good,I first saw the movie in it's uncut form which is the only way to watch it if you saw the uncut then you know what scenes I'm talking about but other wise this is a goods film the blood and guts scene are what make it a 3 star movie and now a 1 or 2 star movie hell the scene when the baseball player gets he's head smashed in by a baseball bat is kool but the uncut is better so if your gonna get this film get it for the blood and guts scenes but if you want to real deal look for the uncut one
5,very very sweet,"this has one of if not the best action scenes ever(bowling alley scene). very nice animation, and very nice and violent.give it a watch if you're thirsty for some good action."
2,Speculative violence and expilicit rape scenes.,"I have only seen the uncut version of this film, and I must say it's really bad. The plot is virtually non-existant. This is anime exploitation filmmaking at its worst, and the reason a lot of people shun anime. I do however rate it 2 stars because it has some excellent animation (shadows correspond to characters' mouth movements etc.). This film is highly offensive and has little artistic value."
4,Picture Book,"I liked this book and plan to always keep it. It contained a lot of the same pictures I have seen over the years and I would have liked more ""never seen before"" photos. It is good to have so many of them though in one book - like a photo album."
5,Excellent,"This was a gift to my mother, Roy Rogers' best fan. She likes it very much. I also liked it very much. It is a good biography of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans."
2,Sentimental Canadians,This is a story about Kevin Spacey who is an idiot who has a kid with an even bigger idiot played by Cate Blanchett. Spacey gets stuck with a kid from the relationship and somehow Judy Dench shows up. They go to Canada or some damn place where it's cold in May to raise the kid and discover the hidden past of the family. Every person in the film seems to have some mysterious secret which you can assume is better explained in the book and this is supposed to lead to intrigue. ... If you like sentimental drivel set in Canada you will love this.
2,"Great cast, odd story.","I didn't care too much for this film. Yes I read the reviews, and gave it my usual chance by watching it until the end. I just didn't see enough good in the movie to warrant the depressing parts. Usually if we have to see things that are difficult to watch, there will be a positive payoff somewhere. Not really in this one. While there is much star talent aboard, it did seem a bit disjointed as some have suggested. Things did pick up for Spacey's character toward the end, but I'm not sure why some things were added. If his life wasn't already bad enough, the author had to add rape and incest. I'm not sure how this really was supposed to fit in, except to add more woe to another character. I'm not confused as to how it might fit in, just why. It became hard not to think his little girl was a bit weird, and disturbing. I wanted to like this film, but walked away figuratively scratching my head. I gave it two stars for the credible cast and their efforts in spite of an odd story."
3,"A decent film, but be wary if you've read the book","I heartily second Joanna Daneman's description: ""a good solid attempt to film an unfilmable book."" If you haven't read the book, you may find it quite enjoyable. But no film can express the rich language and unique flow of the original. In addition, the plot has been shuffled a bit and many of the less-dramatic parts removed. Most of the characters look and sound right, however (though Spacey isn't fat like Quoyle) and the setting--splendid island scenery, surreal flashbacks and appropriately-placed dreariness--is well-represented.The bottom line? You might like it, whether or not you've read the book. But if you have, be cautious."
5,The Shipping News,"A must for all fans of Judi Dench and Kevin Spacey. This is the first movie I have seen with them working together, and it is grand!"
4,I dig Kevin Spacey...,"A good adaptation of Annie Proulx's novel about a lifeless nebbish whose shipwreck of a life is rescued from sinking altogether by a well-timed return to emotional health and connection with other people. Some of the plot elements trod on well-worn paths: the rejuvenating influence of unpretentious small-town life, the wacky cast of locals, etc. (""Northern Exposure"" much?) But it's always a pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey at work; this isn't as remarkable a performance as his characters in ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""American Beauty,"", but the subtle shifts and learning curve of his Quoyle are still right on the mark. Worth checking out."
4,"great movie, weak beginning","I liked the plot of this movie, Kevin Spacey was great in this role and did a great crying scene (one of two movies that I have seen so far). Which makes the character more believable. The scenery is great for anyone who has been to Newfoundland. The only thing I found confusing and didn't like was Quoyle being seduced and made into a idiot. Luckily he found a nice woman named Wavey and got a great job as a reporter."
3,The Shipping News,"My two most vivid emotions while watching this movie were these: a sigh of relief when Cate Blanchett left the screen and a strong conviction that I never so much as want to set foot in Newfoundland. The character of Cate Blanchett was ugly and hateful. I was just so happy I wasn't going to have to look at her for the rest of the movie. The landscape of Newfoundland struck me as an instant dose of depression. I really want to like Kevin Spacey, but he just never came to life in this film. Judi Dench seemed wasted. This movie probably seemed as good as it did to me by contrast with the other one I watched the same day, Minority Report, a real stinker."
3,I hope this move does good but...........,"We were at the LA premier and my lack of enthusiasm pains me. I am a HUGE Kevin Spacey fan, but his Quoyle was lackluster. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between him and Moore. Dame Judi it seemed to me sleepwalked through the movie. The film seemed choppy and didn't flow at all. I really want this movie to succeed and bring Oscar nods. Maybe my review is based on the fact that Kevin himself was sitting only a few rows behind us and I couldn't concentrate. I will see this again at least twice when it's released."
3,Just a short review!,"Kevin Spacey, please find a different character to play. Again, he's some poor victimized man who's turned into a weak blob of jello and then somehow finds himself. Everyone was some how victimized in this movie except for Scott Glenn. At least there was one man in this movie who had it together and knew what he wanted out of life. Having said that, it was a pretty good movie, a little weak on character development, but a good movie to watch with your wife or girlfriend. If your single, leave it on the coffee table, dig out your VHS copy of ""The Dirty Dozen"", dust it off, order a pizza, and enjoy a really good film."
2,Whats this got to do with anything?,"OK, The film was acted well. Everything else had nothing to do with anything. Cold as Ice people, treat people cold as ice. Nuf said."
5,GREAT,Required for my son's class in English literature. This product fit the bill and arrived on time for him to make the grade.
2,You guessed it -- not as good as the book,"As a Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore fan, I intended to see this movie when it first came out, but it fell through the cracks. Then I read the book by E. Annie Proulx and loved it so much that I couldn't wait to see it unfold on screen.Sadly, I was disappointed. The movie felt like a series of scenes from the book without the emotional fabric to connect them in a meaningful way. Major characters were left out (how about Quoyle's younger daughter, for one?) for no good reason, and the beginning was blown through in such a hurry that you could hardly get a picture of what Quoyle's life was like.In many places, plot points were underexplained to the point that I wouldn't have understood them if I hadn't already read the book and had the background knowledge to apply to them.I wanted to like this movie -- I TRIED to like it -- but in the end, I didn't."
3,Detachted...in every way,"Try as I might, I can't really love this film, although it was worth to watch. The film leaves you numb, because you can't really connect with the charachters. And since you cannot connect with them, you don't care about how their lives are going.The acting is pretty solid, it's not their fault, I'm sure it's just the material. Just another book that doesn't live up to its expectations on the big screen. It's nice to see the depths of Spacey, as his portrayal of the bumbling Quoyle is believable."
2,Read Book and Did Not Get Hype. Movie the same thing!,"Read the book and was mystified as to why it was so popular. Ok story but slow drama. Movie. Watched to see how book would be turned into a movie. Again, left mystified as to why movie was made as like book, a slow drama and not all that engaging. Audience for this??? Do not know. Not a date movie for sure. With so many movies available now, recommend you check out the classics and highly recommended before you invest time or money in this."
4,Shipping News,"first saw this in the theatrical release .Nice,calming movie ,for what I remember . I hope I find it that way still,as I have purchased a copy for myself. If it should not be nice and calming and more of a WWE pay for view ,I'll simply re wrap it and give it to my 18 year old son ;) Kidding aside , good movie on a rainy day ."
3,bizarre,"Its almost surrealistic. Spacey isn't just depressed, he really acts retarded. Blanchett is almost unrecognizable as the town slut who somehow manages to stick it out for years with Spacey. Dench is mysterious and effective. The scenery is fascinating but the story is quite modest and I never cared for any of the characters. Spacey's various stages of drowning are filmed nicely."
1,unauthorized DVD,"this is an unauthorized, inferior quality DVD and not from the original Mr Wizard Studios - created by Don Herbert.Go to [...] to find all authorized DVD's from Don Herbert himself."
5,A Must Read for All Young Readers!,"I read this book over and over as a young girl. My public library had the book in a Hardcover Complilation of the Three Stories in Sucession. I must have read it every summer, losing myself in the adventures with the children in this family. I have been looking for this book for my own daughter to read and have been unsucessful in finding it in any local library. I am truely looking forward to getting a copy of it for her to read. A must Read if your child is an avid reader!"
2,Bulbs come completely unprotected in packaging,"The bulbs sound like a great idea. Problem is the packaging. I've ordered and returned once, and will likely return the second order as well. The packaging used does not hold the bulbs in place, so they crash against each other. Now they might work just fine, but with halogen bulbs that you're supposed to be very careful with while inserting, and at the price, why take a chance. Seems like someone could figure out how to package them in such a way they are protected during shipping! Just be careful."
2,There are better,I returned because the filaments were not aligned very well. There are other legal clear class high output bulbs that offer higher output and better quality.
4,Can be insightful.,"Americans might think the Xenophobe books to be ""racist"" as they try to sum up entire nations of people stereotypically. But, while it was often off the mark, it did help me to understand some things about my Dutch friend, and facilitated our communication. I've got to go clean the house before he comes to visit. :)"
5,Great Classic Movie,About 20 years ago I recall seeing this movie on cable. I loved it. When I discovered it had been made available on DVD I had to have it. It is classic. If you are a Doris Day fan this video is a must!
3,This movie is very baseball and apple pie.,"This is not one of Doris Day's most entertaining movies but entertaining none the less. The little brother made the movie for me. I had a hard time imagining Doris Day as a still living at home young adult. However, I am a die hard Doris Day fan and enjoyed it for the music."
5,Classic,"This movie is one of my favorites! Doris Day shines at a very young age of 19 in this film. I was so relieved to find this classic on DVD through Amazon!The movie is a definite ""Must-Have"" for anyone who enjoys clean, family fun entertainment. It is also a recommendation to every Doris Day collection.I recommend this movie ""hands-down""...particularly during the Holidays!Marti MelvilleAuthor of ""Deja vu: Farraige""[...]"
5,Fascinating look at obscure incident,"Although I have read about the ""Camp Grant Massacre"" in Arizona history books, this is a more in depth look at the background and participants in that event. The book was in very good shape and I will add it to my Arizona history collection."
2,Very disappointed in this product.,"We bought this for our son for Christmas this year based on glowing reviews. What a disappointment! The ""musical instruments"" are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same, the song the drum plays is tinny, scratchy, and short, and nothing seems very well made. I at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another.On the plus side, it is cute, and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound."
4,Great for a baby fascinated with noises,"After reading the reviews, I was unsure on whether to purchase this toy. I was looking for a set of musical instruments for my 6 month old baby whose sole motivation right now is to make everything she touches make a noise of some sort. Based on the reviews,I was prepared that it was not going to be as sturdy a toy as i might have liked but it was great for my child. Each instrument makes a jingle of some sort enough to satisfy a six month old but I will wait and see how long it will keep her entertained. She loves the muscial ditty the octopus plays. It is a great toy for a baby and you will be happy with it as long as you do not have unrealistic expectations of it. It is a bunch of quality, brightly colored cloth rattles with a seaside theme that make a rattle or jingle of some sort."
5,Big hit in our house.,"I gave this to my daughter for her first birthday. She is now three and still enjoys playing with it. It is cute, engaging, and well made."
2,Pan Pipe CD,"Would not play on my boom box. Worked on my laptop, but if I burned a CD off of the laptop, that one wouldn't play in my boom box either. Nice music, but bad CD."
3,"I prefer Witherington; ICC is scholarly, but too scholarly","In agreement with other reviewers, I have to say that by not speaking theological technical German, I am left suspecting that I am missing out on Barrett's best points, becuase he seems to clinch each arguement with lots of german quotations!For me, Witherington has written a similarly scholarly work, but spends more time in the text, guiding you through. Also, there is greater flow of thought, so I still manage to follow what is happening in the text, as well as following the debate: not quite so with Barrett's."
5,A Terrific Resource,"As a Professional Resume Writer myself, I use this book as my No.1 reference guide. It has served not only to provide solid examples, but shows different approaches for the one type of occupation, giving you an idea of the ranges of different styles and formats that can be applied. Its easy to find index allows you to source information easily and foreword and instruction for DIY writers are pearls of wisdom from a leader in the resume writing profession. Good for DIY'ers or as a resource for professional writers for inspiration."
5,Toward Eternity/Fade to White,This CD is great! I love Matthew Ward. This was a used item and it is in great shape. I couldn't be more pleased. The vendor was prompt and very pleasant to deal with.Thank you.
3,Defining the Business : The Starting Point of Strategic Plan,Me interesa este tema de planificación estratégica aplicada a la mercadotecnia
2,Turkish in Three Months,"As a reference book for grammar this is fine.Otherwise it's dull and offers little incentive to learn.I bought it because Rona wrote it, and her Get By in Turkish (BBC Books) is excellent.The problem with all these courses in Turkish is that the authors don't realise that the language is more 'alien'than the European languages one learns, and they all present far too much material far too soon.Start with the BBC book.It will at least give you enthusiasm, and some incentive to plough on through the rest of the dry stuff on the market."
5,I love this,"Simple, light, strong... your photography is quite different with this or with out this. You can fill the shadow in portraits and give some dramatims in your photos. In other hand, excelente for outdoor photography.I love the gold part, it's 50% gold and 50% silver, for that give to you more light (50%) and 50% gold color to your object like its tan (specially for womans)."
4,"Offbeat, Odd, Funny...","Not certain exactly why I was captivated by this movie, but I was.Movie divided in three sections. In the first section, Mr. Moretti cruises around various neighborhoods in Rome on his motor scooter sharing his offbeat observations. In the second section, Moretti explores the Italian Islands with his friend looking for a quiet place to write - encountering family and characters along the way. The final section shares Moretti's personal health issues including chemotherapy, a rash that won't go away and the loads of medical solutions offered up by the medical establishment. This movie has beautiful Italian scenery and I felt like I was on a slow walk on a breezy day in Italy - experiencing what Italians see and feel each day."
3,"Life-affirming, funny, touching and at times extraordinary.","Nanni Moretti, on one level sort of an italian Woody Allen--takes us on a veritable travelogue of the emotional interior and the exterior of Italy...while lamenting change, tragedy and the joys of dancing and the fragility of life. It has it's stalls but stick with it and just let Italy and the extraordinary soundtrack wash over you."
4,"And, I thought MY family was nuts!","I could totally identify with this family -- in fact, it made me more thankful of my own! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been estranged from a member of their immediate family. I found it to be very heart warming as well!"
5,Move over Woody Allen,"I recently saw The Royal Tenenbaums for the second time with my all-growd-up daughter, and afterwards, we laughed for whole two days, remembering the great lines and wild scenes, (like Ben Stiller slapping Gene Hackman's hand), and what a great cast. Sorry, but if you don't ""get it"", then you don't get the joy of slapstick, nor the ironic wit of our silly little lives and who we all are. P.S. I sure hope the price drops soon."
5,"If you don't get it, I'm sorry for you",The most common misconseption of this film was the wanting of some not so brilliant movie with sex and raunchy humor. I'm sorry for you shallow people who didnt get what you wanted. The film is truly a masterpiece.
2,An over-abundance of style...,"...and a paucity of substance. And any substance that's there is either unapologetically cribbed from the works of J.D. Salinger and Irving's ""Hotel New Hampshire"" (and numerous others), or is completely reliant on the inclusion of warm and fuzzy chamber pop from the 1960's to make you ""feel"" something that isn't there. Ho-hum. If not for the presence of Gene Hackman (a man who should have gone with his gut and avoided this one), there'd be nothing at all to recommend. Twee, retro outfits and Rolling Stones songs alone don't cut it."
4,A pleasure to watch on a rainy day,"If you didn't think that this movie is funny, then 1)you're not smart enough to understand the humor, 2) your life is perfect and you cannot relate to the characters, 3) you're a republican, or 3) you just don't understand dark comedies or subtle humor. The character development is great, it's a movie you can see again and again, it's just a pleasure to watch."
3,"Funny, over-the-top but empty","Quirky black-comedy about poor Mr. Royal Tenembaum (Hackman) who never really gave himself the chance to understand his bizarre family and plans to make up for it by conning them into loving him by saying he'll be dead in six weeks. But with suspicious Glover hot on his case, his life gets turned upside-down, for better or worse. Artistic and entertaining, with a cracking ensemble of a cast. But one still can't help but think that there is something missing...perhaps a less pretentious story."
2,Howlingly Overrated,"I cannot believe how Hollywood fawned over what is essentially an extended art piece that ultimately goes nowhere. A group of friends and I watched this in eager anticipation, due to the incredible reviews this movie received, only to be disappointed in the extreme. The actors (with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow, who is very dull and flat in this) are phenomenal, but it's a testament to how vacuous the script and direction are that even their performances can't make this film interesting. Wes Anderson is perhaps the most overrated director working today. Only recommended for bored college students trying to prove their hipness quotient is higher than their IQ."
1,Oh TanenBOMB!,"I spent nearly an entire week's earnings to see this disappointment! Being a huge fan of RUSHMORE, I could barely wait for Wes Anderson's next masterpiece. Our local theater was closed, so I decided to drive to Delaware with two of my compatriots. As you can imagine, they were quite disappointed as well.Gene Hackman's performance as primate Gary D'ellabate was one of the few redeeming elements of this atrocity. His lines were relevant and his humorous quips were timely and pungent. Ben Stiller, on the other hand, should receive the Darwin award for his portrayal of Fred Norris, the martian. Gwyneth Paltrow was also inappropriate for the part of Ophelia Quivers.I didn't really understand the plot... I hope Anderson's next movie befits his former legacy, if you know what I mean."
1,We wanted to laugh!!!!,"Laughter was not available during the showing of RoyalTenenbaums. While Hackmans acting was 1st class, the scriptand direction felt like late 60s Fillmore District.The funniestthings we saw were the Gipsy cabs Ben Stiller could not act hisway out of a paper bag. Huge disapointment. The best acting,outside of Hackman, was the mice. It was so bad it wasn't evenCAMP."
1,really sucks,I dont know why people thought that this is such a great movie. I personally think this movie was horrible with the dry humor that was not funny. A complete waste of time and money!!!
1,Don't waste your time!,"This film, although from the previews looked smart, funny and interesting was quite the opposite. It bored the heck out of me and every one else who's watched it. It's not at all funny, the whole film is really monotone between the acting, the story and the actors speaking. It's really not worth checking out unless you really cant find anything better to do, wash your hair even, much better use of your time!"
1,I was completely bored!!,"Based on so many rave reviews on this movie, not to mention a cast of actors I adore, I almost bought it on DVD sight unseen. Fortunately for my pocketbook, I rented first. I was completely shocked at how boring and utterly mindless this movie was. I did not even get a smile from it, much less a laugh, and I have a pretty broad sense of humor. My favorite comedy of recent years is As Good As It Gets, but I also like popcorn flicks such as Ms Congeniality, Meet the Parents, & Legally Blond. Even comedies such as Mr. Deeds, MIB II, and Goldmember, which were bombed by critics, had laughs in them. Do yourself a favor and RENT FIRST!"
2,Anderson begins to lose his grip,"The first few times I saw this film, I thought it was great. The use of music, the color, the sets, I thought they were all wonderful.Then I saw films by the directors Anderson was copying. Now, immitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this is prevelant in the Coen brothers' first 8 films, but Anderons just relies on the ideas of others, hoping people will buy them as his own.The use of color-KubrickThe seemingly lifeless character-Name a french new wave director, you got itThe use of music-JarmuschSo, all in all, this is basically Anderon's ""hey, look at the directors I like, and watch me try to copy them."" film."
2,Unsubstantial flash,"It was very disappointing to see major actors, cinematographers, and editors doing a good job with decidedly sub-rate material. The film looks much, much better than its story. One begins to have doubts when this family of ""geniuses"" reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction. The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a ""prodigy"". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers. Characters must be shown to be ""interesting"", ""conflicted"", ""in-love"", ""suicidal"", etc. by their words and actions, not simply because we are told they are. This can only be accomplished by subtle and clever writing, which is wholly absent here."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen....,"The Royal Tenenbaums....I cant tell you how eager I was to see this movie....The cast is unbelievable, and the reviews were glowing...all I have to say is ugh...I am NOT a stupid woman..my dislike for this movie has NOTHING to do with not getting it....All in all....The Royal Tenenbaums is a Royal Mess...DO NOT waste your time."
1,rent first,I watched this movie and have to say I find the talent wasted. I heard such wonderful reviews of this movie and walked out of the theater asking myself which movie did the reviewers watch. I found the movie dry and increasingly dull. The plot itself is a bit jumpy and hard to follow at moments.But none the less I wish I had rented it not gone to the theater. Because even at the rental fee I would still feel ripped off.
3,alright,I think the reason I was dissapointed with this is even though I didn't pay the high price of tickets to go to the movies. I figured this would be worth it because I absolutely loved rushmore. In a way it is worth it but I had high expectations and those expectations got lost in the horrible ending. There was only one laugh out loud funny scene.
1,"Zero stars. Waste of time, waste of tallent","Zero stars, If I couldOne of the dumbest pieces of ...., major flop from the Holywood movie industry. (Industry, not art.) Where is the comedy? What should we be laughing at? Vivid demostration of boredom and absecence of ideas. Wes Anderson went very far into pedantically detailing the environment (multyline rotary phones, jipsy cab, cardboard filled closed etc), and forgot to put content inside. Form with no content."
1,Lacking,"This movie is so goofy, that the talents of the cast are wasted. Billed as a comedy, but the movie came across as a ""Stoner Feature"", in my opinion. To me, the moment of greatest comedy was when Danny Glover fell into a hole. Gwynth Paltrow's character drained me, with her pouting, depressed manner. Also billed as a family of geniuses, I found nothing mentally stimulating about this movie. This is a silly, but colorful children's story. A spoof of life. Great, if you enjoy that sort of thing. I was expecting more."
3,www.sportofdistraction.com,"A notch down in terms of quality from Life... & Rushmore, but of the same ilk. Whereas the other 2 have more complete storylines, The Royal Tennebaums is more of an aimless journey where the viewer can merely enjoy the ride. By comparison, I prefer the other 2 to this one, but it's all a matter of what you're looking for."
2,FROM THE ANTI OWEN WILSON PULPIT,"I finally saw this movie after hearing all the great reviews. Somehow I knew I would not like it but I gave it a chance--my instincts were correct. Owen Wilson just plain stinks--he ruins just about every movie he is in--and also, he cowrote this one--another reason to be skeptical. Hackman is great. Murray and Glover are way too talented to be doing bit parts in this trashy flick. It's mildly entertaining at times which is why I don't give it one star, but one has a hard time getting over the waste of great talent, and the drabness of the characters. If you're pissed off after seeing this movie, there's good news: in ""The Cable Guy"", Owen Wilson gets his ass whooped and humiliated by Jim Carrey-- it'll make you feel better."
1,Royal Disappointment,"Was absolutely disappointed with this movie. After such glowing reviews expected to be entertained at least. The acting was good but the storyline was very boring and predictable. The characters were so unbelievable, no substance. Hated it!! Should have waited to rent it."
2,Funnyfunnyfunny,"""In this movie, the Dad leaves his family for many years and doesn't care as he watches his kids self-destruct. The spectacular way his children self-destruct is sooo funny. Many years later, the Dad tricks them all again by pretending to have cancer, just so that the Mum doesn't marry another person. They all oblige, hahaha. One of them has just lost his wife and is now also losing his marbles, oh I'm in stitches! And how funny that the other brother and the sister cannot help loving each other like Adam and Eve. Of course, the Dad is a good person who loves them all truly and deeply - so everything must be forgiven.""If you thought like that, then you probably loved the movie. Do yourself a favor and book a shrink now."
1,Royal Tenenbaums=Royal letdown,"The Royal Tenenbaums was one of the Worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching! This movie took a great cast, and what could have been a good storyline, and ruined it by trying, way to hard, to be artsy!I found the story depressed me, when it was supposed to be a comedy, I hate that! If you are in the mood for a great comedy, DON'T rent The Royal Tenenbaums, but if you are in the mood to be bored out of your mind and bummed out then this is the movie for you!"
1,<Save Yourself the Grief>,"Note to one's self....not worth the money. I couldn't even sit through ten minutes of this horrible movie. It didn't have a plot and it was filmed as a docremantry gone bad.Save yourself the grief, and skip it all together."
1,ROYAL WORST MOVIE MADE,"Without a doubt the worst movie made. Some ""movie stars"" must have been hurting for a job when they signed up for this or some major misrepresentations were made to them. Save your money and watch some paint dry. You will be ahead of the game."
1,Is there anything less than 1 star??,I am an avid movie goer and love all types of movies. This movie is one of the all time WORST ever made (right up there with The Avengers from a few years ago). There is no real story and nothing happens. You don't feel anything for the characters accept - quit feeling sorry for yourselves and get off your pity party and fix your lives.Not worth the time or money.
4,No special features?...,"First off, This movie cannot be appreciated after one viewing. Much like Wes Anderson's previous gems, 'Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore', a second and third viewing will reveal a tighter, almost flawless film. I will not delve into a hundred line review like those below, but just say, if you saw it once, you're cheating yourself. This is a ten star movie with two star DVD features, none. I'll be waiting for the special edition, whenever they decide to release it."
1,Few Laughs in a Long 2 Hours,"I always enjoy Gene Hackman, but this film was really boring. I didn't think it was funny, though plenty of people in the theatre were laughing at stuff I found simply silly. By the end of the film, many of the folks busting a side in the first 1/2 hour were asleep. And just so you don't think I'm one-in-a-hundred, my girlfriend has a completely different funny bone than me, and she wasn't laughing either. You'll get more laughs watching ""Meet The Parents"" again."
1,Terrible.,"...When I was in the theatre, barely anybody laughed. There was the occasional chuckle here and there, but really. This movie felt like it would never end. Are you sure this was suppose to be a comedy????? I found myself bored out of my mind while sitting through this... The only people who I can think would find this at all funny, is some snotty rich folk. It's terrible. Do yourself a favor, don't torture (yes, I mean torture)yourself by sitting through this never ending, exceptionally boring film. My family is still scratching their heads as to why this film got such good reviws. Are reviewers oobligated to give a film good reaviews due to the cast??????? In any case, I will never put myself through such a dragged out boring film again..."
5,amazing,"this was possibly the best movie i have seen in the past year, and undoubtedly the best picture i've ever seen in the theater. each and every one of the actors are superb, each lending humor but a distinct sadness as well. a notable part of the movie is the rich visual images present throughout the entire film. the great soundtrack also compliments it well. i've already seen it twice and hope to view it again soon!"
2,"Walked out of the theater thinking ""who cares""?","This movie had its moments for sure, good acting, etc but the critical flaw in my mind was that the characters were such a bunch of idiots that I frankly didn't care much what happened to them and by the time this movie was done, I was bored and ready to leave. Rent this one, not worth adding to a collection unless you just like the actors."
1,a Royal Mess,a Film that takes on a Dysfunctinal Family wow what a Great Concept? not!! this Film trys to hard to appeal to everybody or ever twisted concept&loses all of it's matter rather early.No Chemistry whatsoever here to me&the Film just goes on&On&Never seems to come to any actual meaning to me.a ROyal Mess is a better name to me.
2,SO and SO nothing to brag about,"The previews are clever and showed the comidic parts,,, I hesitated to see it and in theaters and I am glad I did becuase it would h ave wasted my $5..... But anyway The Royal Ten Tenenbaums has a mixture of some drama,comady,and just plane diolge. The first time I remeber turning it off after the first 15 min witch is based on the 3 kids growing up. But the second time I had a honest effort to sit threw it and I did. Like I seid already it is so and so nothing to brag about I dont see why credics rave about it?!?!?. Alough a comedic part is Ben Stiller playing a farther who is protective over his children since his wife died. I do admit that there really is NO backround music and Iam a person who beleves that backround music is what makes the scene one to remeber. So that slows down the movies way much.All in all Just rent it or even better yet just catch it on HBO,Showtime or Starz. But alough it has a great cast thats what made it standable to watch."
2,A LITTLE Too Self-Concious?,"Self-conciousness is what ""Tenenbaums"" is all about: it's the entire point. The film's inverted universe collapses into itself so completely that nothing can escape, most especially laughs.This movie is a textbook example of the difference between ""witty"" and ""funny"". Yes, it's intelligent, well-acted and witty. Computers (and insecure intellectuals) undoubtedly could point out all the correct spots at which to pump out a forced ""ha!"" of admiration.But, good grief... for the rest of us, this is a tedious and vaguely repellent waste of talent.Pay NOT to see this one. If you need an Anderson hit, ""Bottle Rocket"" is better, and ""Rushmore"" is actually rather good."
1,don't bother!,"auuugh what a pretentious film. Attempting to be poignant, insightful and funny and it does none of these. Talk it over with your arthouse buddies at starbucks and pretend you loved it...but you didn't...because you couldn't!"
3,Part Portrayal Part Parody On The Dysfunctional,"The Royal Tenenbaums is a mildly amusing parody on a wealthy dysfunctional family that has rapidly declined. Although the cast is loaded with stars such as Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Bill Murray, somehow neither of them really extend themselves as overly amusing. Gene Hackman's character is notably disliked particularly with many of his insensitive comments to his children when they were growing up. He abandons the family during a critical part of their lives and tries to re-enter later on when he needs their support.During this reentry period there are a few amusing moments. However there is plenty of bitterness and deceit. However, there are some moments when the family does strive to be whole and that does balance the film from being overly dreary.My overall impression is that the film has moments of interest but moments of annoyance. Three stars on this five star scale seem about right."
2,Disappointment of the Year,"This is one of those movies where the trailers and previews were better than the sum of the film. While the outstanding cast of Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Murray may have done a mostly fine job of playing their individual roles, the movie just doesn't gel, and certainly doesn't provide the guffaws one was led to expect. I found myself glancing at my watch several times during the last half of the flick to see how much longer we would be made to endure this dull, predictable storyline, which is something I am rarely driven to do during a movie. The most the movie was able to do was elicit a couple of chuckles from me, and unfortunately, that was about the highlight of my night at the movies."
2,A Royally Terrible Movie,The Royal Tenenbaums was a huge cast of poeple who should have been extremely great but it was not that special and I have seen some good dark comodies and this is not one.I never got the story at all with Gene Hackman-Ben Stiller-The Wilson Broters-Gwenyth Paltrow-Danny Glover and Bill Murray the king of dark comodies you better get it right and it somehow was not.Story 1 Acting 7 Direction 9 Action 4 Entertainment 3Overall=24/50 wich is 48% this was not great allBuy only if you love dark comodies
1,"terrible, and a waste of time and money","oh this movie was terrible, I have never seen such a huge piece of junk. It is way too long, lacks a plot, any sort of interesting dialogue, and really any meaning at all. It meanders from very unfunny jokes about money to ones about mentally retarded people, very low brow and not for anybody who enjoyed rushmore, or rambo. The worst movie of the year."
1,Awful movie,"This is one of the worst movies I ever suffered through. As other reviewers have stated, it was boring, pointless, and not at all entertaining. We only watched it because we paid for the rental, perhaps hoping it would get better. It didn't. If it had been on TV, I would have turned it off way before halfway through."
1,Duped and Disappointed,"Don't waste your money on this slow moving, dismal comedy. Big name actors and a defibrillator couldn't bring this ""comedy"" to life. The biggest disappointment of all was popping it into the DVD player, pushing play and hearing the voice of Alec Baldwin coming through the speakers. Never would I have spent my hard earned AMERICAN money on a film that employed this America-hating, so-called actor who should have left the country long ago."
2,I film vapidly desperate to prove it's quirkiness,"While others found this film to be ""clever"" and ""witty,"" I found it to be pretentious and pointless. The whole plot is some kind of clever and insightful story about a crude and horrible man who wants his for-too-long-neglected family's money. His family, of course, features the most ""comedic"" and ""quirky"" of people: The neglected and emotionless playwrite daughter, the washed-up tennis player, the paranoid maniac who never got over the loss of his wife, and the dorky but loveable ex-wife. *sigh* Gee, how deep and pseudo-clever.Well, if you want to see ""art"" at it's worst or how to fool everybody into thinking your are clever, take notes on this movie. Otherwise, see something with REAL substance."
4,Superb,"This delightfully original and offbeat comedy is made even more amusing because its played by such a deadpan, mainstream cast: you only have to look at Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum to laugh. The script is hilarious without requiring the gross-out humor of the Farrelly brothers. (Check out the paintings in writer Elijah's apartment.) This has its slapstick moments, but it's ultimately aiming for something higher. It's a story about familial alienation and reconciliation, and comedy is just the right medium for tackling it."
