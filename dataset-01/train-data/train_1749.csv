1,Item not as pictured or described,I have ordered this item twice from two different sellers and have not received the item pictured. You will instead receive the fisher price blue canapy bed that you can find everywhere else. Very frustrating to have to figure out a replacement so close to Christmas
5,My daughter loved it!,Great add to our loving family house! My daughter says it's her room. Nice details like the real little pillows and a canopy over the bed.
3,Feels Like Flying: The Low level Tour of Scenic America,Was disappointed in the quality of the video camera used as some of it was not too clear-- Disappointed to see on large screen TV-- Probably OK on a laptop size screen--Some of the scenes are repeated in the DVD of almost the same name--EJV
2,Would not buy again,Hoped this video would serve as an educational tool for people who are unfamiliar with the USA ... giving pictures and skeletal information about the country... NO SUCH LUCK. It is low level scenic aerial photography without commentary. Would not recommend to a friend.
5,Certainly a Must read for All Christians,"As a convert to the Eastern Orthodox Church I alwas recommend this book before any others to anyone curious about Christian Orthodoxy. Fr. Charles Bell was a Presbyterian Minister who went on a year long quest to disprove the Orthodox Church and its claim to be ""THE HISTORICAL NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH"" and ended up becoming an ordained Orthodox Priest. I offer this quote from the book on page 10 ""Jesus said 'I will build my church and the gates of Hades shall not overpower it' (Matt.16:18)"".Father Charles began to ""trust more in God to lead him, rather than the devil to decieve him"" as he went about his quest. I recommend Protestant(s) and Roman Catholics do the same in their own quest to cut through the heresy and hypocracy of Christian history."
5,Sexy atoms,"It is a good product. It is a bit difficult to manage in the begining because it has tightly fitting parts, but regular use gets rid of that. I like this product, it serves its purpose. I would, however like to have more hydrogens to make more complex organic compunds. Still, 5 star product."
3,Authobiography of Brusselmans,"This book is written in the I person. It is the author himself speaking in the book. Actually in a depressed mood, drifting from whisky to whisky and from woman to woman. It's good for the lovers of the Brusselmans genre (sex-money-alcohol). But not his masterwork."
5,A Must Read for Couples!!!!,"I have given this many times to couples, young and old. I am sad that it isn't being published in CD. It is a conversation between the two and while it is helping men and women understand each other, it is VERY funny and entertaining."
3,Maybe I'm just uncoordinated..,"..but this video is a little hard to follow, at least the first time. The instructor moves really quickly and there isn't much practice time for the moves. It had me sweating but a lot of the time I was completely not following along. Still a good workout, and I imagine with some practice it wouldn't be hard to keep up."
4,Fun!,"First of all, the people on the front cover are not actually in the video. But it's fun and fairly easy for people who have a hard time keeping up. The lead instructor is fun & spunky little woman who does a great job & the chitchat between her & a man named John is funny and entertaining.A cheap & fun workout!"
5,in times of trouble . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,"some caring, good friends gave me Reverend Hagin's book, HealthFood: A daily Guide to Spiritual Nourishment for the Soul when i was anguished over my husband's cancer diagnosis. it helped me through some hard times. i recommend it when man is not enough."
5,"Don't Own It But, I know this:","Track Listing:1. Pop Quiz2. Extension Trip3. How To Play Your Internal Organs Overnight4. The Brush Descends the Length5. Melochord Seventy-Five6. Space Moment7. UntitledThis EP was a limited pressing, which was released in 1995, 1 year prior to the popular album ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"".IF YOU WANT THESE SONGS THOUGH, TRACKS 1-6 APPEAR ON THE COMPILATION: ""Aluminum Tunes: Switched On, Vol. 3""."
2,Cheap construction-Hope it holds together,"We purchased subj multi-purpose knife to supplement our emergency survival kits. However, scissors already do not work and construction is such that we doubt it would hold up over long duration. However, you get what you paid for it-Cheap."
1,dont buy,"i dont have one of these, but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! spend 17 more dollars and get a real one. please dont buy this rip off piece of crap."
1,Hate this vacuum,"I own two of these. One for a vacation home and a newer one for main home. The newer one just burnt out the motor after 3 years!! The belt is constantly coming off and it is cumbersome. I paid almost $200 for a 3 year vacuum. I don't know what has happened to Hoover quality in the last few years, but my older Windtunnel is better.I cannot recommend this vacuum unless you want to replace it sooner than later. BTW, Eureka wasn't any better."
2,Watch out sweeper will tip over on you!,"This sweeper is okay, it has good suction, expecially the hose feature, but that is where my major complaint comes about, the hose is way to short, also I have had the sweeper tip over on me numerous times and that didn't feel very well and I probably could have thrown it out the window! Also when I put all the attachments on the hose they seem to pop off while I am sweeping, but that could be because the hose it just way to small."
4,Works well,For the price you pay. It does a great job picking up items. It is easy to control sort of pushes itself. Even with a right arm that is painful I can vacuume my whole house with no problem.
5,Hoover Windtunnel Supreme Vacuum,"We've owned a Hoover upright vacuum for years and Eureka uprights before that. We bought a new one because an impeller blade broke on the one we had. It was about 8 -10 years old. This new model is great!. It's not as loud as the previous one, and it really seems to clean the carpets much better. In one room where we used to use baby powder a lot, I noticed the light coming on indicating extra dirt. The old vacuum had certainly not picked it up.I like the way the vacuum seems to pull itself on the forward push as though its self propelled. You work a lot less with this vacuum."
1,a waste of money.,"I had a Hoover Windtunnel Supreme bagged upright vacuum in 2000. It worked very well until sometime in 2003, when I replaced it. I have a dog and two cats, so I need a good vacuum. I replaced it with highly rated vacuum, that also worked well for three years until it started going downhill. So I got another Hoover Windtunnel Supreme Bagged Upright.This new on is a piece of junk. I've had it two months, gone through 2 belts, and I'm ready to throw it in the garbage. It's lighter weight than the last one, and doesn't seem to work as well. It doesn't even hold together well - for example, the end keeps coming off of the handle as I vacuum.Did I mention it just doesn't work very well? Because it really doesn't."
5,Excellent Vacuum,"I normally prefer bagless, but this model is a very effective and powerful machine. It is self-propelled and so very easy to use--barely any effort required. I would recomend this vacuum."
1,Disappointed,"I have used a lightweight Hoover for years and was very pleased with it. When I first received this new cleaner I was really excited with the power it had. The third time I used it the belt broke. With each use, my back would start hurting. The forward motion was very easy, but pulling it back was hard. I returned this product because I felt there was something wrong with it."
2,Fine at First then Serious Problems,"Worked well for a few months and it does have really good suction from the hose. However, over time the spinning brush got less and less effective and now will not work at all making it pretty much useless.I have had much less expensive vacuums last much longer.I would not recommend buying this model."
1,It cleans.,"I have had this for a year. I have two areas that are carpet and the rest of my house is hard wood. I do a lot with the hose and attachments. I wouldn't buy this again. First of all the on/off switch stopped working and my husband had to put a permanent fix on this. The hose is too short. When I am cleaning with the hose and attachments the sweeper falls over usually hitting me in the back. Let me tell you, it hurts if it hits the wrong way. The back clip that holds one of the tools broke off while sweeping. The front clear closure kept breaking off until I eventually kept it off. Again, I wouldn't buy this machine again. I will make sure my next one has a long enough hose and doesn't fall over on me or my children."
2,Not like My Old Hoovers,"Total junk,...-Handle falls off every time I use it...really cheap construction...-Switch doesn't turn unit off half the time... a real safety concern...-Sound like a jet plane on takeoff...get ear plugs!-Power cable attachment does not work...always running over the cable...-Cannot use extension cleaning tools because the hose is so short and the unit is so light-weight that typical cleaning chores pull the unit over.My twenty-year-old, self-propelled Hoover is gonna have to last another 20 years because I am ready to throw this POS! out after 1 year...Hoover? Never again."
1,Broken switch in only 16 months,"Owned this vacuum only 16 months and the on-off switch is already broken. We're not too compulsive about vacuuming, so I doubt if it has been used more than 20-30 times. Already had to replace the brush drive belt once. No complaints about the way it cleans, or the weight. The bag-changing procedure is not great-it's not easy to get the compartment open."
1,Hoover U5468-900 Quality,This vaccuum is a joke. We purchased one and it vibrated quite a bit and sounded like an Cessna twin engine airplane taking off. We sent it back and received another; same situation. We thought it was factory defect. The second unit we received was sent back as well. Do not buy this vacuum. Eventually purchased another Hoover model vacuum locally. No problems...
3,Works well enough,This product works fairly well but no better than the cheaper Oreck I used to have. The clean indicator light seems to get confused by darker carpet. In addition the off button doesn't work very well even though I've used it less than half a year and rarely use it.
1,DO NOT BUY HOOVER SEL PROPELLED VACUUMS,"HOOVER HAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE BELTS STRETCHING OUT ON ALL THE SELF PROPELLED VACUUMS, BUT WIL DO NOTHING FOR CUSTOMERS STUCK WITH THEM! WE MUST REPLACE THE DRIVE AND PROPEL BELTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. REDICULOUS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
1,Not good.,"I bought this vacuum about 1 year ago. I've had nothing but trouble with it! I took it to a warrantee dealer a few months back because the red warning light stayed on all the time. It took them 4 weeks to find a bad integrated circuit. They replaced the IC, returned it and two days later the light came back on, to stay!(All filters are clean and always maintained.) About a week ago, the machine is now 13 months old, I tried turning off the machine with the on/off switch. No dice. The machine stays on as long as plugged into AC. I tried moving the on/off switch back and forth several times and the vacuum still stays on! The only plus is that it does a fairly good job of vacuuming."
1,Works great... at first,"I bought this vacuum in August 2006. For the first year, I loved it. It performed wonderfully. After about a year, I noticed that the on/off switch was a bit fussy. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not. Now, I can only turn the vacuum on and off by plugging it in and unplugging it. At around the same time that the on/off switch started acting up, the dirt sensor light started to flicker aimlessly, too. Now, when I dare to vacuum, it works OK on carpet (set at the hardwood floor setting) and it just blows dirt around on a hardwood floor. I used to own a Hoover that was about 30 years old. Then I bought this one because I wanted hoses and I chucked the old one. What a mistake! I'm now shopping for a new vacuum that will stand the test of time and other user reviews."
1,Sucks and Not in the Good Way!,"I spent days researching vacuums and thought I had a winner. TOTALLY WRONG. I knew when I was unpacking it that it wasn't gonna be great. The very FIRST time I used it the belt broke. I tried replacing it and it was impossible. I quit when I cut my finger. Also, there is a gap between the roller assembly and the actual vacuum. When I took it apart to change the belt it was jam packed with fur and dirt. And that wasn't even in the roller assembly where it could have explained the belt breaking! All of this in 10 minutes of vacuuming. Needless to say, I'm sending it back."
1,Wot aload ...,OMG!i am a massive fan of jt and that cd has ruined his brill songs!'let's take a ride' was my fav song and now that stoooopid cd has scared me for life!TO ALL THOSE EEJITS WHO THOUGHT MAKING THIS CD WOULD BE FUN AND A GOOD TRIBUTE I HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY TO Y'ALL..... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!no 1 can do better than JT!
1,Uhhhhhh.....WHAT THE???,"All i can say is i got suckered into buying what I thought would be a neat spin on justin's hits...unfortunately I didn't get to read any reviews and bought it in a store..I can't believe they allowed these HORRIBLE guys to put Justin's name on the CD! It's AWFUL! I popped it in the CD player right after I got in the car, after I stopped laughing from disbelief I immediately searched for the receipt to see if I could return this piece of crap..all I have to say is I hope justin gets a piece of what these guys are making off of his songs and his name!"
3,What the.... Okay has he been with Michael Jackson,"I don't really get the point of a tribute to Justin no offence, yeah sure he's good but not really like those stars like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow. Don't be so byst towards such atrocities no offence to fans out there. But any how this compliation is good regardless of the title of the 'album'. Bye and well enjoy? I don't know........."
2,RIGHT!lol,Its oke who is this guy is he like the biggest fan ever to like Justin timberlake to be on a cd lol i mean come on hes not that good!but i think its a good idea to have tribe for Justin Hes soo awsome!such a good singer too but if i was u i rather get the REAL justin CD!~
2,i would have to agree,"I would have to agree with the person above. Its nice that there is a tribute to Justin, but he does it WAY better. He's original, and nobody can do it like he does it. It doesn't put out the same vibe as his album does. I would recommend just buying his album, because you get more out of it. He puts out music like you've never heard, i don't care what anybody says, he's 100% ORIGINAL, and he's doing a great job."
2,I would have to agree,"I would have to agree with the person above. Its nice to have a tribute to Justin, but he definitly does it better. He is original and nobody can do it like he does it. It doesn't have the same vibe as the original album. I would recommend just going out and getting his album instead because you definitly get more from it. He puts out music like nobody else, I don't care what anyone else thinks, Justin is 100% ORIGINAL, and he's doing a great job."
1,Waste of money!,"I personally don't 'get' tribute albums, especially when the real thing (Justified/Justin Timberlake) was only released 8 months ago!!Don't waste your money buying this - GO GET THE REAL THING, it's a MILLION times better AND THEN SOME!!!"
1,Who are these Justin TimberFAKES?,"I would not buy this album if it were the last album left on this universe. First of all, who is singing? Is this Vol. 3 for american idols greatest hits or is this a cd for karaoke? If I were Justin I would sue. Is this a collaboration with Ashton Kutcher and Britney Spears to PUNK Justin. This cd is a joke!!!!Please donate your money to me and I will make a better cd."
1,U HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDIN ME!!!!,"Ok, i almost bought this cd, but decided to get the samplers first...THANK GOD. You have got to be kiddin me wit this cd.. it must be a joke or w/e, if they thought tha n e one was gonna buy this...its garbage.. the person on their needs to stop singing.. and poor Justin.. he got his own personal work torn into millions of lil pieces... I couldnt stop laughing when i actually heard this...lol..."
1,No way,Okay so I just listened to the samples and I'm sorry but even if those weren't JT songs I wouldn't buy that album. They have no style or rythm to them. It's like an all over the place album. And how someone different seems to find each song. I'm just not feeling the songs at all. They are missing the element that makes those songs and I just...I know I'm being harsh but I just don't feel it one bit!
2,"I'm sorry, but","I loved Meg O'Brien's Jesse James series and was disappointed when they ended. I read Gathering Lies - the first O'Brien book I read since that first series and really liked the book. It was very good. But Crashing Down? I agree with one reviewer. The author should have just written her own life story instead trying to fit it into a suspense novel about other people. I found this book very dark and hard to get thru - meaning there just wasn't anything there - nothing compelling you to read. I made it to 2/3 thru and just skimmed the rest. I didn't like the character development of Nicky and I didn't get much in the way of a growing love relationship between Nicky and Callie. Her descriptions of the abuse scenes were chilling, especially since you knew from the forward that they were based on her own experiences, but the rest of the book seemed to be lacking something. I tried to read to the end, but just gave up."
4,Works as intended,"I purchased this item to use on an Earth Auger, even though it's intended for an Ice Auger. I had to modify it to fit by trimming the area below where it bolts to the auger(this may not be necessary with Ice vs Earth augers though).The steel isn't very thick and seems pretty mild, but it functioned well to drill five 8"" holes through sandy soil with some rocks and roots. It hasn't shown any signification wear. I'm confident it will work just fine and last as long as I'll need it."
5,Lotus Blossum,"Wonderful read. Recommend to those who must spend time in a foreign land and bring their children (military, contractors, expats of all sorts). Provides unique perspective of life in a very different culture that a teen can truly appreciate. If you plan to travel to India and bring your kids, bring it along!!!"
1,Not as pictured.,"This item is not as it is in the picture. I ordered it for a relative to match the one in the photo and it is two different things, the old style as pictured has 7 fan blades and is built sturdy. The new model is cheaply made and has only 5 fan blades and it weighs less by far. and is sold everywhere for $20 to $30 .Don't pay $56 plus shipping. Be Warned.Bill(btjr)"
5,Troubled Youth Loved This Book,"As a volunteer working with boys in the juvenile justice system, I was able to read this book to some troubled youths at a residential treatment center. They thought the book was terrific--not only did they identify with the cases described, but the legal afternotes provoked much discussion about the consequences of their own actions. It is written at a level that even the boys with limited verbal skills could understand it."
3,"Good, but not great.","Mr. Simons has written a good book. However, it is very similar to a lot of titles which are out there. I did an internet search, and I found at least two dozen listings on the subject of classic radio shows. Many come with CD's, and some great audio clips of the old shows. There is no doubt that Mel knows his material. And he is certainly old enough to have personally known a lot of the stars of the radio era of the 1930's, 40's and 50's.However, old time radio is passe, and as more and more of its fans pass on, books of this genre will become obsolete. I look forward to reading the TV book."
1,"usless, sized for a rat?","usless, sized for a rat?the collar is extremely small, and you can probably put it on a rat only, as it is even too small for the smallest dogs out there."
5,Learn to know Unknown Hinson,"""Rock & Roll is straight from hell"" is one of the best new albums I've heard in the last 5 years! If you like rockabilly, psychobilly, country western with a twist, if you like the Reverend Horton Heat, Hank Williams III or most Punk thats not record lable pop to make a miilion bucks, Check this guy out. I heard his album and was BLOWN AWAY! Then I saw him live... three times!!! He's unbelievable! His guitar abilities parallel Jimi Hendrix, his song writing is witty and funny and memorable, his image is... well... scary, but don't let that stop you from being the first cool kid on your block to own the CD from the next new craze in music. Seriously, check it out, it's sweet!"
4,Great CD and Even Better to See Hinson Live!!,"Unknown Hinson is many things: a character; writer of witty and often ""mature"" themed lyrics; a unique personality; truly talented musician. This guy is the REAL deal and worth driving hours to see perform live (I've done this several times). He can play every style of music on his guitar and he's got the attitude to pull it all off, from blues to country to psychedelic rock. Hank Sr. and Jimi Hendrix (RIP) would be proud of him, and I'll bet Alice Cooper is, too. The only thing better than this CD would be an all-live one. This womern would give that 5 stars for sure."
2,He pushes Fox news,"I like the Hunt and what he has to say. But then one night listening to him on the jerry doyle show the hunt say that Fox new was the only station talking about terrorism. Thats when I knew he was just pushing his book and Fox news. Because we all know that Fox has decided that there is no war going on. They refuse to talk about any war issue. Unless they bring on a wounded soldier who just can twait to get back to the war.You should go to CNN and listen, they talk about all aspects of the war. Good and Bad."
3,Near perfect title,"Col Hunt doesn't get it, with his continued insistence at every occasion to tell anyone listening that Islam has been hijacked and it is being perverted .When it is clear the Quran calls for the subjugation and eradication of all non muslims, I m not sure I can trust him to get anything right."
2,Rubber stamp,"Col David Hunt when he appears on Fox News Channel I find to be very in the know.However this book could have been writen in two or three chapters, for a total of one hundred pages or less. After the first three chapters, subsequient chapters could have been writen with a rubber stamp."
1,Sounds Like a Nut-Job to Me,I suppose it is important to know people like this are out there and in the military.
4,Required reading for every American,"Easy to read, full of common sense, this book should be read by every American."
2,Embarassing,"I'm as hawkish as the next guy. And I don't mind the conversational tone and profanities. What bothers me is the repeated errors in Hunt's book. For example, contrary to Hunt's assertion, the Patriot Act has nothing to do with holding Jose Padilla as an enemy combatant. Zip. Zero. Nada. (As Hunt might put it himself.) Just a little research, like actually reading the opinions in Padilla's case, would show that the U.S. government has not cited a single provision of the Patriot Act as justifying his detention. Instead, it is the President's war powers under Article II of the Constitution that are at issue. How can you call yourself a ""terrorism expert"" and get stuff like this wrong? It's embarrassing."
2,Built to a price unfortunately,"I bought this printer as a replacement for a 1220C non duplex printer as duplexing has become a must for our company. I have had this product for 2 years and probably run no more than 200 sheets of paper through it. The quality is superb when it works. It has now developed a fault which makes it as good as useless as it requires a replacement part which I understand would cost almost as much as the printer if I could actually get it. Looking on the HP web-site forums I note that this particular problem appears to be rather too common for this make of printer. I cannot recommend it and suggest you look elsewhere. Shame, as I really rate HP printersI will be junking it"
1,Amazon.com sold me shelf-waned book as new one.,I purchased this book from amazon.com LLC as new book.But I received shelf waned book and the package was untidy.I doubt Amazon.com gave me a book which was already corner-bent book.Cannot believe their 'new' anymore.Be careful!
5,A great guide to TEE !,This concise book provides a clear overview of TEE with lots of clear illustrations and nice tables. Highly recommended for cardiac anesthelogists and for cardiologists involved in intraoperative echocardiography. Comes with a CD with illustrative cases for further learning and review.
5,Reasonable basis for PTEeXAM study,"I successfully passed the PTEeXAM using this textbook as the foundation for my study.As the title suggests, it is geared towards practical clinical use, and it's advisable to supplement with Perrino, Otto or Mathew/Ayoub.The included CD is decent but nothing spectacular.I can't think of any glaring deficiencies or problems with this book. It's concise and compact. I look forward to the next edition of this text!"
4,A pragmatic guide to dealing with antagonist.,"Kenneth Haugk presents a difficault subject in an enticing manner. He leads you through a maze of difficulty to a solution that, though not easy, is achievable. His style is easy to follow by non-psychologists, never reverting to the pretentious cover of esoteric language. Facts and conclusions are presented clearly and distinctly. You are guided to a course of action that you can control."
4,Good Ideas for resolving conflicts,"If your organization has a problem member who thrives on conflict, this book will give you some ideas to handle the situation."
4,Vital Resource for Clergy & Other Leaders,"I re-read Hougk's book at least once a year and have given it as a gift to the lay leadership of my congregation. There are many works out there on dealing with church conflict, but this one pulls no punches in naming the evil that is the source and giving ""front line"" advice about how to combat it. While the obvious goal is reconciliation and cooperation as part of the Christian community, getting there must involve acknowledging the truth about conflict. Most clergy worth their salt know that compromise with sinful behavior, however rationalized, is counterproductive in the long run. Buy this book!"
4,Put Your Body In It!,"This is a great collection of classic tracks as spun by legendary DJ, Larry Levan. At first listen, I wasn't too thrilled with this purchase, but when I realized five months later that I was still listening to it everyday, I knew I had to re-evaluate my first response. The CD's are filled with some amazing songs, including the beautiful and melodious Ashford and Simpson song which starts out the first disc, and Stephanie Mills' ""Put Your Body In It."" Every time I hear this song, I never fail to put my body in it, even when I'm on the subway...It is also a great collection because you get to hear Larry's style of spinning, which, although stellar, is not seamless as you would imagine. Instead, he spins high drama, crashing new songs into the mix and taking you on an incredible disco journey. A must-have for any disco fan."
5,This is where it all started.....,"If you are into any kind of dance music, then this cd is an essential one. Outstanding track selection and mix by Mr. Levan himself. A rare and special recording that will last for many years to come, guaranteed to put you in a dancing mood everytime you listen to it!!! This is the real thing. Go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"More annoying than danceable, since I'm partial to *songs* and tunes. Vocal-less house music is not going to get me up on my feet. If you know what you're getting, and like this style (stripped of vocals and melody), then go for it -- it seems to be a good example of that type of music."
4,"Wow Kitana, you are HOT!","This DVD was suprisingly good, especially for the low price. You get some very good segments with the ""second to none body"" of Kitana Baker. They even show some of her friends for fun. Kitana looks Hot all the way through on this one. Her bedroom scenes are great with nice close ups of Kitana in a thong."
4,fence in the mist coasters,The coasters work great the only problem was one of them was broke.I was given a refund for the one that was broke.
3,meh,"love the design on the front, very nice stone, but the cork on the back makes them look a bit cheaper than I was wanting. nice to look at when you don't look too closely"
5,fast and reliable,Bought this printer for a workgroup at an architectural firm and it has worked flawlessly now for a year and a half. Love this printer.
5,my first tablet and I love it,this is amazing! You can write and it recognizes it and converts it to text. I wrote this whole review with the tablet. great if you like to draw or design games. great price and surprisingly great quality! when using in Photoshop-it recognizes how much pressure is applied and is great for shading. I think thatS about it. ha.
3,I did not do enough research before buying,"I did not realize that the tablet maps directly to the monitor screen. This means that where I put the pen on the tablet, that same geographic spot is where I touch the screen. So I can't just start drawing in the middle of the tablet and expand my drawing from there unless that is the exact location I want to do the drawing on the screen. I would need a comfortable table to rest the tablet and draw with a floating arm. It is hard to explain so I'm sorry if I'm not being clear. I was hoping for more flexibility in how I could touch the tablet to draw. It is too literal for me."
4,Good but need better battery,Can do almost anything using adobe Photoshop or other. Downside to it is the battery. Other than that is good.
3,Watch out for that PEN,"The tablet works quite well and is perfect for close quarters. HOWEVER, the pen is very unstable. Upon the first use, the pen looked bent...it was. I took an oversize ballpoint pen barrel and cut it in half length wise. I used that to stabalize the pen. My fear is that if you don't do that the pen will break. I don't think you can find a replacement short of buying another tablet.. Hope this helps someone."
1,PenCommander and Annotate does not work on Windows 7 or Vista!!!,"This product does not work on Windows 7 or Windows Vista.It only half works.If you are trying to use this with Photoshop you just won't be able to.Not that I can see. Especially since you need PenCommander to use Photoshop and Paint!I don't know why I thought this would be a good by.I hate how it doesn't give you that information online, you just have to get it in the mail to find out.When you look at the Tablet Software Manual you will find this out too!!!"
5,great product,"1st you may want to install a fresh new AAA battery in your pen. Then do all the rest. Lol, it took me awhile to figure that out! Works great with windows 7 & Ms paint. And works great with my Acer netbook. Great tool for a good price."
2,DigiPro Tablet Disappoints,"The DigiPro tablet is an inexpensive stylus tablet which does not perform well enough to be an acceptable substitute for the Wacom it is meant to compete with. It is a clever design, though, and with additional development might work better. Its battery-powered stylus is sometimes too sensitive, other times not at all. Battery life is too short. Would have been better off saving my pennies and buying a Wacom Bamboo. Nice try, just didn't quite make it."
2,Looks NOTHING like picture,"This looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture for the product. Nothing like the company picture or the user pictures. Item is listed as DigiPro WP5540 and even has a sticker added to the box that states that is what it is. What I got was Digi Pro 640. A cheap and flimsy mouse-pad type thing. It does seem compatible with my computer. Due to time constraints, I will give it to my son for Christmas and let him decide if it is still what he wants. If not, will return. (I am uploading a few pictures of what we actually received)."
3,Not Impressed,"This is the first time I've used a graphics tablet, and I have to say, I'm really not impressed. It's since been packaged up and tossed into a drawer, probably to never be looked at again.I just found that it was not intuitive at all. The dark writing against the dark background made it extremely difficult to see what buttons are on it. Very little in the way of documentation on how to actually use it."
5,asome,This works so much better than a mouse... enjoy editing in Photoshop elements 10...and the price was a very attacking...
3,Wasnt what i needed....,I bough this to help with my online math class but it does not work the way i interpreted the description...it is still a neat product and i will be giving it to my daughter this year for Christmas...she is 4 and should enjoy this immensely.
2,"Save your money, save your time...","First off, there is no online support whatsoever. Second, the stylus will jump from spot to spot intermittently wasting tons of time having to correct or erase marks. In fact, using a mouse I was able to get my work done much faster it was that annoying. The purpose of getting a tablet was to make the artwork easier not harder. Also, the stylus sensitivity is pretty weak. seemed like a device where you would go through many pen nibs. Granted the device is only $25 or so, but save your money and get a WACOM instead, which is tenfold better."
2,Software Sucks,"Bought the 8x6"" tablet from DigiPro (I no longer see that size tablet available, so am reviewing the smaller size).The software that came with my tablet would not install correctly (had a warning pop up that the Window's Logo Certification for the program was invalid or corrupted). Tried to install anyway, and none of the programs will actually start up. Terrific.Plugged in the tablet itself, and LCD light blinked continuously, but apparently will not work at all without use of the included programs (which are defunct). I'm gonna try to return this and get a Bamboo."
1,TOO GEEKY TO BE USEFUL,"I was looking for an input device to use with a drafting/CAD program. I was expecting to use a pen to draw lines on a tablet. In other words, I wanted to put the pen on the pad, draw a line,lift the pen and the line stays put. This pad is too sophisticated to do do this. The cursor starts moving when the pen is in mid-air, before it touches the pad. This feature cannot be turned off. Thus, accuracy is impossible as the cursor won't stay where it is put. Thank you Amazon, for your hassle free return."
4,Daughter Loves it!,"Bought this for my 15yr old daughter and she hasn't stopped using it. Works in Mypaint on Ubuntu 12.04 right out of the box (after putting in a good battery). The pen is cheap, but what do you expect for this price range? Definitely a good product for a beginner and probably even someone a little more advanced."
5,So far so good!,"I purchased this for teaching an online math course. So far it's working great with both my mac and pc. I just put in the battery (take off the plastic first--oops, small panic there) and plug it in. I didn't add the software. Much easier than trying to write on the whiteboard with a mouse, and it works in place of the mouse the rest of the time, which is great for lefties like me too. With a mouse on the left and a ten-key on my right I'm super fast! :)"
4,DigiPro WP5540 graphics tablet,"Purchased as a gift - the person who received it likes it a lot. When we installed it, it seemed a little bit simple. Seems like the Windows interface could be more integrated. That said, she's doing some wonderful (and fun) work with it."
4,Works on Linux too,"I picked this tablet up at a yard sale for $10. After installing the ""WizardPen"" drivers on my Linux machine (Ubuntu 10) and rebooting, it works much like a regular mouse. I've sketched a bit in GIMP and it works fine. Further, with a little practice it can be used as a primary pointing device, although I still prefer my wireless mouse for normal point-and-click usage."
4,Does it's job,The DigiPro 640 does it's job. It's my first drawing tablet that I have ever used and feel it's a good starting point for me. I'm using the DigiPro 640 with my Mac. I'm running Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and it works well with all my applications. I have used it just fine with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
3,"Works fine with Windows 8, but has problem with Mac","There is software included which allows you to use the pen driver in either a PC or a Mac, but the writing and drawing software can only be used with the PC. I have been looking for updated software, but have found no support site."
2,Actual product different from what you'll receive,"The actual item is different than what is pictured here. The actual item is more like a mouse pad material. Overall, it's inexpensive, and feels that way too. It works, but just don't think it will hold up long. Returned it for a full refund."
1,DOA,"quite honestly this purchase was a mistake. The pad does not work, and i tried all the tricks to make it work that I have found online. I could not find any real store from the seller, all they did for contact infor was route me to amazon returns. I guess it is hard to provide customer service, but at least give an email to you, where it is easy to find.in short, do not buy it. Anything priced at more than $15 should work when you get it, and not have a chance of never working at all.this thing does not even deserve the one star I had to give it."
1,Haven't been able to install it yet.,I have tried at least 5 times to install it with no success. The software installs just fine. But the tablet no workey. Thanks for the paperweight.
1,No Effing Instructions?,"I have no idea how it might work. I can't get it to work, and my time has value. Printed documentation is a single page for a different model. The CD has info for several models, none of which are the one I bought, and the online stuff is a joke. (How effing difficult or expensive would it have been to add instructions to the CD -or put them online for that matter.)Unless you enjoy wasting you time puzzling out how to install / use things, buy another company's product(s). This one is going back for a refund."
2,"Interesting, but not very helpful","Basic information that anyone with some maturity should already know. If you are young without any experience, it may help out."
2,Great title but few real practical hints.,"It reminded me of all the diet books that have come and gone over the years. This technique of frugality worked for this author and his family. Readers need to understand that you have to want something first. Once you do, almost any method will work. Just another mediocre how-to book."
3,Reinforced my intention.,"Most of the material in this book was stuff I already knew. It reinforced my intention to proceed with my lifestyle choices, and there were a couple of tips that will save me much more money than the cost of the book. It badly needs updating, though."
3,"This is for the person that once had decent money, but doesn't now.","If you were middle class (making 40 to 60k a year min.) and worried about your job, this is the book for you. If you make less than 40k a year pass this up."
4,Not bad,The book has some good ideals in it. I do not believe that the writer could live without a salary. This is worth a read.
4,Helpful suggestions for anyone wanting to save money.,"Although the author makes it clear that his method of being frugal is not for everyone, he does succeed in altering our way of thinking about our needs, wants and how we spend money. It comes down to being creative and confident to pursue a dream of financial freedom. An excellent choice."
3,Great for Canadians,"This book is something of a classic. However, he really does not address the serious issue of health care. Canada and some other countries have nationalized health care--maybe not the greatest, but something's better than nothing.Anyone can get along by freelancing or working minium wage jobs if they have their health, and/or cheap insurance. Unfortunately, in the US, relatively fair-priced insurance is only available through better jobs, working full-time. No taking off work any time you feel like it to fly to the Continent.Good book, but not necessarily for frugal types from the US."
2,Battery problems (as usual for Creative),"The battery, which is claimed by Creative to last ""up to"" 7 hours, lasts about 2 hours. So, if you need this gadget for hiking or such, be sure to carry extra batteries. I have had similar experience with other Creative devices. Apparently, their marketing department is completely detached from theirengineering teams. Also, when the transmitter and the headphones are less that 1 foot apart, there are noise and interruptions. Other than that, the headphones are OK, I guess. Given my experience, I would probably not have bought them, but I am too lazy to return."
2,Bulky! not what i hoped for,"after shopping around for wirless headphones for my mp3 player i went with the creative digital wireless headphones, i have a creative labs zen touch mp3 player. the headphones themselves are bulky and fit really funny, they do not stay on your head unless you are sitting very still. the audio sounds great, great bass, but if you are 10 feet or more away from your source yo get a static noise that sounds like a loose cable. for the prce these are ok for indoor use. i returned mine the nxt day i got them, very unhappy with them."
3,Creative Labs Digital Wireless headphones CB2530,"I got a set as a gift. Sound quality is OK, but as an occassional user, I find that the bluetooth connectivity is hit/miss. I have to also agree with other poster comments about the low battery life; I typically seem to have to replace the transmitter battery each time that I want to use the headphones.Lately I have also had a problem with the left channel in the headphones seems to have gone out, so I will likely need to get a warranty replacement."
3,don't leave the room,"I got this for my husband so that either he could listen to his C&W without bothering me or I could watch TV without bothering him. As long as you are in the same room with the bluetooth sender, it's OK. As soon as you try to walk to another room, upstairs, or, Heaven forfend, out to the patio, you can forget it unless you are willing to find exactly the right spot and hold your head at just this angle and are near a doorway (or window if outside). I've not a clue why this is so. I know that my PDA will link to my PC via bluetooth pretty much anywhere in the house. To me that means that the problem is not bluetooth and my walls but the headsets."
2,2nd grade elastic mat'l n short,"While Grizzly makes some good products ( price & performance ) for example : dip belt, but this elbow wrap falls short of expectation - the elastic materials are tough and the length is 6 inches too short of wrap comfortable on the elbow"
2,Didn't do much for me,"While I had heard this oil was great for treating skin fungus, it didn't help at all that I could tell. The smell is ok, but a bit medicine-like."
2,Manuka odor,"Odor is overwhelming. Might be a good product, but didn't get past the smell. You wouldn't want to be around people after application."
5,Best Math Supplement for Preschoolers,"I ordered this book not knowing what it was going to be like. When it got here and I started flipping thru it all that came to my mind is amazing. My son loves this book particulary the star sticker system where the child receives a star for every page it has finished. The pages are set up in a simple manner so your child almost automatically understands what it has to do. The book teaches your child all the math basics from counting to same size, same number, greater , smaller etc. So sit down with your toddler and have fun learning math using this book :D"
2,Nice enrichment activity,This math book was beautiful to look at and seemed nice but it didn't provide incremental expanation and review necessary to actually teach math. A nice summer book for parents who don't want their kids to forget what they have learned. I wouldn't recommend this as a homeschool curriculum.
3,My son had fun with it,"My son really enjoyed completing this workbook and I had to slow him down so he didn't complete it too soon. The pages are nice and thick so he could use a marker where he wanted. I saw two downsides. The first is that most of the pages were quite simple for him, but then there is suddenly a page full of addition with just numbers (no pictures). I let him use manipulatives and didn't make him do all the problems. The other downside is all the drawing. While my son was OK with this, I thought it had the child draw a lot for a K workbook. If your child likes to write and draw the downsides wouldn't be a problem for you. Overall I would do it again."
5,Wonderful for introducing math,"I did this book over the summer with my 4 year old and now she is way ahead of all the kids in her class. It takes things one step at a time. They have stickers in the front of the book so as they do each page, they get a sticker. I motivated my child by letting her know when she finished a row she could by something at the dollar store. They really do ask if they can do a page or two each day. It is not frustrating to try and explain how to do the pages either like some books are. Gradually progresses them to the harder things as they get further in the book."
4,Topic coverage is similar to school,"My 5 year old kindergartner just started using this book today, and she kept wanting to do more pages. The lessons are pretty simple for my daughter so that may be why she loves working with it.The reason I got this book for her was the topics were very similar to what her school teaches, and I wanted her to have more practice. In school, she learns about counting, pattern, sorting, comparison etc which were all covered in this book.I also like that she gets to write out and spell the numbers on writing lines. School has handwriting tests so I wish the book has more line writings but hey, I guess this is a math book after all.My daughter also loves the gold star stickers that came with the book to reward herself for the topics she completed. It's also great that she could color her work afterwards.My only complain about this book is the paper is too glossy. It's a bit more difficult to erase than regular paper although the little one didn't mind it one bit."
1,This game blows!,"This has to be the biggest disapointment ever. I buy this game thinking that it would be really cool, but I was wrong. First of all I'll say that the Graphics arn't bad and that when playing this you feel like you're really in a head-to-head battle with an enemy tank. The thing that really makes me mad is that on the 4th level the game freezes, and you are forced to restart your PC. I tried playing the level over and over again and it always froze at the same spot. Don't buy this game, its not worth it."
3,Could have been better.,"I am a Fitness Professional who is certified with NASM in the CES program. I bought this book to give me a better understanding of the performance enhancement apsects of Optimum Performance Training, however, the exercises and information in this book repeat themselves. Sometimes that is a technique used by authors to demonstrate their importance, but it just gets redundent. This would be a good book for beginners, or someone looking for different exercises to add to their current workout routines. The OPT Model is good and I use it with my clients, but the programs in this book aren't going to get anyone at professional athletic conditioning; they are way too easy. I like the author and NASM, but this book was a disappointment."
1,Do....,"i read this for the historical context of it. i am very fascinated with anything hippie. The is really just a book where the author rants and raves politically but not at all philosophically. it lacks depth and therefore there is nothing to debate.What i did like about the book is that it pushed past boundaries of the times. there is nudity in the book and there are foul words and cussing; words in which one rants and raves with. i believe that was what the author was shooting for was to push past status quo and to encourage strong emotion in the reader through shock tactics, outrageous pictures of nude anarchists of the era, strong language for the blue collar, white supremist, elitist, political government to stand up and take notice of and perhaps see this revolution as a serious militant adversary to contend with."
2,Do What?,"I read this about 4 decades ago, and from what I recall Mr Rubin does a great job at expressing his hatred for all that is sacred, but fails to propose an alternative to what he sees as unjust. As the bible teaches in the book of Proverbs, a rebel has no agenda or solution, he just wants to yell.Jerry Rubin is the poster boy of this type of misfit. You would do well to not spend a dime on this hate book from the self-acclaimed 'love generation' of the 60s."
1,Semiliterate drivel,"In a period marked by genuinely fine revolutionary writing and the birth of Gonzo journalism, Rubin penned a tome so juvenile that it made Dr. Seuss look like adult reading. Garbage."
4,Jules Verne,"Learn about Jules Verne's life growing up and how he joined a secret society. His novels were about the Freemasons and had secret, occult, and Gnostic ideas in them. He had a secret he could not share with anyone and he destroyed all his diaries, papers and documents before he died. His led a fascinating life."
4,Interesting hidden messages,"With the remade Journey to the Center of the Earth soon to be in theaters, I thought it was a great time to take a look into the life and inner-workings of Jules Verne. He was so far ahead of his time that he was intimidating to some who lean towards the more simple and clear-cut. The reputed hidden messages ranging from hidden treasure to sex continue to interest and plague Verne enthusiasts. Great movie, interesting and well worth your time!"
4,A fascinating life,Having been a fan of Jules Verne's work I watched this video with great interest. Some of the greatest works of art come from tortured souls and this seems to be the case here. From a troubled childhood to secrets he took to his grave this video gives great insight into the man behind the masterpieces.
1,Complete waste of time!,"Dear god, this is one of the worst things I have watched in a long time. The quality is unbelievably bad. It is utter nonsense with copyright free videos that have nothing to do with most of the narration playing in the background. Do not waste ur money. I threw it out!"
3,Summer Bridge Activities - First Grade to Second Grade,"I am a teacher. I think that this book is perfect for a child that is in need to work on skills he/she has not mastered yet because it has so many pages! A child who has worked hard and has suceeded first grade does not need so much exercise. Besides pictures are boring and no reading guides are provided. ""Summer Smarts"" has fewer pages, activities are funny and related to a first grader's experiences. And it provides guided reading at the end of the book. However I would strongly suggest "" Summer Bridge"" to a child who has struggled during first grade and/or to a child who has not mastered basic skills yet."
3,Summer Bridge Activities - First Grade to Second Grade,"I would recommend this book to those first graders who still need to learn basic skills. It provides a great deal of practice in any basic skills taught in first grade and those needed to advance to second grade. However it requires about one full hour of work daily, which I think it's too much for a vacationing child who worked hard throughout the school year and obtained good marks.Besides it does not provide worksheets for any book even though there's a list of good reading books on one of the first pages. Another bad point of this workbook is the layout which is rather dull and will not attract the eye of your child. For those average to advanced first graders I would suggest a book like ""Summer Smarts"" which provides less practice in a more kid-friendly layout."
3,Good for 2 years,This vacuum worked well for almost 2 years but now needs to be replaced. We used it maybe once a week.
1,Don't Buy This,"I recently purchased this vacuum cleaner. I paid $50+ for it and the shipping was $49. First of all, I didn't realize the shipping would cost as much as the item I purchased. The first time I tried this vacuum cleaner it didn't work. It wouldn't pick up anything. There was just no suction at all. I haven't sent it back because of the high cost of the shipping. If I sent it back I would end up paying $100 for nothing (shipping). I would tell everyone to never buy this awful product! Better yet, never buy a vacuum cleaner from the internet! IT'S A BIG RIP OFF!"
4,Gives higher end vacuums a run for their money,"I am so impressed and actually surprised at how well this vacuum performs. It is so light you don't expect it to be so poweful. suction is great. Really picks up pet hairs well and vacuums bare floors well. The plastic housing does like a toy though, but what do you expect for $59. However, it does not operate well. As long as they keep making this vacuum there is no need to spend money on a $300 vacuum. This awesome. I did not give it 4 stars because the electrical cord and the hose are very short compared to most vacuums."
1,wouldn't know,"I purchased one that had a damaged package or had to be repackaged. What I received was parts hastily thrown into a huge box, no padding, no invoice , a torn vacuum bag, ripped instructions and it was barely taped closed. After putting it together I discovered 3 pieces were missing, extension wands and a dusting brush. I tried to contact amazon to get them send to me the parts, sent emails and searched their site for someway to communicate the issue. This proved fruitless and had to settle on returning the product. I disassembled the vacuum and mailed it back. Such a waste of time and money. Definitely not a great experience, Amazon. You should have a talk with whoever packaged and checked the parts, poorly done whoever!"
1,lasted two months,We had this vacuum for two months and it stopped working. Can't wait to take it apart to see what is wrong.
2,Started off well... then nosedived.,"This worked very well for the first 6 months, since we were in a small apartment with very little carpeting (and we relied on a swiffer for the tile). Started to get a little less effective at about the one year point, but not too bad. Now we're at the 18 month point, and it has to go. We've tried everything... and yes, we've replaced and cleaned around the bag... but this Hoover just keeps dropping dirt. Instead of sucking it up, it combines the dust and dirt into clumps that are randomly shot around your floor.Initially we were really excited because of how well this was rated, and how it performed in consumer magazines. But it sounds like Hoover kept the model number while diminishing the production quality -- and as soon as ""it's a shiny new vacuum!"" effect wore off, we realized that the Tempo Widepath was not worth our time."
4,Awesome product,"This vacuum works very good. I don't understand why people would give negative rating of this product. The suction works as good as the filter kinds. It saves you at least a 100-200 dollars compare to those so called ""new models with advance features"". The look is not as great as all the new design out there. But it is so simple that you won't be unable to assemble the parts. Make sure to use the attachment to clean the edges and corner of the house. Trust me. This product will satisfy your needs."
4,Good sweeper,I Bought this product because we have lots of pet hair and Consumer Reports rated it as excellant for that purpose. It certianly does that job. It also is very reasonably priced compared to other vacs that got the same rating. Only draw-back is the cord is shorter than my previous vac.
5,Ugly Duckling beats the best,"It is true. This vacuum is ugly, made of cheap plastic and sounds harsh... But at the same time it works better than some more expensive machines out there. The motor is very strong, great on any carpet. It is light and easy to carry around. Replacement bags are cheap and easy to find. This is an excellent value... If you are not considering high end vacuums like Miele, this is the way to go..."
1,Horrific - worst vacuum I have ever owned,"There is no way this vacuum could have deserved the positive rating consumer reports gave it. Even for its low price, it is not worth it. Simply does not work; belts come off and break, are hard to find; had to order from Sears parts department website. I will not buy another Hoover product, and will research to find out who actually makes it so that I don't buy any products made by the same OEM."
4,"Love it, want another one!","Pros:Bagged! As someone with pretty bad allergies, I know that a bagged vacuum almost always wins out over a bagless when it comes to rereleasing dust into the air. But for some reason, the bagless craze (which is all about convenience) has made it pretty difficult to find a good, inexpensive bagged vacuum. But this is one!Price! This is a VERY inexpensive vacuum for the quality of product. I bought my first one a year ago, and it is still going strong. When my downstairs vacuum dies, I plan to replace it with another one of these.Power! Plenty of suction, and I have 3 dogs, 2 cats, and a kid to clean up after. This thing does the trick.Cons:The cord is too short. I wish it had a longer cord because in my huge family room, I do have to unplug it and move it to get the entire room vacuumed.The hose is too short. I cannot read my 10-foot ceilings even with the attachments, and my other vacuum can. Improving these two points would make this the perfect vacuum."
5,Buy this Vacuum,"I seldom write reviews. I felt that I needed to here. This is by far the best vacuum i have had to date and by far the cheapest. i only bought it because consumer reports had it in their top three picks and amazon reviews were very good. I've had an orek for a few years and hated-- hated it! I paid a lot of money for it so I felt married to it. This time I thought I would give this a try. It was inexpensive so if i hated it, I would figure i got what I paid for and learn a lesson. Well I got what I paid for an d much more. The suction is great. Easy set up. i could go on. Let me say this. it is 100% better than my orek and less than 1/4 of the price. Don't hesitate."
1,Broke after 4 uses,"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this product. The first time I used the Hoover, it worked like a dream. My carpet looked almost brand new! I was so impressed and very grateful for all of the positive reviews that encouraged me to take a chance on this affordable product.Well, my attitude changed after I noticed that after only 4 uses, the vacuum stopped sucking up the dirt and debris. My change bag light was not lite, but I decided to replace the bag anyway. All of the dust and dirt continued to get caked up inside the vaccum cleaner and NO dirt was being filtered into the new bag.I am very disappointed. Now I'm going to have to spend the money to have this shipped back to the Hoover for a replacement.Buyer Be Aware!!"
2,Wouldn't get another one,"Bought this in July 2008 and the agitator is already broken. I have no pets and my house is all tile except for two area rugs so there's no way it was overworked. What I really didn't like was the hose, the suction was great, but it made the hose less flexible and harder to extend fully when using attachments making the unit very cumbersome to use. If you assume I got a lemon, and all you're going to use it for is the floor or rug, then it's great; otherwise I'd continue shopping."
5,Great Vac,"Excellent product for an excellent price. If this product fails I wouldconsider buying another for this price! No reason at all to pay $200, $300, or a ridiculous amount for a capable vac. p.s. I have 3 children!"
2,Great except for two things...,"We love the weight and the price but two things drive us nuts.1) That blue, plastic front panel constantly falls off. Touch it, it falls off...hit something and it falls off. I finally used duct tape.2) We've had to replace the belt countless times. It does not break, it just comes off. Then you have to undo the bottom to refasten.These are easy fixes for Hoover...or so it would seem.But it is light and does a good job."
2,disappointed,Bought this vacuum 2 years ago. When i got it i loved it. Great suction power but then about a year in i notcied that the suction was not as good as it was when i first bought it. in two years i replaced 4 belts and filter twice. the hose was mangaled and non-fixable. now it won't even pick up the dirt. I took it apart to clean it and the dirt was everywhere inside but in the bag where it should be.. I did a lot of research on uprights and heard so many good reviews on this vacuum when i first bought it. I thought it would last longer then 2 years... boy was i wrong.
4,An Apartment Dweller's Dream,"My last vacuum was a Bissell Cleanview II that lasted for 3 years. Everything with it was great except when I had to empty it. Emptying the dirt cup and cleaning the filters sent dust falling all over the vacuum and going in the air. After that I decided to get a bagged model. I did some research and the Hoover Tempo Widepath looked like a great buy. And after using it I'll say it's a great vacuum for apartments or other small living spaces.It's low cost, but has great suction and is pretty lightweight. Plus it has a nice compliment of attachments and the bags are not expensive. The main downside with it is the obvious low cost parts. Specifically with the hose, attachments and lack of a headlight (it would have been worth paying $10-20 more for better materials). It wouldn't be appropriate for a regular size house and probably won't last more than a couple years. However, for the price it's a terrific buy."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum,"Great vac for the price!!! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I've had to change the bag before it was full because it smells like dog hair (we have a large dog and he sheds terribly!). So, I'm not sure if it's the vac or the excessive dog hair that makes the bag smell before it's full. Nonetheless, Hoover makes a good vacuum. Thumbs up!"
3,Good for low price,"fairly easy to assemble move about but negatives are that it is fairly loud, the suction hose on the back is too short and hard to connect/disconnect to use the tools. I was disappointed to find the same model $30 cheaper in a local store after I purchased this one online"
4,Decent Vacuum Short Hose,"I bought this about 4 years ago. I use it only about once a week just for couple of rooms as my cleaners do the cleaning every other week. It has been working fine. Just one problem that it has a very short flexible hose and even using the hard extension pipes it is not long enough for many tasks. Belt got broken couple of times. Construction is not very sturdy but if you are not doing heavy lifting it is a good value. I like the on/off switch location, lifting handle, lightness, and bag indicator."
3,A good vacuum for the price,"While the vacuum does a good job on carpet and bare floors, the coil part of the hose is very rigid. When using attachments, the connecting hose pieces invariably come off with the slightest movements up and down steps or reaching up. It's very frustrating. For that reason, I don't know that I would buy it again."
1,Do not buy this vacum- Poorly made,"This is not your old American made Hoover upright we all know. This machine is made by the lowest bidder and it shows. I have had nothing but problems with mine. The attachments do not stay on the machine, the vibration is awful, and the worst of it is this loud growling noise from the motor that started a month after we bought it. Hoover defintely cut corners in the manufacturing process in keeping the price down. Mission accomplished! You made a shiney blue piece of junk. Go to your local used vacuum store (if you can find one) and pick up an older refurbished Hoover. You will be way ahead."
1,CRUDE & BLASTING LOUD Tempo also does serious damage.,"I skimped and bought this after my $600 Dyson Animal died after 3 years.Buying this model is a Major, costly mistake.This is a Basic very crude vacuum that's intensely Loud and blows out tons of heat - but the big damaging issue is that even on it's highest carpet setting it's stillfar too low and burns and shreds carpet edges - it wasn't until months later I realized what was happening to my good carpet. When my neighbor borrowed it, she quicklynoticed this defect, much faster than I. It also now sparks when turned on, the bag cover constantly pops off, the hoses pop out of place frequently. Just a pain.It's the cheapest vacuum out there with 1925 technology, it's just not even worth $25.The damage it's done to all the edges of my carpet is costly. Do yourself and your carpets a favor - avoid this crude damaging vacuum."
2,Very Disappointed,Didnt receive on time. When I did finally get my vacuum after 2 days of use the hose kinked up with just regular use. I bet a lot of hoses are sold!! Im just gonna use mine now til it breaks down. This has been my first time ordering a vacuum online and my last. Way to much hassle!!!! I dont even know how to get a new hose without paying for it.
3,3-year lifespan,"When I bought this Tempo 3 years ago, it had great suction and a great price. That's all I thought I needed in a vacuum. But now I would add one more requirement to the perfect vacuum -- longevity. A couple weeks ago, I noticed a burning smell (which has basically gone away) and now the suction is bad. I go over and over the same spot trying to encourage it to pick up lint or cat hair."
4,Mostly good but a couple bad features,"This vacuum, purchased a couple months ago, is a good buy for the money. It has great suction power! It is fairly lightweight and I don't mind the cheaper plastic. But the handle is difficult for me to grasp without discomfort. And the place where you store the cord is nothing short of awful. The top loop it goes on is not stationary & keeps giving way, allowing the cord to unravel all over the floor. There's no easy way to store the cord! The vacuum seems to have some sort of self propelled thing going on, and while it may be helpful going forward, when you pull the vacuum back, it tends to drag more than it should. It's a bit too wide for me. I don't like it not being able to fit between chair legs, etc.However, when you consider the low price and the great suction power combined with the lightweight feel, it's not bad! No vacuum will give you ever feature and style you like. I'm satisfied with it overall."
4,Moves...,"This vacuum MOVES by itself. It is so easy to use and since it covers such a widepath, it is easy to get all my vacuuming done in no time. It was very simple to put together and was shipped nicely. Thank you for offering this at such a great price. Consumer Reports rates this a one of the best bagged vacuum's for under $100."
4,For the money a great cleaner but here's a tip,If you have long haired humans in your house check the beater brush frequently. Hair will wrap around the brush and it will build up on the ends of the brush. I had a huge hair build up on one end that caused the end to seize and heat up and melt. A replacement will cost about $25.
2,okay,"This a very lightweight vaccum, which I love, but one flaw-It makes too much noise than the ordinary vaccum. The hose frequently comes off when I'm vacumming the stairs. Ugly blue color-retro style."
4,Hard to beat for the price,"Very good vacuum for the price. Not as efficient as my old windtunnel vac, but at 1/3 the price this light weight vacuum is a great buy."
2,"Heavy, cumbersome and hard to use",I bought this vacuum because of the price and because of the reviews. A lot of people said they loved it and for the money thought it was a real value. I didn't. It's extremely hard to use - the suction doesn't work on certain surfaces.
4,The hose is too short,"This is the 3rd Tempo that I have purchased in 10 years, I put a lot of miles on these vacuums, 30 minutes a day and run them to death. I love a bagged vacuum and you can't beat this for the price, the long cord is a bonus too. The most recent one that I purchased came with a hose that is just a smidge too short and I am constantly stopping to pop it back in. I should have saved my old one, but it went out to garbage in the new box. Overall, I would recommend this product."
1,Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum,"I bought this Vacuum cleaner on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is too heavy for my wife to push, and worse, it does not vacuum very well. It has trouble picking up little pieces such as paper or string. When I vacuum the wooden floor in my den, I have to go over the area twice in order for this vacuum cleaner to pick up all of the dust. The clamp that holds the bag is a bit tricky to click open and close. The setting for height for carpet/floors is very difficult to move between settings. it constantly gets stuck and it requirs a lot of force to move the setting. This product is also very noisy. After using this thing for about one year, we're going to buy another brand and put this clunker in a closet or give it away."
4,Great value,This vacuum has SUCTION! It's great and powerful. We use them a lot. The only downside (loss of one star) is that the attachments/accessories are below par. Not ergonomic and don't hold up well. The vacuum is overall a GREAT value for only around $80.
4,"Great vacuum, great value","So far I really like this vacuum. I purchased it after reading the great reviews and looking at consumer reports. Also, the price is incredible! I would suggest buying this vacuum. I don't really like having to purchase vacuum bags since my last vacuum was bagless but that is only a minor complaint considering the purchase price."
2,Lemon?,"I bought this model vacuum due to it's high rating from consumer reports. Ironically, in the three months I have had it, it has suffered two broken belts (changing the belt is no easy task, either!). It took three weeks for Hoover to deliver the first replacement belt, so it has probably been out of action as long as it has been working. When it works, it is great. I just wish it worked more often."
2,Belt Broke on First Usage,"I guess it's a good vaccuum -- I don't know. The belt broke on the first usage. Also, the darn thing had to be assembled when it arrived and the instructions were very reliant on the drawings in the manual -- but the drawings weren't clear. In fact, they were confusing. And be prepared to use a screwdriver.As for the vaccuuming, I'll be able to tell better when I get the belt replaced. At this point, I'm sure you'll understand when I say I'm not very impressed."
2,uuummm the hose???,i needed a vacuum that had a hose so that i could vacuum the stairs. This hose is so short and the attachments make it way too hard to do stairs. If you need vacuum that does duel function do not get this one. It does work well as a regular vacuum but the hose is a joke and does not work!!
3,"Great suction, not much else","This vacuum has the best suction I have seen in this price range. However, the extension hose does not extend at all. Having no light on the vacuum bothers me more than I thought it would. For straightforward vacuuming, the suction can't be beat. Otherwise, this vacuum is what one would expect for the price."
1,Buying different vacuum after only 1.5 years,"I usually own vacuums for about 15 years on average. This one I'm getting rid of after 1.5 years. I hate it. The brushes continue to spin when using the hand tools and it put a hole in my rug. The cord doesn't stay locked in the channel up the back of the vacuum, so it effectively attaches at the base of the vacuum and I continually run over the cord. The hose is short. I spent the money for the separate extra long hose, but the vacuum tips over whenever I use it because it is too heavy for the vacuum. This vacuum is cheap and it has alot of suction power, but I can't say much else positive about it."
4,Quite Good!,"We bought thie Hoover after our vacuum finally gave out. We were a little hesitant to buy such an inexpensive vacuum, but we figured with the Hoover 1 year warranty, we would give it a chance. So far, so good. Our only complaint is the slightly short cord and the way it is located on the machine is a little awkward. Otherwise, we are pleased."
3,okay for the money,"This is an inexpensive vaccuum, which Hoover has designed on purpose (their product registration survey asks if you appreciate ""giving up features in exchange for a low-priced product"" or something to that effect). As such, this is a fine vaccuum for the money.Alas, I gave up on mine after only about 2 years. The hose is quite short and stiff. I purchased the extended hose, which is very long and much more flexible, and even left it mounted on the vacuum full-time, although this was a bit awkward because it flopped around. The lever that adjusts from the height of the brush can be a bit difficult to slide. Mine simply lost suction power.However, I am now using my mother's Hoover Tempo, which is a slightly different (older) model. It has a much nicer hose: softer and stretchier) and so far is working just fine. Well, it is after I replaced the belt, which burned up, apparently due to excess hair being wrapped around the roller brush?"
4,Good value,Powerful little vacumn. I like that it is lightweight and easy to carry. The cord could be at least a foot longer.
3,Shopping for a new vac after 4 years,"I am on Amazon today reading vacuum reviews because I am tired of fighting with this Hoover. It was fine when it was new, but after a year or two we have serviced it both in shop and at home and the darn thing just doesn't work. Right now the belt keeps slipping off. We are not frequent vacuumers, so it hasn't really had heavy use. When it worked well, it was fairly easy to use. I can't testify to how much dirt it picked up, like so many people, but I have used some poor vacuums and this one did seem to pick up well when it was newer. I'm going to spend more money this time and hope to get something that lasts!"
4,Best Ever for Pet Hair,"I've owned this vacuum for the last 2 yrs, just bought one for my daughter-in-law. With 5 cats, pet hair has long been my biggest issue with vacuum cleaners. After reading the CR review, I took a chance.This picks up pet hair better than ANY vacuum I've ever owned, including my $400 Miele. The only downside is that it's not self-propelled, but it has so much suction that it almost feels as though it is. It really does pull forward without much effort at all.If it were truly self-propelled, I'd give it 5 stars."
4,Great vacuum for the price!,"I am no vacuum expert, but the vacuum works well. It is among the highest rated vacuums by Consumer Reports and it costs hundreds less than the comparable models (although it is not recommended which I don't understand). It is made of plastic and it is not fancy, but it seems to do its job well. I would buy it again. The delivery from Amazon was faster than I expected."
4,good vac,It sucks in a great way - is light and easy to maneuver. Only problem is when optional tools fall off when not in use. still overall would buy again.
4,A bit loud,"This vacuum does a pretty good job of picking up animal hair and is very light (my 12-year old daughter has no problem lifting it up). The downside is that it is very noisy and, in the case of animal hair, sometimes pushes the hair away from the vacuum (you sort of have to chase it down)."
5,Great Quality why buy more ?,This vacuum has served us very well. IT vacuums great and is excellent at picking up kids food. One of my favorite things about it is that it rarely sucks up the end of the carpet and jams itself.If you are noticing decreased performance I have found that usually means the bag is full.It was a great price and meets all of our needs I don't know why you would spend more it's not necessary
3,Just average,"I would give this vacuum an average rating. It seems to pick up well, but it leaves unsightly tracks from the wheels and roller brush on the carpet. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this vacuum as my main one, maybe only as a spare for my basement. It was inexpensive though, so you do get what you pay for."
4,"So far, so good","I've only used the vacuum twice but both times was impressed by its suction power and ease of handling. I found it easy to assemble. My two previous vacuums were canister models so I'm still adjusting to the change. For the price, I think it's a keeper."
4,Hoover Tempo,"It works great, good suction. The on/off switch is located on the body instead of the handle. This makes you reach down to stop, which is not good in tight spaces. With one hand holding the handle and the other holding the cord, you can suck up the wrong things easily. The cord does not go up high on the handle, it is high on the body so you have to hold in one hand to keep it out of the way. You have to assemble the handle to the body when it arrives. No big deal, but you can tell that Hoover is saving a few bucks on assembly and shipping size which results in a inconvenient switch and cord. It is light weight and handles well. I got a great price on Amazon.com."
3,Mixed Opinion,"The vacuum cleans up really well... But, it is all cheep plastic. It would be great for a small apartment without kids or animals. It is an inexpensive machine so I was expecting ad ""disposable"" vacuum anyway. I just thought the parts would last for more than six months. My biggest complaint is that the hose is very, very cheep. It bends so that it blocks all suction and it stays that way even after the vacuum is turned off. It just needs a better hose."
2,Blows dust up not in the bag.,"Hi, I never write reviews but when my husband noted the same problem I had wished someone would have written a review about this.When vacuuming on hard wood floors the vents from the motor blows all the dust and bird feathers around the room before you get a chance to vacuum them up.And the cord is to short. Nowhere in this ad does it say the cord length , I didn't know the length of my last vacuums cord , but I guess it was long enough, This machine is not."
4,Amazing power for the price,"This vacuum is a hidden gem! I researched in Consumer Reports and nearly passed this one by on Amazon. I figured, wrongly, that it's low price meant low quality. Thank you to all that took the time to review this product! The suction is amazing, especially with the cleaning tools. I easily vacuumed all the cat hair off my furniture - and I mean all. The only thing that the vacuum is missing is for my personal preference = a longer attachment hose for the tools. I intend to order one from the form that came enclosed in the box. You can't go wrong with this vacuum, especially with it being shipped from Amazon to your door in a matter of a few days!"
2,doesn't work on bare floors,"i did my research and read a lot of good reviews for this vacuum. i really wanted to like it, especially for the price, but it doesn't work on bare floors.i don't have carpet but wanted a good affordable vacuum for the floors and upholstery. i really needed the vacuum to be able to pick up fine particles and sadly, fleas - i'm waging a war on fleas even though my cat stays indoors. it's extremely hot and humid here and fleas just thrive. part of the flea treatment was to sprinkle salt on the floor and vacuum it up. the vacuum didn't pick it up, and just spread it around at high velocity - i could feel the particles hitting my feet and ankles. very disappointing.it seems to work pretty well on upholstery, though to pick up pet hair, you need to use the 'duster' brush and not the upholstery attachment."
5,Little Powerhouse!,"My biggest concern when buying a vacuum was the machine's ability to suck up pet fur. I have a hairy beast of a dog and when she sheds it's very frustrating trying to get it all picked up.This vacuum already had 1100+ reviews when I purchased it. Based on those reviews, I was confident it would do the job and the price was more than fair.It puts together easily. It's not too heavy. And it sucks up everything! It pulled me the first time I used it. It's pretty powerful.I hate bagless vacuums. I think they are messy and too difficult to clean. I was happy to go back to buying bags. Some have said the bag is hard to find for this model, but I found them in my local Target.Changing the bag was easy and I had no problems with dirt and dust escaping when I pulled the bag out.I've only had it a month, but I am so happy with it. I highly recommend it."
4,Good vacuum,"After a few uses this Hoover vacumm is doing a much better job than my old Eureka. I'd have given it five stars, but I wish it had better side suction, and occasionally when I'm pushing and pulling this vacuum (normal use)....it langs and it's like one of the wheels is locking up...I'm not yet sure what this could be. Then after a few pushes and pulls it's back to normal. But bottom line and all in all I recommend ths vacuum!"
1,What a rip off,This can not be the model that consumer reports recommended. It is very cheaply made and does not pick up near as well as my old machine. I empty the dirt collector on my old machine after vacuuming each room due to cat hair that is collected. This machine barely had anything in the bag after I vacuumed my whole house. The belt broke the first time I used it. I am returning it as soon as I can get it shipped out.Don't buy it.
5,"It's hard to get excited about a vacuum, but this one is boss","The top reviewer may be right about there being no bells and whistles on it, but dang if this vacuum doesn't suck up pet hair like it's going out of style. If you want a good, affordable vacuum (and I have had some really bad affordable ones), this is your man. Or thing. It's been durable so far - I've had it for four months and I am a very tidy person, so I use it a lot. The bag replacements are affordable too and all the attachments are really useful. It's not a trendy vacuum, but I am not inviting my friends over to look at my vacuum. What they do see is a clean floor. And that's what's up."
3,Vac.Review,"I am kind of spoiled in that my last vacuum had a light, which I miss on this model. The main problem we have encountered is that small round items are not picked up, but thrown behind the machine. We have nearly all bare floors. On the few few throw rugs the vacuum works well."
5,Great deal for the price!,"Read all the reviews and did research before purchasing. True it is loud, but it does a great job. No problems. I really like it."
4,Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath,"Excellent machine for the price. We have gone through at least one vac a year, over the last several years due to dog hair mainly from our Great Pyrenees. Nothing we've tried picks up the hair better, and that includes vacs like the Dyson, Oreck etc. The only downside is the bags don't hold a housefull of dirt and dog hair. However, this machine does the job more than adequately and might even last longer than a year. Even if it doesn't it beats paying 3 or 4 hundred $ a year for a vac that only pics up half the dirt and hair. The beater also needs less cleaning than the other more expensive types. Highly recommend this affordable workhorse.Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum"
3,Considerable disappointment,"The machine is far too unwieldy., The hose attachment is too rigid; its limited flexibility makes it all but impossible to keep it attached to the machine. A real nuisance and a significant obstacle to the machine's use.On the positive side, it seems to have a great deal of drawing power, too much, though, to make it safe for use on small area rugs.But a good buy for the price."
3,"Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, Bagged",Product is cheaply made. I only used it a couple of times. It is very loud too. I would not highly recommend this item.
5,This is my second,"This is my second purchase of a widepath Hoover this year for my home. Now I have an upstairs and a downstairs vacuum. This price was less ,money and entire purchase was much easier than going to a store."
3,Good value,"I have used this for several months, now. No problems. I like the way I can access the attachments without reformatting the vaccuum. It seems to not pull straight unless I am vaccuuming with the nap of the carpet, but that may be a quirk with the carpet (new house.)"
4,Giant Eating Machine,"Finally I got my replacement order today. This machine is GIANT, and eats everything it can catch. As some review said, it is a little hard to draw it back since it rolls forward automatically. It even ate my husband's cellphone charge, so be careful - it really eats everything! By the way, the wire is a little hot after it finished brushing all the carpet floor(1br in my case). The noise is also big and we couldn't hear each other when it was in use."
4,Great job but noisy!,"It's great considering everything. Strong enough to eat everything but noisy too. The additional tools not located very well and may fall! The wire should be tied to handle or it would make some prob. Anyway, finally good and practical"
4,Very good,"This vacuum is great for the money! There is a lot of sucking power, which we very much appreciate as we have two cats and two dogs. A wheel fell off the first week, but that was easy to fix."
3,Its ok,"I bought this after reviewing it on several sites and consumer reports. It was supposed to be excellent regardless of its inexpensive price. Well, it's ok. I put it on the lowest setting and it still doesnt pick up everything (ie: lint). I would have spent more if I had known. Its ok for a poor grad student like me, but I wouldn't buy it if you have more you can invest."
4,Powerful vacuum at a great price!,"This is a Consumer Reports ""best buy"" machine that I couldn't find anywhere in our local stores. Just before buying something else, I decided to see if Amazon might have access to one. Much to my surprise, they did! The vacuum works very well, and it's light enough that I didn't miss the self-propel feature. Buy one while you can!"
2,Strong but spits debris,"This vacuum is unquestionably cheap and the motor is strong, but it ""spits"" out debris from the beater brush. This problem is especially pronounced on wood floors. I would have returned it to Amazon except I would have had to pay shipping back so it was not worth it. I will be trying to sell this vacuum at a garage sale as soon as I can."
1,Tore up my carpet,"I bought this because Consumer Reports said it was so good. The first time I used it, it immediately began pulling fibres out of my carpet, creating big fluff balls. I returned it the same day."
4,Nice product,"I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and have only used it twice, however it is light, easy to maneuver and the suction seems to be very good. Much better than the older dirt devil i had and also cannot beat the price."
4,Plenty of power,I threw my old vacuum in the garbage after the first time using this vacuum. It's very powerful. Be careful with little rugs and area rugs with fringe. Even the lowest setting will shred the fringe and make a huge mess (I found out the hard way). It definitely has the self-propelled action and comes with everything you need. Very easy assembly and I got it for a great price on Amazon.com. The only reason why I've given it 4 stars is because I'd love a retractable power cord.
4,great vacuum,My last hoover lasted for 7 years and I needed a good replacemant that would work on pet hair and pick up after kids as well as the one before. This one works even better. I don't have to worry about the dog hair being left behind or the food crumbs either. The price is great and it goes every where. I only wish the attachment hose was a little longer but otherwise it is great and I have hopes it will last as long as my last one did.
5,Awesome Product!,I would highly recommend this product. It is an excellent vacuum for the price. It was recommended on Consumer Reports and I purchased it after testing a pricey Dyson. This product is awesome for picking up pet fur.
5,Great Value,"This is an excellent vacuum for carpets. Nothing fancy, it just is easy to manuver and really cleans the carpet. What a value!"
4,Good vacuum for price,"This vacuum works very well. A little heavy, and maybe louder than most, but for the price it works exceptionally well."
3,Good for one-floor carpeted homes,"I've had this for nearly a year now, and it's been the best vacuum I've owned. The suction is great and picks up after every mess I (and my cat) have made. There's a lot of additions that are very useful.The downsides: It's heavy for me (I'm petite). I live in a 2-floor house and my entire 2nd floor is carpeted, whereas only half my 1st floor is carpeted. Carrying that thing up and down the stairs weekly is hard work already. My stairs are also carpeted, and the vacuum is too large to stay on a step without wanting to fall off, which means I have to clean the stairs with one hand and mind the vacuum with the other.It's also quite loud. I can't hear anything -- the phone, the radio, the door -- when it's on.The additions, which are stored on the back, pop off easily."
5,High Value Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum to be the upstairs vacuum, so was looking for a lower cost, good vacuum. So I was very excited to see this one rated very highly in a Consumer magazine at only 70$. Well I have been rewarded with an excellent vacuum. It is very powerful and pulls itself through the carpet and cleans my high pile rugs perfectly. The only drawbacks I have noticed is that the cord is a little short and the tools are just so so but that is probably why they can sell it so cheap.It works better than my other vacuum which cost be almost 300$ and is easier to maintain. I am thinking of ditching my other vacuum for a second one of these. It is a great vacuum."
4,Cat Hair $ The Vacuum,"I had a little trouble puttingthe vacuum together and thediagram was not that good.Having given the negative, once I got it assembled it was wonderful. I have a very long hair cat and it gets up her fur from the carpeting."
4,"Great price, Great vacuum","I hate all the new bagless vacuums, really! I have cats and none of the vacuums seem to work for long. I wanted an ""old fashioned"" upright vacuum with a bag. This had good reviews and a good price. Boy, does it having moving power. It practically vacuums on its own. You do have to be extra careful not to run over items that will be easily sucked into the vacuum! It has the power I wanted and actually picks up dirt. I can use it on floors and stairs. The bags aren't expensive and can be easily found at Target, Walmart or online. I use it a lot and it hasn't gotten clogged or lost sucking power as ALL my 4 other bagless vacuums have."
4,Great Hoover vacuum at a low price,"This is a very efficient vacuum that has a lot of suction. It does a very good job at cleaning in most situations, and it does really well on pet hair. This isn't the end-all vacuum. It doesn't have quite the versatility for comprehensive or heavy duty cleaning--for tool use, the hose is too short and inflexible and the tools are small and cheap. However, for overall carpet vacuuming and minor tool use, it does just fine. Historically, we have not had really good luck with Hoover vacuums hanging in their for extended periods. Our main vacuum these days is a Kenmore canister vac. This new Hoover is serving as a back up to our primary unit and also for when we need really strong suction (e.g., when the dogs track mud into the house, the pet hair is excessive, or we have sand in our RV after camping at the beach)."
2,Broke after 18 months of light use.,"It worked well until the day it died, but it broke after 18 months of very light use (1000 sq ft home with berber carpeting). As a Consumer Reports rated product, I expected it to last a little longer (my last vacuum was a cheap Dirt Devil that I had for 10 years!). The pet hair attachment is awesome but the hose is too short to really use and the extension hose they sell here on Amazon isn't any better. Overall I couldn't really recommend this product. BIG disappointment."
4,Hoover Tempo vacum,very powerful little wide i liked to older material cannister better but for money its pretty good
3,"Great Vacuum, Great Price, Lousy Reliability","I bought this vacuum because it was top rated. I even bought extra belts based on other reviews about it eating belts because I figured a couple of extra belts was worth the savings, especially when the average vacuum costs $200, and this one was $80 including shipping. What I did not expect was to have to replace a bearing in the roller, which quit rolling after only two months. This vacuum works better than any vacuum I've ever used - and I've used plenty, even Kirbys - when it works. If you buy this vacuum, be sure to find out what's required to get warranty service."
4,Great value!,"I bought this vacuum about a year ago after my Panasonic died after years of good service. The power cord is a tad too short and it is pretty loud, but overall this vaccuum performs. This unit picks up dirt like a champ and for the money, you can't go wrong.I personally wouldn't recommend wasting hundreds of dollars on a whiz bang vacuum when this one will do you just fine."
4,"Have only used twice since purchase, but seems good","I've only used the vacuum twice since purchasing it, but it seems good. It seems to have very good suction and seems to retain suction. I think it works great on carpets, but maybe not as well on bare floors -just use the accessory hose and save yourself a headache. Speaking of headaches and the accessory hose; it's short! I have already pulled the vacuum over on my head more times than I care to remember while trying to vacuum under furniture."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this and within a couple months (no more than ten vacuum sessions of less than 400 square feet), it pretty much stopped having suction when used as an upright. There is still good suction with the hose, but that's a pretty impossible way to clean a carpet."
3,"Works, but cheap!","I have had this vacuum for almost two years. I noticed how cheaply made it was right out of the box, but it was lightweight and had good suction. For the first 6-8 months it worked very well. Most of the problems are with the hose. I had to duct tape the hose to the body as it would disconnect. It is also not pliable. It can collapse down and it is hard to reshape for proper suction. The height adjustment feature no longer works. It can also leave dirt under the vacuum when you are using the attachments."
3,You get what you pay for...,"It's a good vacuum for cleaning carpets but tools are pretty much useless because the hose is too stiff, making it really awkward. Bag is easy to change and it is relatively lightweight. Difficult to push on thick pile carpet. Cord is way too short for larger rooms. Build quality is below average to average. The headlight is improved over the previous hoover tempo line. On/off switch is too low and in an awkward location. If you have a good quality handheld this is a good buy otherwise you might want to go with the Eureka all-in-one boss vacs. Should last a couple of years. Overall, a disappointing product for such well-known brand name."
4,Very good bargain,"Excellent product for the price. Six months later, it is still working in top form. I am glad I opted for this instead of a more expensive model. I wish the attachments stayed on the back of the vacuum better though."
2,No Deal After All - Poor Ergonomics and Loud,"Buying this model vacuum without physically examining it was a mistake, even after the 3rd place finish in Consumer Reports, the sub-$80 price, and past good experience with a long-lived Hoover. The first clue was the on/off switch placement, almost half-way down the handle, instead of near the hand grip. The second was the noise, 8dB more than our old Hoover upright. The third was that the shorter power cord exited the vacuum near the floor, so you have to hold it to keep from running over it. The old Hoover's cord exited near the top of the handle and was longer. Fourth, the new machine is harder to push. Last, the new machine is too wide to fit in some places that the old vacuum would. We are going to look again for a new vacuum, but this time we will try it out before buying it. Hopefully, we will find someone local in or out of our family to give the U5140-900 to. It would be cruel to sell it to someone else."
3,Advertised as new from Amazon but I got a used Hoover vacuum!,"This vacuum is advertised as new from Amazon but I got a used Hoover vacuum! Beware that Amazon is shipping used vacuums as new!The bag is on the small side and the unit is noisy.Pros:->Flexible handle position-Handle drops all the way to the floor. Allows you to vacuum under beds, couches, etc.->Good suction via a short hose.->Accessories conveniently stored on vacuum.->Good long cord.Cons:->Difficult to pick up debris near the walls, in corners, etc.->Using powdered carpet freshener decreases suction quality dramatically.This review is after 1 month. I am hopeful the drive belt does not snap after 2 months as the other reviews have indicated!"
5,Love it-Love it-Love it!!,"I absolutely LOVE this sweeper. I even sweep for no reason. I have 2 BIG dogs. Lots of dog hair. It takes it right up and makes the rugs look great!I Don't find it too noisy. My belt did break after a week, but I expected that. NO big deal. I'll stock up on belts. I even ordered 36 bags on line, so expect to have it around for a while. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one. One hint- If the sweeper is hard to push, that probably means the belt broke. So change it right then, so you don't burn out the motor."
3,warning,"The price is great. The vacuum is powerful. However, the dirt that gets sucked up also gets spit right out again from the back. As I am vacuuming with bare feet, my feet get pummeled with the dirt and it stings. Sounds strange, but this has been my experience with the vacuum."
4,nice to have one,"Compared to my old vacuum (I even can't remember its brand), this Hoover vacuum is working much better on both of my wool carpet and wood floor. I was amazed by its powerful suction. One thing I don't like is that this vacuum seems to make a really big noise. My old one is kind of quiet, but probably that's why it doesn't suck well."
3,Hoover Tempo Widepath broke after 3 uses,"I loved my Hoover Tempo Widepath, and I still do, however I feel that their warrantee is a sham. After 3 uses, the lever used to adjust the carpet height came off in my husband's hand. The nearest Hoover approved repair center was 3 hours away, so I had to pay a local shop to have it repaired. Great vacuum, but lousy customer service."
5,GREAT deal,"A good value all around. This is a case of ""what you see is what you get!"" Plain and simple machine, efficient and powerful enough for most home jobs! Fantastic value. To be fair, I am using my old vacuum's hose as an extra extension, as the one provided is short and stiff. But for this price, I'm not complaining.......wonderful suction!"
4,"Good, solid, equipment","This vacuum is light-weight, and it has lots of power! Although it's not self-propelled, it almost seems like it wants to go on its own. It's very reasonably priced and was recommended by a friend. Thankfully, she saved us significant amounts of money since we were considering a Dyson before we purchased this Hoover. We're very pleased."
3,Don't expect to use attachments without buying extension hose,"If you want to use the attachments for cleaning anything, expect to purchase the extention hose. Without it, you can't vaccumn the couch the coffee table, or the tv - because the cord is too short.My mother has a basic Kenmore canister vaccumn which is heads and tails much better. In retrospect, I wish I would have shelled out the $200 for the canister."
5,A best buy for me,"Consumer Reports listed this one as a ""best buy"" and I agree. I bought this when my fancy, expensive 'wind tunnel' vacuum died after being used to clean up after my kitchen was redone. It is lighter, easier to maneuver, and cleans just as well as vacuums costing 4 times as much."
1,horrible,"This vacuum is fine for pushing back-and-forth on carpet, but is prone to high-pitched whining. For tool use, it is terrible. The materials are excessively cheap, the hose is way too short (and does not expand well), the rolling brushes on the bottom do not stop turning while in tool mode, and cause lots of problems. In tool mode, it especially whines with a very irritating high pitch reminiscent of finger nails on a black board. It's cheap, but better to spend a little extra dough and get a proper vacuum. I got this one because Consumer Reports listed it as a best buy, and said it cleans great for the money. I'd steer clear."
2,Not so great vaccuum,"After reading the positive reviews, I was certain this affordable vacuum was going to be great. It turned out to be a disappointment.The suction on the floor is rather poor. It's obvious that it leaves a lot of small and large particles and pet hair behind. The hose and tools work well for spot-cleaning, but that's really about it. It's nice and lightweight for carrying up and down stairs. But the inconvenience of buying and changing the bags was a drawback after using a bag-less model.Depending on your cleaning needs, I would recommend spending a little more for a higher quality model."
2,Big Disappointment,"After reading all the reviews, this sounded like a good buy, and I was prepared to change the belt as needed.But I'm finding that it just doesn't pick up what's on the carpet or bare floor; after repeated passes on carpet, only about 50% of the visible debris has been removed, not just relocated. It's about the same on my laminate floors. Also, it's almost impossible to get the little tab that adjusts the height to stop anywhere in the middlerange: it just snaps from bare floor to high pile."
1,Had for ONE day and stopped working,"I researched a bunch of vaccums and found one with good reviews so I took a chance and bought it online. Boy, was that a mistake! When it arrived, my wife started using it in our living room. Once she went out to do around the dining room table, it stopped picking up anything. We checked the bag and all of the suction vents, and EVERYTHING was clear. We didn't even have it for 24 hours. I was at the post office the next day to return it.Some positives were the shipping time was fantastic. The return policy and procedure was also hassle free."
5,This vacuum sucks! (In a good way!!),"I shopped around for a long time before buying this vacuum. I was so surprised to have found such an outstanding quality product for such a great price. It has incredible suction power! I have bought several vacuums and have paid well over $500 for some, and none of them have ever been as good as this one. I have all hardwood and tile floors, but I do have rugs, which is why I wanted an inexpensive upright. (I hate canister vacs, which is what I use on the hard surfaces.) We have a stone surrounding the wood burning stove, and it is great for getting all the dust and dirt out of the crevices. All of the tools and attachments are excellent and help me greatly for cleaning ceiling fans, vent covers, etc. I highly recommend this vacuum. It's the very best one I have ever owned, and I've gone through a lot! I also have 2 dogs that shed a lot, so it is more than capable of handling the job better than any other! I am extremely pleased with it."
1,Barely acceptable,"I've owned this vacuum for a little over two years now and after initially giving this a 3 star review, it now deserves a zero. What a total piece of garbage. No matter what floor height setting I put it on, it won't pick up ANYTHING. I've replaced the bag, I've checked the hose for clogs. It's just a weak, pitiful vacuum. The hose attachment has solid suction, but unless you are going to go around your entire house with the hose attachment to the floor, don't bother getting this pile. For the cost and effort, I'm not going to attempt to get it fixed or looked at. It's going straight to the trash pile and I'll never buy a Hoover again. There was a little tiny ball of cat hair on my carpet. I went over it a dozen or so times and it didn't pick it up. Not sure if it ever did any good. Regardless, I strongly encourage you to get a different product."
5,Great Vacuum works well on all surfaces,"Thanks to Consumer Reports for recommending this gem. The suction is amazing, even with the accessory tools. The pet-hair removal is also effective. I'm also impressed at the very clean discharge air which is a challenge for any vacuum.Wish List: Would like a more extendable slinky-type hose. Also would like a control that could shut off the brushes when using hand tools. This would lend itself to a seperate motor for the brush which would eliminate belt problems. I realize both of those features would add to the cost - perhaps they could offer a deluxe version of the same basic unit that includes those features. I would pay a little more for those features, provided the basic performance of the vacuum isn't reduced.CU tested many vacuums in this report, some costing several times more than this unit. Although many offer more features, very few matched the performance of this unit on a variety of surfaces and for pet hair extraction - plus clean discharge air."
4,Hoover Tempo Great Value,"We have been through three vacuum cleaners in the past year; from $125 to over $300. One clogged up constantly. Another was too loud. Another, too heavy to carry up and down the stairs. For the price, the Hoover Tempo fit our needs perfectly. A no-frills, no-nonsense vacuum cleaner. It is comparatively quiet, has good suction and the brush action gives the carpet a good going over. We have a small dog that sheds profusely. This vacuum can handle it."
3,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","The good: When it works, it works very, very well. I'd say it compares to those pricier models that are for sale.The bad: It'll last you a couple of years, tops. I've gone through and cleaned out every crevice when it needed it, but after 2 years it's finally breaking down. And oh my lord the smell it makes now. Terrible.The ugly: It's a bagged vacuum, like you'd probably expect. Bags are not cheap. The bags fill up very quickly, sometimes after one full house cleaning, and then you have to insert a new one. I bought my bags at Lowe's and for 3 bags it cost me over $8. You could easily spend over $200 in bags alone per year.Definitely do not buy if you're trying to correct a flea problem...the money in bags alone would kill you."
2,Heavy Heavy Heavy,It is rather cumbersome to vacuum and parts are not great. I would give this a miss. Vacumm suction is good.
3,Good.,"WOrks fine, just very loud and the bags are so tiny, I change them every week! I haven't used a vacuum cleaner for a long time (hard wood floors) so maybe that's okay, but it's a pain for me."
3,HOOVER REGRETS,"GOOD FOR THE MONEY I GUESS... THE 2 BIGGEST PROBLEMS ARE THE BAG IS TO SMALL AND IT LEAVES ABOUT 1 1/2"" AT THE EDGE WHERE IT DOES NOT CLEAN AT ALL. SO YOU END UP WITH A STRIPE ALL AROUND EVERYTHING. WHY DON'T THEY MAKE ALL VACS. WITH EDGE CLEANING... HOW HARD CAN THAT BE !"
3,ok vacuum,"Pros-EconomicalStrong suctionNot to loud (for me anyway)Not very heavyCons-Cord is so short you have to unplug and re plug even in the same room, and I do not have any huge rooms! Just average size rooms.The dust attachment keeps falling offThe worst is the hose!!!! It is very cheap plastic,extremely short, does not bend very well at all. I tried to vacuum my stove with the attachment, and it would not reach without lifting the vacuum!Bottom line for me, if you are looking for a no frills, inexpensive vacuum with none of the extras, but suction is great, go for this vacuum. I think I will be returning it."
2,Tempo widepath,"Like the other reviewers say, this version is not the same as the old one which had such good reviews. It lacks the headlight, doesn't feel very solid, and the attachments on the back won't stay clipped into place. As far as the price goes you are probably getting about what you paid for, maybe a bit over priced though. Wouldn't buy again. Suction seems adequate but wasn't impressed versus our $50 bissell vacuum that it replaced."
4,great price for good product,"After reading consumer reports where Hoover Tempo has been consistantly rated in top five, but never ""recommended"", I bought one in March of 2011.This vacuum has good suction, including thru' tools, appears sturdily built and handles our yellow Lab's hair(and there is a lot!) well. For the price this is a good buy. A couple of minor points: it doesn't have an On/Off switch for brush roll so it runs all the time even when using tools or doing tile floors. Also the tool hose is a little short. But for the price it's hard to beat."
3,Good Hoover,"This machine does everything as advertised. Nothing spectacular, but it does a good job of cleaning my carpets. The attachment hose should be a bit longer, but at this price I really have no reason to complain."
2,Doesn't Pick Up Dirt That Well,I purchased this vacuum cleaner to replace a Hoover Sprint Vacuum I used for 6 years. The Tempo Widepath does a poor job of picking up any dirt particles. I actually did a test between the Hoover Sprint and the Hoover Tempo Widepath. The Sprint picks up everything but the Tempo Widepath leaves the dirt on the carpet. They don't make things like they used to.
4,Hover vac,The vac is as good as the previous reviews I had read. It does an ok job on my hardwood floors and and excellent job on the carpet area.
4,Cleans great but...,This vacuum does a great job on carpet. My only complaints are the short cord and the short hose. Five more feet of cord and a foot of hose would have gotten this vacuum a 5.
5,Great price and performance,"I've had this vacuum for 10 mos. now and am still very pleased. I have two Golden Retrievers who shed a lot and I needed a powerful vacuum.I compared products, including vacuums especially for pets. I read the reviews on here and decided to give it a try. The roller and the hose have strong suction and gets their fur up off the carpet and rugs. It also works better for the car than my shopvac. My mother-in-law just asked me last night if I'd still recommend it, and I would. She's planning to buy one too! Great machine and the low price makes it a bargain."
4,Works well thus far,"We were wanting a vacuum that didn't break the bank but worked efficiently, and this vacuum fits the bill. We have had it for over a month and have used it several times. Time will tell how long it will last, but as of now it has great suction and has been able to handle the hair from two cats. The attachments are the basic attachments usually found and they work well. The vacuum is light weight and works well."
2,Wear earplugs,A mediocre but not terrible vac. Noisy as all get out. Spend a little more and get a Miele S148 or 162 on ebay.
5,Excellent buy!,This is an excellent vac. for the money with lots and lots of power! The only real complaint is it's a little bit loud....Most of them are so I'm not to upset. I would recommend this cleaner. The delivery of it was very fast as well. Thanks Amazon!
1,Cheap Junk,If you want a truly bottom of the barrel (albeit inexpensive) unit buy this- if you want something more than a toy vacuum- get something else.
4,Pretty Good,"My Oreck broke and would cost over $100.00 to repair. We were having financial difficulty and it was right before Christmas. So I researched vacuum cleaners on consumer reports. This vacuum cleaner ranks as high or better than some of the top dollar cleaners. So I bought it for sixty bucks and have been very happy with my purchase. It was easy for my husband to assemble. The tools are easy to use. It gets the pet hair up. It does an excellent job on my carpets. It did only a fair job on my bare floors trying to clean up after the Christmas tree. And it is a little loud and heavy, but, then again, I was using an eight pound Oreck. Overall this is a great economical product that I highly recommend."
4,great for carpet,"Vacuum is very lightweight. does a great job on carpet. Not so great on hard floors. It is difficult to remove the hose for use with the tools, and the hose is too short. Great weight for hauling around the house."
5,"At last, a vacuum that vacuums!","This vacuum has great suction. Yes, it's heavy but it has wheels so don't pick it up and you won't even notice the weight. Super long cord, excellent price."
1,not good for dog hair,"I hate my hoover, would love to replace it today if I could afford it. Does a terrible job on low pile carpet and on bare floors just blows the dog hair around. I had bagless and want it back!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Fantastic suction for animal hair,"I've had this vacuum for 2 weeks now and it works great! I have 3 dogs and 2 cats and it picks up the hair every time. Also works great on hardwood floors. I did a lot of comparison shopping because I was willing to pay more if there was a better pet hair vacuum. But, if you're looking for an affordable vacuum that has wonderful suction, this vac is it! Highly recommended."
1,Short lived,Bought this in January 2011. Stopped working in October 2011. 9 Months. To costly to fix. Cheaper to replace it. Planed obselesence???. Had good suction but it died. What happened to Hoover??
3,A good vacuum with some features I'd prefer different,It cleans well (carpeting and flooring); my wife just wishes the power cord and main hose were longer. They're much shorter than the Sears Kenmore vacuum we previously owned. Otherwise it functions very well (owned about 1 month).
4,Fabulous vacuum,It basically sucks itself over the floor. Only rarely do I need to go over the same area of carpet and I have both a cat and a dog; lots of pet hair. The only problem I have is that the tools to do furniture are fairly short and don't seem to do a great job; I'll probably buy extensions for them.
4,good value,"i hesitated in buying a cheaper vacuum b/c you tend to get what you pay for. but i trusted the other reviews...and it worked out. this is a good vacuum. it has great suction. in fact, be careful b/c it actually tore a hole in a blanket that i accidentally got too close to.i gave it a 4 instead of a 5 b/c it is a bit bulky and the hoses/cords in back are bit awkward - but not a big deal. for the price, you can't beat this vacuum."
4,Great Vacuum For The Price..,"Awesome power!!!..Easy to set up and use. Works great on the carpet, bare floor and the couch. I have 2 dogs and needed something that would take care of the hair....It did that and more. I would give it 5 stars, but?..It's funky blue and a little on the heavy side. But who cares. It gets the job done!..I'm VERY HAPPY!"
4,It Sucks!,"I am very pleased with this vacuum. It just about pulls you across the floor when you start it up-I was kind of surprised as I am used to lighter (smaller) ones with less power and no self propelling at all. I also like the headlight feature. Its clean, not real bulky and even though its a bit heavier-not a problem at all. I definitely am going to send for the longer hose though. My stairs need it. I have pets and am very pleased with the suction and the power of the engine. After all my research, I think I did real well. Also Amazon got it here in a jiffy as always."
4,This thing really sucks,This vacuum has great suction and cleaning power. It does a great job on carpet and tile. The only downside I have found is the hose and attachments.1. The hose is not as flexible or elastic as other vacs I have used.2. There is no swivel joint at the point where the attachments hook on to the hose. This means alot of fighting to get the hose/attachment in the right place.
4,"Great vacuum, but one little problem...","First off - I would like to say that, unlike some of the other customers, I received my vacuum within 7 days - so that was great. As for the vacuum... being a lightweight model, I find it is very easy to push around - almost enjoyable. The suction is so good that, although it does an excellent job on my carpets, I cannot vacuum my 9'x12' oriental rug as it sucks the rug up so tight that I can't even push it. Besides that, I would recommend it for anyone."
4,SOlid,"Works great. Seems cheap with all the plastic, but nothing has broken yet. Used it about 3 times. Like it, good for the money."
3,Needs parts,When it arrived it needed bags and then the belt broke so I would advise anyone to order extra belts when they order it and get extra bags. Good luck it does pick up well.
1,crapped out after 3 weeks,"I was really excited to get this vacuum because I heard all the good reviews. When I received it, it worked great! I really liked it. After about 6 or 7 uses, the brush on the bottom of the vacuum just stopped working. I noticed this when it wouldn't pick up anything. I don't know which suppliers amazon gets this from, but I suspect the belt broke and it may have been a refurbished piece. Got an exchange on the way, hopefully I won't be writing another 1 star review."
1,Motor Broke within 4 months,I bought this vacuum in March for relatively light home use. In July the brush motor stopped working and I have to spend the original price to get it replaced. Cheap but maybe for a reason.
4,Quality Vacuum at an Economical Price,"We purchased this vacuum to replace a Dirt Devil which was similar in design. I am very pleased with the price and quality (so far) of this vacuum. It tends to be a little noisy but most vacuums are. It is much quieter than the vacuum it replaced. Two additional features would take my review from a 4 to 5: 1). Longer cord, 2). Place near handle to clip the cord closest to the vacuum and keep it off the floor and from tangling with the vacuum."
4,Great value!,"I am a big fan of Hoover vacuums and although this isn't the top of the line model, it is a very good vacuum for the price. You can't beat the value! I liked mine so much, that when we moved into our two-story home, I bought this second one. For a minimum investment I don't have to carry the vacuum up and down the stairs!"
4,"Perfect vaccum,for the right price...","I owned this vaccum and very satisfied with it.It has a loud noise and doesn't work on floors but it works perfectly on carpets.Very handy,it has a lot of accesories,easy to operate and changing bags is very convenient.My friend saw this vaccum and bought a new one for her."
4,Great and cheap,"I must say, I am impressed with the amount of power this vacuum has. One would think that for $60 you wouldn't get a whole lot of product, but in this case you get a lot of bang (or should I say, suck) for your buck! Very fast delivery as well, even with the free shipping offer from Amazon."
4,Excellent budget vaccuum,"This vaccuum is rated high by Consumer Reports - and rightly so. For the price, there is not a better powered vacuum on the market - even vaccuums $20-$50 more do not do as good a job vaccuuming. The unit does not lose suction when using the attachments - it's amazing on getting rid of dog hair! Drawbacks are few, but include - doesn't do edges well (you have to use the attachment to get close to the baseboards), on/off switch is low, and it is loud. Pluses well out-weigh the minuses!"
4,Excellent Product-Ohio,"My husband and I always consult Consumers Report before any reviewable product purchase. As usual, they were right on with their recommendation of the Hoover U5140-900 Tempo. You could pay more and get a lot of ""glitz"" but for the purpose intended the vacuum is an excellent choice. As reviewed, it is somewhat loud but not so much as to pay another couple of hundred $ for a little quieter experience."
2,Hoover Widepath vacuum - disappointing,"I purchased this vacuum via Amazon because it was recommended by a well-known consumer rating magazine, and was affordable. It does have good suction and is very lightweight. However, the belt breaks very easily because there is no way to turn off the suction quickly if something large is accidently sucked into the machine. I have had the vacuum for four months, and have had to replace two belts. It also seems almost as if I was sent a used vacuum instead of a new one because the accessory hose was bent, and the first belt and some of the accessories looked worn."
3,Just okay/hose too short,"This vacuum seems to be very powerful with great suction, and I really appreciate that it filters and cleans the air while I'm vacuuming. As far as I can tell it is cleaning my carpet just fine. For the first few times I used the vacuum it left very tiny black pieces of plastic all over my wood laminate floor. Also when you push the vacuum to move it from room to room the bottom drags on the carpet. I'm 5'5"" and in order for it not to drag I'd probably have to be another three or more inches taller. The worst thing about this vacuum is that the flexible hose is not long enough! The hose is so short that the vacuum has to be right next to me in order to use the attachments. A longer hose is available to purchase from Hoover for around $34 or more plus shipping, but that cost negates the great value that I thought I was getting with this vacuum."
1,"Waste of money, doesnt clean at all","I bought this a month back and I am very disappointed.I have a carpeted floor, I tried this vaccum and instead of sucking the dust, it just keeps spreading it all over the place.(Even if I keep it on the maximum ). For cleaning a small area it takes 15-20 mts of several rounds . At the end its EXTREMELY furstrating to see - dust still remains!It is not worth it! Please dont waste your money. Its tempting becuase of the low price, but you are not going to trash the dust, but your money if you buy this!"
1,A complete lemon,"This vacuum cleaner was a lemon. Totally non-functional. Blew exhaust all over, rousing clouds of dust, no suction to pick it up."
4,My own vacuum!,"My own vacuum ? Just separated from my husband and settled nicely in a two bed apartment. Didn't leave with much, and a vacuum cleaner was on my list of things to buy, though not necessarily at the top. When married my husband decided he was the expert on anything that plus in, came home with a $500 Miele canister one day. Didn't pick up great, was cumbersome and hard to store away. This time I got to select, and did search all the different reviews out there from other Amazon customers. Decided on the Hoover, not as light as I thought it would be, but as I am on one floor that is okay. Picks up great both on carpet and hard floors. I have a dog a 2 cats, so getting up the animal fur was a must. Hoover has always benn a reliable name, remember when I was a kid (and I am 58 now) we had a Hoover. Most people did, no one said vacuuming they all said Hoovering whether they had a \Hoover or not. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone, who wants a great product at a low cost."
3,OK for a little vacuum,"I bought this vacuum cleaner about 4 years ago. It's been a good little vacuum. When we first got it, it had awesome suction. It has decreased a bit since, but it's still all right. I like that it is small and light enough for the kids to use. Here are a few things to be aware of:1)The suction hose contracts significantly when used--it can't handle the suction and it shrinks--which makes it extremely hard to use as you have hardly any reach. It's impossible to do stairs with it since the hose will only reach about one step up.2)The bag is very small and it fills really fast so you go through a lot of bags.3)After three years of use, the on/off switch started having problems--you have to play with it to get it to stay on."
1,I cannot recommend it.,"As others have pointed out, it does not work well on tile or hard surfaces. And when on carpet it is extremely noisy and I've had it drop dirt out of the machine as I pull it back off carpet to the tiles."
1,broken belts,"I HATE this vacuum cleaner. Bought it based on your reviews and consumer reports. I have had to replace the belt 4 times in less than a year.........it takes nothing at all for it to go. I got it for carpets, and it's fine when it works, but it never works! Also, it's awkward and heavy........the only thing that seems to work is the light on the front, in case I feel like vacuuming in the dark!"
5,Used for almost two years - Works great,"I bought this one for about two years before. Man, this is really reliable, for the past two years worked very fine, no issues. It is little noisy, but I can live with it.Value for money - fast amazon shipping."
2,Belt Comes Off Regularly,"This has great suction, it's a great price, but we constantly have to open up the bottom and put the belt back on. It doesn't break, it falls off. And it's a very tight fitting belt so I don't understand why. Also, it's quite loud. Otherwise it's OK."
3,Worked great for a couple of years,"Purchased this vacuum a couple of years ago because of the positive consumer ratings and favorable ranking in Consumer Reports digest. Was super pleased with its suction and especially the price! I had no intention of spending a fortune on a vacuum. I MUCH prefer bagged models so this was a replacement for the bagless vacuum that I had been using. I recently noticed that my vacuum started emitting a ""hot"" smell during operation and was not picking up obvious pieces of dirt on my area rugs and carpet. I guess I can't be too upset because it was an inexpensive vacuum and you can't expect a $70 vacuum to last forever! I will be trying the $44 Dirt Devil next!"
4,It's great!,"It's a little loud and the material is a little cheap but it has great suction. I have both hard wood floor and carpet and no pets. I don't need anything fancy and for the price I paid, it's such a good deal compared to $99 at Sears. And it does a wonderful job!"
2,"ok, but for special occasions","Not especially sturdy, tiny and expensive replacement bags, but if you don't mind the noise it gets the job done.."
4,Does The Job,"Noisey,Hose a bit too short, extentions and tools must be pushed on firmly or they come apart. So why 4 stars? IT CLEANS..... For around $60.00 you can not go wrong. I have disposed of vacuums after three years that cost 5 times the price. Go for it!!!!!!"
1,completely worthless on hardwoods,"do not buy if you plan on using for hardwood floors. i'm sure it works just fine on carpet, but only spits stuff around otherwise. amazon was quick with shipment and great for the return; GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE>"
1,Junk,"I bought the vacuum and the first time I used it is was great. The second time, something happened as it is so loud, you can't hear anything. It vacuums ok but there must be a bearing out. Now, how do I get it warranted. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good product for the money.,For the money I paid I am quite satisfied with the Hoover U5140-900Tempo Widepath vacuum.
3,Only good for carpet.,"We've had two of these units for just over a year now and they both still work really well (on carpet). The reason I only gave it three stars was because it doesn't work at all on bare floors. The reason for this is that even though you can adjust the height slightly, you can't turn off the rollers which means they ""kick"" everything out behind it. The best way to experience this is by trying to vacuum up Cheerios in your bare feet. The flying Cheerios pelt your feet and ocassionally break into smaller pieces so you have even more mess to clean up. To supplement the poor job this unit does on bare floors we purchased an inexpensive ""Dirt Devil"" stick type vacuum and it works great. Overall I would give it 5 stars for carpet and 1 star for bare floors for an average of 3 stars."
4,Seems like a great little vacuum so far!,"After a month of use, this seems to be a fantastic machine. Very basic but has really good suction and does the edges well even without the tools but those also work well. It's nice and light so moves easy. It's the right handle length and although the cord is a bit short this is easily fixed by using an extension cord. It's not a quiet vacuum nor a overly loud one just has an average noise level. In conclusion, I like it, and at this price you cant beat it!"
4,Hoover U5140,"Very light weight, does a great job of picking up dog hair and generally cleans thoroughly. Time will tell this products' reliability."
3,"Good suction, cheaply made","Has really good suction, however the parts attached come off easily and are hard to get on initially. It's also not the best looking vacuum, but worth the price!"
2,worked well for a month,I don't know what happened but it worked well for about a month. Maybe the belt came off because it became hard to push and pull. It does make a lot of noise and blows a lot of air out of it. The hose to operate the attachment tools is too short so the vacuum falls over when trying to get hard to reach places. I gave it away.
4,Good Product,"This is a good and powerful vaccuum cleaner and cleans the carpet very well. However, cleaning of floor is supported but doesn't clean very well. Overall, I am satisfied with the product for the price I paid on Amazon."
2,Not What I Expected,"We got a good price on the vacuum, but the belt keeps breaking. The original belt broke after one use. We purchased a new belt and it broke too. Not sure what is going on. I'm going to call around to see if there is a defect."
4,WOW!!!!!! What a vacuum!,"This machine has a lot of pep! its almost self propelled. Has a great sucking power. I dont like too much the attatchments, kind of cheap. but what more can you ask for the price? Iam VERY happy with my purchase. And happier with Amazon who gave me free shipping and I got it in 2-3 days!! I was amazed! thanks Amazon!"
4,good vacuum for the price,"got this because Consume Reports said it was good and it was cheap ($54 total!)It preforms as expected. it has strong suction and works as a vacuume should. having used it only 3 times, i have not had belt break issues like some others have said. it also has a hose attachment which is nice. the lid t it is cheap and falls off, but so what, this was an extra feature i did not require. at any rate if you need a good, cheap vacuume this one preforms fine. get it and save the $$$"
3,Only fair.,Vacuum picks up well but has two shortcomings. It's extremely noisy and the bags clog repeatedly.Don Martin
4,"big bang for the buck, a couple complaints","I bought this product after reading consumer reports reviews, and customer reviews from consumer reports and amazon. For the money we paid for the product, it has been fantastic. As far as vacuum cleaners go, it's not too noisy. It's definitely easy to handle, has strong suction, easy ""carry handle"", and is relatively light weight. Cons: the hose is incredibly short so when i wanted to get to some cobwebs on my not too high ceiling as i was standing on a stool and lifting the vacuum, i still couldn't do it. i believe there is a hose attachment which is probably worth buying. other con: according to the amazon site and packaging, this model is supposed to come with the ""carpet light"", ""dirt finder indicator"", and ""full bag indicator"", none of which can be found on my model. Not huge losses for me, but i'd have appreciated receiving the product i thought i was buying. All in all, I'd recommend the product to a friend, and I'd buy it again."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumIt seems as thought I've owned a million vacuum cleaners & this is by far one of the best. It's better than the Bissell bagless vacuums I've owned by far!!! It shipped out right away; I received it in less than 5 days & maybe I shouldn't be but I was impressed. I'm also impressed w/the way it sucks up everything which is a nice change from vacuuming the same spot about 10 times before the damn thing will pick up a fuzzy on the floor! LOL
2,Motor caught fire after a year and a half,"I was reasonably happy with this vacuum cleaner for a year and a half. It's not the best I ever had but it was getting the job done. However I am very disappointed that the motor literally caught fire after a year and a half. This could have been a very hazardous situation. Plus, the motor isn't a user serviceable part and the warranty lasts only 1 year, so getting it replaced will cost more than buying a new vacuum cleaner. But this time I won't be buying another Hoover."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,Sorry I wasted my money on this one last year! It no longer picks up anything and my husband had to take it apart before using last time...on its way to the landfill now and off to buy a different one.
5,Good Sweeper,"Very pleased with the Hoover Tempo Widepath, it is just a basic sweeper that does the job at a reasonable price. I have gone through about 5 vacuums in the last five years. I always research them before I buy and I have paid up to $200.00 for them, but they never last. At least if this one doesn't last I did not break the bank and so far it has performed better than its predecessors."
2,Power cord is crap,This vacuum has good suction but the power cord is a cheap plastic and continually gets tangled. You'll spend as much time untangling the cord as you will actually vacuuming.
2,Just Okay!,"It cleans pretty well. However there are some major design problems. Number one the cord gets entagled in the hose the way things are setup. Also this baby is Loud with a capital ""L"". Surprised it is so loud for such a lightweight vac. Also the vac is made very poorly. In fact, mine shipped with all kinds of dust on it from the factory--I'm sure somewhere in China.I suppose these are the tradeoffs for a vacuum this price."
4,Item as expected.,"Easy assembly. Easy to use. Have not used the attachments yet, but purchased unit mainly for vacuuming floors. Positive experience so far."
3,The hose needs improvement,"This vacumn has good suction. The problems are that the hose is too short, it comes off while you are using it, it is cumbersome and stiff. You have to work it out of the suction hole to use the hose. So far, I think the vacumn is worth it's money, but Hoover needs to work on the hose. Some simple adjustments would make it a much better machine."
3,Good power but belt keeps slipping,"I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago. It works great on stationary carpet. The motor provides good power to pick up dirt in as little as two passes. With respect to power, I have been very happy with the vacuum. But the powerful motor has been a mixed blessing because I can't use it loose on rugs. And when something gets caught on the brush rotor, it overheats and the belt slips off. The belt has broken on me once and has recently started slipping. Often enough that it's starting to become an annoyance to undo the 4 screws to put the belt back on. Good vacuum for the price though. I'd invest in something better if I had the money."
4,Hoover U5140-900 Upright Vaccum,"Great vaccum. Same attachments and style as the u5146-900. Very powerful, slightly louder than other vaccums. Takes type Y bags. Highly recommended"
2,Great Vacuum...til it caught on fire,"I thought this was a really good vacuum for the first 6 months. It had really good suction, and picked up cat hair excellently. I was so glad to have found such an inexpensive vacuum that did a good job.Then, today, I was using the attachments to clean under my dining room table (hardwood floor) and just as I thought to myself, ""something smells funny"", my 3 year old said, ""Oooo! Fire!"", and sure enough the vacuum was on fire. I tossed it out the front door, and it set the doormat on fire, too.No one was hurt, the house didn't burn down, but it seems fair to say that I won't be buying another of these."
3,Broken Belt Blues,"I like this little vacuum cleaner, which has great suction, is lightweight, and is a good deal for the money. But like quite a few other reviewers, I have been disappointed in the poor design of the belt mechanism. I had a belt break within the the first week of use, and the recommended replacement belt is much too tight, which may explain why it breaks so often. I've decided to buy replacement belts in bulk--and take the advice of another reviewer who suggested buying a slightly larger belt model (38528-008) than the manufacturer suggests. Replacing the belt so often is a hassle, however, which explains my 3-star rating."
3,Not for people with bad backs,"Pros- Good cleaning capabilities.- Good priceCons:- Very short hose, making it virtually impossible to use the attachment devices- When attachment devices are used, the brush continues to roll, sucking dirt into the open end of the hose(lid doesnt close correctly).- Very hard to pull back for people with bad backs(pushing is a breeze..!!)"
3,"Good warranty, but it broke quickly","This is a very good vacumn that works very well, but the motor on ours went out after only a couple of months.The warranty covered the repairs, but it doesn't seem to work as well after the repairs."
1,Skip it,This was a poor purchase. It's pick up ability was weak and the attachments never worked. Very disappointed. Look for other options.
3,"You get what you pay for, a simple vacuum","I own a high end Hoover and now this one. This one is around $60 and my other was around $200. This one feels like $60. It works, don't get me wrong, but the hose and attachments are lower quality, you can feel.One annoying aspect is the hose keeps unsnapping from the base when using the wand. It is a cheaper and stiffer hose compared to its more expensive counterparts, so I just have to be more careful.While it feels cheap, I think it will last. If you can't afford a $200 version or have a smaller home, this should work fine."
4,Very good & powerful suction,"Definitely a great buy, especially for the price. Great power, suction and it's quiet. The only complaint, and it's not bad, is that the attachments fall of easily. Other than that, I love it and highly recommend it!"
4,Just what I needed...,"This Hoover was a replacement for a similar model that I owned for about 10 years. My old one was great, and would have kept going had I not accidently sucked up a small piece of wood which damaged it. This new one has a lot of suction power, and I have to adjust the pile height control a little higher so that it doesn't grab the carpet so much - it actually pulls itself along which makes the vac feel lighter as you're pushing it. A few minor gripes: 1) The vac is very loud, but that was expected at this price level. 2) The door on the front that covers the bag has a flimsy latch - feels like it will open too easiIy. 3) Wish it had a retractable cord. Other than that, it's thoughtfully designed and less messy than a bagless. My family has used Hoovers for over 30 years - they are very dependable and last a long time. I would recommend this vac."
1,"Unreliable, poor quality","I bought this vacuum machine in April 2012 and it stopped working after only five months. It's unreliable, designed badly and of poor quality. The one year parts/labor warranty does not cover the agitator belt. Once it breaks down, you will have to get it fixed on your own. So much for the one year part/labor warranty. it hardly deserves a star"
5,Quality astounding for the price,"This really is the industry standard for vacuum cleaners and should be all a family ever needs. It is astounding how cheap this vaccum cleaner is relative to all of the fancy vacuums out there when it out-performs virtually every other vacuum cleaner I've ever used. It is powerful, light enough to get around the house, and fairly easy to empty. I cannot justify buying $200 fancy vacuums when this retails for so much less and does everything you need."
2,Model has changed--you can't trust older reviews.,"We purchased this vacuum cleaner in late 2008 and liked it so much we purchased another as a present in 2009. We bought a third in January 2012, but this is not the same vacuum as before. The current version is of much lower quality. While unboxing it we noticed several differences from the 2008/9 version:-The new version does not have a light.-The attachments are much flimsier. They are no longer gray (as pictured), but black. The furniture and crevice tool are comparable, but the dusting attachment is much cheaper.-The brush is of much lower quality.-The pieces do not fit together as well and many of the edges are unfinished.-There is no longer a full-bag indicator, but this is a minor thing.The motor, body, hose and extensions appear the same, but it is no longer the value that it was three years ago.When deciding whether to purchase this product, keep in mind that older reviews cannot be trusted. We returned it and recommend that you pass."
3,Not as advertised,"Pros:Great suctionInexpensiveCons:No bag indicatorNo headlightShort cordShort hoseHose doesn't anchor in - if you twist it a little while using it (i.e. all the time), it will disconnectDoes not work well on hard surfacesYes, it's under $100. Yes, it would be good in a small apartment. Yes it's good on carpet and fabrics. No, I would not recommend for a large house, a house with kids and/or pets or if 50% of the house has hard floors.You get what you pay for!"
2,Wish I had my old vacuum back...,"My old Samsung had a pretty short cord, which drove me a bit crazy, but otherwise it was a great, lightweight, easy to use vacuum cleaner. This Hoover Tempo has a long cord, is fairly lightweight and the bag-changing is easy. But... it doesn't work well on all of my rugs. I have a couple thick ones, and it works pretty well on those, but on the area rugs with low pile it sucks the rug up and makes it very hard to push the vacuum across the rug. I get a work out every time I clean my house. The manual adjustment is easy to use but feels cheesy, as if it will break off soon. I have tried every height adjustment on my thinner area rugs, none of them work. Another pet peeve -the cord wrap design defies logic - really awkward and the person who designed it should be hung by his/her thumbs."
2,Not up to Hoover Standard,"I was really excited to get this because it had high ratings. NOT!!! Cord on back of vacuum too low to ground - when you go back and forth you run over it. Cord is too short [could live with that, personally. if all else was okay.] Off/on button not easily excessible with thumb... you need to use your second hand while holding vacuum to shut it... if you need to turn off quickly. Vacuum positions: floor, many carpet heights - no position for ""tools"". Beater does continue to run when using tools... suction is probably okay... but did find dirt from beater was spilling out slightly as I continued to use tools. Found vacuum didn't get ALL dirt off ""floor"" had to use tools to catch it all. Light on vacuum good. I would certainly seek out another vacuum. Thumbs down on this one!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hoover is not what it used to be!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner less than a year ago. I bought it because my last vacuum cleaner was a Hoover, and I loved it. It lasted well over 10 years with no problems. This vacuum cleaner, however is a disappointment. After a while, i noticed that it did not pick up like it used to. I had to pass the same spot several times in order to get up loose dirt. Then last week it died. While vacuuming the living room, I spelled something burning and shut it off. After opening it up, I found the belt torn. So I went to the store and replaced it with a brand new one, thinking that this was the problem. But immediately after turning the vacuum on again, the burning smell returned, and the brand new belt snapped.Compared to my last Hoover vacuum cleaner, I am very disappointed in this one, primarily because of its short lifespan. Then, after reading the Consumer Reports, I found out the Hoover is not good these days on longevity. So I am switching to another brand."
5,This is my second Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright,"Compared to the previous one that lasted 2 years at US$68, the new one is of thinner plastic; does not have a cap attached to the attachment host; but the cable is about a foot longer so that you could cover a larger area without unplugging. Since the plastic is thinner, it is lighter to carry around. I put an old sock in the attachment host and that works well. As a matter of fact, it works even better than the old design with a cap because the cap is loose and I often opened it by accident and dust will come off all over. I use the attachemnt tools to vacuum hard floor and it is fine with me. The suction power is still as strong as before. So all in all, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good basic household vacuum cleaner at a reasonable price."
1,Only lasted 5 months,"I purchased this vacuum Feb 22, 2009. It stopped working last week. A belt must of broke because there is no suction. The hose still works but I was not impressed with that part to begin with. The hose is to short to get much work done with that part. I didn't use the vacuum that often. Now I wish I had,because then maybe it would have broken down WITHIN the warranty and return time.My old bissel lasted for 5 yrs."
1,"Great in the begining, then dead after 1.5 years!","After 1.5 years of light usgage the switch to turn on vacuum started to spark and then nothing worked. Tried taking the entire vacuum apart and could not find the problem. So, if you want this vacuum, just realize that you might have to replace it within 2 years."
4,Hoover Tumpo Vacuum,"Appears to be a good value. Does and excellent job of cleaning. The only pointit is a little loud, but not excessive."
3,I am sick of expensive bagless models modify review after 2 years,"I have 3 expensive bagless models in my garage and they are all going in the yard sale next week. I am sick of clapping out dirty filters and cups. I don't want to spend $600 to do what i can do with this old-fashioned bagged model. Just throw the dirt out. If it were the other way around and bagless were here first, then this would be the windstorm of new products. WOW, you don't have to even see the dirt? Just toss it? No allergy meds to vaccum? And for this price, I could replace it twice a year (with free shipping) and still come out ahead. Don't discontinue this vaccum!After 2 years we have lost suction for no known reason, the attachment tube is crushed, and it is really useless. It is hard to push and a hassle to use...doesn't really function anymore.OK for the short term if you get a good price, but don't expect it to last."
1,disappointed,I purchased this vacuum to use on my wood floors. The review claims it is excellent on hard surfaces. This machine is terrible on wood surfaces. It shoots the dirt out the back of the machine which actuallys stings your legs as you walk behind the machine. Not worth the hassle to return so I will just deal with it for now.
4,"Great vacuum, cord is a little short","I was a little concerned about how good this vacuum cleaner would be since the price was so low, but after reading many of the other positive reviews, I decided to try it. I had another Hoover vacuum that I paid much more for (it only runs for 10 mins before quitting) and which was bagless, but decided to try going back old fashion bag types. I reviewed many of the Dyson's since people rave about them, but didn't want to spend several hundred for a vacuum cleaner that looks like a toy space rocket. This bagged vacuum cleaner appears to vacuum much better than my old Hoover to the point where I can actually feel a little difference in the cleanliness of the carpet when walking barefoot. While I do have to replace bags now, they are pretty cheap and I don't have to worry about dust flying every where (compared to bagless) when I go dump it outside in the trash.The only gripe I have with this unit is the cord is short."
2,Belt Broke on 1st Use,"The cleaner worked well for a few rooms, then the belt broke. This happened couple hours after I received it, so I wasn't inclined to gamble on future reliability. Someone I know has same model, however he purchased his a couple years ago, and there are differences: bag indicator light, etc.. This leads me to believe that Hoover is cutting corners to make more money off of a popular model. It'd still be a good deal for the price, assuming that it worked consistently for a year at least. I hate shopping for stuff, but will send this one back, I don't feel like taking a chance of adding another cleaner to the junkyard soon."
5,Great vacuum...and cheap!!!,"Super vacuum and unbelievable value! Arrived in record time, also! Plan to get another for the other level!"
4,Very Good Basic Carpet Cleaning,"Very good basic carpet cleaning; not great on stairs. Using attachments is limited in reach by the coil cord and length of extensions.The power cord is shorter and the Hoover is heavier than Oreck XL.The Oreck XL was more expensive to buy, but more importantly requires almost annual maintenance attention.Tempo is well priced if it lasts 10years like the low maintenance Hoover it replaced."
5,Super sucker!!!,This little vacuum packs a powerful punch--it was easy to set up and almost propelled itself! Am telling everyone I know and am buying another for a friend!
5,awesome,I bought this for my Mom who was tired of cleaning her bag less cleaner. Junk was always getting stuck in the filter. I purchased this Hoover for her because of the many positive reviews on Amazon and the bag feature. I used the vacuum and found it has great suction and is a great vacuum. I will be ordering one for myself.
5,great vac for the price,"I bought this to replace a horrid little dirt devil upright. Because it was for our vacation property I didnt want to spend as much a I did for the vaccum that I bought for the main house which is also a hoover and also very good. [...]I looked on consumer reports before buying and chose this one because of how high it ranked. I was a little nervous at first because of how light it felt, but it really seemed to bring my carpet back to life after the first use. I have only had it for a few weeks so I am not sure of the belt issue, but I figure I can afford to fix a belt every now and then for the price I paid for this vacuum. Oh, I almost forgot.. I have two dogs and a cat; it tackles the pet hair and stray litter with no problem at all. Not to mention that this is the desert dust.Great buy, I highly recommend it!"
5,satisfied in Washinton,I purchased this vacume because of its price and ratings on consumer reports. I have not been dissappointed!
1,Disappointed,This vacuum worked well for several months and then went straight downhill. I bought it based on Consumer Reports reviews and other reviews I read here.The problems I experienced were: hair got caught in the roller brush and I had to take the thing apart to fix it EVERY TIME I used it. It spits out dirt all over the place now and won't vacuum up anything.I'm now looking at Dyson vacuums as I'm sick of cheap quality. This is the third vacuum cleaner I've had in the past couple of years.
5,The Big Secret,"i love love love my animals but so overwhelmed with the hair ... with both a cat and a dog, i was saving for one of those $400-$600 sweepers made especially for animal hair...timely, my consumer reports mag reviewed vacs and this model was rated 3rd in performance and 1st in lowest price!!! without hesitating, i ordered and couldn't wait to try it...my new Hoover arrived in just a few days, and i put it to the test. UNBELIEVABLE! it's been years since i used ""bags"" and having read about the advantages of bag vs. bagless i am thrilled in every way with this purchase. now i can love my animals without taking their hair with me everywhere i go! i highly recommend this product both for performance and affordability!!!!!"
3,Good apartment vacuum - brush belt broke after 30 mins,"The vacuum itself is made entirely of plastic but is powerful and seems relatively sturdy. After only 30 minutes of use the belt that drives the brush snapped. Luckily, the belt was only a couple bucks and replacement was easy but inconvenient nonetheless."
2,Not good as advertised,"Did not clean very well, so sent it back for a refund. Only recommend it if you don't want to spend much for a vacuum."
4,Great machine for the money,"I bought the Hoover based on its being recommended by Consumer Reports. True to what they said, it cleans very well, is easy to use and is lightweight. The tools are relatively easy to use and are close at hand. All in all, a fantastic bargain. My only complaint is a slightly cheap feel to some of the plastics (I guess you've got to cut costs somewhere at this price point) and the undeniable fact that this thing is LOUD. I'd give it five stars otherwise."
3,Nice vacuum,"I switched to this vacuum after using bagless vacuum for 5 years.Pros: Very good suction power, Good upholstery kitCons: No bag indicator, Not good for bare floorsIt's a basic model and I am satisfied with this powerful vacuum cleaner."
4,pleased with my purchase!,"I bought this product based on online research and other reviews to replace a bagless vacuum that I absolutely HATED. The Hoover is a HUGE improvement with great suction, a wide head and extra-long extension cord. My only complaints are that it's a little hard to get into tight spaces, and the whole machine bears a little to the left in use, but that could be my own fault in putting together the assembly. Overall, well worth the reasonable price."
4,nice sweeper for the money,I think the sweeper is great for the money. The only thing I would recommend is to purchase an extension hose attachment because the hose supplied is just not long enough to perform basic cleaning functions. I have to constantly move the sweeper around to use the accesories. The hose is just not long enough and it is a constant struggle to manuver the sweeper as you try to clean.
5,love this,I had a hoover widepath before and liked that one. So when I was looking for a new vacuum I checked reviews for good vacuums and this one came up I had to buy it. I love this vacuum it is definitly self propelled you don't really need to push it. It just goes! It does a very good job picking up.
3,"Works as advertised, had it only for 3 months-sold it to friend","Worked as advertised but I had to sell it off when I moved. Nothing spectacular. Noisy, but does the job. Too expensive IMO. Should be around 50 dollars."
4,GREAT BUY!!!,"This is a really good vacuum!!! The suction is fabulous!! I would have given it 5 stars if the hose was longer. Other than that it works just as good as any of the other more expensive vacuums I've owned, and lets face it whether you pay $500.00 or $89.00 they are all made out of the same lousy plastic, so why not buy this one at this ridiculously low price of less than $60.00! My goodness, if it lasts only a year so what?, just buy another one!!!"
1,"Poor Quality, Improperly assembled at factory !!!!","I paid extra to receive it in 2 days, but I could not use it because the hose fitting was assembled at the factory wrong. They installed it backwards, and I can not use the machine. I used the help website to send an e-mail and found no acccess to e-mail. Called the help phone number and hung up after being on hold for 20 minutes. Called the nearest service center and he said return it to where you bought it, eventhough the Hoover documentation says go the service center first. The service center also mentioned it would take a while to get the replacement hose because they are very slow. Poor quality and customer service."
4,"Very Good on Carpet, not on bare floor",Its a very good vacuum for the price and does a very good job on the carpet. Has very good suction and easy to maneuver around. On the bare floor it does a ok job. Overall I would recommend this.
3,Great suction but not happy with other features,"I bought this back in June 2008. It has great suction and even though it says it's not self propelled, it moves very easily.However, the front cover doesn't snap into place on mine. Also, the ""new bag indicator"" doesn't work. I also don't like how you have to unscrew four screws to clean the roller head. I have long hair so I have to clean it off every onther time I use it. It's a hassle to uncrew the bottom EVERY time."
5,I love this vacuum!,"I bought this to replace my old Hoover vacuum, and I love it!! It has great suction and a lot of power. Definitely worth the price I paid for it!!"
4,What more could you want.,"This machine is light, has strong suction power and is wonderfully simple to operate. The best thing however is the price. The Hoover Tempo has fewer bells and whistles but who needs all that added weight and expense."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath,"Pretty good vacuum cleaner for the money. It works great and it's light weight. It has the look and feel of a toy vacuum cleaner but it gets the job done. Two things that I do not like. The attachment hose is connected a bit too high up and when you pull on the hose the vacuum tips over. Also, the electrical cord is about 2 feet shorter than my previous vacuum cleaner (also a Hoover), so it's reach is not as long. I liked being able to plug it into one outlet and vacuum an entire area without having to switch outlets. This is just a minor thing to me. Good vacuum cleaner for under $100!"
4,Good value,"Not the best vacuum I've ever owned but a great value for the price. Fairly light weight and easy to use. Cord wraps a little awkwardly on the back - looks like a design after-thought. Converting to hose use is not ideal. You basically pull the main hose out of a receptacle and add the attachments. No separate hose. Not as solid feeling as other vacuums I've owned. Minor quibbles aside, you probably have to spend 75-100% more to get something better. If you assume you will be replacing your vacuum every 5 years or so this is a safe bet. Or if you want a vacuum for each floor, buy a few of these and don't deal with dragging one up and down the stairs all of the time."
2,Disappointed,"I just assembled this vacuum and must say I'm pretty disappointed. It is outrageously loud. Second, as others have mentioned, its motions are jerky. It's difficult to turn while vacuuming because of the auto-propelling feature. Third, it is brutal on my thinner carpets. I have several oriental carpets on the smaller side (4x6) and it practically vacuumed them up. I have another shaggy rug, large, that it dug into and raised off the floor. The hose is thick and awkward to use, and honestly, with the noise I can't imagine putting my head anywhere near the motor while using the attachments. Too bad. Sending it back."
5,"Good, Decent vacuum Cleaner","This is a good, decent meat-and-potatoes vacuum cleaner minus lot of frills but does what it's supposed to: clean carpets.The motor is powerful, 12 amps, with about the same power as its more expensive brethren. The attachments, all unpowered, are the ""standard"" ones -- crevice tool, brush tool, furniture tool. Happily the tools from our old $300 vacuum seem to fit this one, too. It does an excellent job of getting the dirt out of the carpet, folds flat to the floor for reaching under coffee tables and end tables, and because it's relatively lightweight is easy to manuever. The height adjustment, though not automatic, gives a good range of heights and though we don't use it for bare floors, I expect it will do well there, also.So, if you want a powerful, low-priced vacuum that does a great job cleaning your carpets, you can spend more for gadgets, but why would you? At this price, I can buy two more and still not spend what I spent on the one it's replacing."
2,Stopped sucking,"I have had this since June 2011, I may vacuum twice a month, very small house, light work, now it does not suck anymore, has a new belt and bag. So it does not last long.Disappointed, don't buy."
2,Hoover Tempo Upright Vacuum,"After using this product for a couple of days, I will return. While it did seem to have lots of power as described, when trying to use the hose attachment it was blowing debris from the detached area into the room?! Also, the hose itself is also too short and after attempting to reach an area at full extension, the vacuum would fall on me. Not very safe and very disappointed. I will return to my Eureka Smart Vac!"
3,It's just OK,"This vacuum serves the purpose. It actually pulls me across the floor while vacuuming, but I've adjusted to that. Like other have said the hose serves no purpose because its way to short to reach anything. Overall a good buy though."
4,Great purchase,"Have a small apartment with hardwood floors. Was looking for a vacuum that I could rely on, and found this one with such great stats. The machine will definitely pull you along. It has great suction power. Wish there was more flexibility with the tube. Otherwise an excellent purchase for the price."
3,Vacuum,"This vacuum does a good job with the 'sucking' ability. I selected it because of the Consumer Reports rating being so high and it was the lowest priced one on the rating. However, it does not maneuver well, it is EXTREMELY LOUD and I cannot turn off the beaters when I go over my tile and laminate floors.. Anywho, if you do not go from carpet to tile, it would be better.."
4,Great Vacuum for the Money,"For the money this is a very good vacuum. The bags fill up fast so buy extra, also buy extra belts they will come in handy. I would buy this vacuum again."
4,Great value Hoover,"This vacuum works better than the Hoover that I spent three times as much to buy! Works great on wood floors and on my carpets. You have to assemble it and the screws used to hold the handle on fell to the bottom of the box and were very hard to find. Once they were in, handle is great. When I first used the hose on my stairs, I was a little confused b/c there is no lid over what looks to be the intake. It didn't matter though, everything went inside the bag as it was supposed to. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,"No frills, but works great!","This is a no-frills vacuum cleaner, but its cheap and works very well. Just be sure to keep the bag cleaned out and make sure the hose doesn't get cloged. Also, if the belt breaks, it is pretty easy to fix."
5,Sometimes Cheap Is Better,"I was in the market for new vacuum...it's impossible to get good reviews from users, since most everyone hates to vacuum. I went with this cheap model that had relatively good reviews from Amazon users. Works great...and at the price it becomes a throw away product if it breaks."
4,it's working!,I had to buy a vacuum quickly as our vintage 70s Hoover upright had broken down. While I was getting it fixed (worth every penny) I took a chance on this. It is disconcertingly... plastic... but it has been doing a good job. It can't last the 30 years (and counting) that our old one has-- and I'm sure it isn't supposed to-- but I do recommend it within its genre.
4,"Not used to the cheap stuff, but.....","I purchased this Hoover because the online reviews indicated it was good and it was cheap. It will be used solely in my classroom because the one our custodian uses on our brand new carpet spits up more dust than it collects. At home I have a Rainbow and a Sears upright, both excellent machines. You get what you pay for as far as materials go with this Hoover, but this machine does well what it was purported to do. My classroom has never been so clean!:)"
4,Great for the price,"This vacuum does an excellent job on carpeting. Compared to my last vacuum, it is easy to push and doesn't give me a hernia when I lift it. Although the tools are conveniently located on the vacuum itself, the hose is too short to do anything without the tube extensions."
4,Hoover U5140-900 performs well,"The vacuum does everything it's supposed to do. Positives: Good suction, not too heavy, attached hose is easy to use, inexpensive. Negatives: The attached hose is short; the cord is 20' which is shorter than I prefer."
4,powerful,"This replaced another Hoover that was about 10 years old. That one started to smell badly when used. This is a major improvement on that one, and not just because the old was broken. This one is much more powerful and has a light and the attachments work better - all for about the same price paid 10 years ago. I recommend it."
5,Perfect/Flawless,This is a great vacuum. Works like a charge and sucks up cat hair and pet hair with no problem. This is a 10 out of 10.
4,Works great for a great deal,"I was looking for a cheap, light model that I could easily drag up and down 3 flights of stairs. I've only used this one once, but it worked great. The extension hose isn't too long, but I didn't have any trouble carting it up the stairs as I vacuumed. Bags seem like the cleanest, easiest way to go (and were recommended by a vacuum repair store locally), so that was a plus. On a side note, I did burn up the belt on the first go round, but I left a wash cloth in the way for it to suck up while I used the hose, which was my fault. Did a cheap change of the belt and it seems fine now."
4,Good value for money,"Previously owned a Dirt Devil Featherlite. The Hoover not only outcleaned it, but cost less than I paid originally for the Dirt Devil!"
4,Great at this price,Very strong. Perfect for an apartment or garden home. Nice attachments.Pleased wioth the quality.
4,"Good product, terrible customer service!","Good product, but hope that you don't have to call customer service. There were rude, didn't want to help and would only help when the issue was given to a manager.Hope you don't have to use their customer server!!"
3,You get what you pay for,"The vacuum quality is fair. It is odd that, in order to use the attachments, you have to disconnect the hose on the back of the machine. Past models have been more convenient."
1,Poor vacuum power,This vacuum is so over-rated. It is noisy with very poor vacuum power that it even can't pick up a small piece of leave.
1,this vacuum does not clean carpets,"This vacuum does not clean standard-pile rugs because the brush doesn't go low enough to reach the top of the rug. This means that lint snagged on top of the rug is not lifted and is not vacuumed up. It also means that the rug is not vibrated so dust and dirt particles lying below the surface of the pile are not freed and are not vacuumed up, either.Whoever designed this piece of junk is either a moron or an undercover saboteur from a rival vacuum cleaner company.Don't buy this thing. It may be great for bare floors and shag rugs, but for cleaning standard rugs and carpets it is useless."
5,Love it,"I was a little nervous about buying the Hoover Tempo Widepath after some of the reviews, but I have to say I love it. I have been using it for the last month. It is very powerful and easy for me to move around. I even have to take it upstairs and I don't have a problem. Better than the one that cost me $400.00."
3,good deal,"Ordered this because of its good ratings. It works great, has great suction, and the air doesn't blow directly out of the front so it doesnt blow dirt away on bare floors. The only thing is that I wish this one had the option to shut the brushes off. That being said I am really impressed with how great it picks stuff up and it seems like a great value.Okay a year and a half later I am updating my review and moving it to 3 stars from 4. For the past several months I have noticed it leaves a musty odor in the air, even with changing the filter and bags, and it is getting worse. It still has great suction, but the smell is making it aweful to use. I guess for the price I got my use out of it, but I hate to replace a working vacuum because of smell, but I have to."
4,Cheap sweeper cleans up,Bargain sweeper that works. We use it at our buisness. It gets used and abused by all the employees. Works great and when it dies I buy a new one. Why pay three times the money for a fancy sweeper that doesnt do any better job?
4,"A bit loud, but very powerful!","This is an AWESOME value. I'm loving it's cleaning power so far. It is a bit loud, as stated, but that a good trade-off for the price and performance."
4,Great quality for price!,"This was a great purchase for the price. I was a bit apprehensive because you usually get what you pay for, but I was plesantly surprised. The only downside to this item is the placement of the cord. It is near the bottom of the back of the vacuum so sometimes it gets in the way. Otherwise, love it!"
4,Works well for the price,"The vacuum came within 3 days of ordering (way to go Amazon!) and we desperately needed to use it THAT night. My husband was excited to give it a whirl and after one quick swipe, the belt broke. Hoover was great and replaced the belt the next day, but we are fortunate to live within a few miles of a Hoover repair center. Otherwise, I think we would have had to pay shipping charges for something that broke almost as soon as we plugged it in.That said, the vacuum works great. It is noisier than other vacuums I have had, but that's probably because it's so powerful. I saw someone complain about the cord length and I think it's just the same as any other vacuum. I would definitely recommend it if this is your price range (because under $75 is mine!)"
5,Works great!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner based on the reviews (85% 4 and 5 star) on Amazon. So far it has worked very well! I think it does a splendid job for the price. The best part is that it cleans bare floors pretty well. Of course there are vacuums that perform better and have a lot of fancy functions, but they also cost a few hundred bucks!"
3,Basic Vacumn Cleaner,"This is a basic vacumn cleaner. No bells, no whistles, not even a light. It does a good job on carpets and adequate on hard floors. The major draw backs: the cord is too short; the switch is in a bad place."
1,hoover tempo widepath vacuum,"I have found this vacuum much too heavy to push around. Less importantly, it is very very noisy. I would also have preferred a wind-up cord feature. I would not recommend this product."
2,good enough,"It does the job. All plastic parts. Front cover keeps falling off. As long as you don't mind that, I does a pretty good job."
2,Tempo Vacuum,The Hoover Tempo is NOT well constructed. THere is minor assembly required but the cord storage is awkward and seems misplaced. Not accustomed to this poor quality from Hoover.
4,U5140 Tempo Vacuum,"I have a long-haired, white cat. This is a great vacuum cleaner for getting her hair off things."
3,Cheap Vacuum,"The best thing I can say about this vacuum is it is cheap. I have replaced the belt four times in the five months I have owned it. It seems as though the belt overheats and stretches out if you use it too long at a time. I must need a heavy duty vacuum so I am still rating it 3 stars for people who don't have much carpet. It does have great suction though, but don't plan on using the hose with the attachments because it is short and doesn't stretch much."
1,BROKE the 2nd time we used it,"I thought Hoover is a great brand and thought $75 was a steal for this highly rated vacuum cleaner (Consumer Reports rated this one a ""best buy""). I read all the great reviews, and felt good buying this vacuum, but it literally BROKE the second time I used it. There was a ribbon hiding under the edge of the couch - the ribbon immediately got caught and the agitator belt snapped. I know these things aren't supposed to be bullet proof, but geez, consumers be warned - you'd better not have any socks or ribbons or whatnot hiding under your couches."
3,Hoover Tempo Widepath Uprighy Vacuum US140-900,"Before purchasing this product, I read several opinions, most of which complained about noise and shortness of hose. The noise factor is of little concern to me, but the shortness of the hose is utterly ridiculous, rendering it of no value in attempting various cleaning jobs. I believe you are aware of this serious shortcoming , since you offer for sale a much longer hose. HOWEVER, I offer a solution to this shortcoming - namely, that you offer the extended length hose at a sale price with free shipping!!!"
3,Widepath Tempo,"The hose is just ridiculously short and, due to suction, gets even shorter when you use an attachment! I can barely get it into a drawer at my waist level! If you want a reasonable length hose, you have to special order it. Did anyone test this first? Suction is good, though, so it's a trade-off. You keep a vacuum for years, though, so you shouldn't have to put up with a hose that's only 30""."
4,Little Plastic Marvel,Pros: Great for the price. Easy to assemble. Good suction. Attachments included. Light weight. Almost self-propelled.Cons: Small filter bag. Short hose. Not gentle on rugs when new.
4,HEAVY,"Works great. But, its very Heavy. Not a big deal unless you need to cart it up and down stairs..."
2,It's OK as long as it doesn't get caught,"Every time the vacuum gets caught on a carpet, drapes, clothing, etc..., the brush belt snaps broken. Had the vacuum for 6 months and am on my third belt. Other than that works fine for a great price."
3,Good basic vacuum,"I wanted a very basic vacuum for small jobs around the house (we do not have a lot of carpet in our house), so I decided not to spend a lot at this time. This is not perfect, but for the price, I think it delivers what it should. My only ""wish"" for it is that the hose be longer. As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, when you use the hose to do upholstery and such, it doesn't reach very far before the vacuum begins to tip forward. Aside from that, I got what I needed from this vacuum."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON BARE FLOORS!,"If you are buying this to use on carpet than it does an OK job. If you are buying this to use on wood floors or any other type of bare floors, it DOES NOT WORK! I've tried contacting Hoover and they don't care and will do nothing to help me. I am stuck with a vacuum that doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do. I took it in for service and there is nothing wrong with it. It just doesn't do what it is advertised to do! False advertisement. After dealing with the people at the Hoover service center, I can honestly say that I will NEVER purchase another Hoover product again! Customer service alone helped me make that decision. Don't buy Hoover."
2,4 year life span,"At first this vacuum had so much power that it practically ran away from me. Within the first year, its performance dwindled. I finally replaced it this week after going over and over and over the carpet and having no suction whatsoever. I changed bags a lot, used all of the different settings, but it was a major disappointment. It would not pick up lint. It was especially poor at picking up debris from a carpet runner sitting atop our carpet.I really hoped it would outlast my supply of bags, but that was not to be. I expected more from the American brand that's been synonymous with vacuuming, but this product's performance declined to the point of uselessness. Four years of waning performance is unacceptable."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vaccuum,"This is an excellent product for getting dirt off and out of the carpet. It has great suction and is very light. The hose and wand setup is stiff and hard to pull out and put back in, but if you have carpets throughout the house this one will do the job. We have 2 dogs and a cat and it gets the hair off my bed...I just lift up this very light vacuum and go for it. The price is very easy on the wallet also. Great as a second vacuum cleaner too. I like to clean and I want different features for different things and this one fits the wallet and bill."
4,So far so good,"I've had this for about a month now, the suction is amazing compared to my last two cheap vacuums and the attached tools are easy to use. I'm really pleased with it so far, but intend to update if anything goes wrong."
4,The Missus Loves It,"Probably the best gift I've ever given her, judging by her smile. Don't worry ladies, it wasn't for her birthday or anything important. It was just because she needed one.It looks like a slightly lighter and cheaper version of a Hoover I keep at my ""bachelor pad""; it even uses the same type bag. Sucks well and pulls hard -- hmmm, I wonder Amazon allows double entendres...Arrived quickly, before a book I ordered on the same day. So all in all, it's been a pretty sweet deal so far. If it holds up, I may give it another star."
3,Does it's job,"PROS: It's a good sucker. It's cheap in price and light in weightCONS: Hose sometimes come off, It's easily bent. Pretty loud. Wish the extension cord was a bit longer."
2,Hoover,"The bags are very small, so fill up quickly. The vacuum leaves little balls all over that I have to pick up."
3,It does good job on cleaning.,"It has great suction and really picks up the dog hair. The downfall is that the cord is short, so you have to chance outlets alot. Also the hose is short and not very fexible and when using it with the attachments, it tends to come lose easy. I would probably not buy this model again."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum Bagged,"Great vacuum for the price. Covers a wide area. Good suction. Tubes are plastic, so you have to stretch them out to get them to stay. On/off switch is down low on top of the bag cover. Electric cord is down towards the bottom, so you have to wrap it up around the top cord rung to prevent it from going under the vacuum."
3,Hoover,"Recommended, very good on carpets. Purchased due to Consumers Report's performance & price. A little noisy as indicated,would rate it higher if not better than my higher priced Dirt Devil."
1,rotating brush ruined every carpet in my home,I have owned this vacuum for a couple of years. I have had to change 2 area rugs thinking they weren't made well and am finally realizing it's this awful vacuum!! The rotating brush is so coarse that is makes every rug in your home look like an afro. It just frizzes up everything in its path. It made so many pulls on my area rug too. It doesn't matter which setting you put it on - the brush still rotates and touches the carpet. I'm so mad at myself for being such a cheapskate and buying this thing!! Never again!
1,IF YOU LIKE CHANGING BELTS...,"You'll love this vacuum! With a new belt, it works great. But I'm changing belts constantly. I'm lucky to get 3 vacuums out of this bugger without changing them. And its not a snap to change either. I would NOT recommend this vacuum. And I will never buy a Hoover again. I had previously had a Dirt Devil which finally died after years of use and bought a Hoover as I grew up with one. My mother had one that lasted for 30 years (and I never saw her change a belt), so I felt this was a good choice... WRONG! My next purchase will be a Dirt Devil. This vacuum is just too much work to deal with."
1,Munsters,"I bought this machine earlier this year, it worked well for the first 6 months, now it reminds me of the Munster's vacuum dispersing dust all over the place."
1,It sucks alright!,"Despite the rave reviews, it's a piece of junk. Falls apart easily, poor design and I can feel it whipping dirt against my legs as I vacuum. Spend a little more money and get something good."
3,Quality is lacking,"I have had the vacuum a year now. The power cord has always been in the way, I have placed it in the channel and it doesn't stay. The tubing kinks easy and is very then. As for the suction it is been comparable to my Kirby. I probably would not buy again."
3,easy to use,"It seems to clean well, it's very lightweight and easy to push around, but it is very noisy. For the price, it's a pretty good deal."
3,Nice hoover,This hoover is nice looking - works great on carpet - great for pet hairs - works ok on wooden floor but it does not work on a tiled floor.
4,Good value,"This self propelled vacuum was a great buy. It doesn't have bells and whistles, but it's easy to use and has good suction for all flooring (from hardwood to high profile carpet). The bags are relatively easy to change (emphasis on relative -- since when are vacuum bags ever easy to change?). We've had two broken belts, not abnormal for our amount and time of use. Replacement was pretty straight forward but requires screwdriver and scissors (to cut away all the long hair that gets wrapped around the axel/brush). It's not pleasant, but that's because of my long locks that shed like crazy, not due to the vacuum's operation.In general, I would recommend this product for its ease of use, functionality and durability. It was definitely worth the price as it cleans better than some of the higher end products."
4,dog and 4 long haired teen girls,We have a lot of hair and stuff in our house of 7. Very light and love the bagged vaccuum.
3,belt went after 1 week!!!,"..I really do like my Hoover and it was a very good price but I have 2 things against it. 1: The belt broke a week after I received it--I had only vacuumed 3 times! How can a new belt break that soon,I ask you.? I am not the only one who has written in about the belt. Are we supposed to just say ""Oh well..the price was right!"" ? I do not think so. Maybe if we complain enough the company will not cheat others with a cheap belt to begin with! 2: it is very awkward to pick up and down when doing stairs. I still want my Kenmore canister to be fixed so until then I will use this. Yes, the suction is good! But if it keeps breaking belts I will junk it."
4,invest in extra belts,"We have had this vacuum for 4 months now. I couldn't believe the power of this machine when we first got it, then about a month ago the only thing that would work is the handheld hose. Oh great, we thought we got a lemon. We took the screws off the bottom and sure enough the belt had already broken. We replaced it and it's like new again. I love the suction, its lightweight for lugging up and down stairs, and simple design that my kids can use. The cord could be longer, it could be quieter, and yeah, the belts could last longer, but just buy some extra while you're purchasing this and you should be fine. I still think it's an excellent value~I've never had a vacuum work better."
3,"Good, but not great","Hoover is okay, but have to set on lowest setting in order to pick up anything. We have a poodle and it does not pick up his fur."
3,"Fine, but loud and doesn't get edges well","This vacuum has a TON of power, but I don't feel like it works well in corners and on wood or bare floors. It's a little over a year later and I am already looking for an upgrade. I would like something quieter, and maybe a little sturdier. The hose with this is too short and I got the longer hose. Even with that, the vacuum falls over when I try to reach more than 4 feet from the vac. It's strong and not a terrible purchase for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for. I want a nice grown up vacuum now!"
5,Great Product - Small Price,I love this vacuum. It is priced reasonably and works very well. Since I have allergies I prefer a bagged vacuum. I have 2 floors at my house and need a vacuum on both floors. I already bought 1 one these vacuums several years ago and am now buying another one to keep on a different floor. I heartily recommend it.
3,Heavy buy ok,This is a heavy vaccuum which I dont like but it works ok and has a good price. Sucks up ok. And seems to be pretty reliable.
2,Not such a great deal,It's cheap but it doesn't pick up well at all on bare floors. The edge cleaning is poor. My 20 year-old Sharp was better by far. There's no good way to recoil the cord so it's left half-dangling. Carpet pick up is better but again edges get the short shrift.
2,worked great for about a day,"I loved this vacuum for the few hours it worked. Then the motor started to sputer and it smelled like it was burning. I did all the trouble shooting to try and fix it but nothing worked. There are no Hoover repair shops near me, so I would have to pay to have it shipped to get it fixed, what a disapointment."
4,Value,"Certainly worth the $49.95 that it costs. It works beautifully, albeit, a lot heavier than I expected & I would have appreciated a bagless instead.Aside from those few negatives, I am 100% satisfied with the product."
4,Best yet,I ordered this vacuum because I wanted a light weight one and also one that used a bag. Upon checking Consumer Reports I found this was a best buy and that settled the question for me. I have been using it and find it all it is supposed to be.
1,"Hoovers are junk, don't buy","I already wrote one review about how the belts break on this piece of junk all the time. Hoover told me to go jump in the lake when I e-mailed them about that.Now the vacuum hose is collapsing on me. I e-mailed them about that too and haven't heard back. I will e-mail them again, but I don't hold out much hope.If you want a good vacuum that doesn't break down all the time buy something else. I wish I had. I am about to return this piece of junk."
1,You get what you pay for,"I just used this vacuum for the first time in my apartment and I am covered with lint and dust. The exhaust just spewed it all over and I""ve had to go back with a brush and dust pan where ever possible to reclean. The vacuum is heavy, it is noisy, it is unwieldy, and it is difficult to manage the cord, the body of the vacuum, and the extension at the same time. The extension tube bunches up so it's difficult to get the full length of it, and under the bed, where the big thing doesn't fit, the brush on the extension tub is way too small to do a good job. I have only used uprights a few times and am going to get myself a high quality, more expensive vaccuum that I test out in a store. I'm sending this one back as soon as it stops snowing."
1,Very poor for dog hair,"I just received this vacuum and after reading some reviews about it being good for dog hair I thought I had found a good value. It is terrible at picking up dog hair. I had to go over the same spot 17 times and it still did not pick up all the dog hair. I vacuum my rugs every 2-3 days. I have two dogs, one with wiry white hair (Jack Russell). My old, cheap, Eureka Boss that I've had for ten years as an ""extra"" does a better job than this new Hoover Widepath. The moveable lever in the front, to go from HIGH to hardwood floors is cheap plastic and feels like it is going to break; I couldn't even get it to move. Very, very cheap, plasticky..don't buy this one. Someone just told me that he bought an inexpensive Bissell and it is great. He said he paid under $100. If I could find one that wouldn't aggravate my tendinitis AND pick up dog hair, I'd pay any price."
1,How long has Hoover been making vacuums?,The Tempo worked fairly well at first but after 6 months it no longer sucks. Also the cord wrap blocks the hose. You have to unwind the cord completely to get to the hose. The brush doesn't stop moving on the bare floor setting so it shoots all the dirt back at your ankles while you use it. It smells like it is going to catch fire after 4 minutes of use too. It is a HUGE pile!
4,not too bad,"i read some bad reviews about this vacuum and was a little hesitant to buy it but i have had it for about three or four years now and it's pretty good. it picks up nicely but the belts seem to break quite often. otherwise it would say 5 stars. pretty light, the cord could be longer, but overall, there is a lot of crappy vacuums out there so i would recommend buying this one over others."
1,It was all right until it stopped working.,"It worked for almost a year. First 6 months, we had to empty the bag every month and our house is only 1000 square feet. A few months later, it totally stopped sucking."
2,Good to start then burns !,"Worked well for 12 months of light use (single bed room, weekly once)... and then burns and horrible customer service of Amazon / Hoover didn't do a thing about it.Do they expect us to buy a $75 vacuum every ?? Damn.."
1,Missing part,"This item was found to have a missing part. When I contacted the Hoover helpline, I was advised to return it. Sorry, really wanted to love this but didn't even get a chance to try it out."
3,its ok,"The hose is too short & the attachments are just straight, so you can't hardly maneuver into nooks and crannys.It's bulky & big, & not of the quality I would expect for the price."
1,never received the item,"I ordered the vacuum, and was billed for it, but it never arrived. I spoke to a very helpful customer service person who found the item just sitting in and Amazon warehouse. She credited my credit card."
1,Reports Say Hoover Has Sold It's Patents and Name to China,"I have not bought this vacuum. I had to rate it so I picked one star. Here is why I am writing. More and more, products that were high-quality at one point have fallen off a cliff. The name is the same, but the product doesn't work as well as people have come to expect from the brand. I found this when shopping for an iron about six months ago. The reviews showed that while Rowenta irons were reliably good and lasted a long time, more recent versions were junk. This may be the same with this product. Here is a link to a website that explains what might have happened with Hoover. [...]. If you read it, you'll see the blogger claims Hoover has sold its patents and brand name to China."
2,invest in a better vaccuum,"This vaccuum is okay for the money but I would wish I would have invested in a better quality vaccuum. The attachments are always falling off the back and I am constantly searching for them. In addition, the vaccuum flexible ""pipe"" is not that long so I find that I must lift the whole vaccuum to reach places I need to vaccuum....Not convenient at all."
4,Great for carpets,"Great suction, powerful brush. A bit noisy. Not for use on bare floors - on ""bare floor"" setting the vac's brush keeps going and throws everything around before it has a chance to suck it up. Be sure to have some replacement belts on hand - unless you actually want to vacuum bare floors, in which case a broken belt might help."
1,cheap vacuum,"This vacuum is the cheap piece of junk. When you try to use the hose the suction collapses the hose. The accessory pieces don't stay together when you try to extend the wand. I took a chance on an inexpensive vacuum and that's what I got ""A Cheap Vacuum"".Now we're in the market for a new one, what a waste."
2,"extremely loud, too powerful","I purchased this vacuum due to the great price and reviews, but am not pleased. I have hardwood floors and a cat, and when I clean around the cat's litter, it shoots the litter all over the room making me do even more work in the end. I would have to remove the detachable nozzle and manually clean up the cat litter. Also, the vacuum is very powerful and shredded some wires that were too close to me while cleaning - something that has never been a problem before. In addition, this vacuum is extremely loud - to the point where it makes my ears ring. The whole neighborhood knew I had gotten a new vacuum. My boyfriend has had enough of the noise and we are shopping for a new one."
1,"Sadly, the worst vacuum cleaner I have owned!","Based on a combination of our specific needs and a very positive Consumer Reports rating we purchased the Hoover Tempo. It was immediately evident that we had made a serious mistake. The vacuum cleaner blows air from each of it's sides at the bottom, which sends dust flying around the room. If we get anywhere near the fireplace, unless the vacuum cleaner is pointed directly toward it, this same blast of air sends ashes spiraling out of the fireplace and throughout the living room. This makes the vacuum cleaner useless, which is probably just as well as the noise level is so high and it is extremely difficult to push over our rugs. After about a dozen attempts to use it, the cleaner stopped picking up all together except through the hose attachments. I guess the bright side of this is that we no longer have a layer of ash on our rugs. Needless to say, we are off Hoover products now."
4,Belt Broke,Had two busted belts in less than a month. None since then (almost a year). Works great and picks up almost anything.
5,Agree with most reviewers - Best Choice,Worth every penny.I cannot think of anything bad about this vaccum cleaner for the price.
5,Great Buy,"I purchased this Hoover, after having a Dirt Buster vacuum, for less than a year. When I received it, I immediately started using it, on a newly installed carpet. I was totally impressed, by its suction power, even with the attachment hose, for edges and ledges. I would recommend this product, to anyone who is looking for a reasonably inexpensive, efficient vacuum cleaner. It is well worth the price I paid."
3,decent,I guess you get what you paid for. It worked fine although after sometime the handle came right off. I had to duct tape it to keep it intact while vacuuming until I got around purchasing another vacuum.
5,It's doing its job after 3 years!,"This is a low priced version which has the power of its fancy brother. No light, no cord rewind, etc. But, it does its job and has fewer gizmos to break."
2,Not very useful.,"It is noisy. noise aside, there are many drawbacks. Even after running this unit on the same place for a long time, i am still able to pick hair, dirt from the carpet just by hand. As another reviewer said, it is not useful for hardwood also, air coming out of the side of the unit blows more dirt. hand tools are connected by a short hose, which makes it very difficult to operate."
2,Loud,"For the price, this vacuum cleaner is a good deal. The beaters are good on wall to wall carpeting, but I find it extremely loud. The beaters rotate constantly, making it almost seem self-propelled, which makes it easy to push on carpeting. However, I worry what that would do to the finish on wooden floors. The brush adjustment height seems to do nothing."
5,Good Vacuum,I recently bought the Hoover Tempo Widepath vacuum and have been very happy with it. The vacuum has excellent suction and the wide path makes getting along the walls very easy. The only thing I miss from my canister vacuum days is the retractable cord.
4,SUPER SUCTION,Cant beat this vacuum for the price. Only had it a short time and used it 3 times...But the suction on this vacuum is great. Ideal for me because I use it and leave it on my 2nd floor instead of lugging my cannister up and down.
4,Hoover tools easy to use.,I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hose is permanently installed in the vacuum and makes using the tools quicker and easier along with good suction. My old Hoover's hose was separate and had to be inserted at bottom of machine. Good change. Did not find the noise level offensive. Good buy for the money.
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath Vacuum U5140-900,Consumer Reports gave this machine a high rating. Ordered it from Amazon for a good price. It actually arrived the next day!
3,A little disappointed,"I had already purchased another Widepath, and was extremely happy with it. I own a motel, so I purchased a new one as the first one got so much use. This one had a part broken off when I opened the box and doesn't seem to be as good as the first one: it has great suction but blows a lot of the dirt back out onto my feet and I can't figure out why. Maybe I just got a dud as these are wonderful vacuums ordinarily. I still think it's better than the way-more expensive Oreck, however."
4,GREAT PICK UP,"This is a nice vacuum for the price. The suction is great, but the hose is a little time consuming. We are planning on buying a 40' camper and I will buy one of these to take on the road with us. Great Buy!!!"
5,Hoover Vac,Great suction and lighter than most. Tool hose is a little short but I've heard that you can buy a optional extension. Suction is so good it has a tendancy to grab onto small area rugs. The tradeoff for a clean rug more than makes up for resetting a few area rugs. The one I bought was very inexpensive and the shipping was fast. You have to assemble some of the parts but its done quickly with a minimum of tools required. There mighy be better ones but they are twice the price and weight. I'm VERY HAPPY with this one.
4,Great for occasional use...,"This is not our ""workhorse"" main floor vacuum. I bought this vacuum to keep in our upstairs closet to vacuum without lugging our main vacuum upstairs. Works great but the cord is a little short for my taste. It really does do a great job at picking up cat & dog hair though. It seems a little flimsy so I don't think it could stand up to the daily vacuuming on our main floor but it's great for the occasional (couple times a week) use that it it gets in our house."
4,Great value,"This vacuum cleaner works great for me. It sucks well. My gripes are all minor: I wish the hose for cleaning edges, etc. was a little longer, and I wish the bag was a little bigger. And I'd gladly pay $10-$20 more if this wasn't made in Commie China. The vacuum is also a little on the noisy side, but so what? Since when is vacuuming supposed to be quiet? I paid a mere $60 for this SHIPPED and for the last 6 months it's done the job. Just buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Awesome vacuum,"I researched vaccuums for about 2 hours before deciding on this one. I wanted a bagged vaccuum b/c it seemed that the bagless created more mess when you empty them and a lot of them have expensive HEPA filters to replace. I wanted to spend less than $100 also. I decided to play the odds and get this vaccuum. So far I have only used it once, but it works amazing. It sucks stuff up powerfully on my laminate floors and on my high-pile area rugs. You can even change the level of the vaccuum based on the floor type. When you select high pile, it's easy to vaccuum flimsy area rugs. I am very VERY happy with my purchase and just hope that it keeps up for the next few years. I definitely recommend this vaccuum. It is lightweight, easy to put together, and overall really easy to use."
4,Good Overall,"To the point:Pros:Excellent at picking up dog hair from bare floors, rugs.Not too heavy, very maneuverable, easy to carry around and to storeExcellent priceCons:Air blows out of left side and makes you work a little harder in hallways and near wallsHose mode not very easy to use, some tools fall out of their storage placeChanging bags is a bit trickyDoes not go under furniture (problematic because hose and wand feature is not easy to use)Overall it is a good product. Problems are not difficult to overcome. If cord is short or I want to minimize plugins I use 16 foot extension cord. For under furniture that cannot be moved easily, I use the Hoover brand small cannister type vac that I bought 27 years ago. Hoover is a good brand."
3,Hoover Tempo Widepath U5140-900,"I ordered this vacuum, believing that it had a headlight and a full bag indicator light as was shown in the product information. When I received the vacuum it had neither the headlight or the full bag indicator light. It looks like a much cheaper version of the vacuum represented in the advertisement. The vacuum works fine, but I still feel as though I have been ripped off, by false representation."
3,Good vacuum on a budget,"Price 5 stars. It's a bit flimsy, especialy the hose. the belt broke after three uses, replaced it and now running fine. Overall for the price, it's a pretty good vacuum for those on a tight budget."
4,Excellent for the price,"I considered spending up to about $500 but after several hours of research determined that I didn't want to ""gamble"" so much money when reviews did not greatly differ between $80 vacuums and those greater than $500. The only improvements needed are a longer and more flexible hose and a longer floor brush fitting at least 8 inches long. Suction power is awesome, it moves well, and is light weight. Very pleased!"
2,Tempo-NOT SO GOOD,The Vacuum arrived in 2 days. The height adjustment on this vacuum is not very good if you have high pile rugs. The vacuum itself is very good with great suction. If you have expensive rugs I suggest you buy another model.
2,Missing Piece,"I bought this vacuum and one of the extensions was missing. I didn't have time to wait for an exchange, so I returned it and got the Dirt Devil Breeze bagged vacuum at my local Target. Quality-wise the Breeze it seemed to be the same but it was half the price, not to mention much lighter and more maneuverable!"
2,Not the value you think it is,I bought this thinking it was a great value. What I got was a vacuum cleaner that often pushes dirt around instead of vacuuming it. And the bag compartment is so small (much smaller than the actual bag) that you are constantly changing the bag. I wouldn't buy this vacuum cleaner again.
1,Disappointed with purchase,"Disappointed with the vacuum performance. The belt has been broken twice in six month. I have a high pile carpet and it does not do a very good job to cleaning it deep. Also, bare floor cleaning just does not work. It just keeps on throwing stuff at the back of the vacuum (you can feel it if you vacuum with bare feet). Also, yesterday it started smelling of burned rubber with some smoke coming out of it. Called the customer service, and they won't replace it. They advised me to take it to one of the warranty repair center - the nearest one is 20 miles away :-)."
4,Great value,"I got this vacuum after buying and returning a more expensive one. This vacuum is small and simple but it is mighty. We are so glad we got it and what a great price! We only have 3 small bedrooms to vacuum so it works fine for us. Not sure how it would hold up if we needed to use it more frequently and for a larger space. You have to assemble it yourself when it arrives, but I found that to be fairly easy. Lightweight and durable."
2,Significant problems,"No way to turn off the spinner while using hand-held attachments. The heat from the spinner partially melted our area run in three places while my wife was cleaning the sofa. Good deal on this vacuum cost us a $300 rug. If you're careful with it, though, it may be adequate.The belt broke on third usage, but hopefully will work better with replacement."
4,Great Vaccuum! Highly Recommended,"This is a great vacuum that works a lot better than any fancy one. Even with its bulkiness, it's quite easy to maneuver and has amazing sucking power. Great price, great quality. Would be nice if it was a little more compact."
5,Great Vacuum,"I bought this vacuum because of the great review in Consumer Reports magazine. It's a great product. It handles well, and weighs less than other vacuums. It's great for pet hair. I highly recommend this product."
4,great vacuum,"this vacuum is a great vacuum for the money,the only reason i did'nt give it 5 stars is if you vacuum next to any dust it will blow the dust, but it really is not a problem.the best part is the vacuum is light and pushes easily."
4,"Pretty good cleaner, great price","I've had my cleaner for a couple months now and have been pleased. In general, it does a better job than my old Dirt Devil, is much quieter, and cost me about the same amount. The bag check feature on the front is convenient, and the wider path is nice. My only complaint is that it doesn't pick up stuff so well when I push it up against the edges of walls and furniture, but the attachments are easy to use and they work well. I would definitely recommend the cleaner if you want something relatively inexpensive that works well."
5,Love This Vacuum!!,"I love this new vacuum. It is so powerful you must be careful not to tear your rugs. It is loud, but works great, picks up the smallest particles and is easy to maneuver and clean. The hose is very short, but I don't use that much. Would buy this one again and recommend to others."
4,Great vacuum for the price,"I have owned this vacuum for about a year now. I have been very impressed with the performance of the vacuum for both regular vacuuming and ""edging"" along the walls. Our last vacuum cost 3-4 times as much and this vacuum performs just as well as our old vacuum. I gave this four stars instead of five as the only criticism I have would be the power cord is attached at the bottom of the vacuum which can get in the way more than the vacuum I had where the power cord was higher up the handle. Just need to get used to holding it up."
1,Piece of Junk,If I could leave less than one star I would. This is without a doubt the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used. After the first few passes the hose will crimp and collapse and then there is no suction. You have to shut it off and unkink it and start again. What it does manage to suck up gets clogged in the tube so you have to take it apart ( you will need a screwdriver) and clean it out. Vacuuming a 12 x 12 carpeted room took me 40 minutes. Even after that it didn't look very clean so I did it over again but this time with a broom. Felt like I was back in the 18th century but I finally had a clean carpet! Consumer reports dropped the ball on this one. Do not buy.
5,"It is light weight, very easy to ensemble and works well picking up.",Great sweeper for the price. If you are looking for an affordable sweeper and one that is light weight and does the job you'll like this one. It is nothing fancy.
5,Great for any home,"I've had experience with quite a few vacuums (kirby, dirt devil, generic pieces of crap, etc), and this one is the best so far. Suction is great, it's powerful and does get to those corners well. I actually like where the on/off button is, it's really easy for me to reach. I've only had it about 2 months, but I have nothing but praises for it. It's quite light, which is good for smaller folks like me who can't lift 100 ton vacuums. Assembly instructions were easy and quick, and I feel like I could quickly and effectively change or fix the belt should it ever break or malfunction (which it hasn't so far). Overall, it does a great job, just as good as any other bagged vaccuum, in my opinion. I hope this review helps someone because the previous ones helped me to pick this product. Thanks!"
2,"Fine on carpet, but not on hardwood","This vacuum has a ""bare floor"" setting, but it does a terrible job on my hardwood floors. It just blows around the dirt. However, it works quite well on my rugs, with one caveat. It's marketed as a ""wide path"" but it seems to me that the outer edges don't have much suction. If you're buying this stictly for carpet, I would recommend it. You can't beat the price. Otherwise, look elsewhere.The first vacuum I received had a hole in the cord, and I have to say that Amazon's customer service was superb. They responded immediately, and within a few days, I had another vacuum, no hassles and no questions asked. You don't find that kind of service very often."
4,Inexpensive and Works Fine,"Our 6-year old Panasonic died (motor armature burned out) and we replaced it with this Hoover. Weight and performance are comperable to the old Panasonic ($160 new) and it's an incredible bargain at $60. I am giving it only 4 stars because although it's about as loud as the Panasonic, the sound is higher-pitched and is, to my ears, more annoying. No problems so far after 6 weeks of use."
3,Great for a couple of months,"I bought this vacuum cleaner because of the high ratings and great price. It worked wonderfully at first, but soon began to lose steam. I took it in for repairs (which cost about the same as buying it originally). Since then its been okay, but not great."
3,Hoover Tempo Widepath Vacuum,Very loud. The hose keeps popping off it's holder. Good suction though. The cord is not situated very conveniently to be wound up.
2,just okay,I thought I was getting a great product considering the ratings. this vacuum is very average and does not have the suction capacity that the better more expensive vacuums have.
4,Good value,"This product is a good buy...obviously it isn't a top of the line vacuum. But, it has very good suction and that is my priority as the owner of two dogs."
4,Replaced Old Hoover Vacuum,I was pleased with my old Hoover vacuum so I purchased this one. I don't vacuum as often as I should but when I do I am pleased with the performance of this Hoover vacuum.
3,Okay performance for low cost,"If you're looking for a vacuum that does the job, but with no bells and whistles, this is for you. This vacuum has good suction. It's a bit noisier than others and the brushes do not stop spinning when using the hose which causes a higher pitched sound. The cord is stored in an awkward position behind the hose. I would recommend this as a starter vacuum or for someone who just wants the job done."
1,Belt breaks and comes off every time I vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum because of the cheap price and great reviews, but I got so frustrated this morning that I physically kicked it. Every single time I vacuum the belt either comes off or it breaks. Otherwise it worked fine, but I'm buying a different vacuum now!"
2,"Not the ""Best Buy"" that I'd hoped for","I purchased this particular make/model because it was noted as a ""Best Buy"" by Consumer Reports. However, the product hasn't lived up to what I'd expected because it simply doesn't vacuum up all that's on the floor/carpet, and it is very difficult to get them entirely clean in just one or two pass overs. I regret having purchased this particular model, but you can never know until you get it home, and I trusted the ""Best Buy"" rating."
5,Best bang for the buck,"Pros:- Highly rated by consumer reports- Great suction - cleans well- Lightweight- reat ligth for cleaning under tables or in dark areas/corners- Easy to replace bag- Good filtering- Easy to push/pull to and froCons- Loud (thorugh I think this is directly proportional to the suction capability)Other notes- Regardless of your vacuum, be sure to clean out (long) hairs that get wrapped up in the rollers or your rubber belt with have to work harder and wear out more quickly."
1,Regret Buying This Vacuum,"I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said the vacuum did poorly on bare floors. This vacuum has been completly useless to us becasue most of floors are hard wood. It performed much better on our Persian style rug, but sucked up our heavy throw rugs (whereas our previous vacuum did not).I wish we could return it."
1,terrible,The belt broke 3 times in one week and no I didnt get anything caught in it. I have a low carpet. The hose has a dent in it that promises to soon become a hole. I can only use the attachment to vacuum as the floor vacuum just stopped working one day. this product totally sucks and you get what you pay for.
3,Hose scrunched up,"I was moved to write this review after seeing the last image or the scrunched up hose. The same thing happened to me and now I can use any of the attachments. Every time the hose scrunches up, I lose significant suction. the vacuum works fine if you don't strech out the hose. I think my hose was initially damaged due to my attempt at reaching a longer distance than the hose allowed. Now, I'm in the market for a new vacuum and will likely go with a detachable base which allows more portability."
1,big disappointment,"Bought this vacuum a year ago based on posiive reviews. Doesn't pick up dirt on bare floors and leaves dog hair remaining on rugs. We vacuum, then clean the carpet - amazing the amount of dog hair (one small dog that minimally sheds) remaining on the carpet when we use the carpet cleaner.Looking to buy a better vacuum soon."
4,Thieves at Amazons changed the price,"Amazon surprised me. In the space of one hour they jacked the price of this item over $20.00. I put it in my shopping cart at the library on their pc, went home to buy it on mine and noticed the huge increase, the reps I contacted gave excuses that their subvendors were carrying the item for less and that I must have selected the wrong item. Wrong! Boldfaced Lie Amazon! Bah Humbug!Addendum: I bought this item from Amazon anyway. It arrived quickly in two days. I used it immediately out of the box. Its cheaply made, required me to use the setting above bare floors for my carpet, and the tools kept falling off but its not a bad cleaner. I think more thought should have been given to where to place the cord which doesnt wrap neatly around all the easily popping off tools. I dont hear it sucking up the dirt but it seems to work ok. The motor is very very loud."
1,Piece of crap,"This piece of crap arrived with a broken belt. Now I have to order a belt to see if this product works - needless to say I'm not optimistic. I tried to go cheap since I have a small place, live alone, and so don't vacuum a lot. Big mistake. Buy quality. This product is not worth your money or your time. I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Good Product,Recommended by consumer reports and it lives up to the expecatation. Good reliable product
4,SUPER FAST SHIPPING!,"I ordered it on 5th July and it arrived on 6th July..I got the Standard shipping free(3-5 days).Really pleased!Struggled a bit with the assembly,the cover did not seem to align exactly..But once I got the hang of it,it was pretty easy.Used it yesterday for the first time..Very happy with the results as of now. Good suction,not very noisy in my opinion(TV was audible!) and love the light. My carpet feels soft,fluffy & clean today!!"
5,Don't hesitate...buy it!!!,"At $59.99, this is the best vacuum cleaner I ever owned. Even at $200+ it would be worth it. It is almost self-propelled; very simple to push. This vacuum cleaner really sucks!!! That's a good thing by the way :-)"
1,The worst vaccum I have ever seen,I bought this vaccum about a year ago because Consumer Reports rated it very high. Unfortunately this thing never worked well even once. It eats up my carpet but for some reason cannot even pick up visible dirt. The carpet it ate and the hair it picked up (to some degree) got tangeld up with the brush so there was this strong burning smell every time I tried to use it. After about 5 times of use the thing finally bit the dust. Absolutely the worst vaccum cleaner I have ever had.
2,Not such a great deal!!!,"We purchased this Hoover U5140-900 a few months ago. I use it about once a week and have had to change the belt on it at LEAST 5 TIMES!!! We are not happy with this vacuum because of this. When it does work, however, it does have good suction."
2,flimsy and unreliable,"We like simple appliances and don't use bunches of bells and whistles. This vacuum fits the bill for us. It works beautifully and actually has such powerful suction that we need to clean our area rugs differently because it tries to suck them up. I'm thinking of getting one for our church because the price is right, too. Unfortunately, after 6 months of use, it is breaking down, just like its predecessor. The cheap plastic construction soon allows the roller brush to impact parts of the plastic frame, creating a terrible racket and eventually destroying both belt and socket for the roller. There is a reason for the low price!"
4,what a sucker,"At first,i was a little skeptical about this vacuum cleaner. The price was great.Amazon.com had the best price.After researching the reviews and consumer products guides i settled for the Hoover U5140-900.Glad i did.Great product for the price.Don't let the competition fool you,all vacuum's have the same motor.12volt.no need to spend more for a vacuum than what Amazon sells them for.Thanks Amazon for your service."
4,Cleans well but too loud,"This Hoover works pretty good, cleans carpets really well. It kinda blows dust around when it's on the floor cleaning setting though and it's soooooooo loud. But overall, it's not bad. Works much better than my last vacuum."
4,Great vacuum for the price,I bought this vacuum after the reviews that I read on Consumer Report. I didn't want to spend too much money and this seemed to be a pretty good choice. I've used it about 5 times since and as far as I know it's doing the job if not better than the one that I bought for $150 which lasted less than a year. Only thing is that extension cord does not wrap around the vacuum as well. Would definitely recommend it.
2,Flimsy Vacuum,"I am less than thrilled with my new vacuum, purchased to replace my 30 yr. old Hoover upright. This vacuum provides a powerful suction on plush carpeting. However, the vacuum is so cheaply made and has design flaws when compared to my original model. The hose design is shorter with a material that is far less flexible. The placement of the electrical cord is very poorly designed; resulting in my ""vacuuming"" the cord as it got stuck under the rotation teeth on my second day of use. This type of damage never occurred in all the years of vacuuming with my original Hoover upright. Needless to say I am most disappointed with my purchase and realize I should have picked a different model, although this vacuum was well rated in Consumer Reports."
2,heavy and difficult to use,"This vacuum is not good. It is very loud. It is very heavy. It is cumbersome to manuever. I haven't used many other vacuums, but this is NOT good for someone looking for a lightweight, quiet machine with good suck. Right now, I cannot figure out how to switch it from sucking from hose to sucking and rotating from underneath. It's not new to us either. I'm ready to throw it out of house."
3,"Price was great, but hoping for more......","June 28, 2012This vacuum was rated by consumer reports as the #5 overall upright. It does a good job with normal vacuuming and it is lightweight. As several earlier reviews state, the hose and attachments are basically useless. The hose is entirely too short and the brush seems like it could definitely do some damage while using attachments. I am going to use this for regular vacuuming, but buy something else for the stairs and furniture.***UPDATE***November 19, 2012The cheap hose ended up being too much to take. Besides it being ridiculously flimsy, it was to short to the point that it was constantly popping out and flopping all over the place. We called Hoover and they sent us a higher quality hose, free of charge; albeit too long."
4,New U5140-900 Tempo versus Wind Tunnel,"recently threw my Hoover Wind Tunnel away after being told that it would take over $200 to fix it. I had the Wind Tunnel for 5-6 years and had just gotten use to it's problems until it finally died. I did tons of research and decided on this over a Meile. What I like about the U5140-900 is: 1) The price!!!, 2) it really moves well over Berber and really thick, high plus rugs, 3) it appears to be removing the cat hair (3 cats) from the rugs, sofas, and chairs, 4) it's very light weight, and 5) the tools (so far) seem to stay attached to the vacuum while in use (a major complaint on the Wind Tunnel). Cons: 1) It didn't come with the stair cleaner attachment that my Wind Tunnel had, 2) the hose is not as long as the Wind Tunnel, 3) it feels less solid than the Wind Tunnel. So far, I am happy with the purchase and hope not to be researching vacuums again next year."
4,Great vacuum!,"We've had 2 or 3 bagless vacuums that have broken within 1-2 years after getting them. They've gotten clogged, etc. We ordered this vacuum instead and it works wonderfully! Much better than even the new bagless ones! Great buy and great deal for this wonderful vacuum!"
3,Powerful...but....,"This little Hoover has a powerful motor and offers good suction. The biggest flaw, though, is that the hose doesn't swivel, which makes using the attachments unnecessarily difficult."
3,Hoover U5140-900 Tempo,"I purchased this vacuum for my apartment. The vacuum was easy to assemble and picks up very well. The cord is shorter than I would prefer but it is long enough for the apartment. I have a problem with the front vacuum panel. I don't like how the front panel will not stay attached to the vacuum. I have to use a piece of tape to hold it on. I am not sure if it was a manufacture defect or if they are all like this. All in all, I am pleased with the vacuum. I think it is a good vacuum for the price."
4,Lots Of Vacuum for Small Price,"Got rid of my expensive, heavy Kirby and purchased this low priced, bag vacuum ($70). It has great suction & is lightweight which makes it easier to hold on the stairs. I like a bagged vacuum since it is cleaner and doesn't spread dust or junk into the air while I'm banging a bagless container on the side of my trash basket. Only drawback with this vacuum for me is the somewhat shorter attachment reach and the inability to turn off the brush rotation for wood floors. Great vacuum for the price and performance though & I would buy this again."
3,Hoover Doesnt Suck Enough,"overall good vacum however, it doesnt pick up(suck) as well as the higher priced Hoovers even though it has the same amp motor(12)"
1,You get what you pay for.,"After doing a lot of research on Consumer Reports and Amazon, I tried this vacuum to replace my old Hoover. This vacuum is one of the few that Consumer Reports rates well for under $100. As soon as I received it and tried it out...the pedal that releases the tilt broke the second time I stepped on it so the vacuum would no longer stay in the upright position on its own. I have tile and wood floors with several area rugs...I could constantly feel debris hitting my feet instead of getting sucked up into the vacuum on the hard floors, and the vacuum ate a couple of my area rugs. I am a loss as how this model has been rated so well be so many people. I returned it the very next day."
3,Too much suction!,"Never thought I'd think a vacuum was too powerful. The problem in this vacuum is that the extension hose compresses so much that it's hard to use once the motor is turned on. I even bought the 20 foot hose before I realized what was causing the problem, and the same thing happened. Nothing wrong with the hose. It's fine as long as the motor is off. Floor cleaning is great. I wish it were possible to manually turn the brushes off."
2,Disappointing and Disposable,"While this vacuum worked well in the beginning, it doesn't last. We have purchased 2 in the last 3 years. The first one worked pretty well, but the cord got damaged and we decided it was unsafe to use. So we bought it again, since it is very low-priced and seemed to work well enough on carpet. The second one has lasted just over a year. The belt is fine and the bag is installed properly, but it makes a bad burning smell. It really never did well on hardwood floors, where it would pick things up and shoot them out at my feet. It no longer picks up any pet hair on carpet and is of no use to me. I would recommend buying a vacuum with a longer warranty and better construction. It would also be nice to have a longer hose for the accessories."
5,great deal for the value,I bought this same cleaner three years ago for more than I paid this time. It still works great. For this price point vacuum it is excellent.
1,Don't Bother!,"It's been a while since I had this vacuum cleaner. It broke long before it should have. I've been using Hoover vacuums for over 30 years and this is the first Hoover that I can say was just awful. It was very loud, too loud. Sure, it cleaned for a while, then just blew out. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner. Spend a little more and get the more expensive Hoovers. You get what you pay for, and I was very disappointed in this Hoover."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I got this vacuum after having read reviews on both Amazon and Consumer Reports. Although I knew I would be getting a lower end item by paying less than $100, this product did not live up to the reputation at all. I find that it tips over easily when using the hose and attachements (even after I purchased a longer hose for this purpose) and when vacuuming on hard surfaces such as wood and tile the spinning brush just sprays debris. Because this is a lower end model, there is no adjustment to turn the brush on and off. This continues to happen no matter what height adjustment I use. The best use is for carpet and upholstery. I do not recommend it if you have any other surfaces."
5,Hoover U5140-900,"Am very pleased with this vacuum, at $70 it picks up the dog hair on my tight knit plush carpet where our other $300 vacuum would not, the low setting works best on our carpet for dog hair."
1,From a 5 star to a no start,"I was eager to write a glowing review from the moment I used first used this vacuum. It had amazing suction power and self propelled like a dream. That was yesterday. Today, it will not turn on - no power. The aggravation alone in having to disassemble, pack up and cart this vacuum cleaner to the post office rates this purchase a lone star. If you purchase, I recommend you keep the box, just in case it has to be returned."
2,Great suction but cheaply made,"Have had this vacuum for about a year and have went through 8 belts. No kidding 8. If you have remotely high carpet pile, DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM! It catches the brush and you need a new belt. Hose kinks real easy as well. Bought based on a highly rated cosumer magazine and should have spent more money. It does have great suction but too many other problems."
3,"it's no Windtunnel, and it's ear-piercing","I bought this three years ago so that we wouldn't need to drag our excellent but heavy Windtunnel up the steps. I have used it a total of maybe 20 times. It is fine on the rugs, but not nearly as good on bare floors as the Windtunnel. The biggest problem is that it emits a high-pitched whine under the usual vacuum noise. Both my husband and I find it painful to listen to. We have now relegated it to the basement, for very occasional use."
4,Vacuum,"The suction on this vacuum is really good. I was a bit disappointed with the attachment feature ... the tubing doesn't reach that far and the attachments themselves are small. However, that could be how they are all made today. I haven't purchased a new vacuum for over 15 years."
2,"good power, but hose got mangled on first day",I bought two of these due to reviews and price - and it was the only option at local Bestbuy with a bag. First day the hose got mangled badly (see picture) and has been a problem ever since. Otherwise it is fine. We use it daily in a big house with lots of folks.Look elsewhere
5,Surprised!,"I was hesitant to purchase a vacuum online but I am very happy I did. I had a old Hoover from like 20 years ago that still runs like a horse. I had purchased a other brand ""bagless"" cleaner from Wal-Mart for $100 and it was garbage! I decided to stick with the ""Hoover"" brand and went to their website. It retails for $20 more at Hoover and about the same price at Best Buy. But Amazon offered free shipping so they got my business. I am VERY happy with the Vacuum. Excellent power and does a great job!"
2,Hose and Belt problems,Belt came off first time I used. Hose collapses when you use attachments. Vacuums carpet well.
3,"Cord is way too short, otherwise it's fine for $60","My heavy, self-propelled Hoover finally gave out (after only 3 years I might add) so I purchased this lighter model based on the good reviews here, and because I hated carrying my other one up and down the stairs. This is a great vacuum for $60, but you'll see very quickly that it is indeed cheaply made. It only deserves 3 stars because the cord is so short and makes extra work for me since I cannot do more than one room at a time. My old Hoover had a much longer cord...strange."
1,Received a used vacuum,Brush assembly was loaded with a substance that looked like sheetrock dust. There was so much that it was caked on and was falling off in clumps. I had to removed the lower tray and wash and reinstall. I attempted to leave feed back but the invoice is no longer available for me to do so.
1,stopped picking up anything after a few months,"it was terrible on hardwood from day one, shoots dirt and dust all over (so make sure to wear shoes when using it if for some reason you want dirt spread all over rather than picked up). it worked great on carpet for a few months and then nothing. can't figure out why, motor still runs, belts are fine (and I've replaced the bag frequently and have extra belts if needed), but everything just stays in the hose, if it picks it up at all. very frustrating. what a waste...now I'm stuck with belts and bags for a vacuum I certainly don't want to repurchase as more than half my home is hard floors so I want one that will actually work on all my floors."
4,Good vacuum good price,A good vacuum with a great price tag. We've used it a few times so can't comment on durability but it has great sucking ability. My only complaint is with the attachment hose not being either long enough or flexible as previous hoovers I've had.
5,Hair-free carpets,"When an expensive dyson vacuum could not remove extensive cat hairs from our carpet, in desperation we ordered ths fairly inexpensive Hoover upright. It does the job in minutes, goes under furniture and counters easily, and is easy to use."
4,Satisfied,Works great for the price.suitable for large cleaning areas.worth bearing with the loud sound for the work that it does.Overall satisfied and would recommend this product.
4,solid performance,Very good vacuum at a great price. Light compared to the Eureka that I had before. A little loud but well worth the money.
4,Vacuum cleaner,"Works great. Lots of suction, easy to use controls. It's a little on the loud side, but I guess that's a byproduct of all it's power. Useful tools. It also has a very high rating from consumer reports for its' filtration system."
3,It picks up the stuff on the carpet,"reading over the options on the internet ... looking for a light weight machine ... influenced some by Epionions ... bought this and it is a satisfactory dirt sucker. One bag came with it installed and a second bag when that gets full ... so I ordered the vacuum bags pared with the machine ... have not yet filled the original. I have to buy an upright vacuum cleaner about every two/three years. Over the past 20 yrs- it seems we get pretty fair use from the Hoover. We've tried about 6 different brands ... However, my favorite vaccum cleaner is a 30 year old cannister Eureka on runners ... but no one uses that but myself. It isn't worth a flip for the carpet, but it will sure clean a lot of stuff you can't use a carpet vac on."
4,Hoover Vacuum,"The product is great! I can't understand why it isn't stocked by local stores - it has received a very favorable rating from Consumer Reports for consecutive evaluations, especially considering performance and price. It makes it an even more attractive purchase with Amazon's convenience of ordering from home,no searching for it in stores, gas savings, no tax, and no shipping. Thanks - a great buy!"
4,"Long on features, short on cord","This inexpensive vacuum is relatively lightweight, has useful tools, and does a good job in sucking up what's on carpets and bare floors. The cord, however, is too short, and results in having to plug into 3 or 4 locations just to clean my small ranch-style house. With my old Hoover I plugged it into 1 location. That's the only negative in this product."
5,Sticking with Hoover and this is a great one!,"Great vacuum so far... Mom owned a Hoover for 30 years, and this one also does a great job for the price, from now on we will stick with Hoover."
3,Belt problems,"I've had this Hoover Tempo for almost a year. I really like this vacuum, but like others have mentioned, the belt doesn't stay on for long. It's not terribly difficult to repair (remove 4 screws, reattach, reassemble), but I haven't had this type of problem with past vacuums. Beyond that, I've been very pleased with overall cleaning performance. It works well on carpets and rugs and is light enough to use easily on my stairs. Also, I'm very happy that I've returned to a bagged vacuum. The bagless vacuums that I had used prior to the Tempo were frustrating -- seemingly, less suction and always emptying the cup."
5,excellent vacuum!,I recently purchased this vacuum because the one I had was terrible and only 5 months old. This vacuum is light and picks up everything. I highly recommend this product.
3,I don't agree with other reviewers,"I don't think the Hoover tempo widepath is as great as other reviewers posted on your website. It didn't pick up string, cat hair, or lint as well as a Shark handheld vacuum that I have. I was disappointed with the suction adn how I had to pass over many specks of dirt several times before they were picked up (if they were at all)."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath Vacuum,"I have ordered 3 of these Hoover Tempo Widepath vacuums.They came immediately with no shipping charges. Was very satisfied with Amazon. The vacuum is good with excellent suction.However, it isn't that good bare floors. There is no brush on/off switch so the dirt scatters on bare floors. The brush does not stop when in upright position, but for the price and for regular wall to wall carpet, it is excellent. It is also difficult to use on throw rugs that are not very heavy as the suction is so strong that it pulls the rug up. The attachments work well with strong suction. It is lightweight and does not require a lot of expensive filters. It is loud, but not as loud as others I have had. It uses bags, which I prefer to bagless. I would recommend it if you are aware of the drawbacks. You really can't beat the price for a good vacuum.You can also check out ""Consumer Report"" (Oct. 2007)for a review of this vacuum. It was rated a ""Best Buy."""
5,light weight - easy to use - cleans corners too!,"I realized my back was hurting from using the old vacuum cleaner, so I bought this one because it was recommended by Consumer Reports Magazine as a good vacuum that is also light-weight. I love it. If you run it next to the wall, it sucks up everything along the edge. I never had an upright that cleaned corners well before. I'm very pleased with this vacuum cleaner, and the price can't be beat."
4,Hoover Tempo Wide Path,My sister got one and raved about it. I love it. For the ease of vacuuming.No push necessary. However the cord winds in a strange way and I wishthe hose was a little longer. Price was great.
5,Best Price For a Darn Good Vacuum!,"Costs a lot less than the other guys, and cleans better than most. Picks up dirt that our 1 year old $300 vacuum was not getting."
3,Hoover Vacuum,Vacuum came fast & in good condition but the vaccum itself seems a bittoy-like as the front panel is a light plastic.So far pick up on rug is ok but could be stronger.
3,"I got a lemon, but Amazon made up for it!","Let me first say that I wasn't necessarily even in the market for a vacuum, but my sister called and insisted that this is the best vacuum she's ever had and that she was amazed at its affordable price. I ordered one and I learned, sadly, that the rotating part on mine didn't work. The hose and attachments worked like a charm, just that one part was not operating properly. Amazon customer service has won me over with their prompt attention to this, however. They are shipping me a replacement, and I am so pleased. My sister and a few of her friends just rave about this particular vacuum, and I soon hope to be among their ranks."
3,a little disappointing but works well,"I was disappointed in that the plastic parts seem cheaply made. The front tab was broken and the hose is VERY short and is now bent. I didn't want to bother with the return, so a little duct tape holds it together and it works well."
5,Hoover widepath tempo vacuum,"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumI have only used this vacuum a few times but so far am really pleased with it. I even vacuumed up a rug leading outdoors with the flat hard pile for nap and it vacuumed it very well. I don't have much to compare it to because my old vacuum was a Eureka Whirlwind that I bought several years ago that had to be defective because it wouldn't even vacuum up a piece of lint off of the floor. So anything had to be a step up. If I think the vacuum warrants another review after I have used it some more, I will add more thoughts later."
5,I would have never even looked at this in the store but sure glad I bought it!,"This is the best vacuum I have ever owned. It's amazing and I never thought such an inexpensive vacuum would do a great job. Honestly, if I hadn't read reviews and looked at consumer reports on it, I would have never bought it from a store. You really can't judge a book by its cover! It's light and easy to carry up and down stairs, the cord length seems fine and I haven't had belts break yet. I love it and my advice is buy this super cheap vacuum and save your money."
4,Hoover Tempo Vac,"I purchased this vacuum for a temporary living situation because it was inexpensive and got pretty good reviews. My experience has been very positive, the unit is a little loud but it does a great job. I use it on carpet, bare floors, and furniture and it does better than a lot of more expensive vacuums I've had. I am very satisfied and would recommend the U5140 Tempo to others."
5,A Great Vacuum at a Great Price..Does the Job!,"The reviews I read on this vacuum is what promoted me to make the purchase...and I am glad I did. This vacuum has the suction power!!! I have very long hair so I needed a vacuum to keep up with my daily life, and it does the job well. The attachments work very well also and does not affect the ability of the vacuum to still pick up well. And the price! I live on a budget and this fit right into my plan. Make your purchase...you will be very pleased!!!"
4,Great buy for the money,"Reviewed on Consumer Reports as a recommended buy. I replaced an older Hoover Wind Tunnel that was 3x more expensive; the new Hoover is lighter and the suction is very strong. Works well on bare floors or rugs.I placed my order on Amazon on a Friday, it was delivered on Tuesday saving me the hassle of trying to buy it locally."
3,Dont be fooled by low price!! You have to buy extra expensive part!,"Dont be fooled by low price! I use flex hose for crevices on stairs and furniture. Since flex hose is too short, the unit tips over. Adding the long hard tube to the flex hose is very awkward. That means you have to buy the Extra Reach Hose which costs around $45 with s&h.What I find questionable is that most of the ext flex hoses for other Hoover models cost less then $25)...but those wont fit this model. Its as if Hoover purposely made this unit much less expensive, with the knowledge that its hose is too short to be useful and that customers would then have to buy the expensive extra hose!"
3,attechment work well but doesn't sweep carpet that well,The attachments work. It doesn't sweep carpets as well as I expected. In addition it is really heavy. I would not recommend this one.
5,Excellent vacuum for the money!!!!!!!!!!,"This Hoover, although a weird color of blue, is the best deal for the money that I have ever purchased in a vacuum! We had a $160 bagless vacuum from Costco before this one and we hated it! I couldn't stand the messiness of emptying the canister and cleaning the filter was a nightmare as well. I found this bagged vacuum online and decided to give it a try for $57. I was pleasantly surprised by the suction and light weight of the Hoover. My husband owns a carpet cleaning company and he loves this vacuum as well. He recommends it to all of his clients now. I couldn't be more excited about cleaning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Good, Solid and Dependable for the Price","I'm a custodian at a church, and I bought three of these vacuums to use there. For the price, they are great little machines. The only downsides are that they are very loud, more so than many other vacuums I've used, and the bags on them can fill up rather fast (or maybe it is just really dirty). They have good suction, and have been very dependable. They have a nice wide path, even though they are a bit heavy. I use them for several hours a week, and as long as I change the bags, and change the belts regularly I have never had a single problem with them. Great deal for the money."
4,good vacuum for the price,"I bought 2 of these at the same time, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. The suction is excellent, as are the attachments, although a longer hose would be great. It makes a LOT of noise!! Sounds like an airplane getting ready to take off."
5,Great Buy!,"My very expensive vacuum went up in smoke after several expensive repairs. I needed a good vacuum quick. This one had a good rating and Was VERY affordable. It was delivered almost overnight, was easy to assemble and works far better than my former more costly vacuum. I am delighted with my Hoover Tempo Widepath Vacuum."
4,Super Low-priced Unit,"For the money, this is a great vacuum cleaner. The assembly was easy, the bags are inexpensive and easy to change. The short cord, considered by some to be a design flaw, is actually a blessing. I hate tangling up in long appliance cords. The unit is not terribly loud, and it really cleans the carpet! I give this prduct an ""A""."
3,It sucks! (and that's a good thing),"I like the vacuum until I try to use the hose attachment. All of the sudden dirt/dust comes spewing back at me and makes a big mess. I haven't yet figured out how to use the hose attachment without making a bigger mess than what I'm trying to clean up. For floors, it's fine."
2,Hoover vac,"Worked well for first few months but after a year it wouldn't pick anything up. May be a mechanical problem, not sure. The motor works well after 4 yrs. The vacuum just fails to pick up loose debris and I often need to go over an area multiple times before it picks up."
5,Consumer Reports was right about this one!,"I have gone through a few vacuums. Then, I decided to see reviews from Consumer Reports. This was recommended for the price. But, irrespective of the price, this works great. Bought in 2009 and still humming clean."
5,Well worth the money.,"The suction power of this vacuum is terrific? Put an attachment on it and all of a sudden you are fighting for control of the suction. It is wonderfully light-weight, gets dirt close to the walls/furniture, and we like the heigh adjustment feature.That all being said...holy crap it is loud! The cord could be longer, more flexible, and positioned higher (don't like the cord positioned at the bottom section of the machine).For the price,however, this is a great vacuum. We hope it can go the distance (our last machine is 17 years old)."
1,The Worst!,We've had two (dummy me) and they break down constantly. Carpet level control broke. On/off switch broke. Parts fall off. Heavy! Cord's too short! Hose is too short! Clogs often and has to be taken apart! BEWARE!
2,"Meh, get something better","I bought this because it was rated well on amazon and consumer reports. Now that I have had it for a year I don't understand all the positive reviews. The tube crinkles up like others have reported, it has trouble picking up small pieces of paper on a hardwood floor, which indicates to me that it has weak suction. The front panel constantly falls off due to either poor design or poor QC, probably both. I think when it comes to vacuums you just have to bite the bullet and buy a decent one that will last. Just my two cents."
2,Not Durable,"I owned an earlier version of this vacuum cleaner that was good enough and durable enough for the money. So, when it gave up the ghost, I replaced it with what I assumed was the same model. As has been noted by other reviewers, this later version of the Widepath is indeed more cheaply made than its predecessor, and does not include the headlight that the earlier model had (but then, I never considered a headlight an absolute must for a vacuum cleaner). It worked very well for about a year. After that, it started to lose suction. Finally, I had the same experience mentioned by at least one other reviewer: the thing started smoking as I vacuumed, filling our three-bedroom apartment with a repulsive odor, requiring the opening of all the windows in our place to restore the air to breathable quality. I would only recommend this to someone who's planning on living in this country for about a year, and will no longer require a vacuum cleaner after that."
2,Sucks in two ways,"I have owned my Hoover Tempo over a year now.PROS:Powerful! - Small legos...watch out! This thing really sucks dirt and anything else. Works well on carpet.Cost - it was really cheap.CONS:Quality - the hose on mine is crushed similar to those posted by another reviewer. The hose still works, in it's current state...for now. The hose and associated onboard tools are crappy and do not stay put when not in use.No switch to turn off the brush - Here, I knew what I was getting into. However, it was not until I vacuumed our bare floor in my bare feet, I realized all the dirt being scattered as I my toes were being pelted with dirt. The spinning brush can also be an issue when using the tools on stairs.If you need a vacuum mainly for carpet and do not need the onboard tools, go for it. If you need a more versatile vac for both carpet and bare floors AND decent onboard tools, I recommend spending more and get the Eureka Boss Smart Vac."
4,Wonderful for the price!,"We selected this vacuum based on it's rating from consumer reports. (Highest) We were tired of buying the expensive bagless products for $200 to $400 then having them die 1 or 2 years later. This vacuum works GREAT. The only drawback is having to use bags. But at this price and quality, it's something we can live with."
4,GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK,FOR A $60.00 VAC ........YOU CAN'T BEAT IT UNLESS IT WAS LIGHTERI HAVE OWNED A ORECK XL21 A $700.00 VAC AND ORECK UPRIGHT VAC'S DON'T WORK WELL ON SHAG CARPETS & THEY KNOW IT AND DON'T CARE !!!!!!!!!!!ANY ONE KNOW A LAWYER TO GO AFTER ORECK WITH A CLASS ACTION SUITE
4,Pretty good vacuum,"Pros: Has great suction, easy to use. Cons: Awkward to wrap cord, tools fall off back of vacuum during use."
4,Great bargain...great sweeper,"Take away all the bells and whistles, give the basic sweeper what it needs to get the job done and you end up with this sweeper. Rated #5 best sweeper by Consumer Reports, it comes in at a price that is outstanding among the $200 and $300 vacuum cleaners. It isn't real quiet, it isn't laden with useless tools, it is simple and does a great job... it is light and easy to manipulate around, especially since I have arthritis and neuropathy. Can't beat the price, if I didn't already say that. I ordered it one day, regular shipping, got it the next day. Thanks, it came at a time when we had company coming, old vacuum broke, couldn't afford an expensive one, couldn't believe the quality bargain."
3,Buyer Beware--the Belt Breaks Often and Is Hard to Replace!,"The price seems to be right on this and it does pick up well, BUT our belt has broken twice in the first six months of owning it. Very frustrating! And the belt replacements are difficult to find."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be....,"I purchased this vacuum after reading reviews posted here. Most were positive (good buy for the $$). Two major flaws with this vacuum: 1) hose for attachments WAY too short. Can not vacuum more than 2 feet from vacuum without tipping it over. Very annoying. 2) the carpet height adjustment either does not work on my vacuum, or is of poor design. No real adjustment happening. I will give the vacuum kudos for having good suction...since that is what a vacuum should do - right?"
2,Buy belt in bulk?,"Belt broke after ONE week usage. Vacuum is powerful but if I have to replace belt every week, I mind as well buy the $200 windtunnel. What's worse is Hoover customer service. When you call them, they make you feel that it is your fault. Then tells you belts do break down over usage time. But after only ONE WEEK??? Finally, they told me it will take 4-6 weeks for the replacement belt to arrive. Zero star for customer service and the belt. 5 stars for the rest of the vacuum. Disappointing to find out Hoover, an long-time surviving American company, treats customers like that. How about use a better rubber material??? Good thing Hoover doesn't make condoms."
1,Piece of junk,"Purchased this vacuum and the belt broke on it's 3rd use. We have a small house, maybe 1000sq ft and we don't even vacuum the entire thing. This was really a let down."
4,Off to a good start,"This was very affordable and seems quite functional. I have only had it a couple weeks, but it is a major upgrade. Works well on carpet, rugs, and not bad on bare floors. It is light weight and easy to maneuver. It was also easy to assemble. I've only used it twice, but am happy so far."
3,cheaply built,"When new it looked embarrasingly cheap and after a year of use the flimsy cover failed to close, the handle broke and it was a mess of damaged plastic. built to flimsy to get a 4 rating. I really think this got so many good reviews when it was listed for a lot less and not at its current price any bagged vacuum is really just as good. I am a member of consumer reports and while it gets good suction I believe they fail to test longevity of vacuums and any vacuum can be optimised for working good at first just to fall apart later."
5,Great vacuum!,This is a really great vacuum at a good price. It is not too heavy and works really well on carpet and hardwood floors.
4,as good as described,"For the price, an excellent machine that takes on most carpet willingly, without fancy bells and whistles. Not as good on tile / bare flooring, but adequate. The bags do seem small, but I've only had it three weeks, and they are better than having to empty a plastic bin, far superior to the Eureka that blew up three belts in three uses and that went back to the big-box store. I'm well pleased (I have a thirty-year old canister Hoover that still gives good service), and when my colleague said she was needing to purchase another vac, she came over, took a test drive across our living room and down the corridor, and went home and ordered one for herself."
5,great little machine,"I've used my new Hoover a few times and have no complaints. It's great on dog hair. The self-propelling feature is nice. I almost have to hold it back. Would be nice if it had a retracting cord, but that's no big deal. It's an attractive color, and is compact enough to store just about anywhere. Seems like a very good product for cheap money."
5,Can't be beat,I never thought I'd leave a review for a vacuum but this one deserves it! It's such a low cost for such a good vacuum. You can't go wrong when you buy a product that's ranked this highly buy other consumers.
5,hoover tempo vacuum,I am really pleased with this vacuum. It may not be fancy or have lots of bells and whistles but it gets the job done well. The sucking power is amazing. I feel like my carpet is really clean and free from pet hair. All the attachments work well and get into all the nooks and crannies of a home. I am very happy with the vacuum and the price that I paid for it. I haven't had any problems with it and I don't have any complaints about it at this time. I recommend it highly.
5,Fabulous and wonderfully economical,"We had received a small ""apartment style"" bagless vacuum cleaner as a wedding present three years ago. We were fed up with the constantly clogging filters, and when the wheels broke, we needed to get a new vacuum. My wife didn't want to spend a lot of money, and I didn't want to deal with filters all the time, so we went for this one.It's powerful! It's cheap! Maintenance is easy. My wife vacuumed up a washcloth and broke the belt, and it took me about five minutes to replace. It gets the dust out of our throw rugs and off the floor. It's also relatively light for a full size vacuum.Drawbacks are that it's a bit noisy, a bit hard to maneuver in tighter spaces (but then one should probably be using the extension hose), and that the beater roller still spins while the hose is in use (hence the vacuumed-up washcloth!). It is ideal for our three bedroom apartment.A huge value for the money."
4,Great Vacuum!,"I was looking for a good vacuum to pick up pet hair at a local department store and a young man who was there to also purchase a vacuum convinced me not to buy the $600 machine but to look at the Hoover Tempo Widepath. Unfortunately the store didn't have the model so I went home, got on line, and found this model on Amazon just by typing in ""Best vacuum for pet hair"". Since the reviews were fantastic, I bought two vacuums, belts, and bags. One is for my son and future daughter in law. We were all totally impressed by the suction of this machine, and have filled up several bags already! The only reasons for giving a 4 star rating is that I thought it had a full bag indicator on it and it didn't, it is noisy, and the hose is very short. I would pick this vacuum over a $500-$600 model any day!!"
4,does the job,"I generally like Hoover vacuums. Back in the day they had metal hoses, and I think that there locking systems worked better then. At bottom what makes a good mid-priced vacuum is power, and the motor on this one is powerful enough for most household uses. Assembly is easy if you are used to assembling things. I think one of the nuts was missing (though I won't fault Hoover for this, because I may have misplaced it), but I had an extra lying around, so no worries."
2,"Seems Great, Band Broke on First Use","This seems like a great vacuum cleaner and a great price. It was doing a great job on our carpet, but three rooms into the very first use, the band broke. I was vacuuming a pretty thick area rug....but I couldn't believe the thing broke the first time I used it."
3,Great but...,"Def gets the job done. But I wish it wasn't so heavy, noisy, or didn't have small cord heard to reach far. and just found out that some features are lacking on the redesigned model. That def is a bummer big time. Still a great buy for what it's worth."
2,"not bad, but the belt istantly broke","its suction power is OK, a bit cheap'looking. Once received it, I was excited to try it. However, after operating for exactly 15 minutes something got caught inside, the belt was broken, it got hot and burning smell was everywhere. Returned it the next day. I got ""Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum"" instead, about 20$ more expensive but much nice and expensive looking, suction power is great, rewind wire, bagless, air-circulation mark... I love the bagless one. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF MONEY. Pay a bit more and get a better machine.Hoover 5507-900 Elite Auto-Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
2,Defective Product,"Though i gave it 2 stars, there should be an option for defective...After vacuuming, when turning the switch off, there is an electrical spark right under the switch cover which is not normal, and seems unsafe to me, given also that the spark is of different strength each time, though not in direct exposure to the electricity because of the switch cover. I am taking it to the local Hoover repair place to have it looked at and hopefully fixed.Other than that, The vacuuming seems powerful."
3,Great until the belt broke,"Bought this vacuum from Amazon for a WONDERFUL price just over 2 years ago after moving from an apartment to a town house. It was easy to assemble and worked great for 2 years until the belt that connects the beater bar (the bar that rotates with all the brushes on it) broke. After buying several of the belts recommended in the owners manual and having each and every one break after one or two uses ... and in one case after about 15 seconds ... this vac is headed for the trash.Would I buy another one of these? Yes, but I would be much more vigilant in making sure the beater bar and surrounding areas stay free of clogs or large clumps of hair. Also, it isn't like this was a $500 vacuum so I am not out a ton of money, and I certainly didn't expect it to last forever. It just would have been nice to see it keep going for more than two years."
4,Well worth the money!,"We bought this Hoover vacuum after reading rave reviews in Consumer Reports. It was to replace a $140 vacuum we bought only 6 month ago (Eureka brand) The little Hoover out vacuums by far, suction is excellent. The only drawback is a very short hose. After using both bagged and bagless types, we will stick with bagged as they don't clog and the suction is much better."
5,good product,"Overall it does its job quite well. Strong power, and clean air. No complain about its function. I did not like its looks though, especially the color. Anyway, can't ask for too much for such a nice price"
4,Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum,I chose the Hoover U5140-900 vacuum because it had an excellent rating inConsumer's Report. My ONLY complaint is that it is heavy. I would loveto have a light-weight upright that cleans as well as this one does. Itis self-propelled which helps a lot. The on-board hose is easy to use.
4,Great Purchase for the money,This vacccum is a great purchase for the money. It had all of the features that we were looking for and at a very low price. We've been using it for four months now and no complaints or issues.
4,Hoover U5140-900,"This is a basic vacuum cleaner that does a very good job on both carpet and tile. It is a bit noisy, but the price makes up for it."
1,cheap and nasty dud,"I bought mine at Sears several years ago on the strength of reviews at Amazon and in Consumer magazine. The latest issue (March 2012) continues to give it a rave, which reminds me that mine sits in a cupboard barely used. I got sick of squeezing out the kinks in the hose, it's heavy as hell (and I'm a strong 40-year-old dude), noisy (I need ear plugs), the bag monitor got stuck on full, it's unwieldy on stairs (as warned), and it never really sucked anything. I had to go over every patch of carpet several times, and we don't even have pets or messy kids. I would dump it, but I stupidly bought dozens of bags, so I need to buy a replacement on the basis of the bags it uses."
3,Great Vacuum but 2012 model has no light!,"I just bought another Hoover widepath tempo because it has worked so well for us over the last few years and is very well priced. It picks up cat hair and baby/toddler crumbs well. However, I am VERY disappointed that there is no longer a light on the vacuum (2012 models)...the light on our previous model worked very well and was very handy to have. Thus, I can only give it 3 stars this time around."
2,Not Good for Long Hair Dogs,"I bought this vacuum because of the price and good reviews. I haven't found one vacuum to be good, or at least manageable when picking up dog hair. I bought this vacuum 6 weeks ago. I have already had to take the vacuum apart twice. The dog hair gets clogged and I have to use a straightened clothes hanger to unblock it. This happened even though I pick up the chunks of dog hair with a broom before running the vacuum. It performs well on areas in which the dog doesn't frequent."
3,Hoover Tempo review,"If all you vacuum is carpet, this machine does a very good job, but I was used to using the tools on a regular basis. The hose is permanently attached, which is a very important thing, but the hose does not stretch, like my old vac did, making using tools very awkward. It's hard to even vac. the surface of the couch, or more than one stair. Also,my old vac had a handle on the back, so I could handle it while vacuuming up or down the stairs. This one claims to have a handle on the front. I am a woman. I can't imagine how tall you would have to be to use this feature. Also, the tools install inside the hose & they don't stay in very well. It also doesn't do well on non-carpeted floors. Plus, I wish all cleaning tools would have a very neutral color, like beige or grey so it would blend in if it doesn't get put away immediately. I expected a better product from Hoover."
4,A GOOD VAC,THE U5140-900 IS A GOOD VACCUM WITH GREAT SUCTION.THE SUCTION WILL GRAB ANY THROW RUGS.WHEN I USE THE ATTACHMENTS THE THE VACCUUM TENDS TO FALL OVER.YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!
5,Great bang for the buck!,This is an excellent vacuum. It does a great job on the dog hair. The hose length for attachments is a bit frustrating but overall a great purchase. The bags fill rather quickly and are a little pricey. Overall I would suggest this item. A great bang for the buck!
5,Superior Hoover,"I have a canister vacuum costing several hundred dollars. While it is good on bare floors and tile, it is not very good on carpet. The Hoover is a wonderful product for carpet and is very good even on bare floors. It has placement for all of the attachments, easy access to the bag, and a convenient carry handle if one needs to lift the vacuum, as I do. My daughter had gotten one of these to begin with, and when I saw how well hers worked with pet fur, etc. for an active household, I decided to get one. The price is excellent and is a very good value. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Basic Vacuum Cleaner,"This plain-looking, bagged vacuum cleaner does its job of sucking up dust and small particles well. It's not quiet but not noisier than other vacuum cleaners I've had. It's light and easy to pick up and move around. Mounted to the back are various hoses and brushes that are easy to pull off and use. I'm not very mechanical but it only took me about half an hour to assemble the vacuum cleaner out of the box at my leisure. A Y-type bag is included inside its body. So far, this vacuum cleaner is looking like a great value for its money (~$63). The only thing I don't like about it is the blue body is somewhat thin plastic. I would've preferred a tougher-feeling material."
4,Great book to help get you there!,"This is a great book to get you to your child's level and them to your level and how to meet in the middle. As a father that adopted my wives daughter I had a lot to learn. She hates authority, but after reading this book we have learned how to communicate better."
5,Good book!,It's a little old school but it reminds me of the basics to get your kids to listen! I suggest this book!
4,How to talk so kids will listen,"A very good book, but it seems to repeat a lot of the same advice. I have only finished 1/2 of the book, but so far I have gleaned some helpful advice"
5,Great book,Am half way through and it is already making a tremendous difference in our household with two little ones. Highly recommended for parents who want to raise their chldren consciously.
5,Love it,"Love the examples in the book. I love how it gives me things to try out on my kid, which have totally worked. I would recommend this book to any parent."
5,Works!,This system works. I came across their cassette tape series many years ago and used it while teaching Child Development. I used it on my own strong willed child as well.
2,Too much reading to find the advice.,"If you bought the book because you need to have your children understand you, you wouldnt have time to find your answers. This book wouldve been a lot easier to read if the authors didnt write their workday. All I needed was advice but this was more work than trying to talk to a toddler and who has time for all the reading if you have a toddler????"
1,Bunch of Rubbish,"I bought this book many years ago when our youngest who is now 19 was 3 or 4. It is the typical modern psycho-babble about trying to understand your kids etc. Useless trash. You are much better off going with John Rosemond's ""Six Point Plan to Raising Happy Healthy Children"". Much more effective tools and practical.We have 7 children and Rosemond's books were very helpful. If I would have tried to follow the advise in this book, I would have had a nervous breakdown by now."
2,too short! like cliff notes or a trailer to a movie - get the book instead!,"I got this CD thinking it would be an easy way for me to be productive on the subway to and from work. By the time I got home... I had listened to the whole CD!! That's it! I was very disappointed, because the content was great, and I wanted to hear more. I neglected to read that this was an ""abridged"" version of the book. Too bad, it felt like one chapter out of a book rather than the whole book. I got the book for my 3 pregnant girlfriends and they were all really excited to read it (as were some of their husbands). I own the authors' book about how to talk so kids listen and learn, and i think the principles taught are wonderful. I have yet to try them on my future students, but I have secretly tried their techniques on my husband and it seems to work with him :)."
3,Some useful information,This book doesn't tell us any more than what we already know. It reminds us all of what we sometimes tend to forget.
5,Talk & Listen book,"I really appreciate this book, it is teaching me how to communicate with my kids!!!!!! : )"
1,Not at all what I was looking for,"I didn't find it insightful or helpful at all. I have step kids and have MAJOR behavioral problems to deal with. So if you are getting this book for that purpose don't bother because this book is geared more for if kids don't clean their rooms or eat all of their vegetables type situations. I am an avid reader of psychology and negotiation. I found this books format similar to the emotional code, the way it gives examples and then an explanation of solutions and examples of the right way to deal with the problem. I think getting to yes, a negotiation book is much more helpful then this book."
3,"Good techniques, not just for reading","The book feels a little ""old"" although the methods recommended in it are timeless. It had a little too much of workshop over it where you should be working in a group with role-play etc. in order to follow the recommendations. Over all; good recommendations for how to talk to kids and you can skip the work-shop parts."
2,Not impressed by the philosophy.,"The writers claim that children will naturally come to the right conclusions about how they should behave if simply listened to, and allowed to feel whatever they are naturally feeling. This simply isn't true. Most children need more guidance. I agree it should be gently done, but I disagree that parents should never lecture or ""preach to"" their children. If you never tell them what is good, how can they choose to be good? Overall, the writers had good intentions, but their technique is a bit on the floofy-feely side. The result would surely be completly undisciplined children. A better book is ""1-2-3 Magic: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12"" by Thomas W. Phelan. It is still gentle, but firm. Kids aren't left to flounder about how they ought to behave to be happy."
5,How to talk so your kids will listen and listen so your kids will talk,"AWESOME, practical book. I'm a mom and special ed teacher and suggestions in this book are empathetic and consistent. BEST of all, this book is easy to read and FULL of common sense. You could pick it up and get started right away without overly academic dialog. I give this book an A++++!"
5,Attention Stepparents!!!!!!,"This should be required reading for anyone even dating someone with kids. As much as I would like to think that I am an intelligent, confident female, I was more than surprised to find out that this five year old could make me question what the heck I was doing and reduce me to tears. Here we are almost 6 years later and my now stepdaughter is a wonderful addition to my life!! For the record, so is her Dad!!! While rearranging some bookshelves, she found my very used copy of this book. She held it up and said 'now I know what helped you be such a great stepmom!' It is an easy and 'make sense' read. GET THIS BOOK!!"
5,Relationship Bible!,"I was quite skeptical at first but after reading the first two chapters and seeing the immediate positive reaction from my kids, i am hooked."
5,"So simple, yet spot on",I feel that this book contains ideas on communication that can be applied to almost any situation. It is a good lesson to understand your own feelings in order to properly communicate with your children so practice these skills frequently.
1,Ridiculous Book!,"This book was ridiculous in its suggestions for ""teaching"" children to deal with their feelings. Having them ""write down"" their feelings when they're writhing around on the floor? You must be kidding?! It was a big waste of money. Read John Redmond's books. Now THERE'S a guy that you can learn something from."
2,"How to talk so kids will listen, and listen so kids will talk...","Boring! I love to read about child behavior, and parenting. this book was not up my alley."
2,non sense,"like the ""teen"" one. i was pressure into buying this book, knowing it will not work, because every kid is different."
1,'Positive Parenting'- Doesn't work,"This book has the best of intentions but in real life doesn't work. Have you wondered why today's kids are running around out of control and poorly behaved? It's because of books like this, teaching parents new methods of parenting that don't work. Reasoning with a 5 year old....'tell me how you are feeling right now (after you have colored with marker on furniture).' No! How about a good old fashion spank and being sent to your room."
1,the worst book on the market,If there would be 0 stars I would give it to the book. It is probably the biggest waste of money - the moment I opened it I decided to send it right where it came from. I do not know who wrote those positive reviews but I think they are fake. I always read the reviews before I buy and this time it was shoking to me.
1,Somnambulistic Programming,I noticed at the very beginning of the book thesomnambulistic structure that could be harmful.Some of these sentence structures within the book\could be construed as somnambulistic messaging designed to project illness upon your children. (Read the laws of phychic phenomena! this book will explain a little about what I am saying. It was written by a doctor in the 1800's.also need to read Influence the psychology of persuasion.If you want more understanding about what I am talking about you need to study hypnosis and self hypnosis. The people that wrote this book should know better. They are educated professionals supposed to be helping people.
4,Useful communication tool,This book provides good examples to parents of how to communicate with your children or individuals working with children. I found the book to be more of a resource guide than just a book to read.
3,for younger children,"Dr. told me to read this, but my my kids are in there 30's and it did not really help my situtationA good book for use with younger kids."
5,"Incredible, easy to read, life altering parenting book!","I'm in a parenting book club reading this book right now. There are cartoons in the book that illustrate how to talk to and listen to your children in a way that has them empowered to do their own problem solving with you listening. In addition, children are left feeling loved, valued, and confident when parents use this type of communication. This book is fun and easy to read, and will make a lifelong difference! I highly recommend this book!"
3,how to listen,This book has helped me a bit but my children are older so a lot of it just doesn't apply.
5,Very Helpful,This book has been very helpful to me. I recommend this book to any parent with children of any ages. Great authors. Can't wait to read the others.
3,Good,For what I've read - so far it is things we already know and practice so I could not give 5 stars!
1,"Nice Idea, but badly presented","I bought this book because I agree with the thought that one should respect children's feelings. However, I found the book a boring read and its contents and examples very simplistic. I did not feel that this book offered any insights into a child rearing philosophy, but tried to act as some kind of manual on how to bring up children without any consideration to the fact that children are not all the same, and hence do not always react in such a predictable manner as assumed by the examples."
2,"Content is average, audiobook is HORRIBLE","I honestly think this is a ""vanity published"" book. The content is dated and simplistic, kinda Dr. Laura style. I have the CD, read by the authors. Good God, that was a mistake. I guess I'd have rather have had a professional reader without driveling nasal voices. Anyway, READ the book, but DO NOT under any circumstance, BUY THE CD. It SUCKS!"
5,Must read parenting book!,This book is a MUST READ for every parent. I have read it almost once a year since I found out I was pregnant with my first child may years ago yet every time I read it I am able to apply something new to the way I interact with the children.
4,very good information,This audio tape made me realize why I wasn't getting anywhere with my lengthy lectures as to why we don't do this or that. So far this has proved to work. I will recommend to others.
4,Fast delivery,"Was recommonded by my sister who studied nursery in college, so far reading it and found that the book is more cater for kids who are 3+ years old. My son is only 2.5 years old and he still doesn't ask me all these questions yet.But i am sure this book will come in handy once he starts questioning my authority and other things."
5,Excellent book!,This is a must read for every parent and teacher! I love the cartoon examples. They make the concept so much easier to grasp. I wish all people talked to each other in this way. The world would be so much nicer.
4,very pleased,I am very pleased with the fast shipping and good condition of this book. Just as described which was a great surprise considering the price was so low I almost expected to recieve a book in worse condition than described. Haven't finished reading yet but so far the information is invaluable and applicable for any age or situation.
5,How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk,Great insights and practical advice. Wish I would have had this available when my children were young.
5,Essential for every parent!!,I borrowed this book from the library and I absolutely love it. I will be buying myself a copy right away.All parents owe it to themselves and their children to read this book. It's just about guaranteed to sort out most of your parent/child problems.I used it's guidelines just this morning to finally end a very frustrating recurring problem with my 5 year old.I cannot recommend it enough!
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is an invaluable resource and every parent should read it. We all say that a child should come with an instruction manual - well, this book is just that! I would highly recommend the active listening and talking techniques to anyone with children. The skills that are taught can transform a bad behaviored, ill-tempered child into a good kid with little effort. Wonderful Book!"
5,Realistic and human,"This book recognizes that as parents we are not perfect, but want the best for our children. The simple truth that acknowledging children's emotions and honoring their right to have them is a breakthrough for most of us, says volumes about how we were raised. Learning the skills in this book and a change of viewpoint on our part can bring us closer to being the parents we want to be."
4,Good book,"I have older boys ages 11 and 13. I liked the book, but felt it was geared a bit more to younger kids. Very simple approaches to issues with kids that were easy to try on the kids with good results."
5,the best one yet,What a truly wonderful book. It's an oldy but a goody. This bood kept me interested to the point that when I did get the chance to sit and read I didn't want to stop. These authors are very much in tune with the way children work (how they tick). I love the way that they used little cartunes to get a point accross.A must for every parent and/or teacher. Your children will thank you.
5,A must have book for basic communication for everyone,"I have owned this book for several years and have given it as a gift a number of times. It is not a cure all, but it does offer many useful strategies in communicating with your children. For that matter, my (childless) cousin bought it because she heard that it had good strategies for communicating in the work place. That said, it is not always easy to implement. Sometimes bad habits are hard to break, and it helps to have the book on hand for continual reference. I have found myself reading sections over throughout the past few years, as my children get older and I am faced with new challenges.It is, essentially, a reference book that I think every parent should have. Most of the strategies are just practical knowledge that you don't really think about until you see them in black and white. While it does not have all the answers, in combination with other parenting books, it should be on every bookshelf in my opinion."
3,Interesting Christmas Cartoons,"Ok cartoons but pretty boring, in different languages, etc... Russian cartoons, pretty hard to follow, but some of the selections are prettty good."
3,Okay,"The only reason I bought it was to get ""Christmas comes but once a year"". That short video was great. I didn't enjoy the other cartoons. I was hoping it was the same video I had several years ago on VHS, but it wasn't. Overall, just okay."
4,The Bishop and the Missing L Train: read it or you will be left standing on the platform,"The characters are interesting. Enough description is given so that you feel like you know them and the locations without creating a drag on the plot. The mystery itself is complex but not so intricate that you feel like you cannot solve it, and while red herrings abound, all the clues are there. While the protagonist is a little stingy with his thoughts on the case in the early stages, he eventually reveals enough to make you feel like you are on the case as well."
4,Predictable,"A predictable, if original Father Blackie book. Although this story strays from the traditional ""locked room"" types of cases that Blackie is famous for, it is very similar in that one knows that an ""L"" train cannot simply disappear. The secret of its disappearance and the perpetrator of the evil deed in kidnapping the disliked auxillary bishop were transparent from an early point. Not one of Greeley's better efforts."
5,parent and kid friendly,"This is my daughter's new favorite cd, and it's my favorite of all her cds. She plays it non-stop, and I don't even mind. I'd definitely recommend it to any kid and any parent."
2,Disappointing follow-up to the wonderful series debut,"I loved THE PRIMROSE CONVENTION, the first book in the series, but was disappointed by SWITCHBACK. CONVENTION featured a wonderful ensemble of distinctive, endearing characters, teaming up to locate a missing man. The relationships among these characters were charming and unique. In SWITCHBACK, the main characters are fairly isolated from each-other for most of the book. The story centers around one of them, who is subjected to enormous suffering, partially caused (unintentionally) by another of the formerly-likeable characters. The unremittingly bleak tone is a misstep in my opinion; it didn't work for me. And the qualities that made CONVENTION special are mostly absent from SWITCHBACK. I don't object to a somber book, but this one felt ""off."" CONVENTION wasn't sappy-sweet, but it did strike a hopeful tone, and SWITCHBACK's tone was... hopeless."
5,Don't Miss This Album,"Despite what you may think, Gabriel Gordon isn't completely unknown. He toured with Natalie Merchant on her 1998 Ophelia tour and 2000 folk tour. I have enjoyed his work with Natalie and this album is a shining example of his talent. I only hope that he continues to work with Natalie."
3,Gabriel Gordon will move you,Frequency is full of good vibes! There's not a song you won't like . . . it's an excellent album from an exceptionally talented artist who surely has more to share.
5,Wow! A great read!,"I had never really known much about Lytton Strachey before reading Taddeo's book. I ordered this on a whim and loved it---I've just ordered Strachey's Eminent Victorians after reading this.Taddeo writes really well---the book moves quickly and I was fascinated by Taddeo's analysis and discussion of Strachey's sexuality. What I liked most about this book (and I can't say this enough!) was its readability. This is a book for scholars and non-specialists.If you've read any of the books by the Bloomsbury group or if you love the Victorians, buy this book (actually you should buy it and read it no matter what!)."
3,Good but disappointedly slim volume,"The contributors are all very distinguished, but their contributions in this case are very short (3-5 pages) and short on originality. Disappointing."
2,Great song but HORRIBLE REMIXES,"I love Tracy Thorn and the original song is great, but the remixes are HORRIBLE. This song in the hands of a couple of great djs would have been fantastic. Don't waste your money on this and buy the album."
2,ahmed from dubai,excellent for filtration but the packing was very bad and it was smashed by the other items shipped with and i rate them for 2 stars
1,ineffective,"I have planar faciitis and my doctor gave me a boot for night wearing. The boot my doctor provided is rather large but really does help. I purchased this soft boot because I figured it was smaller and easier to pack when I am traveling for work. Sadly it is not effective at all. Without a stiff bottom or back, it is easy to point my toe which it is supposed to prevent. I do NOT recommend it even for traveling."
2,With interersting ideas but lack of depth,I read the amazon reader reviews before I bought the book. Yet I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the purchase. The principles in the book about dream making is nothing new at all. The book tries to relate a concept of 'ease' with a life working towards your dream. But it is not very convincing to me. And the 5-step process on finding your dream is a typical method that can be found in many other self-help books.
4,"An old concept, handled particularly well","Anyone who's a product of western culture will have encountered the protagonist who doesn't know what he's doing, where he's going, and generally loses faith in everything. Hell, anyone who's a product of western culture will have encountered actual people like that. That's why I can't give this book five stars...people, like the protagonist, with ""western disease"" as I call it, don't get any sympathy from me. What on earth is so special about being young and disillusioned? Despite the (to me) intrinsically flawed premise, Erlend Loe makes me laugh, a lot. What's more the language used was simple enough to allow me to get the whole point of almost every situation, despite being in Swedish. I can't say this is a particularly special or noteworthy book, but it is definitely worth a read. And if you're a beginning reader in a new language, it's definitely worth it due to the easily understandable and spare style of the writer."
3,Not Even a Trailer,"This film kind of disappointed me. I was expecting a full-blooded adventure story involving killer ants instead the first two-thirds of the film involve the tensions between a South American plantation owner(Charlton Heston) and his mail-order bride(Eleanor Parker). This is kind of a one-sided battle in my mind because young Heston's performance here borders on the stiff whereas Parker, a more seasoned pro at this juncture of her career, gives a full-bodied performance. And she looks lovely in her Edith Head creations. The film does kick it into the next gear once the soldier ants arrive to save the day.The Technicolor jungle photography is great to look at. Lastly, William Conrad a.k.a TV's ""Cannon"" does a colorful turn as a local magistrate."
3,Worth watching for the ants,"This is an adaptation of the fabulous short story ""Leiningen Versus the Ants."" It was acceptable, but could have been amazing, if Charlton Heston's character in the movie hadn't been such a turn-off. I love Heston as an actor, but by the half-way point I really wanted his character to get eaten."
5,Love this movie,Charleton Heston was marvelous in everything he was in. My boys (16 and 11) love this movie! Wonderful!!!
4,The Naked Jungle (aka Lanigen's Ants),"Charleton Heston and Eleanor Parker star in this movie about love and army ants. I believe it was originally released as ""Lanigen's Ants"". Heston plays a wealthy land owner with very definite ideas of love and marriage. Eleanor Parker is his mail order bride who enlightens him to what love and marriage should really be. The army ants are there to wreak havoc with his hard earned dynasty and to threaten their blossoming relationship. As a Charleton Heston fan, I really enjoyed this movie."
3,A period piece in more ways than one,"A beautifully filmed and at times exciting work, this movie is also an unfortunate reflection of the era in which it was made. America in 1954 was a much more confident, arrogant society than the one we know today, and is well depicted by Charlton Heston's Noble-White-Man-Civilizing-the-Savages type of hero. Many of his lines are unintentionally hilarious when delivered before a modern audience, as is his Super-Macho-Man wooing of the always beautiful Eleanor Parker. A decent adventure/romance but not a classic in any sense. In a word: dated."
4,Remember when,"If you remember when movie stars were actually people with talent, people who could actually act, people who could make a movie with romance and adventure without blatant sex, drugs, and excessive violence... then this is one for you. I remember seeing it many years ago and as a fan of Charlton Heston could not wait to see it again. Truly a movie classic of an era when men were men and women were women and you could tell the difference. More often than not these day, oldies are truly the best."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"This is a great action/romance flick featuring Charlton Heston as the owner of a cocoa bean plantation in the South American jungle. The film consists of a two part plot involving 1)the arrival of a beautiful bride played by Eleanor Parker and her developing relationship with Heston, and 2)the more ominous impending arrival of a relentless swath of ants eating everything and everyone in its path. I remember seeing this movie on television as a kid and loving it. Having just watched it again I can say I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Sure, the special effects are not 21st century but let's remember the movie was made in 1954. The worthy script and acting make up for this."
5,Great Classic Film,"Naked Jungle (1954) [VHS] What a great classic film. Charleton Heston and Eleanor Parker are electrifying together. Definitely a ""keeper""."
2,Not Great,"I was fairly disapointed with this book. I suppose the information was both pleantiful and clear, but the presentation was extreamly boring. This is definitely a reference book more than it is a ""coffee table"" or casual enthusiast's book. The entire book is printed on high quality, heavy paper in black & white. An approx. 20 page full color spread is included in the center of the book"
5,good review,Land Rover the unbeatable 4by 4 is the best book on Land Rovers money can by. It is packed with usefull information about Land Rovers and no other book comes close. It is very comprehensive in terms of looking at the history of Land Rovers. Yes the pictures are in black and white but it is a good book to say the least. There are other books that have color pictures but do not share such excellent insight into the facinating world of Land Rovers. I have never found a book that is better than it.Perfect for a Land Rover enthusiast.
4,well done,"The rhyming is well done (not forced like some books), the story well told and realistic. My 4-year-old daughters who have a 2 year-old brother think it is great and ask me to reread it. It is not overly sacharine or preachy."
5,ROADTRIP NATION,"This book is a great guide for a person of any age. It shows the routes various people have taken in their careers to get to where they are while at the same time encouraging its readers to map out their own paths. It's a great gift idea for graduates or anyone who could use some insight. I highly recommend this book because it is quick to read, has great stories and hilarious anecdotes. Plus, I really loved the big green motor home."
3,Very pleased,I had to buy the book Roadtrip nation for a class I was taking at a community college. It turned out to be a really great book about different career choices. My book also came in great shape.
5,One of the true classics of Rock and Roll,This is a must have for any fan of this band. After the bitter fight with whats his name. The boys did theselves justice with this great CD ( Album )back in my time. Makes you wonder what would have happened if Peter Frampton had joined up as originally planned. Rock and Roll at its finest.
4,Wake up and live!,"For a self-confessed classic Brit rock fan, this is a bit of a novelty to enthuse over such an 'American' band, but in the 70s these guys were a bit special, and the appeal in those years between playing the vinyl regularly and getting hold of the CD many years later, has not waned at all. The sound is brimming with lust for life and 'get out there and enjoy', in a way that the Brits just don't 'do'!"
2,"difficult read, author presumes you know Oberon","Dry, uninteresting introduction to compiler design. Written like a reference rather than a text, the book is about as exciting as watching grass grow. Do not try reading this without at least 8 hours of prior sleep. The author should collaberate with an American writer and make it easier to read. The author makes it a point to showcase all of his publications and work. He also assumes the reader has some inate knowledge of Oberon, Modula and Pascal - all very esoteric languages and of questionable relevance."
2,Too little has changed in twenty (or thirty) years.,"I took a graduate course that included building a table driver, recursive decent (parsing) compiler-compiler, very similar to the one covered here, in 1967-68 using a book by Peter Z Ingermann. This book isn't mentioned in the Bibl. but 4 of the author's previous works are... nuff said!"
4,"An excellent book to grasp the essence of OO, JAVA and UML","I have gone through your book entitled ""The essence ofobject-oriented programming with java and UML"" and Imust say that you wrote a very fine book.To explain my point and let you know what is goodabout it from my own perspective, I find it not quiteadvanced in its treatment of the JAVA language but atthe same time it gives you a sense of knowing rightfrom the beginning the very essence of the language.In addition, introducing in parallel the UMLmethodology helps a lot to understand the software""production"" requirements.I have gone through several books for the last 5months. Each pretending to explain once and for allJAVA or UML. But your book is the only one I found socomplete in its treatment of both OO, JAVA and UML(even though it is only 290 pages long !).Again, thanks for such a fine book and my best wishesfor all your future endeavors."
2,Terrible audio,The video was great but the audio portion was terrible. Sounded like the battery was running low while filming and recording the music.
1,Cheap price cheap product,"I received bulb and installed it and it's not brite at all I have a total of 3 1000watt reflectors , and 2 lights are the same briteness and the new one is way dimmer, not worth sending back I'm just going to my local grow shop and purchase new bulb I can't afford to run a dim light bulb plants like alot of light that why I have 1000 watt set up not a 400watt"
3,Good results for a decent price,"This lamp lived up to my expectations. It was a cheap lamp that did well overall. Nothing spectacular, but then it was a cheap lamp. :DI would not hesitate to grab one of these again in the future."
3,Midnight club,I could not play the game due to it being a online game only and I never hooked my ps2 up into the online feature.
1,Wouldn't play!,"Ordered this for my son, and when we recieved it, it would not play in his system, even though i ordered it new, not used."
1,midnight club 3,This game was terrible!!! It was so scratched up it would not even read in my play station. Do not buy this it is terrible and i emphasize TERRIBLE!!!!
3,this game is OK,ok this game is pretty much the same as the first but they added 24 new vehicles and a couple of new songs and they've added tokyo as a new city.if you dont already own the first then i would buy this one or if you have the first version and it screwed up and you wonna play it or somethin then yeah.but its almost the same exact thing so whatever its a good game.
4,Customization!,"If, like me, you find customization of your cars oneof the best parts of racing games ...This is the game for you.A ton, a TON, of options in the body shop.And great racing fun as well.Superb graphics. Great courses. Great cars.Recommended."
2,poor condition,the cd is in very bad condition looks as if somebody took a key to it played 5 min started a file bought a car will not load the world map game cant b played
1,The game had design probs i know.. but this is scratched.,this has a lot of deep scratches and wont read hardly. it freezes at the start screen and takes forever to load anything
2,It's OK in some reasons,"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix has some pros, and some cons:PROS:-This game has over 90 listenced vheicles that range from classics, luxury sedans, tuners, exotics, and trucks/SUV's-You have 4 cities which include San Diego, Atlanta, Detroit, and the new one, Tokyo-You have more music to listen to like rock, techno, hip hop, and dancehallCONS:-Tokyo (the new city) is hard to get around-The events in this game are hard to complete-Some of the cars in this game aren't worth using-Customizing your car is expensiveOverall, this game isn't good. But a game that I would recommend is L.A. Rush. It has more fun features than this game."
1,The origional edition is better!,"The remix edition is not my favorite!The features in this game are not fun to use!Some of the cars in this game are a waste to use!You can only have 30 cars in a garage, when there's over 90 cars to buy!Customizing your car is expensive! Plus there's not a lot of features to choose from!I think you're better off with the regular edition, or L.A. Rush!"
2,Nothing really changed!,"Well, I'm thinking about sticking with the regular version of Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition because the only thing that has changed in this remix is only a few more cars and one more city that I don't like.People should just buy the regular Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition so they won't regret later!"
1,bad,Came in a yellow pouch with scratches all on it never would order this again the disk stopped working after 1 use!!!
4,new city really isn't new,"Tokyo really isn't a new city, its new to this game but its not new to the game series. FYI Tokyo was already used in Midnight Club 2. If they really needed another city for this game they should have picked a different one like: San Francisco, or Seattle, or Boston, or Wash. D.C. ect. Instead of using one that's already been used. That's the only reason I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5. The games still awsome."
1,bad disc,I brought this disc and this game NEVER WORK.LIKE WHO WOULD WANT TO GET A GAME THAT DOESN'T WORK!I DID NOT BUY THIS USED IT WAS BRAND NEW I CAN UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS USED BUT IT WASN'T. SO BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The Best Racing Game Ever !,"The original version was an awesome game, but this one takes the cake. The few upgrades that are in this version make it well worth 20 bucks. There is more than 20 new cars, a new city, and more songs added to the radio. Even if you already own the original version this is still a must buy and if you dont have the original and you are a fan of driving games then this is STILL a must buy. The best thing about this new version is that you dont have to restart your old saved game file. If I could rate this game 1 to 5 I would give it a 20. This game is hours of fun for any racing game fan. Sure this game isnt very realistic, but that element makes it more fun. For anyone that owns a PS2 this is a must have game."
4,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!... sometimes,"i got this game used for 15 bucks. i played it and got addicted. after a week i was noticing sameness in the races. the cars on the road are always in the way, almost to a point where it is unrealistic.Pros:great customizationgradually gets harderworth the priceOK grapicsCons:Mechanics are idiots. they say stuff like, ""YOU DRIFT LIKE A GIRL!!!""TOO MUCH TRAFFIC!!easy to crash. way to much debristhis game is better than nfs. customization is so much easier and race rewards are so much better.overall, get this game if you like racing or customizing cars.P.S. This game gets VERY FRUSTERATING!so just do restart race."
5,the best overall,ok my brother brought me this game and I love it to death I love the sports bikes and chopers. they are about 100 cars in the game. now the muisc was the best I love the soul vibrates. the races are easy. when you play the game it breathes I mean the city cars try to dodge its so cool I Would never sell this game
5,Racing Fun,Very fun game with too many options and features to list here. This and Grand Turismo 3 are my favorite racing games of all time. It does not get any better.
4,Great game,"This game is a really great game, I would reccomend it to anyone who like racing games.I don't really see any flaws in this game, the only reason I give it a four is its graphics andlittle pet peeves.Another good part is that its cheap, and still a fun game."
2,soles disintegrate,"I bought these shoes in May 2011. By the middle of June, the soles and heels started to disintegrate. I had the same problem with a pair of Ecco shoes I bought about 8 years ago; the company acknowledged that there was a problem with the rubber compound and said they had corrected the problem. I suspect that the ""New City"" shoes are new old stock since they are not in the Ecco catalog, and the sole looks the same as the one on the earlier pair that disintegrated."
1,Needs Fixing,"For any teacher or Professor that is thinking of using this book as a basis for an essay. Do not use it. If it is the topic you want, then I encourage you to find another source. Although this book may be of interest to you, for any student reading this book it seemes like long, repeated facts. Especially if the students are not interrested in the topic. Prof. Hoffer presents a good argument, but it seems like a constant flashback of events. The time line is all over the place and it is very hard to read and follow along. If you still want to use it, I encourage you to assign chapters then discuss them for a brief period of time in the class room, this will give some students the ability to reflect upon the facts and ideas presented in the book."
1,Bye Bye epson,"Worked great for a little over a yearof normal use then started printing poorly, skipping lines, colors or completely blank pages. Never used anything but genuine epson ink. Cleaning the heads uses a lot of ink. To manually clean/wipe the heads or replace the discharge tube, which did come off, the machine has to be disassembled, a real pain. I also didn't like the way the cartridges electronically indicated as empty when they were obviously not. First and last Epson."
2,"Yeah, mine broke too","Worked well till a little past warranty, then the clogged head thing. One color then the other stopped working. Expensive ink cartridges left, now unusable."
1,Epson should not be allowed to conduct business this way,"My Epson printer died a month ago, even though I have always used Epson ink etc. It is apparently an unfixable problem, and I can only dump the printer. I cannot believe they keep on producing junks like this and take no responsibility for it. I am never going to buy an Epson again, and I hope other people will learn to do the same."
2,Problems with clogs,"I have to agree with the many people who have complained about the head clog problems. This printer worked great for a couple months and we really liked it. Then the ink heads started getting clogged. We have spent more money on ink trying to fix the problem than the printer originally cost. We never have been able to get the yellow to work again. It's been out for months. The black has a lot of problems off and on. It currently is not working. It seems that putting in a new ink cartridge helps it work for a short while--but this is, of course, expensive. I guess we're going to have to eat it and buy another printer after owning this one for only 8 months. Live and learn. I like the suggestion of a previous reader to buy the HP 2175 (or something similar) that has new cartridge heads with each ink cartridge. Then this problem would be avoided."
2,Some-in-One,"The unit functions very well as a printer and copier but I've been unable to get it to perform as a scanner/fax for my straight-stick Dell machine operating WindowsXP. Repeated consultations with Epson customer service have not resolved the problem, which is evidently resident in their software package. Getting Epson to respond intelligently and consistently was almost impossible. Nearly all commands to the printer now have to be entered manually: the smart-scan and control panel functions simply won't launch. You'll also find you go through ink cartridges quite quickly; they are remarkably expensive but readily available on-line or at office supply stores. Too much money for what amounts to an average color printer. I plan to purchase a machine from a different manufacturer when this round of ink is exhausted."
5,What an awesome buy!!!,"I was pulled between a Canon printer and this Epson CX5400. I am so glad to have gone with the Epson. I have not own an Epson for over 15 years. I have had Lexmarks, Canons and HP printers in the meantime. Not very happy with any of them. So far I am truly impressed with this product. Installation was a breeze. Documentation is great! Speed and print quality is good. I have yet to try printing photographs however. But the scanner, copier and basic printer are wonderful. With the rebate this was an incredible buy. Give Epson a try you will not be disappointed."
2,"Good printer, but for only a few months.....","I have had this printer for almost two years and started noticing banding when printing. I knew ink was low so I paid $80 for new ink and installed it. Now the printer won't print anything but blank pages. After a hassle with customer service (which by the way, spoke broken English; can't stand that), I gave up and returned the ink to Target and bought a new HP printer. That is when I noticed the other reviews had similar problems printing blank pages. And who wants to spend $80 on ink? You can buy new printers for that much. Plus this printer is huge and bulky. Not a good printer."
1,Giant Paper Weight,"I have encountered the blank page problems, which are annoying but fixable. The thing that sent me over the edge was the fact that the paper feed stopped working. Understand, this printer has had extremely light use, so there's no good reason for a hardware failure at this early stage of ownership. I wish I'd read these reviews before I bought it, but now I know. Epson, say goodbye to another customer."
2,Epson Schmepson,"Reading over other reviews I have the same insight. Fine for a year - beautiful, stunning prints - then one day, I installed a new ink cartridge, did the diagnostics and nothing but crappy, streaky prints. Bought all new ink cartridges (very expensive!) and of course, I am getting the same streaky, crappy prints.If you are looking for something for the long haul don't - I repeat don't invest in the Epson 5400. Save your money!"
1,Disposable printer - last time I buy from Epson,"Like many other people posting their reviews here, I have the same experience with the printer clogging up and not printing. This is a disposable printer and it really tarnishes Epson's reputation to put out such a POS. I won't trust their design and QA enough to buy any more products from them."
1,Printer head clogged!,"Just add me to the growing list of disatisfied owners. For the last year the printer worked fine, even after I changed the ink cartridges. Now the printer produces streaked pages but mostly nothing at all. Another problem is that the printer will not work unless all of the cartridges have an ink supply. What if I just want to print in black & white? Why can't this printer function without the color ink? $$$$$$ They want you to buy the overpriced cartridges, and they dry out if not used.All I can say is READ THESE REVIEWS before purchasing a new printer."
1,What a pain in the neck,"I was very happy when I first bought it. It exceeded all my expectations for a unit like this one but troubles started after one year. When the ink ran out, I promptly replaced the cartridges and I started seeing almost blank pages as the output. I cleaned the head several times, followed all tips/techniques on the net but nothing could solve the problem. Now I have to throw the unit and get a new one.I do not recommend this printer at all.Anyone who wants to strongly recommend this printer, please do so after using it for some time. As I said before, it works great until you replace the cartridges."
2,This one died too,"This was a great printer for 16 months. I used it every day, then it just started printing images that were faded. Tried new ink just a waste of time. Emailing Epson was a bigger waste of time."
1,this is the worst printer on the planet,"after about 1 year this printer completely stopped printing. brand new cartridges, head cleaning, nozzle checks...all to no avail. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"
1,Head Clog Blues,I add my voice to the chorus of woes. This is my second Epson printer to die in 3 years due to fatal head clogs. I only had the CX-5400 for a little over a year and suddenly it won't print from the yellow head. No amount of cleaning or patience would rescue it. I don't think this technology is ready for primetime.
2,Black and yellow stopped printing,I've had a CX5200 for about a year and a half. It worked fine until recently when I changed the black and yellow cartridges. The printer no longer prints black and yellow inspite of repeated head cleanings. I have changed cartridges previously with no problem.
1,Printing blanks,This printer worked great for a little over two years and died - it prints blanks now after I purchased and installed a new full set of ink cartridges. Epson probably (better) knows about this problem since so many online forums describe the same issue - let me see what I get as a replacement or repair when I call in. It seems like a giant time sink trying to repair this myself.The scanner still works great though.I have an equivalent HP for one year now (came almost for free with another computer purchase) and it works really well. Will have to wait and see how long it lasts.Hate to see so many perfectly capable machines find a land fill all because of clogged ink!
1,It's worthless,"Shame on Epson. This POS won't last longer than a single ink cart. It just stops working. Of course, it seems they don't even sale this anymore. Too bad for me."
1,"Me too, the Epson CX5400 breaks when changing ink","I thought I had done my research when choosing a printer but it no longer works on the first change of ink cartridges and I find that everybody else has the same problem.Epson might have had my money this time but I am never buying their products again.It appears to be a design fault in that the tube gets detached when you change a cartridge. Apparently it's possible but fiddly to reconnect. If I find my receipt, I am sending it back.Not happy woth Epson at all."
1,stopped after 6 months,Worked great for 6 months. Now it doesn't. I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying. :(
1,Cruel Joke of a Machine,"I've nothing to add beyond all of the other one-star reviews. It seems I've suffered the same disconnected tube fate that they have. All you 4 and 5 star reviewers will be there too, just wait.The only reason I'm adding a review is in the hopes that it will drive the overall rating of this product down even further."
2,Have to have color ink to print black and white files?!,"I was trying to print a black and white document, but an error message kept popping up -- out of yellow ink. the black ink was full, and that document has nothing to do with yellow color. but it wont let me print unless i replace the yellow ink cartridge. (i picked the ""black ink only"" option too.)it makes you purchase color ink even though you're printing black and white."
2,Very Disappointed,"After reading the mostly favorable reviews of the Epson Stylus CX5400, It seemed like a slam-dunk purchase. The setup wasn't difficult and the CD walked you through installation. There is a printed manual for scanning and copying; the manual for printing is on the CD which is not noted anywhere. Took a few minutes for me to locate it on my desktop. In comparison to my HP Photosmart P1100 - for which I cannot find a repair service - the Epson CX5400 was slow. Printing in draft mode, which I usually use, was extremely light and difficult to read. Normal mode printing was slow and the print irregular and uneven. There was no need to go beyond that, I packed it up and arranged to return it to Amazon. I gave it two stars because I am basically a charitable person. Setup was fairly easy and it did print, however poorly."
3,Mine is clogged at 2 year mark,"This printer worked fine for 2 years. 3 of the 4 ink cartridges need changing, so I did, and now nothing comes out at all.Epson only says I can take/send it 60 miles away to be fixed at unknow cost or offer me a discount on a new one.No thanks! This 5400 was a replacement for a 5200 that had the same problem. I'm going back to HP."
2,Great until the ink ran out,"Had no problems with the CX5400 until the ink ran out after a half year of use. I decided to try a generic brand ink from a high volume ink outfit. Maybe that wasn't such a good idea! That's the end of my printer. Tried an Epson brand black ink tank after the bad experience with a generic (nothing... no printing at all... the generic at least showed something). I admit that I could have damaged my printer with generic ink, but look at all the reviews from people who used Epson brand ink and still had problems. I used generics on my old Canon printer with no problem.Regardless, whenever YOU have a problem with your print head Epson has made sure you either pay hefty service fees for a fix or trash the thing. I'm now going to purchase a printer where the print head can easily be replaced by ME if it goes bad."
2,Don't waste your money,"I'm having the same problem with my CX5400 that many of the other reviewers are having. After replacing all of the original cartridges, only black and magenta work. Cyan and yellow no longer print. I just bought another cyan cartridge, but that didn't fix it. I'm not even going to bother talking to Epson b/c I don't want the hassle. I'll just replace it with a Canon or HP instead.My other beef is the scanning software, which is confusing and frustrating to use. Each time I scan something I have to re-learn how to use it."
1,Worthless Piece of Junk,"Based on the reviews, I bought an Epson CX5400 in the spring of 2004. UP until 3 months ago I would have given it a 5 star rating. I experienced the same problem as many others. First the printer would print only 2 out of 3 lines and now it prints nothing. Since at home repairs costs about $75-100 per hour I have a $200 piece of junk. Never will buy an Epson again."
1,Nice Features BUT DOES NOT LAST LONG!,"Do not purchase the CX series of Epson all-in-one units without an extended warranty (better yet, purchase another brand such as HP that has a better design) as it will not last long after initial warranty.When first purchased, I thought this was a great all-in-one and was happy with its initial performance. However, soon after (around warranty expiration time) the print cartridges get clogged and due to its design (unlike HP and other printers) it cannot be fixed (would cost more than original price of printer) so it then becomes only useful for scanning but cannot use printer or photocopier. It is basically useless to me now.I will think twice before purchasing another printer from Epson, and would definitely not purchase anything from the CX series of Epson All-in-One units."
1,Clogged up yellow and magenta heads in less than 2 months,"I had great luck with my previous Epson Color Stylus 640. When my older printer finally met its days (5 years old) I decided to buy an Epson MFP, and I bought a CX5400. It was GREAT for the first month. In the second month I had to do a LOT of head cleanings and nozzle checks. I replaced the color ink cartridges when my CX5400 was about 1.5 months old, and every since then the yellow and magenta inkjets are so clogged they will not print. I even purchased solvent from someone that had a similiar situation so that I could unclog the inkjets, but I have not had any sucess. So, now I have an Epson MFP that prints only in black and blue. Epson support staff has also been unhelpful. They can only recommend that I ship in the unit to Epson for repair at my expense.Now I'm looking at HP and Canon MFPs."
1,Stay far away from this waste of money,"This printer simply has no other use than using your hard-earned money, causing you plenty of headaches, giving you messy fingers, making you waste your time and effort trying to repair, and finally making a big fat hole in your wallet.PS: I would prefer to give it no stars, but amazon does not give me this option."
1,A big let down,"I will never buy an Epson again. This was my second epson printer and my first AIO. Unfortunately after I replaced the ink for the first time, the black ink dried within a few days on non-use. I wasted all most all the ink trying to get clean the head and get the head unclogged. But no-go and it never worked again after that.Besides I also read that there are other issues with Epson Cartridges like showing the cartridge as empty when infact there is ink left in the cartridge."
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy this piece of junk","I too have fallen victim to this ""printer."" It would be perfect if I were publishing a conceptual art novel which consisted solely of 500 blank pages; for any other purpose, the CX5400 is worthless by the time you've replaced the ink cartridges a time or two.A previous review described this problem as annoying but fixable, which strikes me as misleading. It is possible, in principle, to fix this problem yourself, but it requires opening up the machine and messing with its guts (manually cleaning out tubes, etc.), and EVEN THEN it still might not work.Save your money and buy another brand. Epson ought to be ashamed of themselves."
1,Don't Buy. Don't Replace the Ink.,"Zero stars really. Same story as everyone else. I hardly ever used this printer; not for photos, not for copies, hardly anything. For no apparent reason the black ink stopped printing even though we just replaced it. After cleaning the nozzles we needed to replace all of the color inks. We spent $73 replacing all the inks from Epson. Now we get only BLANK PAGES. No support from Epson. I stayed on hold waiting for the returns department for over an hour and eventually hung up. They don't take returns on opened ink. I think my credit card company guarantees purchases against like this You might want to try yours too if you're stuck with ink you cannot use."
1,Epson Disappoints; Sad to Say: Will Never Buy Again,"I have had the same problem as the rest. The purge tube came loose and the printer stopped working correctly. Wasted a lot of expensive ink trying to get it to work before I knew about the tube (an obvious design flaw); replaced it, it worked for a while but now, even though the tube is in place it does not work properly. I have been a fan of Epson for more than 10 years but the fact that they won't even respond to my emails means I will NOT be buying another of their products. Sad to say."
1,ok till change ink,then bam forget about itimpressed so much purchased one for a friend toothen thought SHE was technically challenged when printer no longer printed after changing cartridgeNOWjust like everyone other reviewer hereI say this should have never progressed thru the beta stageas soon as you have to change the cartridgethen you might as well throw it awayJUNK
1,"great for 1st year, then cloggs and can't unclogg it",my experience was the same as many people here - the printer only works for a year. then junk
1,Clogged Cartridge Heads,"This is the second Epson Stylus I've owned. First was a CX5200, that one died from clogged print cartridge heads, I screwed around with Espson tech support for many wasted hours. They sent me two different machines, the second being a CX5400. Both replacement machines arrived with print cartridge problems. I traded the 2nd replacement CX5400 in (at no cost) for a new CX5400 and got 13 months out of it until today. The yellow and magenta cartidges started to clog, I ran the head cleaner, once, twice, etc. and it just keeps making it worse, I think the cleaner sponge gets caked with ink and the caked ink smears over the cartridge nozzles and keeps making it worse with every cleaning. Don't waste your time with this piece of xxxx!! I'm going back to an HP. PS: I've got three new color cartridges left over, I'll sell them cheap."
2,Epson CX5400 problems,"I have had an Epson CX5400 for a little over a year and it just died. While it was working it was able to print photos and text at a decent quality, but it was terriblely slow. I called Epson to help troubleshoot my problem and they pretty much told me that the problem was caused by leaving the computer turn on when it was not in use. This was my first time hearing of this causing the problem. I believe I'm going to replace it with something different."
5,Value for Money,"Bought this all-in-one at a local retailer first. Loved it. So bought anotherone as a gift thru amazon.com. Amazon.com price is low by $55. Though shipping is kinda expensive but when compared with 8.25% tax, it equals it out. Amazon price was including tax.It prints good quality photos. Had an old faded photo which I scanned. Using the software gave it a touch and it printed out excellent. Text printing is good.Unlike other printers it comes with USB cable which saved me another $28.Epson allinone printer for under $150. Can't go wrong with it.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to use it at home. Take photo printouts and to give touch to old faded photos. Quality!No doubt in giving this printer 9 out of 10 points."
3,Not Compatible with Mac OS 10.3.2,"I purchased the unit as a gift with a laptop (iBook G4, 933, OS 10.3.2).It will print.It will not scan!It will copy.Epson should release the scanner update by December 22, 2003."
1,Was naive to believe this was a good product,"I purchased this product and was then told of the reputation that EPSON products had, so I came here to read the reviews. At that time I thought that most of the postings on here were a vocal minority. However, to my utter dismay my printer simply stopped working after 11 months of use. I changed the black cartridge and shortly thereafter the print quality began to fail. Changing the three colour cartridges simply made the problem worse, and cleaning the print heads left the machine so hopelessly clogged up that it was rendered useless. Luckily the store I purchased it from gave me a complete refund for this hunk of junk. Shame on EPSON for making such poor quality machines - please stay away from any of their products until they learn to put products on the market that actually last longer than one ink cartridge."
1,A junk,"I just bought one on sale. The color print came out in mostly green, and I found out that the red and the yellow inks were not coming out properly. I tried to clean the nozzles as per instruction. After about 10 tries, the nozzles cleared somewhat, but the print came out with many lines and spotty places. Furthermore, cleaning consumed a lot of ink! The cartridges were only about 65% full after cleaning, even though I have not had a single acceptable print since I bought the machine!!!Avoid this junk."
1,Great printer - when it works,"Sigh... I've used these reviews and online forums alot to help guide me in purchases and this is my first ""give back"" in posting my own thoughts. I really like the print quality of the epson printer and the ease with which to operate the all-in-one features, but the fact that I've had two printers in a row catastrophically fail on me along with the similar failures (google search for ""epson printer stopped printing"") means that I won't be buying another Epson product for a long time. From what I've read it appears that there is a design flaw with the vacuum tube coming off internal to the printer. I've replaced the ink cartridges twice and not a single drop of ink comes out. Last time Epson sent me an upgraded printer (CX6400) and I have not called them yet, but now I can't print my Christmas cards so not sure what I'm gonna do - but I won't be buying an Epson!Better wishes to you if you buy an Epson..."
2,Get Ready for Ink Clogs to End Your Love For this Machine,"I have just gone through my 2nd Epson Stylus Scanner/Copier/Printer in 2 years. I use it almost every day. However, my 1st one died for the same reason my 2nd one did. The ink jets get clogged and no amount of running cleaning/adjustments/alignments can start it printing again. I've always used Epson inks and bought them from reputable office supply stores. I hear this is a problem with these Epson products. I was fortunate that Epson replaced my 1st one before my warrantee was up...they are aware of these problems. Now my third purchase is up to me.(Wouldn't you know that I just bought more ink this morning.)"
1,Unreliable after one year,"If you're expecting this printer to last you for at least 1 year, don't count on it. I started having problems with mine after less than a year. THe printer gets worse with each nozzle check and eventually, I couldn't print anything at all."
4,Almost Perfect,I have an HP that I use at the office and the problem with it is that it has one cartridge for all 3 colors. The CX5400 has tanks for each color. I like that. I like borderless photo printing and the ink isn't too expensive.My only qualms are that the CX5400 doesn't have a backlight on the lcd screen and it doesn't have EnergyStar to shut off when not in use.Other than that...it's a great product.
1,2 years later...it stopped printing.,"Worked great at first. I absolutely loved this printer, scanner, and copier.But after about the 4th ink change and about 2 years, it stopped printing. I found out there is a problem with the ink tube getting clogged (due to a flaw with the Durabrite ink) or disconnected. I was able to find a website that explained how to disassemble and correct the problem. It was very difficult, time consuming, and messy. But it did fix my printer. It worked for about a month, but now it's not working again.I guess I'll try fixing it one more time...but when the ink runs out, I'm not buying any more. A new printer stocked with ink costs about the same as a set of new ink cartridges for this puppy. So why bother if it's just going to break again?!The scanner has always worked flawlessly. I guess I could keep this thing as an oversized scanner."
2,Don't Buy this one,"I bought this printer approximately 2 years ago (2004) and, after only a year, it no longer prints! I now just use it as a scanner. I can't use the copy or print function because the ink doesn't come through to the page! I replaced the ink twice with all new Epson cartridges, thinking that it may be a malfunction of the ink, but it still doesn't print. This is the same thing that happened with the Epson CX5400 I convinced my cousin to get. Hers doesn't print either...so I know it's not just me. The scanner works great, but that's all its good for now. I do like Epson products, but this one really disappointed me and I don't think I will buy another Epson. I am currently on Amazon looking for another printer. And I thought I should warn everyone!"
1,it was worth my time to bash it,"This is my first ever review on ANY item...This thing works real well, great qualty finish.. yet it shakes with a richter scale.. after about a year, the 2nd time i tried to replace the freagn expensive cartridges... it wont print... it would pretend to print... out comes a blank paper.i read somewhere that it basically became a 'paperweight' and INDEED it was. all i used it now is for the scanner... but i just bought myself a canon mp500.. a hella high rated printer to go along with the canon sd700IS digital camera that i got... bye bye epson!oh yea, i never even used a drop of ink from the new cartridges that i bought for this and it read that they were being used... WTF!"
2,Epson common problem,"As I been used Epson printers for years and recognized that the printer head will start to dry out if it has not been use in more than 2 weeks after 6 months of usage. I would recommend myself as to all Epson fans should print at least once per week to keep the ink in the printer head flows. If your printer have problem starts to print with cut out lines, just remove the print head and deep into hot water for about an hour. You will have much more chance to get the print head clean than to give it up. That's what I normally do, and it works. You also can use cleaning alcohol instead of hot water !!!!"
1,On Second Unit & It Died,"This unit is loud when the paper is feeding, but when working the prints are very good but the ink jets clog easly. My first unit ink nozels quit working under warranty and EPSON sent a replacement and this unit lasted about 6 months and not that unit is not printing so I will not purchase another 5200."
1,MOST HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE EVER!,"Purchased this all-in-one BRAND NEW IN BOX through Amazon in June, 2004. Item once installed had perpetual scanner error due to various DEBRIS under scanner glass.Upon reporting this to Epson, they proceed to ship me a REFURB to replace a NEW PRODUCT. The REFURB did not come with a USB cable, also had DEBRIS under scanner glass, and the print head was OLD thus producing AWFUL print jobs.I have been a fan of the HP printer for over a decade, and tried another manufacturer at my partner's request. I will not pay two cents for an Epson printer, EVER."
1,Love to hate this printer/scanner/everything but works,"The CX5400 I have is a replacement for the CX5200 which had the same problems I'm having now.It works great until I need to change the ink cartridges. The ink will NOT flow from 3 of the 4 colors. I've spent too much time on the phone with tech support (not toll free) as they instruct me how to do a ""head cleaning"" a minimum of 9 times.I am now stuck with another huge paper weight and I'm about to call to request a refund."
1,BEWARE - This printer will be a giant paper weight ...,"After owning this printer for about 13 months, it prints only blank pages. If you don't believe me, click on this link: http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/29681Honestly, I have owned and purchased only Epson printers for myself and my family for almost 10 years, and this is the last one I'll ever buy. Every single one: Stylus 400, Stylus Photo 870, Stylus C82, and now the CX 5400... they have gone bone dry even though I replace the ink faithfully whenever needed and treated it with care. Yes, I was stupid enough to keep buying Epson, but now I'm the wiser. And Epson isn't doing anything about it except telling their customers to send it in for repair. No thanks. Don't buy it. Yes, it printed unbelievably nice pictures when it worked, but now it's a giant paper weight that I'm about to throw out."
1,Epson now the worst,"As a dedicated Epson user (3 Epsons at home and 4 at work over the past few years) I have arrived at the conclusion that Epson quality is no more. The CX5400 I have died after 18 moinths from the fatal manufacturing flaw that so many 5400 users complain about. That flaw is the ink tube clogging and being almost impossible to repair. The same thing has happened to the CX4200 I have at work. Take my advice, Epson is no longer the standard in inkjet printers. The Durabrite ink may be the undoing of Epson. This ink is far too prone to clogging. If Epson does not make a change and soon they will be at the bottom of the heap if they are not there already."
1,Will never buy another Epson!,"I have the Epson CX5200 and loved it at first. But everyone is right...it starts to clog and then you have serious problems. I can print black and blue but no yellow or magenta, which means you can't print anything in color. I have tried everything...new cartridges, cleaning the print heads, aligning the heads, etc...nothing works. It seems like several other people have had the same issues with this series. Epson needs to correct this issue before putting other printers on the market! I am now looking for a new printer but you can bet it won't be an Epson!"
1,"Great until I ended up in the ""clogged print head"" group","The printer was really great, and convenient when I first bought it. I must have owned it for almost two years. I paid $99 for it. I really feel bad for people who bought it when they first came out. I must have put two or three sets of genuine Epson Ink (effectively paying another $99). Then I used some non-oem ink which worked fine for a while. Then out of nowhere the thing prints blank pages. I thought maybe it was the non-epson ink, but it seems that it was just poorly designed.I tried fixing it, but it didn't work, and cracked some plastic piece inside the printer anyway when reassembling it.At least the scanner still works ! : )Will buy a laser, had enough of ink problems and being ripped off for it."
1,black ink stopped printing!,"Like others, I also have a problem with the black ink not printing. I tried a new cartridge and cleaning nozzle heads to no avail. I guess I'll be shopping for a new printer. :("
1,Avoid this one if you want a printer to last,"Like many, many people, I liked this printer until it turned about 16 months old, and then the printer heads clogged. Do an internet search on ""CX5400 print head clog"" and you'll see what I mean. If you insist on buying it, just don't stock up on the expensive ink or you'll be stuck with worthless inventory when the printer inevitably dies."
1,Worst Printer I have ever seen,As posted by others the Printer Head had clogged after a while. Make sure that you use your printer regularly or else the printer will stop working. The printer acts as if it is printing but produces only blank pages. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER or any EPSON products for that matter.
1,Ink on my face,"Broken record of a review. The print heads hopelessly clogged after about a year. Not only that, when i disassembled as much as i could, i found the ink tube/straw feed to the heads had popped off, which is why nothing at all was coming out. You need to be a surgeon with unattainable instruments to put the tubes back into one another (they're both about the same diameter).Lexmark=junk, Epson=junk, now i have to try a Hewlett-Packard.This problem is unfixable as my ink stained hand and high blood pressure will attest. Screw you, Epson."
1,Not durable,"I've had this printer for a bit over a year. It worked just great and I was really happy with it, but then... it stopped printing colors and then stopped printing black. After some research I found there is a known problem where a tube at the bottom of the printer clogs with ink. The tube pops off. I followed the directions to fix it (which involved taking the printer apart and several hours of work) and I'm printing again, but not great. Print quality is terrible. I would not recommend buying this unit because the fix is not something an average user would want to do."
2,Worked like a champ... for a while,"I too paid a low price for this all-in-one when I bought my Mac. I was happy with the printouts as well as the copier/scanner features for some two years before it stopped working. From what I understand, that's pretty good for one of these units. It did go through ink cartridges fairly quickly, but apparently some of that is an issue with the Epson printers/cartridges themselves - see the news concerning the class action lawsuit against Epson (In re Epson Ink Cartridge Cases). I suppose if I found another printer that guaranteed me a minimum of 2 years of quality printing/copying/scanning at a super low price, I'd have to at least consider it a viable option."
1,"Once bitten, twice shy","I've had my CX5400 for about a year and...you guessed it, it now prints nothing but blank pages! I'm very disappointed with this all-in-one printer (purchased all new ink cartridges, ran several cleaning cycles - still won't print). From what I've seen, I would guess that if you don't use the printer on a daily basis, the ink will get clogged and it won't print. I'm now researching other printers and would be very hesitant to purchase another Epson.As anyone who's purchased this printer knows, if the printer says ANY cartridge is low, it isn't going to print ANYTHING. Many people, like myself, purchased new cartridges to either try to fix the problem (running cleaning cycles uses a lot of ink) or because the printer indicated the cartridge was low and replacing it seemed to cause the problem. Epson must be making a fortune on the sale of ink cartridges for this printer which is probably why I got it for such a reasonable price. Buyer beware!"
1,All-In-None,"Failed just like in the other reviews. Now it sits with a brand new ink cartridge (Epson Ink, of course) collecting dust. We'll see how long the scanner lasts. I am definately never getting another Epson printer."
2,Poorly performing Epson CX5400,"Exactly the same story as many other customers. We bought our printer about 15 months ago. It worked fine until this week, and we have now exactly the same head clogging problems as everyone else. I too have just wasted about 50 buying niw cartridges to no avail. What I really object to is the environmental disaster of having to throw away a piece of elctronic equipment after a relatively short time, I would far prefer to mend it but it seems impossible, plus I can't hang around for weeks, I've got stuff I need to print now."
1,Goodbye Epson!,"I too join the disappointed Epson CX5400 users. One minute I am printing good...black ink ran out, replaced...BLANK PAGES ever since. I even replaced cyan & and magenta...money wasted. My sister experienced the same with Epson cx82. We're looking at a different brand. I t would be honorable if Epson would do a recall and fix this issue....DMATT"
1,Part of the Clogged Nozzle Club,"Count me as part of the prestigious clogged nozzle group. Nothing I can say hasn't already been mentioned elsewhere, but I did find a walkthrough on fixing it:[...]It's not for the faint of heart, though. I consider myself pretty electronics/mechanically inclined and I'm a little wary of attempting this. If my printer was under warranty I'd just send it in, but I don't have that option unfortunately."
1,epson cx5400 thumbs down,I bought this piece of junk in 03. I don't print very much but am on my 3rd set of inks. And the nozzle is plugged. The black quit working even with a brand new cartridge. It seems to use and waste ink during head cleanings. So now with the head clogged I'm using up all my ink even though I can hear it sloshing around inside the cartridge. I have spent 280$ on this loser and am going to buy an H.P. this weekend that reuses the ink during the head cleaning process and makes beautiful photos for 169$ If I could rate Epson any lower I would. Quick math. 280$ Divided by 400 documents =.70 per doc. Whew!!!!!
1,CX5400 appears to be a crapshoot and I lost,"Worked well for nearly three years, but started churning out blank pages even with brand new and full ink cartridges.While it was working, we subjected the printer to light use. Given widely reported similar problems, I decided to junk the CX5400 and get a new [Canon] printer.This is not intended as a blanket condemnation of Epson. The CX5400 is worth avoiding, however."
2,Latent Defect ?,"After two years of minimal use, my CX5400 has died an early death. Loaded with brand new Epson certified cartridges it failed to print - ""clogged printer tubes"". Not willing to perform the ""surgery"" described on the various blogs, I called Epson. They by passed the ""troubleshooting"" protocal and gave me a deal on another Epson product (CX 6000)and threw in an extra set of ink cartridges because of my dilemma. I trust that the new replacement will be much more reliable than the discontinued CX5400. Stay tuned."
3,"Okay for what it is, but may not be of great use","I picked up an inexpensive used copy of this, hoping it would give us some new songs to play in church. What it had was 75 common hymns, with the soprano and alto parts pretty much as found in a hymnal. No vocals are included, and a fair number of the hymns I found were in different keys than in my church's hymnal so not really useful. The rest were often almost identical to the song in the hymnal so wasn't really giving me anything I couldn't use directly from there. There were some that had some notes transposed to stay in the recorder range, but many had very high notes (high B and high C) that for an intermediate player like me, just aren't reachable with reliability. If you want to just play some instrumental hymns with two recorders, and don't have a hymnal, this might be worth getting. But it really doesn't seem to offer much unique music that would be that useful for doing services."
3,"Works great, but hard to clean","I like this rice cooker. My earlier one (farberware) - I used for years, but it makes my countertop messy, because the lids wobbles a lot. I thought this one will keep my countertop clean and it does. It also cooks rice very well, since very little moisture is lost.But there is only one reason, I will be buying another and will use this, when I expect large number of people. The reason : difficult to clean.Im a person who cleans everything that is used for cooking neatly. But the top of the lid can not be removed and cleaned.So, slowly food can get deposited there. Though I keep cleaning it with soap solution, Im not happy. Id like to clean it like any other lid, thoroughly with hand or in dishwasher.Tip :For all the people, who say they burnt the rice, I suggest adding more water and see for the type of rice they use."
2,"Dry rice, burnt at bottom","I am not happy with this cooker at all. I used to use a friend's National rice cooker, which looked exactly like this one (except for the pink flowers on the National), but they are not the same. There was no trial and error with water proportion on the National. With this Panasonic, the rice is dry, it is not tasty,and it burns at the bottom."
4,Great rice cooker,"Its a very good rice cooker from panasonic. I usually use it to cook basmati rice and each time it turns out to be perfect.The only disadvantage is that if i keep it on warm function for some time, the rice turns brown. In general, an excellent rice cooker. Totally worth the price."
1,Dangerous!!!! The inner layer will slough off SOON!!!!,"I brough this in last Aug. I actually use it on Dec. The inner layer ( the nonstick layer) start to slough off in just one week, if you want to stay healthy, I strongly recommon you not to buy this item, I am not kidding!!! I call Panasonic, they told me to send back the cooker to them,and they will repair it, I don't know how they repair a nonstick layer??!!. This is the only rice cooker I have, if send it back to them, that means I have to buy another one, so, once you buy something is not good in the internet, that cause you a lot of trouble, so you need to think about it!!!!"
1,"Buy another brand, will give you a spoiled rice in 2 hours.","The appearance and the wattage savings is absolutely fantastic, but it will give you a spoiled rice in 2 hours. It will cook your rice, then after a while, your rice will smell bad and wet on the sides. I tried 3 different rice and the outcome is the same, then I switched back to my old Zojirushi and it was fine. Maybe the heat or the wattage is too low."
3,Be careful,Worked fine for more than a year until it fell from the kitchen counter to the vinyl covered floor and then directly to garbage can.
2,would not recommend for everyday Rice Eaters,"This is not the best rice cooker I've ever owned. It makes the rice hard after about 5 hours. I would have to turn it off after that time. Such a hassle to have to reheat rice at your next meal.The color, look, and price is Awesome. But not worth for Everyday Rice Eaters to purchase."
1,Terrible for Vegetables!,"What a waste of money! We bought this because it's hard to find a stainless steel steamer. It takes much longer than our old one to steam, and there really isn't enough steam to do broccoli or green beans. It may be fine for rice, but with a family of 4, I don't have time to wait on this thing."
1,Received a used item!,I recently bought what was suppose to be a brand new Rice Cooker only to receive an obviously used one. My rating of 1 Star is based soley on the fact that Amazon.com sent me a used item. I will be returning this item as soon as possible. Once I get my new Rice Cooker I will give it an honest rating.
3,roll top cheaper,This desk top desk is made of cheep wood and sticks can't open and close at will tried soap and wax with no luck. Otherwise size and storage for stamps etc is great
3,chris,This charm has nice detail but it is extremely small. I should have ordered a little bit bigger one. I may have to order a light house charm to go with it.
5,Finally a metal band that's not a one or two hit wonder!!,I am a first timer to this group and already I can't stop playing this record every song with a profound meaning like I've never heard before. I haven't heard their first one yet but if it is anything like the new one then I'll be blown away twice as hard by this band. I recommend this one to all these guys are truely for real!!
3,its good but,"i really wanted to like this cd, i really did, but im afraid that ill nino is going where all the other Nu-metal bands went. Guess Nu-metal is dead. it's a shame that all those good bands sound the same though. i give it a 3 cause their are some good songs on here, but this cd is nothing compared to their debut cd in my opinion."
3,"Good, but Revolution Revolucion is better","I think the title summarizes what I have to say pretty well. THe album is good, but not that good. I think their Revolution Revolucion album is a LOT better and definitely worth buying instead of this one. This one actually isn't that bad either, but I just have a strong preference to the other and listen to it much more often -- it just sounds much better."
3,Wonderfull ....but,"I just love this band, all my friends talk about them but i never listened to their album, one day i decide to listen and i just love but...the lyrics of this album are too pop for me...the bands of new metal are becaming so repetitive...if you listen one... you listen all (Sevendust, Staind, POD etc etc..)i think this second album remind me a cool band that became so famous as boring (Linkin Park)I love this ""New Metal"" thing, but i think we need something really ""New"""
3,"""A"" For Effort","Looks like Ill Nino have officially stepped out of the shadow of their loser mentor, the washed up Max Cavalera, and come into their own with a blend of Latin-spiced ingredients reminscent of bands from Machine Head (thank new axe-man Ahrue Luster for that) to Linkin Park (gross but intriguing in this context. Songs like ""Te Amo... I Hate You"", ""When It Cuts"", and ""Re-Born"" really punctuate the high points of the album, but the single ""How Can I Live?"" is surprisingly the disc's best track. Check this one out... but don't look for the second coming."
2,Ill Nino not more that old Ill Nino,"Ill Nino for me personally in the ""Revolution, Revolucion"" cd is a great cd i love it every song of it and it was that good and now they don't have that anymore they went from good to kinda good the songs that i still like this album that sounds like the other is ""Te Amo.. I Hate You"" and it's not that good but i like ""How Can I Live"" too though but it's just not THAT impressive"
4,Very Good,"This CD wasnt quite as heavy as Revolution Revolucion. Its alot more radio friendly, but there is alot more emotion. The musicianship is nothing mind blowing, but the latin rhythms they incorporate into their music are pretty interesting, and the drumming is actually pretty decent. The vocals are alright, the screaming sounds pretty good but the vocals sound kind of nasal at times. The lyrics arent great. Some songs the lyrics are good, but there are a few stupid lines in this album that bring it down. But overall all of the songs hold high quality and I would recommend this if youre into nu-metal or if you liked Ill Ninos last album."
3,"ill nino, where art thou?","""revolution revolucion"" had to be one of the best cd purchases ive made in a while-nothing slowed that album down.now with ""confession"", ill nino tries to be something theyre not-a mainstream metal band.the first couple of songs, like ""te amo i hate you"" capture the intensity from the last album, but after that, you can tell ill nino tried to push their material to an mtv like crowd, and not succeeding.im glad you can sing cristian, but your screams are what defined this band.the guitars dont impress me much, as they are jus to repetitive compared to the last cd.this album is very commercialized, and you will be able to tell in comparison with ""revolution revolucion"".if you liked the first, you should have no problem taking this one down.for fans of reveille, switched, and otep."
4,"No Revolution Revolucion, but still a solid CD","Initially when I heard this CD I was kind of disappointed because it lacked the same aggression and energy as the first album. Songs like ""No Murder"", ""Predisposed"", ""What Comes Around"", ""Unreal"", etc. were songs with great energy and aggression yet maintained excellent melody. This album seemed more focused on melody and not the aggression part of the music, but after giving it several thorough listens I found this progression to be that of a good one, and although I don't like it as much as their first album, their follow up is still very well done. My favorite tracks are ""Cleansing"", ""This Time's For Real"", and ""Letting Go."" I hope more nu-metal bands can successfully incorporate melody into their music as Ill Nino has been able to do."
5,ill nino does it again with the metal materpiece,"Where do I start with this CD? If any of you have read my other reviews of artist's albums, you would know that I am a critic and I never give anything 5 stars unless it's truley deserving. This CD, my friends, is very deserving. It starts out with the pounding love/hate song called ""Te Amo...I Hate You"". The song just radiates anger and contempt for the B.S. that relationships put people through. It flows right into the hard hitting single ""How Can I Live"" and just keeps going at an amazing pace. The song ""Life...Lifeless"" is in my oppinion, the best ill nino song to ever be put out. In short, buy this album. Do yourself a huge, huge favor and buy this album. I'm out."
4,This book is very good for beginers.,"THis book is a very good for beginers.It tells you how to get started.It is also good for peaple hoo have ben in paintball for A wile because it teaches you stradigys,team skills,and hand signals.I trouly liked the book a lote."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"If you are a serious paintballer, your not going to hide out in the woods alone as he describes in the book, your going to work with your team. Sniping might be good for 1 or 2 tags, but in speedball, you have no chance. Sniping is the worst possible strategy you can use. Take my advice, im a tournament paintballer I know. Try it sometime, you get killed fast...."
3,worth it,"This book is worth reading no matter if you are new to the sport or very experienced. Someone previously mentioned that this book tells you bad tips, it does not. He said that snipeing is a waste of time, but most paintballers know that you dont really snipe on a SPEEDBALL FIELD! This book gave me some better tactics to be a sniper but you cant just decide to be one over night you have to practice like the guy who bad mouthed the book before did not. If you want to try snipeing read this book and practice a little on some wooded fields and you will find that it is much more efficent than wasteing 1,000 rounds every five minutes on a speed ball field, this book tells you some tips on how to do so."
3,About the book.,This book is out dated but still have some good ideas for the new players. It is a good book if you are just starting to get into the game. The book is mostly about being a sniper on the paintball field. It has some good strategy for new and old players but some of the equipment that he talks about is old. I found the book vary interresting for a out dated book.
1,Who is the Wizard anyway??????,"This book is written by a man who refers to himself as The Wizard, like he is diserving of an alias. However, this book is extremely humorous because it is so outdated and some of the games he mentions that you should play are outrageously dangerous. These games could only be safe if you were throwing the paintballs. He says to do stuff like stand back to back (old west style) and walk 5 paces each away from eachother. Then you are supposed to turn around and shoot!!!!!! I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy being hit from so close that it makes you bleed!!!!!"
1,Mediocre,"The elements are elementary, consisting of only defenders, and a small portion on advancement, etc. I am very dissappointed"
4,a book for snipers and defenders mainly,overall a good book does not concentrate as much on offensive as it should but it makes up for it in the defensive area
2,DISCOURAGES ADVANCEMENT IN PAINTBALL,"Hey, I belive that this book should be spared because the aurthor of this book seams like a not verry accomplished paintball player. All of his tips and tactics are for a ""Snyper"" type player witch stays back in the field and is afraid to advance. So what I am saying is this book incourages being a wusy player and not a head-to-head front line, adrenile player and dose not give you tips to becaome one. So this book discourges advancing your paintball game."
1,Total Rip Off!,"What a rip off! $30 for nothing. The tube was dried out and what little there was did nothing to plump my lips.FusionBeauty LipFusion Micro-injected Collagen Lip Plump, Original"
5,TFP NA43,I purchased these to cover small dings around the fender lips of my car. I had to make dremel reliefs cuts to ensure a nice contoured fit. These are old school. You have to drill holes and screw these in. Afterwards I plastidip spray them to match my black car. They look like they came with the car.
4,Interior Designers Must Have,"Great photography and awesome scenarios. It really brings the feeling of being in Bali. And the decorations show the artistic side of the new interiors of the open living. It inspires my clients when they come inside my furniture store. Of the books I have from Bali, this is certainly the encyclopedia of interior design!"
4,Quite the way with words,"I found this a really fun read, with clever turns of phrase on nearly every page.The author avoids many an opportunity for melodramatic misunderstandings, a tendency more modern writers could learn a great deal from.Though some of the issues are dated, the core story finds a pleasant resonance in the parts of myself less then happy with this jaded world. Not that things were ever as simple as they in this book, it was a fun jaunt, with interesting characters and a cynical eye to unions, politics and women.Highly recommended."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Sadly, this DVD was a huge disappoint. I expected practical advice and tools to help me recognize and battle my own shadows, but instead I got what felt like an hour-long advertisement for the REAL Shadow Effect DVD, so I half expected the second DVD to be the program...Nope. The video was choppy, not at all cohesive and really didn't make any sense. There were no complete or organized thoughts, just snippets and general comments by some recognizable and well-respected leaders, Marianne Williamson and Deepak Chopra, and by some totally unrecognizable/unrespected others. I expected to be enlightened, but I am still in the DARK and out some money and time. I have to say, I feel as though maybe one of Debbie Ford's shadows is greed! This movie was a money-making scam. Don't buy it!"
1,INFOMECIAL,"The video would be ok if given free of charge as is only an infomercial, a nice one but still it is only advertising her ""program"". I have a book from her that haven't read yet, but now I'm not sure I want to..."
4,Out of the Shadows,"We all (individually and collectively) suffer from internal conflict, sometimes walking in sunlight...sometimes in darkness...most often somewhere in between. This is ably demonstrated through the unsettling cinematic techniques used in The Shadow Effect. The film seems designed to lure you into Ford's seminars but it's still worth the watch (more than once)."
2,"You're Buying an Infomercial, Not the Course","Hi, I am passionate about personal development, so I bought this DVD thinking I was getting something that would help me deal with my shadow self. What really upset me was that it glossed over the topic and did nothing to show us how to actually deal with the shadow other than very general advice like ""forgive yourself."" Then it says at the end to go to the shadoweffect.com to learn more and it takes you to a $149 course! It's a slick and engaging ""documentary"" but I really just paid $20 for an infomercial. Would never have expected this from Debbie Ford, Deepak Choprah and Marianne Williamson. I have read the positive reviews on this DVD and am appalled by how gullible people are when they see famous names. Yes this is an important topic, which is why I bought the DVD, but it's just an emotional and inspiring advertisement to get you motivated to do the expensive course."
3,Good movie,"...but where's the meat?I was more than a little disappointed to see that after you spend the $25 on the movie you are offered (what appears to be) another DVD with the practical application of the work for another $25 - and you get another copy of the movie that you can ""gift"" to a friend.Why couldn't I get the complete package to begin with?"
2,"lmportant Message, Little content","As you might guess from my title, the message is important and true while you don't get much from the movie. I was so expectantly waiting to see the movie to the point I wanted to purchase it. Fortunately I waited and got it from the library. The whole message is expressed in the trailer and for the rest is infomercial for Debbie Ford's courses. You would be better off buying any of her books."
3,the shadow effect,"the dvd was wonderful....if I could have seen the whole thing. It was defective, skipped parts and stopped in places. I didn't return it because of your return policy. By the time I paid s & h I would have been out MORE money...it would be cheaper to go buy another copy, locally."
4,Worth watching once,"I found that the content of this video was not new or different from what I have already read/learned. I was disappointed because I thought that there would be new information or information to help me deal with ""the shadow"". I do not regret watching it--however, i would have been much happier if i rented it or borrowed it.For people who are unaware of ""the shadow""--this is a great introduction and very user friendly. I would highly, highly recommend it to people just starting out."
2,Disapointed for sure,"I bought this as a gift for a close friend that I thought could use it based on all the great reviews. Three of us friends got together to watch it and all of us were disappointed and I felt bad for giving a crappy Christmas gift. It doesn't have any meat to it. It's really just a commercial and leaves you hanging and wanting more, which I'm sure is the point so you'll buy the course."
3,It was OK,For me this was not one of Deborah Smith's best work. It took a while to get into the book. It got better towards the middle and to the end. But her switches between Grace and Boone's point of view became confusing. It would take me a moment to figure out who was talking.I would recommend reading this book if you are Deborah Smith fan but I would not rush out to get it.
1,very disappointed,"I am a big fan of Deborah Smith, but found this one not up to her potential. I thought her attempt at humor fell short, and her characters unrealistic. For some reason, I felt like I was reading a cartoon without the pictures."
1,Not So Charming.......What Happened!,"I was so disappointed in this book....I ordered ""Ministers With White Collars and Black Secrets"" and ""Charming Grace"" together. I later found out that they are by two different people with the same name. Even though ""Ministers"" was great and I couldn't put it down, I found out that the sequel to that book is ""Robbed Without A Gun""...Still I decided to read ""Charming Grace"", it did not hold my attention and for 2 weeks now I have not been able to finish it. Too predictable, no excitement. Why pair these two books together....Charming Grace not so charming at all."
2,SOOOOOO Disappointing!,"I usually dive right into a novel by Deborah Smith and dislike coming up for air but with this one not only did I have to push myself to finish, I had to keep putting it down when disgusted with the main character's behavior. I will only mention one part of the storyline...Grace refuses to forgive (or talk with) her father since he never liked her first husband....she only forgave him after he hit someone. I completed the novel because even telling a very frayed yarn...Ms Smith is a gifted storyteller!"
1,Ugh........ what a waste of precious time!,"This book was terrible. Only reason I commited myself to finishing it was b/c I had already spent too much time trying to read it. Let's see.... in one word - stupid! When it got where Roarke named his 3 sons, I just 'bout chunked the thing out the window - how ridiculous!! Literally made myself finish this one just so I could honestly write a review!"
3,Somewhat contrived,"I've read pretty much all of Deborah Smith's books. I agree with others--this is not one of her best. The main characters instantaneously fall in love?? And the ""father/sons"" surprise?? But still worth reading.But the worst part was the missing words, wrong/confusing character references (like ""he"" when it should have been ""she""), weird formatting and punctuation, etc. that were in my Kindle edition--way more than I've seen in any other Kindle book. Did it happen in ""translation"" from the printed book? Who does this translation? It was awful!!!!!!!! Extremely distracting!!!"
2,So I'm not alone...,"I wondered why I was having trouble getting through this novel - good to know I'm not alone. I've enjoyed most of Deborah Smith's novels but am finding that with this latest offering, her work is becoming extremely formulaic. Two disparate characters meet: one a charming southern belle with quirky family, the other a rough and tumble outsider. Big sex scene smack in the middle of the book then somehow all gets resolved. It's becoming so predictable I know what's going to happen before I turn the page. It's too bad because Ms. Smith has genuine talent but before she embarks on another writing project she needs to get some fresh ideas."
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor",I have been a fan of Ms Smith's books for a while and Charming Grace was a total disappointment - the story was hard to follow; the characters unbelievable and the content generally like a really cheap soap opera. Not worth reading.
2,Nothing but clichés & similes!,"I've read everything this author has written and I've never been so disappointed in her work. I found myself wondering if someone is writing under her name. A number of people have written about how difficult it was to get through the book; well, I've tried and tried and finally decided I had to know if it was just me or if others had the same feelings. I logged onto amazon and now that I know that I'm not alone in my opinions, I quit! This is not worth finishing. Reading keeps me up at night way-past-my-bedtime, but 1-2 pages of this book puts me to sleep. (Maybe I'll keep it by my bedside, after all.)"
4,Nicole Nordeman: Live at the Doof,"I bought it because I love her version of ""Time After Time"". There are several other powerful songs on the CD. She has a great voice and a lot of soul."
3,Disappointing,"Having loved many of her other songs, I looked forward to this live album. However, this wasn't like many other live albums where you get improved, or at least livlier versions of the songs you love. This album seems to me to be like a studio album done in front of a crowd. The only notice you get of the audience is the applause at the end of the songs. The song Holy was a serious diappointment because it lacked any energy. Don't get me wrong. Nichole is still a great artist, and a fine performer. I just don't like this rendition of songs done live."
4,Great Artist: Good Concert.,"Nicole Nordeman's excellent writing is what has long intriqued me about her. The fact that she can sing and deliver her songs makes her that much more special.I saw where someone below basically said ""big deal"" about this concert performance. Well...the live version may not contain the polish that a studio performance may have, but I consider the trade of the polish for spontaneity and her character coming through more thoroughly in the live version an excellent trade-off. I'll take it: there's a time and place for both, actually.I'm sure any artist who has been touring for a while will tell you that, yes people want to hear the songs they came to hear, but they *also* came to ""be with you.""I felt like I was ""with"" Ms. Nordeman in the audience that night as I listen to the CD. Not a bad way to spend a few bucks."
4,Great CD... wish it were longer!,"There are only eight songs on this live CD, but if you're a die-hard Nichole fan, it doesn't matter. The live interpretations are fresh - bringing in an accordion on a couple of the songs - yet simple. It's accoustic Nichole, the kind I love best: just Nichole and her piano and a few friends to fill in here and there. Nichole is such a poetic songwriter, which is even more apparent when the music is stripped down to its basics, and it still sparkles."
4,Helpful,There is tons of helpful advice in this book from starting out to race day tips. I have read other marathon books and this is the most comprehensive guide including nice bonuses like pacing charts and more. I highly recommend it to those running your first or 10th marathon. It's full of helpful remminders and tips and is written in an attention catching way.
4,Good info for marathon newbie,"Learned a lot of new things about the marathon and strategies for completing it. With my first marathon coming up in a few months, I ordered several books. I definitely would recommend this one to others getting ready for their first."
2,Higdon's Ego,"The book has a lot of good material, once you filter through Higdon's self praise. Chapter through chapter, he boasts about his accomplishments. Let's face it, we know, that's why we bought the book."
4,Mostly motivational,"I'm training for my first marathon and was given this book by my cousin who has run multiple marathons. I should say that I am in college and have been distance running since I was around 13. I run for fun, not really for competition and the idea of a marathon intimidated me because it seemed like such a far leap from what I am used to.This book provides a lot of motivation but in ways I did not expect. I didn't realize upon getting this book that it was not only targeted to first time marathoners but also to people who really don't run. I found the provided training schedules to be a bad fit for my personal fitness. The novice schedules were too slow to start, and the advanced schedules were too intense. I also come from running 6, sometimes 7, days a week so only running 4 days is a problem for me.Ultimately, this book is a great marathon book and I really enjoyed reading it. However, I do think it is targeted to the non-runner and wish it was a little bit more advanced."
3,Stories About Marathons,"Like some other reviewers, I was looking for more structured information about preparing for and running marathons. I wanted more technical details about the physiological processes and how to counteract depletion better. I found the book less organized than I would have liked. I am surprised that someone who has run as many marathons as Hal did not have more non-obvious insights and tips."
2,Guides without Guidelines,"The Marathon Guide of Hal Higdon misses what many books miss when trying to reach as many potential readers as possible: Focus. The book promises to suit everyone's needs, first time marathoners as well as experienced marathoners. Even though the book starts with chapters written especially for three different levels of marathon performance, the book looses this concentration in the following twelve chapters. The author mixes content for experienced runners with content for beginners. A confusing and weakly structured work is the consequence. Undoubtedly, the author is an experienced runner and coach. But this disposition leads more to a description on ""how I did it"" than to suggestions how runners should behave to train for and run a Marathon. You could expect more from a ""ultimate training and racing guide""."
2,Waste of money and time,This book did not provide a good sense of how a regular runner can accomplish or improve a marathon. It was confusing and filled with information that was not helpful. Save your money.
1,Waste of money and time II,"I agree 100% with ""A Customer"" who previously wrote:""This book did not provide a good sense of how a regular runner can accomplish or improve a marathon. It was confusing and filled with information that was not helpful. Save your money."""
2,Condition of Book,"I thought the condition of this book was actually worse then what was described over the Internet. Little dissapointed by the 'half true' description of this book but overall I was ok with the rest of the 5 books that came together with this book. 5 out of 6 books in good condition, I'm ok with that."
3,Great for any runner,Great for the beginner through the intermediate runner. Advanced runners may want to look into another book. I have ran 20 marathons and I would recommend this book to beginner marathon runners.
5,An excellent guide for beginners and experienced runners,I have read this book over and over during marathon training and post training recovery. It has given me a lot of insight from many experienced trainers. This is the best book I have found for beginning runners (I am now on to my 5th marathon) both short and long distance. There is not one chapter that did not provide helpful information.
4,A must for novice marathoners,"After renewing this book from the library multiple times I just had to own it. My husband and I are training for our first marathon and this book is our ""bible."" There's a new piece of valuable information on every page, and each time I reread a section I find something I can use again. Inspiring, informative, with training schedules, advice, and anecdotes throughout. I've looked at other marathon training texts but this one is the best--written for the average reader, it doesn't take the elitest attitude toward running that some of the others do."
5,Great book!,The book has been great! Has multiple training tips and helped me modify my original marathon training program to better fit my goals. It really is a must read for anyone wanting to run the marathon.
1,A Waste of Video Tape,"I watched this movie last week. I thought it would be a great spoof documentary. I didn't think it was funny. I didn't think it was original. In my opinion, It was just another creation by someone who was trying to make a buck by using Elvis as subject matter.The lead actor (if you can call him that) will annoy you. When he started talking, I thought it was a woman. He leads you on a pointless journey through various bad characters who think Elvis is alive. Bad acting, bad music, bad from start to finish.The only thing I thought had any worth was the great artwork on the cover. The copy I watched, had a flasher-type cover (one that creates movement when turned from side to side). Worth maybe a $1.This movie is a waste of video tape. If you find Elvis fanatics funny and fasinating, watch a real Elvis documentary. It will provide bigger laughs then this poor spoof.Don't waste your money on this one folks.PS - The one star I gave this video is for the packaging."
3,ENJOYED THE MEDIUMS,"the film is a bit of a run around , and i would have liked it better if there had been more interactions with the psychic mediums. good concept but is elvis alive? the psychics could have told us!"
2,There is a reason this music doesn't sound as good...,"It's evident from the very first notes that this is a re-recording, and not a very good one at that. If you absolutely must have this music in some form, get this CD. To be honest, you'd be better off just playing the tracks from the DVD."
4,"Glass: old, yet new","Just voices and organ. Glass very often succeeds in making combinations of sounds that hit your ear in a way that makes you think: yes, that's exactly the way this music should sound.After the beautiful opening track 'The Music Box', the other tracks are a little reminiscent of parts from the Koyaanisqatsi sound track. Haunting, beautiful, but a bit more elaborate and with more variation.Though this will not become my favourite Glass album (nothing beats La Belle et la Bete...), I will play this cd quite often.It's Philip Glass as I like him: immediately you recognise his fingerprint, and yet you hear something new."
2,Where was the editor for this book?,"The characters were depthless and the situations are trite. The protagonist goes back and forth between desiring righteousness and embracing sin that you are never fully convinced of his moral conversion in the end. The contradictions in the novel are so staggering that you will become dizzy with stream-of-consciousness that falls flat.That doesn't mean this book doesn't have redeeming qualities. I was pleased to see some variety from the stock ""goody-goody"" Mormon characters, and there is a lot of subtle symbolism that might help people who feel they don't fit the classic mold of what is good but are still good people.I just thought the book was poorly written and the editing of the storyline was severely lacking. For an adult novel, the writing was surprisingly juvenile. I expected more from a creative writing English professor."
2,Disappointed,"I've only had this for 8 months and everything sticks to it. I've had $13 pans last longer. I use it about twice a week and only wash it by hand and don't use high heat. I had another Circulon pan, but I think it seemed to last longer because I didn't use it as much. I contacted Circulon and I would have to ship the pan back to them at my cost. Then they decide whether I deserve a replacement. I'm not big on gambling. The shipping cost pays for most of an inexpensive replacement. I think it will cost less in the long run to buy the cheaper pans. I thought I was making an investment in a quality product, but I was wrong."
3,A Solid Effort!,"International finance expert Callum Henderson provides a detailed, well-researched, and highly readable account of China's current economic situation. The book focuses specifically on how economic, environmental, and social problems threaten China's historic economic reform programs. What happens in China affects investment, markets, and economic policies around the world - issues Henderson investigates thoroughly. We at getAbstract recommend this book to all business people with an interest in China's economic climate - and if you conduct business internationally, this means you!"
4,An excellent way to see a different point of view,"I recently borrowed this book from a friend and was captivated by this book's theme. This book contains a lot of Chinese myths that tell stories with Chinese background, and has a very exciting point of view rather than the bland versions of some other books. I found it very exciting to see myths from other countries. A lot of young people will find this kind of topic too much to understand. Some story elements like the mood and themes were existant, but hardcore mythology fans will read this book like there's no tommorow."
3,Solid Transition Album,"I was never a big GFR fan. But this album does have some interesting material and I think overall, it was missed by most fans of Grand Funk. The instrumental Phoenix is a good boogie number. Rock and Roll Soul should have been a bigger hit for the band but I guess the transition away from Terry Knight created some lapses in marketing this album. To me, the album showed what this band would do when producing their own music. While a couple of the songs are great, I only gave it three stars since too many of the songs failed to come through for me."
3,Last of the great Funk!,"This recording always has a special place in my heart and hearing it again after all these years, the thrill is still there. At the time we were all a bit surprised at the inclusion of the keyboard guy, but we grew to like what they were doing on the recording. For many of us this was the 'love'album because slower tracks like Freedom is For Children and Why Should I Care For Someone, were really great make-out tunes in some of the dives that we frequented.This marked a change from the political anthems that they gave us at the time, which we put into an anti-apartheid context for our situation in South Africa. Comparing this to so-called modern rock you realise why today's music is all so bland. These cats had real talent and could really play the music without any gimmicks, just pure musicality. Mark Farner on guitar still sounds great. Pity they went a bit poppy after this"
5,still rocks after all these years,"Having been born in Flint, I naturally am prejudice toward Grand Funk. I remember when the live album came out and would have to say this is the best album they ever put out. The remix of ""Flight"" is outstanding."
5,An excellent field guide for FL residents & snake lovers.,"Provides color pictures, descriptions, range maps, and habitat information for each species of snake in Florida. The authors also describe similar species, natural history, and reproduction for each species. The book contains information (photos/description) of various FL environments (e.g. mangroves, cypress swamps,hammocks, pine flatwoods). Charts included provide abundance of each species in various environments. Good basic description on snake senses & locomotion. I plan to buy parts 2 & 3!"
4,Great & Useful Info,"I'm a beginner and found this book very useful. I would read a section, throw a few darts, and notice instant improvements. For example, I noticed the biggest improvements after I went from Vortex flights to standard flights after following the advice in the book. I then went to adjust my stance and throw. The book is very well organized. Some of the jokes are a little corny and the book could have been reduced to about 20 pages without all of the illustrations, but at the same time, the illustrations were helpful. It was also very fun to read. I'm not sure if this book would be good for someone more advanced, but it gave me the skills and general information to pursue the game of darts even further."
2,10% Information 90% Filler,"There is very, very little real information in this book. The vast majority of the pages contain full page cartoons illustrating 1 line of info that may or mey not be usefull. The author could have condensed the information into 10 ro 15 pages - but that would not justify the ... price tag. The ""how to"" aspect of the book is actually pretty helpfull, so if you're a complete beginner there may be some value. Other books, such as The American Darts Organization Book of Darts, offer just as much information and are filled out with history, game rules and other more usefull filler than the hundreds of cartoons in this book"
4,Der Stern von Bethlehem,"Although I have nothing to compare it to, I believe this to be the 1922 ""Der Stern von Bethlehem"", with music and narration added in the 1950's. This film by the the great Lotte Reininger (The Adventures of Prince Achmed) uses a technique of articulated silhouettes, filmed in stop action, for a marvelous ""shadow puppet"" effect. Against colored backgrounds, this technique still mesmerizes more than 85 years later. Reininger extracted some scenes from ""Achmed"" in the 50's, and either this is the same scenario, or she was able to re-create her style 30 years later. Either way, it's a winner."
1,arenot recomended,"low quality virtual surround sound, ugly as hell. I bought these becos I thought it was 5.1 surround but it is just a cheap and ugly stereo headset. if you want to make someone else laught via skype, I recommend to read a joke or something else."
2,low rider???? where are you,The only song i wanted to hear is not on the cd. I hear its hidden what is the trick to finding it?
3,pretty good,"this is a very good soundtrack, but it is missig a lot of the good music from the movie."
4,music to drive by,A well chosen and diverse soundtrack. Each song seems designed to keep your blood pumping along with the movie- a typical summer-fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants-Bruckheimer-adrenalin-fix. Thankfully there are no maudlin ballads. It is definitely not serious fare and it is fun to listen to in the car.
4,Great soundtrack!!!,"I loved this movie so I had to buy the soundtrack. This soundtrack is fulled with songs by some of the greatest artists. From Moby to Ice Cube and DMX. This soundtrack has a great mix of music. Rap, metal, pop, jazz. It's all in there. I would recommend this CD to anyone."
4,A solid soundtrack!,"This is a great soundtrack, better than the MI:2 soundtrack. It has songs from various artists. My favorite one is Flower by Moby, the music is played in the beginning of the movie. It also includes DMX hit ""Party Up"". Like any other Jerry Bruckheimer soundtrack, the ""theme"" music is in it. This soundtrack is definitely worth buying if your a fan of the movie!"
4,All that for 2 songs that I could have got on iTunes,You can now find the only two good songs on this soundtrack individually on iTunes. Don't waste your money buying the whole soundtrack.
4,Better than the film,"Although I thought the film itself was very weak, the soundtrack more than lived up to my expectations. There is a great variety of music here, headlined by big beat trailblazers Apollo Four Fourty and Groove Armada. Overall, the album is upbeat and powerful. You won't be disappointed."
5,Good as the movie!,"Just saw the movie and the soundtrack is just as good! Flower starts out the movie, and it literally takes off from there!"
3,Good CD - Could use some additions,"I liked the movie, and I like the music, but was dissappoted when a few songs were left out. I really miss 'lowrider' and the catchy tune when cage is at the ferrari dealer. Could use some work, but a good CD nonetheless."
4,All the Songs that You've heard of BUT BETTER,"Man. If only they could include the movie or dialogue or something onto the soundtrack so you can relive the experience of watching that movie in the theatre! OK, so Gone in Sixty seconds is not really Oscar worthy, but it was TOTALLY entertaining. And what made it better was the Soundtrack. The tracks on this album are all old songs, that are picked to accomapny the movie. Although you've heard it all... they truly describe each scene of the movie. The cinematography fresh and the music is extremely upbeat ! it's great to see how much music does to a movie! Even though most of these are old tracks that have been used in other movies, that's kinda what makes this album worth the money since its a compilation of GOOD STUFF. Get urself a copy and enjoy!"
3,Another Missing Song ?????,"I just saw the movie for the Mega Time {Love Both Versions} but the secondmovie soundtrack is awesome with all the artist.EXCEPT!!!!!That someone else asked ""Where is WAR's Low Rider""? Good Call. But after reviewing the song list I asked this question because a SECOND song ismissing.I just played the DVD & checked the song list & it is listed on the DVD,but it is not on either soundtracks offered ?Where is Jane's Addiction-Been Caught Stealing?Love the song,always remember the Music Video,but it is not on the ST.I bought the unedited version,but lets have a complete soundtrack."
3,Where is,Low Rider???? They played it right before the crew headed out for the big boost--major part of the movie!! I can't believe it wasn't included!!
1,The CLASSIC Failure in Soundtracks,"This soundtrack is really good if you have not seen the movie. If you have seen the movie it is just insulting. All too often a movie soundtrack will be full of good music from the movie, such a the Gone In 60 Seconds soundtrack, BUT there will be a fatal error made. In the movie, there is plenty of music. Some of the music is in the background, and Nicolas Cage and company actively listen to some. The fatal error is the only song that is actual a real part of the movie, Low Rider by War, is left out of the soundtrack. It truly insulting to go see a movie, notice a song that is actually a part of the plot, and find it is left out of the soundtrack. Forgive my judgmental nature, but I personally believe that a song should be included on a soundtrack if it used in the movie in any way, background or foreground. I take particular offense when foreground is left out for more popular music."
4,An All-Right Film About Driving,"With a soundtrack that is good for driving.'Gone In Sixty Seconds' is a relatively standard summer movie that is saved only by entertaining performances by a N. Cage-lead ensemble (watch Angelina Jolie and Vinnie Jones for some real fun), a flying Mustang, and an appropriately burning soundtrack.If you're worn out and ticked off by your week-day dealings, take a break and see the movie and then floor your Geo Metro all the way to the beach.Note: the inclusion of 'Low Rider' on the soundtrack release would have made for a more complete package."
4,"Good soundtrack, great movie","The music is good, however it is missing lowrider. The movie is fantastic."
5,Gotta Love This!,"This is just one of my favorite CD's. I bought it knowing I only liked maybe 3 of the songs, and was surprised to find the whole thing amazing. I have never been a fan of rap, but those songs on this CD just get you pumped and make you want to move. I highly recommend this for anyone with eclectic taste."
3,Why doesn't it time the 30 minutes of soaking too?,"I bought this little rice cooker, and it's charming. However, you have to soak the rice in it for 30 minutes before you can turn it on and start it cooking. Duh! Why isn't that built into the logic? I'm a crockpot queen -- the 'fix it and forget it' type of cook. It annoys me that I have to think about this thing after dumping the rice in, which defeats the concept of ""automatic"" in my book. Call me too demanding technologically, but why didn't they build the 30 minutes into its features? I don't understand the logic here. Anyway, I still like it and it beats cooking rice the old-fashioned way -- but it's not much of a time-saver or convenience with this thirty minute barrier."
1,Bad choice,"I got this to replace an old hitachi rice cooker (lasted 9 years). After trying it for a few times, I returned it. It takes too long to cook the rice, you have to soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking, then turn it on, then it takes about another 30 minutes. (I can make rice quicker using the stove). I followed the manufacturer's instructions, rice browned on the bottom, and cooked uneven. I tried to adjust the water, either rice turned out uncooked or too soft. The only thing good it was easy to clean, but so was my old Hitachi rice cooker that did not had the nonstick surface."
4,Nice cooker,I thought of buying a rice cooker . i already heared about this one from my friends. so i bought this one. its very easy to use and to clean. i got very nice cooked rice.i use this cooker to prepare fried rice . it came good. i love this one!!!
4,Good for students ONLY,"It's now a year old, but still very usable for the coding student. You're asking for BIG trouble if you take this to work and actually use it. It is no longer usable for 2003 and beyond. It should only be half priced."
5,Entertaining western with reliable cast.,"Timeless Media Group have done a fine job, considering the print they had to work with. I had previously purchased this film on a low rent VHS label over twenty years ago. That print was watchable but this one is much better. Chuck Connnors heads a solid cast including Aaron Kincaid, Peter Ford and veteran Cesar Romero in this tale of five Confederate veterans. Shaped by their Civil War experience, their only skills being mercenary, they head south of the border to ply their trade and soon find themselves engaged in a struggle between a military dictator and the people of a small village. Great music score adds to the film's atmosphere."
1,Poor Quality All Around,"I like Chuck Connors in most settings. However, this was clearly a low budget movie. The action was slow moving and the plot rather lame. I would not recommend this movie even for die hard Chuck Connors fans."
3,Watch Band,"The watch itself is great, all Timex watches are fantastic, but the wrist band is just horrible, it has frayed so quickly and is hard to put the strap through the loop on the band to secure the band on the wrist do to the fraying, so I need to find another band."
2,No velcro fast wrap strap,Nice looking functional watch.It is advertised as having a velcro Fast Wrap watch strap but instead came with a standard buckle watch band.
4,Stigma,"Excellent discussion of what stigma is and how it functions in modern American society. Goffman spends a good portion of the book discussion the phenomenon called ""passing"" and also ventures into how normals empathize with the stigmatized, as well as self-definitions of stigmatized individuals as ""normal""."
3,Assigning to students in Social Deviance,"Although they had a tough time getting past some of the language (i.e. terms that are no longer politically correct that were used when Goffman was writing), my students learned some important ideas from the book. They seemed to actually read it and were probably not intimidated by the theoretical nature of the book due to its brevity. Students quickly grasped that stigma arises within the work of social interaction, that normal is a problematic concept, and that identity and information management are on-going projects."
3,Very Blah... but Useful!,"Just like any other book that you I was forced to read by a professor, I found this book to be very dry. It was a struggle to pay attention at more than one place, BUT when I did manage to keep my focus, the information is very useful. I wrote an undergraduate thesis on stigma, and this book was my primary source, despite it's lack of excitement. SO, I recommend it for academic work, but not for pleasure."
1,somebody tell me,"Can anyone convince me that this books worth the time i spent reading it? not entertaining, not enlightening and definitely not useful. Give credit for using somany examples, but no, just call it ""The long introduction to Stigma"", theres no meat in the pie."
4,The ballet shoe - a little tight,"I order a size 8M, they are a bit tight. I'm not so sure you should order them as they might not run true to size and if I had happened to have ordered an 8 1/2, they would have been too tight.They are a bit thin, but they again, they are ballet shoes."
3,Good with one MAJOR weakness,"The Compaq Presario S5300NX is a nice computer. With Pentium 4 at 2.5G and 512M ram (exapndable to 1GB) it's got good speed. The 120GB hard drive provides plenty of space for all application and storage - and a CD burner in case you need more.However, with that kind of power, it has one glaring weakness: It's Intel Integrated video Chipset (64MB). With no AGP expansion, the 5300NX slows 3-D graphic-using programs way down. For example, Command and Conquer Generals (which states a minimum 32M card) runs very slowly. As I said, the annoying thing is that Compaq (HP) didn't even provide an AGP expansion slot - making it virtually impossible to fix this achilles heel - even if you wanted to.Normally, I would have given it 4 stars, but with all the power it has, the inability to do even a fair job at handling graphics that most older computers can, is an unforgivable oversight."
2,Buyer Beware,"The product description here is misleading - this product is not the movie that features Dolly Parton.Personally, I think that this point - that the video is not the movie - should be in the product description. Instead, the product description makes no mention of this, and the seller chooses to make the point in a product review."
4,good enough for the price,"I bought this headboard about 2 years ago. It arrived in several pieces and takes 2 people to put together. Not rocket science, but follow the directions. It has been a useful and sturdy piece of furniture for us. BEWARE: wipe up spills immediately! Liquid left for more than a couple of minutes will expand the particle board under the ""veneer"" and create a permanent rough spot."
5,Stellar work from Ayu!,"This is easily my favorite Ayumi album, and it's a short one! Each track is amazing, with Ourselves being my absolute favorite. Hanabi Episode II would be the weakest point, in my opinion, and it's still beautiful. The video is so sad!Which brings me to the videos... Wow, Because of You is... Oh I don't know how to put it. Ourselves is incredible, Greatful Days is good fun, and Forgiveness is simply beautiful. Ayumi as a fairy/angel? Beautiful! ^_^I would recommend this album to any Ayu fans, but I'd say to track it down somewhere cheaper (yesasia.com has good prices and legit product)."
5,awesome ambience!,"i'm a massage therapist and keep this cd on ""repeat"" for many of my shifts. often i find the deeply relaxing chord structures reverberating in my mind hours after i've left the studio. it's a great cd for relaxation, meditation, massage, yoga, or drifting off to sleep.i came here today hoping to get my own copy for home use, but unfortunately it's not currently available! persevere and get ahold of one if you can!"
5,precious and profound,"Phenomenal! This book is a keeper. I have read considerable books on this subject of what to expect at the time of death, what awaits on the other side, and how to connect with departed loved ones. These insights are shared by one who has already crossed over. This was the most in-depth exploration and explaination I have read so far. I think this awareness is crucial to ease the fear and give insight to the life beyond the veil thus making the transition so much smoother. It resonated with my heart...."
1,Not Good,"If anyone believes this tripe, you'll LOVE this book. If you have half a brain, you will HATE this book. Don't buy it."
3,The beginning of the decline.,"I was a huge Grand Funk Railroad fan in high school. I had all their albums up to and including the first live album which I played constantly. When Survival came out, naturally I had to get it. It turned out to be something of a disappoint and for me marks the beginning of the decline of GFR. I did like their version of Gimme Shelter which is why I gave it a rating of three. Although I liked We're An American Band and saw them in concert on that tour, their music was changing and for me it wasn't for the better. After E Pluribus Funk, I never bought another Grand Funk album."
5,A GEM FROM THE PAST,"This album, for some reason, is my favorite GFR album. I was 17 when Survival was released. I had it on an 8-track, which was horrible as songs were cut off to switch tracks. I just listened to this album and it truly reminded me of how often I played it, as every track came back to me. Country Road, Gimme Shelter, I Cane Feel Him In the Morning, All You Got Is Money- Just great stuff. Classic rock fans should check this album out. Definitely worth it."
4,True Survival,"I'm 48, the last time I owned this album was about 30 years ago. If you can put yourself at a place in time where technology wasn't the same you can listen to the sounds of creativity of this trio that desperately pushed the envelope of their instruments to redefine rock-n-roll. The night I received my CD on the mail I took the trip memory lane, and yes there they were waiting for me... Grand Funk Survival can still make me feel the things that I felt then, think the thoughts that I thought then, and remind me that if you want to keep a ""hand picked"" collection of rock through the ages, Survival is a must."
3,damn near album,almost as good as i remembered.they were always good back in the day but this is one of those c.ds that just leaves you looking for a peak in their music that never comes.
4,A Charming Little Book,"United States War DepartmentBodleian Library, University of Oxford; 2004; 31 pp.This is a charming book I received from a dear friend from Devonshire, England. It is a reproduction of an original pamphlet produced by the War Department in 1942. It was meant to give a brief introduction to Britain and its people and some words of advice to the servicemen shipping over to England to join the Allies in destroying Hitler. The writing comes across quaint and nostalgic from the modern perspective.I actually did learn a little about the geography and demographics of England. The discourse on the characteristics of Britons as seen from the American viewpoint was relatively true to form, I believe, and sometimes humorous as well."
5,Exactly as presented. Am very happy!,The booklet was exactly as presented. Perfect condition. I am very pleased with my order and the timely receipt. Thank you!
5,"An Excellent Primer On, and History of, Broadway and the Industry of American Theater",Athough a bit dated [written in 1969] this book gives a good overview of Broadway. Well written and funny its stories and characters [all real] are gems to behold. Anyone intersted in the Broadway Theater Industry will find reading this book time well spent.
5,Almost like Air Popped!,"This is awesome popcorn. I still prefer air popped popcorn but this is the closest microwave version that I have found, and it's organic. Now, come on and think, if you're looking to tons of butter and salt why would you purchase a 94% fat free unsalted food item. The cool thing is. since it is a fairly plain popcorn (not flavorless just plain) and you want extra flavor you can add just what flavor you're looking for... buttery, cheesy, sweet, spicy or salty. It's a very versatile popcorn."
2,seems generic with quality issues,"Product is as other reviewers note a bit bland and not without some oil.Though the outer package is a nice Newman's Own box, the packages inside are completely generic with a small dot-matrix message ""94% fat free unsalted"".After 2 purchases that seemed fine, the third is a bust - the popcorn will not pop! Using the same microwaves, after the normal cooking time very few kernals are popped and soon after everything starts to burn. Bag after bag has come out without any popped corn to speak of. With generic packaging and these cooking problems I wonder about the quality of the product.Note that the product is not returnable."
3,Popcorn Organic & Unsalted,"I was so excited to receive this delivery, as my body cannot take the vast amounts of salt in other products. After the bag popped, I found that the popcorn itself is very light and there are few unpopped kernels at the bottom of the bag. Imagine my surprise to find that unsalted, unbuttered, organic popcorn is very dry and tasteless! I eat the popcorn because I purchased it, but I really don't enjoy it that much. Adding a little salt to the popcorn after it has popped does not help at all, because it all falls to the bottom of the bag. I eat it because I bought it, and I do like the feel of popcorn between my teeth."
5,Zen of Popcorn,"This is simplicity itself. Doesn't leave a greasy taste in your mouth. Your palate doesn't feel overloaded with additives and salt. You taste popped corn at its core, at its essence. Highly recommended."
2,burns & only half pops,"I was looking for an alternative to buying a replacement air popper and found this product. However, and consistently, only half of the kernels pop in the recommended cooking time and most often some of the already popped corn comes out scorched. I thought it might just be my microwave but I brought a bag over to a friends house and same thing happened there as well. I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Very very bland,Pro: No trans fat. Con: No flavor. Basically tastes like cardboard. My children won't eat it.
1,Popcorn without any flavor!,"I'm sure this is the healthiest popcorn there is, however there are a lot of healthy items that are not appetizing. Popcorn was always a bit of a treat, this is not. It's very close to the taste of card board, even adding salt or butter does not seem to help.the kernels are dry and spongy. forget about getting any kids to eat this, they would rather eat sardine crackers."
3,Nice little book,"Another book about Elvis Presley and this book isn't the definitive biography on this subject! But it is a nice and objective book which reviews Elvis' career and contains lots of nice photographs, although most Elvis fans will already have them. The story itself is objective, contains hardly any prejudices and gets rid of Albert Goldman's book ""Elvis"". The book contains a list with all US singles and albums and also an index. A nice book for anyone who isn't an Elvis-fan but who wants to know the main things about Elvis, for the die-hard Elvis-fan this book contains no new information."
3,"Efficient, very easy to clean, but plastic can break!","After three months of household use, I decided to downwardly revise my original review because a large piece of plastic suddenly broke off the feed chute during use, making the machine unusable.There is a 12 month warranty with Panasonic and I am returning the clear top piece for replacement. Still, this should not have happened during normal use and I am wondering if it might indicate a design problem.Based on other reviews, I am planning to purchase the Stainless Steel Waring Juicer, also sold through Amazon."
2,Makes something captivating boring....,"This is another one of those frustrating reads. It has such potential, it's appeal is universal, it relates directly to the human experience, and yet it ends up being an exercise in academic self-gratification.The sentences are extraordinarily dense, and the language used is so esoteric, that the layperson will find themselves re-reading passages and consulting dictionaries to the point of utter frustration.In the end one is left with the impression that the author is more concerned with demonstarting an arcane knowledge of sociological concepts than with providing a truly readable, worthwhile, and ultimately human exploration of a fascinating and important topic."
3,Tammy remembered,"This was a hard cd to find. Thanks to Amazon, I bought this for my wife. I don't care for hillbilly music, but my wife does. If you're a Tammy fan, buy it and enjoy"
3,Only 2 songs are worth the purchase,There are only two songs to buy this cd for Elton Johns version of Stand by your Man and Wynonna's Woman to Woman..... The others can do NO justice to Tammy's recordings.
4,If Elton John wasn't on it I would give it 5 stars.,"So many people could have sung Stand By Your Man the way it is supposed to be sung. I don't know why anybody let Elton John do this. I actually have the album and love it, I just skip over Elton John, but I wish I didn't have to because I really love that song."
3,Fair,The best was Elton John's rendition of Stand By Your Man. Every one else needs to get some emotion into this CD. I bought it because Elton contributed and this is the only reason I'm happy I did. Judy
4,A Last Song by the FIRST LADY,"There are some creative interpretation of Tammy Wynette classics included in this tribute package, but the best reason for adding this to your collection to hear the haunting yet sweet sound of Tammy Wynettes' last recorded song, ""IN MY ROOM"". This one song, filled with all the emotion and breath taking vocal melancholy that Wynette was famous for, makes the price of admission to this tribute well worth it!"
3,Nobody Can Replace Tammy!,"I gave this album 3 stars because there are three songs on it that are touching and magnificiently done (including one done by Tammy herself). The others, however, leave something to be desired. I don't know who sings ""Apartment #9"" on this album, but whoever she is, she ruins one of Tammy's greatest songs. Also, Elton John's version of ""Stand By Your Man"" is an insult to the great lady. I once saw an interview in which Tammy said something to the effect of, ""if a man insists on singing that song, he should at least say, 'it MUST be hard to be a woman.'"" Sadly, Elton didn't take her advice. Most of these songs are poor arrangments of originally wonderful songs. If you love Tammy, let me suggest my personal favorite albums, ""Next to You"" and ""Higher Ground."""
3,"Ok, but certainly not the best.","Too much Paige and Phoebe, not enough Piper. The ending was a little abrupt as well."
4,Favourite!,"I read this book a few years ago so I don't know if I would feel the same way now, but this was by far my favourite charmed book. It had an awesome plot, and it was much scarier than the other ones and more mature than the others. I loved this book, it was fantastic!"
4,I Love It!,"I love this book! Anyone who enjoys charmed will love this book! Even if you dont like charmed and just like mystery or si-fi will enjoy this fun filled mystery! It has everything a book could have! including, romance, young romance, action, comedy, and is even kind of a thriller! The only problem I had with this book is that it can get a little confusing in parts. Somtimes I can't figure out were they are, who is talking and whats is going on! Over all I deffenatly think everyone should read this book! I love it!"
5,Excellent!,"I would highly recommend this book. The author does such a wonderful job writing it, that is doesn't feel like a Charmed book, because it has so much more depth to the story. It doesn't focus solely on The Charmed Ones, in that there are chapters where a great deal of events occur without the Charmed Ones being present. It reads like a really great mystery novel, and it had me guessing about where it was going. All around this book was very entertaining. Much better than some of the other Charmed books. Well worth it!"
2,paige paige paige,"i admit that paiges character has to be set but in the first few books she's in it's all you here about, plus prue is hardly mentioned like pheobe and piper have just forgotten about her even though in this book pheobe does prue prebooked photo assiment she's hardly talked about. plus with this book there is no major battle as a big charmed fan i found this book dissapointing"
1,NOT FOR SERIOUS FANS OF OPERA,"Please! Mario Lanza never sang on the big stages of the world. This book tries to make him out as if he did, which is bogus. This is sophomoric stuff. You just can't take it seriously.Pavarotti and Domingo as pretenders and Mario Lanza, cheesy films to boot, the champion? Please! We New Yorkers know better than that!"
1,far from a definitive or even well-written biography,"This book is hardly ""definitive"" and not even well written with a style that loves the sensationalist but hardly factual. Mario Lanza was a tenor although not an opera singer as he only sang in one production early in career. As such, the biographer needs to know something about music and tenors. By his remarks, Armando Cesari clearly knows little or nothing about music. On page 22, he disputes the comment of Boris Goldowski (an opera authority of long standing) that Lanza didn't have the musical ability to learn the tenor part in the Beethoven 9th so he taught him the role of Fenton instead. Cesari then says he disputes that because of length and ""not very diffilcult"". Really? Those are two very different styles, Beethoven and Nicolai,and if Mr. Cesari doesn't know that then he has no business writing about music or singing. The rest of the book reads like sensationalist yellow journalism, something from The National Enquirer. Avoid it."
5,Best Lanza biography!,"This is the Lanza biography I waited years for. Very well researched & written. It works on all levels, emotional, intellectual & musical! It is by far the best biography dealing with Mario Lanza the Artist. Highly recommended!!! The free cd of fantastic live & rare Mario Lanza performances is a wonderful bonus!"
4,Good reading,"Tells the story of one of the greatest tenors. After reading, you will want to watch some of Mr. Lanza's movies and listen to the CD that is included with the book. The book is good, although I believe the author let feelings of anger or disappointment with some who might have been 'hangers-on' affect his characterizations of them. Well-organized and well-researched. The large collection of photos is tremendous."
3,very durable except . . .,"This product is all metal and very durable. The end must be unscrewed and screwed back down every time you need to extend the chalk. This can be somewhat annoying when you are trying to lecture as it slows up your pace when writing notes on the board. Now I use them for my colored chalk, which I use less frequently, and went back to my spring-activated chalk holder for white chalk."
5,Perfect Gift For Favorite Teacher,"One thing I hate about using chalk is the residue on my hands, especially when you use colored chalk to emphathize certain items. I went for this item because the plastic holders my school provides break if you look at them wrong. These holders are absolutely outstanding!!! No residue, easy to use. Durable. I have no worrys about using them. To top it off, it gives me an added professional appearance to my daily presentations. I highly recommend you buy this. Better yet, if you are looking to get something for that favorite teacher, this is a great low-cost item that I am sure most teachers don't even think about getting for themselves. Buy it!!!!"
4,"Doesn't hold 40 lbs, but it like it anyway","My dog's food comes in 20 lb. bags, and since I read the reviews for the 40 and 20 lb. versions, I bought this one. All the food fits in with room to spare, so I'd say it holds 25-28 lbs. of food. Regular hard plastic food containers are so much more expensive and this one fits my needs for a better price. The liner is a nice touch, but I don't know how much you'd really need to wash it.... the plastic it's made of is slightly thicker than a freezer bag material. It is smaller than advertised, but all in all, I like it."
1,Don't Buy - Not as advertised,"I just received this today and am returning the item today.I bought this based on the description that 1) it would allow me to put in my 40 pounds of dog food and because I could more easily see into the bin than the dark brown paper bag that sits in my garage. I also bought it because 2) I liked the idea of a washable liner.To begin with, this item would fit a 20 pound bag; there is no way 40 pounds would fit in the bin. As for washable liner? I thought maybe the material would be something like the material used for a thick windbreaker; it is not. It is plastic and about the same thickness as the plastic lining of a Hills Science Diet 40 pound bag of dog food. So yes, it is washable in the way you could wash out a thicker Hefty brand garbage bag, but you would not be able to throw that in the washing machine either without it coming out unuseable either."
5,county dancing,excellent tap we learn a lot from it. Will buy again when we need more lessons. Amazon was on top of everything and it was in excellent condition when it arrived Thanks everyone.
5,Nothing but the good stuff,"There's no filler here, just one great song after another. Particularly remarkable is Winifred Horan's consistently lovely fiddling -- what a beautiful, rich tone! Her song, The Highlands of Holland (good title!), has a klezmer-like sweetness and bounce that keeps me coming back to it."
2,My least favorite Solas album,"Considering that ""Solas"" means light, ""Dorchadas"" (darkness) would be a better name for this album. The energy, passion, variety and virtuosity of earlier albums are almost completely absent here. Instead we get a series of almost indistinguishable, dirge-like songs with little or no Celtic flavor. This is a real downer of an album. If you haven't heard Solas before and want to check them out, skip this album and listen instead to the earlier ones, especially ""Sunny Spells and Scattered Showers."""
3,This book is OK,"This book goes through practical activities for infants and toddlers. It begins with a section on development and learning, and follows with simple activities to help develop emotional, social, cognitive, language, gross and fine motor skills. I thought it was a little oversimplified for professional use (I am a therapist), but it has some good ideas if you are a new parent or trying to set up a daycare/Sunday school/play group type of environment."
5,it works,"the scope cover fits over my eotech 552 pretty well. not too loose and not too tight. the top does leave an empty bulge, so its not as form fitting as you would expect. keeps the dust off of my lense, which is why i bought it. don't use it outdoors, its good to keep dust off indoors, but will just be a hassle outside."
5,What an amazing book,"This book was so inspirational. How God could use such a normal person in such a big way. Its really opened my eyes to the aspect on the ministry and how important they focus on souls, how much prayer and such just to do a crusade. It showed me that absoultly nothing is impossible with God. And just simple prayer works.I would so highly recommend this book."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BE DECEIVED!!,"While Benny Hinn may have started out with good intentions when he first came to meet the Lord it, sadly has come to the point where he preaches only about wealth and proparity and worse yet, portrays himself to be s ""god"" which SHOULD NOT be the message he should be sending; sure he throws in a ""salvation"" sermon every now and then and even when he does it isn't based off of scripture but his own twisted veiw of the Bible. Dear dear brothers and sisters...I urge you to stay away from teachings like this and instead go to the Word. God wants us to love HIM and NOT money!"
3,He Touched Me an Autobiography,Okay reading. I really understand how he achieved his status in the spiritual world. Glad to have read this book.
4,Good intro to the ministry of Benny Hinn,"As a new comer to Pastor Hinn's ministry I thought the book was uplifting and insightful as it chronicled his life to this point. However, if you are familar with the ministry this is merely a surface account of Pastor Hinn's life, lacking detailed theological analysis or viewpoint."
4,Good Value,"This is a really nice looking set. The comforter is starting to unravel and I can't imagine what will happen the next time I wash it. It was very cheap though, so what can you expect?"
1,Why? Why? Why?,"Nobody in their right mind should purchase this ""tribute album"".Why would you want to listen to the same songs done by a person with a lot lesser talent and the artistic skills of a chameleon. Buy the original! Norah Jones' name should not have been attached to this album. Somebody is just out trying to capitalize on her fame and talent."
1,Ugh,"Her original crap is horrific enough. Why in God's name would we need a tribute album? Puts you to sleep even more effectively than Norah's unoriginal lullabies. At the very least, they could've waited till her second album came out, but....even then...even...if....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.............."
3,A theorist's look at Party and Protest,"Party and protest is a comprehensive study of of two distinct subcultures: DiY Protest and Rave (party) cultures. Having a strong theoretical background in subculture theory (esp. the Birmingham school) I felt that this book has certain elements to offer the curious British subcultures student, but that the insider perspective causes some problems for the accountability of the essays. One would almost get the idea that McKay, while forming this anthology, was conscious of the relationship he has as a member of the academy versus the exclusive British subcultures. I would recommend this text as a study of DiY groups but one must keep in mind that the essays all seem to come from a nastalgic last-chance attempt at holding on to the ""good old days""."
4,Talking to Heaven,"Van Praagh's gift for sincerity, and his intent to help people heal their lives is evident in these accounts of messages he provides from ""the other side."" For the person who is new to this understanding of life after life, it can be both magical and reassuring. I wish there was more direction, though, in helping these restless spirits gain more peace and contentment.Spirit Journeys: Freeing the Soul in this Life and Beyond,Healing Thoughts: Applying Therapeutic Shamanism in Your Daily Life"
5,no doubt,I have no doubt what is in store for me after this life is done. I hope that someone like James is around for me so I can communicate with my loved ones when I am gone.
5,FROM SADNESS AND SORROW TO THE GREATEST FEELING OF PEACE.,"On January 18,1999 we lost our only brother whom we dearly love. Mr. Van Praagh's book helped us to understand not only the real meaning of life, but most of all the real meaning of death. We no longer grieve for him, but cherish the thought that someday we will all be together again. His book has taken the toughest time in our lives and turned it around to be the greatest time of healing, learning and understanding. This is a must read for anyone who has lost a loved one."
4,This book is a wonderful confirmation of Spirit,"This book is a wonderful confirmation of Spirit Van Praagh has the most incredible talent for revealing the subtle world of Spirit. After hearing his views on the Bible being the work of man - in order to maintain the populace in fear - I have to say that I am now going to reread the truly wonderful ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton, which now seems EVEN more real. Thank you Mr. Praagh for making Spirit even more tangible in our daily lives and thank you Mr. Patton for returning Jesus to the real world."
1,"Hated it! Where they are, I don't want to go! Boring!","When I ""pass over"" I sure don't want to go where they are----they bore me silly. They even bored the relatives who talked to them! Can't believe they could still be so trivial in 'death' as they probably were in life! Spare me!"
2,The New Age at its worst,"Pandering, hypocritical, assumptive nonsense. Take a look at Van Praagh's resume and it's pretty clear that he communicates with the dead, alright: mainly Benjamin, Grant, and Jackson. He classifies mediumistic talents, drawing on stuff that was discredited a hundred years ago, like apports and ectoplasmic voiceboxes. Gag. He even has the audacity to mention that ectoplasm sometimes ""looks like cheesecloth."" I guess because that's exactly what its been proven to be. After rehashing all the same Sylvia Browne bunk about vibratory rates and spiritual planes, he has the nerve to bash the Catholic Church for some 20 pages, concluding ""I still find it a bit unbelievable the Catholic Church teaches this stuff,"" and refers to Christianity as ""mythology."" Wow.Pass this one by, even if you are a spiritualist. Van Praagh is a cynical charlatan and frustrated screen-writer. The genre holds many more satisfying reads for just about any persuasion."
1,Are you buying this?,"I found this book patronizing and extremely difficult to believe. Van Praagh's words were simplistic, vague and shallow. The age-old art of giving people want you know they want to hear has not been lost in this book. It bothers me that grieving people will pay for such shamelessly peddled drivel."
5,Can you really talk to heaven?,"According to this book, YES you can talk to Heaven. Just not in the way most people think. I have no doubt there is a life after death, and i'd like to believe you can receive messages. There were alot of ""True stories"" in this book,My favorite 1 was about the dog. I find it fascinating that he can get messages from animals. That i would like to try myself..."
4,"His writing style is elementary, but I found it believable.","I found his writing style elementary, therefore distracting, but I loved the stories he told, and I believed them. Anyone who questions what death holds for us should read this book. However, James should withhold his comments on unrelated topics, and dispense with the trite cliches."
4,Truly a comfort to those in mourning,"I read this book after losing several people close to me. Some people dont know anyone close to them who had dies. I have known death all too well. At the time, I had lost my father who passed suddenly after heart surgery and then my best friends mother at the age of 48. It comforted me spiritually and emotionally and helped me accept what I wondered all my life. I enjoyed his storytelling and found myself nodding my head 'yes' through the whole thing. I couldnt wait to read more.I have enjoyed his show and interviews and believe that my angels are watching over me and my family, and that one day, I will see them again."
5,"Amazing, I would love to be able to talk to Mr. Praagh","This book helped me answer many questions I had relating to the death of my sister. Yet, I have many more. I know Mr. Praagh does seminars and sometimes personal meetings. I would like to know how to get in touch with him for I believe he could help myself and my family heal our broken hearts and answer some questions that need to be answered before we can go on. It has been almost 7 years since her death, and we still have no clues as to how it happened and who was involved. I need his help. My family needs his help."
4,Ease your fears of death,"In this book you will find that death is just another stage in life. We are all at different levels of learning and death isn't really as final as we use to think. Uplifting, and a great book. The comparisons of mediums and the specifics on seances was a little boring, but very interesting experiences by James Van Praagh"
2,Left me depressed,"Although I do believe in life after death, this book was very depressing. My sister died one year ago, and I hate to think of her just wandering around in a purposeless world. If you need help with the loss of someone, ""Embraced By the Light"" is a much better way to come to an understanding of death."
4,Very Good,I liked James Van Praagh's book Talking to Heaven along with Jenny Crawford's book - Through the Eyes of Spirit.Both mediums give out information and good explanation regarding life after-death.I must admit I have a large appetite for books written by such powerful mediums.Keep up the good work - James Van Praagh and Jenny Crawford.Bless you in your work.Margaret.
5,Enlightening!,"I have a few other of James Van Praagh books and this is my favorite. If you are looking for a way to connect with your inner self, this book gives you step by step instructions. I can't wait to learn the art of meditation so I too can connect with spirit. This book was recommended by a friend of mine that is a Medium."
5,WOW,I chose this rating for I like just about any thing that James Van Praagh writes about. He is so honest an sincere bout his writings. Since I have read his books with another woman who does same thing it has changed my mind on not being afraid to die for now I know what to expect. This book helps you to understand how to fine your love ones an guilds on the other side. Even though I was one reading it I could swear I could here him reading it to me it is that good. I have already told everyone I know to read this book if they have any fears of death or the bout the other side an they will have no more fears.
1,Don't waste your time!,"We are spiritual beings having a human experience. We therefore have a natural desire to find our ""true home."" Unfortunately, reading this book will send you down the wrong path. There is but one ""highway to Heaven."" Read about it in Isaiah 35...and the book of John. Don't waste your time talking to demons in the form of so-called ""dead people."" Life is too short, and your eternal destiny is at stake."
1,Read instead,"I strongly recommend ""Why People Believe Wierd Things"" by scientist, Michael Shermer. He exposes these ""mediums"" and will open alot of people's eyes. Very educational."
2,Very sketchy account of the after life,"I read the book with sceptiscm, and still do not believe that we repeatedly revisit the earth or how we can recognize our lost ones in spirit form, and found the whole thing pointless and with no direction. Why are we here?? why can't we get the message!!!!"
4,Best First Book on Life after Death,"This little book was clearly and simply written about the subject, which is life of a medium. I have been reading mediphysical material for 25 yrs. and the information can get overwhelming in most books. This one is written like a guide and would be a wonderful first book on the subject."
2,Another Creepy Book!!!,"I read James Van Praagh's book over the weekend, it was interesting if you are looking or something to entertain you. I do believe that there exists a life after death and that there is a spiritual realm that we can not see or hear, but I think that it is demons or ""familiar spirits"" and not our deceased loved ones. I mean if someone closed to me passed away and wanted to talk to me, why would I have to pay someone $200 or more for us to communicate? If this is my loved one I should be able to hear them myself right? And if we keep on living and doing things as normal, well then what's the point of dying anyway?"
3,"1 chronicles 10:13,14","Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord; he did not keep the word of the Lord and even consulted a medium for guidance, and did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse."
1,"Ah hem, excuse me, sir/madam","May I humbly recommend the DVD ""Bullsh*t: The Complete First Season"", starring Penn & Teller, available at amazon.com, as a rather hilarious alternative to this fraudulent work. Episodes One and Twelve are especially pertinent in this regard."
1,"Skip this and Read ""Eagle and Rose"" by Altea instead.","""The Eagle and the Rose"" is the best of this genre of true stories on paranormal experiences. Van Praagh's novel is poorly written and skimpy on details. Read Altea's book instead and you'll be well rewarded."
2,talking to the heavens,very intense and hard to read and keep in tune with for me. like Rosemary Altea much much better !!
4,A very helpful understanding.,I attended a seminar and purchased the book there. It is very interesting and worth reading.
5,Great reading!,"Reading TALKING TO HEAVEN has made me more aware of what heaven is really like. James Van Praagh has opened the door to a new way of thinking of an old philosophy. Definately an insightful way of understanding the next realm. Also a must read is THROUGH THE EYES OF SPIRIT by Jenny Crawford, as with James Van Praagh's book, Jenny's insight with the spirit world brings forth clarity of the here-after. What wonderful reading and comfort these books bring."
4,Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker,"Although this is my third Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker, I am very happy with it's features. I like the separate yeast dispenser, I like the choices in loaf size and crust color. I also feel it is quite forgiving if you are not perfectly accurate with your measurements. The main problem is the motor burns out after awhile; but, I do use it often, almost daily. My son once used it to make pizza dough (as he OFTEN did) and set it too close to the countertop edge. The machine fell to the floor but kept on working. It was the motor that eventually died."
1,Disappointed,"I picked this machine because of the shape and 3 lb. loaf option. My first attempt to make bread was a 1 lb loaf to test the crust color. I've read some issues regarding the settings not working properly on some machines. So I was going to make a test loaf. The beaters mixed the ingredience just fine untill it formed a ball of dough. Once the machine found resistence, it started to grind. Sounded like the gears were striping. I am returning it to Amazon. So far no problems there. I will try another Panasonic SD-YD250, I'm hoping it was a fluke. Sometimes that happens."
4,Makes great loaves,"This breadmaker makes consistently great loaves of bread and the white bread recipe that comes with the breadmaker is fantastic. One reason that I gave it only 4 stars is that when making raisin bread, and you add the raisins at the proper time, the kneading process will tend to eject a few raisins onto the heating element and when it starts to bake, it'll smoke like crazy. Definitely not a good thing when you live in a dorm like I do with a smoke dector in each room, and having it go off will evacuate the entire dorm. Luckily for me I caught it in time."
2,not worth purchasing.,"can't believe all these rave reviews. yes, it's quiet and has a non-stick interior surface, but after 6 tries i have yet to get a great loaf of bread. most of them are small hard lumps of cooked dough (and yes, the yeast i use is fresh and of the kind they recommend). the latest few loaves keep getting too dark, with parts even being burnt. the only setting that makes a remotely edible loaf is the sandwich mode.i have been making bread by hand and thought this would make things so much easier. i'll admit it is easier than making bread by hand from scratch, but is it too much to ask for a breadmaker that actually makes a nice loaf of bread? because this one certainly isn't it."
1,Do not WASTE your return shipping!!!!!,"I just took this out of the box and right away could see that it was not going to work. The motor part that turns the pan is plastic. The pan does not fit onto the plastic piece. The pan just sits there with a lot of play back and forth. The worst of it, the dough hook does not fit securely onto the knob in the pan. I had my last breadmaker for 8 years, and if not for the part my husband washed down the sink I would still be using it. This product is not worth carrying home."
5,"At $120, this has been a great bread maker","I bought this, my first bread maker, in May 2010 (21 months ago), and have used it for two or three loaves per week.The only times I have been disappointed with a result were when I made a mistake (don't leave the yeast out!) or just got too experimental. I really like to try different things and sometimes get the balance wrong. This can result in less rising than expected.It's very easy to use, the results are super, and I also make loaves for my friends for fun.The price has risen a lot since I bought it at $120, so maybe you should look for alternatives."
5,Awesome bread!,"This is our first bread machine and happily this model makes terrific bread! Have made whole wheat, pizza dough, white, anadama and white in various loaf sizes. All have come out delicious with a nicely browned, crispy crust. The dough paddle is short and slim so while it does leave a hole in the bottom of the loaf it doesn't really mar the loaf all that much. Love how you just toss in the ingredients and voila - its done. The machine does make a little bit of noise, some mixing sounds as it moves thru the cycles but probably get that with any machine. Only minor complaint is that controls are not as intuitive as I expected. Expect to read step by step thru the manual the first few times to learn how to run it well. But that's likely more revealing about me than the machine!! I definitely would recommend this model."
2,Didn't kneed whole wheat flour well,"I was very disappointed. The Panasonic made a good loaf of bread when I used mostly white flour, but when I tried to make a whole wheat bread with buttermilk that I'd make many times with a Hitachi machine that had given out, the bread came out as 2 inedible lumps. I tried it again - same thing. On another bread (white flour with chocolate chips), the crust was burned and the chips were all at one end. (I'd set it on light crust.) Also, the manual has errors and, as some previous reviewers have written, the monitor is hard to view. I was very impressed with Amazon, however. I got a full refund."
4,Recommended with Reservations,"I bought this breadmaker after my old one (Breadman) fritzed out. This one works well so far. I've made a couple of loaves with it. The machine is quiet and doesn't vibrate and wobble like the Breadman.I wish it were a little shorter so it would fit better on my counter. I have lights under the upper cabinets and had a difficult time finding a place where it would fit. I have found it a bit complicated figuring out the settings, because I think there is an error in the book, but I have muddled through. One other thing I dislike is the ""rest"" cycle, as it extends the time required to make a loaf. I understand the need if someone puts in cold ingredients, but I don't do that. I would have given it 5 stars if it were easier to figure out the directions for setting the options."
5,I did a good deal,"After I moved in the Hawaii Island, I noticed everything is very expensive including some bread. Also I have to do long drive to get it. I decided the purchase a bread making machine and check around. This machine has the place for east , so the east will automatically drop into the bread. Also there are many different function, but it is easy to use. The best thing is easy to clean. The bread is as good as one I can buy at a store. I also enjoyed making pizza dough. I just need to wash one pan inside the machine and there is no dough stack it. I can make dough without mess the kitchen or my hand. I will try to make other kind of bread from now on. There is timer system too. I am so glad I chose this Panasonic one."
4,"Great Bread, Easy to Use, Manual Needs Help","This is my first bread machine,and the bread tastes every bit as good as ""by hand."" The machine is very easy to use, and cleans well. I like the numerous options and the feature that allows short power interrupts. The only glitch is the manual. We had thrown the box away, and I could not remember what sizes M, L, XL were after several months. The sizes are nowhere in the manual! Furthermore, other reviewers noted that the measurements in the recipes are very awkward because they use ounces, not cups. We ended up buying a book of recipes--much needed with this machine. We're buying a machine for a friend's wedding gift--and are getting the Breadman machine instead of the Panasonic so she can use it without having to go buy a cookbook or fancy cooking scale to use it."
3,"It's ok, but can be better","This product works ok in general. One problem I have is that it seems to be over cooking. The breads' crust is thick and hard, even with the light crust option."
4,Panasonic Bread Machine,I agree with others who say this is an easy machine to use. My only complaint is that I cannot read the display very well because of the size and the contrast (and my need for reading glasses).
1,don't buy,"I've owned this for less than 2 months, It's worked great very easy to use. Now i have an issue the key pad does not work at all so i called Panasonic who were very polite and quickly answered. It would be fine if i lived in Virginia Beach so i could carry it in for service, instead i can mail 500 miles and pay shipping both ways. According to Panasonic , even if their product is defective I pay shipping both ways. WHAT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I'LL BUY MORE PANASONIC PRODUCTS."
4,A solid machine,"After much research I purchased the Panasonic. I noted some people had trouble with what (I can only guess) must have been defective machines. I have now made three different types of loaves, all turned out great.The biggest challenge was whole wheat, where I found the dough needed more water than called for in the recipe. Too little water with a dense loaf such as whole wheat clearly strained the motor and made for ineffective mixing until fixed.I find the timer convenient and easy to use and programming likewise fairly easy. While a glass cover or window would be nice, its easy to peek inside anyway. Overall, seems to be a well constructed machine that is fairly quiet. I would recommend it."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I bought after going through a lot of reviews too.It burns the bread, it cooks for about 10 - 12 minutes too long. I set it to the lightest crust, the smallest size loaf, etc, but it burns the crust black. I have learned this now and have to set a timer to stop the cooking process early and take it out. It also squeaks annoying when it is mixing.If there is a way to adjust the heat or cooking time, please let me know. Right now I can only make bread if I am here to rescue it before it burns the outside crust.For the money, I am disappointed. I guess I just have a lemon, but I already threw the box out so cannot return it now or I would have. I am sure other people have good models, mine just is not one of them.It's also pretty big on the counter, far larger than my old model. On the plus side, the bread does slide out the pan easily enough in one piece."
4,Great breakmaker - poor instructions,I've used this to make bread 2 or 3 times a week for 6 months and I'm very happy with the results. You do have to read and re-read and follow the instructions several times to figure out what they are on about... the recipe section in particular lacks a clear description of how to set the machine for each recipe.
5,A great machine,"I've had this bread maker for several months. My family makes 2-3 loaves a week and have stopped buying bread. There have been two failures, but appear to have been human error. Otherwise we have had consistently good results.We have made basic white, wheat and anadama recipes, all were good. The timer option is really nice. Ingredients can be placed in the machine at bedtime and the timer will start the baking process so that the bread is read for breakfast. Waking up to the smell of baking bread is a nice treat.I was skeptical due to poor performance of a bread machine in 10-15 years ago. Technology has come a long way."
5,Best Bread Machine For a Busy Life,I received this bread machine as a gift and I have had it almost 6 months now. I use it a couple of times a week. The recipes in the book are delicious and very easy to make. I love the easy menu on the machine and the options for faster loaves. The yeast auto-add option is great because I can put the ingredients in and get on with my day and not worry about timing the yeast. The only downside to this machine is cleaning the paddle. It's hard to find something small enough to clean the inside of the paddle but I love this bread machine too much so it is only a small negative.
