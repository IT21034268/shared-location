1,Yuck!,Congratulations to all those involved in making this piece of trash. I was offended and that's hard to do.
1,The filthiest movie of the cinema!,"Pink Flamingos was the first film of John Waters which went over all the underground circuits. But his career has nothing to do with Jonas Mekas, Ron Rice, Lionel Rogosin or Jim Jarmush. Water is absolutely unworried about the form; but engaged with unhealthy tendencies of the human being.The aberrant competence is established between Divine and the Marbles. The main guests (in this beloved cult movie among whom I don' t belong) are perversion, coprology, torture, blood, overweight and visual aggressions that conform an obscure journey through an awesome exhibitionism.As accurately Danny Peary states, that weird fascination by blood, meanness and pain around the camera would seem to delight itself may be suspicious of fascism.If you have an iron stomach, watch it. If you don `t, abstain yourself."
3,"It Is What It Is, Accept It","This movie promises to shock and offend, and it certainly does...The problem is, it only does this on the first viewing. After that, it is quite a boring affair.After reading many of the negative reviews here, however, I now truely realize how offending this movie can be to people with ""morals"" (ha ha!) Mr. Waters, mission accomplished."
4,"A filthy butt-bongo fiesta, a cover-your-eyes gag-athon!!","A stomach-churning, slime-covered jewel from the chest of a demented master is ""Pink Flamingos"". Ooh-mow-mow indeed. I spent a lot of time viewing this magnum opus with my head turned away, only to glance back to be assaulted by yet more FILTH! And I mean that in a positive way. Could you imagine eating food that had been stored in that rancid trailer? Can you imagine how Divine's character must have smelled? White-trash has always fascinated me, and this more than exceeded my vilest expectations."
5,Classic movie,"I am a fan of John Water's movies and have waited a long time to get a copy of Pink Flamingos. This is an over the edge, funny and entertaining movie with some spice added (imagine that with Divine). I am so happy that I now have Pink Flamingos to add to my John Water's collection. The quality of the movie was excellent. Highly recommend purchasing this movie if you like unique entertainment with a side of raunch."
3,Movie,This movie is hard to find around here so Amazon rocks! This is one of the sickest movies ever but its awesomely bad! Its John Waters at his best & im so happy with my purchase! This is one of those movies that you have to see it to understand. Its great & gross all at once!!!
3,Casual sex story...,"It is a very strange pre-sex-revolution movie of murdering mixed with sex, variety of sexual practices have been touched and screened in a comedic manner, issues were dramatic and beyond the law usually.Also good fights evil the question of what is good still remains open to a reviewer."
4,Hm...,"NEVER watch this movie alone, or in a small group. IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WHEN VIEWED IN A LARGE GROUP! There is so many things that make you say, ""ah, I really didnt want to see this,"" that you will never make it through the film. However, if you can manage to see it on the big screen in a room full of 100 people, go for it. It then becomes an experience, and while the gross scenes are not any less gross, they do become more funny. The best way to describe my reaction to the film is I was cracking up more then I have at almost any other film; there were tears in my eyes. However, while doing so, I was not able to look at the screen because I just couldn't watch.That said, if you're not able to get past the... well, let's call them speed bumps... then you will not enjoy the film. In other words, dont take anything you see to heart. It's a film, be grossed out then forget about it when the next scene starts."
3,"Not particularly funny, ultimately depressing","Having heard John Waters interviewed several times (there is one included on this DVD), I find him intelligent and like him yet am unable to enjoy most of his films. The sad fact is that they fail the ultimate test for any comedy -- they simply are not funny.""Pink Flamingos"" is the worst of the bunch. Is it outrageous? Yes. Is it funny? No.It has, however, become an American classic of sorts, so you probably should see it once and judge for yourself. But rent it."
1,EWW,"I thank God every day that I don't have humor like this. I watched 5 minutes in total and utter horror as a very beautiful, but large man stuffed an equally beuatiful piece of veal up his dress in order to shop-lift it. Pecker was hilarious and very touching...this was well...unbelievable."
1,HOW I WISH I HADN'T SEEN THIS!,"A WOMAN SCREAMING AS SHE'S BEING BRUTALLY RAPED WITH A LIVE CHICKEN BY A MANSONESQUE LUNATIC. HOW CAN ANYONE USE THE WORD ""FUNNY"" TO DESCRIBE THE TORTURE OF A POOR ANIMAL STRUGGLING IN VAIN TO FREE ITSELF BEFORE IT'S BEATEN TO DEATH? POLYESTER WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE WATCHING IT, OR ANYTHING ELSE BY WATERS AGAIN."
3,treads the fine line between annoyance and hilarity,"""Pink Flamingos"" is John Waters' plotless and pointless debut film, a low-budget junker that's developed a deserving cult following. While I'm not as enthusiastic about this RHPS-style movie as most people, I do think it sets the bar high for grossing out & offending people, and clearly had an influence on modern-day pranksters like the Farrelly brothers and the ""South Park"" team. At first, the concept of watching rednecks in their natural habitat is funny (the chicken-sex scene had me cringing and laughing), but after a while, the movie's shock techniques start to wear out, partly because Divine (in addition to being a horrible actress? actor?) is such an annoying, grotesque presence. I realize it may have been Waters' goal to glamorize this nasal pig, but 108 minutes of her shtick is enough to drive anyone up the wall. But even with her, ""Pink Flamingos"" has some of the most unique, shocking comedy bits ever put on celluloid, so I recommend it."
2,Get real!,"I must admit I find all these five star reviews a bit disturbing.Yes, this movie is funny, and worth a look if only for cultural reasons. But great art it isn't - not even close.So save the five stars for more significant achievements in cinema and leave this one on the midnight circuit where it belongs."
1,Not shocking or daring - just infantile,"The worst part of this is the wanton cruelty to animals - if you want to watch a chicken slowly throttled/bludgeoned to death for the sake of pubescent humor, this is for you. Divine later became an animal rights advocate, so she must have been as horrified by this movie in retrospect as any animal lover would be."
4,The art of trash?,"One of the reviewers wrote that ""Pink Flamingos"" does not hold any values or morals and that its audience reflects the characters in the movie. However, the fact of the matter is that this film does hold moral standards and it only rebels against them on a micro level. No matter how offensive and disgusting this movie is it still has limits and thus falls short from being great. Still, I would definitely recommend it for those who like cult films, but if you are looking for truly anarchistic and challenging movies try getting one of the Pasolini's or Makavejev's films."
4,It is what it is,"I'll just tell you straight forward, this isn't an amazing movie. It's not even a good movie. It doesn't try to be either of those. What it IS, is a movie with unsimulated oral sex between a mother and son (the characters, not in real life as plenty of the rest of this movie is), an obese woman constantly covered in eggs, a sex scene with a live chicken, and of course, a fat transvestite chewing on actual dog poo. if you don't like one or all of those things, I suggest not watching this movie. What's the point of angering yourself? If you don't mind seeing any of that stuff in a movie (it didn't bother me), then you'll probably see the movie for what it was intended to be, offensively and darkly funny."
5,for those who enjoy being over the edge,"this movie is perfecet for people who have a wild, wierd or crazy side. it's very strange, funny and gros. not recommended for your grandma!(unless she's a nut)"
4,Disgustingly and perversely interesting,"What goes on in this movie is crude, yet one is drawn to it like a car crash. The acting is of a poor quality and reminds me of the people on Jerry Springer. Sometimes the plot is slow moving, but then something happens to keep you from shutting it off."
5,This is one reason that people think Baltimore is messed up!,"Pink Flamingos put John Waters and Devine on the map. If you can get past the first three minutes of the film, with the mentally disabled mother talking about needing eggs, you will be sucked in. This movie has nearly ever taboo topic thrown in, from incest, to bestality, to drug use (poppers), to eating dog crap, to transvestites. The list can go on and on and on. This movie is meant to shock you. It makes fringe people look mainstream. This is the charm of Pink Flamingos."
4,Now this is a classic,"screw all the family-orientated garbage that is tainting movie theatres nowadays. does anyone want to see another tom hanks and meg ryan duo? does anyone really care if julia roberts plays the kindhearted hooker a second time? this movie is my favorite of the legendary john waters collection. the man's a genius! he's the master of good bad taste. dyed pubes, beastality, incest, furniture licking, egg obsession, and probably the most unforgettable final scene of all time...this movie's excellent, and always has me laughing and turns my stomach a little. just don't watch it while eating or drinking anything."
3,"Disgusting, so disgusting its good","Not much to say but that it is extremely low budget, freaky, disgusting, crude, vile and repulsive. You must have a very open mind and be able to watch all types of movies cause this movie by far is not for everyone, thats a fact.Its very wierd and twisted, so please b4 you buy this understand what kind of movie it is and no what your getting and its a low budget flick that is just something you have never seen b4. Its quit shocking in such a funny gross way."
5,Sickest of the Sick,"I saw it back in 1973 and the whole cast was on stage @ University of Maryland...the movie is the essence of disgusting perversion. Highly entertaining, but I wouldn't have eaten that steak...the movie does push the boundaries of grossness. See it & laugh!!"
5,pink flamingos,every time you see a small single wide trailer you will think of this film.THANKS JOHN.
1,John Waters sure has come a long way...,"I saw Pecker a few months ago and loved it, and then I saw John Waters at the Independent Spirit Awards and thought he ruled, so I decided to take a look at some of his older stuff. It seems to me that Mr. Waters just felt like making an extremely disturbing movie with all his sick hippie friends back in the early 70's. Anyone who enjoys this movie is perversely demented with extreme mental problems. This deserves a MUCH more harsh rating than NC-17. Showgirls and Orgazmo are family movies compared to this. I'd had trouble digesting food ever since I watched the scene with the guy doing tricks with his colon."
1,Extra software needed for this video!,"Beware that this video needs to run InterActual for you to view the media. This software data mines your computer for additional information that it sells. The video will not play without a connection to the internet.You know I am on the internet now typing this, but when I am at home in rural WY I do not have an internet connection and I can not watch this video even thought I paid for a copy.Yes it's a great movie, but I can not watch it. I should have been warned about this before I purchased it. Now I need to spend another $14.95 to buy the InterActual player that I do not need for anything other than this video."
1,Not enough beer in the world to make this stinker palatable,A Jr. College class of deviants could have come up with a better film. As a matter of fact I HAVE seen better film on a bathtub.
5,Living History,"My dad had a scratched, old 45 single with ""Jailhouse Now"" and ""Muleskinner Blues"" which we used to listen to in the early '60s. Jimmie's music evokes the smell of Camel cigarettes, bacon frying, the warmth of standing in front of a fireplace, and lively games of checkers played as a child.Listen, and times long past will live again."
3,classsic folk music,"This cd of original folk music set the standard for today's lyrics and inovative music. It finds roots in hill, country and folk music."
5,Another page turner. A Must read. Also Educational.,"When you read this book, you will live scenes from the lives of the extremely rich Arab and the extremely poor Arab, the very opressed Arab and the totally liberal Arab. You will cry for the heavy human suffering and you will rise with the genuine call for peace, but above all, you will know what it means to live your life in search of your identity as a woman and as a Palestinian. Very insightful, educational and very well written."
5,Blame it on the Dog,"Where are these guys? Great musical talent, some say this album is kind of pop. I say, if you like Elvis Costello, Dwight Yoakum, etc. you'll like these guys and I think they are pretty good songWRITERS too."
5,Strong music for today tied to the roots of rock & country!!,"Well, first there was a catchy video with a pretty ""interesting"" song...""Back on the Farm"". I bought ""Blame it on the Dog"" on the strength of that song and just fell in love with strong vocals, early rock-n-roll feel infused with real country musicianship and the fun that Andy, Matt and Mike bring to their playing. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to honesty in the music they enjoy as well as for anyone who likes to have fun and enjoy the music. I'm anxiously awaiting the next CD from this amazingly talented trio. I've now ordered their ""Cows on Main Street"" CD and after hearing the audio clips for it, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."
5,Powerful!,"All of M.H. material is great, however, Do it All contains Michael's best vocal skills. The bass playing is good too. You won't be disappointed!"
3,2nd print of tpb a minor improvement,"The 2nd print is very close, but no cigar. After the computer coloring hack job of the first print, Marvel redid some of the issues, as there were originally printed 30 years ago. Unfortunately, there are still some pages, here and there, that still have this bad coloring work. On top of it, I now see some colored pages from the 80's special edition reprints making it an inconsistent mess.Hopefully by the time Marvel releases the 3rd print, ALL of the coloring for this collection will be brought back to its former glory."
2,More color complaints,"Seriously, what were they thinking when they gave the coloring job on this the green light? For those who love great artwork in comics, this short run by Neal Adams on X-Men in the late 60's is really one of the highlights. So why would Marvel treat it so poorly? One reviewer mentioned the previous print job as being worse but I disagree. This is a mess; costumes change color from page to page, some pages are flat, saturated color while others are dot printed (which looks far worse on high grade paper than on newsprint!). I also hope they give this a third, improved printing. For those of you who can't wait, the great artwork is still there, it's just buried under an inept rush-job. Personally, I would've prefered the thing in b&w."
5,Essential X-men stories in one fine collection,"One of the finest runs in the Silver Age of comics were the X-men stories by Roy Thomas and Neal Adams which have been collected here in it's entirety in a single softcover volume. These stories introduced new characters and costumes and featured the stunning artwork of Neal Adams in his first work for Marvel Comics. Neal Adams experimented with storytelling and graphics which have yet to be surpassed on this series. The highlight of the series was the sequence in the Savage Land where the villainous Sauron was introduced and the X-men's arch nemesis, Magneto, was surprisingly reintroduced. The X-men are joined by Ka-Zar and Zabu in their battle with Magneto's minions. The only complaint I have with this package is the recoloring of the stories. I would have preferred to see the original coloring preserved and perhaps enhanced but not completely redone. Altogether it is a breathtaking volume which is a must for every X-men fan and collector."
3,the reprinted artwork was a letdown,The Good: the stories are all nicely done and this collection makes for some entertaining reading.The Bad: The coloring takes a lot away from the artwork and on a certain pages even makes it look mediocre. I have a looked at Neal Adams' penciling in b/w art and it is fantastic! I don't know whether this was exactly how the original issues looked or if the coloring is a problem only in this edition. I wish Marvel had done a more professional job on the coloring...
4,Great on data and pictures - maps are sorely lacking,"American Shortline Railway Guide is a great help for any train buff. Over 500 short lines are described: history, current status, number of engines (some lines with full listing), cars, as well as address of owner and radio frequencies. I especially liked the many pictures accompanying the text. There is really one drawback only: The book does not contain any maps. You will need a train atlas or a Rand Mc Nally on the side, unfortunately. Other interesting details are lists of abandoned and non-operating lines as well as addresses of ownerships companies. A must-have for US train buffs, especially in conjunction with the Train-Watchers Guide to North American Railroads (also by George W. Drury)."
3,Black-N-White Pix; 1955??,"if a train watcher of any kind you need this book but the black and white pix, or lack of many pix as well as lack of any maps at all shows a distinct lack of effort by Kalmbach; very dissappointing"
5,Who am I? ... I don't know.,"As an American Jew and journalist, Thomas Friedman showed brillance in analyzing American & Israeli Jews' identity problem and Middle Eastern politics. Some people may dislike this book for some political reasons. But this book will greatly help you to understand not only changes in Middle Eastern politics but also changes in world politics.For me, his analysis on the confusion of identity of Jewish people is especially touching. Though I have no Jewish blood in my vein, I can understand that kind of confusion. The truth of national identity is missing. Politics dictates us how to see ourselves. And when politics is in confusion, we really don't know who we are. The request for normalcy is luxury to some people."
1,Lacks Scholarship,"Tom Freidman's work is a collection of anecdotes and opinion with an occasional reference to an historical fact. As is always true of his work, it beguiles. He pretends an even handed look at the the Israelis and the Palestinians, but a close examination of his conclusion shows that he advocates tough TALK toward the Israelis and tough ACTION toward the Palestinians. Where are the statistics showing the amount of aid the U.S. has given to Israel vs the amount given to the Palestinians? Where are the facts concerning the number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli armed forces compared to the number of Israelis killed by Arab suicide bombers?"
5,"Compelling, objective & emotional all at the same time!","This book does not claim to be a work of objective history. It is the subjective view (almost a biography) of a journalist living through the Middle East's roughing patch in the 70s and 80s. It was very difficult to put this book down, and the emotion written within the pages are compelling.... Many facts are referred to in this book which doesn't fully explain the historical context.But once you are aware of the history, Friedman's views, experiences and opinions are interesting and compelling. His personal experiences -- from experiencing the death of his friend's family in Beirut to seeing his daughter scream when a Palestinian teenager broke their car's windshield with a stone -- make for a very emotional read. His opinions regarding the causes of the conflict are extremely logical and interesting.This book is a highly recommended read!"
4,"Still reading it, but intrigued","I am about half way through this book, published in 1989. It is a little out of date, so I will need to read Friedman's supplement that updates the book through 1995. It is fascinating. I've never really understood Middle East politics and now am gaining a better understanding of the difficulties and complexities of both sides. I also especially like the fact that Friedman has written a book on this subject that is relatively easy to read--not filled with a lot of intellectual philosophizing."
5,pure genius,"If you really want to understand the whole psychology and social mores of the Miidle East, driven by history and religion, this is a must read. This will help anyone understand the current situations which exist there and how different their society is from America and Europe. If you have to read one book on the Middle East, this is it."
3,plodding,"First, I'm glad we have a Thomas Friedman. I read him, I appreciate his insights, and while I probably will not be traveling to the Middle East sometime soon, I can understand the region a little better through his writing. Thanks, Mr. Friedman.Second, I'm glad I read this book, although the information is not as timely as it was when first published. Still interesting.But, oh my goodness, this book is boggy. You could get stuck, seriously.It's good to round out a book like this by reading more about the Middle East. Try to find something that offers a slightly pro-Isreal perspective, inform your mind."
2,"Should only pay for the ""Beirut"" part of this book.","Colorful and emphatic account of Lebanese civil war and Israel's involvement. Poetic, humanist, absorbing, and historically correct. Unfortunately Mr. Friedman's analysis is rather disconcerting in parts of the book describing Israel. It's not the belated in its originality, revisionist views on Holocaust and suspiciously vigilant and negative attitude to most of the things Israeli. It's that the author forgets there are casualties on both sides of the trenches."
4,From Beirut to Jerusalem,"I recommend this book whole heartedly by the fact that I consider it a classic by the way it helps the non-Middle Easterner understand how Lebanese Arabs and Israeli Jews actually think. In the events surrounding Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1983 the reader sees into the way that the different partys and religious groups manipulated one another to accomplish their objectives, and how the Isrealis and the Americans were mislead at times. Friedman does a masterful job. It is a must read for the person interested in about or living in that area of the world."
3,Mr. Friedman recounts his experiences in Beirut and Jerusalem during the Lebanon Civil War.,"The book is primarily composed of anecdotes and the author's personal impressions of the people involved, both those who could be considered actors in the events and more ordinary types of people who tried to maintain some semblance of normalcy and survive the mayhem that was engulfing them. Though the book contains some interesting insights it is not as captivating as his columns. My final analysis is that while ""From Beirut..."" is worth reading, Thomas Friedman, superb columnist that he is, makes it clear that accomplishment as a foreign correspondent does not necessarily translate into a great author of the stature of say, a Mark Bowden."
5,Best book on the Middle East,"If you only want to read one book on the Middle East, this is it. Despite all the press devoted to this area, the media does not offer context. This book does. It's an incredibly fast read and will open your eyes. Visit Apellicon's book recommendation site to read more reviews and see more book lists by category."
3,Never-ending conflict,"Good analysis of situation, but lacking the passion of the various point of view."
5,Great primer for understanding the Mid-East - Israel,"Slightly depressing, but a great overview of why the Arabs, Palestinians, and Israelis act toward each other the way they do."
3,"well written, but biased.","I'm sorry, but anyone who says this book is equally fair to both sides needs to be smacked. It is by far more pro-palestinian than pro-Israeli. Don't get me wrong, I think Friedman is an excellent writer and gives good arguments for the palestinian side. But if you're going to read this book, please also read the other side of the story. The complete Idiot's guide to the Middle East is good, and so is Myths and Facts, which can now be found ...So I suggest thisbook if you want the Palestinian perspective."
3,Book on CD's,This was my first look into the world of books on CD's & it was fair. The story was one that was recommended to me but I was not overly impressed. It felt more like a propanganda peice rather than true journelism. If you like the Middle East then you should enjoy this too.
4,Interesting,An interesting chronology and analysis of a journalist's decade long stay in Lebanon and Jerusalem. I learned a lot about the two countries and the issues that divide them. Friedman explained many complex issues with interesting analogies and I was impressed with his analysis of the true problems. A negative aspect of the book was that I often felt he was reporting the positions of the male elite and didn't truly capture the opinions and lifestyle for the majority of Israeli and Lebanese residents.
4,A multi-faceted view of the Middle East,"""From Beirut to Jerusalem"" ranks as one of the best books I've read pertaining to the Middle East. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it back down. (I know, sounds cliched, but it's true!) I've read a number of other books on Middle Eastern politics and culture, but few have captured the essence of the region more accurately than Friedman's version! The author's personal accounts glaze the book with an authentic and authoritative worldview about the many political and social facets that hold root in both Beirut and Jerusalem. Some of the stories are outright hilarious, and those readers who haven't been to the region (myself included) will find themselves enlightened by a view of the Middle East not found on the evening news. The author's personal stories are the treasure of this book, bringing the reader into a world of polar opposites - war/peace, religious/aetheist, democratic/totalitarian. A great book!"
1,Rambo's analysis,"No matter how ""exciting"" this book may be to read (and not to base our opinions upon), just like Hollywood's Rambo, where Stalone knows everything about his enemy and overcomes all the problems to finally kill a whole army or nation (where ironically they all happen to be in what is known today as ""terrorists"") and sells it all around the globe. Friedman thinks he knows it all when it comes to ""analysing"" the Lebanese crisis and the Israeli socio-religious complexity, while in my opinion reading about the Mideast's history may be helpful, in addition to some classical music knowledge at least to know that Pachelbel's CaNon doesnt include any firing of any caNNon. And by the way, a Canon is the strictest form of imitation in musical composition in which the voices or melodies begin one after another, at regular intervals, successively taking up the same subject."
3,"Bogs down, now is dated","This book grabbed me from the opening chapter and I really enjoyed the first third or so of the book. The study of the Lebanon situation in the ealry 80's makes this book worth reading overal.However, the book really bogs down in the middle with in-depth analysis of the internal conflicts Israel faces as well as the external. In the end though, I was disappointed that he went through such painstaking detail in examining the conflict from the Isreali side, but there are no interviews or reports from the Palestinian perspective. I wouldn't call it biased, but rather over-examining from one perspective, deficient from the other."
5,For your enlightenment pleasure,"If you want to get enlightened QUICK, read this book. It's a modern answer to the age-old quest."
4,Nice,Have not worn yet.I purchased the brass and they tarnish easily so will probably need to use anti-tarnish cloth on these.
1,Very cheap in person,"My daughter bought me these for Xmas and I was so disappointed when they arrived...I actually got them to go with a copper cuff bracelet I won...the quality between the two pieces is so evident...the bracelet is a beautiful heavy piece while the earrings are light and cheapy looking...the earrings are hardly worth the price they are listed for...I have bought clearance earrings at Target that out shine these...I was planning to save the copper set for special occasions but I'll have to find another pair of earrings to do the bracelet real justice...be forewarned, they look quite lovely online in the picture but not in person !"
3,"Not so bright, bulky","What you see in the picture is not really what you get. You get a bulky light that isn't very bright, so order a few if you buy these. I am using these for my motorcycle, and you really want to be in a place with no light to see these decently. So parking on the main drag to show others your neons won't really work in this case. Get something with more wattage."
5,Precsion Tool,"This rake is very thoughtfully designed, like virtually all W-G products. But please note, it is a little less wide than it looks in the pictures, about 13 inches, which is not a problem for me, but could be for some gardeners looking for a really wide rake. That said, the design and build are German engineering at its best and simplest. First, the shape: The tines are lightly bowed at the perfect angle to dig in lightly or deeply as you wish by varying the angle slightly. Second, the build: solid as a rock, with sharpened times that come to just the right point to lift and dig with minimal effort. The shiny surface of the the metal lets the dirt drop off easily, with minimal sticking. This snaps on easily to the interlock handles, which you will need to buy unless you have one already. This solid, sturdy rake should last forever in normal (or heavy) use."
5,Fantastic underated album deserves a hearing,"I worked at BMG some years ago and heard this. Frankly it is a crying shame this band did not pick up more attention. The album is on the sad side, however every track is solid and the album is one of my favourites. If you like Coldplay, Nirvana and Sheryl Crow - which I do - there is a good chance you'll like this. It is on the light side musically with loads of drum loops and relatively slight music - especially compared with Nirvana obviously. But there are loads of good songs that bear many repeated listens. To be critical some of the mixes and production could have been better and more natural / live, however most of the songs would sound good with just an acoustic and a voice.... 100000% better than most of the rubbish in the UK 'elect a pop star' charts."
3,"Not so bad, but Elric certainly went through rough weather","Like the first novel, this one showcases the same short prose from Moorcock. Yet in contrast to the first book ""sailor"" exudes a ""raw"" feel to it. Compared to part one, its sequel is a tad hurried and poorly crafted. The adventure with the other eternal champions is fine, but Elric's decision to hand over the throne Yrkoon stinks of pure logical incoherence. It's as if the Emperor of Melnibone forgave Yrkoon for the numerous attempts on his life. All this done without batting an eyelash.Moorcock is undoubtedly one of the greatest science fiction/fantasy writers of our time. This time however,his skill at navigating a story met with considerable problems."
1,Savage Dreams,"This book is classic eco paganistic 1/2 truths and full tripe. Solnit carries on a dreamy and irresponsible massive 'feel good' opinion piece about the handfull of people harmed by our successfull development of our deffensive nuclear weapons. The author fails to note that our development and limited use of our weapons saved millions of lives.If you are currently a eco pagan, here is more for your religion. If you want a full account of the history of our deffensive development of nuecs, don't waste your time reading this novel. However, if you want further insight into the basis that drives our planet's new pagan eco religion, then this book will help you to understanding their factualy fictionist journey into politics."
3,great coffee maker until....,"This was, for about 18 months, a wonderful coffee maker. The thermal carafe kept the coffee plenty hot (and it WAS hot) and its price was very reasonable. However, it has lately begun leaking all over the place. The problem is steam condensing at the top of the filter compartment, condensing, and running out and down so that that is a puddle on the counter every time. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why it took so long to start doing this, as there is no seal, the swing-out filter is still locking in just fine, etc."
3,Mr. Coffee 8 cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker,"I was somewhat disappointed in this product. It makes good coffee but it is slow and loud. Also, you have to put hot water in the thermal pot and let it stand for 5 minutes before you start the coffee so the pot stays warm. If you don't do this the coffee cools off fairly quickly. Also, there are two holes in the back of the water reservior of the machine that if you are not very careful pouring the water in, it will splash out all over the counter. A somewhat strange design."
1,Didn't work at all!,"I got this because of the reviews on amazon and am very disappointed. It won't turn on! I turn it on and it stays on for 5 seconds then turns off. I thought that we must've been doing something wrong, but we read the book and tried it several times and nothing...It's going back TODAY! I thought it would be great because we used to have a Mr. Coffee that we loved (it went to that big coffee pot in the sky, sadly)."
3,Coffe maker just ok,"It looks nice, but somehow the top cover of the coffee maker itself does not close properly intact. It leaves a gap where the water evaporates while it is brewing."
5,great coffee pot,THE COFFEE POT I PURCHASED IS INDEED A GREAT 1. I LOVE MY NEW COFFEE MAKER. COFFEE IS DONE FAST AND STAYS FRESH AND HOT FOR HOURS.
2,Returned it even though I got it for $15 ... poor quality!,"You'd think Mr. Coffee ... looks nice ... and when I got a new one at Target for $15 thought I got a deal. I performed so poor and inadequately, that I returned it, even though it was only $15 ... didn't brew well, didn't keep coffee hot, dribbles coffee all over, etc.It really makes me wonder how a company can make something that works soo poorly ... what a waste of their time and mine."
2,Disappointed,"Very noisy as it was dripping becaused the lid did not stay on tight. Also, did not keep the coffee hot for very long even after pre-warming as instructed."
4,Nice Little Machine,"I read all the reviews on this little guy. I went for it , and Im not disappointed. The coffee brews up nice and hot, but the second cup is not as hot but perfect for drinking. I timed it for my 3rd cup and 2 hours later, the coffee was still hot. Not hot- hot but just right. The lid is a little getting use to, but no problem. I set the timer last night, and this morning I had hot coffee. I machine shuts off immediately after it finishs brewing. Nice coffee maker--4 ****'s- I recommend getting the gold filter basket. Its a perfect mate."
1,ice coffee,"Definitely buy this if you like your coffee tepid. The coffee was hot for the first couple of months, but now I have to microwave it before it's warm enough to drink. I bought this unit because it's one of the few that will fit under my counter space, but I really need to get rid of it."
2,Not Pleased,"I have had more coffee running on the counter then in the pot. The water hits the back of the filter and push it down, and grounds get into your coffee, it also gets in the spout were the coffee flows in the pot, clogs it up and the coffee over flows to the counter. A real nuissance."
1,Wake up to a piercing audible ready signal!,"The URTX series has a really loud ""ready"" signal that cannot be turned off. If you don't want to wake up the entire household when your coffee is ready, get the URT (no X) model instead!"
2,Looking for a new coffee maker,"I have had my Mr. Coffee thermal coffee pot for 3 years and I would not buy it again. Why? First, the filter does not stay in place if I don't wet the filter down before adding my coffee 9 out of 10 times I have coffee grounds in my coffee. I have added hot water to the carafe and yes this helps but if you like to use the programmable feature of this pot you can't do this. My most frustrating complaint is how the carafe pours. It is impossible to poor a cup of coffee without spill a few drops of coffee on the counter. Very annoying! I'm currently shopping for a new coffee maker and was interested to read what others thought of this maker and if I was the only one that experienced difficulties."
1,Poor performance plus bad design,"I tried for a month to like this coffee maker, pre-heating the pot, etc. But the brutal truth is that the water just isn't as hot as it should be from the start. The cup you pour right after brewing is just barely hot enough, and it's downhill from there.Then, just as I was getting ready to give up anyway, the carafe started leaking at the seam between the stainless part and the plastic upper part that supports the handle and lid. I investigated and discovered a piece of really poor engineering, where a sharp rim of the stainless is forced against a very thin soft gasket in a way pretty much guaranteed to cut through it, after which you get little leaks that create stains on the side of the pot and, on especially good days, manage to dump enough of your freshly-brewing coffee on the counter to make a real mess.Forget it. This is a piece of junk. (Sad too, since some other Mr. Coffee makers have been favorites of mine.)"
1,Stopped working within months,"This looked good, was a well-known brand and was well-priced. I thought it was a no-brainer but it was only a matter of months before it simply stopped working. I never send in warranty info on things this cheap b/c I don't want to be added to any more mailing lists, so we were just out of luck. We should've stuck with the 20-year-old coffee maker we had. The pot was chipped and it was slow to start, but at least it got around to making a good pot of coffee."
1,Gevalia freebie better than this,"I don't want to give this ANY stars, but I had to give it one.I have never had a Mr. Coffee maker last. The free coffee makers from Gevalia make better coffee and last longer than any Mr. Coffee ever has and this one did not fail to disappoint.The insulated carafe would work great IF the coffee coming out were hot, as opposed to just over lukewarm. And there is NO heat in the plate to aid getting or keeping it hot. If you preset it, there's no way to pre-heat the carafe, so with the lukewarm coffee, the cold carafe and no heating plate I always have tepid coffee that I have to microwave to reheat in the morning.And, true to Mr. Coffee, it quit working after a few weeks.Well, back to Gevalia. [ http://www.gevalia.com/Gevalia/continuity/Control-Landing/Control_LP4.aspx?keycode=121235&vd;=15-000 ] Their coffee is a bit pricey but you can quit anytime, even though their coffee makers are free & don't quit."
2,Mr. Coffee 8-cup thermal programmable coffeemaker,The lid is too difficult to turn for seniors especially. The thermal carafe does not hold the heat long enough. I would not recommend it.
1,Poor,"The stainless steel pot is not good. First of all you must get rid of the metal tasteby soaking the pot in bleach for an hour or so. Secondly, it does not keep the coffee hotfor very long. The instruction book says to put hot water in the pot for at least five minutesbefore making coffee so it will warm up. This is very inconvient."
2,Don't buy this type.,"22 Dec 11All the work involvedMr. Coffee 8-Cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker: a pitcher to fill the container w/water, placing the filter in the basket, getting the lid screwed on, ""heating"" the pot, getting the lid unscrewed, making sure the power is off, ""drying"" the pot after. Also, the finished product has an ""uncooked"" look (water not hot enough?; didn't drip long enough?) and had an ""uncooked"" taste. I was so glad I didn't throw out the old percolator which I am still using."
3,mr coffee 8 cup thermal,This coffee make works well BUT the lid is VERY tight and difficult to open and close.I would not recomend this product to persons with weak or arthritic hands.
3,Mr. Coffee 8-cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker,Item brews coffee just fine but it is not hot.. always have to heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds!
3,Good coffee but Engineering flaws,"Just like others said, makes good coffee and keeps it hot for half-a-day nicely, but... the ""wand"" that puts the water into the basket keeps knocking down the back of the filter, then grounds get go through and start to clog things up. Been using it three months and it does it at least once a week. Also if you removed the pot while brewing, the device that is supposed to stop the flow will not seal tightly and coffee keeps pouring through. I had an older model for several years that worked much better in these respects."
3,"Free Replacement for ""Overheating Issue""","Length:: 1:19 MinsMy machine began to yield very little coffee for the amount of water I was using After calling Mr. Coffee, it turns out my machine was ""overheating."" They asked for my address and immediately sent a new unit in the mail. If your machine has begun to yield a small amount of coffee or is taking a very long time to brew, this may be your problem and I suggest you call them."
2,Ok but not the best on the market,"I have one of these and for the price, I wouldn't waste my money on it. It doesn't keep the coffee hot enough, the lid is difficut to work, it beeps 3 or 4 times when the coffee is ready and there is no way to turn that feature off, and I have trouble getting the filters to stay in place while brewing. They will fold over and get coffee grounds in the pot of coffee. On the other hand, it is a very attractive machine, the water reservoir is easy to fill since it can be removed and it is programable. But for the these few conveniences I feel that it is too expensive."
3,Love it BUT coffee spills,"Love it except it has one design flaw. Despite my four attempts to make sure everything was properly positioned, the coffee spilled all over the place instead of going into the carafe."
1,NOT AS THOUGHT!!,"TOO HARD TO UNSCREW TOP, BREW GETS COLD, NO HEATING PLATE, cANT BEAT THE LEAST EXPENSIVE MACHINE, DONT RECOMMEND. THIS"
2,coffeemaker,"Top of the coffee pot is very hard to twist off. When you program the coffeemaker for in the morning that works, but the coffee does not stay hot like it is suppose to. Does not pour very good either. So we feel we have wasted our money. And it was not cheap. We are going to buy another coffeemaker."
4,nice,"this pot works well and keeps your coffee warm for hours.my only issue is how the cap unscrews. If you have anything near arthritic hands or weak fingers (especially early in the morning!) it's very hard to twist the cap to get it to pour because the leverage is really poorly designed.other than that, it's perfect."
2,Not hot for long...,"I wish I'd read these reviews before going to the store to buy this machine. While it is quiet, easy-to-use, and keeps coffee fresh for quite awhile, I like my 3rd cup of coffee to be as hot as my 1st without using the microwave. My coffee drinking does not last all day so I'm not worried about keeping a pot fresh for four hours. I do not like this coffee pot - and I've had it for a few months now so I've given it enough time - and will be buying a different one. I might keep this one around for when we have company that drinks decaf...but I won't be using it anymore!"
1,Started out grate then two months later NOTHING,Started out great luckily i kept the box... this coffee pot kept shutting off and brewing only half way which I had to keep pressing the button twice. My coffee in the carafe was COLD not hot like when I first had it. TOOK it back now switching away from MR. COFFEE !!
2,Not for anyone with arthritis in their hands,I have had this coffee maker for about 6 months now and I think I've decided that I just don't like it. I have the beginnings of arthritis in my hands and trying to open the carafe first thing in the morning when my hands are still a bit stiff is a real challenge. To keep the coffee hot the lid has to be on pretty tight and I find it very difficult to open. I too have had the problem with the filter falling over and getting the pot full of grounds. I guess if it weren't for the difficult lid I might spring for a permanent filter but I think I'll just get another machine.
2,Lukewarm coffee,"I've had this coffee maker for about 6 months. It makes a good first cup of coffee. After the first cup though, I have to microwave every cup. The carafe just doesn't keep the coffee warm - it starts cooling down right away and gets cold within about an hour and a half. If you don't mind micro-waving your morning coffee, or if you like your coffee luke warm or cold, then buy this product. Otherwise keep shopping."
2,"Sorry, I'm not happy with this one but...","It proves you only get what you pay for. My old Mr. Coffee, which lasted over five years, died. I wanted a thermal design at an reasonable price. This little devil makes me 3 1/2 cups which is ok as I am the only coffee drinker (usually when manufactures say ""cup"" they mean 6 oz. cups). However, with company this pot is not convenient. The lid is tough to twist off and on. Pouring water into the thing is messy. The water level on the side is hard to see and I have brewed coffee on my counter top too many times to count. I continue to use it as it was the least costly of any I found. Next time I'll spend more. Most coffee makers are too tall to fit under counters. The new Mr. C under counter maker would be nice if it had a thermal carafe. Would not recommend this one."
4,Neat Coffee Maker,"Overall I really like this coffee maker! The stainless steel carafe is great! I only wish that the heating plate remained on for 10-20 minutes or so after brewing. It turns off right after the brewing is done. Which is a bit annoying especially when I set the timer for morning brewing and I'm running late. Plus, the ""alarm timer"" is called ""delay"" or something like that. Why not just call it ""alarm"" or ""timer?"""
1,already not working,"Had the pot a little over a year ,bought 2 and 1 just recently stopped pushing water through...."
2,Not Impressed,"Not only was this a pain-in-the-neck to use, but the carafe didn't keep the coffee hot AND it made mediocre to lousy coffee. We returned it within a week or two of receiving it."
2,Does not keep coffee hot,"If you like to take your time drinking your coffee in the morning, do not purchase this coffee maker. IT DOES NOT KEEP COFFEE HOT. If you like to slam your coffee, then this may work for you. It does make a decent cup."
2,fair at best,"After spending a lot of time shopping for a thermal, programmable coffee maker with a reasonable price, I decided on this one from Mr Coffee, a brand I have had before.The coffee is warm at best when it is first made, so is never hot. I use paper filters, and they often fall over in the basket, allowing for grounds to fall into the coffee. I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago, but am already looking for a replacement. I do like the ease of the programmable feature.Would not recommend this product."
1,Would not cycle all the water.,"After about 10 days from date of purchase, only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle. I would have to push the On button, get another 2 cups. After 5 or 6 tries I would finally get all 8 cups through. The design is bad for left handed people. It's very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate. The lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and I would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid. Overall not a good design. I got my money back and am bought a Hamilton Beach Brewstation which I think is a great coffemaker."
1,No warmer and metal pot makes coffee cold!,"Having a coffee maker that you can set up the night before to brew as you get up is great. But this device relies entirely on the thermal pot to keep the coffee warm. The weight of the pot with the double metal walls and it does a great job of cooling the coffee down to just over body temp. The thermal pot should prevent coffee from scorching, so why not put a heating element there??? If you want HOT coffee, you have to run the device first with water only to warm the pot and then run it to make coffee. This thing is a disaster.Finally, enough with the specialized lids and sneaky valves. God forbid you forget to put the screw down lid on at 6 in the morning. The drip basket stops the coffee flowing and the whole brewing mess goes back into the filling resevoir. Can't they make the anti-drip value removable?? I can wait the three minutes for my coffee to brew and I can see when the coffee is coming out of the drip basket."
1,Don't buy this!!!,I've never been so disappointed with a product. The water does not get hot. The coffee comes out looking and tasting like very weak tea. You can't get the coffee out of the carafe without entirely removing the lid. I'm working with the company right now for a refund and it is a long process. Spend a little more on a Krups or a Cuisinart. It will be worth the time and hastle.
2,Not a better idea,This coffee maker was a disappointment from the beginning. Heating water to pre- warm the carafe is both time consuming and energy inefficient. The screw-in top was so poorly moulded that it was difficult to get started and almost impossible to align the arrows. It makes a decent cup of coffee since most of the components are the same as regular Mr Coffee machines except that this one has no warming pad. After a couple of weeks we stopped using it. What a waste!
4,coffee maker,"great coffee maker .I take it with me when i go out of town,it's just the right size. thank you"
3,Clock Radio Phone with Caller ID,The phone and alarm work okay. I would have preferred it to be easier to program. I would like to be able to program it without getting out the manual.
5,A Fabulous Introduction to the Hermetica,"The original Hermetica is 17 books - a Greek translation from the Egyptian language. This rare treasure by Timonthy Freke and Peter Gandy brings you the best of the best in this 5000 year old ancient classic. Also starting with podcast #103, SuperWisdom.com Foundation hosts a podcast series centered on this book. My co-host and I are deeply touched by the profound and inspiring wisdom in this little book, and the highly readable way it is presented. The reader below who gave this a one star is way, way off base. Such treasures as this belong in the library of every serious spiritual seeker."
2,Incompetent Presentation of the Hermetica Corpus !,"I am sad to inform the readership that this treatise is sorely deficient as to a reasonable presentation of the ancient magic Eyptian literature of the inter-testamental period [200 BCE - AD 300].The authors have no clue as to what contituted 'wisdom' in the ancient Semitic societies. They cetainly know nothing about Egyptian pharonic royalty and its scribal culture.It is a deligthful book for the ignorant and the mad. Their self-deceptions will be nourished well by its colossal incompetence. The authors have made a contribution to inanity, thoughtlessness and mental laziness.John E.D.P. Malin & James F.D.P. MalinInformatica CorporationCecilia, LAZ 70521-0460--"
5,well sumaarized,"The book is very easy to read and follow: which is the intention of the authors. The chapters are excellently introduced and short. I liked also the authors arguments that the Hermetica is an ancient Egyptian wisdom, and NOT Greek. Hermes is a Greek god equated to Tehuti: Tehuti (Egyptian) is the author of the ""Hermetica"", who is also called Thoth, or Hermes. The focus of the book is on the origin of existence and its intricacies. A good summarized book on Hermetic wisdom."
4,Crafts & Hobbies,Filled with projects to try out. It has a lot of different things to learn about but I bought it to learn about working leather and stained glass. Very good purchase.
3,A good technique book.,It is an older book but has some useful information about several different types of crafting.
1,:(,This product did not help me quit smoking like it is supposed to :( it got here in a timely matter but did not work... will not be buying this again!
3,A decent unit but very poor remote and manual,"I previously owned a Yamaha DSP-1000 sound processor that had more power, sounded as good or better than the Denon, and had a much better remote and manual. I would not recommend it for the above reasons."
1,DOO GRO OIL,I brought this a while back when I got it i open the box it was spilled and everything i was like oh my damn I will just go too the beauty supply store from now on when it come too Oil's and things very disappointed
5,Paperback Book,"Excellent and Speedy Service, As Good or Better than Advertised, for Early Book Publication Dates (60's, 70's), a Great Source I'll Use Again."
4,Art Sinsabaugh DVD,"Excellent DVD. I can't wait to show it to the Rockford Camera Club. Since we live so close to Chicago where Art Sinsabaugh got his start, it is a shame not many people know about this photographer. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to become a landscape photographer."
4,World Music Trip Hop you can chill out to,"One of the better compilations in the ""chill out"" genre at the moment, this double album by renowned DJ Chris Zippel has an exotic world music feel to it. Heady, pulsating, sensual tracks featuring Cocteau Twins, Plaid, Lemongrass, Yonderboi, and Ohmegatribe make this an ethereal, richly textured listening experience."
5,James Garner vs. Clint Eastwood in a superb western comedy.,"This is required viewing and a unique experience for Clint Eastwood admirers since he has a huge role as a colorful but loathesome gunfighter/villain and plays it sublimely well. Edgar Buchanan (the marvelous character actor that played ""Uncle Joe"" on ""Petticoat Junction"") and Abby Dalton round out the guest cast of this sensational episode of ""Maverick"" with James Garner. Bret Maverick (Garner) and Eastwood are at loggerheads over Dalton and the sequences illustrating Eastwood's quick-draw ability and Garner's reactions to it are extremely funny and perfectly played straight. The saloon fistfight between Garner and Eastwood is riveting and Maverick's gentle friendship with Buchanan's character is beautifully drawn. This was the first episode of ""Maverick"" to be offered on video and with good reason. No one could possibly be disappointed with this episode of my favorite television series."
2,For Sizzla Fans Only,"I'm hardly ever disappointed when I buy a Sizzla CD, but he puts out so many in a year that one is always way better than the others. This is not the one. I only really like about 3 songs on this album. And that one labeled 'remix' is practically just an acapella. The sound quality of this production could be better too. So if u're already a sizzla fan and you have an MP3 player, you can just rip the good tracks and fyah bun de rest...Lyrically and performance wise, this is typical Sizzla; musically, its more roots, reggae and some ole school riddims than contemporary dancehall like the 'rise to the occassion' release..."
4,Action Central,Reporter Nelson Ingram involves himself in darkside matters better left to professionals. This is a logical sequel to Clark's Summer Latitudes. The plot follows a circuitous path of circumstances that threaten the extinction of Ingram and friends.A good summer read that has whetted my appetite for more of the same.Al Day
3,Not typical L'Amour,"Fans of L'Amour Westerns have come to expect face-paced, tightly plotted adventure stories with lots of authentic historical detail. This book is a departure from most of L'Amour's other books both in terms of subject matter and writing style. It is set in the Southwest, but in the modern day, and it is as much a science fiction novel as a Western. It involves a search for the lost Anasazi Indians involving mysterious inter-dimensional doors in the Southwestern desert. While it is refreshing to see the author exploring some new creative territory, this book suffers from several flaws. Uncharacteristically for L'Amour, the novel is meandering and repetitious--the story could have been told better in half as many words. And while it contains a fair amount of detail about Southwestern history and culture, some of the anthropology he brings in is outdated, suspect, or both."
3,Interesting but too much filler,"At first, the book was gripping. Then the story began to drag as the author piled on more and more filler material. Primarily, this filler consisted of the protagonist's incessant mental ramblings. At one point, I thought to myself, ""if he asks himself that same question one more time, I'm going to slap him!"" I began skipping large chunks of these ramblings without losing the thread of the story at all.These faults aside, the story remained interesting to the end. I recommend the book, with the caveat that you should be prepared to skip a page or two here or there."
2,Yadda Yadda Yadda,"I was excited at the prospect of reading my first Louis L'Amour book for my Book Club. The basic premise of the story was interesting but all of the repetitive questions drove me nuts! The book could have been reduced by one third had he not repeated the same information, over and over and over and over and over! I may try another L'Amour book, but if this book is indicative of his style, I'll swear off his books for good!"
1,Science Fiction Meets the Old West,"Without exception, in my opinion, this is the worst book Bantam ever published by Louis L'Amour. Perhaps it is because I like ""tradtional"" westerns, or because the book is just plain ""slow"" especially at the beginning as L'Amour sets the plot. Either way, unless you need this book to complete your set of his work, forget it. Louis L'Amour wrote some great westerns early in his career, but later on he let his philosophy of life and the like interfere with the story telling. Spend your money else where is my advice."
2,Not up to his usual standards,"There was way too much telling rather than showing in this book. And the telling was repeated, nearly word-for-word, over and over and over again.Suspension of disbelief was hampered by the protagonist ignoring obvious danger signals, and areas that could have been developed for suspense were glossed over. The ending was no great surprise, although a last-minute twist did provide a moment of enjoyment.Alas, too little, too late. The concept was great, and with more research in physics and anthropology, it could have withstood even the pedestrian writing. But it just doesn't deliver."
2,Could have been great.,"Found an old hardcover of this packed away, had read it many years ago, forgotten all about it, and read it again. The premise was good, very mysterious at the start...but then it fails on several levels. Long stretches of the book are very boring. Repeated long drives, with the same thoughts in the protagonist's head. Long conversations with the same dull characters over and over. Very little action until towards the end, and even then it's blunted. I got through this book very quickly as I felt I was reading the same lines over and over. Could have been much better given the premise."
5,One of L'Amour's best books,"This book came out when I was in middle school. School was boring for me so I spent most of my time reading Louis L'Amour. This book was always my favorite. Possibly I can better relate to the setting because I live in the Southwest. Also, I am interested in Native American history. What happened to the Anasazi? This book is a colorful imaginative (obviously fictional) look at what happened. Throughout my life I continue think about this book... I've read it multiple times and it never gets old for me."
4,Great reading!,"I originally borrowed a copy of this book off of an uncle who had most of Louis Lamour's books. I ended up reading it until it started to fall apart, so I bought him a new copy. The only problem I have with the storyline is that the author took abiout 60% of the book just to get the main hero from one side of the ""viel"" to the other. I wish he had made the remaining part of the book just a little longer.In this book the author has the protagonist find the Iron Mountain, an old steamboat that disappeared in the late 1800's. No-one knew what happened to it, only that a steamboat nearly ran into the barges it had been taking upriver on the Mississippi. I suppose that finding it in an alternate dimension is as plausible as anything else. I still pull my copy of this book off the shelf and read it as often as possible."
2,The Mesa that could have been more.,"I like a strong character that is prepared to fight the evil and bad in the world and has no ""backdown"" in them. Mike Raglan is all of that, but he is dragged down way to much in this story by his continued self doubt and always asking himself if he is doing the right thing. ""Enough already"" I enjoyed the story which has an exciting finish, but it could have been done in 100 pages instead of 427 pages. It was a struggle to stay with, but I did. This was my first LOUIS L'AMOUR book, but I will try another someday."
1,"Surely Louis didn't write this,","This is one of the first books that I have ever not been able to finish because it was so terrible. I've read dozens or more Louis L'Amore books and enjoyed them. He's had a few absurd relationships in his books before but this one takes the cake. In the middle of the book he randomly starts calling another character honey and acting as though they've been an item for years when they only just met. And the rattling on and on about the same ideas the main character is having....reminds me of when friends of guy trouble and can't stop repeating the same scene over and over again to avoid doing anything. It was simply awful. I don't know if he wrote this or someone else wrote it for him, but it certainly wasn't his typical style of writing. Maybe loose ends got brought together at the end, but I didn't make it. Get his other books and let this one go the way of the anasazi."
3,Could have been better.,"I've read several of his books, this is not the best, by far. It was good, but not up to the usual standard. The linkage between events was broken and the dialogue with the Indians was totally unrealistic. It is worth reading, just don't expect too much."
3,Needed Editing,"Not tightly written like most LL books. It seems to wander a lot, and has whole paragraphs of nothing but questions floating through the mind of the protagonist (in one place two such paragraphs, back-to-back). Also repetitive in places; I found myself skimming a lot. Promising concept, but reads like a rough draft. Where was the editor???"
2,Haunted Mesa is not haunting.,"Maui H.S.I've read Louis L'Amour and I can't believe he wrote this book. I believe he started the book because the first couple of chapters were a could not put down draw you in. Then up until the ending, it was so boring and repetitive the story lost its energy. I wanted to shoot Mike Raglan myself. He whined and did drama about not wanting to be there to help Erik, but forced himself to stay. Characters were brought in like Louis used to do for an effect and time, but Louis used the characters well and then let them go. In this book the characters come and go without rhyme or reason and have little value in the overall story. The ending picked up, but it was a let down. The dog saves the hero, the men get the girls, and the opening is closed forever, what tripe. Although this was meant as a posthumous testament to Louis, whoever wrote it needs to keep his day job. Louis L'Amour was one of a kind."
2,MESA VERDE CONJECTURE,"I have been to and thru Mesa Verde, so bought this book in Denver. I knew it had to be fiction since the Anasazi have left nothing of themselves behind to refute Mr. L'Amour's conjecture. A great deal of this book is questions, questions and more questions. I was tired of all the question marks over every little piece of evidence.Mike Raglan equivocated on every decision he made... and this was a man who was supposed to have ions of experience with the perimeters of the occult. But I stuck it out til the end. The last book I read of Mr. L'Amour's was Wagon Master, I think, and I was just a teenager then. He wrote Hondo which John Wayne starred in and that was great.I take this book with a grain of salt. Fairly interesting, but I will stick to his Westerns from now on."
1,Boring,"I read this book because I am familiar with the Mayan stories of Xibalba (which L'Amour transcribes as Shibalba). He transfers the location to the American Southwest. Fine so far. But the plot is VERY thin. He repeats the same questions over and over and over - Who are these people? What are they doing? What do they want? What does it all mean? Etc. Etc. This becomes extremely tedious and boring. Also, I was expecting/hoping for some plot twists. Nothing. I could have guessed the outcome of the book after the first few pages. A complete waste of time."
3,Not L'amour's Best,"This book is a step away from the normal L'amour story with supernatural overtones, although the characters still have the author's stamp. I found it very repetitive with the main character having the same thoughts being mentioned over and over. I kept waiting for him to do something instead of talking or thinking about it through most of the book. It is not one of L'amour's better efforts."
4,Not at all what I expected of a L'Amour book.,"Growing up near this story's setting, it really hit home. Makes anybody stop and wonder...The beginning is slow moving but the last 1/3rd of the story is very exciting. It took me 2 weeks off and on to read the first 2/3rds of the book. It took me about 2 hours to finish it. You won't put it down once the plot has been built.I would rate this book 5 stars, but some characters whom I was interested in were left out of the ending. The book finishes without even making mention of what becomes of them and leaves you to guess as to their fate.If you like Westerns as well as Science Fiction, you will love this book. L'Amour does seem to steal a little from Star Trek as well as Star Gate."

5,Best choice,"Good quality, only flag with applique embroidered. Beware of those one-sided flags w/ iron-on logos."
3,Listen,I would like to listen to the songs o n this album. How can i get to listen to it? Julia Reid
5,Best of the lot,"We have been looking and evaluating TV/DVD/VCR sets for over a year.I waited until the price went down as when it first came out it was $599.I am glad we have it. It does have the very best picture and is also the best looking. This is my first Toshiba.It is so nice to plug it in and go.Notice: as with most of the combos, you cannot watch another channel when recording another. You have to watch what is recording or turn it off as it will record when the TV is off.It will also copy DVD's to tape if the DVD is NOT copy protected."
3,Failed on VHS Play,"The picture is great, the sound is great BUT the very first VHS tape I played shut down the entire system. It is now going to the shop AND I get to PAY to have it picked up and delivered ! Toshiba is adamant that this 80+ pound is a portable for me. Customer service knows to say I'm sorry, but are unwilling and unable to change the no-pay-for-pickup warranty terms. I'll update this review post the repair. So far, it's nice but too expensive if it keeps breaking. Buy with caution."
4,one of the best but not yet revised,"this book perhaps one of the best, mr oong describes the long history of Pencak Silat, shows the careful research of mr oong, from his experience as pencak silat athlete and his long study. Tells more about pencak that you may never thought (there's always competition on every sport)including the spiritual sides of this traditional martial arts. also including the interview with the pioneers. But this book needs to be revised immediately, there's a lot of change on Pencak silat today. Some of the text does not match with the reality again, except the history of Pencak silat."
4,Mid-Sixties Lightheartedness,"The fourth in a series of ""Golden Records"" by Elvis. Originally released in 1968 and remade in 1997 with bonus tracks, this album is an easylisting compilation. To close off an era, this album contains 8 of the bigger hits from the movies. Of course, most people know these songs and as a fan I can say: they're nice but not Elvis' best work. But, songs like Return to Sender, Viva Las Vegas and Rock-A-Hula Baby are pleasing to the ear and describe Elvis' sixties career like no other. So: essential songs for any fan.The remake of this album contains 6 bonus songs, and these non-movie tracks are the best in my opinion. Tracks like Indescribably Blue, Ask Me and Crying in the Chapel are so fresh-sounding, and Elvis' voice was the best then. These songs are a gift to your ears.So, this album should be in your collection, whether you're a big fan or just an ""enjoyer""."
4,"BETTER, BUT NOT THE BEST","Elvis' Golden Records volume four is an improvement over the earlier edition of this cd because it includes six additional songs. However, one of the songs, Rock-A-Hula, is quite inferior to every other song on this cd. Instead of Rock-A-Hula, the cd would be better served to include Wild In The Country.John"
3,"Woulda, Coulda","I wanted to like this book because the concept sounded really interesting, but the story itself was very lacking in depth. Nanotime read more like a detailed story layout rather than an actual story. None of the characters were very interesting, mainly because most of them never lasted more than a chapter or two, and those that did were less than two dimensional. The reader was given some insight into the main character, but not really enough to make him seem like a main (or likeable) character.The story needed more substance.The prominent characters needed more development.The short, choppy chapters needed better flow.The story climax and ending was weak.From what I've read, this was Kosko's first novel, and while there was potential, it did not inspire me to seek out more of his work."
3,TIME FOR A SECOND OPINION?,"I have enjoyed the Alex Delaware series very much, but THERAPY doesn't come anywhere near the rest of the books. Kellerman weaves a plot so intricate and mundane that it's easy to lose focus on what is going on. For example, his relationship with Milo seems tired and nothing new is revealed; also his love interest in this one, Allyson, is nowhere near as involving as his up and down relationship with Robin, who is only briefly used in this novel.Kellerman gives us no one to really care about, and there are no surprises in the whodunit arena. Kellerman is falling into his wife's dilemma by starting to inject the Jewish plight into his novels; leave that to Faye; you don't need it. There are too many characters involved in too many circuitous ways to allow the reader to experience any kind of empathy or concern.All in all, Jonathan, THERAPY is just dull and doesn't do justice to the excellent novels you wrote before this."
3,Not enough action,"Although this book presents a somewhat interesting mystery, there is almost no action. Most of the book consists of plodding investigative work with the truth gradually emerging, as in an archeological dig, where the researchers are slowly brushing off each bone. I much prefer the action of a Michael Connelly or Robert Crais or John Sanford book. This one's too dry; too slow."
2,"Sad, but true","I have a special fondness for Alex Delaware and his plights. I'm completely addicted to this series, I have to admit. But I was so disappointed in this book. It seemed to me that the author got bored with his own characters and plot line. And the exposition-- come on! In any case, I appreciate anyone's writing and the work that goes into a project like this. But, I've come to expect more from Mr. Kellerman, and I hope to be able to justify my addiction with his next book."
2,Not his best by a long shot,"This book just does not have the vitality and snap of previous books. About half way through you wonder if you will have the energy to finish and, to some degree, regret purchasing same.I learned that I will WAIT on new books and look at more of the reviews.Not going to delve into the plot,you can see that with the editorial reviews but I recommend you pass on this one."
3,"O.K., but not a winner","Jonathan Kellerman is all over the place in Therapy. It could be broken up into substantial parts of several other books. Although Therapy contained many interesting characters and situations, the overall effect and subsequent ending was an unmemorable, circuituous route. This book reminds me of a buffet in a beautiful restaurant that is spectacular at first sight only to become mediocre by the end of the meal. I enjoy Jonathan Kellerman and will continue to read his books. Being a Los Angeles area resident, I enjoy going along for the ride through familiar streets and venues. He has a knack for capturing the L.A. essence in his characters. However, it has been a while since Kellerman produced a real winner."
3,"Not bad. Not great, but not bad.","Kellerman has most of the good stuff back in this book. We have a love triangle, a tricky murder, and a solid tie-in to psychological concerns. Unfortunately, he chokes on the ending and does not manage to pull it through to a conclusion that the strong beginning deserves.Still, I'm encouraged to see that he can turn in a series entry this strong this late into the series. I'll pick up Rage with a lighter heart and more hope sometime in the near future."
3,Entertaining but not thrilling,"The bad and stupid characters are early guessed and then the pieces work themselves together almost agonizingly so.Predictability is not always bad. This is a good book to leave in the car for those times you get stuck waiting for somebody or you have a few minutes to kill - you can pick up the plot without much thought.Suggestion: the author, Jonathan Kellerman, needs a geography lesson. Sacramento is where the legislature meets in California. Abandon your created city, it is annoying."
3,lovers lane double murder mystery,"I was disappointed by the sort of vague characterization and slow pace to this novel , and a somewhat hard-to-follow plot, lacking in surprises and suspense. But I can see why this series is such a ""hit"", and I bet I would like the other ones more. This author has a great eye for details and provokative plotting. I will continue to read him again.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
2,Huh?,"I agree with another viewer - this book is too confusing to be enjoyable. There were too many characters, too many possibilites, too many twists, turns, dead ends and too many crimes done by too many people. I finished it with a sigh of relief."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Please don't read this one for you first Kellerman, Alex Delaware book. It falls far short of Kellerman's past Delaware stories. Too many characters and the wrap up of the murders just doesn't cut it for me. When Kellerman starts in on the African genocide, the book's rhythm takes a 180 and fizzles out from there to the end."
1,Way Too Long,I got the audio book and couldn't wait for the end. The story line was too involved and all over the place. As much as I like Alex Delaware he couldn't pull this one out!
2,Disappointing.....,"I'm a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware series. This book, being one of them, was a major disappointment. It clearly did not live up to the others. The plot was weak and there were far too many characters introduced which only served to confuse and muddle the already bumpy plot. I stuck with it hoping it would eventually take off but sadly, it didn't."
4,convoluted fun,"This is the first Kellerman book I've read, and I want more. ""Therapy"" has all of the proper ingredients for a great crime novel: Witty, realistic dialogue, widely varied characters, and twisty plotting. And it has corrupt Beverly Hills psychologists. What more could you want?I didn't mind not having background knowledge of the main characters, because that wasn't important to the story. A few paragraphs about their prior crime-solving escapades or love lives didn't weigh the plot down."
2,Nothing insightful in Therapy,"Jonathan Kellerman needs to get some therapy about his writer's block. This book was poorly written with plenty of 'filler' and not much story. His editor needed to cut out endless passages that do not add to the story telling or plot. For example, his love life adds nothing but some misguided ""insight"" of a therapist. In the jacket, it says the author is a psychologist, but he writes like he has never seen a couch, let alone been in the profession.In short, the book is a waste of time when there are so many other great books out there. read ""Motherless Brooklyn"" or reread Dan Brown , butn don't waste your time on this one flat bore."
3,Disappointing,"I love Jonathan Kellerman's stories about Alex Delaware and his friend Milo Sturgis, but this one, like Mr. Kellerman's last book ""Conspiracy Club,"" was not up to par.The plot got bogged down in the intricacies of government funding and Medi-Cal billing. The average citizen dislikes dealing with insurance in real life, so why would they want to read about it in their spare time? Too many characters contributed to this problem. I found it hard to care about Gavin Quick, and it was even harder to figure out whether he was a bad guy or a good guy. Ditto for his father, aunt, and ex-girlfriend. And why the long ramble about the girl who was found in the car with him? Background is one thing, Mr. Kellerman, but superfluous writing is quite another.Go back to psychology and murder, and leave the California insurance business alone, Mr. Kellerman. Your books are much more enjoyable that way."
4,Back to Mystery,"With Therapy, Kellerman returns to Alex Delaware and Milo as people trying to solve mysteries by understanding the motivations of criminals and those around them. This is at the heart of what makes the series work.Seeing through people's lies and self-deceptions to find out what's really going on is the challenge of this novel - especially when many of the lies are shielded by the confidentiality invoked by therapists even when it's themselves, not the patient, they're protecting. Kellerman is a master at creating real and interesting characters. Nobody does it better, and I thought this was one of his best.Those who want the soap opera of Robin to continue ... well, you get a tiny bit of it. But frankly, when she ditched him I thought he was well shut of her, and now that she won't leave him alone, I'm getting fed up..."
3,Interesting,"A young couple is found dead in a car in Beverly Hills. Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware begin an investigation. The young woman is proving to be difficult to identify. They soon discover the young man was being seen by psychologist Mary Lou Koppel. In a strange twist, it is revealed that another patient of Koppel's was murdered a little over a year ago. Another murder soon follows. The first half of this book was great with Milo and Alex tracking down clues. Then the pace slows a bit and the plot becomes a little scattered. At first, I thought the international angle was over the top, but by the end it made more sense. I always enjoy the interaction between Milo and Alex and it was in good supply in this outing. So, although the story bogged down in places and at times seemed over-complicated, it was an interesting read and the good ending left me satisfied."
3,Another reviewer...,"said it best when accusing Jonathan Kellerman of ""going through the motions"". Good ingredients in this story -- a lot of Milo and Alex acting as sidekicks; a solid resolution to the ""Robin"" angle, with Robin now out of his life, and an interesting newlove in it.The plot begins crisply, and Kellerman weaves a typical television psychologist into the mix (more of a PR specialist than a therapist). But the mystery bogs down when an international flavor is added and the final resolution is way, way out there...beyond what the reader needed or wanted. I don't know if Kellerman doesn't outline his plots and resolutions in his drabber books beforehand, and just continues to build castles in the air when trying to finish, or if he just gets bored.Anyway, a disappointment after his resurrection of Alex Delaware mysteries over the course of the last three books in series. Trite, and not worth your time."
2,Oh Jonathan what did you do?,"As a regular fan and reader of all things Kellerman (including Faye) I rushed right out and purchased Therapy. Right from the begining things didn't feel right. In this book Milo and Alex spend all their time driving around LA, narrating the streets they are on, taking the reader down different who-done-its senarios, without ever really connecting the dots. Also Robin makes a cameo, but you ask yourself why, because it added NOTHING to the story. Allison's presence in the book is also unremarkable, and at the end it made me curious if she was just in the book to meet Mr. Kellerman's page requirement. Finally, the mystery characters were so disjointed that I became frustrated trying to remember why they were involved in the plot. I finished this book last night and I thought thank goodness that is over. It really was a terrible book and I gave it two stars because I'm still a Kellerman fan. Let's just hope he hasn't lost his touch."
2,This was a disappointment,"I had a hard time finishing this book. The characters were all created nicely, but the book bored me, the end was just too bland, nothing shocking, and no resolution for the reader. I won't read any more of his books."
1,What is with this guy!1,"I picked this book up cheap at a goodwill store, glad I didn't spend more than $.90 on it.I have read several novels by j. Killerman with Milo and Alex and I wonder who is really the gay one. I mean Alex spends most of his time describing what person is wearing and watches and shoes and ear rings and on and on. And as for him being a psychologist - whoopee - that is about as far from a respectable doctor as you can get.I didn't read all of the book and gave it back to goodwill so some other sucker could by it. This author is terrible, he needs to find another way to make a living and quit boring everyone to death."
3,Alex Delaware from the Cookie Cutter,"I guess Kellerman had some contractual obligations to fulfill when he churned this one out with a cookie cutter. It's just not up to his usual standards. The basic premise, rich clients, radio shrink, Medicare fraud could have added up to his best ever but after the initial ride up the roller coaster hill we found ourselves on the kiddy ride. It was difficult to connect with any of the characters and I kind of resented the brief cameo appearances of individuals from former books. Hopefully Kellerman will recover from his writers block or whatever caused this infirmity and our next visit with Alex Delaware will be up to par. bg"
4,Enjoyed it,"My 2nd audiobook of Kellerman's Delaware and Sturgis team. First one was RAGE. First of all, the narrator Rubinstein is nothing short of perfect the way he portrays Delaware and Sturgis. I found the book interesting and entertaining from beginning to end. I liked it better than RAGE.Ending was a little flat but not as bad as RAGE's. I recommend the book.....especially the audio book!"
3,You talk too much,"Not as engaging as the most recent entries in the series. This story moves focus away from Milo. Additionally the ending is unsatisfactory, leaving a bad guy beyond reach."
3,Just an ok murder mystery. His other books were more.,"I've been a fan of Jonathan Kellerman because his books are not only well written with intriguing plots, they also are real novels with real characters and pyschological insights from the protagonist Alex Deleware. Therapy, the latest book, is written well and has a good plot, but that's it. I didn't learn anything from the book. It didn't get me thinking. It is just an OK murder mystery. The other books in the series were much more than that."
3,"Not his best, but worth the read or listen","Don't you just love Milo...what a detective. This is a pretty convoluted story, but as always Kellerman makes it easy to follow. I listened to this book on tape and enjoyed it. I'm so glad Robin is out of Alex's life, she was just such a self centered drag. Allison seems a lot more agreeable to hearing what Alex goes through with his cases with Milo. This really was an enjoyable listen...hope you'll try it."
3,Delaware takes on pop psychology,"Psychologist Alex Delaware again teams up with his gay, dour homicide cop friend Milo Sturgis to investigate the double murder of a young couple on a lonely lovers' lane in the LA hills. It's not the first - or the last - work of this particular killer and the trail leads into the big-money world of pop-psychology and government-subsidized real estate.Much of Kellerman's popularity rests on compulsive readability. It's an elusive quality, relying on character and plot development more than action. But this time Kellerman seems to be going through the motions, putting his characters through their paces on a paint-by-numbers set, and that engaging readability fizzles out early."
2,Downward path continues,"The Delaware series continues to worsen. Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware are increasingly self-righteous, sanctimonious, and cartoon tough. I initially liked this series because Milo, at least, seemed to have conflicts and to be an unlikely police detective hero. However, increasingly the series seems to be a vehicle for exposing what must be Kellerman's own aversions and predilections. The characterization is cardboardy (even by the none-too-demanding standards of detective fiction) and the plot is diffuse and unsatisfying."
3,Skimpy Intro to Herbal Treatments,"This slim book (mine had 34 pages) covers a variety of ailments (arthritis, asthma, cleansing, colds, ear infection, energy, eye wash, heart, infection, kidneys, lungs, nervous tension, obesity, pain, prostate, respiratory, sleep, thyroid, ulcers, and urinary tract). The problems are listed alphabetically with a sentence or two about the herbs used for it.It lacks detail in the amount or preparation of the herbs, so I don't find it as useful as the larger herbals."
5,#1,"After one listen to this c.d. I realized just how underrated Kenny Chesney really is. This c.d. just dosen't have a couple good songs and the rest crappy songs, like a lot of albums do. Every song on this c.d. could be a #1. There is a lot of variety, but nothing lacks from being the best! This isin't a one hit c.d.! It is definately one of the best that I own."
5,Another Great CD From Kenny Chesney.,"This CD Has Great Songs On It Like His Very First Number 1 Hit ""She's Got It All"", ""When I Close My Eyes"" Which Also Appaers On The ""Me & You"" Album, ""A Chance"" And ""That's Why I'm Here"". This CD Is Also A Must Have."
5,WHAT AN EXCELLENT CD!,"This CD is wonderful! Kenny Chesney is a very good singer, and also his concerts are excellent (I went to one over the summer)! On this CD ""I Will Stand"", my favorite song is That's Why I'm Here. Other excellent songs on the album are She's Got It All, She Gets That Way, From Hillbilly Heaven To Honky Tonk Hell, and Lonely Needin' Lovin'. All the rest of the songs on the album are also good. There are absolutely NO bad songs on this CD. This is one of the best CDs I own! Buy it today. It's a must have for every country music fan!"
4,Very nice transfers but NO information!,"This is a wonderful collection of naughty blues, and the audio quality is EXCELLENT, considering the source material they had to work with. But: Inquiring minds want to know at least a little background on the artist, the tune, or at least, the year in which it was recorded. All I got was an ad for a T-Shirt. You'll be loving this collection, but you'll be Googling all the way! Highly recommended!"
2,Soundtrack is scratchy,"I know these are old recording that were most likely made with home recording units. The vocals are lost behind the background noise. I would have liked to have seen these digitally remastered (we have the technology) and then released. Yes, the quality would still sound like an old recording (that is expected) but now you could at least appreciate the piano riffs, bass runs and most importantly make out what the signer is signing. Disappointed."
3,Strange But Wonderful,"I can't tell. Is this love or confusion? Many different styles and ages are presented in this strange four CD set. Some songs start off mid song, some just stop, some taken from other cd's and some I can't distinguish if Jimi is really there. But hell, it's got some nice rarities and different versions of songs live so it's worth the 20 bucks."
1,should be illegal,"Please dont promote substandard music related with the name of Jimi Hendrix associatted with producer Ed Chalpin. It is downright criminal. Jimi would be suing all these people if he was alive. He even asked Ed Chalpin while he was doing some of these rehearsal sessions. ""your'e not going to release this are you?"" in which Chalpins response was "".. no way Jimi.. are you kidding?"". Well why is so much of this crapp allowed on the market? Somebody should do something about it.!!!!!!!!"
4,Nice little gadget,"I'm new to guitar playing and bought this to help tune my guitar. The additional features were a plus that pushed me to buy this particular model. For aprx. $30 dollars getting a 5000 chord dictionary, a metronome and tuner was a good deal. The tuner works effectively and I've checked it against other tuners and it does a good job. The backlighting is good but you need to hold the device at the right angle to see what is displayed. The instructions aren't great but you'll get the hang of the buttons by reading what is offered. The metronome works well and helps you keep the beat or practice keeping the beat. The overall workmanship is ok but could be a bit tougher. The buttons feel firm and responsive. Overall, I'm satisified."
3,It's OK for a multi-purpose device.,"The construction of this tuner is fine but it does need to be closer to the guitar to function well and it still oscillates slightly even with the string in tune. The metronome is a beep style, not the option I prefer, but it works. The chord library is a nice feature, but that's not the reason I bought it. The one thing I really don't like about this device is that you cannot adjust the volume and it is relatively loud when I am practicing in a quiet environment."
3,Good for some things; not so good for others,"This is an excellent chord finder and an OK metronome, but the tuner leaves a lot to be desired. You do NOT want this to be the only tuner in your setup."
2,Disappointed,"I don't care for this tuner. I have not, however, used the metronome or chord finder. The tuner is a lighted display, and the light jumps back and forth from sharp to flat when you are trying to tune a string, so you don't know which way to go. No matter how long I tune a string, I often can't get the light to stay on solid green, meaning that the string is in tune. I had a cheap Seiko tuner that I gave away that worked great."
3,So so,"Chord master mode is quite cool but the microphone tuner is not good at all. Jack tuner works fine. Metronome is just right.You get what you pay here. Led light is not as bright as you could expect specially for a gig. Good stuff for beginners, otherwise go for something better."
2,good for knowing chords BUT smartphone app MUCH more accurate tuner than this!,"Bought mine off Amazon. Good for learning chords you never knew existed.BUT, There's guitar tuner apps that's WAY SO MUCH MORE ACCURATE! There is no moreneed for such items as this tuner for people who own a smartphone ....Dont even think about tuning [attenuation] with this tuner,it's not that accuarate & stable for that.This item developed a poor battery connection after a short time,making the user have to tap, spin, re-install batteries etc...everytime it is used.I found several free Android apps that made my Samsung Fascinate phonea MUCH MUCH AMAZINGLY more accurate tuner!"
4,Planet waves CTM,"As just about everyone else has said - The chord master is excellent - I love the metronome - but the tuner is poor, it's quite difficult to use because it bounces all over the place. But I still really like this unit because of the metronome and chord master. My guitar and my amp both have a built in tuner so that part was not important to me."
2,Wrong Voices is More Like It,"I don't know about every song, but at least a great majority of these are not the originals. ""I've Never Been to Me,"" which is a famous 80's song by Charlene, is especially horrible-sounding on here. Some of these are good, but you shouldn't buy this if you are a purist and need only original recordings."
4,History Through Humor,"We were given this book as a hand-me-down. Like the title states it's ""Horrible"", however my 7 year old is reading about early American history and cannot put it down. I think this will aid him in school when learning the textbook version of events because he has another, humorous, context to associate it with. We plan to buy many more from this series."
2,Down on Americans,"I usually really like the Horrible History books, but this one started out by saying that American History is even more horrible than most. We've had our checkered past to be sure, but I felt there was a real anti American bias in this book."
5,Dancing shoes for the soul,"This is great, as are all her previous albums. If you like James Asher or Professor Trance, you will love this. If you have not idea who these folks are, but you want earthy primal rhythmic music to move you, you will still love this."
3,Its okay,"I love Gabrielle Roth, but this CD is mostly redundent music: extensions of the same piece. It is very repetitive."
3,Not to into the whole clone thing...,"I have read every J.D. Robb book up to this point and have really enjoyed getting to know the cast of characters, etc.I tried to read this book twice and finally forced myself to get through it. The book itself is well written, but the topic of clones and the amount of time devoted to discovering just what the Icove's were up to and the big reveal kind of fell flat when I figured out from the prologue that clones were what we were dealing with.I just wasn't impressed, although the ending rocked in typical Robb fashion that had me speeding towards the final pages with a fervor that I wished had been present throughout the whole book.In my opinion one crappy book out of so many is really good, I'll definately read the rest of the books as they come out. I just don't get into Clones."
2,Needs massive editing,"This book should have been edited to approximately 1/3 of its size. So much impotent verbage and dialogue. I found myself becoming a master speed reader, slowing only occasionally for a rare pithy paragraph. It was a relief to reach the end of this time waster. Skip this one, and I do not send thanks to Nora Roberts."
4,Good,"This book was better than the last. It is more Sci-Fi than the others but I liked that aspect of it. I had wished that we saw Thanksgiving Dinner and who came to it. I felt cheated in that area.I liked how the investigation moved. I liked that Eve was back to herself as well as the other members of the gang.The only issue that I have with this book, and is now more of an industry problem, is that I don't think that this book was Harcover material. It was a bit over priced."
4,Enjoyed this one...,"This was a good addition to the series, with a riveting ending. The romance wasn't the focus as much as the mystery this time, with a chilling plot (way too believable with the advances in cloning technology). There was less focus on secondary characters (except where Mira and Eve went head-to-head a couple of times), and a little more focus on family issues and Eve's continuing struggle with her past and how it effects her job. Roarke, as usual, was an integral part of the investigation. As another reviewer mentioned, I wish we could've been a part of the family dinner that Roarke was stressing about throughout the book. If that was included, it would've probably earned another star from me. :) Overall, a good read - worth the time!"
2,A disappointment,"I am an avid reader of JD Robb but this book left me flat. Storyline, dialogue, character development were all below standard for her others in this series. Hopefully, this is a fluke."
1,MP3 CD Doesn't Work In CD Play in Automobile,"5 stars for the book, 1 star for the MP3 CD.I purchased the unabridged CD not realizing it won't work in my car CD player. I buy the book to read and the CD so my husband can listen to it with me when we travel.I think the listing should clearly state that the MP3 Unabridged CD won't work unless you have MP3 capabilities on your CD player. Also, an unabridged CD should be offered that is not MP3."
5,Still Loving Eve,Great series. Can't put them down. I'm going to have to find another hobby when I'm done reading this series.
4,A Good Story,"As usual, Nora has done it again. ""Origin in Death"" is a captivating and stimulating story regarding the subject of cloning. Eve's latest assignment is to track down the root of this evil and end the craziness. The usual supporting cast is there to help her along the way and some very interesting moments come about when Roarke decides to invite his family from Ireland for Thanksgiving dinner. Also, Eve's ""moment"" with Dr. Mira and their little altercation during the ""hunt"" was played out very well. Dr. Mira is a stand-up person and knows how to handle the brashness that Eve dishes out to everyone. Mira knows how to stand up to Eve and at the same time let Eve know how much she cares for her. The simulated mother-daughter relationship is definitely something I would like to see developed further throughout the series.I have now completed the series and look forward to the next book. I highly recommend ""Origin in Death"" to all mystery/murder/sci-fi fans."
4,Imaginative,"J.D. Robb never fails to entertain. This book doesn't disappoint. I love the futuristic settings and the characters, Eve, Peabody, Roarke, etc. are well defined and come alive. Origin in Death, set in the reconstructive and cosmetic surgery industry, is innovative, surprising and most of all, entertaining."
4,A very good read.,"I freely admit I love this series. There are wonderful relationships, humor, great dialogue, a well-done sense of time and place, a bit of passion and excellent suspense. I also feel her books are becoming less romantic suspense and more mystery. It's still there, but this had shades of Robin Cook or Tess Gerritsen. For me, it was a very good read."
5,Excellent!,I hid my TV cables behind the wall within minutes using this tool. I was cutting my drywall like a piece of cake (literally).
4,great for drywall - don't try to use for other materials,"I purchased this saw as part of a bathroom remodel project. It's terrific in drywall, requires very little effort, cuts aggressively and smoothly, and I couldn't be happier with it for that purpose.However, the saw tends to flex more than I'd like when jabbing through drywall, and I actually bent the blade a little, which causes it to bind when cutting drywall sheets now.I also tried to use the knife to cut some cutouts in a stud I needed to fit an electrical box into, and it was a less than successful exercise.Bottom line - if you're cutting sheets in preparation for hanging, this is your saw. If you're looking for a jab saw, you might consider some other options."
2,Really confused...,Looked good when first received. Nasty looking double set of teeth. Tried on cardboard box. It didn't cut well! I was shocked. My comparison was a serrated knife (a small Spyderco folder) that has less leverage but went through like butter. This one struggled a bit and we sent back.
3,Expensive but only marginally effective,This is an expensive product. It's easy to use and apply and initially it appeared to work but within two weeks the deer were back and finished off the flowers. So much for that...
5,A wonderful recipe book and menu section!,"My family is eating Omega-3 fatty acid rich foods now! It's been one year since we read this book. We have less intestinal upset and less diarrhea. The recipes are delicious and I learned so much about ""good fat"" and why our bodies need it. We have come to look forward to nights when our dinners will be something from the recipes pages of this book. It really has enhanced our eating as well as our health. I recommend it to everyone I know.... as I do eating walnuts & salmon now!"
4,"Great information, few recipes","Like many other reviewers, I, too, found the information to be persuasive and fascinating. I've started cooking differently as a result of reading this book. Their are a few good recipes in there, too, (espcially the yogurt chicken) but it's not meant to be a recipe book."
3,Nothing special,"Nothing contained in the book that hasn't already been printed about food and etc. They advocate Canola Oil over Olive and that is the first I ever read that. Other than that I wouldn't recommend to purchase it.I have Lupus and was looking for a cleaner, something different daily eat book."
3,Combines scientific evidence with simple diet plan.,"It's a great book in that you don't have to be a biochemist to understand the scientific evidences provided. Its simplified diet plan is a real winner! If I may point out a typo, on page 349, both linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid are presented as 17-C FA's and with two H-atoms missing on one of the carbons. S.Kitessa"
3,the omega diet,"this book was interesting,but I was disappointed in the lay out and understanding of it, I had struggled thru it and feel there is excellant help just needed better explanation Hmseler"
4,interesting,"Some of the information in the book was a bit confusing. Overall, it was a fairly helpful book."
4,This is a BIG tool box,"I would recommend getting out your tape measure and understanding how bit this is...to me the picture did not portray exactly what a monster you are getting. That being said, I like the removeable small bits carriers on the top. If you have extra long tools, this is a great choice. I have not loaded this heavy yet though so can't say how well the handle will hold since this is a big box with lots of room to store stuff."
3,Okay First Harness,"This was the first harness I bought, and it's just fine. Solid, easy to put on, etc. My problem with it is that, lacking leg loops that hold your weight via the legs, it becomes very painful to hang in over a long period of time. So I now prefer a harness with leg loops that hold my weight and a bit more padding. It's as simple as that."
3,"Made for speed, not for comfort","As the title states, if you are unaware of this type of design, here's a quick heads up. This is an alpine style harness. The leg loop is connected to the waist band and pulled back up to the waist band in a loop. There is no padding at all. Short explanation of what happens is that this is for light-weight, speed of climbing, and for safety. Should you take a fall or need to sit in it at your full weight, you will realise this very quickly as your ""business"" will possibly get a pinch or at the least put a dent in your bottom. This is a nice piece of inexpensive safety gear and as long as you are not using this to sit around all day redoing bolts in a big wall will work just fine. The clip style leg loops make getting in and out of this one pretty easy, even over bulky clothing since you don't have to ""climb"" into this rig. Good, solid product. Just don't hang dog in it."
2,"Looks alright, but def problems.","I bought this with the intention to use it at a rock climbing gym, however, upon getting it, i noticed that there is no belay loop. I really wish the description was more clear when I was buying it. To keep this short, I'm returning it.For those who don't know what a belay look is, this would provide some information; [...]"
2,Not up to current standards,"I bought this harness like most people do because it was the cheapest available on Amazon. I personally thought it worked fine (if just a little weird) until I experienced my first serious crash with it. Because it lacks the belay loop in the middle--a strong loop usually in a bright color right in the middle of the crotch, in case you want to compare to other harnesses--there is no fixture in the harness to prevent your body from spinning to one side while in a serious fall. I wound up landing with my belay partner several feet above me, which does happen in rock climbing, but on my side and out of control. The rock gym people then told me that I wasn't allowed to use this type of ""Bod"" harness and gave me a loaner.So in toto, I think it's a harness that does the job, but does have some risk involved and probably won't be acceptable to your local rock gym. Sorry-- gotta spring for the harness that's 10$ more."
3,Good Questions but not sorted,"Sure this book has tons of great USMLE type questions, and doing questions will help cement the key facts that you learn while studying for boards. However, this book is just a series of 17 entire practice exams. The questions are NOT organized into topics which I found to be key to studying (this is why so many students spend $$$ for the Kaplan QBank because you can choose questions that you just studied that day). Its hard, frustrating, and low yield to do questions if you have not studied the topic yet. I only recommend using this book when you have completely mastered all the subject topics of the USMLE."
4,Got me through the class,I purchased this book for school. It was used but in excellent shape as described. I'm happy with the book.
2,Very basic book on art,"I can not believe that a book that retails for over $30 on 'perceiving art"" presents its art examples in black and white form. The descriptions of how to perceive art were given at a very superficial level. I could have just gone to the internet and found the info presented in this book, which is what I did do in order to pass my writing assignment. The book was not a total waste, however. I will resell it to another student taking the same class and recoup some of my lost money."
3,Color Insert?,"I was surprised that this expensive textbook was not full-color and I got the impression the author was too. In his discussions he references color regardless of whether the work is contained in the color insert. The images, being both small and colorless, also make it difficult to observe some aspects of the techniques they are included to represent. A small selection of images are printed large and in color but those are separated from relevant context and placed in one of two color inserts. Flipping from text to view an image and back is annoying, especially when comparing multiple works. The color theory section was particularly absurd without any color. Despite the visual failings, the information contained within the text is in-depth, covers a broad range of topics, and is mostly informative. My school uses this text in combination with other resources and students unfamiliar with the arts will want to do so as well."
5,just what the seller said it was,the book was exactly what was described and it was shipped fast. would buy from this seller again.
3,It's a required school book,"The book was in good condition, but it was a book that I had to purchase for school. So far has been an interesting read :)"
1,damaged book,I was over all pleased with my purchase but i recieved a torn and damaged book. I was not happy.
1,Don't be fooled.,"While it may be new, the device is junk. The frequency, amplitude and phase adjustments are not in ""real time"", that is, when you turn the knob, the digits do NOT follow you as you turn it. There is a significant time lag which makes it particularly difficult to zero in on a particular value. More over, the device is very light and cheaply made. I don't think that you could give it away to others once they see how it functions. That said, if you don't care about what value of frequency, amplitude or phase, or are only interested in very ball park values, this may work for you. The output signal does not seem to be bad as measured on an oscilloscope. It's the usability that is of concern."
3,Heavy industrial/Death Metal,"Don't believe the guy below me that says these guys are Mortician sound-alikes. I really have no idea where he got that from. This is industrial metal with a strong death influence, sounding alot like Fear Factory's ""Soul of a New Machine"". I wouldn't quite rate it on the same caliber as that album but it still is a very solid album. There isn't much variation between the songs, but the musicians are tight and they play pretty heavy. Not a ground breaking release, but definitely worth checking out for fans of FF, Prophecy, and maybe even newer Ministry."
2,The Novelty wears out quickly in the field,"Overall, I would think this item is way overpriced for the quality of the tool I received. I work in retail grocery for a living doing overnight stock so I know the value of a really sharp knife, and believe me, that blade is NOT sharp. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the blade as only being a 4 in sharpness when right out of the box and after only a month of use cutting open plastic wrappings and tape from theovernight stock cases it has almost dulled down to a common butter knife. Plus I needed a screwdriver to open the knife to put in the utility blade. Its a good thing Ican figure out instructions by following diagrams, someone who is not used to figuring things out for themselves may have been really frustrated. My suggestionwould be unless you really need to have two knives in one you would be better offpurchasing a cheap utility and clip knife separately you can get at your average bar-gain store for $5.00 or less a piece."
5,Fantastic,This cd is fantastic! I am forever baffled by why people have made britney and christina so popular. Well I think Robyn is ten times better than them. I love this cd. It is really original and fresh music!
1,Not for me but you might like it .........,"Good voice but the singing style is very distinctive. I guess you either love it and can't get enough, or listening for more than a few minutes just drives you nuts."
3,Good CD,"I got this for ""Show Me Love"", but there are several other songs that are great on the CD too. Yes, not all of them are great, but about half. Overall, I really enjoy it!"
5,Robyn Is Here&#65533; I Like It!!!,"You'd be a fool to dismiss this fine debut CD just because it's ""another pop princess"". But if you look past the tired genre, you'll find a very talented, vocally rich and likeable singer in Robyn, who has 3 Top 10 singles. Her voice, right off the bat, will stun you. She's Swedish, but sounds like a legitimate R&B/soul diva, a la Diana Ross or Toni Braxton. She's incredible. Her songs border on irrestistibly catchy to amazingly heart-felt, and they all pack a punch. I reccommend this to anyone looking for a fine album. I heard she's releasing a sophomore effort soon... I can't wait."
5,Great CD!!! :),"This is one of my faves! Robyn is so talented! ""I Wish"" is my favorite song on tha CD."
2,Robyn WAS here...I'm not so sure that she would stand out today though...,"The Last Time sounds good. Kinda mellow and laid back.Of course Show Me Love is a hit. As well as Do You Know (What It Takes) but to an even bigger extent.Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect) is OK, but nothing spectacular or new. Robyn Is Here is kinda just...well...corny. Not super corny, but it is what it is.I Wish (A Capella) could've been cut completely. Not really feeling it.Do You Know (What It Takes)The Last TimeShow Me Loveare the only good songs really. Robyn has a pleasant enough voice but she doesn't get the right material. Skip this. If you missed it, you didn't miss much.Ciao."
3,Doesn't Quite Measure Up to the Pop Princesses,"The good thing about Robyn is that she writes her own music (or at least co-writes it).The bad thing is that most of the music she writes is nowhere near as catchy as anything by Britney, Christina, and the whole pop princess bunch.You've already heard her best stuff (""Show Me Love,"" ""Do You Know What It Takes"") as singles a few years back. There are also a few gems hidden on this CD, such as ""Do You Really Want Me,"" but the few good songs get lost in the muddle of the not-so-good ones."
3,"Umm, O-K, hmmmm","Well I don't like many of her songs, so umm, Oh I can't wait 2 goto her concert!!! I like Bumpy Ride though!!! email me!! ~Emily (*pLaTiNum Chic*)"
1,Flat&boring,she came out before Britney&the other Lames out now.big deal.mindless Music&lyrics.very run of the mill and SoulLess.
1,Amazon plays wiki catalog with merchants pictures,"I bought this item twice and received the wrong item each time, thru no fault of the merchant. Amazon merged the incorect listings A 4 hole commercial stop with a 3 hole wood door stop. Creating a bad customer and merchant experience when the wrong product was delivered. Shame on you Amazon, quit playing constantly changing wiki products."
5,Depressing Story but overall good book!!,"This is the best book I have evr read. It is sad when Alicia dies, but i just love the book. You can feel Desi's pain that she felt. Very great book!!"
5,Amazing! One of her best books yet!,"This book touched me. It was such a sad, but realistic story. I think that that is so incredibly heartwrenching when an inoccent baby is stricken with a fatal disease. I stayed up way past midnight trying to finish this book. It was incredible!"
3,Pretty good,"This book was good, but I've read better from McDaniel. I don't believe I would want to read it again, but it was pretty good."
3,"HIV?!? Desi, you really want to work with AIDS babies?","Baby Alicia is dying is an awesome book. Desi, a scientific genius has an aunt who takes her to ChildCare, a place where a HIV positive baby who's mother can't take care of the baby, herself because of HIV lives. Desi favors a little baby named Alicia, who's beauty and charm overwhelms her. This isn't the best of Lurlene McDaniel, but I still encourage you to buy it."
2,Oh No,"This book is crap. Crap! Crap, crap, crap, crap, CRAAAAAP!!! Okay, maybe not crap. But really dang close. I love most of Lurlene McDaniel's books. But this is bad. And sad and depressing and OMG its just CRAP!!! I couldn't even finish it. But most of her books are good. I just don't get how someone can enjoy reading a book about a dying baby. It just made me terribly sad and depressed. Don't buy it. You'll cry."
5,This is most likely the best book I've ever read.,"This is a great book everyone should read it! Desi is growing up,going to a new school,and wanting to do new things.Although her mother is against it Desi starts working at ChildCare,a place where HIV positive children stay if their parents give them up.She falls head over heels for a five month old little girl and starts spending more and more of her time at ChildCare.When the child takes a turn for the worse....But you'll have to read the book to find out the rest!It's a wonderful,woderful book I give it five stars."
5,I thought this book was absolutly wonderful. I loved it.,"This was an extra-ordinary book. it was fantastic. It was also sad in the end. I cried every time I read, and I read it alot. I would reccomend this book to any one who could hack a sad story."
2,Amazing but Quirky,"This is some pretty amazing technology. The image quality is fine. The LP mode is remarkable and I'll be darned if I can see much difference between LP, SP, and XP. I'm watching this on a Toshiba 27"" with RCA connectors, so there may be some artifacts that aren't obvious to me. The EP mode is very soft and generally unacceptable for archiving anything. This machine is not without problems though.It does occasionally ""freeze"", requiring a forced ""restart"". I also found yesterday that it refused to finalize a particular DVD-R. The disc plays fine on the unit but when you try to finalize it...nothing. Strange. I also found something even more troubling.After erasing a program on a Panasonic DVD-RAM disc, I recorded another program. Upon watching it, the image became jumpy at one point with some heavy artifacting. Then out of the blocky mess I could see images from the erased program! Is Panasonic allowing beta versions of these things out or what?!"
5,Great VHS Replacement; Great TiVo Alternative,"This is a great, easy-to-use machine. It's always scary to buy something big like a new electonic device. I read mixed reviews on this product, but decided the price / benefits outweighed the negative comments. I am extremely happy. So the product does not contain a hard drive... it's okay. Panasonic includes a DVD-RAM. I didn't know what this was at first, but it's like a hard drive on a CD. Use it. You can record several different programs on the same disk. Use the cool VCR Plus feature to record your programs - it's super easy. The player takes you to a screen where you can skip to whatever recording you wish to view, then simply press ""enter."" It's the easiest and coolest thing ever. And you can re-record the DVD-RAMs thousands of times. Yes, this is a cool product. I highly recommend it for anyone breaking away from VHS, and anyone too cheap (like me) to buy TiVo."
1,Try again Panasonic,"I bought this at Best Buy and had to bring it back after the first week because the clock stopped keeping the correct time. The second one had the same problem. I updated the firmware from the Panasonic web site, but the problem persisted. This one's going back too. The other problem is unless you are using costly DVD-RAM disks, you can't choose where to put chapters and can't title chapters. I'd shell out the money for the DVD-RAM but those won't play on other machines. I think I'll wait for the technology to improve on these recorders before I try again."
4,A Good Unit,"The Panasonic is a good value recorder. It's on-screen guide is easy to use and helpful. Even the Panasonic toll free number, into Chesapeake Virginia, was helpul in setting up. The recording quality is very good in both the 2 hour and 4 hours mode; and works fine with SONY DV-RW and the RAM disk. I bought a SONY at first which toted recording all formats, but at another $100, why i asked. I decided to take it back in favor of the Panasonic. I do wish the remote had a better way of fast forwarding through commericals, like a ""plus 30 second"" feature. Overall, I'd recommend this recorder as a good value."
3,Good but not great.,"Over all I'm happy with the performance of this item. But I have had the occasional DVD that will not finalize. This can cause the player to ""freeze."" I cant get the player to perform any other functions such as going back to the menu. I have to unplug it and start over."
4,Panasonic DMR-ES20K DVD Recorder Black,This is one of the best Panasonic had made. It is made in Singapore and very good quality unlike Made in China products. It has fast play for new DVDs... very user friendly and works like a charm. All the features are excellent. I highly recommend it. Also had DV input for your Mini DV camcorder. This is great!
1,Obsolete and Unreliable,"This machine worked okay at first, but quickly started developing quirky problems. Various features, one by one, started failing.While the machine was still under warranty, I called the manufacturer. The representative was quite dismissive, and sent me a CD with ""fixes."" Apparently, the problems were common.For a while longer, the machine was working okay, but then I found that I had to unplug it and reset everything every couple of months... then every couple of weeks... now daily. If I don't, it ignores any programming and also stops responding to any of the controls on the remote or the front panel. Thanks, Panasonic.This DVR just isn't worth purchasing at any price."
2,Basically Sucks,"I've had this recorder for over a year now. Within the first three months, the power supply went bad and screwed up the whole recorder. I had to get the whole board replaced, although it was under warranty. The operation of the unit is flaky. Sometimes it just freezes up and you have to unplug it. The player finalizes discs only half the time I try, so I only use it to watch DVDs. On that regard it is pretty good, except that for some reason it doesn't have a time remaining function for either the track or the disc. It is so frustrating I want to shout! If this is in the machine, please someone, post a review letting me know how to do it."
1,Save your money,"We purchased this last April and have had nothing but problems. We have not been able to record on it for the last 5 months. It does play DVD's, but when you first put a DVD in, it takes 'forever' to read it before it ever starts playing. Also when it was recording - it won't even let me watch the DVD's that it recorded. I do have to clean it 'often' in order to just watch DVD's.I have an old (approx 10yrs old) DVD player and have never had any problems with it. - Warning DON'T BUY"
2,Not for MAC owners,"We got this player to hook up to TIVO and DirecTV and to playback store DVD's and home DVDs created on a mac. The player insists on setting up local channels everytime you turn it on until it is successful tuning in your channels. Since we are using it with tivo and directv, the player can not find any channels to synch. You can not seem to bypass this 'feature' This is pretty annoying.We also had to send the first one back to Cabo Wabo since it was defective. (Cabo Wabo was GREAT with the exchange! Please do business with them.)As for DVD playback, the box box does NOT like DVD's created with OS X. It will not play DVD-R or DVD+r disks finalized with a MAC. I have had some luck with disks burned on a PC. [...]"
5,Replaces my VCR and 5 year old dvd player,"Works great! DVD RAM prices are down and with 100,000 writes even when finalized this is the way to make video recordings or to back up your old tapes. I was able to get it to work right away and it is much easier to use than my old broken VCR. It is so small compared to my other non- progressive scan DVD player, but the picture seems to be a bit crisper in resolution. I am very happy with the performance so far. The recordings have higher resolution than VCR tapes and 4 hours on a DVD ram disk is decent. The manual is complete and easy to read. Panasonic has been the best and most reliable brand for me. The other Panasonic unit it replaced is good as new but cannot record."
1,Stay Away From This Recorder,"I thought I had the best DVD Recorder yet, but despite the mostly New Raves over this product, it will stop recording toRegular DVD's when the Warranty runs out, I tried a second oneand got the same results, it won't play anything but DVD-Ram Now!Panasonic also did not send me a $50 Rebate that came with it.They sent me to a web site where it wasn't listed.JMO, This unit is great at first but don't through away Your VCR.Good luck to the rest of You."
3,"Good product, but have problem reading Philips DVD-R disc though","The product is great, easy to use, but by somehow it doesn't read and write on Philips DVD-R disc. Other discs are ok."
1,Very disappointing Panasonic product,"We had this product long enough for the warranty to expire, which is about the same time it stopped working, except for the clock. We missed a lot of shows because this thing would randomly malfunction, sometimes working great, sometimes freezing up completely so that the only way to reset it was to unplug and start over. I've had good experience with Panasonic in the past, so this was an unpleasant surprise. Luckily, our credit card covered the purchase so now we can buy another product, from another company of course.This market is way too competitive for low quality mess like this. Don't waste your money."
3,Poor information about the equipment,"I buy the equipment because the information say it was a multi region, when I tryed it was only region 1 not a multirigion. and is to expencive send this back."
1,DVD Recorder Difficult to Set Up & Use,"This is a very disappointing unit with an attractive finish (silver). I finally got it set up including the VCR Plus codes, but recording and finishing DVDs is a big hassle and not user friendly. Also, the wait on hold for tech support with Panasonic can exceed 52 minutes (which I've experienced). This unit does not let you record a DVD and watch another program on your TV at the same time.If you seek frustration and like to spend endless hours setting up new equipment, poring over manuals and waiting in a long phone queue to speak with tech support and then still not knowing why your remote control (the one Panasonic provides) doesn't respond to commands, then this is the unit for you!If you plan to record to watch a TV program at your leisure, I suggest that you stick with the VCR format.I am returning this unit to Amazon.com. Too bad I had to give it one star, but that's as low as it can go."
1,No Password to change settings,Purchased the unit and went to play a childrens DVD and it will not play because the ratings setting will not alow it to play. Attempted to change the ratings setting and was prompted for a password. Have never setup a password and the manual does not list a factory preset password. Turns out the ratings setting will not alow ANY DVDs to play. This is junk! Do not buy. How can I unlock this stupid machine?
1,Far too advanced for the simple minded!!!,"After many hours of experimenting and trying to comprehend the instruction manual on how to record etc ad nauseum, I decided to play a Netflix movie - It won't play because it doesn't have the new Region Code - So BEWARE - if you want to use this as a DVD player in addition to a DVD recorder - you will find it won't play any of the commercial flix unless they are up to date with the Region Code!"
1,Break down quickly,"I used it for a very limited period of time and then because I was busy, I did not touch it for 3 months. Today, I turn it on, it is broken! Maybe a power surge? but every electronics around it is working fine. What a piece of crap! I don't think I will buy Panasonic again"
1,"Firmware has bugs, so forget scheduled recording","On paper, this DVD recorder is a great deal--it has terrific features, a great interface, and a reasonable price. What the sales pitch leaves out is that the firmware (the software that runs the unit) doesn't work. I set up my scheduled recordings and all was fine for a couple of weeks--then I noticed one missed session after another. After sitting on hold with Panasonic tech support for 1 hr+, they told me that a firmware update was available to address this problem. I installed it, but it still does not work. After another 1 hr+ on hold, they get my info just so they can call me back and leave a message to take it to a service center ""because the firmware update should have worked."" What a ripoff! I tried tech support again, this time via e-mail, and their online form doesn't even work (returns a VBScript error). Stay away from this product!!!!!"
2,Unfortunate,Excellent machine except it kept freezing after finalizing a disk forcing me to disconnect the machine in order to get it functioning again so I sent it back.
2,Half A Good Product,"A big part of why we choose this sword was the shoulder sheath. The sheath was cheaply constructed, and after one week the tip pokes out of the end.The sword itself is great. But we're not happy that we can't use the shealth."
5,Fantastic work by a young artist,"Wynton was still in his twenties when he made this album, but he certainly got it right. Terrific solos (by him and other members of the band), fantastic composition, and wonderful production make this an important recording to own. My favorite tune? Melancholia. The shortest tune, yet the one that touches my soul the most."
3,OK,"Tracks don't match up with the actual song when you download to MP3. If you want Jefferson songs, then you should buy."
5,Quasi Stellular Object,I had been looking all over for this I had a copy but someone stole it I also knew the Singer/bass player Greg Acuna but have lost contact with him anyway glad to have found a new copy
5,perfect remote,"this remote control works perfect in my garage door, the one that was stalled before we moved in was working but was draining the battery too fast. I was shock when i found out the amount of that garage door opener. so when we install this opener inside the house it works like a charm, i bought 3 of this opener , one for me, one for my wife, and inside the house."
1,It FRIED my hair,"I bought this pink Chi to feel as if I was doing something for breast cancer awareness, but as they say ""No good deed goes unpunished.""This Chi LITERALLY melted in my hands within the first 5 minutes of use (the glue melted and the gold plates just fell off) and it burnt 2 strands of my hair that eventually had to be cut out."
5,This Collector's Guide Is a Necessary Resource,"Since I am acquiring Girl Scout memorabilia for a display during the Girl Scout Centennial year, 2012, I was advised that this book was something I absolutely had to have. And this was so right! It has proven to be worth to me many times its value, and has saved me from making bad buys several times. You can learn so much from this book. I recommend it to anyone who even has the slightest interest in Girl Scouting."
2,Scary!,"I wasn't worried about much at all until I saw this book. Apparently it's not only the case that pessimism, paranoia and misguided media are very widespread, but we're also heading for disaster! I was vaguely aware of the first three, but wasn't particularly worried about it until this book pointed out the latter. Now I'm battling pessimism and paranoia that I had never known before. Is this book enough to prevent the impending doom? This book is scaring me to death!"
3,Tends to ice up,"The lock tends to ice up and not open, not a lock for the Northeast- unless you only use it in the Summer, works fine then. Oh, plan to loose the little red rubber type water seal, it falls right off if you lightly rub it. Was hoping for a more weather resistant lock."
1,Did not work,This remote control did not work with my Wayne Dalton 303 garage door opener. It was not universal at all and simply returned it.
1,A wishful fantasy,"Even without going outside the covers of The Liberty Incident, a conclusive case can be made for the proposition that this book was written in defense of the official Israeli position. If one goes outside the book to verify facts, the result is that the reader is unable to verify almost none of the facts.Within the book, the author appears to make a conscious effort to obfuscate contrary facts by constantly digressing into wholly irrelevant subjects before returning to the subject under consideration.For True Believers, this book is exactly what you are looking for. For everyone else, it is a complete waste of time."
1,you know it's meaningless when...,"The author fails to interview more than 1/4 of the survivors of the actual incident. That's a very L.B. Johnsonesque manuever: Obfuscate with ""facts"" from impartial sources (not the actual victims of the incident of course, they're too ""emotional and biased"" hence their thoughts are meaningless). Non-partial sources such as Israeli military personnel and top brass will give a non-political, no bs, view of course. It's not like they're worried about promotion or anything! Isn't odd though that LBJ didn't pin Commander McGonagle's Medal of Honor on the White House lawn? It's not like it's an important event, but at least give the guy a break!"
5,the truth about the Liberty,The Judge has done a fabulous job. He has read every word and spoken to everyone possible. His conclusion is 100% correct
1,Bad design,The lid didn't fit on mine either and like the reviewer before me I emailed the company and received no reply. I will never buy a Rival product again.
2,"It's a Crock of something, alright.","I'm here to write my third horrible review of a Rival Crockpot. I've had this for several years, but used it only for special occasions, due to its size. So it's safe to say it was not used heavily or abused.The handle of the lid snapped off the last time I was cooking in it, while the lid was steaming hot. I wasn't surprised, because just a few months ago, this happened to my smaller, newer model as well. My first Crockpot had to be thrown away for throwing sparks and shorting out for no apparent reason.I will not buy a Rival Crockpot again."
2,Broken handle on lid,"I purchashed my crock pot because I liked the one that a friend of mine had. I used it a couple of times everything was great, but then I went to use it for the third time and the handle on the lid broke off. I was very disappointed because I have other smaller crock pots and never have had a problem with them. Now I have this crock pot that I can't even use. I just think that the design of the handle should be better. Now I have to purchase another crock pot just to get the lid."
1,Do not buy ANYTHING Rival!,"After the first use of my Crock Pot, the handle broke off. I called Rival and first she said that the part would be there in 2 weeks. I said that I just read online that is what they are telling everyone else. She then said that they cannot replace the handle, that I need to buy a whole new crock pot. I have read hundreds of complaints online about the same exact problem and horrible customer service."
5,Solid Feeling Strap,"This hand strap only works if you have purchased and use the extended battery pack. There is no place to attach the strap at the bottom of the camera but there is a place to attach the strap if you use the extended, vertical battery pack."
4,A Must have for any serios photogrpher.,"A handstrap is a great addtion to any camera system. You won't believe the stress it will relive from your hand/arm especially when using bigger cameras and/or heavier/longer lesnes.It could be better if the strap was more robust or padded, but still this is great overall."
3,Can't figure this thing out.....,"I bought this hand strap thinking it would be the cat's meow as far as making my camera soooo easy to carry around. UHHUH RIGHTTT.....I'm STILL trying to figure out how to get this strap hooked to my camera and it was bought a month ago. If anybody knows how to hook this strap up, please let me know.A word to the wise....you may need a degree in geniusology to figure out how to install this strap.I'm sure it's a great product IF a person ever get's it hooked to the camera."
2,More trouble than it's worth -- even at under $10 . . .,"This was a pain to install -- and it only ""works"" with the battery pack attached. This is relatively useless in Portrait view as you have to take your hand out, and move it out of the way before you can use the shutter release on the battery pack in Portrait view. Limited usability, it's a pain to install factors make this a waste of any amount of money."
2,Canon Rebel handstrap,It would be much easier to use this strap if instructions were included on how to attach it to the camera. Also some instructions on adjustment to fit your hand would be nice.
2,I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the product.,"I would have thought Canon would have made a better quality product. This feels cheap and seems as though it may come apart very easy. However, I do have to say this is the only product that I purchased from Canon that seems to be of low quality. Everything else is amazing."
3,not for dslrs w/o battery grip,"I was browsing through camera accessories and found this hand strap. I don't favor the neck strap because it gets in the way when taking photos. So I received it as a present and was excited to use it. I opened the package and thought that there was an item missing. How do you attach this to the bottom of the camera? So I found that reading previous reviews, I discovered that this hand strap works with dslrs with the battery grip. I was a little annoyed, but I found other hand straps with the right items to attach it securely to my camera."
3,Very resrictive,"A comfortable hand strap but it only works with the optional opteka or canon battery pack.Very hard to operate camera controls when wearing the strap.Very complicated installation due to poor instructions, Had to google installation instructions to figure it out."
3,BOO!,"I was excited to see that it came in the mail (sooner than expected);but then again, it arrived within 3 days of my purchase.The packaging was very poor. :(The handstrap came with no instructions on how to assemble it to the camera.On the Amazon.com item pictures, another customer uploaded a picture of the instructions- but I did NOT receive them.I am pretty disappointed. It makes me wonder if this product is actually WORTH what I paid for. It's so inconvenient to have to find the instructions elsewhere.Oh well. There's no other customer review to compare to."
3,Can this be used with a tripod mount?,"I'm really thinking of buying this, but I don't have a battery pack, so I know it won't fit. However, I do have a tripod mount that has a loop on the screw. So has anyone had any luck using the hand strap connected to the built in top loop and a tripod mount loop?That may be a cheaper work around than a rather expensive (and heavy) battery grip.I rated 3 stars even though I don't have this. If it works with a tripod mount then it gets 5 stars."
1,receive not the correct items,"I do not recommend this store.They send the items not with the caracteristics of the picture.I needed to write to Amazon to get my money ,store never did it until that.any way I loose the freight cost and the item do not work."
1,Misleading Description,The Description says for ALL EOS cameras and that is NOT TRUE.It will only work with cameras that have the Battery grip installed.Not even sure the camera I have (Rebel XTI) Can use a battery gripMaybe it will look good on the wall but for my needs it is USELESS!!!!!And I have had good luck with Amazon UNTIL NOW!!!
1,Strap REQUIRES battery grip,"Although not an inherent problem with the strap itself, the description does not indicate that a battery grip is REQUIRED to install."
1,Camera strap,This item arrived well before the predicted date. The description did not indicate it was merely a replacement strap for a complete assembly to attach to a camera. Now I on a quest for a the connector piece so I can actually use the strap.
1,The item is definitely not Canon,"The item is a very poor quality strap. Yes, it does fit the Canon t3i, but paying $15 for this is absurd. I just saw one of the pictures posted by a user where he/she clearly indicated the quality differences between the original Canon strap and this version. It should definitely not be advertised as being a Canon strap because it is not."
2,not all that useful,"I have an XTi (400D) with the BG-E3 grip. I bought the handstrap because I wanted to securely hand-carry the camera. (I find the neck strap rather uncomfortable.)The hand strap works fine, but because of the relative geometry of my hand, the camera, and the strap, my fingers end up nowhere near the controls when my hand is securely under the strap. That is, with the strap securely over the back of my hand, my fingers are near the lens, not the camera controls. This is not very workable.A minor issue is that this thing is pretty tricky to tie/untie, and the instructions are in the BG-E3 pamphlet -- the strap does not come with one.Another less minor issue is that the neckstrap and handstrap are connected when tied properly, so it's a hassle to remove one or the other without dealing with both."
4,Hand Strap E1,"Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand...It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap...."
5,Bye bye shoulder strap,"I can't stand using the should strap with my camera primarily because I feel like a dork with it on, but also because if I don't have it around my neck it always seems to get in the way. However my wife is not as sure-handed as we'd like so we always kept it on.To be fair for readers of this review I use this with a battery grip installed on my T3i.The hand strap has solved these issues for both of us. It's comfortable for both even though our hands are dramatically different in size. It makes carrying and controlling the camera much easier and there's never a strap in the way. Then there's the fact that I can securely hold the camera with one hand, always have it at the ready, and most importantly not look like a dork...at least not more than normal!Definitely recommend getting one of these."
2,"For battery pack cameras, also not for big hands.","You should know this is for battery pack and EOS1 cameras only, from the other reviews.Also know that even though I'm just a normally built 6'00 guy I find the strap too small for my hands, to fit at all the strap has to be at maximum length, which means that it is not safe to rely on it holding together (since it uses standard friction-loop connections which are safe only if their is plenty of strap beyond each end of the loop).So if you have biggish hands this is going to be a problem."
1,"You gotta have a battery grip, if you want to use it","I didn't know I should have a battery grip for using this. So if you guys want to use it and do not have a battery grip, don't buy this, otherwise, you should either return this product to the seller or need to buy a battery grip, which seems to me wagging the dog."
4,Good product,Well made reliable product. I always replace the neck straps with a hand strap. Neck straps are generally uncomfortable for me so this if a far more practical way to carry my camera when I'm shooting.
5,Handy for some folks but not for me,"My opinion will probably differ from other reviewers.This strap works well IF you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera.As to be expected, it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots.Personally, I went back to the neck strap because, if using the hand strap, the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down. If you're out roaming around, the neck strap frees your hands up, reducing your fear of dropping the camera, eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and, with the neck strap, the camera is readily available.I have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made.Mark H"
4,Useful,"So far I'm finding this hand strap very useful. When doing a shoot with the 30D+battery pack, you need as much grip on the camera as you can. I've always worried about my camera slipping out of my hands when I working the contorls.Also as others have said, you will need the battery grip in order to use this strap. Also, you will need to have some patience in figuring out how to attach the strap especially if you want to keep your neck strap attached. A better design for both the neck and the hand strap would include a way to snap and unsnap the straps very quickly. After spending about 20 minutes figuring out a way to securely attach the strap, it will be while before I take it off."
5,Very Handy Accessory,"I'm using the Canon 20D with the BG-E2 battery grip (a must in order to utilize this hand-strap) and this is a very nice accessory to have. It not only gives me a much better sense of security with my shooting, but it is very comfortable. Sometimes I use it as a padding for my palm instead of use it as a strap. It's just a GREAT product. Definitely suggest getting it if you have the BG-E2 (or any other) grip attached."
5,Perfect idea,"Having just purchased a battery grip for my 5D, I saw this strap being used by a photographer friend of mine. It is extremely comfortable, makes holding the camera much easier and gives a sure, secure feeling."
3,simple straight forward informative,"Small Business Marketing for Dummies, Second Editionthis book is information about small business marketing at its simplest level. It touches basic information. For people without any knowledge of subject. I found it a helpful."
3,Nice book,"It's a nice book with some good tips. I haven't really had the idea that the book gave me some real new ideas for my business, it's all quite standard."
4,There is no CD included,"The version I received referenced an included CD with excel files. There was no CD enclosed. I returned it and the replacement has no CD, nor does it reference the CD. I guess that at one time a CD was part of this package and they no longer include it. It seems that the book will be helpful without the CD but I was disappointed in the mislabeling.Amazon was outstanding in the return/replacement process even though I didn't get a CD with the book."
3,eternal,"ok, i had a more positive review before this one, but after giving it a true listening, its not the best, or even better than STILLBORN, as i said earlier. the vocalist doesnt ever change tone, at all, and only half the album is catchy. the vocalist is not even at all close to hoffman, but the lyrics are quite good, but once again, not as good as hoffmans. now, the guitair work is quite splendid, and the drumming is excellent, but doesnt change up too much, which can get boring. if you are new to malevolent creation, dont make this your first, and if this is your first, and u dont like it, please keep faith, when they come back with hoffman on ""the fine art of murder"" they come back to their roots, and dominate with true malevolence. peace out..by the way...for the song THEY BREED i take off 2 stars. there is absolutely no need for rascist remarks in heavy metal music. other than that this is a good cd."
3,Good - but difficult to ascertain if it is new,"The battery was delivered pretty quickly and it works fine so far.But it was delivered in an unpacked manner (without any packaging, manual or documents). Thus, it is difficult to ascertain if it is indeed a new battery."
3,Phone Battery,"It is really too soon to review this product. Only time will tell if it was a good deal or not, as only time will determine how long the battery lasts. I wish I could send in a review 2 years from now and then tell you how the product is."
3,Addition to my previous comments,"Look out for Hensley's fourth solo album, which will contain e.g. a new version of my Uriah Heep favorite ""If I had the time"". If it isn't out yet, it should be somewhere in 1999."
3,I wouldn't call that a solo album,"This is a reply to ""valnh@hotmail.com from Sakhalin, Russia""I wouldn't call ""From Time to Time"" a solo album. It's a collection, not a regular record. Neither would I call ""Best of Ken Hensley"" a solo album. What I was referring to was a brand new one, which I was told is coming out soon (if it isn't already out yet)."
3,another book with a recovery theme,"The reviewer who said this book is similar to Infinity Hold got it right. In recovery we talk about making a G-d box. When I describe this book to friends in recovery, I say it is a sword and sorcery where the G-d Box talks back. The scene in the forest is a perfect discription of the 6th step, sometimes they aren't character defects to give up.(""I never told you to sit up"")"
5,"Not the book you want, the book you need","The types of sci-fi/fantasy that I like generally don't focus too much in the details of technology or magic, but rather use it as a tool for explaining some more complex concept.This is one of those books. Masterfully written, it is a complex thinking-person's book that I'm very glad to see back in print!"
5,My Children loved this book !!,"Very cute, unique children's book that all three of my daughters loved. Would highly recommend this book. They can't wait until the rest of the series is available."
3,Don't bother,"""Mad Blunted Jazz"" is awesome. So if you want a DJ Cam CD then buy that one. If you already have that one and want more DJ Cam, then ""Liquid Hip Hop"" will just let you down."
3,"an average, but not boring, band","compared to the pavement music rosters heavy hitting metal bands, headshop is average, but not boring"
5,great ep,Anyone who likes Ben will enjoy this cd. Quite a few good songs you won't find on other albums.
2,stanley chalk line,"I do construction work and have used chalk lines for 45 years, and still do. Stanley makes some good tools. Stanley chalk lines are just about worthless. Does anyone ever try these thing at the chalk lab before they are released to the public? Apparently not. I have tossed many brand new Stanley chalk lines into the woods and when I do, I don't go get them. Save your money. Buy any other brand. I prefer Irwin myself."
4,Can't complain.,"I have been using this chalkline for a couple weeks now and have had no problems so far. The string and hook are heavy-duty and feel like they will last a long time. The box is easy to fill (you can fill it two ways), there is a clear plastic sliding window or you can unscrew the top, and it holds plenty of chalk. I also like that the hook ""locks down"" on the side of the box, cuz I know I hate it when I reach inside my toolbag or belt and the chalkline is hooked to something. The only thing that I would gripe about (and it's minor) is that it is kinda hard to wind it back up, sometimes I feel like I'm going to break the cranker because it is so hard to turn, but once it gets going it seems fine. All in all I think it's a pretty good chalkbox and would recommend it."
2,In Agreement,"I agree with the negative comments already posted:1. The rewind handle is tough to pop out.2. The pin doesn't stay in as well as it should.3. If you load it up with chalk, it tends to jam.4. When loaded you still don't always get good, even distribution of chalk on the line.5. The line is an inexpensive cotton (as most are) and tends to give a ""wide line"" under certain conditions (mostly long snaps).6. It's just too big to fit neatly in a tool belt. Anywhere."
4,"Maybe 3 stars, depending on the your mood...","Mostly improvised the album is saved by the musicianship. Jim Black on drums, Speed on sax/clar., Berne - Wow! I like someparts more than others, but over all - a good effort. Especially for music that is so free from form. If you've liked Berne's other albums, then you will like this one. If you don't - look elsewhere..."
5,Funky!!,"Defintely a great album, but VERY different from the other Acid Lounge offerings - the title, 'goes west,' should be taken literally. WARNING: If you visit www.hedkandi.com, it looks like they've made some mistakes in their track listing for this CD, and it is incorrect. The track listing for this CD on Amazon is CORRECTLY ORDERED."
4,"Shipped on time. Not the casing I expected, but the CD was in great condition!!",Shipped on time. CD in great condition. CD case not what was expected.
5,Excellent Product..Durable and Looks Great!,"Used two cans to do my small two car garage. It was a new home so prep work was easy but, I used the cleaning acid on a couple of small spots and I guess Ididn't rinse it well enough and it left a dull image where the rest shined. My mistake I believe.Anyway, this is a great product. If you drop most anything on it afterwards, clean-up is a breeze.Very happy with product and the outcome.Look around though. I found it for nearly half this price."
2,Coming up where the tires are,"I installed Epoxy Shield in my 3 -car garage one year ago... Looks good, but started coming up where the car tires sit after about 6 mos. Now it is peeling up badly and looks terrible. I applied to a fairly good concrete floor and followed all directions. I can't seem to find if it is OK to just touch up the bad spots or if I need to remove the existing paint and start over. I would strongly consider another product as you would think holding up under car tires (it is a garage floor after all) would be the minimum requirements for this product."
5,Amazing sound!!!,"Package was received in perfect, undamaged condition. I already had one of these hooked up to an alpine mrp-m1000. I added this one along with an alpine mrx-m100 amp. My brother had 4 12"" subs in a car that he owned about 10 years ago. These 2 subs blow that system out of the water. The accuracy of these speakers are amazing. Rated as a SQ speaker, but more of a SQL. Loud enough to make my rear-view mirror face the floor!!!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"DO NOT BUY!! Before buying this sub I did a lot of research on it. Everything I read, said it was a great sub. And while it worked, I agree. I had the speaker for 100 days then the voice coil came loose. Well the seller only has a 90 day warranty. So I contacted Alpine direct. Since this company is not an Authorized Alpine Dealer, Alpine wont touch the speaker. So now I'm stuck with a 40lb paper weight!"
5,Most under noticed artist,"Bertie Higgins is amazing! His music takes you to places many of us have never been. Listening to his powerful voice, you hear his heart and soul. I find it hard to understand why this artist has been so under noticed."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this towel warmer through a Gold Box offer and was eagerly anticipating its arrival. I've had it for a week now, and unfortunately, it is barely warming my towels! And the only place the towel is warm is on the top fold! Maybe I'm doing something wrong - but the rack is good and warm to the touch! Can't decide whether I should return it or not! Help!"
2,Warning: High Operating Temperature,"The towel warmer comes with a bright red warning label which states accurately that: ""This towel warmer operates at high temperatures that can cause burns. Do not touch surfaces of the towel warmer. Do not allow unsupervised children in the vicinity of the towel warmer..."" This warning is not on the website but should be. My adult fingers and knee were nearly burned with a half second contact. I mounted it where a person might inadvertently touch the unit or where children might be near it. I realized the unit was not designed for use in such a place and I returned it. It is advertised as ""great for the entire family"" but it is not."
3,Not as expected,"Only the part of the towel that rest on the top part of the rail is warm. Maybe it dries towel but I was expecting something that just came out of machine cloth dryer. I second the comment made by C. Smith ""nrwgnwd"""
3,Less than design perfect,"We just received our towel warmer yesterday and installed it last night. It seems to work well so far. My biggest complaint is with the design. Two things, first the lower right hand mounting has the electrical wire placed too close to the wall. You have to slide the cheap looking plastic chrome beauty caps over the end of the bar and it cannot go far enough to screw the lower right corner into the wall. Someone didn't think this through. Second there is no place to hang the wire so a nice looking towel rack, ends up looking tacky."
4,Best book to make everyone appreciate and love St. Ignatius,"I have known about the Society of Jesus a long time ago and when I got hold and read this book, the figure behind the Society came into full view. The book is truly inspiring without so much dwelling on the dogmatic aspects of St. Ignatius' spirituality. It is good both as a reference and right reading!"
3,Another ho-hum Venom mini-series,"Ever since Venom reared his ugly head years ago in the pages of Spider-Man, he's starred in so many mini-series' over the years with a few being above average, many so-so, and many more as downright dull. Carnage Unleashed is one of the more so-so Venom stories, but it's better than some of the other comics Venom has starred in (Venom: The Mace anyone?). The story revolves around a video game being made based on Carnage, and Eddie ""Venom"" Brock isn't too happy about the fact that a known murderer is profiting off of something which promotes what he does. Naturally, Carnage soon breaks free of his confines and dukes it out with Venom via digital cyberspace. It sounds ridiculous, oh yes, but the flow of the story has a sort of cartoony feel to it thanks to the usual solid storytelling of Larry Hama. The art is so-so most of the time, but all together this is one of the more average Venom sagas."
1,Goldblatt Trowel Trade Tools GB13300 Pattern Pistol with Compressor,"I was delighted when the shipment arrived earlier than expected. Once I opened the box, I was dismayed to find a bag of parts requiring assembly. One part, the oil reservoir was completely broken. I immediately sent the unit out for repair. Fortunately, the repairman was able to use parts from an old non-working unit to fix the new unit so it is operational. I lost additional time and funds in the process."
2,U.C. Student,"This was our text for Bis. 1C (Winter 98) at U.C. Davis. The book was well illustrated, but was far too in-depth for an intro course. I found lecture notes more useful."
2,DVD Player review - not so great,"There's a red line that goes through the screen when using this DVD player - it is pretty bad, and I wouldn't recommend getting it.Its difficult to pay attention to the movies when you see this red line going through the screen..."
3,Cheaply Made,It does give a very good picture on my HDTV. But it is cheaply made and the remote is the worst junk ever.
3,Okay is about right,"It's a good deal for the money, don't get me wrong but it's tricky to use, labels on the unit are hard to read unless it's at eye level, slow to get started and the remote has small buttons."
3,You get what you pay for,"I guess they had to cut some corners in order to support all the formats they do at this price point. The big annoyance to me is the remote control apparently alternates between two codes each time you press the same button. This makes programming a learning remote to replace it almost impossible. What were they thinking by doing something whacky like that? A minor annoyance is that you have to press the play button at startup in order for the unit to return to the place in the dvd where you powered off.On the plus side, the picture looks good and it has hdmi output."
4,More than you think for a low price,"Review After 3 month of use:Pro:* Extended Divx / Xvid support* USB host 1.1 : you can actually play your divx movies directly from flash drive and even from External Hard Drive. For external hard drive, they must have their own power and formatted FAT 32 (not NTFS).* HDMI / upscale plug - I do not use it so I cannot comment* Multi-region : Just browse the internet to find out how to do....* good support of DVD+RWCon:* Not USB 2.0 : Too slow to play VOB/ Mpeg2 files from usb.* No DTS support* No optical digital output (only coax)* Remote / dvd load sluggish but same as other philips."
4,Plays AVI files,"I had been looking for a player that would play my AVI files. I found this, and not only will it play the AVI videos I've burned to DVD but it will also play them from a USB stick. I love this!My only caveat is you have to use short file names to be able to read the files. Which means I either don't know the order of the video's I'm watching or I have to re-burn everything to short file names. I'm willing to put up with this, cuz hey I CAN watch them.The only other thing I wasn't ecstatic about is the remote, very small button. It could have been designed better."
4,good,"Good product, but you have to read the manual to use it at its full potential. A bit slow when you turn it off. the usb port is a very strong feature."
2,Nice Feature Set but Lousy Remote,"Great features and pretty decent performance, but I had to return two separate units because of the remote control. With the first unit, the remote control died within two days of casual use. Dead as a door nail. I took the entire package back to Best Buy and got a new replacement. Took the replacement home and set it up only to find the remote control in this package was DOA out of the box!!!Yes, I had the batteries installed correctly and I even tried replacing them with two fresh AAA batteries, but still no go.I returned the second unit and got my money back. I'm hoping this was just a bad batch and that Philips will have the problem fixed soon. It is a wonderful DVD player with great features for a very low price, so it's a shame to see something like this make the DVD player virtually unusable."
4,"Philips DVP5960 DVD Player with HDMI, 1080i Upscaling, DivX Ultra, USB direct",Philips DVP5960 DVD Player is a great product; unlike some other DVD players it plays almost all popular formats available.It is really a Great product.
4,"OK, but limited USB Hard-disc support.","I was influenced by the USB connection in buying this player, thinking I could connect my USB hard-disk with downloaded divx video files.Unfortunately, this player does not support the NTFS file system, only FAT16 and FaT32. Also, it only plays wma, mp3, and jpeg files and not mpeg. In short, the USB thing is just a gimmick."
3,Performs well for price.,"I purchased this unit for the USB connection and the low price $60. The reviews I read led me to believe you could use the USB for movies? However the instruction book says only jpeg and mp3 can be downloaded. I tried connecting a flash drive via the USB and it only plays pictures and music - no movies.Perhaps you can connect an external hard drive and play them that way. But I kept the unit because it plays everything I've tried so far. Even short mpg movies on CD-R. The quality looks good on my Philips 42"" HDTV and Original DVD's look Hi-def to me. With the HDMI, setup took only a few minutes."
3,don't count on the USB port,I have this DVD player and the USB port is only a 1.1attaching an external HD using the USB port is hit or miss. most of the time it's a miss. The key to making an external drive is formatting it to FAT32. It does however normally work with a USB key/flashdrive and ipod.upconversion is good when using HDMI cables.
3,Philips DVP5960 DVD Player,Pretty good movie player. Playing a movie DVD folder is not so smooth - slow motion effect with distorted sound.
3,"OK player, but slow.","It's slow to open and close the disc tray. Slow to turn on too. My old VCR turned on instantly. This player needs to ""boot-up"".None of my movies looks any better on this player compared to my old 1999 JVC unit. My favorite movie, ""Santa with Muscles"" would not play at all, yet it play fine on the old JVC, go figure.The slow tray drives me nuts. Hit it Open\Close button and it takes about 10sec before the disc comes out."
3,Love it and hate it,"Rarely has there been a product I so loved and hated at the same time. This device has one MAJOR pro and several MAJOR cons.Pro: USB port! You can stick a flash memory device or even a hard drive into it and access all the files on that device -- including playing DivX movies off it. This is a HUGE positive and the reason for my purchase. But...Cons: 1. Long filenames are NOT supported for that flash/hard drive. 2. No S-Video out for those of us who don't yet have a hi-def TV. 3. Horrible little remote -- few buttons, weak signal, just awful. 4. Flimsy-feeling player.How to rate such a product, with one GREAT feature, several big weaknesses, and a good price? I'll compromise and give it a ""3"". It may just be the cheapest way to get a hard drive's worth of DivX movies over to your TV. But it could have been so much better."
3,Yet To See,"This is perhaps the 11th or 12th DVD players that I have purchased. Each player lasts an average of about 2 years. This is the first Philips player I bought because I had good experience on other Philips brand electronics.The player operates very quietly and offers good output quality. Its durability is yet to be proved by time.However, this unit surely lacks of certain useful functions:(1) It does not have play resumption. Once the ""stop"" button is pressed, the player returns to the beginning of the disk;(2) The unit has no fast forward;(3) I have players in three different rooms and I have a habit to turn off the player completely for energy conservation, even though it means very little. This unit only allows ""play"" and ""standby"" unless it is unplugged.For the price and the easiness of setting to all region operation, it is a worthy buy!"
4,Does what it says,The machine does what it's supposed to and upconverts my regular dvds on my Toshiba Regza. I typically use it to watch movies and have yet to use the USB features or the DivX features. To me those features were just icing on the cake.
3,limited hdmi,hdmi upscaling only no hd componentso if you have only one hdmi imput and have multiple sources like a box and this player you have to choose if you want HD.
1,Not ready for prime time,"Two major problems with this device. First it routinely freezes after pausing a DVD, forcing you to unplug the device and restart. Second, after pausing and trying to resume when it doesn't freeze, the device will not resume where you left off, forcing you to fast forward or jump to the chapter closest to where you paused."
2,Takes forever to turn on before it responds to anything,"This is my first review... and it's for an item I bought a year ago. I was immediately unsatisfied because of how slow to respond this unit is after you turn it on. After a year of regret I'm finally writing my review to express this.It does look nice... But you have to wait 7 seconds for it to even turn on. Doesn't sound like long??--well imagine pushing the power button and counting to 7 before you can hit the eject button because it won't respond to anything. Believe it or not, this is a huge annoyance. Especially weird since the unit looks so hi-tech and nice."
4,"Good quality, Good price","I've owned this dvd player since July 2008 and it's still going strong. I love that it plays Divx movies, plus any media burned to CD or DVD. I use the dvd player about once a week to watch my latest netflix movie and I haven't had a single problem. If you have a 720p set, this is the dvd player for you. It is not blu-ray quality, but it's almost HD quality. Just remember that to get the best picture you have to hook it up through HDMI. Unfortunately the dvd player does not support an audio optical connection (TOSLINK), but that wasn't a problem for me because my amp is about 10 years old and only supports analog. My only issue with the dvd player is that it takes a little too long to load/start up.If you are looking a good quality dvd player that can play pretty much any format, than you should consider this player."
4,Does what I want.,"I bought this because I wanted to be able to play AVI movies from a USB flash card. So far, it does everything I want. The only reason I gave a 4 is the crappy remote. There's nothing particularly wrong with the remote itself, but you really have to point it just right at the unit to get it to work."
1,won't work on all tv's,"if you want 1080i upconvert, don't buy this. the hdmi output is non existing. philips sent a replacement and it was more of the same (snow). technical assistance instructed on how to download upgrade software and the entire unit died. nothing but lights on the display. philips should abandon its dvd player buisness and stick to something simpler... light bulbs!!!!!!After receiving a second replacement, which still didn't work, i tried it on a friends RCA w/ HDMI and it worked fine so i gave him a good deal on it. never a phillips again."
4,Decent DVD Player,"Works well, only complaint is that it takes forever to open the DVD bay sometimes."
2,Stuttering Divx Playback,"This unit seemed like a good deal, but when I received it and tried a Divx (avi) file disc, it played with a video stutter, looking much like the movies of the '20's and '30's that ""jumped"" a bit. The zoom was a nice feature, though rarely used. The DVD playback was good. I was disapointed that there wasn't an S-Video output jack. There was not an ""open-close"" button on the remote, which isn't the most important thing, but it does come in handy. I've had video / audio sync problems with another Philips DVD player using Divx (avi) discs. The reason I like Divx playback capability is that my Digital Camera makes movie files in .avi format, and it's much easier to play on a TV when the DVD player supports the file format. So I returned the unit for a refund credit and bought a Toshiba DVD with Divx support. I've always had good luck with Toshiba DVD players."
3,Rotten Remote,It's a DVD and plays DVDs ... so that's great. Only problem I have is that the remote is very temperamental and only seems to work quite close to the player.
4,Decent for the price,"Pros:- Handles scratched DVDs better than my last one (although still gets stuck on some scratched DVDs).- Good quality picture.- Easy to use remote.Cons:- Very slow in loading up disk.- Remote is weak. Can take a number of button presses to get command.Overall, for the price it's a good unit."
3,Functional DVD Palyer,"It does its job, but I don't like the mirror finish. Don't be fooled by the photos...it is not a silver finish. I also don't like the way it is slightly wider than all of my other components. It is about 1/4 inch wider and it looks odd, throwing off the neat and clean stacked look of my components.The thing I dislike the most about the player was the remote. It is awkwardly shaped and sized. It is also weighted so perfectly when you put batteries in it that it is impossible to pick up in the dark and find the correct buttons (if you like to turn out the lights when you watch movies). You don't know if you have it upside-down unless you look at it."
2,Great if you like Black&White,"Bought this from the Philips on-line store a couple of weeks ago, and have discovered that burned media (like the DivX files it claims to be so great at playing) cause the entire unit--that is, the movie itself, the menu screens, everything--to go to black & white. The customer service people claimed that since it will play commercial DVDs in color, the unit is functioning fine, and had no suggestions. I'm returning mine for a refund, but if you're looking for a DVD player with b&w video output to complement your old-timey gramophone audio, this might be one to consider."
4,Great DVD player,"Does what it says!. Stick your flash drive in the slot, the file list opens, select your file and it plays. No hitches. I give it 4 stars because it lacks a s-video and optical output. Component and coaxial out goes to a receiver with video upconversion to HDMI (Yamaha RXV-2700). What I cannot understand is why only Phillips thought of adding a USB port. The other DVD player manuf. must be napping! Get this player, and no more burning to DVD of divx files. Just get a large flash drive (2Gig and over) and you're good to go."
3,All Purpose DVD,The DVD player gives a crisp clear picture with no poor decompression artifacts (pixilation). The remote control has all necessary functions but is slightly less than intuitive. The USB drive works fine but is a little slow to access. I bought this player to watch fan subs of anime and the player has yet to deliver an episode that I can easily view from the USB. The picture playback function works great though. The firmware i hope is upgradeable for better support of video files. I have seen an identical model on my friends high definition TV running with the HDMI cables and upscaling turned on. Simply beautiful picture. All around a good player but left me wanting in my very specific need.
3,Meet the expectation,"The player do all the jobs I want. However USB transfer really slow and sometimes do not slide to next picture. Other than that, it is OK machine with the price."
3,Not bad.. although mine may be broken.,"I am probably going to have to return mine because my TV will often report a ""no signal"" when I'm using the HDMI connector. Of course, this may be a problem with my TV. However, when it is working, the picture seems to be a big improvement over my old, non upconverting player. I like the fact that it can read both DVD +/- R and has a lot of other formats that it will play, e.g. Divx. And, the USB connector is pretty cool.Dislikes, however, are the aesthetics. I feel like the design would appeal to a 14 year old, but that's it. Also, I would prefer that it were EnergyStar rated, which it is not."
2,Arrogant & A Bad Writer,"Lant uses an effective marketing model, but he is both arrogant and a poor writer. I am pretty tolerant of bad writing, but my copy is still mostly unread. There are many other marketing classics that are readable and contain even better information. I bought this book at a used bookstore, because I have another book from Lant, and was disappointed at that. If you enjoy academic, painfully long sentences then you might be able to get through this book. I have talked to people that do confirm that the author is arrogant, as you can tell by the tone of his writing. If you can get past all of this, then there is some good information in this book. The biggest problem is the tremendous waste of paper and of your time, because of the lack of clarity and conciseness."
3,Jefferey Lant is verbose,"Some people love this guy others hate him. In the past I have participated in one his deck card mailings offering futures investments. His abrasiveness came across at that time and it can easily be found in his writing style. Although this book had some good points and examples, it is buried in so much text that the gems you are looking for are hard to find. Mr. Lant would have done far better had he simply broken the book up into several books.This is a middle of the road book for practicality."
4,Dickey,I am only half way through the book but I find it is a very interesting read. Most of my marketing was wrong. I have begin to implement some of the strategies and waiting to see the results. I will continue to find tune my copy until it is perfected. The book is a great help! I would recommend.
4,Mind opening and stright forward,This is an excellent book if you want to sell your products or services. A must buy.
4,great!,"if you are a pharcyde fan, dj, not a dj, J dilla fan. . this album is a must, beats are from classic pharcyde songs from 3 different albums. cool to just chill out to."
1,More trouble than it is worth,"I regret buying this sensor. The on/off switch gets bumped in a tool belt or box, which starts it beeping, and the only way to keep it from turning on is to pull the battery. The LCD screen is hard to read except from straight on, or in poor light. Although it beeps and shows different icons, it does not discriminate well, and does not pick up edges well. It is bulky and awkward to use on a jobsite. Spend your money on something else."
1,"does a lousy job, waste of money","This stud finder is worthless for finding studs. In my 1926-built house, it finds studs everywhere! The darn thing never shuts up as it beeps away telling me ""Eureka! I found a stud."" NOT! It does work for the wiring but I bought it as a stud finder. So far I've bought three stud finders, all of them duds. Even on a brand new wall which I know had studs every 16"" it still claimed to find them all across the 22' wall."
1,rubbish,"I agree with the other reviewers that this product is useless. Don't buy it. It constantly beeps where there are no studs, which can lead to your hanging a heavy item where there are no studs."
2,the sqeegee fell apart in my hand!!!,"I got my set on Tuesday around 10:00 A.M. and by 7:00 that night the rabbit's foot on the squeegee was falling apart in my hand and the first rubber disc came off and got stuck in the middle of my barrel. Just as previous reviewers say the foot is just to big, when i put it in my barrel i had to wrap it around my hand and pull very hard. The only reason i didn't score this with a one was the swab it is well made and does its job."
2,wow,"I got this new set hoping for a perfectly clean barrel after every play. Soon after i recieved it i realized the ""rabbit's foot"" didnt fit in my barrel and it angered me incredibly bad. I trimmed the stupid cotton off for about twenty minutes, leaving a mess of dust and fabric in the air, and a lot of residue in my barrel. The cotton swab works very well though, and overall the squeege does remove the leftover paint. BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS KIT!!!!"
4,Music Lite,"After reading luke-warm reviews, I went ahead and bought this album anyway. No regrets. It has a lot of cool music that you won't find on typical Mancini compilations. A combo of alternative versions of old standards and obscurities, it's well-suited for cocktails and light conversation. Mancini's a genius, and this gives you a good sense of the depth of his work."
4,Great Mix Here...,"This stands as Mancini's greatest achievement in his end-career stage. The theme song itself haunts you.Justly, it has become a jazz standard, played to great effect by many, many talented jazz musicians.And yet, as memorable as it is, the tune carries a sad sort of feeling in its intensely romantic frame.The movie (itself fairly forgettable) posed a problem for the composer: it's the story of a constantly bickering couple taking a long trip together. How can you back this up with appropriate music?So, many of the tracks seem disconnected, I think because of the inevitably mixed premise we have operating here. Mancini was a thorough professional.But, if you're feeling fancy-free, come wander through this world with me. The unexpected poignancy of this title tune does not, for some reason, make it into the various ""best of"" collections of Mancini's work, and I do not know why. It's one of his all-time best works."
5,"I am a ""Mann's"" man..","..and here I want to assure all fans, that this CD will not disappoint.It is very ""manfred-ish"" though not as progressive as for example ""Solar Fire"". Songs are shorter but melodic and performed with perfect elegance characteristic to this band. Get it."
5,Best Book I Ever Read,My great-grandmother Stella gave me this book when I was 15 years old. I have read the book about 8 times in the last ten years. It is the best book that I have ever read. Very inspiring. All ages would enjoy!
3,It works...but,"Is it worth the price...I'm not sure. One problem I had was that the remover adds quite a bit of width, and the lock that I was removing secure screws from was beveled near the screw, so it made it difficult still. Can't believe how expensive they are, and if I had to do it again - I might try one of the other methods of removal first."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I ordered this book. If you're planning on leaving society to go live in the back country, this is a decent book to have for some conveniences. This is not a book for people wanting to learn how to live off the land if they had to."
3,wilderness living and... survival?!,"Sure, this book claims to teaches you how to do a a lot of things to survive, except one thing: it doesn't teach you how to string up a log into the trees, so that when someone walks by and unwittingly pulls a trigger, the log comes swinging down and crushes them - like what Arnold Schwarzenegger did to Predator. I haven't yet figured out how a single person can do this, unless you're using a complex lever and pulley system. Anyways, you've really got to fortify some kind of defense if you want to survive, and at least encircle your lair with punji pits."
4,Outstanding Book,"I learned A LOT from his books, they offered a tremendous wealth of information for any wilderness enthusiast. It teaches you how to skin a deer, preserve the meat, build a shelter, start fires, and much more.However, the book could have added more depth. They only covered certain chapters with a page and barely discussed certain topics."
2,Stanley tape measure,"Got it, didnt last long and broke. Not sure if I will give Stanley another chance or not. At least they have decent warranties."
1,doesnt work,my dog hated the scent and it did not work at all. dont waste your money on this product. it smells like rubbing alcohol. i bought it 1.5 yrs ago and i have more than 3/4 of the bottle left.
2,Nothing special,"No problem with the order or delivery - everything went smooth. The product effectively worked for about a day or so, then our pup pretty much ignored it after that. Odd as it seems, using it sparingingly seemed to work better than using it daily."
3,Dap Spray,"I'm not sure if this stuff works. I spray it on a handkercheif and tie it around my dog's neck. He still pants and tries to climb up my head when he hears loud booms from thunder, the Marine Base nearby or fireworks. Poor guy."
1,Comfort Zone DAP,I had heard from friends that it works with their dogs but it did not help mine. He simply panted and shook with the 'sprayed' bandana around his neck. I wish it would have worked. I could look forward to some sleep during thunderstorms.
2,Speakers glue on membrane loosens very quickly,"Really wonderfull and awesome sounding speakers!but after a month or 6 the glue will loosen of an inner membrane, causing a buzzing sound to be heard.I found it a pitty and bought a second set. But the same happened on the second set.I tried contacting Sony customer support many times, but with no success.Buy this item if you want speakers that will sound good, and only need to last for about 6 months."
5,Sunday School Attendance Boosters: 165 Fress and New Ideas,"Great book, I have implemented some of the ideas already in our Church and the children love it."
2,165 Ideas Is Misleading,"I had great expectations that this book would give me new ideas for my first grade Sunday School class, but I was sorely disappointed. Don't be fooled by the 165 ideas, it only has a few ideas appropriate for each age level and most were not new to me. If you are new to children's Sunday School you may find this book helpful, but if you are a seasoned veteran, save your money."
3,Starts well but ends with a wimper,This had a good plotline about Dana coming home to investigate her parents death from 20 years ago. However the plot gets sidetracked with an extremely quick romance between her and Tyler Cole - after meeting he proposes after 2 weeks!!!!! By the 6th week she is pregnant her parents death is solved - The End. I know realism is not a major part of this genre but a when a plot is totally unrealistic it makes one rolls ones eyes. I expected a stronger drama for the son of Martin and Parris Cole
5,Homecoming,"I am reading this book now, thus far I haven't been disappointed. Rochelle Alers books always have happy endings. It amazing how her stories unfold and keeps you interested to see what happen next."
3,"""The Doctor's In""","The chemistry between Tyler and Dana was likable but I felt there could have been more ""fire"". Once I really got into the novel, it was over. The storyline had great potential but in the end it was just o.k."
5,Excellent water bowl for mid west.,This water bowl is large capacity and holds enough water for a full day for our Saint Bernard. It has kept the water thawed in temperatures of -5 so far this winter. I would recommend this product if you have an outside pet in a location that temperatures drop below freezing.
3,Its ok,About a year after buying this the book fell aprt. We plan on if we can find it cheap replacing it
3,Overall a good guide,I found the book to be extremely helpful with digivolving and the DNA reference page was a godsend. The only problems I found with the book were the typos and occasional mistakes concerning what digimon you'd find in the domains. You should definately get this book; just watch out for the mistakes therein. Be on the look-out for Flym and cross-type digivolution (which isn't clearly stated in the book ie. Zudomon to Preciomon)
1,Negative-1 Trillion Stars,"... Before I liked Pokemon I thought Digimon would be better but after seeing 2 Digimon episodes I decided it was weird and gross(The first one I saw showed blood). Then when i gave Pokemon a chance I decided I liked it better because the plot had more to it,it didn't show blood(except when meowth scratchs Jessie and James but nothing major),and the characters were better(including the animals) although that weren't as many people as in Digimon. Also,Digimon is sorta like a copy of Pokemon since they are basicly the same except that Pokemon is better. Like they say:""There's nothing like the original""."
1,Kitchen crap,"We completely remodeled our kitchen in red and thought these plates would be an awesome addition. Now, they are very pretty and are not too heavy. The problem is they're completely crap quality. Two trips through the dishwasher (on top rack only) and one of them lost half of the red coating and two more began to peel. I'd say if you don't mind hand washing dishes, these would be ok but we're busy people and if it doesn't go in the dishwasher it goes in the trash. I'd buy something a little sturdier."
5,"Melamine -- Yes, it's plastic...",I read other reviews -- and the only negative seemed to be that the individuals didn't know what Melamine was when they ordered it. These plates are great! We use them for snacktime at playgroup. They have a nice color and shine that isn't obviously plastic from a distance. Good quality melamine.
1,didn't last,"Within 12 months, were badly worn and cracked. Just threw out the last three of them. These plates are of very poor quality."
2,RED SALAD PLATE,"cheap, but you get what you pay for. get hot in microwave. and one dropped on the floor and shattered in to several pieces like thin glass."
4,Nice for Snacks,"I chose these because the color went with the stoneware set I already have. I figured these are nice to use for sandwiches or snacks and when we eat outdoors. They do fine in the dishwasher. I did have an issue with some discoloration, but that was more my fault than the plates. I put a heated blueberry pie on the plate and the plate now has some staining. Otherwise, I've been very happy with the set."
5,Hope You Have Good Luck Karen,"This story takes place in the present at school and at Karen's house.At school Karen is having a lot of problems and cause of that her mom (Mrs.Sossi) took away what she always wanted to do. That setting is important because it shows that Karen wants to learn and wants to get educated and it talks about what she does things that are not important.This book is mostly about Karen and her family Mrs.Sossi (mom), Mr. Sossi (dad), Elaine (sister), and Aldo (brother). Karen is having problems with one of the teacher for not doing . Then Karen has been assigned to do something for a teacher.In my opinion I liked the book because it is interesting , sometimes some parts seemed realistic kids. I would recommend this book because it is interesting not boring to read and catchy by the title."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"This is a great book which describes the situation of the gauchos in ARGENTINA (of course, long ago).I recomend the readers to check the wise tips given by ""el viejo vizcacha"", in one of the chapters. (They are great (and real))."
2,Not the correct edition,This was ordered as the tenth edition for a summer class. When it arrived the book was a 8th edition which was vastly different and affected my ability to perform as well in the class.
1,Doesn't Work,"This device was apparently defective. The red light would come on, but neither of my dogs showed the slightest response to it.I returned it."
2,They ignore it,This worked great the first 2 days. Now both of my dogs ignore it. I would say it's a waste of money for 2 days. :(
3,Not For My Dog!,"We have a lhasa apso mix and it only works on him when he isn't over the top with his barking! I am assuming that whatever reange this sonic tone that comes out just can't overcome all the adrenalin pumping thru his body when he is overly excited just, particularly when we are in the car. When it comes to him just hearing something in the entry way of our apartment and he barks a few times, then it works. Basically if you want this item to work, you better own an average hyperactive dog, not an above average. Ours is way above average, I guess a bark collar is the only fix for this."
4,Works....but,"I purchased this product to assist with training my Puggle to cease excessive barking. I paired the trainer with a palm out hand signal. The product did definitely work, but the reaction my dog had to it was severe. I used a very brief push of the button. She immediately quit barking, but ran to her bed downstairs. When we checked on her about fifteen minutes later, she was shaking violently and stress shedding hair everywhere. She seems to be extremely sensitive to the device, therefore, I will discontinue using it and work with verbal commands and hand signals instead--not worth the stress for her. I did give this four stars because it does work, and I have since given it to my mother. She has had great success with it and no extreme reactions from her dogs."
2,Pretty much worthless,"After reading several reviews I took a chance & should have saved my money. Unless you are standing face-to-face with a dog, it is ineffective, and if they're that close, it's too late!"
2,Doesn't work on Jack Russell,We must have the loudest JRT on the planet w/ a high pitched shrill wall-shaking shriek-y bark. Unfortunately this did not work. Guess even *he* can't hear it over his own noise.
4,works good on cats!!,"I bought this item to use to help break my dog's barking at night. When i got it, i pressed the button and the cat took off like lightening! So, obviously, there is a noise they can hear.. I tried using it on the dog; but he's getting smart.. He doesn't bark when i'm standing outside.. he waits til i go back inside to bark. I know he hears it; but it doesn't seem to stop his barking if he's focused on another dog or cat. But I will say they can hear it and the cat hates it.. so if you have issues with your cat, it works!"
1,not effective,"Did not work at all for my sheltie, even with commands. I do not recommend buying this product. I haven't tried other products because I found some training methods from a book I borrowed from a neighbor to be much more effective."
1,Not effective for my dogs,I had high hopes for this product after reading previous reviews. I have a small poodle that barks at the drop of a pin. This device did not discourage her one bit. My other dog seems oblivious to it as well. The cat however did seem very disturbed by it.
4,Pretty Spiffy!,"I expected to get this - try it - see it didn't work and send it back. But it DOES work! All you have to understand is that it ""gets their attention!"" They will stop 'whatever' they're doing, be it barking or whatever, then it's up to you to give them a command - with the ultimate goal being for them to learn the command without the device. But we have 4 dogs that go bark crazy when they see other dogs on a walk in the park - and you buzz this thing - and they all stop and look at you. 3 of the dogs stop barking altogether, but one of them - a Jack Russel - goes back to barking again. So there are dogs this might not work well with, but 3 out of 4 with us is a great relief!"
4,Pet agree agrees,"It works, though technique takes practice. Unfortunately, I can't use it when both dogs are present."
1,Made in the USA (badly),"I was pleased to see that this item was actually made in the States, it's been so long! It worked fine the first couple times I used it. After that, nothing. My dog completely ignores this thing. I checked the voltage and the battery is at full power. We need a truth in advertising law in this country. Into the trash."
2,Dog training Aid-K-Ii Enterprises Pet- agree,Product only seemed to make barking dogs bark more. Would not stop them from barking. I would not buy this product again.
1,Didn't work :(,"It got my dog's attention the first two times I used it, but not even enough to get her to stop the bad behavior. She would stop and tilt her head with her ears perked, but then would go back to doing whatever she was doing. Then after the third time, she didn't even acknowledge the sound. Returned it the next day."
2,Not effective with our Wheaten Terrier,Our wheaten terrier enjoys a good bark now and then. I thought this might do the trick. Unfortunately she seems to enjoy barking even more when the unit is used. I guess it is time to take my losses and get a trainer to deal with the barking behavior.
1,Not worth it,"The product was delivered very fast and had no problems in shipping. My problem is that the dog stopped responding to it after one day. It worked at first, the dog has problems with nibbling, but after the first day of use, the dog does not respond to the product one bit."
3,Ultrasonic Pet Training Aid,"The product works reasonably well, as advertised. We have 2 dogs (a miniture pinscher mix and a dachshund) and it works for the mini-pin but not the dachshund."
1,Didn't work on my dog,"I have a small Rat Terrier that is completely out of control on walks. When she sees another dog, she pulls, jumps, barks and goes wild! My wife and I hoped that this would be the answer, but she did not show any signs of hearing anything. She completely ignores it. I also thought I could use it, along with voice commands, to stop her barking in our back yard, but that also did not work. From other reviews, it sounds as if it has worked for other people, it just did not for us."
3,"Works for some, not all dogs","This works well on my border collie, but doesnt seem to have any affet at all on my labrador. Must be the shape of their ears.Update: my dog stopped responding to this and just ignores it"
1,not working,I bought this and some other dog repeller for my dad so he walk in the park safely without getting hassled by a nasty dog. He said he was almost bitten by a pit-bull when he tried to use this junk on it.
4,works!,"The Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer worked very well on my little Cairn Terrier who has acute hearing! Two beeps and her barking has curtailed by 75%! It has not worked nearly as well with my Cavalier...must be those big, floppy ears! He just doesn't seem to hear it. I would definitely recommend it for any breeds that do not have the big floppy ears though."
4,"Works great, wish it had a longer range","I bought a few different brands of bark off type gizmos, this device works better and faster at getting my dogs to stop compared to the auto ones I put on my fences, but it doesn't work further than 20 feet, I got these things because I'm tired of yelling, they almost always bark for a good reason, they're doing their job, but it is usually when my neighbors peek over the fence which becomes a bigger problem if any other neighbors get pissed at the barking. I bought one that looks like a bird house that so far has the longest range, but it seems to work in one general direction, so if they're barking beyond the device it doesn't work so good, and the bark offs that are on the fences are not as loud, I can tell because they stop barking when they don't get too rowdy, but they don't stop when they're barking their heads off."
1,Disappointed,The battery with a use by date of 2015 was DOA. I replaced the battery and the red light would come on when pressed but had no effect on either of our dogs or other dogs. I returned it to Amazon for a refund.
1,Disappointed,"Bought the Pet Agree for protection when walking my dogs. After trying it on mine I decided to return it. They heard something as one of their ears twitched. The other had no reaction. And yes, they both can hear. I am returning for a refund.I love shopping with Amazon. Their return policy is wonderful."
1,K ll ultrasonic dog trainer,This product had zero effect on our dog either in training or when resting. Might not be the units fault but rather that our pooch has a higher tolerance to the sound emitted.
5,pet agree,great product it works real good on my dogs as well as my neighbors dog.my little cha. will start groweling at something that i dont see inside the house and my lab will start groweling at him so it helps to stop that. the only bad thing is it gets my other two that are not doing anything would recommend.and use training as well.
2,Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer,We bought this unit to train our Chihuahua to stop barking. She definitely hears it and does respond to it but it does not stop her from barking when you use the unit. I feel it was a complete waste of money.
1,The worst product. Doesn't work at all.,The worst. Doesn't work at all. I am very sad I spent money for that. Doesn't affect the dogs at all. I was thinking that would keep dogs far from me and my people but I was wrong. Doesn't work at all.
1,Wasted money,"In short, my 17 old cat just completely ignores it, and 7-year old cat just barely notices there is some sound but it does not prevent him to do what he intended to do. Wasted money!"
2,Fun item,Makes our cats ears perk up when I momentarily hit the button.But for the two neighbor dogs- it has no effect at all.
5,Awesome way to control barking!,This is an awesome product. My three dogs are responding well to the training with the Pet Agree!
2,didnt phase my little girls!,"I bought this product in hopes it would quieten down my 2 year old Yorkie & my 1 year old Pohmeranian... Not only did it not even phase them, it actually made them bark more!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone with small, yappy or headstrong animals! I suppose I will go back to the ""newspaper method""!!! :)"
2,Is this thing on?,Can't really tell if it is working or not. There seems to be no change in my dogs barking.
1,Don't buy this,It doesn't work... A complete waste of money. I have a very vocal 6 year old German Shepherd who barks at everything and this had no effect on her whatsoever! Very disappointing!
4,It has improved our out-of-control barker!,"I'll admit I was skeptical that this would work, but was desperate for a solution to the incessant, out-of-control barking from our Labradoodle. Per the recommendation of an earlier reviewer, I made sure to use voice commands when pressing the button on this. (I use ""hush"" in a stern voice). When I use it, the dog instantly stops and looks at me and settles for anywhere from 20 seconds to a few minutes. If the distraction is gone (usually someone walking by), the barking ends. While it hadn't curbed barking completely, there has been a noticeable difference. I like that the device has a belt clip -- when we first got it, I would wear it while working outside so it was always within reach."
2,Not effective after first few uses,"The Pet-Agree Ultrasonic only got my dog's attention the first few times I used it, then he completely ignored the sound. Did not work as advertised!"
1,Mickey Mouse,Does not work even close up. Does not even work in the house. I wish it did. I really needed it. My dogs just ignore it as those it is not even there.
1,This doesn't work at all,I ordered this hoping it worked as other reviews mentioned. I was dissapointed. I point this at my dogs and they don't hear anything. They continue barking as if nothing was heard. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; it's a waste of money!
4,"great for some animals, no results with other animals","Purchased this due to excessive barking from both of my neighbors' dogs. I half expected the device to be a waste of money but it worked extremely well with one of the dogs(small terrier mix)-he instantly stopped barking and moved to the far corner of the yard. I tried it with the other neighbor's dog (chocolate lab mix), he stopped mid bark and tilted his head but I had no discernible results on subsequent uses. It does seem more effective on felines."
2,Only works on my cats,"I bought this after reading all the great reviews so I was really disappointed to find that it didn't work at all with my lab/beagle puppy. She just cocks her head when I hit the button. The sound doesn't bother her in the least. However, the cats freak out and run away. So if you're looking for a training device for stubborn kitties that keep jumping on the counter or scratching something they shouldn't like the puppy this is the device for you. I'm going to try the Dazer II instead."
2,Nice but don't bother....,We received this in hopes to help deter our dogs barking when we let him out to go to the bathroom. We tried this device and it got their attention the first couple of times. after that they pay no attention to it.
2,"sometimes works, sometimes it doesn't...","I purchased this item because I go horse riding in trails where we get attacked by dogs sometimes. Well, the devise seems to work sometimes, and the dogs will just stop harrasing, but sometimes it is as if they don't hear it.I wish there was something more efficient to stop at once the vicious dogs...."
1,Plan B,"My nextdoor neighbors have a young, large German shepard that they leave out all day and night. It barks all day long...but the police won't do anything about it because its not a ""sustained"" bark over a certain amount of time. The neighbors are elderly acloholics and will bring the dog in when i complain, but the next day its business as usual. Telling the dog to lie down and go to sleep didnt work...reporting the dog to the city police officers didnt work...talking nicely to the neighbors didnt work...so i tried out the Pet-Agree. Guess what? Nothing. The dog is 30 feet away and it had no affect. So, i went with Plan B. I pulled out an old wrist-rocket i have and plunked the dog on the rear end. He ran under the deck and didnt come out for the rest of the day. Works every time. Thanks Pavlov for the conditioned-response research. Problem solved."
1,Item review,I purchased the item understanding it would be an aid to training my chihuahua not to bark when visitors come into my living room. He totally ignored the device. Returned for a refund.
2,Works on big dog only with 10 ft away.,"Two small and one large barking dogs next door, Works well on big one, but not the other two. 10 ft away or shorter."
2,Not strong enough,"Have two miserable neighbor dogs about 10 ft from my bedroom window. Ahole neighbor leaves them outside all hours and they bark constantly. Reported to police and animal control, but nothing has changed. Will have to report again and again and hope the dogs get taken away. Bought this device in the hopes it would shut them up. It DOES get their attention. They look at me funny, but continue barking their butts off. If a dog wants to bark, it will bark. This does not make them quiet, it simply distracts them for a minute. Will return this, don't waste your money if you have really crazy loud dogs, this doesn't phase them."
4,Dog breed important concern,"We have an Australian Shepherd that we adopted at 5 months of age and he has been a real challenge to train. Tried several trainging aids, had very little success. Decided to give this a try as he does respond to sharp sudden noises. True to form this worked for one day and as he has done for other things that initally startled him he attacks the ultrasound. However purchasing this training aid was not a total mistake, we also have a couple of cats who are responding to the ultrasonic training aid. The key to making your decision on wether or not to try this is dependent on the type and personallit of your dog. Since it works for the cats there is no doubt that this training aid does emit a high pitch sound."
1,Doesn't work on my dogs,"My dogs bark all day long at people walking by the house so I ordered the ultrasonic dog trainer as a way to eliminate the barking. It seemed to work the first two or three times I used it on them, but they stopped responding after that. The device has no effect on them."
2,crap,"Sure it stops dogs from what they are doing, but only momentarily. If you have a large breed the shock collar is still the way to go."
2,"Well made, but not affective for us.","Have had this unit for some time, and it is not affective in stopping the barking of our Jack Russel terrier. He hears it, and it startles him, but then, he keeps on barking. We've tried it at home and in the car to no avail."
5,pet-agree ultrasonic,Purchased this item because we have a little dogwho barks way too much at everything. It workedthe first day. Only have to say no or blue and shestops barking. I also use it to call my large dogin at night.(We have acreage). Works great and they get a cookie fortheir good behavior. Love this product. The price is awesome.
1,Garbage,"I don't know if I was sent a defective unit, or if my Labrador just chooses to ignore the sound. Sometimes he'll look at me when I push the button, as if he's wondering what I'm up to. As for having any effect on his behavior, absolutely not. I could do better with a squirt bottle. I would send it back but I'm not going to bother with the shipping costs (and the ones I've already lost in the original shipment). I tried to save ten bucks with this item and I got what I paid for."
2,Didn't Work,"I bought this product for my Terrier, but he only stops for a moment then ignores it totally. It only works for a short time after my pet understood the noise he no longer responds to the sound."
4,it really works,"I have recently purchased the bark control andi am satisfied with the result. If it is usedas instructed with a command to the dog to stopbarking, and then press the button, he willstop although after a while he will try again.Migdalia S, Curacao N.A."
4,Works Well - but a pain,"I have tried so many different products to help my dog stop whining, yelping and barking. A shock collar helped with the barking but nothing seemed to help with the whining. This ultrasonic training device works well. Every time the dog yelps, you push the button and it immediately distracts the dog. The only issue I had is that it is a pain to have to carry it around and manuall push the button."
5,Great training tool,"I have two min pins that have been used to barking at everything and everyone all day long. I bought this to try before I invested in bark collars.... Once they would start going nuts- I couldn't get them to pay attention to any command. This product worked like a charm. It gets their attention for me to give them a command. Within a day of using the pet agree consistently, they have modified their barking. In addition, it was works on our nieghbors dog who freaks out and constantly barks and howls when his owners leave him outside for the night! What a huge relief! Both of my dogs also become aggresive toward other dogs on a leash so I think the pet agree will also help train them not to do that as well... Great buy!!!"
2,"Worked at first, but then gets less and less effective","The first couple of times I used this on our Yorkie, it worked. He had a sock in his mouth and immediately dropped it. I rewarded him as directed. The next few times I tried using it, there was little or no effect on his behavior. It does seem to work to call him back in the house when he has been let out into our back yard."
1,Worthless,This unit tho highly rated performed no function. The dogs had no reaction to it except curiosity. They came up and sniffed the unit while it was activated. I highly recommend this unit as a paperweight.
2,Blah,"Ended up returning this product. None of my dogs even responded to it in the slightest. If they could laugh at it, I think they would have. I could have sworn I saw little smirks on their faces!"
1,Worthless,We have a Boston Terrier that jumps on people. Thinking this would be better than a shock collar was asking to much. May be good for dogs that aren't mentally handicapped.
2,Try Something Else For A Golden Retriever,"After reading other reviews, we purchased this item to help us train our golden retriever not to bark when there wasn't a valid reason (someone at the door, stranger in the area...). It was effective for about a week and then only seemed to egg our golden retriever on when we used it. We have stopped using the device. It was a waste of money."
1,Didn't work for my bark determined puppy,This was our 2nd ultrasonic trainer - see my other review for the other brand that didnt work. It confused her for about a day then she could care less. The only time it worked was when she was barking so much my mom threw it at her!Now we use a spray bottle and she quites down.
2,Didn't work for us.,We ended up buying a shock collar with the vibrating feature. This little clicker just did not work for us. At first it got the dogs attention but after she realized it didn't do anything it did not work
1,dog trainer item,"wasted my money do not think worked liked it was suppose to and could not be bother to return the item, would not recommend it to anyone...."
2,Music to my dog's ears,"In fairness I haven't tried it on other dogs, but mine pays no attention to it. I'll wait to see how it works on other animals but for now it is sitting on the shelf unused."
2,Worked for 1 day,"This works really well to irritate our cats, but we got it for our puppy and after one day, despite using it very sparingly, he stopped responding to it. Our cats still shoot us evil looks and run though."
3,Works on some Dogs not all,Bought this to discourage our neighbors dog(1.5 year old black lab) from using our yard as his bathroom. It has no effect even if you are 1 foot away. It does work on our dog a 60 lb goldendoodle.
1,Still kept barking,"K-Ii Enterprises Pet-Agree Dog Training Aid Ultrasonic does not work on my neighbor 's dog. It still keeps barking when I push the button. Only there are fewer time it goes away, but still keep barking from about twenty feet away. I thought maybe I need a stronger one to work on it. Anybody has better idea can help me?"
2,"Dog notices, but doesn't care","My malti-poo knows that I am using the device, but doesn't care. It isn't enough of a distraction or deterrent to stop bad behavior"
3,Did not work on my neighbor's dog,"I purchased this item because my neighbor's dog barks non-stop at anyone in my yard. I thought this device would help, but she doesn't seem to respond to it at all. My one cat heard it and got scared, but now also seems immune. At least it was only $25."
4,Dog silencer,"We spend half of our years in Romania where almost every house has a guard dog or dogs and many dogs run loose on the streets. We hear dogs barking almost always. I have used the Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer on neighbor's dogs on both sides of our house and on dogs I have encountered when walking. When using it on the neighbor's dogs as they bark they have eventually gotten the message that the ultrasonic sound discomfort comes when they bark and they have largely quit barking when I am around. I'll continue to use the trainer as necessary to complete their learning process. When walking, dogs behind fences will frequently lunge toward the fence and bark or growl when I walk by. The use of the trainer has stopped this immediately and caused one dog to yelp as it ran away. I have yet to use it on a dog running the streets, but am convinced that it will stop an attack based on how it has worked with other dogs."
2,PET TRAINER,I DID NOT HAVE SUCCESS WITH THIS ITEM MY DOG JUST LOOKED AT ME AND COULD HAVE CARED LESS. SORRY
4,Worked on most dogs,I bought this to try and train my dogs to stop barking constantly. Overall three out of the four learned very quick when I give the command they stop barking. One however was obedient for about 2 days and then the Pet Agree Ultrasonic Trainer stopped effecting the dog. So overall I had a 75% effective rating.
3,Pet-Agree,"Didn't really work for my yorkies. They stop barking momentarily ... but continue to yip. May work for others, just not mine."
5,Awesome tool for a crazy cat,"My cat is CRAZY. 50% of the time he's lazy, cuddly and loving. The other 50% he's a wide-eyed attack beast. I got him from a shelter, but I don't know whether to blame the previous owners/abandoners or his maleness. Probably it's just the maleness (plus he's only a 1.5 yrs).We tried blowing in his face (sorta works), water squirt bottle (works, but not instant enough to negatively reinforce behavior), and some house guests have straight up bit him back.I heard about this product in my dog training class. Apparently it doesn't work for most dogs, but almost always works on cats. We have been very careful to only use it for teeth-on-skin violations so cat gets a clear message that that is unacceptable behavior. He still goes for it some times, but much less frequently, he doesn't bite as hard, and he's quicker to leave off.Great, humane product."
4,Works on one dog,"This product works better than another brand that we tried. We had this brand years ago and it worked on all three of our dogs. Now, it works on one, but not on the other. Still, it was worth it. If this one lasts as long as our first one, we'll have it for many years."
2,Disapointed,It didn't work as I expected.I intended to use it to restrain my dogs from barking so much.It didn't.
1,Do not waste you time,Maybe this works for some dogs but our dog acted like nothing was going on when we used this on him.
2,Dog laughs at this thing,The Boxer didn't even hear this thing.The lab puppy paused for about a half a second and then ignored it on repeated attempts.
1,Didn't work with my Schnauzer,"At first it seemed to help, but she got used to it and it just made our other dog wonder why she was getting punished all the time.I can't say it doesn't work. I have spent a fortune on bark control devices. I've tried electric shock, ultrasonic, like this one, wistles, treats, and citronila collars, and none of them seemed to phase her after a coupon days.!!The one that works best is the ""Gentle Spray Sense Anti-Bark"".It might work for anyone else, my girl is high maintenence!!![...]"
1,Not worth the money,I have two older dogs that never seem to stop barking and this product was worthless maybe it would have worked if they were still puppies but I found it to have no affect on my dogs
3,questionable,I am not sure it works as dogs seem not to take notice and this after observing about eight different dogs when depressing the switch even though the indicator lamp comes on...I think I may have to purchase another one.
3,good not great,"i really wanted something that would work outdoors; indoors my dog is very responsive (and he's a Rottie, no less) but I wanted something to help train him away from squirrels and other dogs when walking him. He doesn't hear this product when we're outside."
4,Best safe trainer!,I purchased this to get my dog to stop jumping on our legs and the second I pick it up he sits! I love this item. I would recommend it to anyone!
5,no more barking,This product is AMAZING. Neighbors dog barked from time they left house til got home at night. Used this product for one day and I can now go into my backyard and enjoy my family without a big barking dog scaring everyone. I recommend it to everyone who has a problem next door that the owner is ok with.
2,"Worked on aggressive Pit Bull in my building, then stopped working.","A neighbor in my building has an aggressive Pit Bull that seems like he will rip you to shreds whenever anyone walks by their door. The dog goes into attack mode it's very scary.I bought this and the first time I tried it, it did not work as the dog was behind their Apt door barking and trying to scratch at the door as if to knock it down and attack passers by.I then pointed the unit near the bottom of the door where the dog was ripping and barking at and pressed for 5 seconds saying ""NO"".The dog SHUT UP. Unfortunately, it stopped working after a few weeks. The dog's owners have threatened anyone who dare to complain.Not suggesting all Pit Bulls are abusive, but this one is."
2,My dog can't hear it but my cats can,"I gave it two stars because at least it quiets my cats! Sometimes at night they yowl, this stops it...my pomeranian, however, can't even hear it and so far it hasn't really worked on any dog I've tried it on, from neighbor dogs to my mother's dog...only the cats seem to notice this thing."
5,Awesome,"My Dog has finally stopped barking!!! He just sees me reach for it, and immediately stops barking. A great training tool."
4,pet training,"It didn't seem to work on my dog (big dog who is 11 yrs old) because when I pressed it he didn't seem to be bothered by it or his ears didn't perk up however when my daughter's dog who is only 5 yrs old came over and I pressed it, his ears jetted straight up! So I'm figuring it's his ""older"" ears that cannot hear it as well or it's not as sharp on his ear as a younger dog."
1,Blue Brick,"Save your money for this one. We tried this on several dogs, along with the proper commands. It was like holding a blue brick in our hand. Absolutely no effect. Nada. Zip. Barking kept going on. No reaction. What a waste."
4,Works OK,We used this to stop our dog from scratching up our door (to go out). She took immediate notice. I wish it would go through glass so that we could use it to not scratch on the outside when she wants to come back in.
4,Don't have to give the dog away now,It works to interrupt the barking. It won't stop it altogether but with this device and some dedicated training the barking has been reduced to a manageable level. You must only use it when they bark though. I would recommend it for annoying barkers.
1,Does not work!,"This Pet Agree Clicker thing doesn't work for once!!! It doesn't even get the puppy's attention, no mattter when he barks or bites! Should not have wasted the money if I had seen such a warning! The water spraying method would work instead!"
2,Not good for outdoor training.,"I got this sonic trainer to train my 2 puppies to stop eating bad stuff outside. I don't want them eating sticks and pebbles/rocks. It worked at first but they learned that they just have to run out of range. Then it lost all effectiveness outside because they started ignoring it all together. I do live in a noisy area and that probably doesn't help. But I think it is useless outdoors and it works fine inside. I find they react better to my voice than this thing, so for that reason I hardly ever use it."
2,No longer working....,I purchased this product after a woman told me that it works really well. I checked the online reviews and that was the general consensus. I tried it and it worked really well for about a week. Then it suddenly stopped working on my miniature schnauzer. It also has zero effect on my cocker spaniel. I think the schnauzer still hears the sound but it must not be strong enough for her to stop barking.
1,The book will brainwash you with socialism: steal from the rich & give it to the poor,"It's a propaganda text disguised as an economics book.Don't buy it, the book is meant to have you espouse socialism & communism while pretending to actually teach you economics.In it, ""distribution of wealth"" is recognized as a valid ""economic"" maneuver, not as a form of institutionalized theft... Do I need to say more?"
3,Watch out for custom editions!,"This is a warning for students - the paperback and hardcover books are different in this instance - the paperback does not have all the chapters that the hardcover edition has. So if you need the 9th edition in hardcover, do not buy the paperback!"
4,Great book!,"I bought this book after reading ""New Deal or Raw Deal"" and wanted to learn more about Roosevelt's presidency. This book was very thorough in presenting the policies of the president amidst the bad economy."
4,Good text,This was used as a textbook in one of my college history courses and was pretty easy to follow. I enjoyed learning about this time period.
5,this will definitely turn your blood cold,malevolent creation doesn't sugar coat their music. they put more bite in their music than mike tyson does on his opponent's ears.
4,one bad a** band,"while not as musically sound as its predecessors joe black, and eternal, it is as heavy as the heaviest thing.dave cullross is replaced on drums by dirk roddy. roddy plays so fast, im suprised the rest of the band can keep up. but thats just a testament to how good malevolent really is. unbelieveably fast and brutal, malevolent decides to let it all hang out and just be as heavy as possible. in cold blood offers some of the fastest, most unbelieveable death metal ever. they are the true kings of brutal music."
2,One Good Number,"I heard ""Heart of Mine"" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury. After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked. Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me. You could argue that he is going for a ""relaxed"" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well. Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great. The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper. For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful. Having said all this, ""Heart of Mine"" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD. Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site."
5,nuf said,I have a broad range of favorites from country and rock as well as jazz and pop! It takes something extrodinary to get me to buy it. Of the 200 or so cd and dvd music disc I have this one gets the most play.NUF SAID!As I grew up in the 60s Nora's Joplin like sound in this blues style format has become my favorite. No one will be disappointed when they get it home.Mitch
5,well done,now THIS is the norah I like. This style suits her much better than her attempts at trying to be a grown up singer for the coffee house yuppies
4,Best Norah CD I've purchased..,"This CD was bought on a whim. I didn't really expect much from it at first. After I bought it however, I wondered why there wasn't any media hype surrounding it. This is one of her best albums, but it's not her normal stuff. It's definitely worth the money for any fan."
5,Amazing work!,Her voice is smooth and singing is flawless on this album. I especially like songs 4 - All Your Love and 5 - Heart of Mine. They have kind of a bluesy type sound to them as well. This is the first time I've heard The Peter Malick Group play and they definitely found a complimentary singer in Norah Jones. I'd like to see the group and Norah Jones do another album. I enjoyed listening to Norah Jones on this album more than on her own!
1,New York City has suffered enough,"It's been a rough past couple of years for NYC, & now one of the worst cd releases I've heard in a while has yet again marred the name of our great metropolis.Norah Jones is a great Vocalist, but this is demo sounding song material & recording quality. The only thing about this recording that's redeemable, is Norah's voice. If you want to hear that, I'd wait for her next release, or catch her on her DVD, or live or something. Otherwise if you like giving your money away for almost nothing in return, try a good charity. This record was way over hyped.. Poor production, & sounds thrown together. Thank God Norah has her own band & project now!"
2,A Sharp Drop,"Compared to ""Come Away With Me"", it is a bust. Ms. Jones voice seems strained, and the group is nothing special. Nor are the arrangements. It lacks the style and taste of the first CD, having nothing like the delightful blend of styles."
3,"Ok but not Great Like ""Come Away With Me""","One thing I notice about Amazon is that it seems they always put the positive reviews first. I'm wondering if this is on purpose?I was very disappointed with this album based on the glowing Amazon reviews. I think it is a good album but not nearly as good as ""Come Away With Me"" album."
1,Unauthorized,"In speaking with Norah herself last summer, I learned that this CD was not authorized by her. It is simply a collection of recordings this guy made before she became a star. She does not endorse this album and discourages her fans from buying it."
1,An example of blatant profiteering,"What can one say about someone who records with an unknown singer/pianist in 2000, does absolutely nothing with the material until that singer/pianist becomes a multi-grammy award winning performer, and then markets the recordings without her permission?The one star rating is for Mr Malick, not Norah. She, as always, gets 5 stars from me."
3,"NOT a sellout, but not fantastic","This album is not a sellout for Norah Jones, as some have claimed, but it's definitely not as pleasing as ""Come Away with Me"" for the kind of people who heard that album (like me) and just swooned at her amazing voice. This is a blues album and it's not as creative as her listeners would expect. The musicianship is fine, but meant to not outdo her. That's fine, we're listening because it's Norah, not Peter Malick."
1,Who's Peter Malick?,"Why did this get released? I agree with those who say it sounds more like a demo tape than a full feature release. Norah sound good, but most of the songs are pretty bland.. I think I'll wait for her new album in the spring thanks..."
1,So short - not worth it,"There are so few tracks on this album, I would have been better off buying my favorites on iTunes. By the time you settle in to listening, it's over!"
1,"Not real bad, but not real good either.","This cd, is just ok.. Lacks the writing genius that was behind Narah's debut record. I agree with the other reviewers who said she sounded great on it, however you can only do so much for weak songs, even with a great vocalist. It's also a bit sad when you have to send your friends to defend your business practices in releasing a cd, as on reviewer apparently did. Can't say I've seen that before. CD not recommended."
3,too short,"There are some good songs on this CD, but it is only 30 minutes long. Too bad they didn't have enough material to release a full-length CD."
3,Okayish!!!!,"Once purchasing this CD, I had to come to grips with the fact that these tracks were completed before ""Come Away With Me"". Another thing, I had to come to grips with was this was Malick's album, with Jones as the featured vocalist. That being said, after listening to the CD, I was disappointed.Norah's voice and blues doesn't really mix. The flirtation with jazz and country, suits her better, as her last two albums demonstrated. She was all over the place vocally here, but grant it, she was an unknown at the time. Personally, I think she sounds better doing what she does now.Musically the album is one point, sad to say that Norah's voice does nothing for the band, as a whole. I can say there were two songs that I like, ""Heart of Mine"" and the title track ""New York City"", great songs, but falls short of what she's done afterwards.If I had to do it over again, this would be a CD, where I would burn a couple of tracks off of, if my buddy had it. I'd midly reccomend purchasing this one."
4,norah gets better and better.,"Hi, i come from new zealand, and when i first heard norah jones singing i got goose bump's all through my body, and hey i am 57 year's old, well i just fell in love with her music, and i cant wait untill this new cd come's out. norah has got the most sensual voice i have ever heard, and to go along with that she is a very beautiful woman. i hope that she keep's making new music for a very long time. I know of a huge range of people that love her music too.thank's for the oportunity to have my say.cheer's from jenny."
4,A Good Fusion,"What happens when you put togheter a great and talented voice (Norah Jones) along with a very good band (Peter Malick)? New York City. This album features the soft voice of Norah Jones with the talented lyrics and music of Peter Malick band, the result: A Good Fusion! The album in general remindme a lot to the previous Norah albums, but every song is unique and make this album very plessent and ejoyable!"
4,New York City,This cd is amazing you really get to hear the raw and natural vocal talent of Norah Jones with a great band backing her up. The songs are a much faster tempo than her later releases while still possesing that unique quality that is Norah Jones. I highly recomend this cd as it is a regular in both my car cd player and on my iPOD.
5,Love it!,"I have Come Away With Me and Feels Like Home (both of which are lovely albums), and this one can proudly stand alongside them on my shelf. Admittedly I was a little wary considering that this was created in collaboration with another artist (I'd never heard of Peter Malick - my loss!), but after listening to this, I can say that I unequivocally enjoy listening to every song. Strangely enough, the song that most people seem to attribute to their hearing of this album in the first place (Heart of Mine), is not my personal favorite, but it's still great listening. Overall the album is a catchy yet intelligent set, and I recommend it wholeheartedly. Norah Jones has never sounded better!(I've just learned that Peter Malick has another album with additional tunes PLUS all included on this track - I think I would recommend that one instead because I know that I will be looking for more by Peter Malick in the future)"
5,Norah's Voice at a Low Price...What's More to Ask For?,"These songs were written by Peter Malick, an excellent lyricist, and he knew just who to go to when he needed someone to bring these songs to life. His lyrics are excellent and fresh here, and her voice likewise, only adding to the deliciousness of the recordings. If you have and have listened thoroughly to Norah's full-length album COME AWAY WITH ME (and if you don't have it you're an unfortunate case) than you should know that many songs on here are certainly nothing resembling leftovers from the album; on the contrary, they'd sound very out of place on it. Songs like DECEPTIVELY YOURS are more upbeat, where Norah's voice goes far beyond where it did on her debut album. The result? Excellent ear-candy that's hard to turn off, and further evidence that Norah's voice is an instrument in itself."
1,Missed out on delivery,"I purchased this item and today I receive notice that the item has shipped. Using the tracking number supplied, it was already delivered and left in a garage up in Bemidji, MN. I do not know where this is at, nor do I know anybody up there. I live in Miami, FL, and the delivery is to my office. Due to the fact that there is no contact to find out, this is my only opton. Can somebody tell me where my order is? If it is lost please replace it or else refund my money.Thank you S. B."
4,INTERESTING,"ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A HARD STUDY, IT WAS VERY INDEPTH AND INTERESTING. WOULD RECOMMAND READER THAT ARE WELL VERSED IN SCRIPTURE STUDY"
5,Te Sigo Amando,These is a beatiful novel and if you like drama is perfect the story is excellent and Sergio Goiy preformance is perfect....
1,DVD,"Salve,Mi è arrivato il dvd completamente integro e ora però quando lo messo in play non andava e diceva che c'era un problema. Mi spiegate che cosa dovrei fare ora?? ve lo rispedisco e c'è qualche codice da inserire??"
3,Love Love this Novela!,"Everything was perfect except that the credits don't include the theme song ""Te Sigo Amando"" by Juan Gabriel and I'm not sure that the background music is the original from the Novela. The theme song and music is part of the magic. I can't comment in detail cause i haven't finished watching it so don't know if there are any glitches on the dvd."
2,Not what I expected,"Pretty much 4 tubes of aluminum(unwrapped,banging around with no packing),and missing parts.E-mailed company for missing parts.Never heard back or received."
4,Le Click,"Bought this solely for Tonight is the night, loved it as i was growing up in the 90s. There is some other good songs too."
1,Your mind will wander,"This book consists of page after page of uninteresting blabber, a jumble of words that say nothing and mean nothing. The author changes topics in mid sentence, I had no idea what he was talking about most of the time nor did I care to try and make sense of it. I put the book down a quarter of the way through it so I couldn't tell you if the author ever gets around to telling a story."
3,excelente pelicula de colombia,muy buena pelicula de colombiaexcellent movie from colombia overall is good action and drama
4,A ggod knife,"I bought this for my friend. After I saw it, i want one for myself. It's very good and useful knife."
4,Pretty cool,"This is a very slick little knife. The only thing I could possibly complain about would be the flashlight being less bright than expected. Other than that, awesome."
2,Need Some Processed Food?,"Gourmet junk food! It was fine at the discounted price, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Kasilof Fish Company Salmon Cheese Basket,I was disappointed because I expected to get more than 2 ounces of smoked salmon. I threw away the salmon spread. Suggestion-eliminate the salmon spread and increase the salmon to 4 ounces.
1,just too salty,I normally like wheat thins but this particular flavor was just too much -- too salty.
2,Beware of freshness,"I ordered these on a Manager's special and got the pack of six for around $12. That is a great deal! The items were shipped by Amazon LLC and I received them on a Saturday delivery. As usual, Amazon is the BEST online seller ever! However, the ""use by"" date was June 2010 and each and every package was stale. The cracker itself is very tasty but VERY salty as mentioned by another reviewer. I will be reluctant to jump on Manager's Specials in the future as lack of freshness was what I actually got. Should have returned them but Amazon almost always exceeds my expectations."
5,Great social documentary,"Milton Rogovin was a great photography who photographed working people at work and in their home environment. He is photographer who deserves greater recognition. This book has some striking photos of male and female steel workers - in their dirt and grind on the job and then in ""their Sunday best"", in their family environment -their two lives. Sometimes it is hard to tellis the same person in the two photos. The interviews of the workers by Mchael Frisch are interesting and combine with the photos portray the lives and pride of these workers."
5,The best reference to date!,"It's about time that a talented group of aquarium hobbyist (who are also biologists I believe) got together to write a book that the layman can understand and appreciate. You will not find convuluted passages common in the scientific literature. Each species account is well written and contains the information that the hobbyist wants.Goldstein, Harper, and Edwards are well known hobbyist and if there are any real experts in the field, it's these guys.This is an all around great reference for the North American native fish hobbyist."
3,Not that far out...,"Cocktail Nation takes a playful, often off the wall look at cocktails and the ""Art of Mixology"". Filled with off the wall stories and anicdotes that acompany most recipes, Beverly West and Kim Doi seem to take great enjoyment from poking fun at the establishment. While not the largest collection of drinks, games or stories Cocktail Nation is a most enjoyable light hearted read and would make an ideal going away present for the college student in your life."
2,List of Movies,"I don't understand why Amazon even bothers to list this item if it isn't going to tell you what movies it includes.I was curious so I looked on another site selling the same product. According to that site, the movies (on 5 double-sided DVDs) include: ""SLIPSTREAM (PG-13), ABRAXAS (R), CREATURE (R), LASER MISSION (R), ALIEN SPECIES (Not Rated), EYES BEHIND THE STARS (Not Rated), COSMOS: WAR OF THE PLANETS (Not Rated), VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET (Not Rated), THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE (Not Rated), and WAR OF THE ROBOTS (Not Rated).""I'm not familiar with any of these films and I don't know their release dates. Also, according to the box cover, the movies collectively feature Brandon Lee, Ben Kingsley, F. Murray Abraham, Mark Hamill, Jesse Ventura and Ernest Borgnine, amonst others.I take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information."
5,Lupin III's Greatest Capers,"Wolf, The International Police's most wanted criminal, is at it again; but Senagota ( Interpol's BEST! ) won't stop until Lupin is put behind bars. With Jegan, Goiman, and Fujico; Lupin stumbles into capers with REAL villains protected by their position and power, and nothing is what it seems. So hop in and buckle up, because when Lupin is at the wheel your in for some of the best car chases ever animated. At sea, on land, or in the air he'll push his luck to the very edge, because these bad guys are playing for keeps.Japanimation the way you remember. Anime that has entertained Japan since the 70's. So trust Lupin and the Wolf will steal your heart."
5,Own it,"I bought this in 04' & Love it!! Its more than just a Marshall.. Its sound is so much better.. Knowing all Marshall's have they're own sound.. This sounds so much better than what you expect!! THO-- I will say that after having a CRATE, my Crate sounds even better!!So if your looking to buy this because you LOVE MARSHALL as much as any metal head.. Look at CRATE first if your into METAL.."
4,Perfect Seat - Great Delivery,"I purchased two Britax Roundabout Convertible Car seats for my twin grand-daughters (13 months old). The seats are well made, easy to use, and meet all of the safety recommendations for infant travel. The Latte color was a great value. The seats arrived within 24 hours - just in time for winter mountain travel. The adults in our family are pleased and the babies seem comfortable."
5,"Good price, fast delivery",We needed a second car seat ASAP and amazon had the best deals for Britax closeout colors.
5,Great Car Seat,"Car seat is comfortable and spacious for my 14mo old. She is still rear facing, and the seat works great. It was easy to install and is easy to remove and put back in. I am very satisfied with this product, I couldn't choose between the Marathon and the Roundabout.....I chose the roundabout and got my money's worth."
4,Great for small car,"I have a Subaru Impreza hatch back and had trouble finding a convertible car seat which would fit in the back seat without having to make the front passenger sit very far forward. I like the Britax brand and we had the Wizard in our bigger car (it is a discontinued model which we got from a friend). The Roundabout fits great in the back seat and seems comfortable enough for our 8 month old (22 pounds and quite tall). I like the way the Britax strap adjuster works compared to some of the others out there that are harder to work or less sturdy. The little Velcro patches are a nice touch to keep the straps to the side but they still get tangled a bit.I would have given this seat five stars for the seat itself but when it arrived, the box and seat smelled horribly of cigarette smoke. I was able to air out the seat and it is fine but I was really disappointed it arrived in that condition. I don't know if it was the seller or the delivery folks who were at fault but it was nasty."
1,wrong again!!,"what i ordered was for a h2 hummer, what i rcvd was for a toyota fj cruiser, 2nd time i have gotten the WRONG ORDER! now they want to charge me money to ship it back to them. i guess this is the new american way."
2,So much potential but....,"This flick had so much potential in terms of content matter accommpanied with an incredibly talented roster, but somehow someone managed to screw that all up.The film has a ""I wrote this movie over the weekend"" feel to it; it's riddled with a bunch of serious and intense subject matter that never amounts to anything and fails to entertain.Though believable, you'll quickly grow bored with the sterotypical characters that have no learning curve or sensible growth."
2,ok movie,"i expected a bit more with this film,but it didn't quite get there. it had some moments. I got to see it recently&it was ok.there was some Foxxy looking chicks up in this movie."
4,Great movie,"Was not sure I would like the movie, but really enjoyed it and recommend others to get their copy for weekend movie nights at home!"
5,Make this #1 on your Top 10 List,"The entire cd will completely blow you away!The energy on each track is about as close to a live show as you can get without actually being there. The first couple of songs, ""Anyone But Me"", ""Here She Comes"" and ""Poor Paul"", get you moving. From there they show their creative side with an awesome, mind-bending rendition of the Huey Lewis tune, ""I Want a New Drug"". ""Hey, Girl!"" is my personal favorite, then they finish with an awe-inspiring ballad, ""I'm the One"".Although they are undoubtedly from another era, Mardo has a gritty, tough sound that keeps you wanting more!"
4,Mardo rocks,i liked this cd alot. it reminded me of diff classic rock bands all wraped up in one. all in all its well worth a buy!
4,One Of The Best,"One of the best albums/artist 'no one heard of'. The CD is filled with some really original and fun rock songs that are really just fun to listen to. The best songs are at the beginning of the CD, but the CD is still well worth your money and time. If you are reading this review and you don't have the CD, buy it."
4,"Great Album, But Other Bands Are Better","Out of the many Crowbar albums I own, this one has to stand out as the one I listen to the most. It's an older album now, and it still has a lot of originality to it. Plus, I feel that the song 'No More Can We Crawl' is perhaps one of the best Crowbar songs to date, and I made sure to give it plenty of air time on the radio when DJing at a radio station in Nashville, TN. This band has changed and matured over the years, yet has also managed not to lose that essence that made them so appealing way back when Phil Anselmo (of Pantera fame, for those of you living in a tree for the past few decades) produced their first album. All of Crowbar's music is intense, but this album stands out among all the rest."
2,Famished imaginations,"I like Beowulf. Its a world classic. And i LOVE sir Thomas Malorys ""Le Morte D`Arthur"".The problem is, they are completely different.Now, a Pendragon story where the king of the geats makes a cameo apperance, or, even better, a whole role - playing game devoted just to him, would be great. A supplement to a game that just isn`t suited to him is not. Especially when it is obvious that the designers are mostly just trying to see how they can get more of that popular sword & sorcery stuff forced into Pendragon, so it can earn them as much as all those other fantasy games.Medival scandinavia is full of great stories, even if you just stick to ""real"" history: but even though the designers have obviously researched the area carefully, they have not let this affect their lack of taste.I liked the ""forgotten"" celtic culture though - its the kind of daft things that Pendragon turns into something good. But it was not enough."
3,Bad Master,"Others have written about these CD-Rs coming from a bad master, just received this CD and it sounds like its skipping and missing bits of the music, others have said the same of the MP3s. Forbidden are, for me, one of the finest metal bands on earth and I could'nt really form an opinion of this album. I chose not to listen further and wait until I have an ""intact"" copy of it. What a shame, bought Mortal Sins Face Of Despair from ""pressed on demand"" and had no problems."
2,"Very Heavy, Distorted and Fast","This is definately the more distorted of all the Forbidden's albums. Unfortunately, the singer Russ Anderson is not keeping up with his previous ability to perform nice vocal lines. The Drums are fast, the guitar solos are ""ala Slayer"", and the resulting sound is sort of boring. I miss the old Forbidden from the albums ""Twist into Form"" and ""Forbidden Evil""."
4,Polotics and religion don't mix,"If you are a person who believes that Buddhists, particularly high lamas, are above politics, this book will disillusion you right away. Unless you watch the world scene very closely, you probably are not aware of the saga of the Karmapa, the young reincarnation of one of Tibetan Buddhism's most revered and beloved teachers. Unfortunately, the current version, # 17, has been a pawn in an international power play between the Tibetans, Chinese, Indians, and factions of his own lineage, since he was recognized as a child. It is a fascinating story.In this book, Ms. Terhune gives you most of the unsavory political details and a few of the inspiring points as well. However, as she is closely associated with one of the senior lamas engaged in the political drama, her impartiality is questionable.While I did enjoy this book, I suggest balancing it with ""The Dance of 17 Lives,"" by Mick Brown. It covers much of the same material and has a flavor that seems to me less biased."
5,Highly Recommended,"Lea Terhune writes a captivating investigation into the events surrounding, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa's life, escape from Tibet and the political intrigue that surrounds his recognition as the head of the Karma Kagyu lineage. Ms. Terhune obviously researched and interviewed highly credible and well placed sources for this book. This story has drama and intrigue, antagonists and protagonists. Once I started reading, I could hardly put this book down.This book opened my eyes to the extent which unscrupulous spiritual leaders will go in order to sieze ill gotten power and gains. I highly recommend this book to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike."
2,An inelegant propaganda book :),"With this book Lea Terhune, Tai Situ Rinpoche's secretary, simply takes several factious old assertions unsupported by facts and courts and proposes them again, but to a broader audience... it's just like trowing more mud on the mud and it's really nothing new in the Karmapa Controversy. In my opinion it's a very biased book simply stubbornly expressing -only one- of the controversy factions' views... very interesting is the fact that THIS BOOK HAS BEEN RESPONDED POINT BY POINT on the international - KARMAPA-ISSUE dot ORG - website. I suggest everyone to read both the book ALONG WITH the responses to it... it will surely be of great help in building up a fair personal point of view :)"
4,Good Workout,"For those of us who have weak backs, this is a great workout; especially for those who haven't worked out in a long time and or have weak backs. You don't have to do all of them at one time if it's too much of a strain, just do what you can and increase them as you get better."
3,Perfect for seniors,"I'm not a senior, but was looking for an exercise program for someone in a wheelchair. This DVD does not get your heart rate up. It's mostly stretching exercises."
5,We like it!,Stronger Seniors Core Fitness: Chair based Pilates program designed for seniors is a good workout. The seniors at my Senior Activity Center love it.
2,Stronger Seniors Core Fitness,"This fitness tape would be alright for someone who did not exercise regularly over the years.I found it slow, tedious and boring."
4,Very Good Sr. Workout,"This is very good workout for the senior population. My only problem with it is the obvious dubbing in of the narrator's voice saying ""pilates"" when it was very obviously something else originally."
3,This is for real beginners.,"I got this DVD because I don't exercise enough and thought it would be helpful to get me motivated; however, this DVD is more for people who don't exercise at all. If you exercise even a little, go to the next DVD in the line."
4,Good video,"The Stronger Seniors video was a good video. Fortunately, I've been working out with a trainer and it was too easy for me, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a good video. It would be helpful for anyone who can't actively work out and needs to sit in a chair to exercise."
5,Good Easy Program,"Doable by just about anyone. Even though the program is easy, I have found it to be effective. Will look for other DVD's in her series."
5,5 stars to Anne Pringle Burnell's Stronger Serniors DVDs!,"This expert teacher is clear & easy to follow. Along with Catherine MacRae's ""Gentle Fitness"" DVD and Sunshine's chair exercise DVDs, Ms Burnell's Stronger Seniors exercise DVDs are keepers, to be used over and over again. I like to alternate them with my stationary bike workouts."
3,Too big for aluminum Macbook,"We bought this for our new aluminum Macbook to protect it when it is in a larger bag. The outside pocket was an added bonus when we looked at the description. But when it arrived it was too large for the laptop, in that it was extremely loose inside of it and felt flimsy. I had purchased a case for my older iBook and it had something built into it that made the case slightly more rigid and protected.Case Logic gives a good warranty, but this did not meet our needs and we returned it."
4,remember it's tight,"I bought this case and am quite happy w/ it.But... I hadn't thought it would be so tight on my MacBook. Doesn't leave much room for carger, etc. Still, I'd buy it again. Great case, good price, looks cute (mine's red)."
4,Loves it!,"I love this sleeve! It perfectly fits my 13"" macbook and power cord. I feel a lot safer when i have my computer protected in there. The only thing i might change is to have a little handle or something just for added precaution that i don't drop it!I would def. buy this again if i had to."
3,pretty good,Item in perfect condition and packaging. Shipping price and time were a little over. It took my item almost 2 weeks to arrive.
4,Great for Dell XPS 12.1 with Extended Battery,"I bought this for a Dell XPS 12.1"" with the 9 cell battery. It fits perfect. Good little case. It has a strong odor of synthetic chemicals (rubber) when I first removed it from the packaging though. Other than that, I am pleased."
4,Blue Student Shuffle,This product has made my load a lot lighter. I stick it in my work bag and it keeps my computer safe.
3,"needed non-branded, but . . .","Though the description says ""-Branded Surface: No."", the hub itself does have ""Maxell"" stamped on it. It's barely visible in the photo, and could be mistaken for glare. I was specifically buying these for a limited-edition disc I'm making, and although I'm sure they'll record fine, having the manufacturer's brand on the disc isn't so ""pro"". A minor detail for most folks--but for those of you DIY musicians, you might want something else."
3,Good price / Bad packaging,"It arrived on good time, early.The only problem was the packaging, the spindles arrived broken. Even others has suggested that the packaging is poor, needed padding, no change has been make since my came in the same condition. No disc was broken.I have not try the disc yet but I will update my review if it doesn't."
4,Great Product Competitive Value,"I went along and bought these printable blank Cds, for the value. I'm happy with product, I trust them and have performed with no problem. We used them at our church to recording worship and sermons and they worked great. No complaints yet. The only issue was the packaging, the spindles arrived cracked and broken. Had to removed and used our empty spindles in order to stored them. Luckily none of the blank cds came broken. Amazon please work on packaging, items were very loose and had no adequate padding.Otherwise I'm happy with this purchase, but gotta tell you that I found cheaper deal at Sam's. For now I will purchase our blanks from Sam's club."
4,good printable CDs,These are very good CDRs for use with Epson Inkjet printers.The printing comes out very clean and clear.The CDs work well too.
2,Music interrupted by errors,"For some reason, burning audio CD's is still a fragile process. If any part of the operation is not up to par, you will get audible errors on your CD. I burned CD's using the ""slow"" setting in Windows Media Player to avoid errors. It seems that every CD I have burned from this bundle has about four errors per CD, on all of five or six CD's. The errors are interpreted by my car's CD player as a small bleep followed by silence for a fraction of a second, with the LCD screen reading ""CD Error"". It's too bad, because the blank white label side of the CD is great, in my opinion. Strictly speaking, maybe the problem could be my computer's CD burner, but I just really doubt that. I will have to try burning CD's even slower with third party software.Pros:-blank white label sideCons:-Every audio CD so far has had errors"
2,This book comes from a Christian perspective.,"I do not recommend this book if you are looking for an objective commentary on textual criticism. This book clearly is written with the inerrancy of the Bible in mind. It spends a paragraphs trying to convince the reader of how accurate textual variants are, and seems to spend no time exploring the differences in them. I felt like it was preaching to me as I read it."
2,"Too heavy for my fine, straight hair","I got a little sample tube of this with their shampoo/conditioner (which I love!). Gave it a try and had to wash it out. I only used a pea sized drop (I have a chin length bob) and it made my hair greasy. I think this product is just too heavy for my fine, straight hair. Think my niece, who has thick, curly hair, will enjoy it, though!"
3,Fekkai Glossing Cream,"I purchase this product to assist me in taming my unruly hair. I would say it does a decent job of making my hair appear shinier, softer and had a mild clean scent. Unfortunately, it wasn't spectacular and for the price I paid, I expected a little more. I probably will not repurchase this product."
4,Great for Poofy Hair,"I received a small sample of this Glossing Cream as part of a Buzz Campaign (I'm a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!) and have been using it the last few weeks. You only need a pea-sized amount to work through your hair to make your hair feel sleek and shiny. Whenever I blow dry my hair, it gets incredibly poofy. This glossing cream helps so much! And I love that a little bit goes a long way. When I buy the 4-ounce tube, it's only about $10 and it will last a long time. A great buy!"
3,Its ok but expensive,I have thick dry hair that gets frizzy and abused by hot rollers etc. I have used this product and it does help with dry frizzy hair however I would not rate it much better than other less expensive silicone glossing creams on the market. You only need a little or your hair will be greasy. I would rate this product 4 stars if it were not so expensive. Really we are just paying for a name.
2,Not for thick hair,"Didn't like this as much as I thought I would, it is very much a thickening cream and that is the last thing my already dense, pouffy hair needs."
1,Like motor oil with fragrance,"I bought this on the strength of other reviews without reading the ingredient list. This is virtually all silicone, which is both greasy and heavy like motor oil, so of course it smooths the hair and makes it shiny. It also makes it so greasy that you can feel the grease on your forehead and ears and cannot put sunglasses up on top of your head. I have curly hair and this is just awful for it. Also be aware that silicone, if used daily without anything actually moisturizing between, will dry your hair out terribly and leave it in worse shape. So then you won't be able to wear your hair without a product like this. By the way, there are much cheaper silicone-based glossing products sold at Walmart that do exactly the same thing for less than a tenth of the price."
3,Fekkai Glossing Cream,"I have fairly fine hair, and I was looking for something to give me more texture to stand up to the dry winds of the Southwest. This product did not do that. However, I gave it to a friend who has thick, curly hair, and she loves it."
5,Bvlgari for Women Eau de Parfum,This perfume is one of the sexiest I have ever used. I love the sensual fragrance and it gets a lot of compliments.
1,Product box is in a bad shape; bougth as new,"I received the product today. I was happy that it was fast but when I oppened the package, the Bvlgari box was in a bad shape, durty, looks like somebody else was using the product. I bought as new and I was very disappointed. Dispate the perfume be wonderful, the presentation was bad."
5,I am hero,"Great price for a great product. Shipped much faster than indicated. Was supposed to be a Christmas present but I love the scent and had to give an early gift...super price for a premium perfume.Comes in plastic shrink wrapped Bvlgari box, great bottle, super presentation."
2,Didn't feel right,"I am disappointed with this product. I first saw this perfume at Costco wholesale and decided to give it a try. I liked it so much. Only one puff lasted for 3 days. I bought the 1.7 size at $ 46.99 from Costco, so I thought this is really a good deal, double the amount for only $10 more. But this one was a complete disappointment, its aroma didn't last for two hours, and it didn't feel right. I will never buy perfume online anymore.As for the shipment details, I'm always satisfied with amazon. All products I order arrive on time and in good shape. This product arrived in the estimated arrival day, and was packaged in a very good way."
1,misrepresented!,Beware the actual product is cheaply made and 1/4 of the advertised size! Don't do it!!!
4,A Sweet Treat,The cranberries are halved. They are not whole peices. I gave them 4 stars because of the added sugar & oil which I think is unnecessary. They are a tasty snack and are great to use in baking & cooking but a tad too sweet. They would be perfect if they were 100% cranberries. I will continue to purchase them unless I find something better & comparably priced. A plus is the ALL organic ingredients.
4,"Perfect for some, but too sweet for me","My husband's love for raisins in his morning cereal has now been replaced by these cranberries, which he absolutely ADORES. To me, though, they're a bit too sweet to be really enjoyable. When I eat a cranberry, I want and expect it to be TART, and these little guys have no tartness I can detect. Still, I'm giving them 4 stars because they are very plump and moist, they're a good price especially for being organic, and I admittedly have less of a sweet tooth than the average person. Still, I plan to try some other organic brands of dried cranberries to see if I can find the tartness my tastebuds crave. My recommendation: give them a try and see what you think!"
4,For People New to Lisp Most Grok for the Buck,"Keeping with the Pragmatic Programmers goal of learning a new programming language a year I have decided to learn Lisp this year. Over the last few months I have purchased many books on the topic. While this book was not the first book on Lisp I purchased, if I had to pick one book for the purposes of just learning the language this would be it. However, once beyond just initial stages, especially if you are already a programer like myself, then this book becomes less important. Which is fine because I don't think the purpose of the book was written for more advanced developers."
3,Up and down,"For a beginner, the first 15 or so chapters of this book are a good introduction to Common Lisp. After that, however, it shifts gears and turns into an AI book that uses Lisp. Perhaps this is not surprising since it was written by two gents from MIT's famed AI Lab, but I was interested in learning Lisp, not AI. I really think that the last half should have focused on the parts of CL that were skipped in the begining."
4,It was pretty good!,I have almost all of the Saddle Club books including the pine hollow books! Out of all of the books I think this fits in the top 15.
4,Pretty good.,"I got really frustrated with this book because it did'nt say who had Stevie for secret santa! I liked it when they went caroling, but I wish Carol or Lisa would ride the Prancer rather than lead it. I think that would draw more attention. Over all. I would recomend all saddle Clubs to any one! There great!!!"
4,"Good, but . . .","Hey everyone! I really liked this book, but I had a question for the people who've read it. What happened to the Starlight Ride this year? Why don't the Saddle Club girls go on it? That part really confused me. Thanx."
2,"Story itself was great, but...","With all due respect, this book should have been a big hit. A father caught in the World Trade Center on 9/11/01, and his son ends us supervising (in prison) some of the terrorists who were involved in the attack. The only problem is with the descriptive language employed by the author. He comes across with messianic fervor, as if the fate of civilization rests upon the message he is trying to convey. It makes the whole book come across as self-absorbed, sanctimonious bilge. If Mr. Tulepan wishes to have a future in writing, a good editor who would tone him back some would be an absolute must."
5,treasure hunt,"My 8 yr old son, my husband and myself had fun with the book. It was like a treasure hunt! We looked for hidden Mickeys on the rides and while waiting in line. It gave my son something to do instead of complaining about the wait.The only drawback... The size of the book. It did not fit into my fanny pack. So I had to tear the sections. ie the Magic Kingdom chapters.I definitely recommend the book."
4,Family Fun,"If you have been to Disney a ton of times, This is the book for you. If it's your first time I think you'll enjoy it as well, BUT for you returners get ready to see the park in a hole new light. Whether you're with the kids or just a bunch of fun loving adults you got to try this. The book is set up like a scavenger hunt (for hidden Mickeys) and will give you excellent hints on where to look (with out giving away the exact location) and at the same time show you the best way to see each park. As a 34 year veteran I know my way around and this is just the way I do the parks (for the most part)shortest lines and most attractions covered. The book includes a scoring system witch is great for deciding who is picking up the bill for the next meal. But how ever you do it, it is lots of fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did."
3,Good if you're in WDW,"This is a great book to take to WDW, but if you're reading it at home, it's not of much value. The author gives hints of where to find the hidden Mickeys, like a treasure hunt. But like a treasure hunt, you have to be there to find (or appreciate) it. If you're in WDW, 5 Stars; if not, 3."
3,"OK, but not complete","This book is a lot of fun, but I question some of the hidden Mickeys in the book. Some aren't exactly hidden (the Mickey's in MouseGear at EPCOT, for example) but merely decorations. Other are very questionable and really aren't hidden Mickeys at all (by this I mean, just because there are three circles together doesn't mean they are a Mickey. A true Mickey has one large circle with two smaller circle ears). Other Mickeys are just over looked. For a free list of the Mickeys, you can also just checkout SpaceCoast Hidden Mickeys on the web. Overall, it's a fun book, but don't buy it if you are looking for a real list of the Mickeys."
2,Text book,"This book is very technical and difficult to stay with despite the fact the subject is amazing. It reads like a text book and would be good if you needed refrence material, but then the library is a better place to get it."
1,Watered Down,"I have used this product for many years but never purchased it from 3rd party vendors. I recently received this and had burning sensation on my neck area where I sprayed. It irritated my nose as well. I requested a refund and was told they tested it and found nothing wrong. Well, each person's body type is different and if a fragrance is old, the chemicals do change.Still waiting for my credit.I then decided to visit Hermes, and purchase their Hemes Hiris for Women.. NO REACTION BTW~I do like Amazon, but cannot say when you purchase something from another vendor you will receive the same courtesy."
4,A little wordy and tedious but keeps you hooked.,"This book starts out with intrigue and some twists right away and by 80 pages you're deep into the story- but not deep enough I feel, because of the lengthy descriptions of everything! I almost felt like he was trying to generate pages, to make sure there are four books in this series. It's kept me very interested though, I'm ready for the next one!"
3,"A welcome return, but where was the editor?","After two decades, it was a delicious treat to have a new Thomas Covenant book in my hands. But after reading this volume, I felt as if the book desperately needed an editor. It is very, very long and could have used some pruning. Mr. Donaldson's writing is wonderful, but it felt like there was no editor with an arched eyebrow and a colored pencil to rein in the excess."
1,"Extremely slow, and mostly reference material","The many problems with this book have been described by other reviewers so I won't repeat the details here.This book is ponderous and slow. I'm only halfway done with the book, it's my second attempt to read it, and I'm about to give up again. Nothing happens in this book. It's mostly one character telling another character about things that happened centuries and millenia ago. This is more like a reference book masking itself as a story. The events of the story account for maybe 5% of the total content, the rest is all backstory.I'll admit the book started well, but once Linden arrived in the Land, it ground to a halt. It took the author over a hundred pages to cover the time span of a day and a half. Reading this is work, it's not fun. Having just learned that there are 4 books to this series, think I'm going to bail out. It's just not worth the effort."
1,Quite boring really . . . .,"I've read the Chronicles I and II again recently; my third time. The first time I read them I was in high school, some 20 years ago. I admit I've only read about the first third of this book, but I really can't go on torturing myself. You know, even in the first two Chronicles it used to bug me how often you would see ""outcast, unclean."" In this book the phrase is ""Lord Foul has Jeremiah."" It's just lame. Way too slow and the more interesting portions of each action sequence leave me yawning. I thought Linden Avery was kind of turd in the Second Chronicles anyway. Now, as the main character, Donaldson's just polishing that turd, but she's still a turd. I think the leprosy angle was interesting for the first two Chronicles, but Avery's weaknesses just bore me. Sorry fans .."
2,Tarnished Gold,"Although I'm an avid fan of the earlier novels, I can't recommend this book. I felt like I was reading a synopsis rather than a story. Sadly, there are no new characters (with the exception of a blind madman who quickly becomes as annoying as Donaldson's use of the word 'apotheosis'), and the Land and its populace haven't changed even after thousands of years. (I know this is a fantasy book, but come on. You would think they would have at least invented gunpowder by now. No wonder Foul is always laughing) Not me - I'm crying, & praying the next book lives up to the hype - as well as expectations."
3,Wordy,"'The Runes of the Earth' is the first book in the 'The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant', this coming some 20 years after the publication of 'The Second Chronicles'. It's good to be back in the Land but 'Runes of the Earth' is definitely a weak link in the series. Donaldson is even more verbose than in prior books and the plot moves forward very slowly as the events of the prior books rehashed over and over. The result is that not much new seems to happen in this one. Also not much seems to have changed in the Land in the many centuries since Linden was last there, the same peoples, cultures even the same villages. It might as well have been five years since Linden was last in the Land, for all the difference it makes.It all seems very stale, hopefully the next book in the series will add something new."
3,Not up to previous standards,"As a huge fan of both previous Covenant trilogies, I have to say that this didn't meet the standard set with those six books. I really wanted it to be great and expected it to be great, but I was disappointed with the rehashing of everything that had gone on before. If I wanted that, I'd read Terry Goodkind. It does seem to set up an intriguing story to come, but it took too much time to develop. Maybe I'm being overly critical, but the first series is what turned me on to fantasy, and I still enjoy reading it and being transported to The Land. Of course I'll read the rest of the books when they are released, but if this was the first book I'd read from Donaldson, it would have been the last."
4,COMPELLINGLY LISTENABLE,"With unfailing narrative skills ace voice performer Scott Brick imbues this eagerly awaited story with added power. Mr. Brick is the winner of numerous awards, and one realizes why when hearing his direct, measured delivery which renders even the most fantastic stories highly believable and compellingly listenable.Although Donaldson's protagonist, Thomas Covenant, was first met two decades ago he's lost none of his power to intrigue. Nor has Donaldson lost any of his ability to write a fascinating tale.As fans know, Covenant is dead and has been for some time. Now, we find his lover and companion, Linden Avery, locked in a struggle to reclaim her kidnaped son. To do this she must return to the Land, where she finds Lord Foul up to an even more frightening sinister scheme.Listen and return to the conclusion of a story that spellbound thousands.- Gail Cooke"
3,Whiny & Repetitive,"Have read the 2 sets of trilogies a while ago, I don't remember the story line being so labored. While Linden seemed to have had her fair share of a troubled history, she seems much more whiny and weak - physically & mentally in this book. I remember a more stable person.If you haven't read the first 2 sets, the labored repetition of select events over & over again, won't really give you the appreciation of the 1st 2 stories --> i.e. READ THE FIRST 2 TRILOGIES BEFORE READING THIS.If you did read the 1st 2 sets, definitely read this one and hope that Donaldson rediscovers his groove in the next book."
4,Miles Better Than Other Popular Dreck,"Phew, what a relief. Finally, some fantasy by not just a good writer but a great one. Someone with amazing command of structure, form, narrative, and character. The reviews giving just 1 or 2 stars have clearly not had the pleasure of having their standards bottom out w/ the likes of Rothfuss and Erikson; two authors whose mountains of good reviews persuaded me to give them a shot, but who fell way short once the spine was cracked.As for this final Covenant series, it's remarkably less depressing than the first two and for that I'm grateful."
3,Meh,"I've been a HUGE fan of Donaldson for years and love the original Covenant series, but I have to say I'm not feeling the love for the new books. Contrived, forced, and formulaic Donaldson in the extreme. Way too many characters and side dramas and no cohesive story. He can't even explain his own plot in the forwards BTW.""Runes of the Earth"" is the best of the three new books, but when you get to books 2 and 3... the story descends into an annoying drawn out mess of side plots on over dramatization (even for Donaldson). Not happy I'm going to have to suffer through a 4th one just to find out what happens. As soon as I'm done these books are getting donated and I'm never reading them again. If you love the originals.. you might want to avoid reading these.Donaldson needs treatment ASAP to cure his George Lucas syndrome."
1,Way to long and uninteresting,I have previously read all of the CTC and enjoyed them. So I bought this book thinking they would be as good. Sadly this one isn't. It's way too long and complicated. Too slow a read to be engaging.
3,The Ruling is still out,"I read the two previous trilogy concerning Thomas Covenant over 20 years ago. I was captivated by the story and characters. The world that Donaldson conceives was fresh and full of interesting creatures and beings.I was surprised to run across this book in my local library and had to read it. I was surprised how much of the preceeding stories I did not remember. A lot of the details were lost, and even with the explaination in the beginning of the book I still felt detached from the original stories.That being said, I struggled a little getting back up to speed with the chracters, and stories. I thought the story was very slow to get moving. This would have been expected if I came through it with a good feeling about the names, events, and places being refernced in the story.Luckily, the story started to clink for me and by the end of the book, I was ready for more. I am very glad (and surprised) that Donaldson decided to add another trilogy to an already classic tale."
3,"It's Donaldson, I'll give you that","Growing up, his first two chronicles was read through many a time. In fact, his was the impetus which brought me to fantasy. Here in his latest work, I have to admit, I wasn't as excited about it as I had anticipated. Maybe I've just matured, or my tastes have changed, or he has I don't know. Now, prior to this I had taken a chance on new author Brian S Pratt's debut into the genre, The Unsuspecting Mage. And though it had a few rough edges, which is to be expected I suppose from a new author, the story was compelling and hard to put down.It just seems many of the veterans are forgetting what it's like to be on the other side of the page. I personally read a book, not to improve my word capacity, but escapism fun. To just have a 'vacation' if you will from the mortal coils which bind us all.Overal I'd say this work is 'okay' If you like his works, you'll like this one, but unless you're a die-hard fan, another may be better for you"
3,Oh man!,"It pains me to say this, but this book just doesn't measure up to the earlier two series (which, except for the very inferior THE ONE TREE, are among my favorite books of all time). It might be that Mr. Stephenson has gone to the well once too often. So much of the first books seemed to wonderfully daring and inventive. But everything clever in this latest book is something taken from an earlier book. Yes, it's great to see these characters again, like visiting with old friends. But without the power of the earlier novels, this latest one would be almost a complete bust. (Mr. Donaldson, if you're reading this, I'm sorry! For the record, you changed my life before.)"
2,Time After Time,"The first Chronicles of Thomas Covenant were unique and breathtaking. The second Chronicles were not nearly as satisfying but at least Donaldson's ability to create fantasical creatures and situations made the books worth reading. Unfortunately, this seventh novel appears to simply recycle old ideas and characters that have been fully explored -- often using plot devices that defy even an indulgent reader from suspending disbelief. Indeed, with the exception of Donaldson's unusual style of writing prose, this novel seems to be what an avid fan of limited imagination would write if allowed to author a book in Donaldon's place. In short, Donaldson has returned to the land one time too many times given his ability to realize new characters and plot devices."
2,Disjointed at best,"I read the first two trilogies a few years ago, and I thought I remembered liking them pretty well, so I picked this book up. BIG mistake. The moral quandry that Linden finds herself in feels so forced and manufactured. I could get behind her if she could just make up her mind, for good or ill, but the flip flopping is distracting and exhausting to read. The charaacters are shallow and undeveloped. I never really feel anything about any of them. Generally, people who read scifi and fantasy novels aren't (in my experience) really big fans of moral relativism and this book is full of it. Go for it if you like that sort of thing!"
1,Couldn't finish it,"I've been a fan of Donaldson and I enjoyed the previous Thomas Covenant books. But this book struck me as very dumb. I kept reading for 200 pages, and all the while I thought, ""This book is so dumb.""Finally, I just gave up. Lord Foul the Despiser worked for me when I was a young teenager, but now.... he's a ridiculous character. The Land is lame. ""He has my son."" Who cares? Not me, although I tried. Reading this book was very unsatisfying."
1,For Donaldson Die-Hards Only,"Unlike many readers (as gauged by the reviews posted here on Amazon), I have not read the prior Thomas Covenant series of books . Instead, as I had done with Robin Hobb's excellent ""Fool's Errand"", I had hoped to read the first book from the new series and then, while awaiting book 2, read the first (2) series.Unfortunately, for me, that will not occur. Nor will a sojourn into book two (through a purported four) of this series.I found the primary protagonist (Lianden) unempathetic (perhaps even pathetic) and, worse, the author's general writing ponderous and... lacking.I, admittedly, can't attest to how this book stacks up to its predecessors. I can only state that compared to its contemporaries that I have read (Steven Erikson, Robin Hobb, George RR Martin, Robert Jordan, to name a few), I found that it didn't stack up well at all."
1,Very tedious and disappointing,"This story is even more plodding and repetitious than the previous Donaldson books. However with this story there is no compelling reason to overlook Donaldson's need to increase word counts. A story is lacking, the characters are dull reincarnations of other characters. The only real interest in this book is the character Anele.The story and the journey twist in meaningless tangles. Occasionally there is a glimpse of the work of a master story teller, but those glimpses are too few.The book feels very much like it was propelled by accountants checking off pages, events and features, rather than an artist striving to create.For engaging entertainment it would be far better to re-read the original Chronicles and leave this sad work alone."
4,Only two complaints . . .,". . . and they shouldn't stop you from reading this great book.First, Donaldson and the editors decided to use this book to recap what went on 20 years ago in the first 6 books. Wise decision? Perhaps, but it makes this book very wordy: too many pages of characters standing around and expounding on history.Second,(spoiler) there is time-travel. Personally, I hate time-travel stories. And in this book, at least, it appears unnecessary to the story line. Perhaps in the next book, the necessity will become apparent."
3,The Runes of the Earth,"Ok start for the final chronicles of Thomas Covenant. I think if you are not familiar with the original Thomas Covenant stories you might be a little bit confused by some of the references. Like the other stories in the chronicles it doesn't stand alone well, you need to go on to future volumes to get some answers. If you are not willing to actually pay attention to the details as the story progresses, this is not the book for you."
4,A worthy extension of a powerful series,"Donaldson returns to The Land. Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it. As with the original series I once again found myself staying up much too late because I couldn't put the book down. This is an excellent beginning to the next trilogy and Donaldson's writing is as powerful as ever. That said, I'm not convinced yet that this book is on par with the first series. The one difficulty is a time travel component that I find challenging to avoid over thinking the potential implications. The beginning struggled to reveal all that has gone before while moving forward. But, by the end the flow and the feelings I remember from the first series had fully returned. I look forward to the remainder of the series and hope that I do not have to wait for book 3."
5,Gap series plot complexity for the Covenant series!,"My review may contain spoilers.Having recently re-read the 6 prior books as well as the gap series in less than 2 months (and thus having fairly good recall on style/quality of writing of all of them still), all I can say is that Donaldson has brought the plot complexity (multiple factions with diverse interests) of the Gap series to the Land.There is no more black-and-white Foul and Despite vs. almost everyone else anymore, unlike the previous covenant books (exception - the elohim in the 2nd series, but to a limited degree). A reader who has not read the gap books and thus become familiar with the growth in the author's talent for plot design may in fact not like this book initially.I do find Linden's voice/style to remind me of Morn Hyland."
4,Let's do the time warp again.........,"My review short but sweet---Stephen R Donaldson STILL writes like a guy who got a thesaurus for Christmas, but I don't care-I'm glad he's back! It starts a bit slow, builds nicely, and the last sentence alone makes it worth the slow beginning. Can't wait for the next one!"
3,The redundant abuse of vocabulary words is actually annoying...,"If I read puissance, formication or theurgy again, I think my head will explode! Instead of the brief feeling of accomplishment for knowing what a rarely used word means, the annoyance lingers on long after I put the book down as they are repeated over and over and over. I certainly understand the desire for precision in terminology, but the FLOW and CADENCE of the prose just doesn't fit -puissance evokes power in my mind, alright --Powerful ODOR. Add to that, the introduction of an omnipotent character (Esmer) to appear and miraculously save plot threads that get themselves lost, is intellectually dismissive (I'm just an average reader, but I am certain there must be a critical term for this literary short cut). I'm 450 pages into the book and just needed to vent... I read the first editions back in 1978, others as they arrived and only recently discovered this last trilogy had been written."
4,Shows you academy life,"This was a great book and it realy got me more interested in The Air Force Academy than I was before. I can not wait until my plebe year, and to be involved in Air Force football."
1,Don't bother,"Either I got a dud, or this is the weakest darn ""vacuum"" I've ever used. Basically, I had to hold it upright and drop things into it to get it to ""vacuum."" Save your money."
1,Disappointed,"I have two battery operated vacuums. One is B&D ""Dust Buster"" and the other is the Delonghi ""Aspira"". The B&D is by far the better vacuum. The battery charge lasts longer and the vacuum is stronger on the B&D. I think the B&D also has a better filter. I have had the B&D 2 years and the Delonghi 1 year. The B&D is still going strong while the motor has failed on the Delonghi and the battery no longer holds a charge. I noticed fine dust that sucked through the filter on the Delonghi coating the impeller blade. I assume that is what caused a binding in the bushing of the cheap impeller motor."
5,timeless,A beautiful compilation of great standards. Very smooth & romantic mirroring the likes of Nat king Cole and Johnny Mathis..A true joy!
5,EEEK!!,"Right. You wanna boogie, you buy this album. Every track's a stonker. Specially Dr. Jazz and Bumble Boogie (which I just had to learn, even though it took 9 months). What are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW!"
2,disappointed in Stanley products,"I tried to save a few dollars in purchasing a number of Stanley products....what a foolish mistake.....I should have gone with the better products (Klein, for example)....this is nothing beyond mediocre."
2,Too big and heavy,"It is too big and too heavy for me too use, I have arthritis really bad in my hands and fingers. I thought it would be a lot smaller. They should have had a picture like this one in the submit add and then I would have known it was to big."
3,Taught my myself LotusScript...,"I did manage to teach my self LotusScript using this book, but it wasn't easy. It's very well structured, almost like a reference book. Its weakest point however is the lack of a good index, the one it contains is far from complete. Thus making it a bad reference. I would like to see a either that the authors make a more didactic revision of it, or make it into to a reference book with a better index. As it is now, it's not good enough for either or. I can't say that I've seen any better LotusScript selfstudy books though, so I would still have to recommend it."
1,Watse of money,Do not buy this book. It does not teach you anything. It is like a reference manual that is not different than yellow books. If you are not familiar with class etc. buy the book called Practical Lotus Scripot by Patton. It will give you good start. That is all you need to start coding lotusScript and if you need more deatiled info on any subject you can always use the excellent online help of LotusNotes.
1,"Regretfully, this book ruins 600+ pages of good paper.","The first 100 pages start out decently if somewhat incoherent in its approach. Unfortunately it then gets into a pattern of:Here's a method or property, Here's a trivial and useless syntax example. See Lotus documentation for details.Repeat for 600 pages.I can only assume that the editors didn't understand the content enough to be able to tell how badly this book is put together."
4,A good reference,"I am the LotusScript specialist at my work, along with doing general Notes support, Notes Administration, SMTP MTA Administartion, and some applications development in Notes. I did fine just refering to the On-line help to start, but now I find I am doing too many things, and a reference I can look at anywhere is more valuable than expected. I look up stuff I need, and browse it for stuff I may need in the future. I may go weeks without doing any script, then need to do nothing but script for a couple days. I keep it handy, even carrying it home and back to work."
2,A waste of money,"Don't waste your money. To learn LotusScript, believe me, you just need Lotus Notes's Help. It is great. It provides you with all LotusScript explanation you need as well as good examples. When I bought this book, I've started reading it and doing it's exercises. I couldn't progress. Then, I've decided to give a try on Note's Help. From there on everything started to work beautifully. Now, thanks to Notes Help, and thanks only to it, I've definitely learned LotusScript."
2,"Use for reference, not ""Teach Yourself""",I think the title of this book is very misleading. I would never refer to it as a teaching aid. It is merely a reference tool; no better or worse than the online help. As a professional computer consultant with 7+ years of Visual Basic programming experience I was still dissapointed in how little skill I was able to obtain from this book.
3,Good reference but no concepts,"I bought this book after having 3 weeks script experience and found it to be slightly confusing even at that point. The content, although accurate and thorough offered no explanation of fundamental coding concepts. Furthermore the book spends a lot of time dealing with the various available objects but spends little time on the actual language constructs. If you already understand the Lotus Notes object model or perhaps some other object model, then this book might be ok for you. If not, I reccommend trying to find something which will explain the the afore-mentioned concepts in greater detail."
2,Rocky is the man,"I had the pleasant opportunity to know more about how and why this book was written. I will say this Rocky Oliver is a Lotus Notes god. I've worked with him for a number of years. I know what the man is capable of. I am sure that if Rocky had more direction in the content of this book, I'd give it 5 stars (Rocky when is your book coming out?) However, back to the subject. Notes Help is much better."
4,I use it everyday (as a reference).......enough said!!!,"A reference book rather that a TY. But that said, better than Lotus' offerings. Could have had a steeper learning curve for the TY side."
2,"Just a reference book, that's all","This is book is basically the different version of Lotus' own progremmer's guide and language reference. If you have those two, i don't recommend buying this book. It doesn't offer anything newer than those two books that comes from Lotus. If you don't have ""Programmer's Guide"" and ""Language Reference"" you can order them from Lotus. They are better.However, if you don't have Lotus manual, I guess this book will do the trick."
2,Some value among the cliches,"I was fairly underwhelmed by this book; it seems to use Jesus as a ""unifying thematic element"", but to take a fairly free hand in ""massaging"" the story of His life to fit the author's idea of leadership. Overall, although the book does have some value in inspiring introspection, reading The Daily Drucker (and anything else of Drucker's) in combination with the Bible will give you a much better picture of leadership and of how Jesus led, and will likely be more inspirational to effective action than will this book."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book. I was searching for ways to improve myself since I had about 1 more week at my job, I am going through a crummy relationship, and my grandmother(a 2nd mother to me), just passed away 1 week before christmas. This book explored many areas of my life which desperately needed improvement. After reading the 1st chapter, I felt energized and could hardly wait to get things together in my life. I believe in myself now and feel that Jesus is behind me all of the way. It also made me feel more connected with Jesus because this book uses him as the ultimate example. This book is not only a ""manual"" for success, it's also a book of comfort. Thank you Laurie Beth..excellent job."
1,"Elementary, 3 page chapters, For NOVICE LEADERS/READERS","I had greater expectaions and was hoping to learn some new theories/thoughts about management, nothing new found in this book. This book could be o.k. for the NOVICE manager/reader. It didn't take much visionary leadership to understand the authors thoughts. Extremely basic, like i.e. ""He formed a team"" The chapters consist of an average of three (3) pages. I rated this book 1 star,I was surprised there wasn't any pictures? However, the Bible is an excellent source with management dealings, stick with it!"
2,"Undoubtedly well intentioned, but biased.","The book starts well and has some real gems and insights. She interprets the bible from her own Christian point of view and for her own purposes. No problem, we all do this. But I consider my God to embody the very best of both men and women and the steady undercurrent of gender bias in this book was disturbing, especially given the high ambition of its title. A letdown"
1,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","One wonders how a corporare board would react when the disccovered that Jesus-CEO had put Mark 10:21 into effect as a corporate policy.Really, this has to be the dumbest title in history."
1,Review of Reviews,"I'm glad to hear that the crackpot religious types didn't like this book much. A prospective employer mentioned it, and I'm glad to find out that he's probably not some whacked-out Jesus freak."
2,"Dissappointing, full of error and new age 'spirituality'.","There was very little in this book that would be useful for leading anyone to Christ, which is what Godly leadership is all about. Scripture was used out of context in far too many places. Never was an emphasis made on encouraging a personal relationship with Christ. There is no way that a person can SUCCESSFULLY use the concepts that Christ taught without KNOWING Him personally. There was lots of talk about being spiritual, but NONE about knowing the Holy Spirit. I would highly recommend, instead, James Hunter's ""The Servant""."
2,shipping,"I am normally very pleased with your service. But, in this case, I paid extra for overnight delivery and will not receive the books until next week. I think the extra money I paid for shipping needs to be refunded! The book is a great book, its Amazon's service that is disappointing."
4,"Jesus, CEO","I really like this book! It has a lot of helpful wisdom for business builders. I found that, because I am a Christian, there was much in this book that I could relate to in regard to using the teachings of Jesus to help me develop a strong business!"
5,Inspires change and insightfullnes,"As a CEO myself, I will attest to the excellent inspiration that it relays to the executive. The chapters are short and to-the-point. I recommend keeping it in your desk and reading a chaptera day or so to develop more insight into the leadership technique that worked for God.As I learned from reading the text, I realized the wisdom of Christ is not really ancient at all...but are simple lessons in interacting with and leading people that are timeless in nature.This book could change the nature of our corporations and World if it were required reading for business leaders....The only thing that the author didn't emphasize more is the importance of communicating with our boss, Jesus, through prayer, and constantly asking for his guidance in our actions. He will makes us stronger and abler leaders."
5,Practical Applications Oriented as well as Wisdom Filled,"Laurie Beth Jones breaks her discussion of Jesus' Ancient Wisdom of Leadership into three sections: Self Mastery, Action and Relationships.The short, punchy chapters in this book make it the perfect daily companion. I really appreciate how Jones shares examples and illustrations from Bible references as well as bringing in people like Georgia O'Keefe and Dan Millman and others.Each chapter concludes with a question or two (several have quite a few) which allow the integration and application of the principles in that chapter. I could definitely see taking a chapter a day and really studying and applying as I go about living my life, working my business, etc."
5,"Wow, read it, share it, enjoy it!","One of the best books I've ever read, re-read and read again. I continuously go back to this book for inspiration and level setting when I'm grumpy about the world and believe everyone is rotten and spoiled. This book is a great how to be a good person leadership read."
4,"Jesus, CEO good ideas for management",I liked it. It includes some excellent ideas about communicating and motivating oneself and others. It is particularly applicable for the Christian as the author uses Jesus as the example for each of her vignettes.
5,Great Gift idea,I bought this book at a used book store because it 'looked' interesting. Since reading and throughly enjoying this book I have purchased many copies for friends and colegues. This book is worth any time and effort that you put into it. A must read.
3,Some good Points but not much ground-breaking information,"This book was fairly well written with some interesting and helpful points. The idea of using Jesus as the main subject of assessment in this book is a good choice in my view. However, I finished the book without being able to say that anything I read REALLY struck a chord or at least made me say ""this is great stuff!""The information within the book made sense but it was a bit trite in certain instances. I would recommend it to a College student but I don't think it would have much use to an experienced Business man."
4,Very entertaining fast read,"The McNally books are sexy, witty, and fun mysteries. The answers to the questions raised are surprising enough. For a fast, entertaining read, go for McNally."
3,Am I the only one who is bothered by this?,"I've read the first 4 books in the McNally's series in sequence. They're all highly formulaic but still enjoyable.In the first 3 books the main character is a lovable rogue, mostly amoral but still with certain personal limits, so it is not surprising that he sleeps with various available women in the first 3 books.But -- SPOILER ALERT -- in the 4th book he sleeps with a woman who is married, living with her husband and planning to continue that way. And -- lest you think that he was momentarily carried away by passion -- he sleeps with her two more times.Suddenly, to this reviewer at least, McNally becomes a less lovable and much more unattractive figure."
4,kept me reading,I hemmed over the purchase of the book. When I started to read it [My first Sanders book] I was delighted by the characters. No one is what they seem. The first impression is stereotypes but I found that everyone had depths that you would never have attributed to them [Peaches too]. Archie who seems as feather headed as they come and is up there with the best.The plot twists are tied together neatly leaving a satisfied feeling at the end. While looking for other McNally's books I discovered that Lawrence Sanders had died. I felt the disappointment I feel when I find that one of my favorite authors has died. It says a lot on the first book to get that feeling.I almost turned it down when I read the reviews if you love Block you'll love this. I hate Block. I love Sanders. I plan on reading the rest of Sander's McNally books and plan on the others too. It was a pleasing suprise. Try it you might be also pleased and suprised.
4,"When ""Tension"" is released, expect quality","Their third and final album as a group, ""Release Some Tension"" almost measured up to the their 1992 smash ""It's About Time."" SWV's sultry vocals help carry some of the weaker tracks like ""Lose Myself"" and ""Here For You."" But it's songs like ""Rain,"" and ""Release Some Tension,"" that make this CD shine. In addition, their unique collaboration with E-40 on ""Come And Get Some"" proves worthy. Overall, this album served as a clear reminder of their staying power -- if only they were promoted right."
4,Liked the collaborations with rappers on this one!,"I thought that Release Some Tension was very well done. It has more of a hip-hop feel and set the tone for the current collaboration trend of R&B singers and rappers. Someone has that jumper-cable type feel and Puffy gave them a good beat and sound for them. Puffy's lyrics are a little silly, but they complement the song (Plush Oriental rugs and platinum plaques/ Come On?!--lame)The ones with Redman, Missy Elliott (Can We), Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, Snoop Dogg and others are so funky and SWV sound very good all throughout. They remember to include their smooth ballads, especially the reflective Rain and the other few in the second half. Release does move very fast in its pace, but is better than their '96 album where they tried to change too much. This album, they have a lot more fun with the street edge of the songs."
5,STILL BANGIN!!!,swv was and still is my fav group and this cd stil Hooootttt !!!even though they split in 98 but heyyy at least there back on track as friends and that's a start!!!!
1,Boring..........,"This album in my opinion is a waiste of time. Coko, the group's alto, shines as usually,but the poor selection of tracks don't fit there profile. There are a few good moments.... the Missy Elliot produced ""Can We"", ""Lose Myself"", ""Lose my Cool"" and two inspiring ballads, ""rain"" and ""when u cry"", but the album lacks with swv's characters."
4,Love eau des merveilles,"I just love this product by Hermes. It isn't overpowering, and not too sweet smelling. The price wasn't too bad either."
1,From Hell Itself - Phony Christians Selling Rock Music,"Phony Christians, those that show up in church every Sunday after a week of debauchery, will love this crap. Their faith is so transparent, that they have to completely immerse themselves in their dogma. Consequently, there is a market for this non-rock music. People who care how ""god-fearing"" other people percieve them to be will lap this garbage up. God does'nt care about how many bibles your music thumps, she really does'nt.""This is great rock music"" they tell their neighbors before they head downtown to the S/M club for their weekly flogging, thinking ""That'll fool them."" - You hypocrites are'nt fooling anyone.No sane person wants to be preached to 24/7 - truly religious peo[le can live in a normal society and they make it better. This is noise for pinheads and zeolots."
4,Easy to use easy to install,"We've had a Moen water purifier installed 3 years ago for a summer residence and it has worked perfectly. We have a dedicated tap and we change the filter each year, It is a 5 minute job once you read the instructions and pretty fail safe. The first time I changed it I had a little too much water under the sink but now that I know to hold the filter completely level it has been no problem at all. It is an expensive filter to replace but the water tastes great."
3,Good Filter but expensive,This is a good filter but expensive compared to similar filter from other manufacturers. I am stuck with the Moen filter hardware and have no choice than buying this.It will be better to check the price of refill cartridge's before going for a filter system.
4,works great,I like the flavor etc....my one comment is I wish these things were easier to replace...
3,Are these worth it?,"These items have to be replaced frequently enough that I sometimes wonder if they are worth bothering with, given that they are not cheap ($50). Having said this, if you have a system that uses this filter and wish to replace it, this was the best place to buy the replacement cartridge!"
4,A Fascinating Tale of Discovery,"Moving Target succeeds in transforming what could be a pedestrian topic into a fascinating tale of discovery. Ron Arias manages masterfully to make the reader a committed member of the author's family and his relentless quest to uncover the truth.Arias accomplishes this considerable feat with an effective approach composed of painful candor, suspense and clean, compelling writing."
1,Don't work,These bags do not fit properly and don't make a seal.To make them work at all you have to push the rubber seal onto the plastic fitting.Not worth it and could potentially damage your vacuum...
5,Great Tool,"I bought this to vacuum the leaves out of my window wells. From there I used it in the yard and gutters. It did a great job, and I used the mulched leaves to cozy flowers in for our long North Dakota winters. It became quite popular with the neighbors as well... In all I feel that it has already paid back the investment several times over."
5,SO EASY!!!!,"This blower had to be, by far, the easiest thing I've put together in years. I had it out of the box, assembled and my 3 car garage and driveway were clean in less than an hour total. I used it on the lowest speed and the blower completely cleaned all the debris out of my garage with ease. The blower is not too loud and was, of course, fumelss while I was working. I haven't used the mulcher yet but it appears to be simple enough just by reading the instructions. This has been a great investment for me! And a great surprise for my husband who came home and found a spotless garage."
5,Best Customer Service experience ever!!,"I agree, This is the best electric blower in the market.Mine, for some reason was defective,one day just stopped working.Called Toro Customer Service, very nice people on the phone, even though I tried to explain the problem, no questions asked, they told me to send it back.One week later the new blower was here. This one works perfectly.I cannot remember a customer service experience as smooth and quick as this one.Very nice job Toro,Thank you!!"
2,don't overload it,I have had the unit for about 2+ years. It is a very good 'blower'. For the first time in the 2 years I've owned it I decided to vacuum some leaves. There must have been a clump of wet ones that got sucked up into it. Within seconds the motor began to burn up. I noticed one of the blades had broken too. With the broken blade it caused it to be unbalanced and consequently did not function well. Conclusion: good blower but be wary of using it as a vacuum.
1,Burned up Three!,First one lasted 5 minutes. Second one lasted 10 minutes. Third one has between 1 and 2 hours of total runtime over a year and just burned up. No more Toro Rake & Vac's for me.
2,Bag is inferior,I bought this unit 6 months ago and the bag's zipper broke after just a few uses. It is made very cheaply and when it breaks it makes the unit useless for vac. Mechanically it has been fine.
5,Blower/vacuum,"I love this thing. One of my best purchases yet. Has power, is well made and easy to use."
4,HIPSWAY,"Without a bad track on the album hipsway is an excellant trip back to mid-eighties electronic pop/rock ,with its crisp, clear production songs like 'the honeythief','the broken years' and my personal favourite 'forbidden' amazingly has passed the test of time. bass player johnny mcelone who already had a taste of fame with his former band ALTERED IMAGES would go on to have phenomenal success throughout the u.k and europe with his new band TEXAS."
5,Superb performer,"Back home the first Sumeet my dad brought lasted for more than 12 years without a single repair. Finally when it died an electrician who brought the broken one from me fixed the coil and it was good to go. What did I do? I brought a new sumeet the very same day and its 4 years now and mom says it still rules.What I like about it+ Super strong construction+ Simple to use with a load protection switch+ If something goes wrong you get spares. You don't have to throw away the blender for a small part.+ lasts longer than any US brand that I have seen so far.+ As for power, it can take a kitchen aid for breakfast and black dekker for lunch and still have appetite for a couple of sun beams. Trust me folks on this.+ Jar locking mechanism.+ A whole bunch of attachments that come with it.What I don't like is the price. Sumeet has always been on the expensive side. But once you get years of service the price doesn't hurt that much any more.Update: 2008..Its still going strong."
1,Not worth the money at all,"Growing up we always had a Sumeet and they worked great. When I moved to the U.S., I bought a Sumeet and used it for 10 years but the jars started falling apart. But that machine can grind. So I recently replaced it with a brand new Sumeet. This one seems to be so poorly made. The finish on the product is pretty poor. But, I am really focused on function here, so decided to use it. The unit just cannot handle the grinding. When I used the new Asia Grinder, it just kept tripping. And, I was trying to grind only half a jar full. So it was definitely not overloaded. I had to keep resetting the load protector. It is not easy to try and get to the reset button. So I just took the new jar with the contents and used it with my old Sumeet. Coincidentally it fits well on the old Sumeet grinder and it worked great - It ground very fine.This new machine is terrible and I wouldn't spend the money on it. My sister bought the same machine and she has the same issues."
1,Don't WASTE your money on this one!,"Unfortunately we purchased this item before doing our research and looking for online customer product reviews. Hence, my taking the time to write a review for you.... We got this primarily for the alarm clock feature and now have decided to not use it at all and resort to using our cell phone alarm clock! The sound quality is good - but you CANNOT set a volume to your alarm clock other than the preset volume at level ""15"". So whether you are using songs, buzz, or radio, your alarm clock will sound off at an alarmingly LOUD volume and wake up your entire house! RIDICULOUS - That there is no volume feature on this! We even called the manufacturer's customer service and they confirmed you cannot control the volume of the alarm feature -- so why put this feature on there at all? There are many other quality products in the market for the same price. I do not reccomend purchasing this one."
3,The King Brothers sing some great covers,"The King Brothers were very talented. I think the best song on this CD by far is ""The Coffee Song."" It is pure fun and good energy."
2,udder balm from Cattyvet Pet Supply,They sent the wrong product and didn't respond to email about problem.order from aubuchon hardware instead if you need Dionne udder balm.They sent the correct product!! This product is absolutely wonderful -- don't accept substitutes!!
4,My girls love these.,I have two a kitten and a puppy. Both my girls love them and yes they are cute.
4,stified with cultery and beyound,"Even though this knife is not made in germany like the ad tries to put out there, I was happy with my knives and the company was very helpfull in explaining how the process works on the german blade but processed in china .I still have a life time guarantee.J.A. Henckels International Everedge 13-Piece Knife Set with Bonus Cheese Knife"
5,Henckel knives,"I received my set of Henckel knives seven years ago and I just love them. I have never had to sharpen them. My son and his wife received a different brand for their wedding, and they are dull and tips are bent after only a few years of use. I bought these as a Christmas gift for them knowing they will last a long time."
4,Fine set of knives,"Great knives, very sharp out of the package. Attractive set.The reason for the 4 stars:Slightly pricey considering it's not a top of the line set. The weight of the knife isn't perfectly balanced, but a good set to keep at home."
5,International Fine Edge Pro 13 Piece Block Cutlery Set,Knives are sharp and the organizing block helps to keep them safely away from fingers! The scissors is a very handy tool.
4,Great knives....,Great knives! The only thing I could ask for would be better handles; they get a bit slick under certain circumstances.
3,Just ok,"Finaly , got my wife that nice knife set on the kitchen counter top for Christmas .After few days of use, knives were not as sharp as first day !!Have to sharpen them pretty often if you really want great cuts.The meat dinning set is useless to me. I wanted kitchen knives and not for table. We already have some other good and nice knives for the table. I did not realize that when i bought it. I thought they were all kitchen knives which means that we mostly use only 2 or 3 of those knives in the kitchen.Make sure you check what you need and what is in this set."
2,Henckels from China,I wanted Henckels knives because of the superior quality of its German Steel. The set looks great and at a great price but I was extremely disappointed to find out that this set is not from Germany but from China. I understand that most companies do outsource but I expected that at the least the item description would tell you that these knives are from China and not from Germany.
3,Henckels,"Henckels. What can I say. Very functional. When I buy knives as a gift, I always choose Henckels because once is enough and that's the end of it. You never have to buy again."
5,Simple and Delicious,I've cooked this dish for many people and have gotten amazing feedback from everyone. It's a simple and excellent meal.
4,Long & Strong,"Great price, great tool. It's much longer than I imagined, and heavy, but I guess that's the point. It's painted yellow on the curved end, and black everywhere else. It'll stand up to a lot of use - and abuse."
3,"Good quality, less than detailed description","As promised, a solid ripping bar with real weight. Only problem is final product is bright yellow for visibility, which isn't in the description and not what is shown."
2,"Wow, how can you get this wrong?","The business end is s stumpy that you cant get it under anything that you want to pry open unless there is like a 3/4"" gap or larger....forget pulling nails or screws with this"
1,Poor quality,"There are some breath-taking views in this book. However, most of the photos are ruined by absolutely horrible color processing and production. I'm assuming most of the washed out, brownish tints come from a shoddy production process, but who knows. I was very, very disappointed that most every picture was ruined by such poor color reproduction. Find another book on the island."
3,Tote bag,This is a very good and sturdy bag. I used it in a craft project that had iron-on's. The only down side to it (for me) is that the straps are made with plastic or something and the iron did a little damage.
3,Good tips and insight but enough with your own stories..,"Yes, this book is helpful and does give tips for the struggling writer.. But as I was reading, I just kept getting annoyed at the author.. He kept bring up his own work and giving long examples of his stories to give his point. Yes, from one standpoint I can see that being logical.. but after a while you just want to say ""Give me more examples from OTHER authors!"".. which he does, in little doses. I just couldn't help but feel like the author was plugging his own work."
2,Countering Those 5-Star Reviews,"I collect not only Hendrix music but also Hendrix tributes and was pretty shocked to see three 5-star reviews on this disc. I could be talked into giving this one 3 stars, but that's about it. It just doesn't move me. Jimi tributes are always an uphill battle in my opinion. Artists often avoid trying to play a song similar to the way Jimi played it and it's easy to see why - just who are you going to get that can touch the feel he put into the guitar playing and singing?Don't get me wrong - I'm a bigtime fan of Band of Gypsys and have no axe to grind with Buddy at all. I'm so happy he was there to help Jimi out in '69 and '70 when he was so in need of TLC. But this disc just does not, to me, evoke the soul of Jimi as much as I'd expected."
3,Feeder Usage,The feeder is constructed well and holds a good amount of sunflower seeds. My problem is that it is an excellent squirrel feeder. The cardinals came and vanished as the squirrels took over and feed non-stop. They are interesting to watch but I wanted the cardinals.
4,A lot better than the other kind,"(The other kind of wire mesh feeder has a top held on with a decorative nut/ring arrangement -- the nut holds the top on, and the ring attaches the feeder to whatever it's hung from. The first thing raccoons learn as children is how to spin the feeder so that the nut unscrews, the feeder drops to the ground, the top flies off, and the raccoon family eats.)These hourglass feeders use a different design. The top is held on with latches so they're raccoon-proof (at least until the raccoons learn how to deal with the latches). They hold about 25% more seed, and the birds seem to like them. About the only disadvantage to this design is that you have to hold them up with one hand while you fill them."
4,It is a squirrel feeder.,"It is a squirrel feeder! They hang from it and sit on top. When they are hanging out the birds are not. Otherwise the cardinals and finches do feed. I have not seen other large birds, which is okay. Does hold a lot of sunflower seed.The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of 5, is because the squirrels consider it their dinner plate, thou I enjoy watching their antics too!"
3,NO/No Bird feeder just ok,"Difficult to refill, lose alot of seed in the process. Birds seem to like it and so do the squirrels. At least it doesn't break when they knock it off its hook."
2,Hard for the birds to eat,"I purchased the ""No/No Hourglass Bird Feeder"" and I was unhappy with the results. The birds had difficulty getting the sunflower seeds through the mesh. After a couple days of watching the birds struggle to extract the seeds, I returned the product. On a plus side, the build quality seemed to be of a high quality."
5,Okay Where's The Jukebox?,"Most of these songs on here, I have heard Elvis Presley sing before, and there are some that I never heard him perform before I got this cd. The songs that I have never heard Elvis Presley sing before includes, Good Rockin' Tonight, I Got Stung, She's Not You and Way Down. Others like Heartbreak Hotel, Don't Be Cruel, All Shook Up, Stuck On You, It's Now Or Never, Little Sister, Suspicious Minds, Hound Dog, (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear that I heard Mr. Presley sing before."
2,This Is One I could pass up On,"How many times can BMG/RCA repackage Elvis Cd's? I have over 1400 albums and this one is my least favorite. These songs have been rehashed hundreds of times over the years. If your a novice fan that does not have one Elvis Cd, this one is for you. But if you have several cd's, you could forget about this poor release, the package is very cheaply put together. Even the song selection could be better. This cd is not for collector's but for the NEW Elvis fan, someone who does not have one single ELVIS Album."
4,classic 80's english pop,"love plus one and favorite shirts are two of the most well known of this groups hits but the other trscks offer more examples of the english horn sound that the ""cut"" had been known and loved for...a must have for those of us thirty somethings that grew up with the uplifting sounds of ""the cut"""
3,not haircut 100,"if you're a big haircut 100 fan, beware. nick heyward's solo material isn't nearly as good as haircut 100. if you don't have the expanded pelican west just get that. if you have the orginal pelican west, this does add some nice mixes of haircut 100 songs."
3,meh,It's a good read with one of my favorite super heroes: Cassandra Cain. The binding had seen better days but nothing terrible. It is a used book after all.
4,Good follow up to war Games,"I was out of comics for a while, and picked this Graphic Novel, great way to catch up! Batman finally gets some answers following the WAR GAMES saga"
3,"Not a bad book, despite the art","This tale of the aftermath of Rha's al Ghul's death is great for fans of the character. It provides some excellent insights into his motivations and origins. I don't think it will be spoiling things to tell you he was always nuts! The tale is told between flashbacks to the past and scenes in modern Gotham, where people have become mysteriously unable to die. Besides an overly brisk pace, my problem with this book is the art. The artist does not have a good understanding of the human body, resulting in many panels where people have oversized heads. Look for it and you'll see it. Also, despite the ""Year One"" in the title, there was no direct connection with Batman Year One, a disappointment. Anyway, still a good read if those quibbles don't bother you."
5,"Excellent, well-rounded approach to studying!","As a Microsoft Certified Trainer and college instructor for over eight (8) years, I have collected (and actually read; ) *many* study guides. This series by Syngress Media Inc/Osborne, McGraw-Hill stands out well above the rest. The ""Two Minute Drill"" sections at the end of each chapter are exceptional for last minute study, right before you sit for your exams. There are only two minor drawbacks to this set: 1) length (necessary for full proper coverage of W2K; 2) CD audio (brief at best). I highly recommend ""Self Test Software"" and ""AudioWhiz"" audio training CDs to bring you over the top. Best of Luck with your studies, and remember to consider getting this series for help!"
2,A mixed bag,"The network (70-216) book itself rates four stars becuase it fairly thoroughly covers the material tested on the exam.The AD book (70-217) itself rates three stars because it misses some key areas.The workstation (70-210) and server (70-215) books miss broad expanses of test material, so although they may not be bad introductions to Windows 2000, they are grossly inadequate for exam preparation. Further, the two books are virtual carbon copies of each other.Overall, I was troubled by the lack of editing and several major factual errors.Please note that some of the other reviews are by authors and editors. At least they had the integrity to sign their names."
2,"More like a windows manual, Has nothing to do with the exam!","Please for God's sake stop saying these books are good, I studied from the first book for the exam 70-210 and I check what I studied with the self test software and transcender and what I got, NOTHING FROM THESE BOOKS COMES IN THE REAL QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!, I am terribly sorry to admit that I was fooled by the reviews written here by the author and his family, I wish I can return the books but unfortunately I am in Cairo, Egypt and shipping fees are so expensive so the sum that will be returned is not worth returning the books. please stick to the microsoft training kit, they are the exam authors and they know what will come and dont be fooled by the reviews written by the authors of the booksSherif"
3,fluffy and wordy,"I'm only halfway through the 2000 professional book, and I'm already regretting my purchase of the set. The information is not presented in a clear consise manner, and I've noticed some minor mistakes. All in all, if you're actually interested in avoiding forking out re-test money, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Being certified only means that you could memorize braindump,"However, if you actually want to learn something, then these books are a good reference point. The ""Exam questions"" that are included are nothing like what are on the Microsoft exams, but by simply going to mcsebraindumps.com you can get loads of ""sample"" questions."
1,Don't buy these Books!!!,Poorly written and filled with errors. It is a huge waste of money to buy these books. The guides from the Microsoft press are much better and what I would recommend.
3,A lot of mistakes,"I pass this exam just with 720, the has a lot of mistakes be aware of them, like the swithes in the windows2k installation, but in general this is a good book, complete your material with the Microsoft Readiness Review and a Transcender and you are just fine, cYA..."
3,Helpful but not full featured.,"The quality of this set makes it worth every penny for beginners, but its information could have been presented out more efficiently. The Professional and Server books cover a lot of the same ground in their first few chapters. In particular, the Server book goes into a fair amount of depth about setting up the RIS (Remote Installation Services), then informs you that RIS doesn't work with Server images only with Pro images. The DNS information included in this setting is lacking in clarity and depth but still has enough information to get you up and running. The directory services information in this set is good starter material for people who haven't had any experience with Active Directory (or any other LDAP based service). In the end, you will definitely need to purchase the Microsoft Server Resource Kit to get any ""real world"" information, but if you are looking to pass tests, this set will do the job (barely)."
3,Errata,"This book is an easy read and performs well in walking the reader through the step by step excercises. I have found a few errors in syntax examples such as the RIS switches between winnt and winnt32. I noticed these errors, how many more are that I did not notice?"
2,Dissapointing,"I read Firewing because Sunwing and Silverwing were great. I loved the characters of Shade and Marina, and even Goth. But Firewing is definately not worth buying. Sunwing has a satisfying ending, and you don't need to waste your time reading a story that's hard to keep track of, doesn't add up, and has the most dissapointing ending of any book I ever read. Please, take my advice and pick a different book."
4,AGHHHH!!,The book is great. Just great. Except for the ending. I can't believe so many reviewers actually liked the ending. It was the most disappointing thing ever. Don't read it if you love happy endings. There had better be a fourth book to resolve this feeling of being cheated in me ><
1,A Disapointment,"This book was way too hyped. I bought it because Sunwing and Silverwing were really, really, good. But when I started to read Firewing, it got boring. The ending, I thought, was way too sad. Sorry, but you shouldn't waste your money or time on this book. If you still want to read it, borrow it from the library. I'm sorry but I just didn't like this book."
3,Dads favorite book,"I loved this book because it reminds me of my dad and me, when we used to go through out the Manhattan Trails in Grand Rapids. I loved it and my dad taught me how to ski, and snowboard there just like papa bear did to his son. I just loved it the way that they spent time together. And I cant wait to go to see my dad in the winter and we can go do the same things that we do in the winter."
3,Reese Jeep Receiver Hitch,"Quality Control needs to be addressed... My unit did not fit against frame rails properly. It was off by 5/16 of an inch. My Jeep's frame spacing was dead-on. So, I was forced to take the receiver, turn it on end and open the ears of it using my garden tractor's rear blade as a wedge. Sloppy cutting/welding was the culprit."
3,"Welding splash, lacks mount for Moper 7-wire receptacle","First impression: I was disappointed by the amount of welding splash on the tube.Final results: I returned the hitch to pay more for the stock Moper version as I purchased the 7-wire wiring harness that bolts into the stock hitch.The Reese version would have looked good with my polish stainless steel tube bumper, but I needed the stock mount for the 7-wire receptacle. Furthermore, I did not care for the weld splash (the stock Moper hitch did not have the splash)."
5,Perfect,Fit like a dream only took a few minutes to install! Price was very good. Thanks it worked out great!
2,Beware: this item comes without any decanters/carafes.,Beware: this item comes without any decanters/carafes. Even though the picture shows 2 decanters this product does not come with any.
1,Do not buy BUNN equipment,"A cautionary tale for those people considering buying a BUNN product:I purchased a BUNN Granita machine from Bunn on May 23, 2012. One week after receiving it, one side stopped working (I was using both sides for frozen lemonade). I took it to the repair guy *assuming* that it would be covered by the warrantee as it had only worked for a week. BUNN declined to fixed the machine, so I ended up having to get it fixed for an additional $320 charge.DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM BUNN - THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. IF IT BREAKS - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF COMMERCIAL MACHINES - GO WITH THEM INSTEAD."
5,BUNN coffee maker,I am an old fashioned coffee drinker. I like coffee grounds from a can and this makes the perfect coffee in quick time.
1,"Blows hot air, but doesn't heat","We purchased this item to help heat the living room area of our home. The reviews were good so we were excited to receive it. When my husband removed it from the box he noticed something rattling around in the base of the unit. We plugged it in & were pleased that it immediately started blowing hot air. The tempurature in the room was 70, so we set the heater to 78 to see if we could really get the room toasty. Unfortunately within 30 minutes of having the unit on the room tempurature had dropped to 68. Not sure if the rattling had something to do with it or not, but it seems odd for the unit to blow hot air but not heat the room. This is being returned."
2,Cheap thin plastic,"Can't say how it works, but don't squeeze it too hard. Mine came broken and when I say thin plastic, I mean brittle. What a joke."
2,Lasko Room Heaters,"I was a little disappointed in the Lasko Heater I last ordered. It wasn't the model I was expecting. The previous order of a Lasko room heater was very satisfying. It had remoted control and an ion generator. This last one had neither of these features. Maybe I made a mistake but the image of the one I order was exactly like the first one so I naturally assumed I would receive the same heater. I don't believe this last one has the BTU output as the first one. I am using it as it does serve my purposes, but, I am absolutely elated with the first one I received. I have never seen a heater of that size put out as much heat as the first one. It actually heats my whole house and I have a 2 story house."
1,bad shipment,sorry guys long customer but this time you guys failed the hole side of the heater fell off
4,"Very Good Heater, Would Buy Again","Live in an 1800s farmhouse, too drafty to heat with just propane as it would cost a fortune. Got this unit for my bedroom. Love the fact that it has a thermostat which controls when it comes on and goes off. Also has a remote which is very useful. Would buy another of this make and model."
3,Delivered wet and box demolished,"Found product left on front porch. Did not ship in an outer carton, just the color box you would see on the shelf. Box was wet and ripped open but did not see any external damage. Worked great the first night (using it in the garage under work bench), seemed to keep a small area under bench warm. However second week in and it warms only items a foot or two in front of it. Not sure if it was actually damaged and it is now showing or if this is the unit itself. Not sure if I would recommend at this time."
3,Nice design,"Heater shape and design is very good. Sits flat against a wall and draws cool air in underneath, while expelling warmed air out via a 90 degree adjustable head. The ceramic heater head is not as large as I expected and the resulting heat output is not as high as I had hoped for. I am in a warmer climate (Savannah) so only trying to raise the ambient temperature a few degrees. I takes several hours to raise the room (about 500 sf) from 60 to 65 degrees. Remote works well and the ionization feature is a nice feature."
5,Nice unit,"I stand this right up next to the wall in our 5th wheel trailer, set the thermo at whatever you like, leave it on, keeps a constant temp., so far it has approx. 2000 hours on it and it is still working perfect."
3,Looks like R2D2 but heats well,"Strengths:Powerful heater, it warms up a room fairly quickly. The heated air can be directed horizontally or vertically with the vent control. This heater would be a good choice in cold climates.Thermostat seems pretty good at keeping the room at a constant temperture.Has auto (thermostat controlled), low, high heating modes. Only the low heating mode is quiet.Cool to touch, can be placed against wall.Remote control works well.Weaknesses:Unit is not as quiet as would be hoped. This may be an issue if you are watching TV or going to sleep with the heater on. In the low heat mode, the fan is fairly quiet, but then the heater will remain constantly on (the automatic mode that controls the heater using the thermostat uses both high and low heat modes). The remote control can help alleviate this problem.Unit is LARGER than most alternatives (be sure to note dimensions). Not as easy to store in summer months.Remote control ""beep"" from the unit is pretty loud."
4,Great !,I want a heater to use when I didn't realy need the furnace. This heater works great. It is very quiet on low and on high you can just bearly hear the fan. The remote work well and the timer is handy to set it to turn off at a later time.I use it in my livingroom which is 14x20. the unit does a very good job of keeping it warm.I would buy it again!
3,Customer service for Mfg not good.,"Beware if you contact the mfg for service. Sit on hold for a long time, does not return calls or emails.I purchased this heater and I liked having a remote control. The heater works great but the remote part does not. I thought it was the remote itself but it wasn't. My brother bought the same heater and I used my remote on his and it worked. Evidently something inside the heater itself does not work with the remote. It is to late to return the device to Amazon and I really don't want to pack up the heater and send it back."
4,Does exactly what it says,"Perfect for a medium size room. Check the dimentions, it is not exactly small but that's what helps with all the heat. I have been very pleased with the heat output and it keeps my living room at the perfect temp. Auto feature works very well. There is also a timer if your planning to leave and want to make sure that it gets turned off.Highly recommend!"
4,Works as promised,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great little heater. The only drawback is the noise that the fan makes. I cannot evaluate the room size this unit will heat as it is getting too warm here in CA to challenge the output of this heater. The advantahe of this heater is the instant heat output ( like a heat lamp) that eliminates any istant chill."
1,Terrible,"I purchased this heater because it seemed to get decent reviews, but was very unhappy with its output of heat. I wanted a heater for my bedroom so I didn't have to turn on my central heat upstairs at night. I have a fairly large bedroom, but not huge, and this heater couldn't warm it at all. I returned it and bought an electric fireplace heater with a small blower, it heats up the room in less than an hour. Perhaps I had a defective unit, but this thing didn't impress me at all. Save your money."
3,Not enough power for our needs,"Upon reading the reviews we decided to purchase this item to heat our living room/dining room combo. Unfortunately, in addition to being a bit bulky and unsightly, it just does not have enough power to cover the space. Other than the size, this would probably work for much smaller spaces. We thought maybe buying another and placing one on either end might be a solution, but have decided to return the item and buy the honeywell 817 instead. it costs a lot more, but apparently has a consumer report best buy that was supported by the boston globe. we will give that a go and perhaps buy this low profile base board model for several rooms, if the first unit works out!"
4,Room Heater a little loud,"I got this unit for my basement approx 14 x 30'. It does keep the basement a nice temperature - set the thermostat - nice! BUT the fan became quite loud. Not bad with the TV on, but is somewaht distracting when it is quiet. Good for the price, however could be designed to operate more quietly."
2,Overpriced and lame engineering,I primarily bought it for the ion feature which kills any smells from the heater and surrounding air.Pros:Works well in small roomsQuick heat from fanSits flush against a wallCons:Quickly lowers the humidity resulting in dry sinus and throat (excessive ozone?)The (cheap) fan is too loud and uneven on high and rumbles on lowThe beep function is too loudNeeds 3 speedsDirectional fan louvers won't adjust low enough to heat body directlyUglyQuestionable ionization feature (harmless type?)Now if someone would make a heater with a harmless ionization feature with radiant heat and a super quiet fan that maxed out at 1250 watts.
1,just so you know to save your money,realize that all electric heaters put out a max of a little more than 5000 btu's per their 1500 watt rating. so do not be fooled into spending more on features to get nothing. it is good to have a thermostat for auto temperature control but beyond that money is wasted on remote controls and the like. up to 50 dollars for a fan forced or oil filled heater with thermostat is the sensible way to go.
1,Turned into a Turkey!,"I had previously bought several of the Lasko tower heaters which worked great until they died. I thought, hey, this one is bigger, ergo better...but, I was WRONG!!! Silly me, I bought THREE of these; two crapped out immediately; one continues to limp along, but I never know when it will have a 'brain' malfunction and turn itself totally off until I unplug and reset it. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE! If you must have a Lasko, get the tower, even if you have to buy two to get enough heat. What a bummer!"
3,Smells a little Weird,"Works great, but smells a little weird. Turning on the ion air cleaner helped, but still smells a little weird."
5,Best. Heater. Ever.,"I just bought this back in December to heat my 'Man Cave'. Its a sizable room above a detached garage and gets really cold, below freezing at times. This heater is a lifesaver out there. Its a little big and a little noisy (though, I've yet to see a ceramic space heater that wasn't a little noisy) but heats like a champ. It can be 30 degrees outside and this will have it a 350 sq ft room up to the 60s in only a few hours. If I know its going to be a super cold night then I'll run it on a timer for a few hours prior to going to bed and turn it on an hour or so before I want to go spend time out there and its warm and comfy. The high settings is great at bringing the temp up and the low is good at quietly maintaining that comfort zone. Just one note, this heater (like most) is 1500 watts on the high setting which is around 12.5 amps meaning if it isn't on a dedicated circuit you won't be able to run much else on the same circuit before you hit the typical 15 amp circuit load."
3,may want a bigger one if possible,bought this to help heat half of my basement during usage times. Does'nt do a great job on this size area but will toast a 12x12 bedroom with regular heat comming in
1,Underachiever,I purchased this heater in hopes of heating a 20 x 10 area in my basement that was just refinished. It does a poor job concentrating the heat only in an area of about 5 X 10 feet in front of the heater. The temperature then drops off sharply. I would not recommend this heater for a large area or an area that is not well insulated.
3,ok,"It's a bit overpriced but heats my small room 12X14 well and quickly. Ionizer is a gimmick and doesnt really work. Not a lot of options to direct the heated air (only vertical) you have to physically turn the unit to go side to side. Remote works will. Thermostat is ughh, ok.....autoshutoff/timer is ok (but questionable)"
3,Does the job,"I bought this for my husband who is an occassional cigar smoker who is banished to the cold patio during the winter. A big outdoor heater was too much for the space and time useage, so this type of heater works perfect. It keeps him warm while he enjoys his cigar and it doesn't take up a big area. He's happy!"
3,""" Almost "" worth the price when it's on sale","For someone who is getting older, breaking in a new phone system can be a challenge. This Panasonic was no exception, but the worst single feature about the phone is that one of the systems the LED Display is garbled so that while you know there is some information about the incoming call, it is impossible to read it.Phone features are fine, reception is very good, but the lack of a blinking light to indicate a new voice mail message is a real pain to get used to"
3,There is a movie!,"oreally asks why no one ever made a movie about this story. Actually there was a made-for-tv-movie produced, in 1978 (also known as ""And I ALone Survived""). Blair Brown stars as Lauren Elder, and Dan Ackroyd plays Jay Fuller (the incomptent pilot). I haven't seen the movie, but presumably it comes around every so often on late night television.Jay's post-accident lethargy and lack of will to live reminded me of the line in the movie ""The Edge"": ""Why do most people die after getting lost? They die of shame"". Here, Jay was so overcome by his piloting screw-up (and subsequent death of his girlfriend, Jean) that he seems to essentially have decided that live wasn't worth living any more.oreally also asks what became of Lauren Elder. As far as I can find out on the Internet, she still lives in the San Fransisco area, where she makes her living as a set designer for local plays."
3,I wanted a tight spot to place my drink when driving my Jeep ...,"I wanted a tight spot to place my drink when driving my Jeep and bought this drink cup holder, but this is so wide that when you place any type of regular plastic bottle over it it just moves or floats around it, I think they should change the mold and make it more straight rather than stepped as it is now."
3,ZIPPO 200ZP Cigarette Lighter,Pros: its a zippo lighterCons: the rubber grips got loose after a couple of weeks its gotten so annoying i'm considering buying a new lighterother than that its what you'd expect of a zippo it works even in high wind
5,Who needs ecstacy when songs are this good!!!!!,For anyone who loves progressive trance pieces with strong vocals from the likes of paul van dyk and tiesto this song is as good as it gets. The Rising stars mix is absolutely amazing raising the bar for DJs everywhere with one of the most euphoric climaxes you will ever hear.
2,"Wimpy, Thin - Is this Therion?","By far the worst Therion album in my collection. It's like they ran out of funding and had to record this album in someone's basement with no multitracks nor chorales. Where's the amazing orchestration? The layered vocals? Ugh, this is just a ""run-of-the-mill"" pop-rock album. You may as well go buy from masters of that genre like AC/DC or Metallica (fine bands, but by no means Therion). No evidence that this is at all like their previous offerings based on Symphonic Metal - just a basic, pedestrian pop-rock meh. As I said, other bands pull off the Pop-Metal genre far better than this attempt by Therion. Hopefully they will return to being the Symphonic Metal powerhouse they used to be (a la: Deggial, Lemuria, Secret of the Runes, Sirius B, Theli, Vovin - GK simply does NOT fit in with those works)."
2,Tremendously disappointing,"This album is mostly glam-rock style vocals and sort of wimpy music. It's a total disappointment, compared to Sirius B and Lemuria. I don't recommend this album for anyone other than diehard Therion fans."
5,My top album of 07,"Another moment in history has arrived. Heads up! It's Gothic KabbalahThe new album from Therion brakes down more musical barrios. This band like to try out new things all the time, and they do so here without looking back. We have here a spectacular double album. From start to end, there is no time to get bored More great track after another. A lot of the tracks are memorable, but unfortunately, dew ti the inherent weirdness of Therion's song titles they are harder to recall. A couple of stand out tracks are, Son of the staves of time, and the falling stone. But you can't go wrong with the entire album really."
3,It a little different for them,It sounds like a slight departure from the Lemuria sound that I love. Feels a little less opera and a little more Lacuna Coil.
3,"Ok, not quite the same","This album is, in my opinion, not as good as previous. There are many good songs and the other good Therion stuff, but some of the vocals are a bit off- making me think that it is a leftover 80's rock band instead of what I am used to from Therion from albums like Vovin or Theli. I know they've evolved a lot since the beginning, but I don't see this last album as being better. Maybe a half step backwards, but still a BUY for any serious Therion fan."
3,packaging terrible,"This product arrived in a black bag from the postoffice. White vitamin C crytals leaking out, gave the postoffice a scare. The lid was broken and leaking. lost about half of the product, would not order from them again."
5,Incredible Music,"It's not often that I like every cut (or should I say burn) on a CD.Gabrielle is just outstanding on each song, the musicians with her and the arrangements are world class.If you jazz at all, you'll love and appreciate this CD.Great to add to your collection."
1,"too thick, too long to dry","It's shiny, yeah, but it's like clear coat for a car and probably takes as long to dry (24hours?). I finished my pedicure and manicure literally four hours ago and my toe nails are getting imprints in them from fabric, etc. I just bought this bottle, it's brand new, so I know that it's not because it's old. I also know that it shouldn't take four hours for my nails to dry! Also, it seems to have encouraged bubbles in the nail polish on my finger nails, which usually happens when layers of polish accumulate without enough time to dry. I always let them air out a few minutes between coats, and this usually doesn't happen, so again the blame goes to the top coat. Save your money!"
1,Doesn't work!!,"I should have read the reviews first. I used this product as a top coat. It never really fully dried, and it seemed to almost emusify the polish underneath. On top of that, it gets tiny, wart-like bubbles. I re-did the whole process, thinking I'd done something wrong. I used good polish and a good base coat and made sure each layer was dry. Again, the same thing happened when I applied this as a top coat: emulsified nail polish and tiny bubbles. Hours later, it was still a sloppy mess. For a product that cost $9.00 a bottle at a local store, I'm extremely disappointed and will be returning promptly. Could this be a bad batch? I don't know, but please don't waste your money. Try something else!"
4,Yummy and economical.,The only problem I have with this product is the packaging. The zip lock doesn't work well. It rips the majority of the time when you open the package. Otherwise the raisins are wonderful and the price is great. I found this to be the most economical package size. D
2,Average Raisins.,"I have been eating giant raisins that are bursting with flavor. I was surprised at the average size of these raisins. They're OK, but just not as good as the jumbo raisins I get locally."
5,Newman's Own Organic Raisins,I've ordered these twice now and am impressed with the freshness. Real good raisins...will order again.
5,Plump Perfection,"These raisins are plump, moist, not dry at all. I have tried other organic brands and these have been the best I have had so far."
5,Great deal for great raisins,"I've been very happy with Newman's Own so far. I like how the big package is sealed very nicely and the raisins stay nice, fresh, and moist.You won't be able to stop munching on these, my wife had to hide them from me, because I was eating too many."
4,Pleasently surprised,"unfortunately, i haven't much time to write an in-depth review of this album. however, i thought it was a shame that it hadn't been review yet. i had no idea who this artist was until i ventured over to the ""secretly canadian"" website and listened to one of the samples from there. i purchased the album the next day. this is a great double-album that i have basically been listening to non-stop for the past week. a fantastic lo-fi album with an accessible, warm 70's vibe throughout. recomended to any fan of the singer/sonwriter genre. RIYL: cody chesnutt, m. ward, sufjan stevens, dennison witmer, iron & wine, bonnie ""prince"" billy. warning: this album cause daydreaming/nostalgia."
1,bailie gymnastics grips,when i ordered these grips for my daughter i thought that they looked pink so that was why we got them when they came they turned out to be grey and the finger holes were much to small i tried them at gymnastics and they ended up making her fingers bleed so i ended up just buying another pair of grips where we could try them on and they turned out to be much better so unless your looking for faliure grips i suggest you don't buy these
3,The sizing is off,"These grips run very small. I measured my hands per the measurement directions (they are 6 3/4"") and ordered the sized 2 which is supposed to fit 6.5-7.25. These grips were a good bit too small. My coach told me that a lot of her girls have been having this issue with Bailie grips. I plan on ordering the size 3, so I will update this review at some point."
2,Disappointing...,"I was excited about this book, and was looking forward to learning about the life of one of the greatest scientists of all time. Unfortunately though I was really disappointed. A good biography has the ability to make you feel like you knew the person, and have some insights about their life. I didn't feel that way at all after reading this book. It certainly covers the basics, and gave an accurate timeline. But, it does not have the personal anecdotes, and first-person accounts that are really engaging. I felt like I learned more about Fermi as a person from Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" than I did from this book."
1,bad!,this device made my phone reboot everytime i plugged it in. DONT BUY!spend more money on another charger.my phone was samsung A707.
4,Not so bad,"This started out as one of those purchases I knew I shouldn't make. I paid pennies for the charger and $5 for shipping. I knew it would work once and never again, but that wasn't the case. So far its going o.k. I'll update if something changes."
3,It wasn't what I'd expected,"The first time I heard the CD I was a little overwhelmed, I had received it as a gift. At first all the songs sounded similar to one another other. But, by the next time I heard it I could pick out the songs I liked and disliked. It wasn't what I'd expected, but it wasn't bad."
1,i thought i 'd try this,some one recommended this. i could not even get through the whole cd ..it is awful
5,One of my favorite CDs!,"This is such a great CD. Yeah there are only five songs on it, but they're all awesome! Especially Halloween - it gets me so pumped up. These are my favorite versions of all of these five songs. Definitley the best version of Watchtower. And this version of Halloween has better lyrics than the one on BTCS. Not a bad note on the CD - every song is fabulous! My friend borrowed mine and won't give it back. I miss it! Anyway, it's an awesome CD, buy it now!"
5,Awe stricken,"I have an idea...let's put 5 songs on disc and sell thousands. DMB did it. This band is the cream of the crop. A band with a lead man whose talent is so raw that he does not know what a time signature is until five years after his first composition. People, that is music straight from the heart! One cover but that is ok. I am very impressed!"
5,Excellent,"What else can I say? I love the versions of all 5 songs on this release. It is obvious that even back in the early 90's these guys were phenomenal. Live performances are the only way to capture the essence of this talented group of musicians. I highly reccomend ""Recently"" to anyone who enjoys the band's live material over studio material.Peace"
4,good but not completely worth the price,"This is a GOOD cd but for 5 songs 10 bucks is too much,maybe 5 bucks, nut anyway most of the songs are good except recently (you can find a better version on remember 2 things) and warehouse its just dumb but watchtower is amazing and halloween is the best get this if your a fan or want a little taste of matthews"
4,Tortoise 'Millions Now Living Will Never Die' (Thrill Jockey),"Originally released in 1996, as this was the experimental jazz-rock five piece's second CD. Pretty much as good as it's follow-up 'TNT'. The opener, twenty-one minute epic ""Djed"" is the best track this disc has to offer - hands down. Couple other notable cuts I was sort of impressed with were ""Glass Museum"" and ""Along The Banks Of The River"". Should appeal to fans of Sea And Cake, Cul De Sac, Trans Am, Isotope 217 and maybe Soft Machine."
3,"Not bad, not great either.","The song glass museum is my favorite song on here...it has a nice, relaxing, and beautiful overall sound to it-very nice guitar rifts on it. The first song DJed is an instrumental medley. The first part of the medley with the heavy bass and the shaking sound I like quite a bit and maybe another part of the medley. The last song on the album is an ok song too. But thumbs down for the other three tracks. I find that on too many tortoise songs it will have a sound you start to like or enjoy and its quickly destroyed with another sound coming out of nowhere that is just lousy and does not blend at all with the previous sound. It's almost as if the band members all have their own agendas of how the song shall be played and are not in agreement or in unison of how it shall be played."
3,"Interesting, but not essential","The way some people write about these guys, you would think they're the second coming of Neu! or the reincarnation of Kraftwerk. Well, I wish they were. I want to like this CD a lot more than I do, but I've had it for a few months and not played it more than a couple of times. The music is just too static. Even with Neu! or Kraftwerk, who these guys obviously show a debt to, the music evolves and there are little details that jump out at you on repeated listenings. On this CD, though, what you hear is pretty much what you get. It seems a lot more detailed and intricate than it really is. There are some appealing things on here and some good ideas, but they are not explored in enough depth to make this a really essential recording. It does make good background music, but if I wanted good background music, I have Eno's ambient recordings for that. Overall I found it disappointing after all the hype I had heard about this band."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Just listened to this CD on a road trip and gotta say it's pretty dull, nothing really grabbed me about it and the idea that ""Djed"" is a life-changing track is laughable. Tedious, yes, life-changing, no. This isn't to say Tortoise is a bad band - their debut CD is actually pretty decent, as is TNT. But it's best to skip this one. Have never understood why it's so highly praised as one of their best ..."
2,Robotooz,"Item did not work when arrived. Since it was over 30 days by the time I got back into the country, the store would not exchange. Forget Robotoolz and attempting to contact them, impossible! Finally prevailed on the seller and they exchanged it for me."
1,a very unreliable tool,"this tool BARELEY works ,it does not work in freezing weather, the batteries must be removed or they die in a month, reguardless of temp. even with fresh batts it's unreliable and shuts off by it self or gives error code.i use it for measuring siding footage and building hts for staging,because thats all it's good for. i'm a pro contractor and tool nut ,and would have retured it had i not bought it at a trade show."
5,Well written story that keeps you interested.....,"The Honey Well was a novel that I enjoyed from beginning to end, and while some reviewers did not enjoy this story, (it is somewhat along the current negative books you read these days), because it is so well written it keeps you captivated. You feel for Arnell, but wonder why she keeps letting her mother, Esther, completely dominiate and humiliate her.Esther, the mother is a complex characther...classy yet vulgar, sweet yet sinister, you are captivated as to why and how she became the woman she is. Unfortunately the ending is a bit dull and the explanation of how Esther's deciving ways came to be is never really explained completely. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book and will try to find more by this author."
4,Great read!,"I purchased this book used and it appeared to be in pristine condition. The book was riviting and scary. Very insightful, disgusting and funny at times."
5,what kind of mother are you???????,"I didn't know what to expect at first when I began reading this book, but boy was it a page turner!!!! Like all the other reviews, this one had me hooked and disgusted all at the same time from page one! Esther was in a word, a TRIP!! Prostituting her own daughter then claiming she loved her and was only trying to make a good life for her???? She was truly twisted!My heart went out to Arnell because she was really confused and didn't know how to break away from her mother's clutches.The ending was great, though! Arnell was able to redeem herself and get her life back on track. Esther???? You'll have to read it... Ms. Mallette, any chance for a sequel????"
3,A face only a daughter could love....somehow!,"Actually, 2.5 stars. Do NOT read this review if you haven't read the book!!OKay, there is one in every crowd, and I am the one in here. I was not all that crazy about the book. The writing was unedited: the phrase is ""used to"", not ""use to"". The characters need a little help developing. Jeanette is weak as a character. Trena has an ending hard to figure out. And how could Arnell continue to tolerate the hell Esther visited on her, way past maturity? Trena so easily leaves a good (I didn't say perfect) mother while Arnell lets her evil mother destroy her life. It boggles the mind. As usual, most of the men are dogs. Even Tony. Only Ace really shines.Some of the dialogue is good, cutting right through honesty, and so enjoyable to read. The ripping dialogue makes up for a weak plot.Only 20% will like my review. But I am not saying don't get the book."
2,Not All That Impressive,"I was really turned off by the author's book, ""Shades of Jade,"" because it was written so poorly -- so elementary. I decided that I didn't want to read any other books by her. The media turned the notch up on this book and so did the reviewers. I don't agree with any of them. As a biased reader, I have nothing to lose by telling the truth. This book wasn't all that. It was a story that is as old as the profession itself. It really wasn't told that much differently than the Billie Holiday story. Don't believe all the hype on this one! A 2.5 stars if that."
1,Dumb.,"What would happen if your mother forced you to prostitute yourself to the landlord to pay the rent? What happens when your mother starts running the hottest brothel in the city? What happens when you mother turns around and sleeps with your fiancee who doesn't know you prostitute? What happens when you find out that your mother biggest customer your fiancee's father? Well, I summed up the whole book for you. If you just feel, after reading my review that you want to read it anyway, get it from the public library. Maybe I am just not a Mallette fan, but when you are in several book clubs and have to read others selections, this is the type of garbage that you read. Skip it if you have a choice."
3,"She ain't a MOTHER, she's a PIMP!","The Honey Well is a scandalous story about a mother who pimps her own daughter. Needless to say her Mother basically runs a whore house for her own selfish needs. Most def. some demented stuff going on. Good read, easy to follow, just as book is described on the back. Get ready to be angry! Take a chance you might like it!"
4,What a mother!!!,"Poor Arnell didn't have a chance from birth, with a scandalous mother like Esther who would do anything for her ownself. Who would? When first asked to do the unthinkable, at age sixteen, Arnell should of ran away from home. She would have been better off. The ending did not far well with me though. I wanted to know more about why Esther turned out the way she was. I know good and well it wasn't only because of a predator uncle. There had to be a lot more to it. But I doubt if we'll ever see a sequal for this. That's not Gloria Mallete's style."
5,Great Story Line,This book was awesome. I could not believe how dysfunctional this mother and daughter relationship was. Great Read You wont be able to put it down.
5,Love!,"I love Richard Scarry. Much of my childhood I can remember spending hours on my belly on the floor pouring over some adventure or another with Richard Scarry's characters. MY favorite was the Big Book of things to do on a Rainy Day, although I'm not sure of the exact title. (We even had a German Richard Scarry from my brother's childhood - during my father's military career!)This book is awesome. Seasonal things and vocabulary make this a great education and entertainment resource. I am delighted to have this for my daughter's very own first Richard Scarry, but it definitely will not be her last."
3,just okay,"Not the classic Richard Scarry format, but still brings our favorite characters back for more. Some repeated content from other books. I assume this was compiled by his estate - really wish we could get new copies of some of the classics."
5,Pure enjoyment!,"There are, in each of Kristine O'Connell George's books, moments that make you gasp with the depth of insight she's put into words. ""Toasting Marshmallows"" is no different in that respect and is a joy to read. George has captured the sights, sounds -- and silences that are part of camping. With humor and joy, the camping experience -- from setting up the tent to listening to an owl --is illuminated and enhanced by the words in this delightful book of poems. A treasure for the summer -- and all year round!"
5,Makes me want to go camping right now!,"Writing that pulls you in....illustrations to make you feel like you are there. This is one of my favorite poetry books! Perfect to read with your children before a camping trip, or under their bedcovers with a flashlight. A perfect book to use during a camping theme for a birthday party or home learning or in a classroom. From nature to tent talk to camping equipment, this book uses glorious words and vivid pictures to take your brain camping."
3,Toasting Marshmallows,This collection of poems has great ideas for a camping theme. The poems themselves serve as inspiration for writing my own poems on the same topics.
2,Just none's opinion,"This video is NOT an instructional video, if you have any fly fishing experience. A lot of catching, high 5's, thank you's and attaboy's, but very, very short on instruction. As far as flies, 2 are used, both are basically white zonkers, 1 has a blade.A disappointing waste of 45 minutes"
5,Everything A DMB fan wants and more...,"After thinking and listening, I conclude that this is THE essential DMB cd. First off, it sounds wonderful - I'm talking about quality of songs and cd. Everything is remarkably played; it certainly showcases DMB amazing abilities the best. Also, in my opinion, the choice of songs is awesome. Good choices on DMB's part. I love every song on it. GREAT CD for new and old fans."
5,Live at Red Rocks,"I have been a fan for years and must say this is their best collection of songs released to date. The songs seem endless as you actually feel part of the live audience. Each song sounds better than the studio release as Dave, Carter, Boyd, Stefan and Leroi pour their emotions into every tune. Lound speakers and good company recommended. A must buy for any real fan."
1,I love the 60s too - let's take the time machine,"Or better yet, let's just take the car to get the Dave Matthews Band Live at Red Rocks. Who needs to actually time travel when you can musically travel back in time with just one album? When I look at the calendar while listening to this album, all I can see is 1966. Oh yes, let's avoid the 21st Century as long as we can. Maybe if we listen to this album repeatedly, the future will pass us by and we can drive around in our Microbus to our heart's content.DMB sound like the inept inbred child of Kathie Lee Gifford and Regis Philben let loose in an orchestra pit at a Jimmy Buffet concert. Put shortly, it sounds like a bad reading of 60s jam band culture futilely snazzed up for a 90s audience. If you have to listen to music like this, at least listen to a band who do it right, i.e. Allman Brothers, the Dead, Phish, or Moe."
5,DAVE MATTHEWS IS WONDERFUL,Every time I hear his voice I am totally captivated by his wonderful lyrics and extremely soothing voice. The whole band is a well constructed music machine prepared to give us all the show of our lives. Dave and his crew are a must see in person try and catch them while they are on tour!
4,DMB LIVE INSPIRING,"This is a very good cd. Carter Buford (drummer) reminds me of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham by the little things he does. He's not just keeping time. As with all of the DMB material released, Carter is the unsung hero. For any drummer looking for inspiration, pay attention to Carter!"
3,Seen better..,I have all DMB CDs and quite a few of their bootlegs. This CD is ok but there are a lot of good songs not on it. The concert was fine but I've seen and heard better.
3,What Were They Thinking?,"I like the Dave Matthews Band and own their studio albums. They have a unique sound, which blends World Rock, Jazz and Folk. In concert they are the best jam group I've seen since Santana in the early 70's. I also like live discs and own plenty of them. Thirty years ago when your bought a concert album, you'd hear the crowd mixed in with the music. After repeated listening, it honestly got old. In the last twenty years, progress was made where you hear just the music once the song starts. ""Live At The Red Rocks"" must have been a rush job by the record company to counter tapers and bootlegers. The Dave Matthews Band plays excellent on this cd, but audience noise should have been left out. Roaring crowds should be best left for those rocking sports (various artists) type compilations. You can put this one in the ""Live Throw Away"" catagory."
2,Not the best of what's around,"One must realize that while reviewing, I am putting this cd on par with the other DMB live albums. I will come out and say it, this album is simply not the best. I base this on the sole reason that all live albums should be based upon: 1)this album does not defer so much from the regular studio albums, 2) the basic sound quality is not fantastic, and 3) the two other live albums blow this one in the wind. So, if you are thinking of purchasing a live DMB album, get either the soothing Luther College, or the fantastic Listener Support. If you have both of those . . . well, I'm such a DMB fan that I have to say get this one too."
5,DMB Rocks!!!,dave matthews band has done it again. this 5 peice band creates such an incredibly lush and full sound on each song that the album is almost impossible to grow tired of. The best live album I've ever heard. Buy it!
5,"A new album, and 10 minutes to spare","I almost forgot to buy this album. Really, I did. I knew it was being released and forgot to go get it until 30 minutes before class the day it came out. But, I have to say, those 30 minutes were some of the most musically charged minutes in my life. I managed to listen to maybe 2 songs in that time, and those minutes will stay with me forever. The power of live music is not something to be missed by anyone, but something gets added to the experience when you are also running at fever pitch like the performers. I recommend throwing this album in the CD player about 10 minutes before you have to walk out the door. Then, even if you have never been at a DMB show, you can feel like you have."
4,good album,"If you like Dave Matthews buy his live stuff. All of his live stuff is better than in the studio. It doesn't matter which one you get but my personal favorite is the Central Park Concert. This one is good too though, but not his best."
5,"so raw, so pure, so great","From the opening notes of seek up to dave introducing tim reynolds at the end of watchtower this album is just mind-blowing. A must have for any starting fan or die hard fan as well. This album contains the songs and sounds that dmb fans love. Highlights of this album include seek up, two step, lie in our graves, dancing nancies (which contains in my opinion one of their all-time best jams and probably the best on album), tripping billies, the drum solo in #36, the fans singing on ants marching and of course watchtower. The only song that is not as good as the others is proudest monkey but believe me it is still good. One more comment--Tim Reynolds plays electric guitar throughout the entire album and he sounds terrific. Definitely dmb's best album."
5,all time great- matters what kind of fan you are,"Live at Red Rocks is probably the best live album of this generation. I don't hesitate recommending this album to anyone, and this review is probably overkill as i notice all the other 5 stars. But let be say this, if you are considering which live album to buy: rocks or listener, heres a clue. if your a UTTAD fan, like their early work, and extended jams this cd is for you. BTCS fans go to listener."
5,Excellent piece of equipment.,"I record (and sometimes perform) ambient/electronic music. Electric guitar, no synthesizers. I was searching for a reverb unit, but most effects boxes for reverb are limited and expensive. For the price, this thing is amazing. Many different reverb and delay settings as well as built in modulation effects. Easy to use, easy to program and durable."
1,Do NOT order from UniqueSquared...,"Ordered this processor and tried it out. Many of the effects were great, but I needed more adjustability for tremolo and so decided to go a different route and return the unit.Most items purchased on Amazon.com can be returned for a full refund, including shipping. UniqueSquared will charge you shipping and a substantial restocking fee-- read the fine-print before you order with them.Buyer beware."
3,Connection to Directv problems,"This is a feature packed unit at a very reasonable price. My problem is the connections for input do not blend with the Directv HDTV receiver. The receiver does not have a coaxial output althought it does have component output. The Philips has coax input, but not component input. So, back it goes. Very disappointed."
2,Check with your cable provider first!,"There is a pretty glaring error with this product that makes it nearly useless for a lot of people: it doesn't work with some cable providers. I have cable from Charter Communications. My TV has to stay on channel 4, while I control the cable channels through the cable box. But the Philips DVD Recorder doesn't know about the cable channels; it only knows about channel 4 on the TV. That means you can't use the VCR codes to schedule recordings. You also can't record something if you're not already watching it. The whole purpose of the DVD Recorder is negated.The one positive I can offer is that Electronics Expo didn't give me any hassle in returning it, so I only ended up having to pay for the shipping."
2,Much less than desired,"You can't copy DVDs to the harddrive. There is no ""Menu"" button on the remote to go directly to DVD menus when playing. There is no TV guide listings as another poster has wrongfully posted. You can supply VCR+ input codes to record TV programs, but they are always off by 1 hour, and I don't receive any publications which have VCR+ codes so I have to get online to retrieve them. All menus for this hardware and channel changing is sluggish with annoying delays. I am returning this product."
1,Philips DVDR3455H - Junk,"I bought this DVR a couple years ago.It has been problematic the whole time.It takes forever for the unit to come on. You turn it on and then watch the pretty ""Philips"" screen for 15 - 30 seconds before it finally comes up and is usable.The unit I have frequently quits responding to the remote and will not turn off. I finally plugged it into a switched outlet so I could turn it off (count to 5) and then back on.The DVD player/recorder tray wouldn't always open so I could get the DVD out and finally it just quite working all together. It wouldn't play or record a DVD.Today the power went out and the stupid thing just reboots over and over. I think maybe the hard drive has completely failed.Other than all of that - it had a good picture and was relatively easy to learn how to use.I'm not going to replace this unit with another Philips DVR. I'm going to look for something more reliable that works reliably."
5,My Very First Devotional Bible,"Excellent, Excellent Book!!! I've bought a copy for my son, nephew and God-daughter. It's an excellent book for beginning the Christian education process with a child. The real world stories helps your child make the connection with the Scriptures and how they should be used for direction in our lives. The colorful illustrations are excellent also."
4,"Excellent, practical guide",I purchased this book because I am supervising clinical trials in both Europe and the US. I found it to be a concise but athouritative guide on how to run my studies in Europe. It lays things out in a step by step manner with appropriate references where needed. This is particularly helpful because there are some significant differences in the EU verses FDA requirements. It has been of particular help to me when I've needed to educate recalcitrant investigators who have balked at GCP requirements and the volumes of paperwork required. I would recommend it for the novice as well as the expert clinical research manager. I would also recommend purchasing a copy for each of the research sites used to facillitate communications between sponsor and investigator.
4,Pure Sandy Nelson,"This disk is classic old fashioned R&R. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I remember to original 45RPM record of ""Teen Beat,"" and what they present isn't quite it. There was a bit more to it, as I recall, and I do wish they had left it in. Still in all, it's note a bad CD. If you're into classic R&R, you'll like this offering."
5,A small treasure.,"The tracks on this cd were recorded live from a radio station in New York city. The first time I listened to this cd I was a bit disapointed by the sound quality, but not for long. After 2 or 3 listenings, I was under the charm. This cd was the real starting point for my appreciation for latin music (especially salsa and son montuno). It's hard to believe that there can be great live music like this on the radio! The music on this cd is impeccable, warm and rich."
2,Pretty bad...especially for John Ford.,"Suppose he gets a Mulligan for this one though.I usually have a strong precognition about Westerns I've never seen or heard about-that's cause they generally [are not good]. And this one didn't disappoint. Semi-light ""buddy"" formula with occasional serious overtones, or in this case undertones. I don't know what to say, I'm speechless. Just a really bad movie. Only Gregory Peck's ""Shoot Out"" comes close to it's pure awfulnissity. Oh yeah, Woody Strode as a Commanche....right. And Richard Widmark's character takes the cake as a 45 yr. old West Point grad that is STILL a Lieutenant in the Cavalry. Apparently a symbolic demotion for accepting a role in a movie with such a pitiful script. Jimmy Stewart as a deranged bi-polar mercenary is the capper. You've been warned."
4,Fun for any western genre fan.,So its not oscar winning material! This movie is great for watching a trio of old Hollywood pros having a good time. Jimmy Stewart plays against type as a down and out lawman who finds a reason to change. Richard Widmark (my all time favorite actor) is great as usual as a soldier who lives his values and John Ford directs the cast with style. Enjoy!
3,Any Ford is better than no Ford...,"This is not a great movie.It's sort of a smattering of great scenes from various Ford films of the past. On its own, however, it just doesn't quite hold together. I don't think Ford was very interested in making this movie, and it shows. But still you have those flashes of brilliance that shine forth in even the worst Ford movie.[Watch for the scene with Stewart and Widmark sitting on the river banks). Still I wouldn't regard this as evidence of the great man's decline, because the next year he bounced back with ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."" Ford at his worst was still a lot better than many other directors at their best!"
4,Trek,"This is a must-have for any true trekker in the universe. The authors, although slanted towards TOS and DS9, do a good job of reviewing every Star Trek episode (including animated)through 1997. I felt Altman's criticism overly harsh at times, but for the most part the duo sticks behind Star Trek and delivers a gem."
4,Interesting but usually Silly,"Altman & Gross's reviews are always interesting, but it's pretty clear to me that as far as The Original Series was concerned, they're both pretty blind. None of them mention that Shatner is an excruciatingly bad actor, and they always seem to find a glimmer of something Magnificent in even the lousiest original series episode. I think Altman & Gross should be called Kirk worshippers rather than critics. (Ever notice how much they LOVE IT whenever the original series is mentioned in any current series dialogue?)"
1,One Trek hater and one parrot,"These people do not love Star Trek. They just like the first two seasons of the original series. Especially Altman is the kind of critic Woody Allen had in mind in his descend to Hell. He diminishes some of the best Trek episodes, particularly in New Generation and Voyager, trying at the same time to make himself ""look"" good by using words like ""adroitness"", or inventing ones like ""technobabble"". What a load of CRAP! Gross reads Altman's review FIRST and then he adds a star in his rating. Altman really has a personality problem. If you love star trek, it's better to rate it yourself. The only value of the book is in some trivia regarding the episodes."
5,An Adorable Book for Your Adorable Baby,"My seven month old daughter gives this book her full attention. She giggles and smiles every time I read it to her. It kept her interest for five consecutive readings! As for the poem and unique illustrations, they are contagious! I think parents will enjoy the book just as much as baby."
1,This had better be a damn good book for $300?,who in their right mind pays $300 for a board book? WTF? I must be losing my mind because it is $300....is it just me?
4,ipod photo is an old item,This did fit the need I had. The bad news is with Apple: they don't support their old items. Oh well.
2,WHY?,"Alright, here's the deal. I've never really liked Dave Matthews. I like about two songs. That's it. Sampling this didn't help draw me in any more, that's for sure. It's not any worse than his other stuff though.However, I just needed to say this: What in the bloody heck were they THINKING with that album cover? I mean, honestly, album covers are supposed to help entice people to buy the album. If I were on the fence about the album, seeing that cover would put me in the ""don't buy"" state of mind. Obviously diehards are going to buy the album no matter what, but I guess DMB doesn't give a crap about bringing anyone else in if they're going to put out something with that poor of an album cover. Honestly. That's the whole point in the graphic design business--to appeal to the eye and make people want whatever the subject is. COMMON SENSE, jeez.K. I'm done with my rant."
5,Brilliant,"Dave could be the next Sting of modern music. Original, raw, melodic, and a ton of feel. This could be one of rocks all time greatest cd's."
4,His first album; a stroke of genius,"Dave and his crew before the influence of being on a major label set in. A mastefully written, upbeat album. Hardcore Dave fans will get the most enjoyment out of this one, but for the more mainstream fans, favorites from ""Under the Table"" and ""Crash"" such as ""Ants Marching"", ""Satellite"", and ""Tripping Billies"" are live on this album."
2,Eh,A lot of the same songs from their later albums. It sounds more like the rough draft version of those songs those. Only a couple songs I hadn't heard before and they aren't that good. I would not recommend this CD.
5,Exactly What I Expected,"CD was received in good time, and in great condition. It is just what I wanted. I am completely satisfied."
3,"Still good, but definitely their weakest.","There are still some cool songs on here, but better versions of most of the live songs are avaliable on DMB's later albums."
3,Not bad but not one of the greatest,"It's very interesting to listen to this CD and hear how the band sounded early in their career. While still a great album by a great band, it's not nearly as good as their later efforts. The band's playing early on did not gel together the way it does now, as can be expected from a band who had only been playing together for a short while. Leroi and Boyd sound very mechanical on the sax and violin, respectively, like they know the music perfectly and demonstrate their talent but don't put the emotion into it. All in all, it sounds very tentative. Still, it's a very good CD, just not their best. They've come along way since those days. By the way, the studio version of ""Minarets"" is by far the best track on here. It's just... one of the most amazing songs by the band ever. Steps above everything else."
4,Just Bought This CD...,"I just bought this CD, although I am a big DMB fan. I've been contemplating buying it for awhile, but was hesitant because I thought it was the same old songs on a different CD. I was so wrong! It's got hand-to-find tracks like 'One Sweet World,' and a big fave of mine, 'Christmas Song.' Some of the songs, however, sound a bit different, like the nearly two-minute intro to 'Ants Marching,' but none of the differences detract from the quality of the CD itself. Enjoy!"
4,No one Jams like DMB Jams,"This is a great CD - full of early DMB stuff. For me, the real jewel is track 9, Seek Up. This is a song I can (and usually do) listen to on repeat. The band jams long and hard -- but not to the extent that the music ever gets abstruse or obnoxious. Definitely worth the investment."
5,incredible,This dave cd is the true roots and soul of dmb. Any true dmb fan should own this masterpeice. Just listen to i'll back you up and youll know why every fan of theirs is so devoted. They are undoubtedly the true reighning kings of music.
5,Remember Two Things,"This is a great live recording from a young Dave Matthews Band. If you're a fan of the group, get this CD to see where they came from and how far they've come. Even though this is an early recording from the band, it is still an awesome CD. Even in the early days of the band, it is obvious that they are one of the most musically talented bands out there today."
5,"At the time, a breath of fresh air","I purchased this album in the summer of '94 after seeing a HORDE appearance and before his first major label debut came out. I was absolutely blown away. This was at a time when grunge was still hanging on and guitar jam bands were coming out of the woodwork (not to mention, the DEAD were still around and well). I made everyone I know listen to this album. It was fresh and tuneful and filled with complex, groovy songs. I still find this to be my favorite of all his work thus far, but he still has a way to go. Keep it coming, dude."
5,This is the best dave album,"In my humble opinion this album encompasses everything that makes dave matthews band what they are. It shows their live power and their outstanding musical talent. From Ants Marching to I'll Back You Up, to the rainstorm hidden after Christmas Song ends you cannot go wrong with this album. Don't forget to listen to the Song Jane Likes either!!!"
2,Not the best,"The book is not ALL bad. I haven't gone all the way through yet, and I hope I'm actually learning something. The CD, however, is another story. It comes with a sample copy of Oracle, and it would not install. It exited without telling me anything. Luckily, I had another copy I got from Oracle (you can download it for free from the Oracle web site). I was also looking forward to the flashcard application for my Palm. But the CD menu listed a different filename for the database file than what was on the CD, and when I installed the flashcard application, it crashed my Palm. My emails to Sybex have gone unanswered, and there is no errata on their website. The copy of Oracle that I have (8i, which is supposedly the same as the book references) does not match some of the sample screens and exercises. With a little exploration, I can figure most of it out, though. Bottom line: the book will probably help with your certification, but do NOT let it be your only study guide."
1,OCP: Oracle8i DBO Study Guide,"I used this book to study for the exam. It was helpful when it came to installing Oracle, other than that, the book was hard to follow because there were so many errors.Some of the screen shots from the exercises were incorrect.I would suggest learning SQL, this book does not cover this subject adequately enough for you to pass the test; 16 of my test questions were related to SQL.Overall, this is not a very good book, I'm surprised Sybex let this one leave the editing room!If there was a 0 star rating, I would have used it."
3,"Not the best, but enough","I passed iDBO exam using this book and Oracle DBO (not iDBO) study guide. Some experience with SQL queries is required. And also I did all examples and played a lot with Oracle for NT.That book does not have deep coverage of Oracle architecture (DBO study guide do it better), Backup and recovery (you have to play with it a lot) and SQL/DDL/DML (I migrated my SQL Server database to Oracle and tested it)."
2,Would not recommend,"Nice text for overall introduction to oracle tool set wizards - i.e. 8i install, Database configuration assistant and Oracle WebDB but will not help you pass test alone.Use of the english language was confusing and terms like 'privileges' were replaced with 'rights' which was ambiguous as to how they were assigned. Author even seems to have not grasped the difference between SQL and PL/SQL and used each term in the others context which does surprise me as he is an OCP."
5,Great Book,I really loved this book. Not only does it help with the testbut it helps with day to day administration ! A must have !
3,Pity about the typesetting,"A good book, but not professionally typeset,which is a pity given that TeX has been aroundfor so long.Good content, but not as perceptive as someother books."
2,Clunky - Panasonic DMRES15 far superior,"I bought one of these and returned it in one week. The remote has to be aimed directly at the machine to the point of being a pain. The machine takes about 2 seconds to respond to most commands adding to the frustration and has a generally cheap feel and sound. Overall reception and video quality are OK, not great. And what made me return this unit was when I read reviews about how often they break down. I exchanged it for a Panasonic DMRES15, which cost less money, and within the first 10 minutes it was obviously a far superior machine. Overall operation was smoother and quieter and the remote is fantastic! The Panasonic will also handle DVD-RAM and came with a blank disc! Philips does not."
3,It's okay so far.,"I did not know what to expect in a DVD Recorder. It took me awhile to learn it, but I'm pleased with it so far."
2,Erratic performance - unreliable.,"The recorder will record for 2 or 3 hours and at any time stop and give an error msg. Often the recording works fine but when you finalize you get an error. I have tried +R 8x, -R 4X and +R 4X. Some of these black DVD's were the $2.00 last forever variety. When it works it works well but I cannot live with this erractic behavior. I also think the remote is ridiculous with its small buttons and slow response. I plan to return this item."
2,Clunky and poorly designed,"I bought this recorder because it had VCR+ and boy do I regret it. when you set the recorder to record in the future, it asks you if you want the recording to continue and when it begins to record, If you are not there to answer OK, it does not record.The remote is so insensitive you have to be 3 ft in front of the box to get any response which is incredibly slow. The ergonomics of the unit are devilishly frustrating, which lead me to believe that the unit is really some weird psychological experiment devised by Philips to drive American consumers crazy."
1,DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!,"I just got off of the phone with Philips tech support and couldn't believe what I was told. I rented 2 movies from Blockbuster and neither would play in this DVD player. At first I thought there was a problem with the DVDs and returned them. After round 3 I resurrected my old DVD player and they played fine. The tech support guy asked for the titles of the movies (Pursuit of Happyness and Stranger Than Fiction) and when I told him he promptly replied that they and about a hundred other titles have ""encoding problems"" and will not play on this DVD player. Of course after 3 weeks, I don't have the original packaging and so I can't return it, they won't authorize a return since there's ""nothing wrong with it"". Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't buy this piece of junk!"
2,femalefantsey!,i like it though i wish i could play with it im just gone hang it up my past buffy action figures had its leg broken (it came like that) and my willow one got both of its hands falling off in one day
3,Mediocre,"This bass head is mediocre at best. The sound is great, that isn't a lie, but it does require a pillow to be put in and shoved tight against the bass head for a good rock-n-roll punchy sound. Without a pillow, it still has a decent sound, but it's open and pretty ringy. Better for a genre like jazz, maybe. I've had mine for 4 months as of today (July 6th, 2012), and it is already starting to split. With the low durability, I will not be buying this head again."
4,"AMAZING illustrations, good telling...","I am extremely picky when it comes to illustrations and this book makes it to my top ten list. To give you an idea of my taste -- others in the top ten include ""In the Night Kitchen"" and ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"". I think detailed illustrations really capture a child's imagination and wow, does this book have detail! You will find something new with each reading. So, for illustration aficionados this book is a must have!Now, for the content...I'll admit it seems a bit dense for a children's book, but when you consider the source (Edmund Spencer's ""The Faerie Queen"") it's not really surprising. In the end I think I would have been disappointed with a watered down version to go along with the superb illustrations. Even very young children will be enchanted by the illustrations. I have read it often to my three year old daughter and she remains silently captivated for the entire reading."
5,Lovely book,"Our two grandsons love this book (ages 4 and 5) - plenty of knightly valor, and lovely illustrations. Not too gory slaying of a dragon! (That's the most admired page!) One grandson took it to school as his favorite book."
5,Great book,This book is sort of about St. George the Patron Saint of England. It has beautiful illustrations and is a bit more mythical on the legend of St. George and the last dragon. Over all a good book.
2,Saint George -- Gory and too long,"I purchased this book for my 4 year old based on all of the good reviews and the Caldecott medal. I was very disappointed, and I am planning on sending the book back to Amazon. This is a first for me because I generally love children's books. The illustrations in this book were beautiful, but the story was just not told in a very interesting way. It was very long and yet did not explain a lot of things and left loose ends. It was also very gory -- Saint George hacks off various parts of the dragon and the pictures show the dragon fighting with a hacked off leg. Yuck!"
2,Scared my 5 year old son,"This book was a disappointment, and it was a Caldecott winner? Initially, my 5 year old son was nervous with the graphic pictures of a chopped off tale and blood dripping from it. Then, when we read the story, he studied the illustrations, he was terrified! This from a child that loves dinosaurs. I am glad we did not purchase it and had only checked it out at the library first. The general story is good, and what talent the artist has it is just too graphic for little people."
3,I Liked It,I liked this quick number and read it all in one setting. Saint George slays a dragon and marries. Nothing special.
1,disappointing,"I was eager to read this book to my sons based on the great reviews it got from others. I was very disappointed when I got it, though. It is not well written so it didn't hold their attention. It is gory so it's not for little ones. Worst of all, it has inappropriate pictures (which I did not let my boys see) of unclothed fairies-these do not belong in a children's book."
2,This George NOT as brave as the Saint,"Undeniabley beautiful and I fully understand it is an adaptation of a story by Edward Spencer, but honestly people, the title of this book should not carry the name of ""Saint George"". There is a reason he is called a ""Saint"". History has held many courageous men that slayed beasts and saved princesses, but they weren't called ""Saints"". Saint George was viewed by the early Church as a saint for a reason. Search for it, and you will find the full story. This book merely embellishes one small part of the story. There is no need to reference any ""Fairy Queen"" in a story about Saint George, because there are enough fantastic events in the life of this saint that it doesn't require any pretend figures. Maybe someday an author of children's books will hold the courage of Saint George to tell the true story."
2,It must be a guy thing,"I found the plot of this book impossible to follow. It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason. And there are only so many times I can read variations of ""he swung his sword really hard"" and ""it was a really scary dragon."" The illustrations are quite beatiful, though."
3,"Nice pictures, but...","Having read the other glowing reviews that have been written about this book, I was prepared to be dazzled by it!Unfortunately, when I read it myself, I was left somewhat disappointed. The pictures were nice, but the wording definitely left something to be desired. Keeping in mind the age group that this was written for, I think the dialogue should have been simplified (you'll have to explain the meaning of many of the words and phrases, even to older kids) and shortened, if only into smaller paragraphs (more than twenty lines is way too long for a single paragraph! Kids' attentions will wander way before it's over!)It's an okay book to read with your kids (be prepared for them to interrupt you with a lot of questions!) but they might have a hard time reading it by themselves.If I were the editor, I would have told the author: ""Nice start for a first draft, but please--rewrite this!"""
4,Classic story written for kids,"I wanted my kids to know the classic story but didn't know there was a kids' version until I found this one. Very nice pictures and good storyline that isn't dumbed down too much. I would say this book could be read to a 6-year-old+ and they would ""get it."""
1,One Step Short of Wretched,"This is a very poor translation. It emulates King James/Shakespearian English, which is bad enough, but quite simply, some of the translations are flat-out absurd. A good example is Mary 19:7, which says that before John the Baptist, no one had the name John. That is just plain silly, and I had to check several other translations to find the real meaning (""there was no one like John before him."")I am not Islamic, but am curious and open-minded, so I read this. It was difficult to follow and, as demonstrated above, frequently (and extremely) misleading. The best translations I have found have been on-line. I do not recommend this book at all."
3,Dreaming of Christmas Memories,"The book is smaller than expected, but I did recheck the dimensions on the listing, and yes this would be correct. I found the pictures not as clear as I expected; however, still fun to have. My book did include the CD."
5,Twelve Ordinary Men,"Our Circle is studying The Apostles for the next two years. This book is a great addition on my study of the them. I also order The Master's Men to use along with this study. I have already found John MacArthur's description of Andrew very helpful and insightful of how we can be like Andrew who was not as well know as his brother Peter, John and others but was always there for the Master.Twelve Ordinary Men: How the Master Shaped His Disciples for Greatness, and What He Wants to Do with You"
5,"A great research book, for those who need the info","""Twelve Ordinary Men"" is a book full of reference material on each disciple, so you can better understand the purpose behind Jesus picking each one. I'm still reading the book as we speak, but it has blessed my soul since I picked it up. I highly recommend this for any one who loves to study the bible, it will be a great reference tool."
4,Excellent book,"This is the kind of book that reads well in bed at night. It is calm, interesting and generally informational. it is not a classic MacArthur book dealing with a hard-hitting theological issue.In fact, this book is the first one by MacArthur that actually reads into scripture a certain quantity of ""dot-connected"" conclusions. For example, the personalities of the apostles are described by MacArthur where there is no true description revealed in scripture.The chapter on Peter is fantastic, as is the one on Judas Isacriot. However, MacArthur's treatment of Nathaniel was my favorite."
4,Great refresher course on the lives of the apostles,"I consider myself to be pretty well versed in the Bible and yet found this compilation of information fascinating and informative. As a matter of fact, I could not put this book down and read it in one day. I was reminded of how obscure some of the 12 were.This book was very inspiring and reiterates that God has only sinners and faulty people to choose from. But who he chooses, he transforms.I highly recommend you read this book."
5,Allow me to introduce you,"What an awesome book!! I couldn't put it down and was introduced to some ordinary people I realized I never really knew. I do read the Bible and was delighted to meet some new precious friends, who in some cases remind me of people on this earth I know. I found myself saying to people ""I can hardly wait to get to Heaven and meet Andrew. This book is such a favorite I have given it to friends and family as gifts. It does start a wonderful conversation. People who read it will smile and delight in the knowledge that our Lord chose these people..people just like us with all our faults. This book really touches hearts and it is so educational. Enjoy!"
1,The Worst Book of Fiction I Have Ever Read,"If I had a dollar for every, ""could,"" ""might,"" ""one would think,"" ""probably,"" etc. etc. etc. I could retire. BAsed on little or no fact, it is an opinionated, account of the way the author would like things to be. A hoax. Read the next to last chapters. They are pure fiction. He says in 10 pages would could be said in two paragraphs. And they were not 12 ordinary men. They werer business men, tax collectors, fisherman who were at the top of the food chain as they owned boats, made a lucrataive living. My study group all but starting spending five minutes on a chapter. Waht a waste of my time. Shame on you for writing such a poor book. Now if you want to just pick facts to support a position and not look for the truth, then go for it. I would recommend reading ""Reading Judas"" as a factual account of the times and the way the early church really was. Written by Yale and Princeton scholars who use facts, not fiction."
3,Next,MacArthur is a popular writer and pastor and he took on a task that is difficult; describe the lives of men we know little about.Unfortunately the author throws too much of his own politics into ridiculous places throughout the book and he creates personalities out of nothing.A good discussion starter but not a seminal piece of work.
3,It's dry,"It was chosen by my church for a book study. The others really got into it, but I didn't. It wasn't a book for me personaly."
5,great resource and Bible Study,"After reading this book and using the accompanying workbook I taught a Bible Study on this and WOW...it was well accepted and loved. A unique view of the diverse personalities of each of the disciples, why Jesus chose them and how He molded them into devoted followers."
4,Review of twelve ordinary men,"The book is in fine condition. The only problem is that it has been written in a good bit, and many parts are underlined. It makes for distracting reading. Otherwise, the book is fine. Great price. Quick delivery."
4,the original dirty dozen,"I'm something of a fan of John MacArthur's writings and teachings... sometimes, i think the books may tend to beat a dead horse in a sense, proving and reproving the same points again and again, but the points are usually worth taking note of and he generally writes about topics that are relevant and engaging...Which brings me to this book... I've wanted to read Twelve Ordinary Men for quite a while and i'm glad that i finally got around to it... obviously, MacArthur deals with the twelve apostles and he delves into each of their characters and attributes... it's inspiring to see how God can use each of these character types and each of these men... even moreso, how Jesus reacts to them individually and as a group...There's a bit of speculation on MacArthur's part and, as expected, some repetition, but all in all, it was a book that really spoke to me and one that i was glad to have read...[...]"
4,God Uses Ordinary People,"John MacArthur, the veritable ""walking bible"", serves up an all too brief, but well supported glance at the men who would lead the spread of the Gospel immediately after Pentecost. MacArthur squeezes all details of the mens' lives (which in some cases is not much), and gives the reader the sense that these were real men of ordinary stature. He deftly drives home the point that what Jesus, then and now, is searching for is, AVAILABILITY. An easy, but informative read for anyone who desires to dig into the background of the New Testament."
5,Another excellent resource from John MacArthur,"It's just what we have come to expect from prolific author John MacArthur. Uncompromisingly biblical, extremely readable and immediately applicable, ""Twelve Ordinary Men"" looks into the lives of some ordinary men with an extraordinary God and gives the reader a deeper vision to see God do the same in their own lives."
3,Ehhh...,"This book was just ok. We bought it as our small group decided to do a study on the twelve disciples. It gave some insight into the proposed personalities of these men, but I found the book didn't hold my interest."
4,An encouraging reminder of God's sovereignty,"MacArthur demonstrates, with biblical and extrabiblical facts and inferences about the 12 apostles, just how God uses fallen humans to carry out his eternally predetermined redemptive purposes for His glory. Even Judas fulfilled God's decretive will, though in our finitude we cannot get our minds around this entirely.As one would expect, much more of this little book is devoted to the likes of Peter, James, and John, for example, as there is much more in Scripture recorded about their lives, backgrounds and actions. But lessons can be learned from the gleanings about the others as well, and it's well worth the time to learn."
2,I could only stomach the first half,"The first half of the book was somewhat interesting because there is more information available on the primary 4 disciples. But after that, with MacArthur's typical development of a theology from one or two words, the supposition was just outright fabrication to fit his opinion. I should have expected this from him, as it is totally in line with his edited bible which I own and use but critically discount as lacking logic. The speculation that was written as fact was laughable at time to downright absurd at other times. Really, if there is not enough information to go on, just admit it and move on. Maybe change the title to Four Ordinary Men and leave it at that, or stay broad about what they did overall instead of trying to write about each one individually. Disappointing."
4,great for anyone who likes quilting,"It's got pictures and it is a good guide. Of course, nothing beats a for real instructor, but this book simplifies it."
4,Took some of the fear away,"I have never quilted before, and have become strangely interested in the entire process. But I was afraid. VERY afraid. This book was great. After reading the entire thing, I realized that the whole quilting project is not as daunting as it initially seemed. Clear steps and concise instructions make even the most difficult things look possible. I actually think I might be able to do this!"
5,You'll be quilting by the end of the book.,"I always loved quilts, but never thought I could learn to do it. After only two days with this book, I have completed my first block -- and it looks really good!This book is excellent in that it tells you how to buy tools and fabrics, and explains what is truly essential vs. what is just a ""neat gizmo."" It explains the color wheel and a foolproof method of picking a whole color scheme for your quilt. At the end of every chapter, the author sums up the very basic things you should know -- a sort of ""cheat sheet,"" if you will.It also has tons of great tips that you would never think of asking about. I love the ""Don't get stuck"" items! Reading this book is like having an experienced quilter in your living room showing you how to do it step-by-step. Great book!"
2,For Hand Quilters not Machine Quilters,"If you machine piece and machine quilt I do not recommend this book. The author is so biased toward hand quilting and feels machine quilting is so much more difficult that she gives very little instruction, information or advice in this area. If you plan to only do hand sewing and hand piecing it is informative. There is very little information on strip piecing or rotary cutting, rather it mostly contains information on making templates. I found it unhelpful as I primarily do machine sewing and machine quilting of my quilts."
2,Not the most complete reference....,"As a skilled beginner (5 completed quilts), I wanted a good book on the fundamentals of quilting so that I could refer to it when I got stuck on a current project or pattern. Although this book has good information on fabric selection, I did not find it to be a good, complete beginners book. One of the most popular methods of quiltmaking is rotary cutting your pieces...not using many small, time-consuming templates. This book only gives instructions for using templates. Also, this book emphasizes hand-piecing (with some info on machine piecing) and hand-quilting (with very limited info on machine quilting). Although I admire those who sew quilts entirely by hand, these are not simple, easy, fast methods for a beginner. I will be looking for another reference book to use- one with lots of different methods explained, lots of color photos (few in this book), and lots of examples of finished patterns and quilts."
1,Not for Kindle subscribers,"This book is formatted in two sections, one for instructions with pictures referred to by color (Kindle is only in black and white making these references useless) and a second section for reference. The Kindle format requires the reader to read all of the main section of the book before getting to the reference section. I would love this book in traditional format, but find it ""non-user friendly"" in Kindle format."
4,Useful information for quilting,I thought the book was quite good. It was a great help with some of my questions but could have been more thorough on some of the sections. That being said I still think it was informative and would recommend for another beginner.
4,Great Book for Beginners!,I enjoyed this book. I found it quite easy to understand and I did not mind the aim twoard hand quilting. I machine quilt but still found it helpful.So many quilt books can be complicated so I appreciated the ease of this book.
2,Stepping Santa refuses to climb,"I purchased this item after getting acquainted with all of the Mr. Christmas animated music novelties. This one has been a disappointment. I bought it last winter (Feb. 2010) to add to my growing collect of Mr. Christmas items so I didn't find out until almost a year later that it doesn't work well. Two or three of the bulbs burned out withing two days and Santa will climb up and down but not without being nudged every single time. Santa gets to the top and stalls, then when nudged he climbs back down and stalls. I got tired of having to nudge it over and over and finally packed it away. It's too late to return it or I would. I don't recommend this item. A great choice that I would recommend instead is the Mr. Christmas Sledding Tower. It kept both me and my grandson entertained for weeks."
4,Stepping Santa is a Xmas ornament,"This new Stepping Santa worked well for the 2 weeks it was running, then we put it away for the season. However, I bought this one to replace another one that had stopped working that was purchased 2 years ago. Remember, this is a Christmas ornament and is not supposed to be dropped. The previous one fell over when Santa was at the top and Santa never worked again. FRAGILE!! The kids and the wife loved it so much, how could I not replace it? It is a nice piece."
1,Mr Christmas Stepping Santa,"I ordered this item on 30 November 2011 and I have still not received it, therefore I cannot rate this product, even though i have had to for the purpose of this review. However, as i do not have this item i cannot write a review for this product."
4,A fun christmas gift,A great gift for the hard to shop for and anyone with small kids. the smiles are worth it.
5,Wonderful piece of Christmas,"This was a great addition to our Christmas collection. I purchased the item before Christmas 07 and as of Dec 2010 it was still working as great as when we first got it. We put ours next to the tree so it appears Santa is stringing up the lights. It's convenient as you can adjust the volume. Cute purchase, would recommend."
2,IF YOU ARE NOT A NOVICE SAVE YOUR MONEY & FIND ANOTHER BOOK,"THIS IS A GOOD PRIMER FOR ANYONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TO A CASINO AND IS TOTALLY IN AWE OF ALL OF THE POSSIBILITIES FOR MACHINE PLAY. HOWEVER MOST OF US WHO PLAY WITH SOME REGULARITY AND HAVE ALREADY MADE OUR SELECTION AS TO WHICH GAMES ARE ""RIGHT FOR US"", ARE LOOKING FOR SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE OUR PLAY MORE SUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AS TO WHAT WHICH HANDS TO PLAY AND WHY, AND THIS TEXT HAS VERY LITTLE TO OFFER. I ORDERED ANOTHER BOOK THAT I FOUND TO BE MORE USEFUL DONE BY JOHN GROCHOWSKI AND TITLED THE VIDEO POKER ANSWER BOOK. I FOUND THIS BOOK FAR MORE HELPFUL. (NO, MR. GROCHOWSKI IS NOT RELATED TO ME!!). IF YOU COME TO LAS VEGAS YOU CAN LOOK ME UP. I'M THE ONE SEATED AT THE DUECES WILD MACHINE OFFERING MY COPY OF THIS BOOK TO ALL COMERS AT 10 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR."
5,Covers Over 150 Games,"If you are looking for an all purpose book on video poker this is the one I would recommend. The strategies are easy to understand becausethey are written in English and not in chart form. For novies such as myself, this helped me a lot. The book is a fun read as well because Frank Scoblete mixes the strategies with humorous stories."
3,Charles Atlas review,"It was well written. It could use a modernization for some of the exercises. Of course if that were done, it would no longer be the program that thousands of people have used over the years."
2,An Introduction To Atlas,"This product is basically a way for the Atlas company to keep the Atlas name in the minds of people. The Atlas course was written many years ago, but it is still very useful for people interested in natural body sculpting. It is an amazing course regardless of when it was written. The best part of this work is the wall poster that is included. But it is still very basic. Save your money on this and get the original Atlas course[...]"
2,Of its time...,"This item is a condensed version of an outdated, inefficient method for getting into shape. Most people will achieve minimul results and will not stick to the course due to its repetitious, boring nature.The nostagia items included in the box along with the condensed course are interesting, though, and the reason I gave this product two stars instead of one."
1,"Insert greater than 1/4"" had to shim tool, and wobbly shaft like a warped pool cue.",The header just says it all. Could have been just a factory odd piece that passed happened to pass inspection.
4,old school made new,"an awsome cd if you like slow metal/hard rock you'll love this one. The singer sounds a bit like Dio, in fact the whole albulm sounds like a newer version of Dio/black sabbath with out that chessie 70's style distortion.The keyboards are great and give the songs a darker mood to them.This is a must have cd."
1,999.99,"Little Pricey for a costume, is the child included or something. 999.99 I sure hope it is a mistake because if this is how prices are going there will be no bought costume this year, looks like we go back to creating them like in the olden daysDeluxe Kids Yoda Costume - Child Medium"
3,bike rack,"Great bike rack in theory, however was not aware that the bike rack does not fit Toyota Tundras, and that fact should be noted prior to someone spending the money for something that will not fit their vehicle. There are few bikes that are so versitile in this manner, it is too bad that it just did not fit my truck."
3,AMAZING!!,"What happens when women with low self esteem think that by sucking out some fat and adding breasts and hair extensions will fix who they are? This show was an embarrassment to women, I liked it but I shouldn't have. Ugly women trying to fix who they were by covering it up wwith makeup and then sticking these poor mud-ducks in a pagent ( what have we become?)I'm so glad that this show was taken off then air, but I'm happy to have it on DVD!"
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Funny!,"As a die-hard Baby Blues fan (...), I would definetly recommened this book. It has some of the earlier comics, and even includes lyrics to some original songs! A must-read!"
5,How'd he get the camera in our house? :-),"Baby Blues is the most hilariously accurate look at parenting I've run into in a while. Get the book, then pester your local newspaper!"
5,Excellent Resource for Doxie Info!,"My fiance and I are considering getting a dachshund. Before committing ourselves financially, we wanted to know what we were getting ourselves into. We purchased this book along with Dachshunds for Dummies and I feel like both of these books gave us a great window into the lives of Doxie owners. Neither of these books are written generically so that the publisher can just insert the next breed name into the title and publish it. The information was very dachshund specific. This book is full of great info from personality quirks to grooming tips to how to show your doxie to what to look for in a vet. After reading this book, my fiance and I decided that now was not the best time to bring a dachshund into our home. We'll wait until the conditions will be ideal for both us AND the dog!! BUY THIS BOOK if you want to know about dachshunds!!!!!!"
5,"Sharon Chance-Book Critic for the Wichita Fall Times, TX","""Remnants of an Ancient Past"" is an exhilarating new work from an exciting, talented new author. Crowley proves himself to be a gifted wordsmith that captures his readers' imaginations with his prose."""
4,Awesome Christmas Gift from Mom,"Just like the previous person. I also saw this at a small theatre in Illinois when just 5 or 6. I grew up at a local dragstrip (BYRON.) And witnessed ""Snakes"" and ""Mongoose's"" cars.Plus all the others in the video. I mentioned the film to my father in late August and asked if he remembered taking me and my brother to see it. He sure did. He loved taking me and my brother to the races. My father and I still attend the races together. I love it. My mother found this film on your site(AMAZON.co) and had to buy it for me for Christmas. Was I surprised. I have watched it three times already. Awesome! I wish I was a little older in those days. All I remember is the awesome paint jobs on cars like the Hawaiian and Showtime. Also the Army Tank Wheelstander. Thank-you in helping me relive my childhood."
4,Funny car legond,"Jim Dunn is one of the legonds of drag racing. This film offers an amazing glimpse into 'how it was' before all the huge sponsorships, hospitality tents, multi-car crews, etc. The day when a group of guys can get together and build a car more out of love, dedication, and hard work than money - long gone!"
4,With Memories,"This movie was pretty good~you really have to be a fan of the sport and old enough to remember these old cars and crews~The film really captured the sights and time in which it was made.Great old ""floppers""and the condition under which the cars operated in~I would recomend this to any die-hard fan.It not slick or ever the best resolution for a DVD~but it's worth watch over and over~Ah! Fond memories~"
4,"The Good Old Days, revisited!!","I grew up with drag racing in the '50s, 60s & 70s and this film gives a great view of what it was like. Saturday night match races with cars worked on by a bunch of guys in dirty Tee Shirts and racing for just a small amount of cash and a trophy. This gritty picture is in stark contrast to today's professional Drag Racing. I enjoy todays races for their speed but I miss the ""Little Guy"" races of the past. If you want to see how Drag Racing got it's start this is a great film to watch. Eye candy for ""Gear Heads""!!"
2,Dunn Family Home Video,"The title of the video would have been more appropriately called the Dunn Family Home Video, in my opinion. It was not what I expected it to be, as I had hoped to see more 70ish Funny Car Drag Racing cometition. The video follows the Dunn Family during a summer, and most of the footage is of them and not drag racing Funny Cars...Disappointing to me, but a real gem for a Jim Dunn fan!"
4,An interesting moment in time,"This DVD contains some amazing footage of 1960's and 1970's drag racing, and a chance to see current TV drag racing commentator Mike Dunn as a teenager working with his father. You're better off if you know the story before you watch this DVD, as the editing is a bit choppy, and at times the lighting is horrible. Overall, it's an interesting moment in time."
1,Gracious calling it home movie quality- I recomend something else,"This was basically a home movie of very marginal production quality as it was first released. No professional cinematography, no script, no plot. It was shot documentary style, and was perhaps of interest to a much smaller group of people- Insiders who knew the family and could mentally backfill into the movie everything it lacked for the rest of us. At least that's what it was. Today this docu-disaster has a dark grainey look to the film. What's it called(?)- Film Noir(?)... Nope. It's called very old film transfered through six generations of video tape and then finally copied to a DVD, which highlights all the reasons they should have let this one die off. In summary, even if you're a hard core drag race fan and interested in the visuals of what once was, you should pass this movie up like it was a four cylinder Chevy Vega with a blown head gasket."
3,race freak,good vidio for that era but it could stand to have more action. I did like the personal profile of the driver.
1,Horribly made movie.,"The Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The movie itself was made so poorly made, it was worse than a home movie; I had to laugh watching it. Unfortunately the movie did not have a descent cameraman. Still the time era did take me back to my youth but too much about Jim Dunn and not enough about funny cars & drag racing."
2,Lasted a couple of hours,This broke after a couple hours of use at the point where the tip is attached to the handle. I'm really not even sure how it was attached as I could see no evidence of a weld.
5,Best Gluten-Free Breadsticks Available,"I have a daughter with Celiac Disease who really misses authentic tasting bread items. She absolutely loves these, and I have to keep the rest of the family from eating them!!!"
2,Average,These are pretty average snacks for being gluten free. I like how low calorie they are. The taste can get annoying though. I know that I won't buy these again.
1,Shipping is messed up,"Why is it that their 5 day shipping and handling to California was coming out to be $26 plus on Amazon but only $5.77 on their site?Messed up? I would think so!This rating doesn't reflect on the clamp, just the seller!"
3,It Worked,I purchased this clamp to be able to assemble some picture frames. It was more light weight than I expected. I had purchased only one. Four probably would have made the project easier. The clamp was engineered well. Allowing me access to all the locations that I needed to nail.
5,Solid and works great,"Not much to say, the metal was solid, clamps clamped perfectly, made some great drawers."
5,very funny book,"Our 7-year old daughter Selene read this book to my wife and I. When she was done, we said ""Read it again!"" You'll see..."
4,Good info,"It's a textbook, what do you expect? But I must say that it was pretty informative. Needed this for a class in college. Pretty good."
3,Good alternative to the newer edition,"As the title says, this is a good compromise if you don't want to splash out and spend the money on the newer edition. There's not that much difference between the two in actual content, but obviously this edition is a little dated. There are a few changes in terminology, biut at the end of the day the images are still as relevant as when it was first published. Very straight-talking text with excellent examples of xrays shown...plenty of High res CT too!A bargin now as the new edition is out, but a good alternative if you don't mind it being a bit dated."
5,Really glad I bought it!,"I bought my copy from Amazon...It reached in mint condition :-). I have read only a few pages so far, but it seems to be a great book on thoracic imaging. I also talked to some of the attendings about the book and they all said that McLoud is a great author and a great radiology teacher. I am really glad I bought this book early enough to be able to make good use of it for my chest rotation."
5,Just buy it!,"Finely conceptualized, clearly written, and with copious examples and exercises. THIS IS THE ONE book to buy if you want to venture into playwriting. Bravo to the author!"
5,The Best,"This is the only book on the market that makes the process clear and exciting without long, dry chapters of lecturing. Hatcher gives you inspiring exercises along with a dose of terminology that balances perfectly. Buy this if you are teaching playwriting at the college level, or if you want to give it a try on your own."
1,not what i thought it would be at all,when i got this it was not at all like the picture. it was all loose and the buckles are all janky and don't look like the do n the picture.its not like leather type material either. it has like a cheap shining material. was very disappointed.
1,Poor Quality & Damaged,"My only positive feedback for these guys & this item is that it showed up well ahead of the expected arrival date. I got it out of the package, & not only did it not look like the glove shown (which I kinda expected.) it has a cut in it like someone slashed it with a box knife. Also, the thing is WAY too big for me, & I even have large hands. I'll definitely be asking for my money back."
2,Does not look like the one in the photograph.,"The photograph and the product do not match. They do not look like each other at all. The photograph looks black and the glove itself is a much lighter brown. The buckles on the product itself look like they need to be closed or secured, except they are non-functional so they just flop around uselessly. After I opened the box I compared it to the photo on the website. The buckles are completely different.Considering the price, I was not looking for real leather or amazing crafstsmanship, but I do expect it to look something like the photo. Right now I am debating to wear it once and be done with it, or return it, get my money back and not wear any kind of gauntlet. This thing might be too embarrassing to wear. I am usually very happy with anything purchased from Amazon, but not this time."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is garbage. Unless you have a gigantic forearm and a severely deformed hand, this thing will not fit you. Terrible quality, don't waste your time or your money on this nonsense"
2,"Cheap, but not accurate","Product arrived quickly but bear this in mind.Color of glove is taupe, not chocolate brown as pictured.Metal buckles are somewhat accurate, but they are gun metal finished and not shiny.Finger cut of the glove does not match the liner very well. It may fit better without the liner.The straps around the forearm have a shiny metallic strip instead of leather style.It will take some modifications to make it accurate."
3,Pass on the Best Hits Collections,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
4,Symbolizes Trials of Humanity in Love,"The character's all-mode love affairs are just that, complex with a never ending obstacle course. From a male's point of view, Dimitri's character symbolizes the breakdown of a man falling in love all over again, unexpectedly. The experience begins once Sloane opens the door with the key to his heart, as she did eleven years ago.The more I learned about the characters, the more the reality of my own relationship became translucent. On a very positive note, the character's personalities are perfectly in tune & ever-changing, yet moving in the same direction towards love.Enjoy the hours of uninterrupted music that this novel will bring. This love story will pave the way for a delightful evening."
1,Disappointing!,"Ms. Malemes is quite obviously new to writing, and I expected much more from this book. The characters conflict with-not one another-but themselves! Dimitri, the male protagonist, swings between being macho and self sure, to a crying, sensitive, wonderful guy. The author needs to pick a personality type, and stick with it, and the same it true for almost every other character.I also thought this book very reduntant and repetitive, and I found myself skimming many times. There were long, drawn out descriptions of characters, and the overall writing style was very amatuer.And, upon closer inspection, the reader of this review will find the above two written by none other than the author herself.In future books, we, being my book group, hope Ms. Malemes will put a little more effort into her books, and perhaps read a few guides to professional writing. And get a better checker for spelling and grammatical errors."
2,Sadly un useable,"I found this head set worked very good. The sound quality was good,the button to activate my phone worked flawlessly. The clarity of my calls both on the receiving end and on my end placing calls.I would have given it a better rateing except for the fact that I found the product unuseable because of the ear peices. They were way too large for my ears. They were uncomfortable after several minuites of use and when I removed the ear peices form my ears my ears were sore for awhile afterwards.I felt for the price it was no great loss."
4,Value for money,"I bought this item and initially there was a problem with the piece but BargainCell offered to replace it for me. The new piece works perfectly, and is good value for money."
1,Product falling apart,I have had the product for less than one month and already the earpiece is falling apart. I can see inside the earpiece where the wiring is.
2,Disappointing fit,"I was excited about getting these as I was hoping to use them while going jogging. But when I tried to fit them in my ears, they wouldn't stay. The left ear bud has a very short cord and the right has a long cord. They join closer to the left bud and that puts more weight on the left bud. The buds themselves are rather large and don't really fit well like some other headphones do with flexible ear buds.There is another OEM headphone adapter but that doesn't seem to be very good either, according to other reviews:Samsung OEM Hands-free Stereo Soft-Gel Headset for Samsung R510 U740 A707 A717 A727 D806 D807 D900 i607 T329 T629 T809 A303 M610 M620"
3,"Hey, did someone pressed the Rewind button?","Spinstress heroine walks into gambling den owner to ask him to forgo her brother's debts. She has a suitor whom the hero has a grudge against. Heroine, like Joan of Arc, offers her Pure Virtue as a sacrifice on the altar of our hero's lust. Hero proposes marriage of convenience...Even if I do overlook the utterly predictable story with predictable characters whom I can second-guess their thoughts and actions, there isn't much left to savor. The writing's readable, but everything about ""Seduced By A Scoundrel"" is uninspired and reeks of deja vu.Do read ""Too Wicked To Love"" instead."
4,Lots of Fun,"Fun book. Although classed as a children's book, adults will be amused with the clever verses that make reference to 10 of Elvis' best songs. The pictures are bright and with lots of activity to encourage conversation with any child too young to read the book by themself."
3,Only works temporarily...,"This deodorant works for most of the day if I'm not too active. With a lot of activity and subsequent sweating, I found that after about three hours it didn't work anymore."
1,how did this get such good reviews?,"This deodorant was as useful to me as not using any at all. I have no idea how it manages to get so many good reviews! Its expensive and ineffective, in my case anyway. I have only used it for two days after showering but it does not work on me. Maybe I'm really stinky!"
5,What a shock!,"I read about this product in the book Easy Green Living and now that I am on a 'green', all-natural kick I thought I would give it a try- albeit very skeptically. This deodorant is the best! I am a very, very active person. I bike everyday, weight-lift a few times a week, take yoga classes, and still have time to walk my dogs. I have tried every anti-antiperspirant/deodorant out there, especially the kinds that say they are for sports. I have never found one that worked which meant I was harming my body for nothing! After reading the labels I say they all had aluminum! Well, into the trash they went. With Crystal, I am completely satisfied. It is really weird because I still sweat, slightly, but there is no odor at all, even at the end of the day. And, I don't feel the need to re-apply all day either. It baffles me, but it works!"
1,Sensitive Skin Beware; Worked Well But Rash Developed After 6 Months Use,Sensitive Skin Beware; Worked Well But Rash Developed After 6 Months Use.I wanted a deodorant without the aluminum and decided on this product. I also used the roll on version. It worked well for about 6 months but then I developed an underarm rash. I think it may have been because I shave daily and the skin is broken and this product contains salt. My husband also developed a rash but not as bad as mine. We had to switch products. Once we stopped using it the rash went away but when I tried it again it came back. Needless to say I am never using this again. Be careful if you have sensitive skin or if you shave; it is like pouring salt on a wound.
5,Ritchie was a master,"He wrote few or no novels, but if you read Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine in the 1970s, you recognized a master at work. His stories are tight, compact jewels of plotting and wit, and the narrative voice always delights with its dry humor."
5,Tight,"I've read another collection of Ritchie's stories, ""The Adventures of Henry Turnbuckle,"" but this has more realistic, engaging, and concise stories, tales that range across the board from light humor to borderline Jim Thompson. The style is simple and straightforward, but the characters have little quirks that make them memorable. Certainly deserves to be in print again."
4,REMEMBERING THE EIGHTIES,"This is a great double CD with several songs not found anywhere else. The main dance classics on these CDs are by the original stars and in their extended 12"" versions. Some points of confusion are with track selections 2,8,& 9 on disc two. ""Some People"", by Cliff Richard (track 2), while a great eighties song is not what one would normally put with Hi-NRG selections. Tracks 8 (""You're So Vain"" by Chimira) and 9 (""Live To Tell"" by Blonde Ambition) are from 1996 and while Hi-NRG they stick out from the time frame of the other songs. MANY MANY other eighties dance hits could have been placed in these positions (like Rainey's ""I Can Fly"" or Phyllis Nelson's ""Don't Stop The Train)...still what is here is GREAT and you should grab this while you can."
4,A steal for this gem!,"I own a lot of these 12"" singles from when I was in a wax-buying binge from the mid-80's to early 90's, and this great compilation, with excellent sound quality (as we always get from Canada!) is a trip back memory lane. If you're a Donna summer fan, you must grab this just for the only 15-minute version (Patrick Cowley Megamix) of ""I Feel Love."" E. G. Daily' ""Love in the Shadows"" is riveting, and all the 12"" versions are sharp choices. I just don't know why they didn't just make the Pet Shop Boys ""Absolutely Fabulous"" the 12"" mix as well. That's rather silly. Grab this one while you can! It'll start your day well, and end it hopping!"
5,Hi NRG Classsic,"Why 5 stars ? No Frills Love/J Holiday - Eartha Kitt/ Where is my man are DISCONET mix's which are not noted on CD - So all you DJ's heads up - since each mix could cost 2x more for each mix. Dead or Alive is remix which is good - Menage is a remix of Cats ,Memory - great tune - Then Gloria Gaynor with I Am What I Am - the org. mix - J Tracy from Star Search & the Gong show , her Dont Leave this Way - Fair .. Donna Summer - I Feel Love - is a great remix also that would cost 2x more if sold alone"
3,"great songs ,great price","for the price of a single cd album you get a double cd set of 12 inch classic dance hits. i personally would pay the price just for patrick cowleys remix of donna summer's ""i feel love"".i consider the other songs in this compilation as bonus tracks.brand new lover,i am what i am,i like you,and memory are the only other tracks worth while. all the other songs sound like they could be found on any 80's movie soundtrack. there was one pleasent surprise, chimira's version of carly simon's ""your so vain"" is an excellent remake."
5,Classic Dance,"This has some of the greatest dance 12"" mixes of all time.. If you love NRG or just classic dance/disco this CD is worth every penny!"
2,Correction,"on page 66 there is an article written by The Dawson News. In that article it has a list of bodies recovered from the 1923 explosion. But there is one George Makris, my great uncle, that was killed in the 1913 explosion not the 1923 one."
3,Not what I thought it would be,I thought this would be Japanese hit songs but it was actually hit songs recorded outside of Japan that were hits in Japan. They were mostly american with a few european tunes thrown in. Good songs but not what I expected.
4,A terrific story!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. What impressed me most was how ""real"" the characters and the story remained from beginning to end. Jennie Shortridge did a wonderful job -- especially in the scenes that addressed cancer so closely. The author's newest book titled ""When She Flew"" will be released in November. I will definitely buy it."
4,Glad I Bought It!,"I found this book a little slow moving until about page 150. After that, I really found a deeper respect for the author's message, although I'm not sure this book speaks to me personally. I have never had the task of being someone's live-in respite care nurse, but I have seen enough people struggle through this that I can relate to the situation. I find myself empathizing with Ellie and getting wrapped up in her story-line over the Uncle Benny story. It's interesting to think about family secrets and the life your parents had before they had you. I can also relate to using food as comfort until even food isn't enough. I actually found myself wishing the author had included the recipes for Ellie's creations!"
