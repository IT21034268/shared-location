3,Andrews Sisters: Anxiety?,"I ordered the book. I was excited to know that there are others that enjoy the Andrews Sisters. After reading it, I found that the author repeated, over and over, the rifts between the sisters. Read the book. For all of us; music should be heard. ""Love your music lots! --"
1,not for instant video,"I guess the hard copy of this comes with a nice booklet, which they keep telling you to reference in the video. You don't get that w/ the digital version. The video is less than 30 minutes long and impossible for me to follow w/o the booklet. Maybe if you are more advanced you can follow it, but it is a beginner program. Worthless. Why would they make this an instant video?"
2,Not among the best of Osprey's,"I write from a modelmaker point of view. The book has an adequate but basic history of the war. However colour profiles has many bad mistakes: even the front cover pictures represents wrongly the post-war camouflaged Sea Harrier. The code of XZ451 was ""006"" during the hostilities. Colour plate no 4 has a same machine but a different text under it: ZA174 had a medium grey scheme. I also doubt that Argentine navy A-4 Skyhawk (plate no 8) wore Super Etendard style camouflage during the conflict (if ever). Photos are very useful even there is also pre- and post-conflict photos among them. Argentine losses are listed, British are not. But it is nice to read that Mr Chant tries to be neutral, for example, the ""own goal"" Gazelle loss (6th June 1982) is mentioned. I still believe this book belongs to modelmakers and historians desk but it cannot be trusted solely as an concise history of the Falklands air war."
4,Fairly good book,"The book is fairly good. Had a few factual errors (Rio as the capital of Brazil for example), as well as a couple of typos.Good description of the overall event, although light on the sinking of the General Belgrano, which was a major combat event in terms of significance and loss of life (even though not air combat related)."
2,Mr.Chant should put more effort in,"No pictures of the pilots,gun cameras or the ""MiG"" killing Harriers.Makes mistakes like the BBC reporters at the time by calling NAVY pilots ""Flight Luietenants"" and vice versa for the RAF pilots, as Luietenant. No in depth look at the battles or pilot's accounts.I think Commander ""Sharky"" Ward will do a backflip to see that he was in Mike Blisset's squadron,800 NAS, at one stage in this book.I really think Mr.Chant should get some tipps from Shlomo Aloni's books about the Isreali Aces."
1,just think twice before buying from this saler,"Iam really very feeling very bad for this order for the first time with amazon the brake pad i receive is not for the car i need well they are clever they write the same number on the packed but when i opened it was something , i ordered i brake pad for Toyota land cruiser 2006 for the rear and driver and they send me a green and blue packet and was not nice to see its only the color what inside is the same pads small pads i even don't know for kind of car its even not like the pads appear in the photos .....my advise is think twice before buying from this company"
2,Very old is not good,The Title is fine but the pages are very yellowed and extensively highlighted. Woops! Seven more words are reqiuired until my comments can be submitted. I don't believe it.
4,"Expensive, but worth it!","I've been using cheap razors, like the ones you get at the Dollar Store, for a few years now. I have a hard time plopping down $10 for a razor head. After mutilating my legs with the cheap blades I finally broke down and purchased the Intuition razor. All I can say is, Wow! What a difference a four blades instead of one makes! I've used my Intuition a few times now and can't imagine going back to the the cheapies...ever!As I mentioned before, the Intuition is a spendy little razor so I look out for the razor refills to go on sale. That doesn't happen too often in my area, but when it does I am one happy camper =)"
1,Schick Intuition unscented,"The Schick Intuition shaves well, but the unscented is stinky!I am sensitive to fragrance, so I was thrilled to see ""unscented"" on the package. But soon I realized that the perfume wafting all over my bathroom was coming from my razor. Now I have to keep my razor outside, which is, well, inconvenient.Scent is not necessary in a razor, folks! Let's make it truly unscented!"
3,at least I got it for free,"It's alright. It gives a great shave and love the fact that the fact that the shaving cream is basically built in (I share a bathroom with other college girls, and as you can imagine, space is a premium). However, the blades are almost $3 each a Kroger. They're cheaper on Ebay, but do I really want 72 blades?I had problems reaching some angles with it, especially when the soap was new. While I think it gives a better shave than the Venus, it's not a very good value. I also noticed that my blade began to rust (I did not use it every day, so it lasted longer than it would have) when the soap began to run low. I really liked the Silk Effects, but I haven't been able to find the blades lately."
2,Moisturizes maybe once or twice,"Nice design of the razor itself. The moisurizer cracks & breaks, though, after 2 or 3 shaves which renders the razor useless.Don't waste your money (and that's a lot of money for some defective blades!)"
3,First published in 1961,"It is important that this was first published in 1961, at the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Its point of view is from that time. It is worth reading, but no longer seems quite original, although perhaps it did at the time. Without dwelling on the reasons for the movement, Warren takes them for granted in his theory of the Great Alibi and Treasury of Virtue. In 1961, he could know nothing of the excesses of the movement, excesses typical of any movement driven by relentless propaganda."
4,A return to the fine from of vemod,"This is a highly atmospheric (read: mellotronic) work, much less angular than Nucleus, which I did not enjoy. Shades of early-middle King Crimson, with awesome bass and aforementioned mellotrons.Highly worthwhile."
2,Not the best,the plastic is rather weak. I have only used them for about 6 weeks (about 3 times a week) and it looks like I will need to replace them already.
1,Not worth reading,I'm not impressed. I also bought Sheet Music by Dr. Leman and that was much more helpful and brought me and my partner much closer and more satisfied!
2,humdrum,This product should be as much fun as being backstage at Miss America but it turns out to be as boring as being in the audience. It is recorded as if we are interested in the selection of cheerleaders as opposed to the cheerleaders themselves.
3,Strong blender - SILLY BREAKAGE!,"Loved this blender. As you've probably read it's loud - I MEAN 'PUT EARPLUGS IN' LOUD...it's like they took the muffler off of it! But it didn't bother me because it was such a good, simple blender. Then one of the blades for the cooling fan on the motor broke. How is that possible? The part is stamped from one piece of sheet metal. Anyway, nobody stocks that part...you can't get if from anyone. I guess when Oster assembles their blenders in the factory the cooling fans are carried into the facility by fairies with little wings. So everything works but I can't use it because the fan is busted and it vibrates like craze - out of balance. Have gone through a couple of blenders in a few weeks and I'm learning that the only way to get a quality blender is to pay $400 for a vita-mix. It's made in the USA, unlike these turds China keeps shipping over here."
1,Jar developed a thin crack line in a few months,Only after a few months the glass jar developed a thin crack line. I called the services line but was told the jar is not covered by the 1 year warranty. This never happened to me with other brands. I guess it's time to me saying good bye to all Oster products.
2,"Didn't like the product, it wobbles from the base","The jar was not stable until the blender was turned on. And even though the box said that it was a vintage style chrome blender, it looked more like a blushed stainless steel or brushed nickel. It was not what I expected, so I had to return the product."
3,"power good, glass flimsy","The glass container was extremely flimsy and I broke it right away. I ordered another container, which was much sturdier glass, but the bottom doesn't screw on well! On the other hand, I am very happy with the blending power for the price.If you order, be sure to get a heavy duty glass container!"
1,Do Not Buy!,"I received one of these for christmas 3 years ago. The metal shaft just sheared off and they won't replace it or repair it! I only made smoothies. Thus, I am telling everyone to not buy their blenders. It was obviously defective."
4,Good purchase,"Finally had to break down and buy another after my other blender died. This works very well for my wife's smoothies. Also looks great on my counter. I don't know why, but I never give anything 5 stars...someday, I hope to get over that."
1,Updated reivew.,"They all use a rubber drive coupling and if you use it hard it will break. I have 3 of these. Don't get me wrong I like them. The oldest is retired because it is over 30 and looks like hell. I use it for parts. The two I have now are this one and a cheaper one. They all have this rubber part. The newer ones have a poor design in the jar base screw. It's plastic and it breaks easy. I've been through 3 plus in 6 years. I did not buy mine here I got one At JC Penny on sale and one at Wallyworld.Update to my review. This is not a heavy duty blender. There is a rubber part in the ""ALL Metal Drive"" that will fail. The replacement parts are not as good as a new one most have dry rot and break quickly. I've got 3 and when I fix them I'm selling them and getting either a Warn Or Vitamix."
2,Great To Look At,"Looked great on the counter. Continually vibrated around when in use. Difficult to remove lid, too shallow. After a couple years of occasionally making smoothies, the rubber axle sheered off with the blade. Waste of my hard earned money. Not made of the same quality as Gramma's, she used hers for a couple decades, and made strawberry smoothies all the time."
2,Poor construction on parts,"After reading mostly positive reviews I thought I would give this blender a try. Very quickly the sealing ring was shredded which other reviewers had mentioned happened to them as well. Now the plastic base is now cracked once again rendering the blender useless. In six months time, with limited use I wouldn't expect this poor quality from a blender that isn't cheap. I also don't like how the glass pitcher doesn't attached securely to the base. It will turn when the blender is on. You have to hold it in place. This one is being returned and I am trying a new blender."
1,Not very good,"I purchased this blender - after reading reviews of the breaking drive mechanism, etc. I make a lot of fruit smoothies (frozen fruit, juice + other ingrediences). Knife/axle separated after 2 months of use. This is not a solid blender - probably good for very light duty. The drive mechanism, although looks like 'all metal' is really held together by a rubber fitting. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Decent blender,"Not a bad blender, speed and power are about average. Looks nice with other stainless and metal finish appliances in our kitchen. On a polished granite countertop, it tends to rotate around on its own when in use, the rubber feet do not keep it in place. This means you need to stand there and hold it while it is running, kind of a nuisance. Overall it seems to be of the same quality of build and materials as other comparable products on the market. Has now worked fine for about 2 years, nothing wrong at all, can't say that about my 2 previous KitchenAid $120 blenders!"
2,not really...,"this product is too bulky and just make too much noise. i read the review that this blender doesn't make too much noise,.. well it does actually i only used a few times due to its noise it disturbs everyone in the house :("
3,Fantastic customer service,"When I received this item the top was cracked. I contacted the seller and received extraordinary customer service. She ordered another top and had it sent to me; even followed up to make sure I received it.That being said, The blender itself is a little disappointing. The glass container doesn't seem to fit well on the base. I have to keep moving it around to try and get a tighter fit. On one occasion, all the contents splashed out of the bottom causing a major mess."
2,"Plastic, not chrome","For starters, I didn't actually use the blender so I can't comment on its performance. I was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box and found out the base is made out of plastic, not metal. That is, apparently, the drawback of buying things online without seeing them and thinking that ""chrome"" means more than just a color. The base is a brushed nickel sort of plastic but the circle part that holds the jar is a shiny ""metal"" plastic. In my opinion, the ""metal"" plastic makes the blender look kind of cheap. If I wanted a blender that is going to look somewhat cheap, I wouldn't spend $50+ on it."
2,Terrible LID,"This blender was nice for about 3 months. The round rubber lid is HORRIBLE - i think it shrinks with use. I'm not sure why other reviewers didn't mention this. It's like not having a lid at all - water goes everywhere. I tried getting a replacement lid but reviews said that it was worse than the original. I am hoping that the square design will work. Also, the plastic attachment that keeps the blade sealed cracked on mine, so that's another weak point. I thought i had found a solid blender.. but turns out it's not quite there."
2,Good until it broke,"Bought this back in April in order to make protein smoothies. Worked fine until it broke in October. The cam which connects to the blade broke. It is apparently built around a plastic core, which is what broke. Tried to find someone to repair it here in Richmond, Va, but no dice."
2,"I've burned this one out twice, now...","As pretty and ""classic"" as this is, performance-wise, we are underwhelmed.1) It is screaming loud, seriously, you can't talk over it. Turn it on and leave the house.2) It doesn't do all that well with ice or frozen fruit. We got it because the box said it would crush ice, but it never really did, we ended up just using the crushed ice option in our fridge's water/ice dispenser.3) We've had it for two years and it's broken twice. The first time it broke, the mechanism that the jar sits on and spins the blades torqued off, so my husband got online, ordered a replacement part, and fixed it. It's a year later and the same part broke again when I tried to blend frozen fruit and milk for a smoothie.Go with a different brand or model, we've been pretty disappointed in The Beehive."
2,Not good for ice crushing,"After reading all of the positive reviews,I thought this blender was a pretty safe bet.I bought it just a little over a month ago, and we use it for making protein drinks. At first it worked great. Crushing ice was no problem. Now after using it about 15 times, it does not want to crush the ice. I have to turn it off and stick a spoon in it to move the ice around and get it to start again. Very frustrating. I am learning that truly good blenders are hard to find, and the learning curve is getting expensive. I guess I will have to break down and spend $400.00 on a Vita-Mix."
2,"Good, but not durable","We've had this blender for almost a year. I mainly used it to make smoothies. It did an alright job but I frequently had to stop the blender, stir contents with a spoon, repeat over and over. Today the metal shaft that drives the blades sheared off. Looking for a new blender now...."
2,BEWARE 4096 is still great -- but is the model above a 4096?,"Please note: I give my blender *****. But this review is now appearing other under models -- eg the 4072 -- without my consent. Does the 4072 or other models have the all metal drive? Check that carefully.HAd it more than a year, and still leased.. You don't need more speeds -- that's just silliness. Somebody puts on X speeds, so then somebody comes up with X+1. Just more plastic to break. And who knows if you can find parts? Maybe if it was mapde yesterday.For the Oster, the metal on metal is reassuring and you know that you can find parts. And it has that classic look.Frankly, there are too many models. I am no longer so sure that I can find parts."
5,Great read for boys and girls!!,"Scramble! is a great story about friendship. Set in in World War II with the main character, 12 year old Harry Winslow. Harry, who has become friends with the fighter pilots at the near by RAF base has great adventures while learning life lessons in respect, responsibility and freindship. GREAT Illustrations!! Very positive message!! Young boys and girls will love it..as well as some old ones!!"
5,Intoxicating and beautiful,"This CD went on at a small get together I was at and it litterally stopped conversation. ""Who is this?"" everyone asked. The case was passed around and appraised by the guests. It was an immediate hit among the 7 people in that house.Hopefully, not to the artist's offense, Cole Marquis projects the wonderful moods and melodies of Mark Kozelek (Red House Painters) and Elliot Smith amidst dreamy noisescapes or simple acoustic accompaniment. Not really the kind of music you'd expect to hear at a party, but more than welcomed when you do. I'm still waiting on the arrival of this CD and everyday, my thoughts of it grow fonder. Everyone should check it out, if you're into that sort of thing."
4,Bluesy/Folksy,"If you like the blues/folk style of artists like Marc Cohn, you will really enjoy this compilation."
1,Open All Night - On the Road,What a collection of boredom! I listened to this a couple times and have to admit i just don't get it. Some very fine artists but what's the point of this ? I could have asked any number of friends to make a compilation from their own cd closet and traded from mine and any one of them would have been at least as interesting. i can't believe i paid regular price for something i could have done myself. That's what i get for reading a review/rating done by the cd's producer.
4,"Fuzzed out riff-o-rama: awesome, but too short...","As you might guess from their name, Bongzilla aren't shy about expressing their pro-weed worldview. Fuzzed-out guitars, slow ultra-heavy riffs, spoken-word samples and tortured EYEHATEGOD-like vocals are the order of the day, and it sounds awesome. Fans of SONS OF OTIS, ELECTRIC WIZARD and any heavy stoner rock will probably like this. My only real quibble is that there are only three new studio tracks. The remaining four, making up the disc's 48 mins are live versions of material released elsewhere. It's worth buying, but those new to Bongzilla might prefer to buy Gateway."
5,I've Never Seen Such Glorious Squashes.,"This book started it all for me. I love squashes and this is the book to read. It has all kinds of squash like some of my favorites are Marina Di Chioggia and Fordhook. If you order this book, DO NOT send it back. This book is highly recomended."
3,Very Few Mid-Range Hikes,"I generally like Schneider's guides, and appear to be in the minority here, but I did not love this one. It is a surprisingly thick book with lots of trails; unfortunately most of them are either short tourist strolls or long, multi-day back country excursions. We had difficulty finding hikes that called out to us in the 12-16 mile range (usually not a problem for us - most guides leave us wishing we had 2 weeks to do all the long day hikes we are interested in) and ended up going with ranger recommendations when we got there. If you have 5-10 days for a backcountry trek, this is definitely the book for you. But if you are looking for long day hikes you may want to look elsewhere."
5,hiking newbie,"The organization was strange, but OK once you get the hang of it. The content was excellent. Just the right level of detail. Although I'm new to hiking (and Yellowstone) it made me confident about choosing 3 2-night backcountry options. Until I got this info I was confused. I guess I should wait until I do the hiking next month to compare the sites I got with the recommendations, but it was the help in planning that I appreciated."
5,More classic metal from Axel,"This may be the best album yet from ARP. In the context of his other excellent work, that speaks volumes. There are some classic tracks on offer here: the title track is outstanding and restrained, a ballad of the highest quality; ""The Gates of the Seven Seals"" rocks hard in some places and goes slowly in others; ""Carousel"" has a memorable chorus, and ""Pay the Price"" is pure ARP metal. A great album, highly recommended."
4,This guy is awesome,"The ""German Malmsteen"" is,r eality, better than Malmsteen. He can play all the high sped solos, reach all the notes, but also can compose with more ""heart"", and has a less mechanical approach to songwriting than Malmsteen does.Its a very good album, very good."
4,starfighter vehicle,"The toy itself is great, but when we opened the box it was missing the weapons that were supposed to be included. There were some kind of missiles that are supposed to attach to the starfighter that were missing."
3,Really 2 and a Half Stars,"I read the reviews here and based on them spent money on this movie, but I would advise others to first hire it before deciding on buying.A lot of the good things people have said are true - Pertwee is good, there are scary moments and in many places the movie works. However, it becomes pretty standard after the first half hour and not so scary anymore. And the female role is sort of not well enough done. Nothing wrong with the actress .. the part just isn't thought out enough.It's not like Predator and Aliens really, but it could have been. That's the sad thing about horror these days - its never as good as it could have been."
2,"OK AT TIMES,BUT SLOW AT OTHERS","This movie is something between a scifi and a horror. Its Predator meets The Howling. It starts out with a group of soldiers training in a combat sim in Scotland I believe. They later encounter these half man,half dog creatures, however not original at all but still ok at parts during the action. The main problems that bring this DVD down is this is by far the worst quality DVD I have seen(hands down)it has a film like appearance with lots of grain on the screen,by the way I have a 32INCH HDTV AND PROGESSIVE SCAN DVD PLAYER,WITH COMPONENT CABLES,so its not my imagination this is really awful being that this was released in 2002,because I have Halloween(1978),Stage Fright,A Nightmare On Elm Street (1,3,6)and they look great on DVD. So if you can get over the bad picture and some hard to understand accents, then give it a try,otherwise just stick to the classics"
2,Dog ***,"This movie was truely not what I expected. It has an excellant plot but the werewolves were second class.When a military team is on a rutine training mission in Britain they happen to run into some not-so-rutine forest inhabitants. They find a survivor of a previous military team who is badly injured. While giving him care black figures appear in the trees.The werewolves were very cheaply done, typical people stuffed in suits. The little bit of animation was terrible a sixh grader using photoshop could have done better.There was a comical scene where one of the soldiers, cornered in the kitchen of an abandoned house decides he won't die easy. He takes the werewolf on in a boxing match. The werewolf being so shocked by this attack get licked (and stabbed) pretty bad. Upon the verge of victory the soldier is killed by another werewolf.All in all an ok movie for the true werewolf lover. However if you like it then buy it."
5,Werewolves vs Soldiers,"I First saw dog soldiers on the scifi channel. I was skeptical at the beginning but it picks up like a tsunami, Kevin Mckidd is an excellent actor and the rest of the cast does great in their roles. The story is simple and riviting. A group of british soldiers are sent on a basic war-games mission against a special forces unit. But when the unit is found in several thousand pieces the soldiers must gather their courage and team up with the only survivor of the attack and it just so happens a young scientist picks them up in her truck and explains she has been studying a family of lycanthropes, or werewolves. She fills them in and they dig into a farm house to wait till morning. but will they last and who can they trust?"
5,great movei,I think this is one of the better werewolf movies around. The special effects aren't great but over all it isnt your regular run of the mill werewolf movie. If you like off the beaten path movies then you will like this one.
4,"""Dog Soldiers""","I surprisingly enjoyed this movie. It is a little choppy and hard to understand what is going on at first, but it is well worth the watch. Especially if you are a werewolf movie fan."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Presetation","Dog Soldiers is a ton of fun! I won't get into a plot review, you can find plenty of reviews here and at other sites if you'd like. So here's a head's up on this edition. The DVD picture quality is quite poor. Fortunately it didn't distract my ability to enjoy this movie, but I will be searching out higher quality copy once one is available. Just to note, this is coming from someone who is NOT snobbish or nitpicky on picture quality on DVD's. And in case it's important to you, there are NO extras or special features on this DVD edition. Better video quality and inclusion of any features would garner this product 3.5-4 stars."
4,Best Werewolf movie in recent times,"Werewolves & action movies have always intrested me, This movie is by far the best Werewolf movie I have seen in MANY years, i enjoyed it again and again."
5,great movie,very good movie without all of the computer generated special effects. will stand the test of time.
2,The movie is awesome. Blu-Ray is grainy.,"That about sums it up. Just wanted to throw in my two cents.As others have stated, the picture quality is really bad for Blu-Ray.Amazon seems to like to combine all movies into one bucket, regardless of media type. I would recommend, when searching blu-ray titles of older movies, to always sort the reviews starting with the newest first. Had I done that, I would have passed on the blu-ray version and purchased the DVD, which obviously appears to be of better quality.The surround seemed to be somewhat disconnected from the front stage as well. I didn't get that feeling of being immersed in sound on the Blu-Ray version. Bear in mind though that this is an older movie.In any event, I would recommend purchasing the regular DVD over the Blu-Ray version.My rating is based more on the transfer and sound quality. The actual movie is absolutely awesome and should be a fixture in any horror fan's collection!"
4,DAMN GOOD WEREWOLF MOVIE,"I really wasn't expecting much with this movie but I was pleasantly suprised. You really don't see much of the werewolves but sometimes it what you don't see that makes for a good horror movie.What you do see is some good gore, and what makes it even better is this is a movie that you can find at your local Blockbuster right in the middle of all of those crap horror movies. If you see this in your local video store, don't pass this one up."
3,Solid Not Spectacular,"Good show. Definitely better than the Scream clones out there. Won't give away the plot other than to say that there is too much of it. Soldiers inside, Werewolves outside would have been fine but the tension disappears at the end with a couple of feeble plot twists and too much ""I love you man!"" hysterics. Interesting to note that most good horror movies are made on the cheap. Not a great movie by any means (the fact that its been reviewed so highly illustrates the dearth of good stuff) but a solid hour and a half of good horror."
5,Neil Marshall makes the horror genre proud,"Dog Soldiers is like the movie Aliens, but with giant bloodthirsty werewolves running around and ripping people to shreds. They are actually quite scary here, mainly because the director smartly keeps them in the shadows for the first half of the film. The werewolf costumes blow away all the CGI junk that fills the movies nowadays. The entire cast (especially Sean Pertwee & Kevin McKidd), the remote woodland setting, the gore effects and the twist ending are all top notch. If I had to make a list of my favorite Neil Marshall films, it would go something like this.1. The Descent (5 out of 5 stars)2. Dog Soldiers (4.5 out of 5)3. Doomsday (3.5 out of 5)They are all worth seeing, but Dog Soldier might be one of the best horror debuts ever. Move over Eli Roth and learn something from this guy. If you ever wanted to see a werewolf horror/action hybrid movie where the monsters are actually intimidating, this is your ticket."
3,Woof,I enjoyed this movie. I also believe that Kevin McKidd was in the HBO series Rome. The only shortcoming of this DVD was it stated that there were supposed to be extras when in fact there were none.
4,WEREWOLVES,"I must say that after seeing this movie on television before, i was inpressed with the overall movie. I then decided to buy it on blu ray and it made it that much better. I love werewolf movies, and this one actually looked real instead of a costume."
4,Good foreign flick,"This movie shows what an accent should sound like, thick, rich and full of colloquialisms. Nice photography. The reasons DS dosen't get five stars in book are (A) the werewolves don't look all that convincing, allthough the ""changing"" scenes are some of the best I have ever seen (B) It is a little long for a horror/thiller movie. Good movie to buy, or rent."
1,"""HIGHLAND DUNG!""","This one's a real clunker - so grainy and gritty [visually] that it's practically uniltelligible - silly romp - complete with what looks like cardboard cut-out lupine silhouettes.Ranges right there -where it belongs with ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""ARF! ARF!"
1,D-U-M-B!!! Crap!,"Trashy made for SciFi Channel movie or at least looks and sounds like it should have been, a heaping steamy piece of dog doo!. I fast forwarded most of the way through, it's bad all the way around, every which way but loose terrible!. For fans of ""Python"", ""Boa"" ect."
1,disappointment,I cannot rate this item because I never received it. I wasn't informed it was not available until the due to me date came and went. I was very disappointed.
1,GARBAGE!!!,"This waste of film doesn't even deserve one star... Michael Jackson's ""THRILLER"" video was scarier than this heaping pile of junk! If you want horror, stick with the classics (basically, anything before 1990). I think they hired high school drop outs to do the special effects for this piece of trash. The werewolf faces look like stuffed heads stolen from a lodge or something."
1,worst movie i have ever seen,"this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. It is slow movie, the characters are hard to understand, and the special effects aren't that great. Don't waste your money on this movie."
4,Neil marshals debut,"Tired of cgi,characters you don't care about and predictable deaths then dog soldiers might be the movie for you. The werewolf has always been my favorite horror character and dog soldiers might be my favorite werewolf movie. For many reasons dog soldiers far exceeds its limitations of a relatively small budget. One of those reasons being its acting the soldiers joke,don't make a lot of stupid decisions and seem to care about each others safety. The movie also makes great use of its relatively few locations using them to create a great atmosphere. The villian is also played well and the werewolf suits while not all that convincing are much better than cgi. The writing is very good as well. And the blood flows freely and often enough to satisfy most horror fans. A big plus for me is also the all the practical effects i always found them much more effective than cgi. So in closing you should not be disappointed by dog soldiers."
3,"Enjoyable, engaging B horror flick","I'll echo the sentiments of the other reviewers here - this is a B horror flick, apparently intended to be consumed not by the general public but by fans of the genre. For fans, it will be a pleasing and enjoyable watch. I found the references mentioned in the other reviews (the reviews were the reason I got the film from the local video store) to be well-done; in some cases, they were careful, almost sly, while in other cases they were more obvious.For the record, the script is good but has some weak points. The acting, on the other hand, is better than what we've come to expect from this type of film.I'd say it's a worthwhile film to watch. You're going to like it."
4,Werewolves of London.,"This has got to be the best werewolf flick I've ever seen. With tongue thoroughly in cheek, DOG SOLDIERS would make an excellent double feature companion with ARMY OF DARKNESS (or any EVIL DEAD film). Great use of budget with the wolfen effects, they look creepy enough without any CGI, and are presented in a menacing way. All aspects of this film are well done, from the excellent performances (SEAN PERTWEE is a great actor) to the taut direction and swift, exciting pacing. Works great on both levels of action and horror without taking itself too seriously, making this movie down right fun to watch. Excellent DVD bears good sound and picture for some bloody good late night viewing."
5,"This Movie is fun and gory,just what u need!!","Because Dog Soldiers is desgined for a new breed of horror fan it has a few of the usual things you predominantly expect a werewolf movie to have incorporated in it.Like a full moon,howling etc.But this film promises way more to the viewer than Ginger Snaps or The Howling combined its fun to watch and it has some shock value as well,but if you buy this movie or at least watch it then you will discover that for yourself.Overall i thought this movie kicked bum and i have not seen a better werewolf movie released in a good few years,so if you are into this type of movie or even if your not just check it out and enjoy!!!"
4,A Must-See For The Werewolf Fan,"A fiercely intense horror about a squad of British commandos and a female civilian trying to survive the night in an abandoned farmhouse in the Scottish Highlands against a pack of werewolves.From the moment a mutilated cow falls down an embankment smack into the middle of the soldiers' patrol the action in this film is nonstop. Towards the end is an excellent fight scene with the men out of ammunition, literally fighting tooth and nail with the werewolves. They don't know if they'll be alive another second - neither will you the viewer.Although there are a few holes in the plot and some of the situations seem contrived, this little known British production has gained a well-deserved cult following over the last four years. In my opinion it is one of the best werewolf flicks to have been released in a long time."
2,"Great Movie, Not So Great Blu-Ray","Great movie, terrible transfer. This Blu-Ray disc seems to be just a few notches up from the DVD transfer. Muddy, grainy and often soft. And hardly any extra features. I guess for the low price it's worth the upgrade to hardcore fans, but overall I'm not sure why this is on BD when the transfer hardly warrants the price tag."
3,"Good, but not Great","It's lean and well put together with pretty good characters and a few effective gross-out moments. It doesn't even seem particularly low budget--they may have skimped on the werewolves, but they're reasonable.However, this isn't very scary at all---it doesn't really engineer those moments of tension like some of the movies it's compared to. Plus, the end kind of fizzles. So, pretty good, but..."
3,good movie but lame special effects,"I heard so much about this movie before its release, that when it came out I immediately went out and bought it.It is a good movie and it is scary, but the werewolves are so fake looking it kind of ruined it for me.The acting is fine, the plot is fine, the blood and guts are realistic, but WOW! the werewolf costumes are bad!If you can ignore the bad costumes, the movie is good, but rent it before you buy it."
5,well done,superb cheesy horror flick. low budget but extremely well done. been looking to add this to my collection for some time. one of my favorite Werewolf movies. :-)
5,One of our favorites...,"""...and I expect nothing less than gratuitous violence from the lot of you!"" Hooked from that line on. Don't care what any other reviewers say this movie is tops in my book."
4,Awesome Werewolf Movie!,If you like werewolf tales you definitely want to pick up this dvd for your collection!An interesting twist on the werewolf concept. Pretty action packed all the way from start to finish- and what a finish it is!I totally recommend this dvd be added to any horror collection.
5,Bark At The Moon!,"Imagine a cross between ""Night Of The Living Dead"", ""The Howling"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""Southern Comfort"", and ""Assault On Precinct 13"", and you'll be fairly close to describing this movie. I am a huge fan of werewolf movies! This is my personal #1 of all time. Soldiers playing war games suddenly find themselves at the bottom of the food chain. It seems that werewolves are about, and they're very tough customers! Sean Pertwee and Kevin McKidd are downright believable (as are the entire cast) as macho fighting men who become prey for flesh eating beasties. The soldiers make their last stand in an old farm house. It's military might and skill vs. supernatural horror! Who will win? Who will even survive the night?? What terrible secret lies beneath it all? Destined to be a classic..."
3,"I liked it for it's ""macho"" angle","The concept of being trapped in a house, in the middle of nowhere, with not only a threat of monsters from outside but also inside has been done to death.What distinguishes this werewolf film is that the potential victims are itchy triggered soldiers that are not going to go down so easy. That is what creates the fun conflict in this film.Hand-to-hand combat with a werewolf...that gets my vote. More of these horror movies should have harder to kill protagonists rather than easy to kill, passive victims."
3,"Great early film by the director of ""The Descent"" and ""Doomsday""","This played in the U.S. largely on the SciFi channel. It's sort of the yang to the yin of Marshall's ""The Descent"" - that film being a group of gals attacked by monsters, this is a group of male soldiers attacked by werewolves. Marshall has a great B movie sensibility - not too heady to get pretentious, not too lacking of brains to be thought of as totally dumb. This could even be thought of as ""Aliens"" with werewolves - Either way it's a great early effort by a director that I'm still waiting for even bigger, better things from."
3,"Get the ""regular"" release if you want the extras","Great movie--it deserves 5 stars. However I bought this as a replacement copy and was disappointed to see the extras from the original release aren't included in this one. The audio quality is poor as well, noticeably worse than the original. In short, get the movie, just not this release of it!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A slick low-budget combination of action and horror delivered by pre-Descent Neil Marshall, Dog Soldiers feels a little pointless when you realize that since the soldiers don't have silver bullets there's not a whole lot they can do against the werewolves, but it's still an enjoyable and skillful film that benefits a lot from not using CGI and for employing such dependable British character actors."
5,dog's!!!!!,These dog soldiers are nothing like you'd ever seen. Check out this terrifying chiller in the tradition of Predator and An American Werewolf in London.
3,Who Let The Dogs In ?!!!,"If you like non-stop military action,you will like this movie.If you like blood and gore,you will like this movie.If you like monsters, in this case werewolves,you will like this movie.The cinematography and music are very good.I knew from the opening sequence, when ourBritish Army ""heroes"" land for their jungletraining exercise, soon to go very wrong,that I was watching a far better than averageaction/horror film, and it stayed that way.The characters are cliche, but in a good way.Some of the gross out stuff I considered to begratuitous and it detracted from the film.That kind of thing is unnecessary when you havea quality presentation.This is no gothic werewolf story,it is a full-on military action filmwith the enemy being a group of nasty werewolves.Turn out the lights, buckle yourself in,check your blood pressure,don't bother with the popcorn and enjoy.These dogs don't want to go out,they want to come inand God help you if they do."
3,I Hope I give you the %&$%s!,"For buying it used, it was a noteworthy title to add to my horror collection. The wolves reminded me of a lost concept with present day horror. They were more scary when you barely see them. Then they show up, you are like ""heh,. oookay."" However, I thought the actors made it enjoyable. It's hard to see how ths was showed on the Sci Fi channel. Lots of censoring?"
3,the wolves come out to play,"this horror film has a group of soldiers who go on a training mission and end up being other end of a pack of werewolves who chase them down. they hide in this womens house where they all barricade the place down. soon things happen when the wolves come out and they have to defend themselves with everything they've got. the action is first rate with some gruesome werewolves with a superb twist of ending which you dont even care about the stupid stuff you just want to see who survives the wolves. starring Sean Pertwee (Soldier, Event Horizon, Formula 51), Liam Cunningham (First Knight), Kevin McKidd and Emma Cleasby. if this is your cup of tea, then enjoy it, otherwise **it or get off the pot"
4,YOU'LL JUMP OUT OF YOUR SKIN,"A visceral werewolf masterpiece.DOG SOLDIERS (Artisan) is about a bunch of soldiers playing war games in the wilds of Scotland who come across a slaughtered rival team. In the darkness, something not human and not animal awaits. Holed up in an abandoned farmhouse, the humans begin the fight of their lives. And dawn is hours away. An urgent, terrifying chiller.You'll jump out of your skin when the werewolves of Scotland attack."
3,predators meets the howling,"this film may be low budget, or at least not a major studio release, but it is a rather nicely done film. As others have noted, its a familiar plot, but somehow manages to take on a life of its own and keep the viewers intrest peaked. Another nice touch is the way the film teases the viewer by witholdingthe sight of the beasts, giving little tid bits here and there until way into the film. The flim seems to have a fascination with entrails, as several scenes of decapitated bodies, andentrails are flaunted, giving the film its grittier than most feel. The tension level works as the team of soldiers find refuge in a cabin, that becomes more of a prison than a haven.So, if you liked the Howling, which I thought was a terrific film, and the Predator, then you should do ok with this one."
2,DOG head wolfweres look alike,Overall this movie delivers some good horror moments however one thing that bothers me is that a soldier stabs a werewolf to death(in the kitchen) when they can't kill the werewolfs with machine guns in close range. C'mon. And it's too dark and I can hardly see the actions.
2,Nice Try.,"I watched it last night and I thought it started out really well. But as it went on it asked alot of questions that for me, were never answered. A bit gory as well. I don't want to give away any of the plot because I know some of you will find this movie fascinating, and I salute you. But for me, it can't hold a candle to classics like ""Southern Comfort"" or ""Aliens."""
2,Dog of a movie,I thought the idea for the film was ok and had promise but it ended up being kind of stupid. Not the worst I have seen and it could have been done a lot better. Save yourself the money and wait for TV release
2,DO NOT BUY BLU-RAY VERSION,Save yourself the money and keep your old edition of Dog Soldiers. The Blu-ray version actually looks worse and there are none of the special features that are on the DVD edition. Way to rip us off Firstlook Studios.
2,"Big fan of the movie, horrible Blu Ray","I give it the 2 stars for McKidd and the film, as I like both - but nothing on here is worthy of Blu-Ray.Picture: Grainy, tons of artifact, darker than the original preservation, and just plain disappointing. Looks like they used the original transfer without ANY cleaning up. The night vision footage and wolf point of view are meant to look grainy, but I was hoping they would fix the rest. The creatures look decent depending on the scene, but the suits don't get that respect the makers deserved in Blu (no CGI).Sound: By far the worst ""True HD"" mix I have heard. Maybe a shell casing or two hit the outer channels, but everything got heavily mixed to the front speakers.Extras: None.Recommendation - Even with this low SRP it has nothing to ever make me watch this again at home or as a demo in the store."
5,Best Ever,This has to be the best werewolf movie ever made. The creatures are the best I've seen and the story is good. Best ever. And I've seen plenty of werewolf movies.
4,its scary,"I didnt watch this at night, a good thing, even though when i watched this in the morning i was still freaking out screaming when my phone rang! The movie feels like a lower budget one at the beginning, but as the action picks up , u dont care that its not a major hollywood production. The werewolves, start to run amock spilling everyones guts out. There are some funny parts, that u wanna laugh at , and get scare dover seconds later.The only weird thing was that the werewolves were too damn tall. They were like tall skinny giants! I got my moneys worth out of this rental. And i liek Cooper, because he sounded like arnold Schwarzenegger with his scottish/english accent. I kept thinking ""are they sure he isnt Austrian?"". over all gory and kind not something id watch alone in the dark."
3,Good but not great,"This is a good movie and I enjoyed viewing this movie, but answer this question before purchasing it. Are you going to buy this because you saw on the back of cover a quote from a critic saying this movie is the Dawn of the Dead of its time? If you are, then instead of buying this, go rent it first. From what I saw, Dawn of the Dead is way better than this movie. If that isn't the reason than go buy this because it is a good action-suspense movie with a giant twist at the end."
4,Night of the Evil Werewolves,"Effective action horror movie in which a group of English soldiers must battle a pack of werewolves to survive. ""Evil Dead"" meets "" Predator"" The film could have been tighter but if you like gory action- this one is for you."
5,british horror to the max,great movie about werewolves.good twists within movie.army guys with guns what more can you ask for.
2,Spindly wolves and lots of giblets,"Looking at some of the other reviews, I must be in the minority on this: I thought the movie was *very* weak. Rather than just saying that, I'll be fair and go over the pros and cons.Pros:* Lots of blood and gore.* Angry Scotsman.* The dog is cute.Cons:* Spindly ""werewolves"" (did a taxidermist have a yard sale?).* B-movie special effects and techniques.* Little-to-no plotline. I wasn't impressed.* ""Nighttime"" was exceedingly bright, even with a full moon.* The wolves ""night vision"" looked like they just colorized daylight. I've never seen night vision that looks like that.* They must've blown the entire budget for this film buying red food coloring, renting a house and blowing up vehicles. Oh, and pressing the DVDs."
2,This was not a good horror film,I am a big horror movie buff and I rented this movie seeing that it had alot of positive reviews....Excited I popped the movie in and was hugely disappointed. First off it's british which is okay I can deal with it but the movie turned out to be real talky ...I found alot of it was uneccesary...I can't really go into that much detail because this movie made me feel like I had A.D.D...My mind kept wandering off and it was hard to focus...It had some nasty scenes but really it was nothing new ...As a fan of horror films I would not recommend this it was really weak in my opinion... I did give it 2 stars for effort !!!
2,Crap,"A completely stupid movie. The start was great though, and thats what earnt it 2 stars. Very tense and scary when you hear the werewolves when they are closing in on the soldiers that are retreating after finding another unit slaughtered. But after that, its all downhill.The werewolves were the worst attempt at horror i have ever seen. They were more funny then anything. It just completely stuffed up all the good work done before it.What made the early stages good, was that the werewolves were blending into the shadows, and all you could hear was growling. but the fright factor vanishes once you see them.A terrible piece of poo! Dont waste your time on it!"
1,crap in a basket,Really really bad. Crappy twist. This movie was a total waste of time. I hate when a good premise is given over to camcorder weilding cheapskates trying to make a buck.
1,Mindless Junk,"This was the worst horror film I have ever seen. The lighting was horrible and the actors virtually impossible to understand. The camerawork was dizzying. The werewovles looked like what they were, men with fake wolves heads on them. Between the mumbling accents of the actors and the film looking like it was shot with no lighting at all, it was absolutely impossible to figure out what was going on.Don't waste your time or money."
5,been a long time....,"This is one great movie. I cant believe this never got a wide release in north america. We get garbage like American Werewolf in paris instead. Hurray. Pfffft. Oh well. This movie brings werewolves back from the fringes.We have some english soldiers on a training mission in the highlands of scottland. They are there to skirmish with some special ops guys. Its not long before the grunts find the remains of the special ops camp. The body parts scattered about are enough to get the squad to give up their training mission and get out of the woods. Of course, its too late. A local pack of werewolves are doing some hunting of their own.The troops shack up in an abandoned house and fight as wave after wave of attacks begins. Is this one enemy these troops can't defeat? You will have to watch and find out.a great transfer. clean, crisp and colorfull. a must have."
4,dog soldiers,"the film was brillaint- there was some great acting.(kevin mckidd,sean pertwee, liam cunningham,,and Emma Cleasby along with an unknown cast) The film follows a squad of six soldiers across the scottish hilands but their expodition turns into a nightmare when they realise that they're being tracked by a pack of werewolves. They seek refuge in a deserted farm house- Out numbered and surrounded the squad fight for survival with the help of megan, a zoologist in the neighbouring glen. Hoping and preying they'll last the night they work to fend off their monstrous enimies..."
4,Dog soldiers,"Good action movie. I rented it just because it looked like it would be entertaining to make fun of but it actually was pretty well made. The acting and production were much better than I expected and I ended up buying on BluRay to add to my movie collection. If you liked Predator, and action/Horror, I recommend."
1,for people who find running with scissors entertaining,Annoying film about buggered up East Coasters unleashing their ids. Jarring disfunction-junction setting that wants to be sick and cute all at once.
2,Like a car crash....,"You want to turn away but you just can't stop watching! Like other reviewers suggest, maybe I need to read the book. The film on it's own holds the audience attention by bouncing from one obscure situation to another while remaining emotionally vacant. Some admirable performances by a suprisingly well known and talented cast. Definately one for those who prefer something from the 'art house' movie genre."
3,Could be better,"It must have been quite difficult to translate such a complex story into a +/- 120 minute movie. The actors (some of them were popular actors of the 80's) however, gave a better-than-usual performances. I found scenes between John and Frannie as a bit disturbing, I wonder if this was caused by the difficulties of transposing words and prose into ""scenes""."
4,What does it mean?,"A previous review lamented the fact that a lot was left unexplained in the film (why did they end up in Vienna??), I read the book before seeing the film and perhaps because I knew the background detail I was able to subliminally enjoy it more. I now realise that the questions the reviewer asks did not even occur to me, as I already knew the answers. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book beforehand my rating would be a 2 instead of a 4.I did however and found it thought provoking and disturbing just as I did the book!"
2,not so good,"I absolutely loved the John Irving book that this was based upon. Very quirky (especially for it's time), hilariously funny, and the characters he created were magnificent. In my opinion however, the movie was uninteresting and only mildly funny. Not many movies do justice to the books they've been based upon, for many reasons. This is no excuse for Hotel New Hampshire however. Irving's ""World according to Garp"" was a superb book (similar in length and complexity to Hotel NH), and was made into a very good movie. I'd recommend checking out that one instead if you want to see a John Irving novel of this period on film."
1,D-Movie,Even one star is way too much for this whole load of crap. Idiotic plot meets abyssmal directing and acting. One of the sickest film productions I have ever been exposed to.
1,Garp Lite,"I loved the book and the film of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP when they first came out. Then I read THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE. I thought it was horrible. When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).No. THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky. I never believed them. They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them. Stylistically, it's just confusing. When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for. Slapstick incest?I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over."
4,"State of grace, State of Maine, State of mind","I wanted to comment a bit further on slickinafix's remarks that you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. The book takes you down several different paths that the movie doesn't go-but watching the movie gives you more feelings for the characters, their passions and discoveries than the book can. Especially in the case of Win, the father and his father, Iowa Bob, the original owner of the family bear, State of Maine-there are things done in the movie that can't really be visualised in the book. Also, the Hotel Manager is more visually interesting. The Hotel New Hampshire is the only John Irving book or movie that I have read or seen, alhtough I am very much looking forward to The Cider House Rules.The book left me with a slight feeling of despair-though I saw the movie twenty years ago, it gave me more of a feeling of hope for the Berry's, in a somewhat Scarlett O'Hara, ""I'll think about that tomorrow"" fashion."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star,I wish I didn't have to give this movie any star. The girl in the bear suit was weird. What was wrong with these people? I would rather watch Black Swan (which I totally hated) again. If you watch this you'll be sorry.
1,Fake Alert,"A third rate street song selection, and a lame performance to match.My family is from Odessa, and this ain't Odessa Jewish music."
4,Quick and witty read,Very short stories but doesn't miss out on the quirky and witty exchanges between Holmes and Watson. Could've had a bit more elaborate versions. Good collection of cases.
4,Great Sherlock Holmes classic,Very well written and easy to read. The short story format makes it convenient to read a complete story in one session.
2,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"I would obviously give this product five stars--all things Sherlock Holmes are awesome--but I specifically bought this to download the audiobook for a car trip, and was unable to do so, although I repeatedly tried to follow the download instructions. Sad, silent, long car trip for me."
1,Poor quality,"This stethoscope is terrible quality. The diaphragm is flimsy, the head is loose, rattles when you move it and would obscure sounds. The unit is very heavy compared to other units."
3,Close to a Littmann for cheap,"I am a firefighter/paramedic in a major US city, I was in need of a stethescope that was cheap and worked great. I bought this in hopes that it was just as great as a littmann cardiology, it's close. The sound quality is about 80% to a littmann, but the design and build quality are not. The diaphragms are always falling off and the bell housing seems to sometimes spin freely. Delphi did send me a new diaphragm, but it was a Littmann, works bettter now."
3,Great--if you're a professional baker!,"Nancy Silverton sure doesn't like anything--she hates pumpkin pie and Rice Krispie squares--and most Americans who don't have access to her pricey bakery. Considering she just sold her baking enterprise for 55 million to an overseas conglomerate, this cook-book is only a small piece of a sideline.This book is very fun to read but it's very hard to follow the recipes if you're not a very experienced baker with a raft of equipment. Pity the poor bride who gets this as a wedding gift!Rose Levy Birnbaum's Cake Bible and Pie and Pastry Bible are much more detailed, with clear directions that walk the novice baker through the steps.If you're a big-time foodie, this book is no doubt a must, but since most foodies aren't going to actually cook from their prized volumes, the caveats about the receipes won't matter. If you actually want to learn to bakr, I'd look elsewhere."
1,The best pastry chef and baker?,"I want be available to tell you, this book is so boringHardly any pictures none in colour I don't no how the product suppose to look like lengthy explanation who do not make you feel like baking or even in appetite I am a pastry chef mi self and own a large collection of cooking book from Women Weekly to highly sophisticated professionals one, this one will have to be the worst one"
3,A Great Cookbook that deserved a Great Editor,"This would have been a delightful cookbook, but the careful eye of an editor was needed. None of the recipes I have used have been free of errors. By way of example, the author indicates that the recipe for the yummy Banana-Cocoa Muffins yields 12 muffins. Actually, there is sufficient batter for 30 good-sized muffins - but only enough garnish for 12! If followed carefully, the recipe for cannele - which should produce tender little French cakes - produces rock-hard pellets. Most of the time, an accomplished cook can work with the many many mistakes - a novice will have a great deal of trouble using this book."
2,Grrr,"I was so excited to get this book and have been really disappointed with it. First off, a lot of these recipes call for special equipment like cake rings, flan molds, etc. And not just one of these items, but several for one recipe. Even through wholesale supply stores, the cost to make one of her recipes is ridiculous. Secondly, the flavors are meh. I made her cake donuts as well as her pretty pear cookies and found both to be bland and tasteless. I threw away both, and those pear cookies took hours just in prep work. Also, with the exception of a few ""antiqued"" ones, there are no pictures. Most of the time, I don't really need pictures to follow a recipe, but some of her instructions are unclear and a picture of what the final product is supposed to look like would be helpful."
5,Before its time,"If you've ever seen Mystery Science Theatre or you just like to make up your own dialogue to old movies: This is where it all started. Woody Allen and a group of actors redid the voices for a Hong Kong action movie, and it's hilarious. Now, it's all about the quest for the secret Egg Salad recipe!"
1,AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS,"Beware : this is an edited version of What's Up Tiger Lily. Some of the dialogue has been changed or erased, resulting in a far less funny movie than it originally was. I have no idea who is responsible for the butchering of this film - whether Woody authorized it or not - but it is not the movie I have seen 10+ times."
3,For Woody enthusiasts,Early Woody. Okay. 'Nuff said. I bought it for a friend who needs to own every W A film. He's very happy so there.
5,"WHAT TOOK SO LONG, TIGER LILY?","Well, it only took about 40 years or so to get the godfather of Mystery Science Theater on to DVD - and guess what - it's still so good you'll plotz!"
3,What have they done to it?,"In my early twenties I must have watched this movie with my friends at least thirty times - often enough that we could recite every word of it from memory years later. Twenty years on I decided to revisit it when a friend told me it was now available on DVD. To my horror, I discovered that huge swathes of the dialogue have been changed for no apparent reason and, sadly, not for the better. What was a very funny script at one time has been tainted by passages of mediocre and not very funny dialogue. Some classic moments remain but, as a whole, it is a real let down. If the original version still exists in some shape or form I would urge those of you who, like me, were disappointed to give it another chance - it really is worth it."
2,Not a great movie,"My co-workers recommended this movie saying how great and funny it was, but it fell short of the hype. It fell WAY short - even if they hadn't hyped it up. The whole theme and dialog is very uncohesively slapped together, and the comedy is far from clever, or even funny. Over the course of the whole movie, I probably only laughed 3-4 times."
2,Might of been funny then....,"Back in 1966, when no one had done anything like this it was probably hysterical! But any one episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, no matter which one, is at least three times as funny as this. At least in my opinion. This movie has a few funny moments, but I am glad I saw this as a rental and not a purchase."
3,"a wilted, faded flower...","Grafting new dialog onto an existing movie wasn't new when Woody Allen did it to an inept Japanese spy thriller. Jay Ward had already done it with ""Fractured Flickers."" Firesign Theater trashed Saturday-matinee serials in ""Hot Shorts."" And Spike network's ""MXC"" twists and tweaks a goofy Japanese game show.""Tiger Lily"" is showing her age -- what was novel 30 years ago no longer is. We've seen better movie send-ups (""Airplane!"", MST3K). And Woody chose a film that doesn't have enough dialog to smother with jokes, so we're too-often stuck with watching a boring, derivative film.Not in any way bad (there are a few great lines), but not funny enough to watch more than once or twice."
2,Woody Allen's admitted embarrasment,"C'mon, be honest, fellow reviewers! You all know Woody Allen hated the result of this his first movie project! Don't tell me you really think it's a quality movie!In fact, the best thing you can say about What's Up, Tiger Lily? is that it is an interesting experiment: putting newly-written english words to an already recorded awful Japanese action movie. The other good thing are the approx. two minutes in which Woody Allens appears, and the gorgeous 1960's-style Japanese girls.There's no story; a few very funny (or rather: far out) laughs, mostly because of the extremely poor, nearly parodistic quality of the Japanese movie; and that's about it.An experience rather than an enjoyable quality movie."
1,"""She's a personal friend of James Bond!!!!""","I cannot believe that this was released and What's New, Pussycat was not.This is way past the point of being deranged.I can't believe that anyone would believe Tiger Lily would have more commercial potential than Pussycat. Of course, Image Entertainment released Tiger Lily so they have the video rights, whie Pussycat was released on VHS only by MGM/UA so MGM must have the video rights. Therefore, this is not really an apt comparison. However, I never miss a chance to kvetch about the appalling dearth of good films that remain unreleased in the U.S.The chat rooms being, as near as I can determine, useless I would like to engage in discussions with some people who also list films that should be on DVD. Maybe we could instigate letter writing campaigns. I was amazed at how many lists included A Fine Madness and The Offence. Anyone interested may feel free to email me. eMail address in on my Amazon page."
5,mythical erections,"Architects these days just build things, and they don't even get to be very famous. There used to be architect-gurus back in the twentieth century, who said things that got quoted a lot - people like Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier. Kelly Howell is the daughter of one of these architect-philosophers, who was famous for not having built anything until he got crushed by one of his creations (a concrete hand).. She is conflicted about her feelings for her parents, makes a living driving a cab, and keeps trying to avoid giving interviews to biographers. A persistent American admirer of her father inveigles his way into her life.It's mostly set in rural Norfolk, England. It is brilliantly satirical but also very cleverly plotted, especially in the last few chapters (set in California) that twist and turn and set the story on its head."
3,f&t,Nice stories.2&3 year olds not entertained need more pics. 5 year old likes the stories. Pages are thin and tear easily.
1,Good book for kids.,I aways say the frog and todd should stay in your heart until you have children. This is a great book for kids 5-8 yrs. old.
5,Help a child learn to read,The Frog and Toad books have helped my 8 year old grandson learn to read--he has been having trouble and these books were so interesting and fun to him that he finally realized how reading could open up whole new worlds for him. He loves these books.
5,Frog and Toad,The book is perfect for my 6 year old. She had to read it for school..and we truly enjoy the Frog and Toad books. The seller sent it in a timely fashion and it was in excellent condition :)
4,Great for Early Readers,"Listening to and reading at the same time - 'bi-modal' approach to learning - is a great tool to encourage and support early readers. And, you can take the CDs in the car which beats listening to Radio Disney any day!"
5,Frog and toad,"I really enjoy this book. It did have a name written on the corner of the cover in permanent marker I wished I knew about, but I was able to get it off."
4,Don't understand the hate!,"I just watched this last night, and to be frank I don't understand the hate. I felt that Kevin Kline is a hilarious character in this film, he lights up the screen every chance he can get. He did great in this. Paul Dano is also one of my favorite actors, and I thought he did great as well. The supporting characters like John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes did great as well. I found it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it again. I would highly recommend it."
3,It's all about eccentricity,It's all about eccentricity. But eccentricity played mostly for charm and amusement by actors who accomplish this sort of thing well. It's a fun trifle.
4,Delicously eccentric.,"Stars Paul Dano as a socially awkward, meek idealist who tries to discover his identity. He rents a room from Kevin Kline's character, a miserly (failed) playwright with a stifling ego who charms older women. Comedy ensues as Louis (Dano) falls for a coworker (Holmes) at his 9-5 job, and Kline takes him under his wing. John C. Reilly makes a cameo as a silent, mysterious neighbor.If you enjoy quirky, light-hearted films, add this to your watch list. If you demand redemption, higher purpose, or a 'point' from all your cinema, let me save you the trouble--don't bother watching."
4,I can't help but see a touch of 'Harold and Maude' here.,"Paul Dano has in my opinion a Bud Cort ala 'Harold and Maude' presentation of his character going on in this film. And the fact that he has romantic (though strictly platonic and to a much lesser extent in this case) feelings for a much older woman, to a small extent also brings to mind H&M to me. I don't feel it quite reaches H&M's level of sustained quirkiness, but it does have enough to place it in the same 'quirky film genre' if you will. Had EM had a prominent soundtrack to the film, I think it would have been a plus, as H&M's Cat Stevens songs are a perfect addition to it's production! Maybe some Sufjan Stevens? The movie is very good, not great. Be prepared for something a little different. If you've seen 'Harold and Maude' and liked that film, I think that very possibly you could appreciate the statements made within this picture. Enjoy."
3,HAPPY BISSEXTILE DAY,"Louis Ives (Paul Dano) has a fascination with women's undergarments, and on occasion likes to wear them. This issue causes him to leave his teaching job and go to New York where he gets a job with an environmental magazine where he develops an interest for vegan Katie Holmes. Meanwhile, Louis takes up residence with the extremely quirky Henry Harrison (Kevin Kline) who enlists Louis to be an ""extra man"" i.e. a non-sexual cultured escort for older women of wealth. The job doesn't pay, but you do get to meet rich people and go to expensive places.The part of being the escort I found entertaining, more so then the cross dress fetish. I expected Louis to have gotten ""introduced"" awkwardly to Katie Holmes on one of his assignments, but such was not the case. The writers tried to be too cute and clever by introducing too many different themes...i.e. let's toss it at the wall and see what stick. If you like indie films, worth a view.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity"
2,P U - this movie stinks,"If you enjoy watching people be odd just for the sake of it - then you might enjoy this, otherwise keep looking for another movie to watch.Good cast - worthless story.Kline plays a prudish bachelor of almost no income, living in a total dump and having fleas - yet he acts like someone with money and sucks up to a wealthy old lady to be included in upper society occasionally. Paul Dano plays an extremely timid loser who rents a cot in Kline's crappy residence. He experiments with cross dressing and has a little crush on Katie Holmes (which goes nowhere). John C Reilly plays a nice but wild and intimidating looking man with a cartoon character type voice. There really isn't any plot to this story - or any story to this story. Just some odd characters who really aren't interesting at all - especially Dano."
2,Not Worth It,"No narrative. No background. Just a gory slideshow with some that cliche, whiny, graveyard music. Yes, while the pictures were gory and all, it was, for the most part, boring as HELL. And if you're a true gore hound like me, than you've already seen most of the pictures around the internet and stuff anywyas. A big yawn. Stick with Death Scenes or Traces of Death."
3,Good story but slow at times.,Overall I truly enjoyed this book. There were some spots where I felt the writer spent to much describing unnecessary scene detail. I touched it through those areas and made it to the end.
3,It was O.K,I have read many of Zane Grey's books. And I have enjoyed everyone. My own personal opinion on this one and it is prejudiced because I love animals. I did not like the ending.I do not want to spoil the book for anyone else but those who have read it might understand my review. It just did not have to end that way!!!
4,When Horses Ran Wild,"What Jack London did for dogs in Call of the Wild, Zane Grey did for horses in Wildfire. This is indeed the story of a magnificent wild stallion, his capture, his love for a girl, and his race against odds so large, only Zane Grey could imagine and put on paper. The geographic region ZG describes is known today as Monument Valley and you can see his love and his realness in his description; and if you've ever been there, which I have, you can see Wildfire running again in your mind's eye among the turrets, and the shattered upheaval of rock. Also, in the story is how the two main characters Lin Sloan and Lucy Bostil fall in love with the horse's help, of course; and the horse thief who wants to steal this magnificent animal. But the romance is secondary to the story of the horse. Read if for yourself, and see if I am right in my evaluation of this book."
5,"Wildfire, by Zane Grey",I really enjoyed reading this book again. Its been close to 60 years since I read it the first time. If you like westerns you should like this one.
1,One Of The Worst Horror Movies EVER!,"I'm one of the biggest Friday the 13th fans, but this was completely ridiculus. I went into the theater thinking, ""wow, I think this is going to be the best one yet"". After 45 minutes I left. Yes, the way Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) sliced up people was diffrent. But that doesnt make a horror movie. The aliens, the time travel, the rebuilding of a human body, its all pathedic. Well, this franchise should be fed to the dogs now. Considering I loved 'Jason Goes To Hell', which most people hated, then you must agree with me here. This sinks quicker then it starts! Avoid this and rent the original nine previous volumes of the Camp Crystal Lake horrors."
1,This Movie is not Horror.....it's.....HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"I downloaded this movie back in november, and let me tell you, this movie WAS NOT EVEN WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!!! Movie is stupid, the plot does not make any sense, but SOME of the action seens are ok. The Captin of the ship looks like Kevin Kelly from the WWF, While the kid that lives at the end falls in love with a robot head (getting weirder anyone?). Before the movie ends, Jason becomes ""ROBO JASON"" and he looks EXACTLY like Lord Zedd from Power Rangers. PLEASE...DON'T BLOW $10 BUCKS AT THE MOVIES TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!! FIND IT ON THE NET IF YOU MUST OR SIMPLY....SKIP IT!!!!!"
1,Not good at all,"It looked great on commercial, but when I rented it, it sucked. Basically it turned a horror film into a sci-fi with some stupidness."
3,FOR THE 9TH SEQUEL THIS IS REALLY NOT THAT BAD! A WORTHY ENTRY 2 1/2 STARS!,"I have to laugh, as I think how many times this guy has been killed! Or at least how many times people have attempted to kill him(Jason). This movie, if viewed with the right frame of mind is pretty entertaining!There is some humor in this series now more than in the first couple of installments. Ever since ""Jasons Lives"" there is almost a tougue and cheek approach to these films. ""Jason Lives"" is where I really started to notice the difference in these films.It is not that ""Jason Lives"" is the best Friday it is the first time I realized that Jason was here to stay! The James Bond homage in the beginning of that film says it all. ""Jason X"" is a welcome edition to the franchise after the awful ""Jason goes to Hell"".So sit back,take out you brain and LYFAO!"
2,A big dissapointment,"I liked most of the jason movies so i thought ""This looks like a good one"" So i got home popped it in and it started out great. Sort of scary and suspenceful and then ""Boom"" it went from good to bad. People from the future came unfroze jason and some girl. The worst part of the movie is when Jason gets a new mask. It completley ruins him he goes from scary to retarded. Bringing the movie to the future ruined it for me."
1,bad never been so bad,This is so bad it's astounding! What were the filmmakers thinking? They should all be lined up and slapped! Nothing in this makes any sense. Jason X is the worst movie I will ever see! This deserves a negative 5........notice the music .. sounds like a 12 year old on a radio shack keyboard.. everything about this movie sucks
1,This Movie is a disgrace to the Jason legacy,"What kind of Mickey Mouse, PG rated,MTV real world, sci fi mini-series is this. This is no way compares to the other jason films. Infact is stains the Jason legacy. this movie is stupid and not worth watching. The film makes put no effort in making outer space or the space ship and the actors are stupid and can't act period. The space ship and looks extremely fake like somethin off a mini-series. The only good part in the film was when jason's body turned into all metal and that's at the end of the movie (go figure). I mean i could have made a better movie than this with a home video camra.The actors on this movie look like they were MTV real world. this film is completely [weak] and should have never been made. this crapy film makes jason look [weak] to me. [...]"
1,DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!,I have so far thought that the Friday the 13th series has been alright. But this movie was terrible. It is absolutly unwatchable unless you are a huge fan. The movie takes place in space and Jason gets unthawed thats all the more proof you need not to see this movie. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and the acting is terrible. There are only two cool death scenes in the whole movie and thats it. DON'T see this movie.
1,One Star is even too much!,"How anyone can give this biggest piece of c%$p movie any stars is beyond me! Even a die hard Friday the 13th fan could not possibly find anything about this movie that makes it remotely good. How any movie studio ever even approved a budget for this movie I will never know. Wait for it to come out on TV, and even than you may want to consider watching something else."
5,its called entertainment,"saw this in theatre. i rate this as the second ""best"" movie i've seen in the past couple years. (triple xxx being #1 and ghost of mars #3...its that kind of ""best"" movie =) jason is just a bad [man]. i mean how many people do you know that can chop a guys arm off when frozen. HOW MANY. Watch it with friends. You'll laugh. Might not be something you'd want to buy unless your really into the series."
3,Jason X,Jason X was okay. It was good but could have been much better! I thought Lexa Doig was pretty! But on the other hand it was kind of stupid!
4,Awesome!,"I thought this movie was awesome. I am a major Jason fan and waited for this movie for months when I discovered it existed. I was excited but prepared for disappointment, the whole idea of Jason in space wasn't all that appealing. I only have one big problem with this movie. In Jason Goes To Hell, Jason well duh goes to hell, so I was hoping for some sort of explanation to him no longer being in hell, how did he get out of hell? No explanation at all. He just ends up being chained up at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Ignoring that, I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think any Jason fans will be disappointed, that is, if they are a true Jason fan. Its not the first time the Jason movies left holes and certainly not the only horror movies to do so. As for Jason in space, well, it will make total sense if you watch the movie, so sit back, enjoy, and go see Jason X!! I look forward to its release to video and DVD."
2,Let Jason die - please!!,"First off, I have toadmit, I was dragged to this movie. But once I settled into my seat, I was ready for a good scare. Halfway into the movie I was still waiting. The sript and the acting were the stuff of straight-to-video. The moive starts out with an interesting concept and a very cool visual style - but once we get Jason unfrozen on the ship, it all goes to hell. Lets' see - in outer space with an android, a strong female lead, a man whose main focus is money and a creature hell-bent on killing everyone. Sounds familiar? Belive me, the formula worked much better in Alien than it does here. Save your money - if you really need to see this, it should be on video and dvd next month."
2,I found this film VERY stimulating,"This film was very sensuous the atrocious acting was very seductive and the marvellous storyline made me weep with delight.Oh how i laughed, when i watched this film at the cinema. I found it to be extremely entertaining, so i have compiled a selection of my favourite scenes:-When two campgirls try to seduce Jason but end up being beaten simultaneously against a tree (you should have heard their seductive speech, ""let's smoke pot"" (in a deep unattractive russian accent). The next cool scene was when Lisa Ryder (women with a black Mop hairdo) tried to perform really bad martial arts but had her head slapped off,(i was hoping she would die, but she was still alive despite her head rolling along the floor like a cabbage). The beggining of the film was very misleading as it was actually quite good, but you should persevere through the entire movie, cos i guarantee it will put a smile on your face (if only in disgust)"
1,Worst movie in the series by far,"Jason is frozen in 2010 in Crystal Lake Research Facility. In 2455, He's thawed out on a space ship and he kills away through the crew on the ship soon thereafter. Didn't something like this go down with Leprechaun [Anyone recall Leprechaun 4]? It was terrible when they tryed to send Leprechaun into space and it was even worse when they tryed to send Jason into space! This is by far the lowest point in the series. This series should've ended years ago, But filmmakers saw that they could make a lotta money producing sequels to these movies so, The series continued and continued and the inevitable result of that is movies like this. If you wanna see a Jason movie that bad, Go rent Friday The 13th part 3 or 6. Followed by the spin-off Freddy Vs. Jason"
2,What was that behind us?,"This movie can easily compete for the cheesiest plot in movie history. It has a story of a low-budget Showtime softcore flick, combined with a spectacular quality of production. In terms of stagecraft, the movie has some of the best set designs... ever. What I kept thinking was: with a storyline this horrible (or lack thereof), who paid for this? Ultimately, the movie is a waste of time, and it is certainly not a serious horror film. It actually feels like a satire, with sexy female science students dissecting stuff while waring outfits too racy for a New York City nightclub. Basically, it is watchable, but one has got to see the farce of it, or I would start worrying about that IQ level.Half a star for actually making the movie, half a star more for great set designs, and a whole new star for nice college girls getting sliced up, amongst other things..."
1,Yuck!,Horrible! Jason in space come on! Jason is frozen and is taken to space where the ship becomes a bloodbath.
1,Good beginning but not enough to make it a good one !,"The opening is great and the beginning is interesting but quickly it becomes a joke. It's Jason meets Terminator in the Star Trek world ! From bad to worse. Great SFX though but the story is simply ridiculous. The last scene is a masterpiece in the STUPID genre but well, what can you expect by putting Jason in the space ! Good documentary in the special features about the friday the 13 th serie ;) Finally better than the whole movie."
2,Could be alot better.,"This movie is really a movie that you can only see once and say ""we'll it wasn't bad"". The movie could have been alot better, it takes to long for jason to get his up-grade, leaving the audience waiting with boredom. And one thing that really got to me is that Jason has a different hockey mask this time around, i liked the old hockey mask better. If theres a sequel and it's set at camp crystal lake it should be pretty good, but all the orginal ""friday the 13th"" movies were better than this.Maybe if this movie wasn't set aboard a space ship it would have been better.To improve this movie they should have made Jason get an up-grade quicker and half-way through they should end up at camp crystal lake.So if you're going to by this movie,don't. Just go and rent it out.If you do make the mistake of bying then you'll watch it once and never lay eyes upon it again."
2,Jason should disown this one.,The only reason this film gets two stars is for the idea and the upgrade (as short lived as it is). Sean Cunningham needs to take the Friday the 13th series back to the basics. I enjoyed the idea of Futeristic Jason and I really liked his new look although it seemed such a waste to do it for the last 10 minutes of the movie. As for the acting and awesomely bad dialog not to mention the Alien franchise rip offs (ex.. Jason wasting well trained grunts while people listen in. Remeber Bill paxton in Aliens? Game over man. And remember Alien Resurection when the Hybrid Alien gets sucked out of a hole in the ship? Even with it's many shortfalls there are some decent death scenes to enjoy.Only for true Jason fans. If you're looking for a horror movie to snuggle up with your counterpart on the couch with check out 28 Days later or even Underworld. Otherwise you're wasting your money.
2,Why?,"They killed Jason Voorhees in ""Jason Goes To Hell"". Don't they know when to end a trilogy? Many of them tend to go downhill very fast when they decide to ressurrect a killer. This is no exception. They did not get anything right versus how they ended Part 9. All this movie is, for the most part, is Jason slashing people in a space craft. Nothing else fits: the storyline, the effects, etc."
3,"Jason in space, whats next? Jason versus Aliens?!","- Jason X is a typically lets-take-this-franchise-into-space movie (Like Hellraiser: Bloodline and Critters 4). Tough, i found this movie better than the last ""space-horrors""... Course it comes NO WHERE NEAR the original... =) Tough good music, good special effects, and the UberJason (!), i'll have to give this movie a 3 stars... Some actors were a bit dull, and the storyline was really bad. But, its a good popcorn movie..."
2,"Not bad, but far from the greatest ""Friday"" movie.","I am another person who is half and half on this film. The general idea of this movie is okay, but the feel of a Friday the 13th movie just isn't here. The older movies, although most of them share a plot, are gobs more suspenseful and fun than this. From the first moment on, everyone knows that Jason is the killer. How much fun is that? Also, that female robot on the movie is just soooo cheesy. There is no place for that kind of humor on a Jason film. Jason.. go back to the lake and get us another halfway decent sequel! Please! Go back to the lake!"
4,wicked awsome,"Jason X is the 10th and hopefully not the last in the Friday the 13th series starring everyones favorite serial killer,Jason.This lastest installment features the hockey masked madman in space.I was disappointed when I first heard that he would be in space and not slicing and dicing in his home of Camp Crystal lake.But after seeing the movie in theaters,I was not disappointed.This movie was wicked awsome.Jason kicks major [rear] in this film.We get gore and nudity and everything else.The only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of star Lexa Doig.She's one hot babe but she doesn't show off those melons of hers.We get to see her impressive cleaveage but not full frontal.Why?"
2,Not Impressed.,"As a Jason fan I think this one is a bad movie. It doesn't follow the storyline the other 1-9 had. I thought this one was Freddy vs. Jason but it wasn't to find out that comes out next year June 13, 2003. This movie is going to stick out from the rest of the series because it doesn't fit. I don't recommend this because it isn't my favorite but if you are a fan you have to have this movie no matter what."
1,AWFUL!,"Okay, I am a huge horror fan, and a fan of the Friday The 13th series, but this has got to be the worst one to date. I should have known as soon as I read ""Jason in space"", but since I am a loyal fan of the series, I gave it a chance. Everything about this movie, especially the plot was awful, and the acting wasn't much better. The ending was horrible, as I expected. The only good thing about this movie was Jason's killing style, he is back and meaner than ever, no mercy, by far in my opinion he's done his worst killing in this movie. If you have all the other Friday the 13th movies, you probably want to add this to the collection. I just have to wait for Freddy vs. Jason."
1,Has the whole world gone mad?,"An average customer review of almost 4 stars? Have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia? Jason supposedly went to hell yeah? Then why is still in one piece. This time round, the government realise there's nothing they can do to stop Jason and have him captured. He is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm. Unfortunatley, he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space! Yes space! The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good. There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it's just not enough! This sequel sounds more like a Star Trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good Friday the 13th flick. Supposedly, a TWELFTH Friday the 13th movie is being made (if you count the excellent Freddy Vs Jason). While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive, there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore."
1,Str8 Garbage,"FOR 1 THING THE JASON MOVIES ARE OVER-RATED. THE ONLY ONE I LIKE WAS JASON GOES TO HELL.FREDDY VS JASON WAS EVEN BETTER.JASON X WAS THE MOST BORING,THE MOST GARBAGE MOVIE I EVER SEEN. JASON MOVIES ARE ALL THE SAME HE KILS FOR ABOUT 3 SECS THEN CHASES AT THE END.GARBAGE!!!!!! BESIDES THERE ALL THE SAME HE CHASES TEENAGERS.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME BESIDES THE MOVIE GOT 1/4 STARS OVERALL."
4,What will they think of next?,"I personally hav not seen all of the the Friday the 13th movies but I have seen the first one and thought it was pretty good. Jason X starts off at Camp Crystal Lake were jason is waiting to be transported by the army. At it again jason begins knocking off the cast one by one, in a spectacular fashion. The one and only female to make it some how manages to get jason frozen and in the process getting stabbed and frozen to. A group of young kids stumble apon jason and the young female in the year 2455! As they bring the young female to life. Jason goes to work killing everyone in his path. It's really a good movie all of the way through and a good ending. I would reccomend this film to anybody a fan of the series. I can't wait to see Jason VS Freddy coming out this summer."
2,"Im a fan of the series, but not of this film","I have been a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, for as long as I can remember. I always enjoyed the films and even though they had no budget and sub-par acting at best they have alwasy been entertaining to sit through. That was at least until part 8. But when New Line Cinema took over the series, they ruruned it. Jason goes to Hell was the worst movies in the series (a plot would have help), and Jason X isn't far behind. I like most people waited 9 years to see this film, and I was very dissipointed. There was barely any plot, at least the others had character devolopment. Buy to complete a set, not to enjoy."
3,Best enjoyed by Jason fans.,"This is a good movie that has a small plot to it. However, while interesting and a bit exciting at first, I would say that it leaves a bit to wish for; it's enjoyable to watch, but unless you already love the Friday 13th series as much as I did as a kid, it just might not cut it."
4,Yup :-),"Apart from the nicked 'aliens' grunt theme in there its actually top notch + a great addition to the Friday the 13th movies. It is a right laugh + there is only 1 top rate actor that played Jason + he's performing Top rate in this, I.E Kane hodder. Evil does get a well deserved upgrade indeed :-)"
3,IN SPACE NO ONE WEARS HOCKEY MASKS,"In the long, tired Jason series, you have to admit putting him into space was a risk...and for the most part, it works. The special effex are very well done, and the use of holograms is neat and different. It just seems that they haven't improved much in the casting department; most of the victims were people we never got to know, so their deaths were rather meaningless. Lisa Ryder as the android was lively and an asset to the cast; David Cronenberg's cameo is effective. Jonathan Potts as Professor Lowe was too hammy without ever being threatening, as Paul Reiser was in Aliens. They needed somebody like Bruce Dern or Bill Paxton. Anyway, there's little new in this movie, Jason runs around killing people and the end has two or three climaxes. Jason has been fun for about eleven or twelve movies now; let's put him to rest and find a new kind of horror."
2,Completely Hopeless!!!,"This could possibly be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!Jason Voorees and a young women are frozen in time and then in the very far away future a small group of researchers find them on earth which has been completely abandoned due to contaminated seas and toxic air. The researchers take Jason and the young women to their space craft where they both wake up! Of course from there it's pretty predictable. Jason slaughters everyone on the ship . . . blah, blah, blahThe beginning of this movie is just SO wrong!!! Did the director even watch Friday The 13th : Jason Goes To Hell? How did Jason become chained up in some kind of Crystal Lake Secret Facility? The ending of the film is semi-decent. It leaves the door open for another movie and if there is another one lets hope it's sain!!! Freddy vs Jason made a very good decision and acted like this movie never happened! My opinion . . . DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
5,"""Why does everyone hate this...?!""","I finally saw it, and I thought it was really good. Uber-Jason was extremely cool, but as silent as a rock, as always. There were some funny parts, but I didn't think the movie was mostly funny like everyone is saying. It was, however, extremely gory, and the scene where Uber-Jason was in the virtual replica of Camp Crystal lake and he wrapped one of the teen girls up and beat one of the others with her was pretty funny. The ending left it open for yet another sequel, and you wonder what Jason's modified face looks like, considering that Kay-Em 14 blew most of it off in the movie while he was still regular Jason. All in all, Jason X was a really good movie and I definately recommend it!"
4,Jason X,"Jason is back! This time he is slashing his way around a doomed spaceship... Wow! It's Event Horizon meets Friday The 13th with a little of Aliens mixed in... The future setting for the film makes me wonder if we will ever see that Freddy Vs Jason battle New Line has been promising for years. Obviously Jason X seems to be set long after that.. but who knows? If Freddy and Jason met in hell prior to this film it seems that Jason was the victor. but it still could go either way. This movie is a great additon to the existing Friday the 13th series of films, it is also the most unique."
4,I have seen the movie,"the movie is a lot better then what i had expected. if your looking for scares then you may not like this movie too much. its definitely not that freaky but it has great elements to it. i was thinking that this might be along the lines of leprechaun 4-in space (i promised my self i would never use the two words leprechaun and space in the same sentenece again), but it was 1000x better than that, which was one of the worst horror movies ever made. if your a fan of jason, see the movie, its worth the admission price. you may or may not like the ending though. it starts off fast paced"
1,Dreadful,"I usually try to be fair with reviews, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. In a movie series with basically no point, this one takes pointlessness to extremes.I generally enjoy horror movies--even stupid ones--but this is completely empty.It's a huge budget failure:The action is boring as hell, even when a dumb cyborg character is kicking the crap out of Jason. Jason's new look was completely dull, cheesy and unconvincing. Hell, it doesn't even add a new level of horror, or of amusment. At least a B-movie can get a few laughs and enjoyment for the cheese factor, but not Jason X. The story is annoying, let alone dumb, and was obviously just an attempt to cash in on folks who can't smell a fraud.Jason certainly did go to hell, and he took me with him on this one."
1,Very Possibly the Worst Movie Ever!,"I usually don't like the F13 movies, but i HATED this one. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.I highly recommend watching the Halloween series instead....the Halloween sequels (especially H4) are the best around."
1,0 STARS: JUST AWFUL TRASH!!! DO NOT WATCH THIS DIAHRHEA OF A HORROR MOVIE.,"Well, I guess Jason has killed everyone on Earth and, now, he is reduced to searching for his prey in space! In all seriousness, there is just something about Jason Voorhees in outer space that just strikes me as absolutely RETARDED!! With the Crystal Lake and Friday the 13th theme totally out the window, ""Jason X"" takes place in outerspace with Jason doing his killing on a space ship or space station, whatever that stupid thing was. This is simply rotten garbage from a horror movie fan's perspective. In fact, as far as I am concerned, Friday the 13th ended with Friday the 13th Part VI which is actually a pretty good horror movie. Everything after part VI is rubbish."
2,Not a good movie at all,"What was the point of taking this to outer space? You know,I had heard that this was a bad movie before I even rentedit... But Sheesh!!! There was less than a handful of decentmoments in the entire movie. It's starts off kind of coolfor about the first 10-15 minutes then it's all downhillfrom there. There is a few inventive killings... But besidesthat this movie is just like a cheep parody of the serieslike some of those parody late 80's movies that came outlike ""Return of the Living Dead"" or ""Killer Klowns FromOuter Space"" but those were funny and this is just 90%dull and boring.Pass on this if you are smart!"
2,this movie is a joke,"hahahahahahahah is this a jason movie????it sucks like crazy. it was more laughable than scary. i was not scared for a moment. the whole movie is bad except the beggining where he is original. the rest of the movie sucks because ....JASON DOESNT WORK IN THE FUTURE!!! what is up with the future mask it killed the movie. its not scary its actually pretty funny, the mask is weird, the story is stupid, the enviroment around u in the movie actually light up the place not giving that in the dark feeling. only good thing is beggining,some kills are good, and he kills a lot of people. i dont reccomend this movie."
5,Entertainment at its Best,"This movie was made for Jason fans and does a remarkable job. It is not for everyone. I think if you have a bad opinion of this movie, I'm not sure what you were doing in the theater in the first place. When you walk into a movie such as this, you expect blood, over-sexed teenagers getting slashed, and cheese. Jason X totally delivers.Also - major Kudos to the director. The pace of the movie was handled extremely well. There was never a dull moment and it was actually much more suspenseful than I expected. This movie ended with me wanting more, where Spiderman had me thinking, ""Ok - is this about over yet?""I know I may have lost all credibilty with that last line, but its how I feel."
2,What a waste,"This movie is sooo not worth buying, my suggestion is that you rent it only if your a harcore fan."
2,Whatever.,"Jason, the unstoppable mutant vengance demon, or whatever the heck he is, gets cryogenically frozen and thawed out in the 25th-Century, ""Alien""-y future, where he, like, totally gets to up the body count by, like, millions and bazillions of witless future-people. If you're willing to go with it, this by-rote, comedic sci-fi splatterfest is okay... The biggest drag, though, is when JJ gets a high-tech remake and now he looks like a T2-ish version of the Hulk. Now *_that's_* bo-o-o-o-o-o-r-r-ring."
3,Surprisingly Entertaining,"Some with say that the Jason has been done a great disservice by this movie. I think not. The ""Friday the 13th"" series of films became a parody of itself a long time ago (remember when Jason battles the psychic in Part 7?!?). That said, ""Jason X"" offers just enough blood and silliness to make it a good movie to rent when you want some mindless eye candy."
3,good movie,"this movie is good. some might say the story-line sucks, and i agree. freezing jason and reviving him in the year 2455 was stupid, and having an old earth and a earth 2, was stupid, and ironacly, jason ends up in earth 1, right at crystal lake. other than that, the movie is good, the killing and defanetly the new look jason were great...this new look jason should mean a improvement in the series, which i hope keeps on running."
4,THE FUTURE IS NOT SAFE,"This is a novel approach to the long running Jason Vorheese killer series of Friday the 13TH fame. Set in the future Jason Is a prisioner in a camp. He escapes but is trapped in a frozen state untill the year 2445! By then the earth has expired itself into a lifeless ball of dirt and man has moved out into space to Earth 2. A future space craft of mostly students uncover Jasons body and bring it aboard to examine and to profit from it. Let the killing begin.... Later Jason meets his match in the form of a female cyborg, who blows him apart. But technolgy has advanced so far by now the man has created nano-bytes to repair any injury. So the little bugs go to work on Jason and create a super Jason. Half himself half terminator. Let the killing begin again.... This is really not a bad movie and I was suprized that they could stiil breath life into a charcter that began in the 80's."
1,whats the point,this is definitely the worst in the series it has damaged the series and hopefully this is the last of the forever terrible friday 13th movies(except the origanal).this sees jason on a space ship in 2445 and by god is it terrible.there are no scares or jumps its a little combo or star wars x men friday 13th and minority report.
1,Jason X,"This movie is one of the worst in the ""Friday the 13th"" series. First of all i found there to be no story line and to be the worst Jason movie that i have ever seen considering i have seen all the Jason movies and this one if far from the best. The only thing good about this movie was some of the humor that was included in it."
4,Best of Jason,It is entertaining and funny in some ways. But it is a fairly good movie. I liked it. see it
1,First Leprechaun now Jason!,"What's with the space theme crap Hollywood endorses in these films. I would have been pleased to have seen Jason back in Crystal Lake for a 10th time rather him in space. They should have ended it in part 5 but no, they had to go on and make hilarious sequels instead of horrifying ones. On a positive side, this is the 2nd worst Jason film as The New Blood takes the cake."
2,What?!,"Can you say ""What?!"" This movie almost stunk! Why did people like this so much?! Space marines getting picked off one by one. And one good CAM SHOT of Jason's new ""EVIL GETS AN UPGRADE"" mask. What?! Sapce marines?! Leprechaun 4:In Space! Jello! Er...Hello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Jason Goes to Space,"Jason X is the tenth film about Jason Voorhees where he is the subject of research on regeneration, but as expected something goes terrible wrong. Jason gets free and slaughters all in his presence, but a young female scientist gets away and luckily gets Jason caged in a cryogenic freezer. However, she gets stabbed through the door and gets frozen together with Jason. Almost a half millennium later a small group of researching students stumble across the room where Jason is frozen, and they are about to get a blood splatter surprise on their throats. Jason X does not provide much more than a gory and timid roller coaster that is extremely predictable, almost laughable."
3,Very poorly directed,"Though this movie still has Jason at his best, here are the things I find wrong with this movie:1. Hockey is outlawed in 2024, probably because of Jason's relations to it.2. The humor, sex scenes, and such are no different than in this current time period (such a surprise).3. The time when Jason is in the lab defrosting switches for no reason at all to two people in the middle of a 20th century intercourse.4. The ""Lovebot"" looks like a ravaged Cosmopolitan model.5. Jason simply shouldn't have hair, no matter what ""body repairs"" he can do to himself!6. They talk about getting ""beamed off"" the ship after the professor is killed--unacceptable for the new time period!Now that that summary is over, I must give the film credit for never failing to carry on Friday traditions such as the unmasking scene, the nothing-but-dispatching scene, and the assurance that there will have to be a continuation.So, while it's not the best, it shows us that anything could happen today or tomorrow."
1,waste of money,"and i thought part 9 was bad, wait till you get a load of this garbage! sean cunningham should be ashamed of himself for being a part of this laughfest. and kane hodder should never play jason ever again after believing this role as jason in space. the jason franchsie is finsihed and all the fans have been lyed to once again, if you wanna watch real jason see part 3 the rest is a comedy shgow."
3,not exactly a horror movie nowadays,"well.. the first half woulda been like normal, but after that it got weird. The first death was really cool, but after that it got pretty bad. umm I'd go to see it again just because Lisa Ryder is in it playing an android. She's awesome and funny in this. This horror movie is made 70's style 400 years in the future. it's pretty cheesy, but you're gonna hear more pathetic laughs then frightened screams this time around."
3,One of the better movies in the series.,"The year is 2455, and a cryogenically frozen Jason Voorhees and Voorhees expert Rowan (Lexa Doig) have been brought aboard a spacecraft full of students and soldiers. Guess who gets thawed and goes on a killing rampage? 10th entry (!) in this very long running slasher series is played almost entirely for laughs, and while it takes way too long to get going (half-way through is when it gets really funny), this is hilarious, fast-paced gory fun for the last forty-five minutes. Kudos to Peter Mensah for a decent performance as the likeable head soldier and a sexy Lexa Doig as the heroine (who, unfortunately, doesn't get the chance to kick that much ...). The big laughs, decent special effects, and superb gore make this one of the better entries of the Friday the 13th's ..."
1,Though I'm a huge fan of Jason...,"this movie was absolutely horrible. It would have been one thing if the latest installment of Friday the 13th could've at least made fun of itself, but that couldn't even be achieved. The only good things about this movie was the quality of female cast members, and some reasonably decent killings done with practical effects. For a time when CG in movies has gotten so good, Jason X failed in that department as well, with horribly executed CG scenes and simply bad design. If there are any plans for a part 11 in this series, they should take a serious step back and re-evaluate, as well as shoot Farmer who wrote this [awful] script."
1,Very disappointing sequel...,"I finally was able to rent a copy of this movie and see it, and I did not like it! There, I said it! This movie was a big disappointment for a good number of reasons. One reason is that the blood and guts looked ---------FAKE! I hate to put it that way but it's true. The violence looked very fake. If you put Jason Voorhees in a boring edition of Star Trek then you've got the idea of what this movie looked like. In the last sequel, Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday, Jason went to hell (duh!) But in the beginning of this movie, his body has somehow been discovered and brought to a lab or something. They think he's dead but guess what? HE ISN'T! WOW! The plot was O.K. and a lot different from the other Friday the 13th films, and the action is poor, the gory killing scenes are rather cheap, and the characters are just as terrible. Don't buy this if you're a true fan to the Friday the 13th movies. It's a letdown. I love Jason Voorhees..."
4,A very Jason Comedy,"I know they were not trying to make a comedy with this movie but that is how it came across. If you haven't seen the movie yo uwill not know what I am talking about but once you rent it what I am saying will dawn on you. The movie is very entertaining it just seems like a parody of the better Jason films(yes I know thats kinda an oxymoron however it is the truth). This movie has one key element going for it classic forumla Good special effects Horny teenage campers out for an intersteller jaunt And my personal favorite--The old Crystal Lake pattern of search ""Hey everyone lets split up into groups of 2 and see who can die the fastest!P>So parts of this can be very scary up you will be lauging instead of shreaking for most of the time."
1,"Big, sorry joke.","I loved the original Friday the 13th movies, even Jason goes to hell, but I thought this was the sorriest movie I'd seen in a while. This movie was like a train wreck; you wanted to look away but it was so horrible you couldn't. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Very Decent..,"Jason X, is a futureistick film, that has a simple plot. That being Jason killing everyone. Haven't we seen this before? Anyway, Jason X contains a list of kinda unknown actors, who do an ok good of getting killed. The only good thing about this movie, is that it has a nice arrange of deaths. Ranging from Jason Freezing a women's head frozen, then busting against the counter, to beating two topless women wrapped up in sleeping bags against the tree, and against each other.This movie is your average horror movie, with no real good plot, but lots of killing. If you are into this types of movies, please rent this movie right now. If your not, then stay far away from this movie. Very..very...very far away.Overall, Jason X is an OK movie to watch ONE TIME, not one to have on your shelf for future viewing. This movie is very decent, but not an Oscar winning movie.*** out of *****-Just Got Wicked"
2,Worst out of the series,"Jason X was just bad, it made absolutly no sense. I mean Jason in space? How retarted do film makers think we are? The only good scene was when Jason was in that virtual reality world of Crystal Lake and was killing those 2 girls by beating one of em' with the other trapped in the sleeping bag, other than that, this movie sucked."
2,Could Have Been Better,"This movie actually had potential. A few things which blew it: 1)What the heck is the Crystal Lake research facility? 2)The cocky and tough android (really annoying) who knows martial arts--why?? 3)Jason's ""upgrade""--that was cheesy and lame. At this point, why not have a Jason vs. Terminator? Now that would be entertaining."
1,GAH!...,"GOD...This movie was crap! It was worse than anything with Queen Latifa and Steve Martin! BLAHG!(vommiting)...In a future where hockey masks have changed slightly, Jason...well, he kills. Not even a half-naked woman robot can stop him. After he rampages for a little while, he goes into a room with an upgrading machine to ""take a 'lil nap,"" as he says in the movie. Somehow, the upgrading machine turns on and out comes Jason, covered in metal like EVERYTHING in the future. He kills more people, falls to earth (right by Crystal Lake, actually) and, predictably, doesn't die...he does skin his knee a little though.If I was a consumer, which I am, I would stay the hell away from this movie...DO NOT PURCHASE IT. Or, if you purchase this, at least stop watching WWE."
1,"another one, man will this **itty franchise ever die","I got bored easily with the crappy dialouge and the stupid killings. man this franchise has gone on way to long and when they bring Jason back with all metal and stuff. I just wanted to stop it and rewind it and bring it back right there. horribly directed. I mean the Freddy series is better then this hunk of dung. theres a couple in the series I like but that was way back when. obviously I thought where Jason went into the Crystal Lake reality and hit those 2 girls against the tree while they were in that sleeping bag, that was the only good part. fo people who dont have brains or the smart knowledge"
3,Futuristic Jason In Space?,"WOW! I thought the Friday the 13th line could not come up with any more dumb ideas. I was sadly mistaken. In this film set in the future has Jason somehow getting into a space ship creating havoc to everything on board. This script/idea plus lack of star power puts in an hour and a half of garbage. However if you want to see Kane Hodder's last appearance of Jason then watch this. If you are planning on watching this for backstory for Freddy vs. Jason don't the script is way different, or for back story on Jason himself, Forget it. Just buy the previous sequels."
3,not to bad,The Movie almost looked like some series that you'd find on SCIFI channel. It is deffinately NOT a horror movie. It was alot better than Leprechan In Space. I'll give it that. but still not completely amazing in the Jason saga.
5,If I could give it more stars I would,Whatis there to say about a brilliant think piece on the danger of cryo genics? First of all it was the single most brilliant piece of work to ever hold a very special place in my heart...it has touched me in a way that in many sttes is illegal and when the movie ended it took a little piece of my heart with it. Second of all if JAson Voorhies doesn''t belong in the future than nobody does... a future without Jason is no future at all.THe story was brilliant and the plot could not have developed in a better way. The dialog was beutifully written and the character development really helped me to relate and for those few hours in the theater I was gripped by the same fear that held the herooine of the story until she thankfully triumphed. I will leave you with one last piece of advice: get in as much hockey as possible before the year 2025 arrives.
2,Jason Goes To Space!!!,"Perhaps taking a cue from Pinhead and the Leprechaun, Jason has decided to take the always laughable and sometimes series-damning trip into outer space. He's already been to Manhatten and Hell so ""space"" should be a piece of cake, right?This is less of a sequel and more of a good-natured lampooning of the series as a whole. We got slaughtered teens going back to the lab to reattach dismembered limbs, Jason beating up virtual nymphos, and of course, we get the big guy transforming into ""Uber-Jason"", an upgrade that makes him look like a villian in the next Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie. Memo to Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Chucky, and all of the others: STAY OUT OF SPACE!!!"
4,Why does everyone hate this one so much?,"I thought this friday the 13th movie was interesting. It was inventive, funny, scary, cheesy(no way to denie it), and different. I thought it was cool. I mean, it definately isn't what I would call my favorite but...Thats just it! It was different!That is probably the reason everyone hated it. Sigh......Hey, it was better than Jason Goes to Hell. Some people just need to lighten up a little and except something different. Jeez!"
4,campy horror in space,"this 1 surpriced me. when i first saw the trailer i was like""jason in space? what the f**k r they thinking"" but i saw it and now i own it. it truned out great. gory fun that you have to admitt its good."
2,bad if really sometimes watchable,"I didn't like this film well only neat special effects and seeing Andromeda's Lexa Doig,but this one could done better like filming it in hell not space,but this one featues Kane Hodder as frozen Jason and when not frozen he kills and gets a shiny suit at the end.awesome special effects but to routine and dull plot."
2,barely transcends B movie,"The added sci-fi spin was a good ploy, and at first added interest for me, but the cheese just got more and more unbearable. I was glad when it was over. Rent, if you must."
1,"""Jason X""","This series has always been stupid and this TENTH! enstalment dosent help! Jason in space was the stupidest idea sience ""Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal""! The effects are not even TV calibur and the acting is the worst I have ever sceen! The rookie director: James Issac will never get another job directing movie. The set desings are so bad, its like they put up a wall made some designs and put shiny things on it!There is only one cool part in this movie (thats why I gave it 1 Star) when Jason impails the dude on a giant cork screw and the body spins around till it hits the botton! That was cool! But besides that the movie BLOWS!"
1,I've seen the future of horror... and this isn't it,"I went to go see Blade II (which kicked rear by the way) and I had the unfortunate pleasure of witnessing the preview for this piece of [junk]. GIVE ME A BREAK! JUST A TINY BREAK! This flick looks to be the most rediculous thing ever too be seen by the human eye. The fact that this even made it onto paper baffles me. How stupid can you get? I am so sick of this series, once you've seen the first 3 or 4, you've seen them all, so why bother even thinking about this garbage? Somebody needs to call ... Waste and Abuse for improper use of materials to write and make this ""so called"" film. Terrible, just terrible"
1,Whoops!,"I went to see the very entertaing Resident Evil and sat down with a couple of friends just in time to catch the previews. I love to watch the previews, a sample of the movies to remember to see. The Jason X preview appeared and the whole audience went wild. Not with fear but with laughter. ""Scary Movie 3"" I thought silently in my head. After about a minute or two of this sad excuse for a movie I realized that this was not a spoof but a real movie. ""Jason in Space"" you've gotta be kidding me! It's a sad thing these days when a horror movie can be confused with a spoof. For all that it's worth, this trailer was one good laugh!"
1,nothing new just outer space,"The jason movies were not good they just sucked. A mask killer stalking people and killing them for no aparient reason but this movie was garbage, but when jason turned half silver that looked hot but the rest sucked."
4,Jason in Space? Surprisingly Good Stuff!,"Jason X (as in Friday the 13th Part 10) sheds light on a familiar, though not too friendly, face: that of Jason. A ""miracle of science,"" Jason, is to be transported from a maximum-security facility to a research lab. The transfer goes awry and he's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended.Things become a bit complicated when in the year 2455 a spaceship arrives from Earth II (!) and revives the masked lunatic...The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good.It's just too bad the cutest girl gets whacked first...In a nutshell, Jason X is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."
4,Jason is the man!,"Seeing this movie twice is a luxary for me yet I have to admit that this movie is totally different from Jason Goes to Hell.I am sorry to that this flick did less cash than its other predecessors and I have to admit that it was a little better than some of the FT13 flicks in the long run. The technology in this flick was unbelievable! I only wish that whatever technology that is what we see in the movies can only be applied in real life.KW, man she kicks serious butt and I give that fight scene a 10 on the martial arts frontier. Look out Sigourney Weaver! Other than that if the producers of Halloween need someone to get rid of Micheal Myers, hire KM, she'll do the job real well (just avoid any emergency rooms or state of the art recupe facilities while you are at it).I rate this four for I had a good time watching it (except for the dizzing effect in the beginning credits. ...Jason Voorhees rules."
3,aaaaahhhhhhhh or haha,"this movie was quite disappointing compare to the previous tittles in the series....the writer of Jason x must of been more learning towards horror/comedy like the great ""army of darkness"" which originated form the horror movies of evil dead and evil dead 2 but then leaned towards a comedy at the last movie....sum parts weren't very scary at all they just make you laugh....and there were only like a couple of really unique deaths in the film, I still feel like all I seen was Jason run around squishing peoples heads lol. incunclosion if your looking for a really scary movie... don't get this movie. although if your a fan of Jason and you are looking for a movie that is really cool interesting and a little scary buy it. I just hope the new Freddy vs. Jason =)being filmed in Vancouver as I write =) is still made with the old fashion magic us horror fans love"
2,jason x,jason x looked like the return of the classic horror film but it wasent and puts a dent in the whole series.apart from terribel acting in this film and stupid sarcastic lines all the way through the plot is unbelivible and it turnes more in to a sifi film than a horror film. if you liked any of the previous films you wont like this one.
2,"Cheesy Plot, but hey...it's JASON","Jason X was a decent horror film, but the idea of Jason in space transforming into a iron robot is not what i call a good horror movie. It also follows with cheesy lines and a pridictible plot.There is really no plot, but i will tell you the basics..A icecube from Earth is took back to some moon in space, it thaws out, Jason kills people, he gets transformed into a metal beast, he kills..then he kills some more..."
3,"I'am a Jason fan,but this movie could of been a lot better..","I was going through my morpheus one day and stumbled onto Jason X! I was so excited when I could download it and it took a long time to download, but i didnt care. When it was finished downloading, I immediately watched it and didn't get what i wanted from this film. I mean, Kane Hodder was excellent in this film, but the other actors needed alittle more work, though. I liked watching it, but later when we get into the end, it kind of goes downhill. So, if you like just slasher, horror flicks, this is the movie for you. I have seen all the Jason's and i think this is by the most entertaining, not scary, but entertaining."
4,Not too bad,"All in all waiting so long for another movie of Jason, we receive Jason in space.When I first saw this preview I said to myself Pinhead in space.Seeing this movie though, was really not that bad, the plot was decent and had some good action, too bad most of it happened all at the same time and those pieces that didn't only happened with 20 mins left to go.This one is alot better than Part 8 though so it won't rate the worst.I give it a 6 out of 10"
5,Jason X is The King,"...This movie is the best of the series none of the others even come close...The movie starts some where after the year 2010 where Jason has been captured and it has been discovered that he has regenitive powers (no duh) so of course some guy want's him for research. Big mistake he gets loose kills people and then get trick by some woman who cryogenicly freezes him and herself by accident.Then is goes forward to around 2450 where some students find both bodies and of course bring them on there ship to unfreeze them well the woman anyway. Then Jason regenerates and hell breaks loose, they try using marines but no chance. I won't reveal anymore because this movie is well worth watching. ...the movie has tons of great one liners my favourate being ""It's OK guys he just wanted his machette back""So when this movie comes out be first in line, it's appropriately subtitled ""Evil Gets An Upgrade"" which indeed it does."
2,Probably the Worst Way To End A Series...,"Friday the 13th was reckognized for it's creative deaths, such as the Kevin Bacon's death (arrow through the throat). For a perfect ten, which it is not, Jason X, is truely one of the worst futuristic (or more technologic) horror movies I've ever seen (ever watched 'Leprechaun 4: In Space'?). Jason is frozen in an ice chamber, remade in the future, and killing a crew of space students. It is really stupid - the settings make an excuse for the writer to make creative deaths. Especailly when one of the students get thrown off a bridge and lands on a huge medal screw. What is the screw doing there in the first place?The ending (that's another story) is a really, really a pain in the rear, thinking there might be another hideous futuristic Jason movie.Watch it if you will. It's not that good."
1,This could ruin Jason's good name for life.,"The other reviewers on this movie do NOT know real horror/slasher movies. This movie is so stupid that it could possibly be the worst movie of all time. I can't even begin to explain how bad this movie is. You cannot make Jason as original as he was in the first 5. After Firday the 13th part 5, everything sucked. Now this? If Jason goes to Hell in the last one, how can he end up in space? Hahahaha. Don't waste precious time."
3,Vorhees A So-So Fellow,"Horror fans, like me, have long supported the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, it's escapist fun and clever use of dismemberments have made the films main character, Jason Vorhees, a pop icon.His legacy and blood soaked cliches continue in this volume of the series, but unfortunately what was once a low-budget creepshow, has become a digital EFX showcase.That's not necessarily a bad thing especially if any cash has come out of your wallet to watch it.Your money, believe it or not, is on the screen. But great set designs, CGI effects and costumes can't save the novice cast, or us, from ""Jason X""."
3,Liked the idea,"If it wasn't for the god-awful acting and silliness that this movie had,I think it would have been a cool idea for future Jason films.I know this film is campy as all Hell,but you gotta give the writers some credit for coming up with something fresh and different.The new look that Jason had was AWESOME by the way!"
2,Jason X (2000),"Well, I thought the Friday the 13th series couldn't screw up after seeing the first 8 films, but Jason Goes to Hell earned its spot in the 5 worst horror films I've seen. Now comes Jason X, I heard it was about Jason in the future, in space, I literally just wanted to avoid this movie, but if I had, would that have been a good idea?Actually, it would've, I thought this movie sucked too. Its pretty much a group of kid students, researching in space, and theres something about the end of the Earth, so the whole world is being transmitted to this new planet, this wa so stupid, and in my opinio, hard to watch for me.Then Jason turned into this robot type thing near the end, I literally just shook my head ""no"", and I saw how much of a fail this was. I know most people say ""Dont take it seriously"", so I'm not, thats why im giving it 2/5 instead of 1/5. But damn, I don't recommend this at all, its just as bad as Jason Goes to Hell."
2,Jason doing what he does . . . again,"Jason X begins with Jason Vorhees being studied as to why his cells continue to regenerate allowing him to escape death over and over. In a transfer to another facility he naturally escapes and kills everyone except one woman who tries to freeze him cryogenically but Jason breaches the chamber and they both get frozen. They are found 450 years later and brought on board a space craft where a scientist and his team of teenage students revive them and mayhem ensues.I thought the premise to get Jason to space and catapult him ahead a few centuries was kind of clever and there are some moments of humor throughout the movie that worked, but otherwise it's the same old same old. No one can act, they all do stupid things that no one not in a horror movie would do and Jason just walks around slaughtering everyone. There is no originality beyond the opening and I guess its debatable just how original that was."
2,so boooooring!!!!!,i didnt like this movie because basically it has the same plot over and over again with nothin new added to it. and i thought the idea of jason killing people in a spaceship was really stupid who the hell ever came up with this crap? its so old and tiring. people in Hollywod obviously dont know how to make scary movies anymore.
1,X -tremely Bad,"Jason in space?. Come on people!. That tells you something right there!. This is a movie that is a horrid attempt at bringing back the 80's slasher craze. It was fun, sure, but it just doesn't hold any water these days. This movie was excruciatingly awful. As bad as they come. The kills were okay, but there were too many and they happened too fast. The movie had horrible pacing. The director obviously had no clues on that subject. It was a mess and the film itself looked like a botched science experiment. Jason should've stayed dead. Very,very bad."
4,This is killer,"This is a great movie in the Friday the 13th series. This movie is kinda gory, but sometimes its good for a Friday flick. Jason is really awsome in this one. Although he's not really the original looking Jason, the disfigured freak. When it shows his face in this one, his head is a normal shape. But other than that, this movie keeps to the original plot. Jason's out for blood in revenge of his mother's death. In this one, alot of people die, Jason's second death in this one is really cool. This girl gets a missle launcher and blows off his head, leg, arm, and heart. Then he turns into like a Terminator type of Jason, with this look, Freddy wouldn't have stood a chance against him. But the end is pretty good when they finally kill him for the third time.In this one, it shows some of the original cast members of the original movie, along with camp crystal lake for a few minuets. Jason gets a body count of fourteen, this one is definately a great buy, lots of guns and explosions."
3,About Time,A movie franchise that has been plagued by horrible after horrible sequels finally get justice. A movie set in the future in which jason was unfreezed. Good acting all around and good directing.
2,simply a waste of film,"""Jason X"" is yet another installment to the ""Friday the 13th"" series and attempts at trying to add a new twist to the usual formula of the series. However, it uses the same formula as all the other films in the series do expect in space. When we finally see Jason get his upgrade, it is only for about ten or fifteen minutes and we don't get to see him go down town on anybody really. Jason should've gotten the upgrade near the beginning of the film to make it a little more exciting. The plot is ridiculous and even outrageous for a horror movie. The graphics are cheesy and look like they were made on my computer. The attempts at science are laughable There are plenty of hot chicks though. ""Jason X"" was just plain awful, not even good enough to mock."
5,Great Sci Fi Action,This is a good movie. The story has a very good sci-fi element in it. This is more a sci-fi movie than a horror movie. It is not scary. The score is exceptional! Wow! The music is so good. The thing that is cheesy is the killing itself. The hack and slashing is too similar to the one in the Rambo movies. Rambo is sneaky. Jason is not. This completely changes the mood of the movie.The extra is very good. I can see this movie over and over again. Great movie.
2,The Best Items Were in the Trailer,"A trailer can make a movie like the second coming. Jason X is not a good movie. It's too silly and the double entendre jokes fall flat. I;ve been patient with this series up until this point. This is, in my opinion, the worst in the series. Jason was reduced to a gag, and the ending was terrible.Although this DVD release is better than what Paramount did for the first eight films, it's nowhere near as good as the release of New Line's other Friday the 13th films. With that said see at your own risk."
3,Funniest movie of all time...,...or the lowest point in cinematic history depening on your perspective.The premise of this film is Jason Vorhees is revived for the umpteenth time and set to kill people on a space station. A space station! I could go into further detail but those last three words sum it up adequetly.
3,So Stupid its good!,"O.K. where to start off with this movie...Jason Voorgees is (once again) captured and is in this lab getting tested on. soon he breaks loose and kills about 3 people until...he and this chick get frozen! in the year 2455 they are found...frozen! and of coures the earth is pretty well destroyed and everyone lives in space! so they take jason and the other chick on there ship! they de-freeze the girl and she was freaking out, they explain what happened and she's nearly in shock! then she remembers about jason. he's still frozen! but...(back in the lab in the space ship) another young girl is working on jason's ""dead"" body, so she accidentally hits a button and he comes back to life (imagine that!) and he kills her and everyone except 2 people and a robot! and in the ending it leaves it completly open for a sequal: Freddy VS Jason..."
3,An insult to Friday the 13th!,"This is one of the worst Jason films that has ever been produced. The only reason I gave it three stars is because of the slight improvement it was over the previous instalment, ""Jason goes to Hell."" The acting was ok, with Kane Hodder returning to play Jason, but other than that, this movie was crap. The whole idea of putting Jason in space was stupid. I think that because Pinnhead's final film took place in space, Producers in Hollywood thought Jason should go out with a bang by going to the stars as well. But at least the Pinnhead film had a backstory to it that explained how he got to space.""Jason X"" has no explination other than Jason got frozen.Yes, this film may be exiting, but in my opinion it is an insult to a very great horror series. Another stupid thing was the new, ""Metal Jason."" All that did was make him look like the Terminator. Overall this film was stupid. And it was a horrobleway to end the series."
3,Close But No Cigars,"I saw this movie the day it was releasesd in the US and I was disappointed. I am a Die Hard fan of the Friday 13th Series, I went in looking to have nightmares, but I came out with a sore abdomen from all the laughing. If you're looking for a suspensefull comedy this is your movie, but If you're looking for heart stopping horror look else where. All and all this was a good comedy, but it is not what the true Jason fans are used to. Lots of blood, but not enough suspense."
4,A PRINCIPLED FOE OF ENTRENCHED POWER,"Listening to these exerpts from several of Cockburn's talks is a relief from the 24/7 idiocy of the cable networks and what passes for talk radio. He covers lots of topics of recent interest(the stolen election of 2000, Clinton's disgusting final days, the proper response to 9-11) and each time illuminates a part of the story ignored by the mainstream press. My only complaint is that he was much to soft on that miserable cheerleader for our Warlord-in-Chief, Christopher Hitchens, a man who reacted to the attacks of 9-11 by throwing overboard just about all his principles. He really should have been more thoroughly scorched - that section was not sufficiently ""incendiary""!"
5,Awesome!,"This is an awesome movie, for children, or for a cute couple that loves to watch disney movies."
5,this is one of my favorite disney movies,When i saw this for my first time I was in love with it ! this is so great that its on DVD! I love it! is fox and the hound 2 any good?
3,An Example Of The Mediocrity Of Post Walt Disney/Pre-Renaissance,"The Fox and the Hound never caught fire with me and I don't see much about it that's endearing. It dates from Disney's dark ages after the decline and near fall of the studio circa the early 1970's to late 1980's, and it just isn't up to snuff compared to the gems of the Disney Renaissance of 1989-2000. My parents took me to see this at a theater when I was very little, and I fell asleep. I saw it again last month and...fell asleep. To each her own but in my view this production oozes ersatz sentimentality and shoots low in its emotional range. It isn't in the upper echelon of Disney films and it isn't all that great a movie either."
5,Rare story with thought provoking message.,"Never saw this one as a kid but got it for my children and started out watching and thinking it was too full of old cliches and sterotypes. Then began to understand why this story stands up to time. It is about very difficult choices, friendship, loyalty, tribe and ultimately right and wrong. These complicated social issues are handled without being preachy or dogmatic, but making you really think. What an impressive change from the tired princess nonesense. The kids love it, has all the good elements of story telling and keeps them interested, but even my 3 year old talks about the problems each of the characters is facing. It is worth adding to your library and it is a regular favorite choice for my 3 girls."
1,Not for young children,"First of all I love Disney movies, as and adult, and can understand the hidden moral stories in them. This movie is about friendship for the adults who watch this. However, I watched this with my two young sons. After watching this movie, my sons turned every toy they touched into a shotgun. In this movie the human characters point guns at other humans, mistreat the animals, and use degrading language. My husband is a hunter and we have always taught our children that a gun is not a toy and that you NEVER point it at a person. This movie just destroyed all that teaching. I also am disappointed with some of the language used in this movie. There is no swearing in the movie, but there is a lot of language you don't want your young children using.As a mother of two young boys, I will not be showing anymore Disney movies for a long time."
1,Not the movie for my family values,"I purchased this move because it seemed to have that sweet, gentle story of yesteryear. Boy was I suprised.It has some of that but overall there are two strong, distinct messages. One, is that it is a harsh and violent world out there. From start to finish there are guns blasting away. The movie starts by blowing away the mother fox then moves to shooting at a moving car carrying grandma and so on and on. The movie ends with an ugly, violent scene between a bear and the man. At this my toddler jumped up and began hitting the table and TV screen.The second message is blatant mysogeny. Every woman is referred to as a meddling female or empty headed female.Neither is a message I want my daughters to have. I put the movie in its rightful place - the garbage.'."
3,Is Disney getting lazy or they just don't care anymore?,"3 stars is for the dvd itself not the film (the movie gets 4 1/2). So can anyone tell me is Disney getting lazy or maybe they just don't care anymore? When I heard that this movie was coming out I got excited. Then when I purchased it and watched I was very disappointed toe see that the picture had not been restored. Other Disney films Platinum, Special, Masterpiece, whatever have gotten restored why not this one? I hope Disney doesn't do this again to any upcoming special or masterpiece editions of their films."
1,"Great film, poor new DVD release.","An excellent film, but a tradgedy of a new DVD. The video quality is not restored at all and is sadly littered with scratches, jumps and a lack of clarity similar to the earlier Gold Collection edition. There's no clear line on whether it's the correct aspect ratio also becasue Disney were making different ratios than this film is presented in at the time (Rescuers Down Under) and so it seems strange that they'd jump backwards in futureproofing considering Walt's accumen regarding the Future and technological advances which must, even after his death, still echo through the halls. I find it very sad that classics like Bambi and The Little Mermaid can be treated so well and restored beautifully - and there was NO attempt to give this easy-to-love film a treatment it deserved. The only feature on here of any worth is a 6:32 feature about film making and a static art gallery. The other extras are all off other DVDs. Very sad. Naughty Di$$$$$ney!"
5,My second favorite animated Disney classic,"The Fox and the Hound is a beautiful film focusing on Forbidden friendship. Copper an american foxhound and Tod and red fox become friends as cubs but when they grow up, they become enemies. A tale that leaves anyone wanting to watch it again and again."
1,HIGHLY disappointing,"Disney did not make this available in widescreen. You would think that a newly released movie would be a little more ""this century"". I returned it without even opening it. It wasn't released in the theaters this way. I'll wait until Disney releases a version without half the movie hacked off the sides. BOO to Disney."
2,Disney's worst DVD,"This is probably the Disney Classic that I like the least.Released in the early 80's, the era with the poorest animation quality for the Disney troop, the story is also one of the least interesting ever chosen for an animated film.For a double boggie, the quality of the video is preposterous. It seems as if no one really cared enough to check the master they where using for this DVD."
2,Disappointed,"I mistakenly ordered this ""Fox and the Hound"" movie not knowing it was a VHS not a DVD. It is a baby shower gift for my daughter and the process for returning it is close to impossible to do. Wish there was an easier way- it will make me think twice about ordering things in the future unless I am very, very certain that I will not have to return it."
1,NEED TO RETURN !!!!,"This Tape was sent to me in Spanish, I did not request Spanish,and I also thought it was a DVD copy, not VHS. I e-mailed the person who I bought it from on Amazon,and they never responded, so now what do I do? I don't want to be stuck with a video my kid can't watch because it's not in English !!! Please HELP !!! I need to know how to return this to Amazon. My email is: TRISHTHEDISH2818@AOL.COMThank You,Patricia"
1,"Unbelievable, my son talked of using a gun!!","This is NOT a movie for young kids, despite the cutesy cover art. My son's 5 and the opening scene is the mother fox getting shot. Ok, let's give it a chance, we thought. Then Amos is shooting everything in sight with his gun. My son gets angered by something that's happening while watching the movie, he stands up and says ""I'm gonna get a gun!"" We almost died hearing that. He connected anger with a gun. NO THANK YOU, Disney, onto the next movie. And allegedly we haven't gotten to the scary bear or worse parts, no thanks."
1,NOT a movie for young children,"I bought this movie because I was trying to find movies appropriate for ""movie night"" with my three year old. I read the reviews that say what a great kids' movie this is....boy was I surprised when the mother is KILLED in the opening scene! As we watched the movie, my daughter's dad and I could not believe that it was scene after scene of threats to the fox, who is a loveable character. Gun-toting Amos is over the top...the bear is unnecessarily scary....we found very little of it redeeming (the last scene where Copper stops Amos from killing Tod). I did like that the widow stands her ground with grumpy mean Amos. We also felt that the romantic overtones between the two foxes was completely unnecessary for this age group. DO we need to introduce physical attraction as the primary reason for interest between the sexes? VERY disappointed and will be giving this movie away."
2,Dull and Too Depressing,"If customers want a film that sums up all the dullness of Disney, I'd nominate ""The Fox and the Hound."" The forest theme has never interested me because it's too common and the kind of animals are not that great. Poor Tod and Copper become friends but then they are forbidden to see each other and they don't even get back together in the end. What the hell?!The music is also too low, even during the bear fight. And speaking of which, that bear with the red eyes in the climax scared the crap out me when I was a kid. I still have nightmares with that bear sometimes today. I there anything I can compliment about this film...um, not really. Well I am glad Disney let Chief survive just like Trusty and Baloo, but it's still not enough. Unless anyone likes sad depressing stories, this is a skip."
1,Great movie but I can't rait Fullscreen to high,First let me say this a great movie about friendship. This movies values will appeal to anyone who lost a childhood friend. I would rate thsi five stars if it wasn't for the fact this DVD is awful. The worst part is that it is only in fullscreen. It was orinaly filmed in 1.75 aspect ratio. It also has no real supplements. When a anamorphic widescreen version is released with some extras I will buy it and give it a better reiview. Until then I will not buy it.
2,Poor DVD video quality,"The picture quality in the DVD version is very poor. I expected a cleaner picture, but it was very grainy and fuzzy. I was very disappointed."
3,Unremovable Subtitles,"The movie I received has unremoveable, english, subtitles. Well, I normally watch my movies with subtitles, but for someone who doesn't, this could really pose a problem. I tried everything to take the subtitles off, to no avail. So just be aware that there's a possibility that you might recieve a dvd like mine, with unremovable subtitles."
5,Disney,"First off, I adore Disney movies. Secondly, The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorites and has been since I was little. For some odd reason, even though it's my favorite I've never owned it until now. :-D"
4,A truly underrated Disney gem,"An orphaned kit fox (voiced by Keith Coogan) is found by a motherly owl who ingeniously sets up a situation so that the little critter will be taken in by the Widow Tweed (Jeanette Nolan). The woman raises the ""toddler"", naming him Tod, lavishing him with love and affection. One day while out playing in the nearby fields, Tod meets a neighbor puppy called Copper (Corey Feldman) and they become fast friends. Neither fur-child knows that the other is supposed to be his natural enemy, but that all changes when the bloodhound's master, Slade (Jack Albertson), takes him away for the winter to teach him to hunt. As adults, Tod and Copper (now voiced by Mickey Rooney and Kurt Russell, respectively) meet once again, but things are not the same. Break out the tissues for this one. Based on the book by Daniel P. Mannix.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,"Excellent, and very sad statement on friendship.","The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life.This movie portrays a 'soul-mate' type friendship, broken up by external issues, and then the sad re-meeting.When the two friends band together against a common foe, that's an illustration of true friendship. When they do not return to their 'true friend' status afterwards, it's a sad statement of the harsh reality of friendships and for that matter, truth, trust, etc... terribly fragile objects, all, and once destroyed, not the same vessels of invincibility they once seemed.Very good movie. Worth owning. Watch it with the kids, though."
3,Sad Movie,"I like this movie, but I don't love it. I thought it sounded horrible that Tod and Copper weren't suppose to be friends. It hurts when you want to be somebody's friend but can't. It turned out that Widow Tweed had no right to keep a fox like Tod for a pet and had to make him live in the forest, although Amos Slade still wanted to shoot him. The only happy moment in this movie was when Tod found a relationship with Vixey.I also want to add that it sounded more than appropriate for Jack Albertson to provide Slade's voice because Slade almost looked like Jack Albertson himself."
5,A Good Movie for people of all ages,"I am sixteen years old and when I saw this movie, it really brought tears to my eyes. It reminds me of how me and my best friend was. I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone should watch it on Family Nights."
5,the fox and the hound,my son has loved this movie since he was 3 years old and still loves it at 12. When we ordered it. the shipping was really fast.
5,Great Film,Lovely movie. Reminds me of Bambi for some reason. Not that the animation is even remotely the same or the story. Maybe it has to do with nature setting? My children and I love this film.
5,excellent,"just awesome! ordered this used for just 8 dollars and it might as well have been new, minus the plastic. very happy."
3,Not our favorite!,"Generally I like these Disney movies. The story seems like a good moral. But this is my least favorite of the Gold Series.Although the story line is positive (friendship) the shotguns (fired at the women, animals in the gamer reserve) other forms of violence (death of the mother in the beginning, mistreatment of the dogs) and stereotypes of women (""empty headed female"") and southerners (as readnecks living in shacks in the country) pretty much limit any positive message.After I had seen the movie I realized that it wasn't the best pick for my two-year-old girl. Luckily, though, she's not all that fond of it either."
1,Go Read the Book,"the truth is, Diseny took a title and a few names from the original book and tore out the rest of the story to make a cute and cudley tale. The book may not be the best book in the world, but it is so real and makes a reader so aware of what humans do to animals. Don't watch this again until you found Dan Mannix's book The Fox and The Hound. Then go read Adventure Happy by his wife Jule Mannix 9 (if you can find a used copy)"
4,Not as heartwarming as I remember...,"I remember loving this movie as a child. Maybe it's the cruelties of life that have hardened me, or maybe it's the fact this dvd is crap, but I regret spending $30 on this dvd. Not to say the characters aren't cute and the ending doesn't bring about a slight misting of the eyes, but let's face it this movie drags on. To be honest the read along version (an extra on the dvd) was a lot more heartwarming than the movie. Nonetheless, if you have children between the ages of 3 and 8 I'm sure they lack the skepticisms I hold against this movie."
2,"Great idea of a film ruined by massive, unfair violence","This film may sound like a good choice for the children because it's animated and has cute-looking animal characters. I can well imaging it's advertisement: a whole-family film about friendship and loyalty. However, this isn't quite the truth.The film begins quite adorably with many heart-warming scenes. However, it becomes quite soon clear that this isn't really the harmless kid's film one might expect. To make things clear, this is a film about hunting with a lot of crude elements that will undoubtedly disturb many in the film's target audience. One main character is a gun maniac, trying to kill the fox using some cruel and highly questionable manners.In the end, this isn't a warm children's film. In fact, there are numerous scenes that will most likely disturb many children. It works best for adult viewers who won't get upset by it's dark theme."
4,"This item was a gift, so I don't know if the quality is good or bad.","This item was a gift, so I don't know if the quality is good or bad. I have yet to hear of any complaints, so I'm sure it's fine. Fast shipping. Thank you!"
4,A Walt Disney Classic The Fox and the Hound,This is one of my favorate (old) Disney movies!I really love the story & I still cry @ the end of the movie & Im 13 yr.s old!This is Disney's 24th animated film.Its a very amazing story of friendship & to me it tells you th@ you can be friends with anyone.So I really love what you learn in the story & @ the end when they are remembering being kids & you can hear the memories I tear up!I reccomend this movie anyone.
4,Enjoyable,"The first time I watched this with my three-year-old grandson, during our at-home movie night with popcorn, he found the ""man with the gun"" scary, but he was able to watch all of it, and now requests it. He comments on the characters' feelings - ""He loves him"" or ""Tod is sad"" - and I enjoy sharing the experience with him. I grew up on Disney animation - it still holds my attention, even if modern computer-assisted graphics are more detailed (okay, I have to confess to being a huge fan of Pixar's ""Cars"" DVD, another of my grandson's must-watch movies)."
2,Don't Get Me Wrong ...,"I love Disney flicks and so does my four year old; this is why we purchased this, he saw the video in the store and a trailer on another movie and it looked like another great Disney movie for kids and adults alike and it does have a great ending, but to get there you have to sit through countless attempts to kill the fox by the hunter and his dogs. There are numerous scenes where the hunter is shooting his rifle at just about any and everything. I am not against hunting, however, I do not feel this movie is appropriate for young children who do not understand ""Why this guy is trying to kill everything Daddy"""
4,FAMILY FUN,"While not one of Disney's more memorable classics, this 1981 release is family friendly and should entertain family members. The story is pretty simple: a fox cub is orphaned when its mother is shot by hunters, and he is taken in by the kindly Widow Tweed who raises the fox as a pet. Tod, the fox, meets a hound puppy named Copper and not realizing their roles in life, they become friends, until they get older and the hound is shown how to become the fearless hunter he's meant to be. The story is pretty predictable and the songs easily forgettable, but it's charm is in the story of friendship and little kids might shed a tear or two."
3,rented this video-small resolution,"The story is great fun, of course. I have always liked it. However, I thought it would be fun to rent the video and I watched it on my 26 in, TV. I was disappointed that the picture they sent to me, through the rental, was smaller than my viewing area. And it was not small, like a widescreen letterbox issue, it was smaller than my full screen area on all four sides. It made watching it a bit annoying, cause it was so small."
5,Movie order,I like this movie but wanted to get it on DVD . It's a cute movie that I plan on using again.
5,Holding up just fine,This product holds up well ( pun intended ).I have used this product for years withouthaving any problems. In my opinion these arethe only suspenders to own.
5,"Belt Perry Suspenders 2""",The suspenders are Great hook under the Belt stay were you put them!I carry a hand gun 24/7 the suspenders keep my pants up with the weight of the gunI am not pulling up on my pants now the suspenders keep my pants up I love that theyhook under my belt much better than the ones that snap on my pants these don't slip off.Only had them a couple of days Great I am thinking of ordering another color Get Some!
5,loved them. I bought these for my dad after his stroke. they worked great for him.,. I bought these for my dad after his stroke. they worked great for him.Very sturdy and very easy to attach to his belt.
5,"Product holds up its end,",Perry suspenders the only practical solution for a man who deals with trees and firewood. These are excellent.
3,perry suspenders,"these suspender work well- the only thing is they are suppose to be 2"" and they are only 1 1/2"" (just same as older pair that i own)"
5,Updated - Replaces Dampit but Stretto is better,"I initially gave this item a sterling review but after some use I have to revise my original.After using the Planet Waves for the last month or two I've noticed it doesn't take up the water as readily as it did when I first used it. There seems to be spill over even after two weeks when I know the humidifier is very much dried out. The manufacturer does recommend distilled water and not tap - even filtered tap water. The second issue is that with a hard case with a plastic outer shell, it works great. However on a newer case with suspension system with canvas sides the humidity is not retained. This was fortunately solved using the more expensive Stretto. Now keep in mind not everyone thinks you should humidify. After having to do some repairs to my original violin the luthier recommended humidification and I have been doing that since with my original violin and my new one."
5,One of the best!,"This is one of Troughtons best surviving stories. It is a marvelous DVD with great commentary by Wendy Padbury, Frazer Hines, Terrance Dicks etc. It is a shame that only 6 stories out of 20 in Troughtons era exist in full, but luckily we do have this story. I think the monsters are great in this, and the storyline is wonderful. This is an excellent addition to any Patrick Troughton fan, or to any Doctor Who fan!"
4,Great Patrick Troughton story,"This video is one of the best Troughton Who adventures. The main monsters are the Ice Warriors, who were unfortunately cut from the series after Jon Pertwee. The only bad aspect is the fact that it is not in episodic form"
3,Ice Warrior Invasion on the Moon!,"The Ice Warriors have landed on the Moon! Their intention: To take control of T-Mat and use it to alter the Earth's atmosphere and claim it as their new world! ""Seeds of Death"" might not be the most exciting Who adventure, but it's got plenty of comedy, Troughton gives one wacky performance. Scientific credibility is given a break for the day, and some wonderful OTT acting, especially Fewsham, with his over-blown cowardness. The Ice Warriors themselves aren't that bad, and there's plenty of hammy deaths. Like all six-parters, there's padding, bad editing, and sillieness. Put apart all the bad things, and actually a fun 2nd Doctor romp!"
4,Great Course,I've tried several languages courses and am very pleased with this interactive design!!! It's very simple and the thirty minute sessions are over before you know it!Ha det bra!!!!
1,Cheap Camera,"You pay for what you get. It never worked even out of the box at Christmas. It's cute, but doesn't work. Invest more money for better quality."
1,National Socialism Returns,"The book is an angry denounciation of the free market system with absolutely no coherent argument to explain why. Barlow seems to be suggesting that free trade is never a good idea because some people may lose their jobs in the short term, of course, all consumers benefit from free trade but Barlow fails to mention this.The basic message of the book is that protectionist economic policy is the key to growth and prosperity. This type of national socialist policy is exactly what led to the collapse of Japan, and the rest of the Asian Tigers.If you want a recipe for economic disaster read this book."
5,The Message Is: GREED IS BAD! Real Democracy Is Good!,"It's unfortunate some people can't tell the difference between right and wrong! There is no such thing as ""Free"" Trade! For example, millions of people are paying a heavy price for the ""freedom"" to live economically miserable lives just because of WHERE they live!Let's all grow-up, and realize that might does not make right! That some poor soul living in some godforsaken slum has just as much right to eat, and have decent shelter, as you and I do! We all must work for FAIR Trade, where everyone benefits, not just the chosen lucky few!"
1,The message is: Freedom is Bad,"The essence of demagogue Barlow tirade against free trade is quite simple: corporations run by foriegners cannot be trusted. The second lesson is: domestic corporations cannot be trusted. Third lesson: individuals cannot be trusted to make decision for themselves because they may not buy more expensive domesticly manufactured goods. Fourth lesson: nationalistic government is the best type of government.However, Barlow is incapable of putting these lessons together to show that they would lead to the world being a very poor place in a state of constant warfare due to nationalistics policies leading to trade wars, and then eventual military war as they try to capture eachothers natural resources."
5,I cannot get over how awesome this case is.,"I've never used console cases, but Gator has forever changed my mind. This bag is so useful for carrying my 17x17"" live mixer. The inside padding is thick, but has some give to it, so I imagine a variety of sized mixers will fit well in there. The two external pockets are perfectly sized to fit the mixer's power cable, some cable adapters, and earbuds/earplugs. I love how thick and sturdy the zippers are. I can't imagine ever going back to lugging around my steel mixer without this case."
5,Jubal's Wish...a wonderful children's book!,I bought this book for my son when he was 2..now he is 5 & still loves this book. Jubal is an engaging character that children can't help but love. The colors in this book are what first made me pick it up. It is so cheerful & exciting. I highly recommend this and all Audrey & Don Wood books.
4,fiona hits the spot,"Basically, this is a beautiful album. If you enjoy Dido or Fiona Apple, or appreciate the lighter side of Garbage - then gobble this one down before it goes out of print! Soothing electronica blended with fuzzy guitar, drums (loops) that are interesting enough without trying to bite, and of course Fiona's lush vocals melting over the top. It's a nummy treat... except for 'Wish I Was A Man' with Shihad, not that it's a terrible song... it's just that in the context of this album it's a little bit like a layer of tin-foil in tira-misu (and therefore it cost the overall a star). Every other track belongs: 'Let Me Sleep' is an effective modern lullabye, 'I Don't Care' is beautifully tragic and totally relatable and 'Sin Again' (Ms. Manson must be so jealous,) can make you feel like a human firework. If you like the sound of it... GET IT."
3,A halfway entertaining cartoon for children.,"An harmless cartoon/fairy tale for children? I don't think so. The male chovanistic pig who wrote this story has a twisted view of gender roles. Women and their expected roles are pumped into these young children's minds at a young age which is obviously causing many of the problems in modern day society. For a young, beautiful princess to be happily waiting on seven grumpy, dopey, sneezy, sleepy, happy, doccy, and bashful men hand and foot is beyond me. While they go off to do the ""real work"" and she stays at home to clean and cook because themovie makes them obviously incapable of these actions. I think this gives young boys an altered view of their responsibilities as men and does the same for women by making them believe they are inferior."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. This book was described as ""every teacher should read"". I thought it would be written from an autistic child's point of view. It isn't. The list of 10 (in the first few pages) was helpful as was the chapter on visual organization. Other than that the book was told from a mother's view and was very preach-y at points. Most of the ""advice"" listed was general, common sense you should use with any child. There is a whole section devoted to ""no spanking"". This section wasn't even connected to autism. It just came off as a soap box routine. There were very few helpful hints. Even the section on ""visual"" organization was devoid of diagrams and pictures. I got more info out of The Curious Incident of the Dog at Night."
5,A Must Read,"This book contains the most informative and helpful material that I have ever seen regarding dealing with and understanding autistic children. The suggestions and tips are practical, not only for raising a ""special needs"" child, but for any parent. This mother has condensed her ""hands on"" knowledge and experiences in a way that makes it a MUST READ for any adult that works or lives with children, especially those identified on the autism spectrum."
4,Very helpful,I work with elementary age kids that are autistic. This helped me so much to understand the kids' behaviors. I even taught some things to the teachers!
2,"Another ""PC"" autism book","This is another lovey-dovey ""autism has its good points"", parent only has one other child so has no idea of the struggles of trying to fit a child with autism into a larger family, any physical discipline is abuse, sensory issues are 99% of the answer book. No one with any ideas even leaning towards more traditional child rearing will feel comfortable with this book. No one who hasn't already came to a place of acceptance is going to find any help here.Autism sucks. Children with autism are capable of misbehavior. I cannot wait for autism writers and advocates to get out of the politically correct, pseudoscience world so we can actually get some progress towards making effective therapy available for our children."
5,A must for everybody,Anyone who comes in contact with a person on the autism spectrum should read this book. It is a quick and easy read with the ten characteristics clearly stated and easily understood. The suggestions are concise and to the point. Every teacher should have this as a resource and it should be a mandatory read. Having taught children with autism has been a privilege and reading a parent's perspective has reminded me of that once again.
5,Great Insite,Even though not every aspect of this book applied to my child the things that did were helpful to read and will be especially helpful to my family members who do not live with our son and are not used to his daily needs. I will be passing this book to my family to read and then to his preschool teacher.
5,A great way to talk to family,My son was recently diagnosed with Autism. Our extended family was very confused and didn't know what to think. I went thru this book and high lighted the helpful things that applied to my son. This book is very simple for any level to read. A must have!
1,Too Basic,"This book is very basic, common sense. It may come in handy for the newly diagnosed family, however, its not very accurate really because every person with autism is different and dont feel the same things. Each chapter is basically telling about the title of the chapter, the 1-10 things etc. I read the book in about an hour and didnt learn anything I hadnt already known. I was disapointed."
4,Good reminder,"Easy to read format - Nice reminder of what I need to remember and address as I teach students in a functional skills classroom for students with autism. I would recommend it as a book for parents, educators, and other professionals."
5,A book every parent of an autistic child or child with Aspergers should own!,"This book is simple and to the point. I have a daughter with Aspergers and a son with Autism. This book put into words a lot of thoughts and feelings my children and I have. It gives lots of insight and positive views on relating to and raising children on the autistic spectrum. I love it so much, I've read it twice! What an uplifting and fulfilling book! A MUST READ!!!"
5,book,great book to have! very helpful with learning how to begin to understand what a child with autism goes through on a daily basis!
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!,"Must read for not just family members but educators, therapists and any one who has ever had any contact with an autistic child. Amazing book. There is a part in the book about clipping toe nails and how traumatic it is for the child in the book and I tried the suggestion from the author and it was like magic. If I could I would love to give this book to everyone."
5,Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew,"As a parent of an autistic child this book is a god send. It simply teaches and informs you how to better address 'scenarios' with your child. I wish someone had recommended this book to me 12 months ago.Ellen Notbohm knows how to express and explain 'their world' for you to understand. LOVED IT! DEFINITELY A GREAT PLACE TO START in this mysterious realm of Autism/ASD. This is a quick read for anyone that wants to understand an autistic child's world (family members, teachers, aides). This book should be recommended reading by the Regional Centers working with Parents of children with Autism. Thank you Ellen!"
5,Wonderful for those who need positive outlook,"I bought this book because of the other reviews, so I thought I would add my ""2 cents"". Even though I had already read other material that gave me a basic understanding of autism, this book takes the clinical aspect out and puts the human aspect in. My husband, who does not prefer to read about autism because of the negative focus of most material, actually read and enjoyed this book and I can tell that it helped to increase his understanding of our son's needs. This is a must-have for those who have family members that ""don't get"" your loved one with autism and why they do the things they do. Excellent."
5,Great information,This is very helpful in getting inside the mind of children with autism since I work at a school with children with special needs. I look forward to reading other books by this author.
5,Very moving book!,"As with all her books this is very moving. I cried often while reading this and ""Ten Things Every Student With Autism Wishes You Knew"". As a teacher of young children with autism this captures thier spirt and thier gifts as well. If you take the time, patience, and effort required you will see these children blossom into incredible people."
4,Helped me understand my grandson better.,"I purchased this book in order to help understand my grandson better. He has not been diagnosed as autistic, but has some of the tendencies of autism. This book is well written, and looks at autism from the child point of view. I will relate much better to my grandson now."
4,One Book Every ASD Parent Should Read,"This book is a thoughtful, insightful, hopeful and powerful read about your child. For parents like me, who's child is non-verbal, it will be revolutionary in the way you see your son or daughter. My only critcism of the book is her tone, at times, is too casual, chatty, and makes (to me) odd asides that interrupt the flow of the book.However, I highly recommend it to anyone who's struggling to understand their child on this journey."
4,Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew,"I liked the way the author pin-pointed the 10 things in summary form, and then went on to explain them in detail in proceeding chapters. It was also very helpful knowing that she was the mother of an autistic child, which made it much more personalized and obvious that she understood the devastation and mystery of autism. I passed it along to other family members."
5,A Must Read!,Great insight and eye opening. Anyone who has been touched by someone in their life with autism needs to read!This book gives awesome explanations about how a person who has autism experiences life day to day. I will be reading it again and again!
1,Not really worth it,"I got these to match the swaddle designs blankets, which I really love. However, these burp cloths are nothing more than cheap cloth tri-fold white diapers, with either ribbon or flannel accents in the middle. The middle panel looks okay , but the sides are thin and flimsy. I expected the entire burp cloth would be higher quality cotton or flannel but instead you're really just getting a cheap tri-fold diaper with some decoration."
2,Cute but not practical,"I bought this product thinking it was made of some secret material that would absorb liquid better than a standard cloth diaper since it was a bit on the pricey side. Well I was wrong. Basically that is what it is, a cloth diaper w/ a design. Not worth the money. I bought a 10 pack of white cloth diapers at walmart for 10 bucks. Ya live and ya learn!"
1,"The same over and over again, nothing new or intresting","I like Thalia but I'm tired of her same songs. It's been like 4 years listening to the same ones. First with her 2000 album ""Arrasando"", then with: ""Con banda, los exitos"", ""Hits remixed"", ""Thalia"", ""Thalia II"" and now more hits (same hits)?. The're the same they just change the styles but come on take a rest Thalia and come back with something new. I love mexicans and everything but that song ""La mexicana"" has appeared in all her albums sience 1997!!!!, what's that, no way!!!!.It's not necessary to buy this other copy/item. Just put your cd's together and you'll get this cd."
1,What is she tinking????,"Talk about OVER SATURATING the public! She just released a CD a couple of months ago... which was supposed to out do other fellow crossovers like Shakira and Paulina Rubio... and it FLOPPED! Shakira's crossover was amazing! Paulina Rubio's crossover was more suttle, but she did it, selling 280,000 copies of Border Girl, and Thalia only selling 170,000 copies of Thalia 2003!Both of the ""NEW"" (translated) songs this album has are not that good! They lost the meaning in the translation.The videos are okay, but I would not recommend buying this."
1,Pesima produccion,"Que le pasa a Thalia?, la chica canta bien pero esta recoplilacion es simplemente malisima. Faltan canciones que fueron exitos, solo tiene una nueva cancion y el DVD tiene videos nada buenos.Realmente este disco es un robo a mano armada."
1,WARNING: No english tracks here.,"I just bought this cd because of the cover, I remembered a song from her that my girlfriend used to play, it's one with Fat Joe I guess it's call ""Baby I want you"", so i saw this pretty lady and bought the cd so my girlfriend could have it. But what happen?, the song wasn't here, there was another in spanish and we both agreed that it was horrible. We only liked one or two songs but were in spanish.Is it my impression or this girl wants to be like J.lo or something?.No way, I just didn't like this album and by the way the videos on the dvd are horrible, I laughed very much with them I think that the are comedy videos instead of music videos."
2,"Overused, Overrated, Overplayed","Okay, so first we have Thalia's ""Lluvia de Exitos"" where her suppossed hits appear as a two cd set. Then, lately, we were presented with ""Thalia: Grandes Exitos con Banda"" with the same songs but over Mexican music. A few years later, we were thrown ""Thalia: Grandes Exitos Remixes"" ,and now we have this, which has the same songs as in the cds i laready mentioned. Truly, I'm tired of her and her old same crap. Her songs have barely made to number one, and her voice is awful. Why did we need a remake of the marvelous Alaska y Dinamara's "" A quien le importa""? Who needed her to sing her dumb ""I want you""? How did she even survived outside Timbiriche, where she started her career along with Paulina Rubio? Wow, lets see what EMI or Sony throws at us next! ""Thalia: Greatest Hits: Con Bossa Nova, Lambada, Salsa, merengue, Bachata, Heavy metal, cumbia, trance................etc."
1,The same again?,"I like some of her songs like: ""Regresa a mi"", ""Entre el mar y una estrella"" and even ""No me enseñaste"" and I also have some of her albums. So when I went to a music store to check this production (I was planning to buy) I noticed that some hits weren't here like ""Gracias a Dios"", ""Por amor"" and ""Sudor"" which was a big hit back in 1992. The only good thing here is the DVD but come on!, it's like she's releasing an album every month, since 2000 she's been releasing one every 6 or 8 months, what's that?. She should come back with a brand new album, new songs.I think that her crossover album was good, she's talented but I feel like she's burning her songs in the sense of repeting them all the time.Finally I would have added ""Closer to you"" that sounds very good instead of ""Cerca de ti"" and ""I want you"" instead of ""Me pones sexy"" which sounds ridiculous."
1,que es esto???,"esto es realmente un grandes exitos?? en español pero con titulo del disco en ingles?? no lo entiendo porque si no vienen canciones en ingles le pone greatest hits, que malinchista se ve,no compren este disco no tiren su dinero no vale la pena, es muy denigrante para los que les gusta la musica solo nos quiere quitar nuestro dinero."
1,Simply pathetic,"If Simon Cowell had to name this album he will shure call it 'PATHETIC'. Pathetic tracks, pathetic cover, pathetic music and a pathetic singer.she gets on my nerves by just looking at her enormous cheeks in the album cover"
1,pesimooooooo,"los peores ``exitos`` los peores ``videos```que he visto en mi vida esto es una porqueria no gastes tu dinero, de verdad te lo digo, y si lo que quieres es comprarlo comprate junto a este disco unas aspirinas para que no te de dolor de cabeza a la hora de oirlo.no desperdicies tu dinero mejor compra PAU-LATINA"
1,bastante malito,"esta muy malo este cd, no se algo le falta, como buenas canciones cosas ineditas originales cosas asi, deja mucho que desear esperemos saque algo nuevo pronto."
1,"Is enough for mediocre music , please no more dirt!!!","Is it A JOKE, TRUTH? This CD does not deserve not one...After imitating Jlo and other American artists and a known good fail on the market anglo, due to lack of voice and talent, Thalia throws to the market an album of successes?... Only I have the doubt of because she puts the versions in Spanish of the songs in igles that only she believes that they were a success in the entire world. In Mexico she was a big effort. Do not waste your money and buy talent, I recommend to you the new album of Norah Jones,Cyndi Lauper, Pink, Alicia Keys or Paulina Rubio, real singers with real talent..."
3,"Thalía, another one?","I have to admit, I am a huge Thalía fan, I have (I'm pretty sure) every single studio album she has ever made, and some of them good, and some of them ok, and some of them just ""eh..maybe later."" But this one, how many Greatest Hits albums does she need? ""Grandes Éxitos: Con Banda,"" ""Thalía's Hits Remixed,"" I mean, it seems like a record-selling gimmick. I really did want this album, and sort of still do, mainly for the bonus trax and the DVD, but if I want all the so called ""Grandes Éxitos"" and the DVD, I have to spend nearly $30-40 seeing as the cd w/only the ""Grande Éxitos"" and bonus trax does not come included w/ the DVD. I have to buy the CD/DVD and I don't even get all the ""Grandes Éxitos"" and only 1 bonus track. Come on, Thalía, give us a break. Put them all together (the complete ""Grandes Éxitos"" and DVD) like Shakira did. Oh, one more thing, why name a Spanish CD ""Greatest Hits""?..."
1,no se que decir,"este cd si muestra exitos de Thalia , pero yo esperaba algo mas o quizas un disco mas inedito y despues sacar este cd recopilatorio ya que no ha pasado mucho tiempo entre sus recopilatorios de banda y remixes, no se tantos discos tan juntos me suena como a desesperaciòn pero no comprendo esa desesperacion realmente Thalia necesita dinero?? o porque lo hace?"
1,Boring..,"Another greatest hits album, to a not so great career, thankgoodnes for Amoeba Records..they buy this stuff back."
1,THALIA IS A REAL PRODUCT WITHOUT MUSICAL IDENTITY,"Musicly, this compilation has nothing new and exciting to offer, she is an entertainer that has no direction, the only virtue she has, is her beauty and her ability to make people feel sorry for her, trough her constant media exposure, fake news about her personal life and excesive publicty.Her musical career has gone nowhere after marriying to mogul Mottola, ex of Mariah carey, the difference is that Mariah has a REAL voice. Thalia's english debut is the less Thalia cd, trying to sound to Minogue or Lopez or Rubio.Another quality of this latin star is to do FARSE in the spanish soap operas, her career is a complete farse, a REAL PRODUCT. Honestly i would not buy this HITS not even download it from internet, it may cointain a virus.But she still PRETTY. Kisses Thalia and all her fans."
1,baja calidad,"yo tenia entusiasmo para comprar este cd, porque venian sus mas grandes exitos y 2 canciones nuevas, pero mi sorpresa fue que no vienen todos sus exitos, y las 2 canciones nuevas son muy de baja calidad , siempre es lo mismo y la de accion y reaccion es muy naka, tanto dinero de su esposo y no poder hacer algo bueno."
1,asqueroso,"este album es asqueroso como dicen en un review anterior Thalia no tiene tantos exitos como dicen, la chava esta bien y su musica pasa pero este cd no le veo nada bueno hubiera estado deacuerdo si no hubieran sacado el disco de grandes exitos con banda y el de remixes este hubiera sido bueno, pero ya cansa un poco esto de sus grandes exitos que ni son exitos tendra 2 o 3 canciones pero mmm no se a mi me deja mucho que desear como compradora de discos, espero pronto saque un disco en español y mejore su calidad y evolucione un poco, yo se que ella puede porque es grande."
1,"Muy malo, malisimo","No se que es lo que pasa con Thalia que solo publica las mismas canciones. Este dc con dvd realmente no tiene nada de especial, solo tiene una nueva cancion y no aparecen todos sus exitos, salen algunos.No recomiendo para nada este cd, es botar el dinero, es solo un medio de hacer dinero sin dar nada a cambio.Realmente la reina de las Divas mexicanas es Paulina. Ella no necesita publicar discos cada 6 meses para poder vender."
1,I don't really understand?????????????,"Since Thalia is not considered a superstar in Latin America, I don't understand why is she releasing a greatest hit album? this is just old crappy pop music.Desde cuando Thalia es una cantante famosa? no entiendo porque saca un cd de exitos si no es exitosa?, esto es una bola de pop chatarra asqueroso que no merece ni un centavo."
1,QUE PORQUERIA!!!!!!!!!,"Please DO NOT throw your money away buying this CD. It;s horible, there is nothing good about, same old songs that she has done before. but what can you expect from a mediocre artist like her? I wish I could return this item and get my money back.Although she is from Mexico, I can assure you no one likes her over here!!!Thalia, I think it's time for you to retire!"
1,TIENES QUE TENER VERGUENZA Y DIGNIDAD!!!,"THALIA POR FAVOR TE LO RUEGO, ESCUCHA TU MISMA TU CD Y DATE CUENTA QUE ES UNA PORQUERIA!!!!! DETEN LA PRODUCCION Y LA DIFUSION DE TU MUSICA, NO NOS CASTIGUES MAS!!!!!!!! USA EL DINERO DE TU MARIDO PARA COGER CLASES DE CANTO, PARA APRENDER A ACTUAR, PARA HACER BUENOS DISCOS POR FAVOR! ESTO ES HORRIBLE!"
2,"Classified as New....definitely not in ""New"" condition",This book was classified as New....the spine of the book looks like someone's pet chewed on it. Decided to buy the book locally since it took too long to get it and now I'll be lucky to sell it for half of the price that I paid for it.
2,Broken piece when I received it,"I have looked everywhere for a three-plate rack and finally found the perfect one. It came in the box with the middle bracket broken. Fortunately, my uncle is a welder and fixed it for me but it wasn't as well made as I had hoped."
4,Love it,"I bought 2 to display a collection of antique plates. I am very pleased. If they had included mounting hardware, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Great product,"The horizontal, 3 plate rack was delivered in the condition described. The item was delivered in a timely manner. It was purchased for a gift and the recipient was pleased with the plate rack."
2,Winnie,The VHS is probably good but was broken so did not get to watch it. It has been returned without any problems.
5,Hip Hoppers Only!,"...This Cd Got To Me In A Timely Manner, Say About A Week AfterMy Order. It Was In The Condition That The Seller Said It Was---VERY GOOD. All In All, I Had A Very Positive Experience, And ToHave My Hands On A Favorite Unsung Hip Hop Classic...Heavenly!"
5,At last - a compelling arguement for the genius of Townshend,"It's great to finally see such a balanced view of Pete Townshend's career as a songwriter. This book certainly isn't for everyone, but for anyone interested in post-war popular music, and definitely for Who/Townshend fans, it's worth taking a look at. Smith's academic presentation may be a bit cumbersome at times, but generally his adherance to a narrative structure and even-handed presentation of Pete's oeuvre wins the day. ""No other artist in history of popular music has achieved the artistic scope of Pete Townshend's career,"" Mr. Smith concludes. Amen to that."
1,An Academic's Attempt To Dissect A Genius,"Okay - if you're a major Pete Townshend fan, you're gonna' want this book. But be prepared - it reads like a decent dissertation topic larded with heavy dollops of pop psych and repetition to get it up to acceptable book-length. (One example: Smith questions throughout why Daltrey kept singing Townshend's increasingly-personal and introspective songs. As if Daltrey had any real choice - a point Smith himself makes near the end of the book when he quotes Daltrey expressing his gratitude to Townshend, without whom he would have been ""a factory worker."")Townshend is a genius who has spoken so eloquently for himself, to God and to anyone else who cared to listen, for more than 30 years. Sadly, though Smith relates lots of incidents and quotes tons of lyrics, it's as if he can't get a bead on the the music ... or the man."
1,Incompatible media,This is a terrible DVD audio disc. I was never able to play it as it's not compatible with any player listed in the market (DVD or Blu-ray neither PC) even if they say DVD-Audio compatible. I bought it in 2007 and since then I tried several options and equipment with no positive results. The information is recorded on the AUDIO_TS part of the disc which is unreadable as that kind of format was replaced in the past so the information is now recorded on the VIDEO_TS part of any standard DVD-Audio you can find on the market these days. Due the time of purchase I was not able to return it to Amazaon. A waste of money.The one star rate is because there's no possibility to rate zero stars !!
5,A wonderful children's video,My children love to watch At The Zoo and At The Zoo 2. The songs and animals keep a child's interest and immagination. I'm very glad that I got them.
5,Good Movie - Wrong Aspect Ratio,Great movie! But...Unfortunately Amazon advertises this with a screen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 when it really comes in at 1.33:1 - FULL SCREEN! Beware if you're a wide screen fan.
5,Not a moment to soon me ol son,"this a movie with a soul. every character is on a quest. a quest for who they want to be. all of them are unhappy with thier lives and want a second chance to put things right. the music is fresh and jimmy nail was very impressive. if you like billy connerlly then you will love still crazy, he as always has some excellent lines. it follows them from their original breakup through the reunion and touring. it is both funny and spirtual looking at life in a humorous but serious way. i cannot recommend this movie enough. the featurette on the dvd is also a nice feature. watch it."
4,A surprisingly good film,"We rented this on impulse because it had Billy Connolly. The description reminded us of This Is Spinal Tap (which we love) and we greatly enjoyed the movie. Bill Nighy's clueless Ray was really wonderful and Stephen Rea as keyboardist Tony Costello was enjoyable to watch but the scene-stealer was Timothy Spall's Bilbo Baggot, the drummer. I just about fell off my seat when he finds out that his most vivid memory of touring is when the Fruit played the Hollywood Bowl--only to hear they never played there. And Billy Connolly is always a treat to watch, whatever he does."
3,Fairly entertaining,"A fairly entertaining though not groundbreaking comedy-drama about the reunion and retro-tour by British Rock Band Strange Fruit of the Netherlands, 20 years after an acrimonious breakup.The music is good, and there are some humorous and memorable moments, though the movie is slow to start.A great cast, and a good flow.Worth seeing for a quiet evening at home, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,I`m Not Too Crazy About It,"This british movie about a 70`s rock band named ""Strange Fruit"" that makes a comeback isn`t funny enough to be a sucessful comedy neither deep enough to qualify as a drama. It`s a competent, at times moving picture, not too memorable but mildly enjoyable. The acting is fine, but the plot, that focuses the band members effort to became famous again, isn`t very absorbing or grabbing.What we end up having here is a little movie about the music business, showing how those who had sucess in their youth react when they aren`t so stellar today and have to deal with their aging process. Mildly interesting, even if it`s another movie to watch once and be done with it. I`m not sorry I watched it, but I don`t feel the need to watch it again."
1,Don't bother,This movie makes for a nice sleeping pill. When it was over I was still waiting for it to start. What the story lacks the music doesn't make up for. If your looking for a movie similar to this try(Eddie and the Crusiers) not a great movie but at least it has a nice twist at the end.

4,How about a Sequel???,"I have watched this movie at least 5 or 6 times and my wife as watched it 10-12 times, we truly enjoyed it on every level, the casting was perfect loved Billy Nighy very much!!! Underneath it all is a charming love story as well, the characters are totally believable and it's played out perfect and is correct with the technical end to!If there is someone out there who can help me with one line of dialog I'd be forever greatful!! After Ray falls through the ice and they leave town on the bus, he's lying in his bunk with Astrid and Les comes up and say's ""There's maybe some things I shouldn't have said 20yrs ago"" and Astrid replies; ""He's a very ???????"" I can't figure it out to save my live-----Please someone, anyone out there who enjoys this movie Please help us and let us know what she say's, Kindest Regards, RKG The way the movie ended it's left open and I would love to see a sequel---anyone else????"
3,Old Rockers,"A little crazy well perhaps a lot crazy. Old rockers coming together many years later to attempt to grasp the music, self-esteem and fans of yesterday. Sad people who are able to garner a short time of happiness. Rachael Sterling plays a nice role of a daughter about high school age. I believe this was her first film."
5,A Question of Stature,"My favorite rock'n roll movie.As movie's go, Still Crazy is above average, however, as a rock'n roll movie this movie sits miles above. It's a question of stature. Although I enjoy watching Spinal Tap (only with the voice over commentaries switched on), Still Crazy is both funny and convincing.When you are feeling ""too old to rock'n roll, yet too young to die"", simply insert this movie into the DVD player, sit back, relax and enjoy.""I, I want my thoughts to be heardThe unspoken words of my wisdomToday, as the light starts to closeTomorrow who knows who will listen""Either the flame still burns or you die lonely and miserable.Well it's better than being a wanker!"
5,Turning back the clock,"For all those of us who have always wondered, what if I could go back and redo or finish something that I started so long ago, and would my life, or that of those around me be any better or worse, this film is for you. The cast are incredible, the story line is certainly fictional, but nonetheless appealing to all of us. The characters are rich and full, and any of us, could no doubt substitute for any one of them. The term ""cult film"", although somewhat negative in its conotations, may surely apply here, as it may not appeal to everyone, given that it is a definitive ""British"" film, but given a chance, the viewer will certainly enjoy the various goings on. Hilariously funny, and yet completely touching, I highly recommend this movie."
5,Fantasic!,I've seen this film at least a dozen times. A brilliant mix of comedy and drama -- with some amazing songs as well. Spinal Tap with heart. Definitely check it out.
3,True Crime,"This movie has its good and bad points and in the end they balance each other out to make this a reasonably decent movie to watch once. Personally, I'm not an especially big fan of these race-against-time kind of movies--especially when they are based upon true events. There's an important message in this movie, and it could have been handled in a more original manner. Not one of Clint's best movies, but certainly not one of his worst, either."
4,Eastwood still good,"I think that this film demonstrates Clint Eastwood's continued improvements as a director well. Of his latest efforts it is one of my favourites. The cast are great (James Woods and Isaiah Washington shine), and Eastwood himself is particularly good when acting against them (I think acting with good actors always brings Clint's performances up several levels). The DVD has some decent extras, but the film is the reason for watching it. Overall a good story, very well directed and acted."
4,Let's say it was OK !,"I've read the reviews from other people, and felt they were a bit unfair. I completly agree that seeing Clint half-naked isn't the best scene in the movie, that the plot is somehow predictible, and Clint should play womanizers anymore.Still, Clint is still a fantastic actor, the performance by Isaiah Washington is nothing less than outstanding.The movie itself has a light smell of the 70s, which remind the Dirty Harry days.I enjoyed this movie, I can also accept some people didn't, but I think it was good"
3,Suspense thriller--flawed but worth a look.,"Clint plays a reporter in this film--a womanizer who cannot maintain relationships. However, he is a very good investigative reporter who has a nose for injustice.The story builds suspense throughout as Clint races the clock to save an man unjustly accused from being executed. Clint does his usual good job as an actor. Unfortunately the script is not up to the story line--the dialogue is corny and false. Several of the scenes calculated to be gutsy and comical come off as silly. James Woods chews the scenery. Not Clint's best but worth a look."
5,Excellent DVD!,No worries! Arrived on time and in perfect condition! I had thought that the dvd would be scratched or damaged but it was perfect. Thanks for your service!
3,Slow,"The first half of this movie moved slowly, but the pace picked up towards the end. Had trouble envisioning Clint with a small child."
1,Not Entertaining,It was just slow and no one wants to see an old man who has not learned a few things in his life time. I sure dont.
1,Major disappointment,"We had high hopes for this Eastwood movie that was new to us, but it was one of the most poorly written screenplays I've had the misfortune to view. Don't waste your time on this one. Also bought Absolute Power which was way better if it like Eastwood and Hackman films."
4,Very good,"This is a very good movie and one of the first that I have seen that actually does justice to the book. There are minor differences in the plot, but some of the dialogue is word for word. The supporting cast is wonderful. Isaiah Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton give Oscar caliber performances. James Woods is well...James Woods. Dennis Leary was a great surprise in his role as the paper's editor. Washington and Lisa Gay Hamilton are the true stars, however. As a parent, I must say that the scene in which Washington says goodbye to his daughter is unbelievable. It could not have been done any better. I recommend this video highly and look forward to seeing these two in more films in the near future."
2,Mediocre at Best,"This could have been a truly great movie, but I think the dramatic moments fell flat (with the exception of the ""death"" scene which was grossly overdone). Rather than weaving an intricate web of Everett's personal and ""professional"" lives, I found it difficult to tell what the focus of the film was supposed to be. I really enjoyed the performances by Isiah Washington and the supporting cast of his family, and I would certainly never argue that Eastwood is less than a magnificent actor. However, this film did not use the acting talent of the cast to its fullest. Bottom Line: Worth renting, I wouldn't buy it."
2,BAD CALL CLINT,With all due respect to the great legendary actor Clint Eastwood I'm afraid this movie was lacking. It is realy disgusting after you've seen his better works and can compare them. Clint is great but he is a badass not a fricken reporter.
1,"True Crime, wasting 2 hours of my time.","As a long term clint Eastwood fan, I found this movie to be a big disappointment. Eastwood's direction is poor, the excitment that should have been present in the story was not there. I found his acting much better than his directing. I did enjoy some of the other performances, especially James Woods. The movie is worth renting but I would not buy it."
1,Two Thumbs Down,The service and shipping were fine - no problem with that. The movie however is a real cliinker. UGH - it was awful. Don't waste your money. Two thumbs down.
1,Insultingly Bad,"Ouch, really bad. The storyline is incredibly formulaic yet still manages to have HUGE gaps. Most of the ""characters"" are left totally undeveloped. The ending is so simplistic and glossed-over that I actually laughed out loud. James Woods is strong, but has little more than a cameo. I found the movie incredibly insulting and condescending on MANY levels. If I remember correctly, this film was box office poison when it was released; now I know why."
1,Not much substance.,"I read this book cover to cover and could not find the beef. It seemed very superficial, full of homilies, and it never gets around to making a contribution. Here's an example: ""The language of coaching is about building bridges with others and not barriers."" (page 112). And another (page 4): ""Coaching in business is defined as an interactive process between managers or between a manager and an employee that enhances behavior, thought processes, and performance."""
4,"The Business Coach, A Game Plan for the New Work Environment","'The Business Coach, A Game Plan for the New Work Environment', by James S. Doyle is an excellent foundation for new, as well as, the seasoned manager. Jim uses numerous illustrations to allow the reader to relate to their own everyday experiences resulting in a better understanding of what coaching is and is not.This book really hones in on the fact that motivation is not something that can be applied from outside, but rather it is taking the time to understand the individual and finding the key (internal)to making them want to accomplish something.A must management tool for all levels."
2,chrome?,the only thing i liked was that the shipping was fast. i expected the nail polish to be kind of metallic because thats how chrome nail polishes are supposed to be. but when i tried it out.... i hated it.... it wasnt chrome... it was more like glitter polish... its not that bad because it was cheap... but it wasnt at all what i expected and i dont like it.
4,Great book to read if traveling to Fiji,This was a fun book to read while traveling in Fiji. It provides a great perspective of the history of the islands complete with interesting and sometimes entertaining antecdotes of the author's travels through Fiji. The text alternates between the author's personal travel experiences and a drier (but still interesting) history of Fijian native culture and colonial influences.
5,Nuggets In The Sky,"I picked up this CD based on a friends recommendation. The kids LOVED it! In fact we ordered additional copies as stocking stuffers for family members. An excellent, unique, colorful tale, filled with wonderful characters that children will enjoy over and over. As a parent, I enjoyed it's originality. ""Nuggets in the Sky"" is an entertaining and extremely refreshing ""musical nugget"" in a market dominated by mass-marketed mediocrity."
3,Rick Wills,"Hey guys,Bassist Rick Wills, who is filling in here (and on the 78 in the Shade LP) for an absent Ronnie Lane (who started the reunion but left before the record was made) didn't play in Humble Pie. Greg Ridley was the bassist for Humble Pie. Wills played on one Roxy Music LP in the mid-1970s and would eventually join Foreigner after these two Small Faces reunion LPs.Do get the Small Faces' ""Small Faces,"" ""There Are But Four Small Faces"" and ""Odgen's Nut Gone Flake"" CD, and then move on to Humble Pie's ""Performance: Rockin' the Filmore,"" ""Rock On"" and the new ""Definitive Collection,"" as well as Ronnie Lane's ""Anymore for Anymore"" CD, Ronnie Lane's and Pete Townshend's ""Rough Mix"" CD and all four of the Faces albums (""First Step,"" ""Long Player,"" ""A Nod's As Good As Wink ... To A Blind Horse"" and ""Ooh La La."" You'll be fine after that ...."
4,NUCLEAR DEBATE PRIMER,"No one was killed and no homes destroyed, but TMI is one of our most famous disasters for the panic it created and the energy legacy it left us. Ignorant of the basics of nuclear power, thousands feared death for themselves and loved ones, or, pehaps, a Pennsylvania made uninhabitable for generations. Of course such fears proved groundless.A quarter century on, these authors discuss the basic fundamentals of the crisis. they point out how things were made much worse by near universal ignorance, particularly in the media. Statements were taken out of context or misunderstood, futhering public anxiety. While the accident was not soley responsible for the decline of nuclear power in the US, it certainly contributed.This is a very short read, and was intended to give readers a general overview of the subject. It is certainly not a blow by blow account of TMI. I suppose that book is yet to be written. For the time being this one will surely answer many of our questions."
5,will order again and again,"I thought I would try this brand of bird food for my Macaw. After buying it, I ordered a second, and will continue to buy Tropical Carnival bird food. Its not made up of a bunch of little seeds. It has a lot all the large nuts and dried fruit. I could not be happier with this product."
5,Macaws eating big time,This is the best Macaw food I have found. I would recommend it to any Macaw owner. I have a pair of Gold and Blue's and this is perfect for them.
4,"Very good, but not great","Sammo does an excellent job in this film (once again). He is probably one of the only 70's gong fu stars who could actually act, and it adds to the film. The reason for the 4 star rating - a lackluster ending. The film startled me at first (very graphic rape scene) but then fell into the all to familar formulaic ending.... while there's nothing wrong with a formulaic ending in the kung fu genre, the better films have a strange or demented twist (see ""Thundering Mantis"" ). Worth the money, but not a classic."
5,Sammo Time!!!!!!!!!,"This has to be one of Sammo's best films yet. I love this and have this film for a couple of years and watch it from time to time and it is truly a joy to watch. My son loves this movie and so does his friends. Sammo is funny and friendly but very heartfelt when things go wrong. He is creative and boy, can he fight.The fight scenes in this flick are great!!! And as always Sammo has his way. If you like Sammo Hung then you will find this movie a classic and one of his best."
5,Loved it,Enjoyed the movie. Liked the movie. Why am I forced to write so many words. Got five more words to go. Done hooray!
5,Better and better,"Having read the books before seeing Tom's movies, and being a big Robert B. Parker fan, Selleck would not have been my first choice to play Jesse Stone. But after 7 movies I'd have to say that he owns the character, the laconic drunk with ""issues"" who can't help but do the right thing, whatever the cost. Parker is a master at creating flawed characters and Selleck brings this one emphatically to the screen. The supporting cast is excellent and one has to wonder what will become of Jesse's growing friendship with the Boston gangster."
4,Best Jesse Stone Yet,"Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and the Jesse Stone series one of my favorite roles played by him. The stories are unusual, interesting and often touching. The supporting acting is also excellent, particularly William Devane as the former policeman, now psychiatrist. I have all seven movies and hope there will be more!"
4,I love this series!!!!,"The first four movies are my favorite. I love the setting, the characters and of course Tom Selleck! I want more!"
4,Another Jesse stone,Very entertaining. Lives up to the story telling tradition of this flawed hero. The characters and the plot are well developed
2,"I Love the Jesse Stone Series, But...","I enjoy Tom Selleck and his easy going style of acting and I have enjoyed and own all of the Jesse Stone movies. This movie, however, disappointed me. In particular, it was difficult to see Jesse acting pathetic, borrowing cars and badges and more or less being someone who uses his friendships to get what he wants. This is not the character I have come to love watching. The character's untreated depression is beginning to take over as a central feature of the movie. The movie featured, in part, a storyline about a girl that has supposedly been Jesse's friend, someone we have not heard of in the past movies. There was no resolve to Jesse losing his position as police chief. The entire movie seemed poorly planned. I look forward to the next movie and hope he starts to come around because the way the character behaved in this movie was just too hard to watch."
1,Do Tom a favour and do not watch this,This is the weakest of all the Jesse Stones. It seems mostly to consist of long periods of Tom and his dog looking sad. There is a great deal of almost meaningless 'manly' talk with other characters but it leads nowhere. In order to keep us awake there is a subplot involving a girl we have not encountered before who was a great pal of Tom's. She is a dope addict slut and dies. Tom finds her pimp.(Yawn). The worst is that we expected - were even led to believe - that something would happen about Tom's reinstatement. This is unresolved apart from a hint that there may be a change of mayor.All in all a waste of the cast's considerable talent and my dollars!
1,Robert B. Parker is spinning in his grave,"Honestly. My wife and I have enjoyed the Jesse Stone series. Until now. When it was on CBS a couple of weeks ago, we sat down to watch it and after a half-hour of moody shots of Jesse's house, too many shots of that beautiful dog (whom we love), and one-too-many dialogue scenes that even Parker would have found embarrassing - we gave up.Look, I've been a Parker fan for thirty years and I admit he was never the most complicated writer. His dialogue was his forte and those who don't like his writing says it's TOO lean and TOO sparse. That's as maybe, but Tom Selleck and crew were always good at delivering it. This time, no sale. Tom co-wrote this script, and he's just not Robert B. Parker. Time to let this series go.For fans, go back and re-watch ""Stone Cold"" or ""Night Passage"" or ""Death in Paradise"" - the best ones in this series. And yes, we miss Viola Davis, too."
1,Where's Part two,"I agree with all the other raters who gave this only one star. The movie was very plodding and as the other subplots appear I got the feeling that this was part one of a two part movie. However, the ending gave no indication that another movie is in the works."
4,Solid,"Well written, well acted, good music, all around a good watch, love Robert Parker. Saw the whole Jesse Stone series."
4,Love Jesse Stone and Tom Sellect,"Yes, Jesse Stone series is the best. We have the complete collect of thisseries. Waiting for the next one to come on DVD."
3,Movie,I have several of the Jesse Stone collection this was an okay movie. Wanted it to had to my collection.
2,going downhill,"I think I have liked Tom Selleck in everything he's ever done. He's a likable guy and a good actor, particularly in western and cop roles. I really enjoyed the first three Jesse Stone offerings, but they started to slip after that. If the next one isn't better than than ""No Remorse"" and ""Innocents Lost"" I'm giving up on this series. Selleck should stick to acting and hire some good writers, some who can write dialogue. While they're at it throw in an interesting plot again. In particular this current installment has everyone talking in the same clipped two word responses. ""Do you do so and so?"" ""I do."" and ""Were you at so and so?"" ""I was."" and ""Are you a so and so?"" ""I am."" And that's it, end of sentence. This is OK for the Stone character but not for everyone in the story. Most people don't talk like this. This affectation is so overused it becomes irritating. Give us something better than this or give up."
5,I love Jesse Stone!,Tom Selleck is the only actor that could do this part justice. Since I am a Tom Selleck fan I enjoyed this one very much. I have 7 of the Stone saga movies and love them all.
5,"Solid writing, good cast.","This is the penultimate in this shockingly neglected series featuring Tom Selleck. In an age when most writing for television ranges from poor to absurdly bad, this series stands out. The cast is almost uniformally strong, the acting solid and the camerawork excellent."
5,"Tom Selleck, still going strong","Another must see in this series.....We really hope they are going to make some more,can't wait...!!!!!They could go so much further with this show in future episodes so please do not stop now. Just an all round neat show."
5,Another Jesse Stone Home Run,"This is the seventh in the Tom Sellick ""Jesse Stone"" Series, and it is as entertaining as the first one! Based on the late Robert B. Parkers books, Sellick nails the character with a minimum of excess chatter, letting the music and the visuals tell the story, with enough action to keep one interested. Its easy to catch up with the events, but I would recommend seeing the others in the series before seeing this one.Tom Sellick does Robert Parkers books proud in this one as well as the others."
2,Lost it,I really love the Jesse Stone series of video's. This one was the worst one in the series. It did not have what the other one's had. I know another one is in the works and I hope it is as good as the first one's. The only good thing was that Jesse did say that he would get his job back. I'm looking fowward to how he does that. Hopefully with some flair.
2,Jessie Stone Innocents Lost,I love the jessie stone series. I have purchased them all and have turned other family members on to this series. I was very disspointed in the last movie Innocents Lost. It was boring; choppie story line. I didn't get the thrill and excitment watching as in the previous jessie stone movies. What happened !!!!!!
3,"movie great; quality of dvd, not so great","i have all jesse stone dvds. the quality on this new one, innocents lost, is not as good as the previous movies. (i have purchased all jesse stone dvds thru amazon.com) i have played it on different dvd players to see if the player was the problem, however, the same grainy picture is on all players. how disappointing."
2,I'm a fan but this movie was a disappointment,"Tom Selleck's acting is still good in this Jesse Stone episode. The rest of the cast do a good job as well. The reason I did not enjoy this episode was the constant use of dialog/lines from previous Jesse Stone episodes--not just once or twice but probably ten or more times. It made the episode stale and annoying. Also, some of the dialog seemed rushed--as though it was being read not ""acted."" I hope the writers and director of the next episode breath some new life into the script and characters."
4,Good set of movies,I just like Tom Selleck movies. I would suggest most all of his movies he is in. I think that say's it all. I got fast service as well. Thank You.
5,One of my favorites!,"We love the Jesse Stone series. Tom Selleck is truly an amazing actor, he was meant to play this part. It's a completely natural part for him and the storyline throughout the series has a real-life feel to it. Very, very well done."
5,Jesse Stone,I have all of the jesse Stone trilogy and enjoy every one of them. Tom Selleck is a great pick for playing this role.
5,Tom Selleck at his Best!,"I whish there would be more shows like this. As I'm not a TV fan and don't have cable, I found out from my son that the ""Jesse Stone"" movies had been on since 2005, I've had no idea! When I read the reviews and realized that Tom Selleck played the leading role, I orderd the first five ones. After watching them, I orderd the last one and am more than happy say, I've had another great night with a wonderful movie and great actor. I love watching my DVDs (without all the ads and interutions) and feel they're well worth the money because I don't need to put up with ""sellavision"" in between.The stories of ""Jesse Stone"" have been written up in detail on Amazons reviews before so I don't think I have to add anything except I that became thouroughly engrossed and enjoyed them. I read that there will be another movie to follow in 2012 and I'm certainly looking forward to it!"
3,Good but not great,The last couple of Jessie Stone movies (including Innocence Lost) are lacking the Robert B. Parker charm. They painfully contain some of Parker's witty comeback lines but they don't flow or add color to the dialogue which sounds forced. Even the music soundtrack for Innocence Lost has lost that haunting feel. Much of the music is disappointingly bland and not up to Jeff Beal's standards. The story's plot was entertaining but it was obvious the writers used a formula not talent.
4,good to watch,An excellent story and well produced. Tom Selleck is in his element here. As the Chief of Police he was ableto instill his values of decency and competence into a small town. But now he is on the outside (of the police department) and is involved emotionally with the death of a previous victim. I liked the story and the acting in the movie. Highly recommend it
2,Missing Robert B. Parker,"I enjoyed the first five movies so much that I gave ""No Remorse"" the benefit of the doubt, but ""Innocents Lost"" continues the downward trend. It is choppy, unnecessarily repetitive and stale compared to the first five. I applaud the team for trying to keep the series going after Mr. Parker's death, but I hope they can find some new writers before the next one."
3,"Enjoyed it, but....","...it didn't really go anywhere and took a long time to get there. I do appreciate that the series takes its time to develop the stories and doesn't feel the need to throw in a lot of mindless action to keep things moving. I do like the characters and love that it is so obviously shot in a real location (even if it is Nova Scotia). I also like and respect Tom Selleck but you really have to be a fan to enjoy this one; I found myself watching the clock on the DVD player and thinking ""where is this going?"". Sadly, the answer was ""nowhere in particular"".I'm not sorry I watched it, but unlike the rest of the series, which I also have, I doubt I'll bother to watch this episode again. Hopefully the next installment will move the story along a little more."
4,Kaplan DAT w/ CD Rom,"I have both the 2nd edition and the 3rd edition. Most of the content is the same, but I did not have a 2nd ed. CD. The 3rd edition of the book is maybe 90% the same. As a prospective dental student who is reapplying (3 waiting lists doesn't cut it!) and needs to improve his PAT score (note to other pre-dentals, Practice, practice and practice for the PAT! That is the reason why I did not gain acceptance for 2005), I was pleased with Kaplan's prep material for the PAT. Very helpful. Really helped me visualize the shapes and gave some invaluable test day hints. That alone made it worth it. One thing I wouldn't have minded: they should have left the end of section ""quizzes"" that they had in the 2nd edition. Overall, most people will be pleased with the Kaplan book."
3,OK study material,"For the practice, this Kaplan book is worth it.The reviews for me were not specific enough. I studied my college text books before I took any practice test.Basically, the written test is good for pointing out your weak areas to begin with. The Preparation booklet put out by the ADA is another written test and is actually closer to the level of dificulty you'll see on the real DAT.The Kaplan science sections are harder than the real DAT, the reading and quantitative are about the same as the real DAT, and the perceptual ability is easier than the real DAT. I scored about 17 on the Kaplan total science and 23 on the real DAT. For perceptual ability, I scored about 20 for Kaplan and 18 for the real DAT.So, basically, the book is worth the money for pointing out what you don't get right on the practice test. Also, the more practice you get for perceptual ability, the better. In addition to this Kaplan book, I recommend TopScore Pro practice test."
4,Helpfulness with Kaplan's DAT Third Edition,"I am using mainly the Kaplan book in my preparation for the DAT. The review materials are concise and the examples are very helpful. It also comes with a practice test on the CD which I feel is necessary to prepare for this test. Overall, I am happy with the purchase."
2,PAT section not helpful,"no need to buy this book if you have your notes from your basic science class( biolgy, chemistry, and organic chemistry)."
3,THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD,"For the cinematography and scenery alone, I would recommend this movie. Set in northern Africa, the landscape is stunning. A young British woman (the always beautiful Kate Winslet) takes her two young daughters to northern Africa and exposes them to a completely different way of life, often grappling with poverty and unknown circumstances. The film has very little plot but is lovely simply to watch as a personal journey for Winslet's character and especially for her little girls. Imagine seeing these things through the eyes of a child: that is the opportunity this film affords. This was Kate Winslet's follow up to the blockbuster Titanic, and it proves if nothing else that Winslet is in the craft of acting for the love of acting and to stretch her experience far and wide. Not to be a star in the conventional sense of the word."
4,beautiful movie,"i really enjoyed the movie. it was breathtakign and slowly-relax-middle east pace. beautiful hippie things, beautiful middle east, and i absolutely lved bilal, such a lveable man.the only problem i really had w it was the way it seemed to cut from one sceen near the end to another one, i feel as though maybe my movie didnt wrk right or i didnt catch something. i watched the last hr again and it makes more sense but if you miss 1 or 2 wrds at 2 key parts you'll be lost. in sh'allah means godwilling if you didnt know, and bilal says it to lucy. : )"
3,Beautiful Scenery - Character Development a bit Weak,"Morocco has always been a dream destination of mine, and Hideous Kinky is a visual delight for the armchair tourist. The colours and splendour of the desert countryside are delightful.The story, however, was not really my cup of tea. With the exception of the young girls, I found the character development somewhat flat and two dimensional. Kate Winslet in a good actress, yet I wish the director had taken more time to provide us the true reasons why she was searching for ""the truth"" through the Sufist religion.Unfortunately, only a very slight amount of historical information about Julia and her two daughters is provided - leaving the viewer wondering why they really left England - and what they really hoped to discover in the the beautiful Moroccan landscape."
1,An Awful Waste of Good Talent,"I love Kate Winslet. I read the book first and then saw the movie. Let me first say, the book was much better than the movie. So much of this story was left out. I didn't even think the book was that great. It has a good and interesting plot, but it's so poorly put together. You won't be missing much by not seeing this movie."
2,How does it end?,"I knew I was in trouble in the first few minutes of the film. A dreamsequence of a camera following a young child down long corridors- a scene that is a straight ripoff. Long scenes with Moroccans chattering at each other in their native tongue ""cleverly"" unsubtitled to create an atmosphere of ""mystery"". Or maybe to put the audience to sleep. The plot takes so long to develop, what there is of it, that finally... well, who cares?. The movie gets pluses for photography. The scenery is excellent. Great art there. In this it reminds me of ""The Thin Red Line"". In fact if you liked TTRL you may like this. But if you found TTRL crashingly boring you'd best steer clear of Hideous Kinky.I like Kate Winslet a lot. I'll sit through almost anything with her in it. Anything but Hideous Kinky. How does it end anyhow? I didn't bother to find out."
3,A movie seemingly in search of itself,"Single mom Julia tries to make a living in Morocco with hopes of fulfilling her spiritual quest with her two young daughters Lucy and Bea. The script rambles a bit; Julia's relationship with her daughters' father is glossed over and reduced to his inability to pay child support on time, and a romance with street performer Bilal isn't deeply explored.Bilal apparently has an estranged wife, but although she's briefly depicted, little is said about their relationship except that Bilal is neglectful of her.The film does do a good job of including pop culture with music by America and Jefferson Starship, but too much of the characters' relationship isn't fully explored. Worth a look though for the beauty and talent of Kate Winslet and the culture of Morocco."
1,"The title should have just been ""Hideous""....","The most entertaining part of this movie is the title. I wish I had just read it, smiled, and then left it on the shelf. I must say I am a fan of Kate's (long before Titanic) and I watched this movie with a diehard fan of her's. However the only word besides hideous I can use to describe this film is PAINFUL! I watched it through to the end (after all I paid good money to rent it) patiently waiting for something to happen. Waiting for something that would make me care what happens to these characters. Unless you are a fan of artsy flicks with no particular plot except to see interesting looking people in interesting looking locations - skip this one!"
3,Beautiful eye candy,"A wonderful looking film; wide open shots of the country side, colourful villages, and Kate is a beautiful hippy. Inventive and engaging use of music with the scenes as well (kudos for including Nick Drake on the soundtrack). These things make the film certainly worthwhile. I have to say, however, that the story can be a bit thin and the whole ""spiritual quest"" theme is somewhat vague. Everything just sort of starts with Kate'n'the kids abroad griping about how daddy won't send the checks! The book is clearer on these ideas, but they weren't translated to the screenplay so well. Still, I can recommend the film if you know the book, or are a Winslet fan (and you should be)."
2,Two stars for two young stars,"I've seen Kate in a couple of damn fine roles: Heavenly Creatures and just recently, Jane Campion's hilarious Holy Smoke. I admire her in those two performances and find them daring and unparalleled. In ""Hideous"", I not only found the editing jarring during the first thirty minutes, but I never cared for the developing relationship with Bilal, the drifter. Those moments fell flat, adding to more distraction with the story. Winslet's lack of genuine responsibility as a mom for her two daughter's well being, left me questioning her character's intellect. On the flip side, Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan as ""Bea"" and ""Lucy"" absolutely shine and do a wonderful job. I'll just have to blame it on the movie's director, not on Kate. This is a film I wanted to like, but it left me wanting to go see Holy Smoke, again."
4,Very touching and realistic type of movie.,This definitly is not an entertaining movie but a good one to watch. Kate acted so good along with the two kids. Watch it if you only enjoy movies that touch your feelings. I think they are great once in a while to watch and especially when the actors excelled in their roles.This is not something I would even think to own in my collection.
3,Not a film for the action-scravers amongst us!,"Hideous Kinky is a film from a book. As with all films from books your expectations are high but almost always shattered. admittedly this film is not a stunning piece of work, worthy of academy award status but it does possess qualities which are refreshing to see on the big screen. Hideous Kinky is mostly set in Marrakesh, Morocco which lends itself to the uniqueness of this film. The two little girls who play Lucy and Bea are contrary to the usual hollywood brat, they bring a matter of fact and innocent aspect to this film. The plot is not fast-moving but this is a true story, definately not one for the film buff who wants to be thrilled"
4,nice thickening serum,"I thought I was getting the green tea Back to Basics serum because that is what was pictured and I really liked the green tea serum I had before, but I was sent a different serum. I should have sent them back--have used them some, but don't think I like them as well as the green tea."
5,Great Mats,"I have these mats in the front and back seats, and cargo area of my 2008 Rav4. They all fit perfectly. They are not quite what I expected in terms of the material- I was expecting a rubber material and these are more of a flexible plastic. But they do the job. Basically I was sick of trying to keep the carpet-type mats clean and this should be a lot easier to maintain. It does change the look of the interior to a more ""rugged"" look and less of a ""plush"" look so be prepared for that. Bottom line is this is just more practical. Since installing the mats I've already had something spill in the cargo area and I was glad to just wipe it up rather than having the carpet professionally cleaned."
4,Impressive fit for 2009 Rav4,"Purchased these to protect our flooring in our Rav4 and I am seriously impressed with the fit. The liners look as though they are built into the vehicle and the fit is very impressive.We purchased the front, rear and cargo liners and all of them are durable, well-fit and a wonderful addition to the vehicle.A word of advice though: the driver side liner comes with floor hooks that look very similar to those of the Rav4 but the hook included is a tad higher with a somewhat more aggressive looking hook....use this hook and save yourself the trouble of installing the liner twice or having it slip around. The added thickness and contour of the liner requires that you use the included hooks."
1,a real disappointment,"this book was advertised as used but in good shape. It was not. It even had ""discarded"" in the opening pages stamped and was basically falling apart. The seller had intimated that it was probably a first edition and I assume this was how he could charge nearly ten dollars for a book not worth a fraction of it. Buyer beware."
3,"Fun lift the flap book, but highly overpriced","My son was an avid Elmo lover when we bought this book for him. The flaps were fun to lift for awhile, but it simply did not hold his attention nearly as much as other Elmo stories. We only watched the DVD one time, and it was short. An ok book and DVD, but I think not worth the cost of purchasing new. Try to find used if you really want it...."
5,GREAT..SCARIER...FUNNY...AND AWESOME,"I STILL KNOW...IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, BECAUSE IT HAS MORE SCARIER, FRIGHTENING, AND GREAT PERFORMANCES. JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT, BRANDY, MATTHEW SETTLE,FREDDIE PRINZE, JR AND MUSE WATSON WAS GREAT.MATTHEW SETTLE(WILL BENSON) WAS GREAT AS BEN WILLIS'S SON. I STILL KNOW.. WAS A GREAT FUNNY AND AWESOME MOVIE AND I WILL BUY THIS ONE.I HOPE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER I STILL KNOW MOVIE WITH JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT, BRANDY, FREDDIE PRINZE,JR AND MATTHEW SETTLE. I STILL KNOW..... WAS OVERALL A GREAT, FUN, AWESOME, SCARY, CREEPY MOVIE. I GIVE IT A 5 OUT OF 5."
4,It was okay...,"The movie itself was pretty good. Although I was captivated by Love Hewitt's...cleavage. The wet, white shirt with a black bikini underneath did wonders for her. The end was a bit strange...plans on making a third? How did she escape the ankle grab? She's done better."
2,could have been,"OK Since this was a sequel, we all knew what was gonna happen. The man is gonna be coming back after her to kill her once and for all. But some how her and her girlfriend excape any major cuts or killings. Sometimes entertaining but not worth a watch."
3,Sequal didn't make it as well as the first did..,"The sequal was very pretty in terms of scenery and the characters (Jennfer Love Hewitt)! the acting wasn't as good as the first. Was also kind of cheesy in some parts. The black guy Mikhi Phipher obviously dies because the character who thinks he is a ""bad ass"" always dies. The twist was good. But again the plot was kind of dumb and some of it didn't add up. A good movie of you like JLH though."
3,It was ok....,"I actually havnt even seen the first one lol so I cant say it was worse. This movie was ok, I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as hell though so that probally helped. A group of friends (some survivors from the last movie) go to the caribean for a vacation they won. And guess what happens? A storm comes and they cant get off the island, but not before the killer gets on the island. Thats when the slashing begins. Some deaths in this movie are gory and others arent. I would say see the scream series before this movie. Unless you wanna check out Jennifer ;)"
3,I STILL love curling up with this movie,"I know its bad ,cheesy and laughably unscary for a film that is supposed to be; but its so enjoyable that who honestly gives a damn?A perfect popcorn flick."
4,A great sequel.,"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was a great sequel.the first one was a lot better,but this one is still really good.There where a lot of twistes,turns,suspence and gore.There are a lot morer killings in this one.There are also more chase sceans then the first.Ther was a really good twist near the end.Great actors and actresses made this a good movie.The scean where Julie getes in the tanning box was really nail bitting.This is a great movie you shold consider renting."
2,Mediocre at best,"This is a sequel to horror movie that wasn't even all that good (or all that scary). This is a movie with possibly the worst ending a horror movie could have. This is a movie with no suspennse, no surprises at the end. This is a movie that's main characters are so uniteresting that you find yourself hoping they'll get axed. The most interesting character in the whole film is the bartender at the hotel played by Jennifer Esposito. Of course Esposito gets little time in the film, being only a minor character. This was not the worst movie I've seen, but it is definitely near the bottom of the pile."
1,"I'm back, did I miss anything?","Hewitt is in college and trying to get on with her life when her friend wins a trip for 4 to the Bohamas. There, they and a bunch of innocent bystanders are killed one by one by the killer from part I and his son. Gets off to a great start, but falls into the rut of predictability with an overdone body count."
1,Bad movie and bad book!,"This was a horrable book and the movie was just a bad, it had bad acting, and really bad plot. If the author put more details and more plot to it, it would of been a alot better. And the movie, Brandy was a really bad actress and screamed way to much. I would NOT recommened this book to anyone"
5,Your in for a treat!,"Brilliant! Prehaps better than it's predecessor. It kept me on the edge of my seat biting my nails, I think that if you don't see this then you should be hooked. Don't miss this especially if you love blood and inappropriate use of fishing tools. NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!"
3,This movie's okay,"Main character is in college trying to forget about the events of the past year when she and a friend win a trip to the Bahamas and the killer from Part 1 enacts bloody revenge. Better than the first one, with breath taking settings and some nice cliched heavy-violence. Popcorn, pepsi and pepsi."
2,Stupid yet funny!,"This movie was really bad...but it was entertaining at the same time. It resembled ""Friday the 13th"" in just so many ways. Both have buckets of blood and gore (of course), both take place in an abandoned environment that nobody can escape, and there is a killer that slaughters people for no apparent reason. Oh, and did I mention how predictable it is? I'm just typing this to tell everyone that this movie s**ked as a warning. It's best to be viewed more for a laugh than a scream. That reminds me to tell you that ""Scream"" is a much better movie. The collector's edition is great."
1,"Hot dang, it sucked","Yeah, yeah, it was unnecessary, it was a stupid and incorrect title...forget all that. The acting is laughably abysmal, the dialogue is awful, the sequel pathetic, and the story and the movie title is pretty stupid. The movie was terrible, and debating whether or not it should be called ""I still know what you did 2 summers ago"" or ""I'm pretty sure you did something, and I killed three of your friends, which should be punishment enough, but I have a hook for a hand, and I'm gonna use it!"" just clouds the issue. This movie should not be seen by anyone who is not suffering from mental illness. OOOKKKAAAYYY, when were we supposed to be scared?"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am so disappointed that the sequel turned out so bad. I waited a whole year for this film to come out, and it ended up sucking! It is quite obvious that Ryan P. and S.M. Gellar carried the first film,(thank god they had enough sense not to stick around for the sequel)because the second film had such bad acting and ridiculous scenes!!! Like the tanning bed scene, you can't be fried to death after only being in there for 5 minutes!! How dumb does Kevin Williamson think we are??????? And hello! When did Julie become a fashion plate; she dressed like a loser in the first film, and all of a sudden the girl has taste in clothes. I don't think so!!! Also, where did she get the dough to live in that posh little apartment? Kevin if you're going to write a sequel at least make it believable."
1,I Still Don't Care What You Did Last Summer,"I am so sick of these bad horror wanna be movies that have some looser that has some special costume and special weapon. Sure, Freddy had those, but he was unique. He had character. All of these new high budget horror {laugh laugh} movies are the same. I swear when I saw this I couldn't remember if it was ISKWYDLS or Scream 2 or that other one which I have already forgotten the name of."
5,It was cool.,I think it is a great movie.My friend and I went to see it twice.Its better than the first one.
2,I Don't Care What They Did Last Summer,"The first movie was good, but this one disappoints on so many levels. Julie James and her new college friends win a free trip to the Bahamas, only to face death and plot twists when the hooked killer returns. The casting is bad (Brandy can't act - stick to music, honey). The jump-out-of-your-seat surprises are very cheap and unconvincing. And the murder scenes are not as thrilling as the previous movie. The only good points about this sequel is the funny comedy from Brandy's boyfriend and the mumbling stoner. The ending was also good, but it was much too subtle and left me unsatisfied. If you enjoy mindless, plotless slasher flicks with bad acting and heaving breasts, see it."
3,"It was way to gory,and why can't the killer die","Okay at the end Julie kills the guy and then he shows up under her bed. I mean she only shot the guy, what 7 times possibly more.And why did this guy have to make it so bloody the reason I liked the first one was because it wasn't all blood and guts like scream.So maybe next time you should think of the people with a queazy stomach."
2,More like a holiday advertisement,"Two years have passed since Julie James was tortured by her fish-hook wielding nemesis, a victim of her friends' hit and run. However, the body was never found. Still living in fear, and in college, Julie is delighted when she and her friends win a holiday to the Bahamas in a radio competition.Although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is meant to be a revenge sequel- it seems to focus more on advertising on a holiday in the Bahamas. By the end of the film, we are sick and tired of Julie's moaning and just want to see her get slashed and gashed! Yet again, the film ends with sequel potential.Question is- can we handle another Summer sequel? Or is the series tired enough as it is?I Still Know What You Did... still manages to get away with the usual horror sequel criticisms. So hopefully, producers will prevent another sequel spawning unless they want the whole saga to become one big embarrassment."
2,An [dumb] slasher.,"Jennifer Love Hewitt and her friends go to the Bahamas for a weekend of fun and sun, but the storm season holes them in and psycho killer Ben Willis is back and out to kill them all. Sequel to the middling original is very stupid (just think, the killer goes through the trouble of conning all these people to the island and decides to off not just them, but even the islanders?) and has almost no story, but remains a bit watchable thanks to the last 35 or so minutes, which features a LOT of running, gratuitous cleavage shots, and bloody slasher action. Too bad the villain is dressed in a silly fisherman's outfit."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOO,THIS IS A BAD SECOND THE ACTING WAS OKAY BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT GOT ME WHERE THEY DIDNT SHOW ENOUGH OF BRANDY OR JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS ONES BETTER PROBLY BECAUSE THIS ONES MUCH MORE GORY THAN THE FIRST WITH GUT GRINDING BLOOD AND GUTS AND THE GUY WASNT AS CREEPY AS HE WAS IN THE FIRST AND WHEN HIS MASK IS OFF IN THE FIRST ONE HE LOOKED ANGRY AND VERY CREEPY IN THIS ONE HE LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL HAPPY HUMAN BEAN SO GO SEE THE FIRST AND OVEYD THE LASR.
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would","This whole thing sucked and was just a gratuituous Jennifer Love Hewitt star vehicle, nothing more. They should have given her cleavage a separate credit -- seems she can't do anything these days without having to put her breasts on display. I'm getting sick of her."
1,"so awful, it's not worth reviewing","amazing 109 people out of 295 gave this sickening display of B-cinema uniform acting no-no's...five stars. Horrendous, exceedingly poor inception, timing, predictable, not fun, not scary, not suspensful, lacked character development, irritating and nauseating tension, if any; grade school level acting responses to often life threatening situations, freddie prinz jr is enough to make this film a one star from jumpstreet, jennifer hewiit is cute...cute, not talented, cute.The whole film is a basis of a makover of Scream which just goes to show, that anyone...ANYONE...can be famous...that is food for thought for all your theatre majors and film students.Save your money, and save your precious time, avoid this film. ""Uh, duh, uh duh,"" that is how one feels after viewing this atrocity; this mindless banter of redundant B film acting.PATHETIC. I still dont know why I watched this. I still dont know why I'm reviewing this."
1,I Wish I Didn't Know What You Did Last Summer.,"Why? Why bring such a horrible script to the screen? This is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It didn't even try to be like Scream, which may have helped. It was pretty straight forward and lame. No thrills, no suspense, no point. Did anyone bother to look over the script and attempt to refuse it? It's blatantly one of those films that was done to quickly cash in on the popularity of the previous film and current popular stars without exerting any type of effort toward making something good. Any more like this for Miss Love, and she may as well not bother with films."
3,more suspense! more gore! less originality!,"This was a lot more entertaining than the original, but it did not need to show the girls running around with their tops wide open. It took the edge off the suspense and trepidation. Freddy Prinze jr did not have a big enough part to play, and the main thing missing was Barry."
2,what the hell were the filmakers thinking?,this has got to be the worst sequel ever made. i hated the fact that it completely ignored th ending of the original. the plot did not make sense and the ending was even more ridiculous. i know... was one of the few slasher films that could have and should have stayed away from a sequel. I actually want a third in the series to tie up all the loose ends and ridiculously bad ending in this one.
1,I NEVER CARED ABOUT WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,"To quote an old, old, old saying ""EEE-GADS!"" What the heck were they thinking? The first one was bad enough, it didn't need a sequel to continue it's suckieness. Man oh man, this movie is so bad it makes me want to vomit. I rented it on blind faith, thinking ""Well, maybe, just maybe, they came up with a good plot"", and man, I wish I could get a refund for this piece of crap. And the fact that the ending is set up for a third sequel shows what idiots people in Hollywood can sometimes be. The acting is horrible, the script god-awful, and the so called ""twists"" are laughable. There was not one suspensful moment...wait, I'm wrong. The one thing that kept me in suspense was ""When the f*** will this god-awful, vomit inducing film end?"""
4,Kewl Movie,It does start out really weird cause it doesn't start from where the first left off and it didn't end which kind of sucks. Now we are going to be in suspense till they find out how to continue it cause I am sure they will.
1,"I loved the first one, but ""I still know"" was horrible!","Even though most sequels suck, this one I absolutely HATED. Thekiller will never die! I bought ""I know what you did last summer"", because it was a great movie. If Kevin Williamson wrote the story, and if they got rid of Danny Cannon, then I would actually see it twice. In the story, Ray(Freddie Prinze Jr.) just got the gun over the counter. The pawner would get sued, and Ray would be arrested. Also, when Julie shot the killer eight times with the six-round gun, the guy had to be dead! Oh my God! The scares were okay, be predictable. I always saw it coming. The only thrill was that you thought you were smart enough to figure it all out before the end! And the fake endings pissed me off, too. Thank you."
2,Waste of time,"This movie was dumb and the end was very disapointing. Doesn't that stupid fisherman ever die? Come on, they shot that guy like 6 times. There is no way he could have lived, unless he is someone like Michael Myers in Halloween. Don't waste 90 minutes of your life, do something more important."
4,SO GOOD I SAW IT TWICE IN 48 HOURS,"This movie was excellent, but I agree I could tell it was WILL, but why it was him was kinda a twisted story but then when then black dude was talking about the Son & the Daughter then I figured it out. But the ending man I loved it now was Julie dreaming or NOT???it leaves it open for another sequl(even thought I do also agree this one was a little like scream 2) but all in all I Loved this moive especially RAY..Yumm yumm and I love Jen's song that was played in it too"
4,Lived up to it's standards,"Pretty good sequal to the original. The only thing that was not good about it was the fact that it took away the mystery that the first one had. More blood, more scare, and more cleavage than the first too!"
2,Bad movie,"First of all, I like just about every movie, so giving this movie two stars should tell you just how bad it is. The only reason I gave it two stars were for Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts. They're the only thing good about ISKWYDLS."
1,"Why, oh why?","I've never even reviewed anything here but this film is just SO bad that I have to let you know..I have never wanted all the characters in a movie to die as badly as in this one. Bad acting, annoying people and no suspense of any kind, not even to mention horror.This film isn't even worth watching on TV. So do yourself a favor and do not spend your money or your time with this one."
1,This movie is a really stupid movie! TITANIC is better!,"I happen to watch this movie last night on TV and it was scary to me i asked my mom if she thought it was scary to her and she said no. So she must like that movie, but i know i didnt! I dont see why they even created this movie its so dumb. And im only 13 and on the TV it was rated TV-14. So everyone if yall dont already has this movie then DONT GET IT!"
4,fisherman fever,"how can someone survive 6 gun shots????????????? this series just like ben willis will not die. whats the next one going to be called i still still know??????? however i really enjoyed watching it. one of the most tense movies i have ever seen, it may be a bit shallow on storyline but it makes up for it with brilliant jump effects some of which are pretty predictable. If your looking for a good old fashioned frightnight you should seriously consider this one."
3,IT WAS ALRIGHT,I am a big fan of movies espeically the horror genre.. The sequel to I Know What You Did Last Summer was slightly a disappointment to me.. The first film had me on the edge of the seat the whole time providing a few jolts in my seat..The second one just didnt do the same for me .. It had a couple new twists to the story line.. that was kinda cool..Towards the end of the movie it kinda throw me .. But this time around a found myself chuckling more .. The characters arent any thing real special it got to the point for me when they got killed off i was like oh well .. If you loved the first one I suggest you to get one highly recommended .. For this one buy this one at your own risk
3,"If you loved the first,you'll love this",I still know...Pros:*Cool direction.*Good screaming skills from the actresses.Cons:*A little bit repetetive if you saw the first.The bottomline:rent it and its predecessor when you have nothing to do.
1,Pethetic!!!,"This has to be one of the stupidest movies ever. It was not scary, it was raining through the whole movie, and that Brandy got on my nerves. Acting was poor, bad plot and Jennifer Love just screams and yells to much. I would much rather reccommend the Scream Series because those are the best."
5,Bow down to Queen Jennifer,"Wow. This movie packs a wallup. I must admit though, it didn't have the same freaky mystery as in the first one. I saw this movie 3 times in the theatre. I was caught way off guard in the beginning and ending scenes. I also loved the suspense.I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I can not wit for the third, called 'I'll Always Know'(that's it, no 'What You Did Last Summer') and it's due for a summer 2000 release. Let's keep our finger crossed that it's as good as the firs two.One small favor though: Please Bring back Jim Gillespie to direct and Kevin to write. PLEASE!!!"
1,The stupidest movie to ever be made,"This as a waste of perfecly good actors. It was so stupid. It made no sense at all. The first was so much better, because Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe were in it. You felt nothing for any of the characters. I was actually rooting for the bad guy. Save your money. Freddie Prinze Jr. is hot, but it's still not worth wasting your money on this horrible sequel."
2,"Stupid, and where was Freddie?","I saw this directly after the original and thought it was more exciting than the original, but had no plot and little chemistry. I think Ryan and Sarah Michelle really helped carry the original. Hewitt was good in this movie. Despite his billing, Freddie Prinze was hardly even in the movie. I mean, they kept him offscreen most of the film and that bothered me. The first one was better!"
2,I can't believe I wasted my time!,"Not only does this movie disappoint, but it is full of flaws. First of all, this movie takes place TWO years after the accident spoken about in the title. Shouldn't it be ""I Still Know What You Did TWO Summers Ago?"" Also, the identity of the ""bad guy"" at the end was no surprise to me, seeing as I had already figured it out ten minutes into the movie. Only the one in Urban Legend was easier to spot (that was so obvious it wasn't even funny.) If you have any Geography skills whatsoever you should have no trouble figuring out a big part of this poorly made horror movie. The first one was almost as bad as this one, except it had a very surprising final scene (and Anne Heche, the only qualified actor they hired in either movie). My advice: Don't waste your time. Watch a more enthralling film like Carrie or The Exorcist."
1,Watching this makes you dumber!,"It was terrible! The writing was bad, no creativity and the most predictable garbage I have ever seen. And what high school graduate isn't going to know the capital of Brazil and if they didn't, don't you think some one is going to tell them. I wasted 90 minutes of my life for this garbage that doesn't even deserve to be a TV movie on lifetime."
3,excellent but scary????,well i was glued to my seat. I LOVED it but I must admit it was not scary at all!!! I knew who the killer was after the club scene and i was guessing the story all along!!! Excellent film though with ace effects but scary.... no way.
1,i only put a star on this peace of c**p because ihavto,first off brandy is the worst actress i have ever seen in a horror film why didnt they kill her off istead of letting her live is beyond me. this is the worst jlh movie i have ever see i hope she realizes she can make a better horror films than this she should definatly leave this series of films because it su**s monkey bars
1,Don't go there,"The original I Know what you did Last Summer was scary, suspensful, and interesting. This sequel is so bad, I don't know what I can say to caution you strongly away from it. Problem number one: There just aren't enough characters to sustain interest. Brandi, a definitely talented and charismatic actress/singer is totally wasted in her role. Jennifer Love Hewitt will grind relentlessly on your nerves, and your sympathy level for her plight will become nonexistent. Instead you will feel as if you, the viewer, are trapped on that island....and bored out of your mind."
3,It was not the BEST I've ever seen but it was OK,"I think it was pretty good and of course I especially liked the end but it wasn't the BEST. I still think Scream and Scream 2 were a lot better because it was more realistic...like some guy is actually going to cut off his hand and going to super glue a hook on to it...YEAH RIGHT! And also, they ran over the fisherman, dumped him in the water and yet he's still alive. I mean that COULD happen but it most likely wouldn't. But anywayz if you like this kinda stuff fine then but i would most definatly recommend Scream over I know what you did last summer."
3,"entertaining, but dont expect this to be scary","i really liked the first I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and even though this sequal isent scary in the slightest, it still entertains.good points:-great ending (5/5)-pretty good acting (3/5)-smart titlebad points:-the first thing you will notice in this movie is the overly dramatic music, which i think is a little over done, compared to the first-the fact that evry time someone opens a door ( for no apparent reasen)a dead body falls out. by the 3rd time im like ""dont bother, theres a dead body in there"". this gets really old by the end"
3,who really cares,this movie was a real dissapointment. i would have gave it a 2 but jlh looked really hot in it. but dont rent the movie just for her.
5,Your in for a treat!,"Brilliant! Prehaps better than it's predecessor. It kept me on the edge of my seat biting my nails, I think that if you don't see this then you should be hooked by Ben Willis (the killer) Don't miss this especially if you love blood and inappropriate use of garden tools. NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!"
2,"not bad, but pointless....and what's with the ending?","this has got to be the most pointless sequel ever made.I hated the fact that it completely ignored the ending of the original. the plot did not make sense and the ending was even more ridiculous than the entire movie. I know what you did last summer was one of the few slasher films that could have and should have stayed away from a sequel. I actually want a third in the series to tie up all the loose ends and ridiculously bad ending in this one. Not bad as a slasher pic, but pretty pointless sequel...."
1,If you hated the first...,"this one's even worse! Brandy is a non-actor who acts in this film (she's not even good by sitcom standards) and Jennifer Hewitt is a non-singer who sings in this film. And, whattaya know, there's more killing! Wow!! Like Friday the 13th without the cult appeal. Enjoyable only by 17 year olds able to legally get into an R rated movie by themselves for the first time. What this movie lacks in creativity, it makes up for in spades with sheer tedium. Watch your dog sleep instead."
3,"Okay, could've been better","The acting sucked, so did the story (they got rid of Kevin Williamson) but it was okay. It wasn't scary, and it was predictable, but it was cute, and had a few good sequences. It was a little funny but Brandy sucked alot. It was okay, nothin special, could've been better"
3,The movie was terrible?,As the movie lacked it had a great cast! Brandy proved that she could scream and even kick some fisherman ass! Jenn Love came back as the always paranoid Julie James and was actually preety good! The original was diffently better! The other good thing about this film besides the cast is the soundtrack!
1,What crap,"Please if you think this is good horor then you dont know what good horror is, this movie along with the first one and even all of the Scream movies are garbage any real fan of cult horror or real horror will tell you dont wste your money. Real horror is made from the start of the first night of the living dead 1968 till about late 80's then from there horror quit is not wat it use to be. "" I know what you did last summer "" is not good AT ALL"
2,This really deserves one star.,"Stupid writing, OTT direction, irritating music, patently obvious sequel-set-up/it's-all-a-dream ending... absolutely dreadful. Only gets a second star because of the gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt (and because she sings on the soundtrack)."
2,Weird and Corny but JLH lokked real pretty,"Okay I think this movie is okay but it is really weird!I have 4 reasons1.That Will guys is too perky and never worried how dumb you know he's part of it 2.The killer kills everyone in the hotel i mean when you watch it look there is 5 people working for the hotel or around the hotel not in cluding Ti , and all those people die! 3.The killer gets shot a bazillion times and never dies! 4.Will Benson Get it Will Ben's son SOMEONE CALL THE CORNY POLICE! 5.Will is a freakin dummy!"
4,A Thriller to be Seen!,I was sitting on the edge of my seat when I saw the sequal. It was a littler more dull then the first but with more gore. I really enjoyed the endingand recomend it to anyone looking for a thriller to watch with their friends.
2,read please,this movie isnt all that scary or doesnt have near the suspence as the originol. I would of given it one star but that one scene with jennifer love hewitt in the tanning box is to good not to give a star so that is really the only reason to rent this movie
2,Ben WiLLIS - the new joke of the horror genre ...,"well, what to say about this trash other than ""Don't waste your time watching it like I did !! """" Movies like this are responsible for the bad reputation sequels generally have !! Irc !! Only Jennifer is amazingly pretty here, the rest is a screenplay so bad that the producers must be laughing until now ..."
1,HORRIBLE,"Even if you watch this as a comedy, you'll feel bad. You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this lousy sequel. Jennifer is amazingly pretty, is the only point worthwhile watching. The end was a bad joke. If they are trying to turn the killer Will into another Jason, Freddy or Myers, it won't suceed."
3,this movie was decent but at the same time it sucked,"okay what i mean is*SPOILER ALERT*It was a decent slasher film. It has some thrills and chills, running, suspense and all that good stuff. The acting wasnt bad though mehki pheiffer got on my nerves but that wasnt him it was his character was obnoxious. i was actually waiting on him to die so he would shut up. Jack Black was a nice suprise.heres what i hated about it. It was predictable and over done but the worst, the absolute worst part is that ben willis suddenly became immortal. The different thing about ben willis is that he was a real guy who could be killed they just didnt pull it off. They killed him though. Bullet ridden and you know what at the end i knew they were gonna do it. i knew they were gonna bring him back and they did. Let the killer die and get a new idea writers. Be creative, come up with something new because by the end of the second sequel if you dont let it go, it just gets pethetic."
5,A Great Slashing Horror Film!!,This is a great movie I loved it it was so scary and slinging slashing horror film. It's way better than the first one I thought it wasn't going to be better than the first one but I was totally wrong. Brandy is hot in it she's a good actress in this to. Julie and her friends Carla Ty and her boyfriend Ray. They go to stay at a motel and their all by themself's and then he follows them to the motel and then instead of having a hook to carry he has a hook for a hand in this one. It is much scarier than the first one you've got to buy this movie.
1,The Movie was terrible,"If you thought the first was bad, then try sitting through the second one. The cast was great but the movie it self sucked badly. I mean, why can't the killer die and never come back? I mean the people in Holly wood want to keep movies going on forever so that they can make more money, like in children of the corn they made like five movies of the same thing. If only they could make one movie with out a squal. But I guess they just don't know when to quit."
2,No-where near as good as the first,"Unlike Scream 2 this film fails to live up to the amazing original film. It was un scary, predictable, poorly acted {apart from Love and Freddie Prinze}, and the screenplay was horrendous! It was not humourous in the least and where it did try to be it failed miserably. The best scene in the whole movie is the car scene when Ray and his friend are singing along to White Snake. The killing scenes where a direct copy from the first one most of the time, using the same kind of effects to achieve the scares. It's just this time they didn't work!"
2,"Not a bad DVD, but even Hewitt can't save the film","Let's face it, Jennifer Love Hewitt is a fox. But as for the movie, there's too much gore and not enough scares. Features aren't as great as they are made out to be on the box... a few trailers, a short (5-10 min.) and greatly disappointing featurette that is really just an extended plug for the movie, and the music video for Hewitt's ""How do I deal"". Rent this one."
2,completely unnecessary remake,"This film, like so many others out there, did not score too high on my list. Full of too much violence and profanity, it will leave the viewer feeling like a voyeur after too many glimpses into Hewitt's character's life."
1,This was supposed to be scary?,"In this terrible follow-up from the smash hit ""I know what you did last summer"" 4 teens are lost on an island somewhere with a killer chasing them. If you ask me, the only thing that was ""lost"" in this film was a plot. It was such a pathetic attempt at trying to live up to the first one that they should just leave it alone. There is way too much blood and gore in this movie which turned it off to alot of viewers. Thank god Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe bit it in the first one because even they couldn't save this movie from utter disaster."
1,And that is 1 star too many,"I am a horror fanatic and was excited to see this follow-up to a pretty decent ""I Know What You Did.."" To say I was disappointed is an understatement. First of all, it should have been titled ""I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago"" or something. Secondly, this trash had more holes in it than Swiss Cheese. Third, it wasn't scary at all, just stupid. They tried to add twists, but they were very weak and dumb. The only people who liked this movie are NOT true horror fans and probably haven't hit puberty!"
2,I Don't Know What You Were Thinking When You Made This Film.,"This sequel to the film I Know What You Did Last Summer was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It not only took an intelegent suspence-thriller (I Know) and change it into a splatter moive (I Still Know), but it completly ignored the ending of the original, and changed the characteristics of the killer. If this film continues to produce sequels it will become the Halloween of the '90's. One good film followed up by poorly made sequels (excluding Halloween H20). It is tragic to see the curse of the sequel bad returning to the horror genre."
2,"Come back, Sarah Michelle!","This sad sequel to the original had a few exciting moments, but they were few and afr between. But almost all of the characters got on my nerves, and the horror scenes were rather lame anyway. Luckily at the end it picked itself up...a little. But it definitely makes you miss Ryan Phillipe and especially Sarah Michelle Gellar, the best actors and characters from the original. Is it just me or is the fisher guy not scary at all anymore? And what's with the title? I personally think I STILL KNOW is a better title all by itself, leaving off the long end."
3,JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT rulez!,"This average movie is not as well as the first part, which was really cool. But: Jennifer Love Hewitt looked fantastic (again). She simply is wonderful! Hey, if u r such a big JLH-fan than me, send me a mail (andreas.althammer@kronach.baynet.de) and let's talk about her. If you can't reach me now, try it a little later...i'm online soon!"
1,Definitely not worth your trouble,"OK. This is one film that should never have been made. For starters, the film crew lost control of their weather switch, there's too much unbelievable gore, and the acting is just, well, fake. You barely have enough time to get to know each of the characters intimately before they get killed, which is just as well because I didn't feel anything when they died. To quote from Scream 2, 'sequels are inferior films' - Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr in the original were far superior actors. So save $15 and a lot of trouble."
3,NOT SCARY AT ALL LIKE IT'S FIRST MOVIE!!!!!!!,"Now, Julie and her new friend{Brandy} head off to a tropical islands resort with two other friends. Once they're there, they realize that Julie's hook wielding friend is back!!!!!!! This movie was so not scary, unlike the first!!!! It was good, but not great!!!!!"
2,too much like the original,"it was too much like the original oh come on we know the same killer is on the loose after the same girl and with the same wepon the only difference is different area, group of freinds and another killer this movie is also too much like scream ( the director has a one way mind )"
2,"Not good, but funny","OK. The first one was great, MUCH better than this one. This movie is pretty bad, but it's really funny! I love how the killer is so incredibly NOT SCARY in this movie. He's hilarious! Oh, and the best characters died in the first movie, so I was cheering him on the whole time, since I hate Julie and Ray. If you haven't seen this movie and you liked the first one, you might not want to see this atrocity because it might ruin IKWYDLS. And the ending is stupid in this movie."
2,Better than the First 'Summer',"Julie James is back with Brandy, not the drink. They go on vacation to the Bahamas, but boo-hoo! It's raining over there. Throw in Jack Black as a Jamaican plant expert. Better. ""Find another jacuzzi,"" says Karla's (Brandy) boyfriend to an unwanted visitor. ""It's all good,"" says the expert. The fisherman is back and hungrier than ever. His hand is now the hook! Wow! He pulls a double shift on the lodge and the teenagers. A bartender lady is tough, whoa, and a sneaky bellboy who's 60 years-old, steals toothbrushes. Whatever. Guys will enjoy this if they like Hewitt. Overall, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" is way too long of a title for me to type, funnier than the first, Julie looks healthy, and Jack Black was thrown into the mix! Decent, but still lacking any intelligence."
3,The first was better.,"The sequal to I know What You Did Last Summer is unfortunatly not nearly as great as the first one.In this movie Julie(Jennifer Love Hewitt)is in college and is just not doing to well.Boyfriend troubles,not doing too well in school,still haunted by what happened the previous summer,etc.One morning her roomate,Karla(played by Brandy),gets a call from a radio station and wins a trip to the Bahama's.Little do these friends know is there is an unwelcome visitor waiting for them on this island.The movie starts out very promising,but drags out in to another slasher sequal.The twist in the end was very well done.There were a few suspencful scenes.But the movie also had some holes,draggy pointes,and a horrid and very predictable ending.The acting wasn't nearly as good as the it was in the first.Freddie Prinze Jr.didn't do all that great and I expected a little better from Brandy.All in all I say give this movie a try,but don't expect it to be better than the first one."
4,The whole series is good,Danielson has a real knack for taking stories from the Old Testament and weaving them into the history of the time. The books are like potato chips - you can't eat just one.
4,No sheath,"Docking one star due to product description. It says ""genuine leather sheath"", but Estwing doesn't make a sheath for this product. It doesn't really need one because it isn't intended to be very sharp."
5,Awesome Tool!,"This axe makes the chore of splitting firewood enjoyable! It easily broke up one of the hardest pieces of timber I've ever ran into while camping. Get a good swing on it, and one strike is common. Simply an awesome tool.The edge is very sharp when it arrived, and it held the edge well only requiring a few quick passes over a stone to maintain it. This is probably the best purchase I have made yet for our latest passion of camping.Its heavy though, so if you are weight conscious that is probably something you would want to look at closely."
5,Versatile tool,"I don't have much else to say that's already been in previous reviews. The size of this tool is perfect for when I go camping, and the maul end can be used to pound in tent stakes. The tool is crafted from a single piece of metal, so there are no components that may become loose or significantly damaged. The head weighs four pounds, so when I use it to split wood, I basically just ""drop"" the head onto the wood; as opposed to swinging the tool over my head as I would an axe or hatchet."
2,No sheath was included: DANGEROUS!,"I haven't used it yet... but how am I supposed to transport this heavy sharp thing safely? The Product Description says a Genuine Leather Sheath is included, but mine was wrapped in bubble wrap."
3,FRIENDS,"This is my most favorite sitcom. I do not usually like comedy but this one suits me very well. I can see why some people wouldn't like it. However, it fits my personality very well.In a way Monica, Rachel, Phoebe ( the girls. ) Ross, Chandler, and Joe ( the guys. ) Have a yin and yang relationship to each other.Some times the story lines do get dull and they really are dragged out. However, on a whole this is one of my favorite series.Really good comedy for most of the seasons."
1,only goes to show...,"...some people will buy any piece of junk. Think of it. 6 seasons of insipid jokes by a bunch of excessively overpaid and under-talented actors playing people who you wouldn't want to be caught dead on the same continent with-- let alone in the same apartment! On the other hand, the one saving grace is that this is not a reality show---in fact, it's as far from anything involving real people as you can get.This is the ""best comedy"" ever made? Boy, has the American public's taste sunk!!!"
4,There are more episodes coming,"If you wanted each DVD as it came out, this would have been the way to go. You would have saved a few bucks buying it all in one pack like this.But with the show coming to an end, I am hoping they will come out with everything all on one boxed set. That would be worth waiting for.But if you need them now, this purchase would be your best bet."
1,Not For Everyone,"Personally, I didn't care for this book one bit. Yes, it is very very researched and detailed. That I will not argue. But it is not easily comprehenable and it makes me think of people who use big words and odd turns of phrase to sound smarter. I found many of the details to be inconsequential to the subject matter and some sections required outside research and re-reading to even understand.As an aspiring college history professor, I will definately not recommend this book to my students or use any of it in my lectures/reading."
2,Her Older Books Are Better,"The 1st couple chapters were great, and then the book takes a turn for the worst. She starts ranting about the letters she receives, and makes very condescending and judging remarks about people. The comparisons to nature start becoming contrived and you really start to get the feeling that she's become some crazy old lady who has lost touch with the world. I got about 2/3 of the way through the book and couldn't read it any longer. She has much better books than this one!"
2,Not her best,I have read and loved all of her other books and was disgusted with this one. Her tone was getting close to condescending and she lectured on ad nauseum over concepts she has talked about a lot before. She brought up a few interesting topics but that was about it. I could barely make it through the book.
3,"Ballet 101, A Beginner's Class","Good to practice to as a supplement to a beginner's ballet class. She takes on a lot, so it is good to pause between steps that are presented."
1,What a disgrace to the Mortal Kombat name!,"This is absolute crap! Everything about this film sucks.Terrible acting,Ridiculous dialog,Bad fight scenes...and what's worse is this is supposed to be a ""Mortal Kombat"" movie! The characters are just so cheesy looking along with the rest of this god awful nightmare.I wasn't too pleased with the first film,except for Bridgette Wilson as Sonya *whistle whistle* ;) lol but that movie was ALOT better than this waste of time.If you HAVE to watch an MK movie,than pick up the original and avoid this dvd like a flu bug!"
3,Mortal Kombat!!,"Well I thought this movie was ok, but I didn't think it was as great as the first one. One thing that bothered me was that the original Rayden,Sonya,and Johnny didn't show up! But, I like the new Rayden and Sonya, they played their parts very well. Rayden actually gets to fight in this movie. I thought it sucked when Johnny was killed off in the 5 minutes of the film. Kitana fights in this movie too, which was pretty awsome becuase she used her fans! Sonya and Mileena fight in mud, so I bet the guys really loved that. My favirote character was Jax, he had a few lines that I thought were funny. My favirote line in this movie was when Sonya was talking to Lui Kane, ""I can't believe you lost Kitana and then picked her up!"" referring to Jade. If they plan on making a third film hopefully their special affects will be better in the next one. I give this film 3 stars."
1,original is far better then this crapheap,what the hell is up with this one. this one has James Remar as Raiden...Christopher Lambert was better then him and Remar getting a buzzcut wasnt special. though the part where Sonya Blade gets all down in the mud is hot. Brian Thompson sucks. Robin Shou is wasted and killing Johnny Cage at the beginning sucked. a crappy sequel to a good movie.
1,Horrible in every possible way...,"They screwed up here. What else is there to say? This completely terrible sequel picks up where the pretty good first one left off and propels us into a land of... power ranger dialogue, campy violence, and cheesy special effects. This movie is worse than ""Double Dragon."" The fight scenes are amazingly bad, the music is annoying and the overall look of the movie is like someone barfed on it. Completely ruined what could have been an awesome martial arts series."
1,Didn't like it,"I did not like this movie at all. The special effects don't make up for the weak plot. I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat movie, but this movie was like torture for me to sit through the whole thing."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"Saw this uncut on the tube and laughed so hard at the special effects, dialogue, and of course acting than any film in my life. Takes itself way to serious. Good for a gag gift or just to make fun of. HORRIBLE..In the top 5 of the worst films I've ever seen."
3,"pretty stupid, and horrible new cast","the first Mortal Kombat was pretty awsome, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, even though it has a pretty awsome name, is a pretty terrible movie.first of all, just about every character from the first Mortal Kombat is gone, with the exception of Lu Kang and Kitana.everyone other character from the first is gone. Johnny Cage, Sonya, Jax, and Raiden are all plaid by different characters.then, to top it off, it's to corny. the final fight scene is stupid. instead of going toe to toe like they did in the first Mortal Kombat, they go with their animality which is stupid.the whole movie got ruined when they changed the cast members around, and the movie is just stupid.not really good fight scenes like in the first one.okay if you like Mortal Kombat, but the first one is the best one."
3,It's a bad sequel!,"Well where should I start.These are all the bad things about the movie.They picked the wrong people to replace these characters.They replaced Rayden,Jax,Sonya,Cage,and more.These actors are ok but they dont even remind me of the first.Also this is supposed to have a tornement in it.Not just running and fighting along the way.The actor that played Lui Kang said he was very dissapointed.The special effects were ok.But Smoke has the wrong powers.He has Sectors powers instead.The fights just look so fake.I mean that you can see that their not even hitting each other.There is barley any funny parts because of johnny having one line and then dying.Now what is wrong with that!But the good thing is that Rayden finally fights but is just like 2 min.The first 2 min of the movie is good but then goes crazy!I would rent this movie first but then deside if you want it or not...."
2,The ultimate Mortal Kombat film? I don't think so...,"When I saw ''MORTAL KOMBAT'', directed by Paul Anderson, I adored the movie. So I thought that the next movie, ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'', would be the ultimate Mortal Kombat film. But I was wrong. The prequel of this movie is far better, and the actor that plays Rayden in this movie ... for the role. So what we have here is: Some bad cast, some bad special effects, and a boring storyline. Watch this movie only if you don't have anything else to do, or if you are nine years old, and younger."
1,Why would anybody like this?,"This is probably one of the worst ""films"" ever made, period. At least the first MK movie was tolerable...this one is a complete joke. I think the goal of the script was to fit in every possible character from the video games, even if they were only there for a few seconds. Every interesting turn that the movie could have taken was completely lost by the insane number of these pointless cameos. They in no way added to the movie. Apparently those involved in the making of this film forgot about two key things that tend to help movies out: plot and acting. The horrible CG of the climactic (and yet again, pointless) dragon battle at the end is worth watching simply because it will give you something to complain about for the rest of your life."
3,Okay...,"The first movie was definitely better. This sequel came out in theatres, but it definitely felt more like a direct-to-video film. Some people might like this movie, and I did think some parts were good, but overall this is a very average B film that is better viewed on television than bought. If you like the Mortal Kombat video games, it's debatable whether you'll like this or not."
2,MK Anhilation review part 2 part 1 on mortal kombat I/mortal kombat II DVD reviews 5.5/10,"Continuing, When Cage is killed. When Jax asks Sonya who Johnny is Sonya never responds. it's like the 1st movie didn't matter. James Remer is ok but not great like Chris Lambert's Raiden. Jax was ok & Kitana 1 of the characters with the strongest dialog from the 1st movie in this you don't care if she lives or dies. Is the movie God awful h** no I can tell you it's half decent & it's watchable. 10-15 minutes of build up then 2-5 minutes of fight scenes the soundtrack is good again & the story somewhat follows the MK 3 storyline. So not a good sequel but it's watchable I got better things to say about Anhilation than the live action Street Fighter movies or that Double Dragon crap the Mario Movie. You know imagine if Uwe Boll directed this how bad it would have been plus John R Leonetti had no credibility as a director."
3,"Good, but too many Kombatants","I watched this last night with a friend, and I liked it, but it's not the best. First, the way Cage died was so weak, and second, there were too many characters. Cyrax, Nightwolf, Jade, Sheeva, and Smoke had bit parts. Don't get me wrong I like this movie it is just a sit-back-and-watch movie, but some of the characters didn't get to fight. Overall, a goofy action movie, but slim down the cast.PS Bring back Reptile!!!"
1,THE MOST POPULAR BAD FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I know that there are some Cannon Films Golan-Globus movies that worked on making bad low budget films, but this movie is not even low budget and it has the reputation of being the worst movie ever made! Infact there are people that ask themselves ""Is there a movie any worst that this?"".I will not say why this film is SOOOOOO bad because everybody knows the answer. The reason that I wrote this is because I hate this movie!!!ADIOS!"
1,AVOID,"A horrible movie. Not even fans of the game will like this one. The first movie was good, but the sequel falls incredibly short. It tried to leap across the Grand Canyon with two broken legs and no safety net. Bad, i know, i'll stop now. Horrible acting and a terrible plot, however it is the dialogue that does this movie in. ""Grrrr.....how'd you like that? Grrr....that was my....Animality....grrrrr"". Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you saw the first one and you need a sequel, go to your local arcade and play the game itself."
1,The actors can't....The special effects arn't.,"Even by Computer-game-movie standards this is at the bottom of the barrel. It has the worst special effects ever. There not even special effects, there just effects. The end fight looks like the Japanese Godzilla movies. The acting is Pitiful. (James Ramar is the only one who makes it out without egg on his face) This film really feels like it doesn't even have a director, It is that bad. Trust me... Don't see it."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This Movie is the worst of all, the games are fantastic but this movie is not worth a peany. They forgot what really is Mortal Kombat and is a game of alot of blood and vailence and this movie have nothing of it. What happend to the producer of this movie? I hope if they ever redo all of the mortal kombat films that they put them all R and not PG-13. Sorry for my english =)"
2,Oh My God,"You know, this movie would not be so bad if its characters had a point. Yes, there are a load of characters from the MK3 game, but they don't explain where they come from, their significance in the plot, why the heck they're there! The dialog is as choppy as the plot, and I don't even know where the whole animality thing came from without reference to the games!!! The coolest characters in the movie were Jax, NightWolf, and that's just about it. AND JOHNNY!!! =(You know how sometimes you could just watch a movie and go ""ugh... this is so bad""... this is one of them. I was very disappointed, considering how good the first one was."
2,pure crap,"I wish I could give this movie 1 and a 1/2 stars. The only things good about this film was the fight between jax and sonya vs cyrax. other than that, the soundtrack was the only thing that kept this movie alive. why was sheeva even IN this movie if technically all she does is run her mouth? the crappiest fight scene in my opinion was sonya vs mileena. and what was up with that monster that jax was punching in the @$$? well, whatever. i can understand why linden ashby backed out of the role in the 2nd film cause he knew he was gonna be killed off. and james remar is MAJOR p*ssy in this movie, must i go into more details here?"
4,"Un-named characters, but great music and fight sequences.","MK 2 is a little better than the first Mortal Kombat, but only in terms of action. There is not 5 minutes when these guys start fighting again. This movie takes place seconds after the first one, which is not a good idea. Only two actors return (Soto and Shou) and all the others are replaced. Linden Ashby, the guy who played Johnny Cage, should have returned, even if Johnny Cage is in it for 2 minutes (You'll see what I mean). The music was fantastic, and the fight sequences are great. They could make a million of these movies!"
1,Worst Video Game-turned Movie sequel ever.,"There is absolutely nothing good about this movie. Too many characters, many of whom (Rain, Sheeva, Kabal, Stryker, and more) die before doing anything, some before even being seen! Very low quality, obviously fake special effects, and low budget. Example: When Liu Kang knocks Barraka into the fire, if you have good eyes or a freeze-frame DVD, you can see, plain as day, that it's Rain being knocked into the fire. They used the scene where Shao Khan kills Rain again to save money. I can go on, like when Raiden is about to fight the three ninjas, but only fights two, or when they don't even use a stunt-man with the same color hair as Raiden. In short: This movie SUCKS."
1,Sequels suck big time!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The first one was ""tongue-in-cheek"" kung-fu/action that even the makers didn't take seriously. The actors in the original Mortal Kombat looked goofy, but it was obvious they were having a good time. Here they just came for their paycheck.And if you thought there was no story in the first one, you will not be able to sit through the sequel... Dumb, stupid, unfunny!""Annhilation"" is obviously solely a producers' idea to milk more money from us. Don't let them!"
1,Power Rangers on crack invade the Land of Make-Believe,"Unfortunately the filmmakers didn't have the cheat codes for a coherent storyline. This jumbled mess of a movie is filled with more laughable/irrelevant elements than a congressional budget plan, only with fewer special effects.If you have any respect for your brain, do not watch this movie. Video taping yourself play TETRIS or having a tax audit would be more enjoyable (and interesting)."
1,....................,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK*This movie sucks. Not gonna sugarcoat it. This movie sucks. Bad. I quite liked the first Mortal Kombat movie, I thought it was great, and I had hoped that this sequel would be great too! Oh man, it wasn't, not even close. For one, one of the main, central characters dies in the first two minutes of this movie, and they couldn't even keep all the actors/actresses for the roles (I think they only kept two?)! The story was much more confusing and harder to follow, the actors/actresses they got to replace the original ones were, um, bad... Okay, won't sugarcoat that either, they were awful. The effects actually seemed worse than those of the first movie. Really, this move is the reason I wished the first MK movie hadn't ended in a cliffhanger, because this movie sucks. Badly. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,The movie sucks,"The visual effects were horrible, the characters weren't that greatly brought onto the screen. For example, Motaro in the movie was a scrawny guy as when you're playing the game, he's muscular and actually looks much better. At parts, the story in the second movie leaves the audience thinking ""Was the director high when he wrote the script for this?"""
1,"Yeah, it IS a load of #$%&","I'm glad that my cousins rented this movie instead of buying it. This is nothing but a puddle of pig urine. The script is horrible, the special effects look unrealistic, and many of the characters are annoying as hell. Don't get me wrong, this sequel had lots of potential. Too bad no one knew how to make it as good as the original.Grade: F"
1,Sucky MK,This Movie takes a big flaming tird on the MK series I mean How could Ed Boon let them do this. This Movie suck's dont ever watch it. It has Power ranger fighting and the cast stinks. The First one is the best!
1,Mortal Kombat 2 Two thumbs down (LOGO) SMK,"This movie (...), I don't get it? Johnny cage dies at the beginning what's with that? (...)plot too doesn't make sense. Very corny for another thing. If I were you I would never watch this movie and I mean never! If you would like to know if I have any other reviews look for my logo which is SMK that should be at the top or bottom of my review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK"
1,This is the worst sequel I have ever seen,I enjoyed the first movie but this one was terrible. The effects were less than satisfactory and the story line was weak. It seemed like they were trying to make this movie for a very young audience and the fight sceens seemed more like power rangers action than martial arts. I do not recomend this movie.
3,Could have been better,"Well im a die hard Mortal Kombat fan, i thought they had enough characters They destroyed rayden . They tried to shove the the story of mk2 and mk3 together but it just wasnt working...part 3 will be better im sure."
1,Insidepulse Movies - Mike Noyes,"When a movie is based on a video game like Mortal Kombat you really can't expect too much. If you're a fan of the games all you can really hope for is that they do your favorite characters justice and that the fight scenes are really good. If you're not a fan it's just the latter. However, Annihilation, the 1997 sequel, offers neither of these things. The tagline on the case reads ""Destroy all expectations"" and that is exactly what this film does, though probably not in the way it was intended.Read the rest of my review here:"
1,Its craptacular,"This movie is a perfect example of why most sequels suck and you should never make a movie based on a game. Dont get me wrong, I loved the first movie. But about everything about this sequel was horrible. The acting, the lines, the costumes, the lack of use of chracters.I looked over the film and did find one good thing...well two if you count when it ended. The theme was the only good thing. I mean who casted Shao Kahn? I have crap thats bigger then him. Kahn is suposed to be huge and menacing...the guy they got was puny.Oh dont get me started with the acting. In possibly the worst movie line ever...was uttered in this film.Kitana: Mother you're alive?!Sindel: Too bad *you*... will DIE!MK most famous characters were barely in the movie. Scorpion and Sub Zero only appeared for like 5 minutes.Skip this movie, I dont care if you love the game or the first movie.Pros:-The theme-The end credits (thank god it was over)Cons:-Acting-Lack of chracters-Costumes-Lines"
2,Too many characters,"There were far too many characters in this second movie as well as a half brained soundtrack. Rather than the first movie being about good vs. evil this is more like a Mad Max type movie where Kang, Blade, Jax, Rayden and the new Sub are set to roam the outworld. Fighting whomever comes. Lots of people come too because this movie covers MK2 and MK3, causing there to be 30 second fights. Then the last fight of the movie is a three on three battle which causes you to start getting into one fight and then they cut to another pair of people fighting, it is like watching a high budget Power Rangers."
2,disappointment,"First they didn't bring back the original Rayden, Sonya, or Johnny. then they killed Johnny without even kissing Sonya. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment."
2,disappointment,"First they didn't bring back the original Rayden, Sonya, or JOhnny. then they killed Johnny without even kissig Sonya. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment."
1,Save your money,Please don't buy this movie. It really is as bad as so many of the other reviewers have said.
2,CRAPPY FUN!,"... I had fun with it the second time. All you need to do isnot expect a BIG SMASH HOLLYWOOD FILM! Just expect the basics:fighting, effects, and some new characters. When I watched the movie the second time, I had a little bit of fun! So I hope these expectations can lead you to a kinda fun time. Like the movie says ""DESTROY ALL EXPECTATIONS! "" END"
3,ANNIHILATE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"I know sequels are rarely as good(or better) than the original, but this sequel was a disgrace to movie-making! The plot is fairly unoriginal. The script is filled with crude language and lame jokes! And the special effects are horrible! So why am I giving this move 3 stars? 01: The music is from Megadeth, Rammstein, KMFDM, and other great artists. 02: The lovely ladies 03: The cool DVD extras"
3,Movie was good but not as a good as the first mortal kombat,"This movie seemed rushed and looked like they tried to get every character in the movie even if it was for a few seconds. When this movie came out, mortal kombat was played out and no one really cared about it anymore."
2,"Good Fights, NO PLOT","Let me start out saying to those who will end up reading this if you ever think of getting this movie. Only get this if your sitting home on a Saturday afternoon, with nothing on TV, you don't have a girlfriend or wife to be with, or have a slick car to drive. I bought this movie because I just like to sit in front of the TV and not think sometimes. Let me say outright this movie helps you do just that. The plot is totally incosequential. Watch the movie to see people whomping on each other if your looking for a movie that has a plot and follows the Mortal Kombat style. Watch the first one it will do you better. This one was worth it to me as I just like to veg out. The movie's campy plot will leave you wondering why you paid for this movie. So just wait for it on cable. But, if you ever just wanna kill time. Buy this movie. I leave it up to you."
1,Describing this movie in one word is easy.,"CRAP! This is basically nothing more than an hour and a half advertisement for a game! The characters fly on the screen and are gone the next! I swear the director had a checklist of every character that he had to use! (OK OK, next scene we gotta put this dude in, a lot of kids like him..........OK print it, he's in the movie, next!)The fights were ridiculous and whatever morphing techniques they used were like campy 50's sci-fi. Like I said, this movie was an advertisement. Play the game and you've seen the movie."
1,Don't Bother,"I really enjoyed the first movie, but this follow-up was less than adequate. My first beef with the movie is the failure to use some of the characters effectively. When some characters were used, unless you played the game you had no idea who they were because they didn't name them in the movie. Some guy would just jump out and you wouldn't know who they were and they'd be gone in a flash. Plus some usage was pointless like SubZero, Scorpion, and NightWolf. Also some of the cut scenes were too choppy. Not enough real scenery was used and the created stuff was very lo tech. My last problem was the untimely demise of Johnny Cage. This was just pointless and stupid. It was a real waste of a good character especially after everything they went through in the first movie. Overall I was very disappointed and the acting wasn't that great to begin with. Please save your money and stay away from this one."
2,YAWN!,"Mortal Kombat annilation is not as nearly as good as the first,the actting is really bad and it is not the same without the real,rayden,jax,sonya,and johnny cage it makes the movie alot different and does' even seem like a sequeal.The music and fighting is better but in the end this movie seems to childish and hi-tech then the first"
1,lame,"this movie is not worth the star I was forced to give it. No plot, and they didn't go in enough with any of the charectors, especially Sub-Zero."
2,THE GAME HAD BETTER ACTING,This film was a flop from the origanal and the new cast that replaced soyna and rayden were terrible. The characters were also bad. You would see maybe just enough of certain fights to meet a character or two from the sequal games but they were just crammed in the movie and then dissapeared before you could blink. The ending fight scene was also terrible and the animorphs were just corny. I was hopeing to see some hard hitting martial arts like the first when Liu and Reptile battled it out but most of the cast had no real impressive skills.
1,"Man, this movie sucks!","This movie was a letdown in every possible way. Bad acting (not to mention many of the original actors are not in it), cheesy fight sequences, cheap effects, and most of all, terrible plot. Even if you are obsessed with the games, the storyline of this movie can become almost unintelligible at times. Not to mention the fact that many of the characters (such as Shiva or Motaro) looked awful. Remember Goro from the original? There is an example of a well done monster; huge, mean, and intimidating. The monsters in this movie just look ridiculous. And finally, what's the deal with killing Johnny Cage in the first five minutes of the movie? Common! It's just not Mortal Kombat without Johnny Cage! However, I would highly recommend the first one. The original was well choreographed, entertaining, and had a suprisingly good plot. Just don't waste your time on this sequel."
1,Where is the plot?,"""Mortal Kombat-Annihilation"" had spectacular previews and hype surrounding it as it was the sequel to the motion picture incarnation of the most successful videogame of all time. Unfortunately, upon sscrutinizing the movie, I learned how decietful hype can be. Stereotyped characters (or just symbolic representations of them used for the initiation of fight sequences--which take up virtually all of the movie--) and terrible acting don't help raise the movie's status. The motion picture has very weak CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) as well as virtually no plot. At one point, the filmmakers attempt a subplot but give it up without an explanation."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !,"I have to say that the 1st MK movie was not bad...but this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Bad acting, different actors and actresses who can't even act!, bad special FX and it has more plot hole than a spagetti strainer!"
1,Even worse than the first movie!,"Horrible story, horrible acting, horrible music, ridiculous plot. In those aspects, it's just like the first film. BUT, the special effects were horrible and the fight scenes were completely boring and uninspired. In those aspects it doesn't even live up to the first movie. Did I mention the horrible acting? Oh I did, but really, it was even worse than the first movie's and the first movie's was VERY BAD! The cast is filled with ex body builders, ex porn stars and second rate martial arts movie stars whose performances just make you want to laugh. By far one of the worst movies ever made! Steer clear! Even if you're a diehard fan of the video games, this movie just might kill your devotion to anything having to do with Mortal Kombat."
1,"""Flawless victory."" Yeah, right.","This movie has more plot holes than Swiss cheese. Where did those velosospheres come from? Jax was just a brief cameo in the first movie, so why did he get those cybernetic arms in the meantime? Sub-Zero had a brother, and why did he dissapear right after his fight with Scorpion? Why did Jade double-cross the group? And animalities? Give me a break. As someone who knows a smattering of the Mortal Kombat mythology (thanks to a dangerously in-depth article posted at GameSpot) this movie was just plain awful. Bad acting, cheesy effects, deplorable writing, and plot holes big enough to throw Jade's spear through without hitting the sides. Avoid this movie."
4,ROUND TWO.....FIGHT!,"Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a fun ride. Many critics out there say this movie blows, which isn't true. People who havent played any of the games are confused at the story line and sorts. Sure the voice actin' could use a little work but who cares, the action is where its all about in kung fu flicks. I enjoyed both the 1st and 2nd film, there are tons of charaters from the games included in this movie, should please alot of the many gamers out there looking for there favorite charater appreances. There is also rumors of the next MK film in the works. I cant wait!Out-standing..."
1,"Round 2 FIGHT! Winner: Any other movie, Loser: This one.",You know if they had the smae actor who played Raiden I would've given this movie 2 stars. MK2 immediatley starts out with action. And in 5 minutes Johnny Cage's head is gone. MK2 is one of the worst movie's I have ever seen. People die too fast and die stupidly. For example Sheeva dies with a cage falling on her. Now I beleive that in MK1 all the fighters die from another person. And whats with this new homie look that Raiden gets??!! You'd have more fun playing Street Fighter than see this movie.
1,The video game is much fun that this movie!,"This movie su**s big time!!.The plot is stupid and monotonous.And,every 5 seconds,there's a fighting sequence!.For example,the characters are walking and BOOM!,they begin to fight,two characters are talking and BOOM!,another fight scene!,and it's like this every 5 seconds or so.The special effects are ""average"" compared to other great movies like Star Wars or Terminator.All of the money that was spend making this crappy movie should've been given to a good cause.Why all video game based movies s**k big time!?!.Don't spend any money on this DVD,never!!!"
4,This sequel grows on you .,"I happen to really love this movie even though I know that it is not the best of sequels, but the acting is decent(especially by veteran actor James Remar). The special effects are mostly quite awesome apart from some dodgy flying-through-the-air stuff! Brian Thompson's portrayal of Shao Kahn is deliciously over the top, and Robin Shou is very convincing. I think that the sequel actually has a more in depth plot structure than the original. I did not like the fact that Johnny Cage met such a swift and cruel end, though, and I feel that too many characters were crammed into it just for the hell of it. The twists made it seem too much like a daytime soap for my liking-(I'm my brother's father's mother's grandson, etc). All in all, I found it to be an enjoyable action adventure movie, and Leonard Maltin should just turn off his brain and enjoy the movie for what it is...ENTERTAINMENT!"
1,Mortal Kombat: Abomination,"MK FANS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE IF YOU'VE ALREADY MANAGED TO FOR THE PAST 14 YEARS.MK: A is horribly written and directed. By no means was anyone going into this expecting a Golden Globe or Oscar award winning film but this was just illogical and incoherent garbage in comparison to the work Paul W.S. Anderson (director of the ""Resident Evil"" movie franchise) did with the first film. If you're simply looking to get your ""Klassic"" (UMK3) costume voucher for Jade in Mortal Kombat for the PS3, spend your money wisely and go with the first Mortal Kombat on Blu-ray."
1,WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY!!!,"Gosh, this movie was SUCH a disappointment! The plot was choppy, Johnny Cage is killed in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, so many characters are added, but they have no history...... it's just ridiculous!And it's really sad because the first movies was off da chain! MK was really good, but MK Annihilation was a definite joke. I'm sorry I even saw it."
1,Good God this is horrible,"Being a big fan of the Mortal Kombat video game series and the first movie, I had mixed feelings when I heard Christopher Lambert would not be playing Rayden (he was great). First off, I will say this, the acting is absolutely horrid!!! The acting in the first movie was so-so, but the acting here is simply terrible, especially the actors portraying Motaro, Sheeva, Nightwolf, and Sonya. And what happened to Jax? He went from a cool kind of guy to a token black guy who makes stupid wisecracks. Speaking of stupid wisecracks, James Remar as Rayden was a bad move, the only thing worse than his wisecracks are when he tries to be serious and philosophal about destiny. Shao Khan went from a fearsome enemy from the games to an overacting villian who ain't so fearsome, and why did Johnny Cage have to be killed in the first 8 minutes? Why oh why was this movie even made? Oh well, I just hope they don't make another Mortal kombat movie as bad as this steaming piece of garbage."
2,This s*cks,"This movie kompletely s*cked. It had no plot, unlike the game and the first movie. The only good thing about this movie, was the soundtrack."
2,A BAD SEQUEL,"THIS IS A BAD SEQUEL. THE FIRST MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE HAD GOOD GRAPHICS, AND GREAT ACTION. THIS A LOUSY MOVIE. LOUSY ACTION, NO STORY, BAD SENSE OF HUMOR. THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS ONE IS KITANA. IT ENDS UP WITH A 2 OUT OF 5."
4,"Oh, come on ppl","MKA's pretty good. I mean no sequel is ever better than the first, so remember that when you watch it. MKA picks up where MK finished. You can also get a pretty good laugh out of it. END"
5,Mortal Kombat,Was in excellent condition when i received it only thing was came 1-2 days later then told but it was well worth the wait!
2,Not great but better than really old reruns,This movie was not great cinema but it passed the time on a Saturday and was fairly inexpensive. It was entertaining.
1,From first to worst.,"Mortal Kombat is a great movie. The best video game movie ever and fun even if you never played the game. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the worst video game movie ever made. First off, anytime you can't get the same actors to reprise there roles you know you have a bad movie. A different Sonya and a different Rayden (No way Christohper Lambert would have done this stinker... not even after Highlander 2). The plot isn't just weak, it's stupid. One of the worst sequels ever made."
3,Not as good as the first one.,"This would be a good movie, if it wasn't the second movie of a game.Pros:*This story and the first one flow together very well.*Brings in some new characters, like Jade, and old ones, like Jax.*Good story lineCons:*They didn't use all of the same actors.*They tried to mention every character too much.*Scorpion and Sub-Zero are back, but as the dead ones brothers, I don't think there were two Scorpions and Sub-Zeros.*They focus too much on animalities*SPOILER - Why did they need to kill Johnny?It's a good movie, but not the best game/movie.ReviewAfter winning Mortal Kombat, Johnny, Sonya, Lui, Kitanna, and Raiden return to the temple of light. Then Shao Khan and his generals and asassins(Rain, Sheeva, Ermac, Motaro, Sindel, Mileena, Smoke, Cyrax, and Scorpion #2)come to take over Earthrealm from Outworld. Johnny gets killed :^(. Rayden goes to the eldergods for help while the others find people to help save the world."
1,Worst Sequel!,"What's up with this movie?! I'll tell you what I didn't like. Cast,Plot,The short 4 minutes of seeing one character and then a whole different one,I got to tell you I have the tape for this movie at home and I think I have seen it less than maybe 5 times,thank God! The only thing I liked about the movie was their cool powers! Sighning off,A Jurassic Park fan and lover, Ciao babies!"
2,How is this soo much worse than the first??,"It boggles my mind how this movie sucked so bad compared to the first. I thought the first movie was a hit. After all, it was a low budget movie, yet the special effects were great, the plot was on point, the acting was decent, and it was successful in the box office. This one on the other hand was a complete flop. The special effects made me laugh...it looked so fake! You would think that a couple of years later the technology would be better. They put all these characters from the game but no one really cared because there was know character development at all. They only appeared for about 2 minutes each. It just doesn't make sense how this movie could be soo much worse. You would think they would get a bigger budget for this movie from the success of the first one instead of putting this crap on screen. I wish The same director who did the first one did this one."
1,A big NO!,"If there was an award for the worst movie of all time this movie would be a ruuner-up. It's so bad, words can't describe it. Even those who liked the first one hated this one with a passion."
2,BAD ACTING 101,"The special effects in this movie were pretty good, but the dialogue is cheesy. I am a big fan of the games, yet I think that this film could have been a lot better. Robin Shou is a very talented actor, he just hasn't had his big break yet. Some of the fights were good, but some of them totally sucked. Rent it if you want a predictable martial arts movie, but buy all means, DO NOT BUY THIS!! Take it from a MK fan, see the first and play the games."
1,Dont wast youre time with this movie.,After watching the first one I guesed that annihilation would be better I was wrong the movie was one the most dumbest movies that I have ever seen.The special effects were cheesy the fighting was like something out of power rangers. Stay away from this movie.
2,Too much stuff in it.......,"I liked the first movie a lot so when the second one came out I went to see it,I jus have to say one word about it: CRAP.I have to admit the effects and the fighting scenes were not bad, but I think there was too much characters (many of them appeared for seconds) and the story went too fast, it seems like the producers saw that MK was going down in popularity so they decided to put three movies in one."
1,Viewing this movie may kill brain cells,"I saw the first movie 4 times in the theatre, and this one once on video. Once you get past the recasting of actors, the addition of too many new characters for the length of this film, poor dialogue, bad acting, and the lack of plot, you have a couple of really good fight scenes (and a few attractive women in leotards). But that doesn't rescue this movie from a fiery, downward spiral. The sad part was, I didn't think any movie based on a martial arts video game could be worse than Street Fighter, but this one was (but not by a whole lot). Please do not waste your time with this movie - Utterly Horrible!!!"
1,MORTAL KOMBAT,I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS MOVIE AND I WAS CHARGE FOR ITI WOULD LOOK TO RECEIVE THE DVDTHANK YOUCAN SOMEONE EMAIL ME WITH THIS INFOrossannemccullough@hotmail.comor call me at 312-404-0267 my name is ROSSANNE MCCULLOUGH
2,I Understand Where The Book Was Going But....,"it didn't quite make it. The author's attempt to shine a light on one of the oldest but still important topic of teen sex reads like an old Afterschool Special. Between the three teenage girls in this novel, they deal with abortion, infertility, rape, and HIV. Yes these consequences are real but the stiff, outdated dialogue makes it hard to take the extreme consequences in this book seriously.Hats off for the topic and the effort put out by this author. Competition in young adult fiction is tough. There's nothing wrong with hitting heavy topics but you don't want it to bounce off of deaf ears by not making the language and storyline fit the times. Most people don't like to be preached to, that goes double for teenagers. I suggest that you choose your approach through storylines carefully. It could make the difference of your book moving off the shelves to a cash register or just being moved over in order to grab another book by someone else."
5,A really great read,I read the book and I loved it. It is a great book for teenage girls to read and could even teach them a lot. Every line of the book makes you want to keep reading and keeps you enthralled till the very end. I recommend this book to everyone who loves a good book that keeps you entranced to the end.
4,Cute,Very nice little stuffed animal. Purchased for my girlfriend at the time and she loved it. Great for all ages.
5,H is for Hippo!,"I bought this for my grand-daughter. She absolutely loves it, takes it everywhere she goes. I've had to make special trips to go back and get it. Very well made and sturdy. This hippo gets lots of attention and hasn't suffered even one loose thread."
4,Great Riddle Book,"Although this book is rated for 9-12 year olds, my 7 year old daughter found lots of riddles she likes. The riddles include puns and other plays on words. Every other page has a cute illustration accompanying the riddle. Good riddle books for young readers are hard to find. This one is worth a look!"
5,Has helped my mother greatly!,"My mother suffers from terrible tremors. This, along with Native Remedies TremorSoothe, has GREATLY helped my mother. The change was apparent in just a couple of days."
3,Thought it was made by stihl.,"I thought that this product was actually made by Stihl. But it turns out it was made by Oregon, not what I expected."
3,ok movie,pretty alright for a low budget movie. it can pass as a soft core porn. this is every geeks fantasy. lol.
3,"Useful book, but plodding, dreary style.","I found the information solid and useful. I was primarily interested in British infantry techniques in this era and he does a good job explaining them, although I found Rory Muir's writings more helpful on the subject. Despite what others have said, I find Nosworthy's writing style hard to digest. Its convoluted, plodding, and quite dry. He has clearly done is research, but this has all of the bad hallmarks of a scholarly treatise that only the most dedicated will want to plough through. This has the feel of a phd dissertation that once read, will be quickly sent to basement storage in some university library. I love the period, but it took a lot of effort for me to finish the book. If you are a dedicated scholar, buy it. If you are a novice, buy ""Swords Around the Throne"" by John Elting , for the French side, and ""All for the King's Shilling,"" by Edward Coss, if you want to get the British perspective."
4,How Can You Go Wrong With Tony?,"I rented this mostly cause I saw that Barbara Eden is in this, truth be told she is for about 3 seconds. Tony Randall is amazing in this (but then again he always is). I really wish someone would do a remake to this."
4,"Great mix of funk, old school hip-hop and soul","I recently got the first document from a friend and soon after it was the only cd in my player. When I found out document 2 was coming out I had to get it. Just like the original document album, this mixes well known (black sheep -the choice is yours) and totally unheard of tracks (serge bainsbourgh?? with french vocals) seamlessly. The tempo stays pretty consistent throughout so if you can handle the changes in music from song to song, for example Jack Jones (a vocalist from the 60's kinda like Tom Jones) singing about how he'll never fall in love again with a great beat behind it to Eric B & Rakim and the beat stays pretty much the same. I'm not a big fan of current day hip hop (Jay Z, 50 cent, etc.) but can get into the old stuff if presented correctly....this is the way for me. He used more hip hop in this album than in the original but it's all good. If you want to try something different and cool, try it!"
2,Not what I had anticipated.,"I will give Cassie Edwards the benefit as Spirit Warrior is the first Indian romance novel I read by Edwards. I thoroughly enjoy reading Indian romances, though I am disappointed with this book. There wasn't enough substance, the suspense is in short supply, although the love making describe by Edwards between the main characters (Spirit Warrior and Denise) is captivating, then again the plot is very predicable leading up to their union and what followed. By time I read 3/4 of this novel, I was hoping I would gain more insight into the characters as there was room for Edwards to develop the main and supporting roles better. In terms of the time frame, months appeared to turn into days in the story line. I was rushed through this book. It seemed that Edwards was hurried to publish this piece."
2,meh...,"I usually get excited seeing a new Cassie Edwards book on the shelf, but this one has to dissapoint me. I'm not sure what was wrong with it, but it didn't...shine in my face. Her other works are very well-crafted and beautiful but something about this one just didn't work for me. Maybe the fact that Spirit Warrior was a shamon. It kept him so holy. What intrigued me in her other work was how ""wild"" the male of the story was. But, in a way, Spirit Warrior was too ""feminine"" for me. And although Edwards uses ""love-at-first-sight"" in most of her books, I think she overdid it this time. (or just noticed it)I wouldn't scorn you if you read this book. There are many interesting fact that makes you still wanna believe you're the heroine of the book, but don't get your hopes up. I got mine up and came out the door dissapointed."
2,"Good book, unnecessarily graphic","I am a conservative reader and I don't like to read books that have more than a PG-13 content. This was a good book but it described in detail an incestual relationship. While I don't believe that we should gloss over the world's problems, I do believe that we can cover them without graphic details. I love the way Allende writes, but I wish that she would write more with a PG or PG-13 type content instead of R. With that said, I appreciate the subject matter and her great descriptions and characters."
2,Uneasy mix between melodrama and the supernatural,"Being a fan of Auster and Keitel I was looking forward to ""Lulu"". On the plus side; the acting is great and the plot is pretty offbeat. But the stuff about the weird stone and the ""cult"" (?!) doesn't really work to say the least. People who hated the plot of ""Jacob's Ladder"" should also avoid this. And Mira and Harvey as a couple didn't really convince me (even though when I'm at Keitel's age I would surely love to find a young groovy chick like Mira!). Credits must go to the somewhat original script and the inspired performances but still, well, I guess I just ain't that romantic uncynically kind of guy. But check it out because it's not a total waste of your time if you're lookin' for something different (even though my girl fell asleep)."
3,mixed feelings,"The first time I saw this movie, I must have been on post-surgical painkillers or something because I thought it was really great. Then I watched it again several years later and the person I watched it with still has not forgiven me for the loss of those two hours of her life. She might be right."
2,A mess.,"It is getting to be a cliche that you can bookend a messy, incoherent story comprising levitating rocks and a menacing anthropologist with the shooting, then the death, of the protagonist and get away with calling it a discussion of the metaphysical. Yawn. See ""Jacob's Ladder"" for a more stylish and significantly more engaging trot through the same subject matter. In its defense, the acting is excellent. And just how much older is Harvey Keitel than Mira Sorvino, anyway?"
2,Please...,"Although this movie has going for it Harvey Keitel as well as an interesting mystery stone, overall it is pure arthouse garbage. Yes, I like enigmatic, intricate movies. Yes I can suspend my disbelief. Yes I like it when movies enter a realm where reality as we know it loses ground. But this story is a mish mash. See Donnie Darko or even, as suggested by other reviewers, Jacob's Ladder for better made, well-constructed films that touch on the same subjects.Only about 10 minutes of this flick retained my attention. The rest was at best a yawn and for the most part, a frustrating eye-roller. Mostly wooden performances (Keitel is his usual bad self, DaFoe is more than adequate) but the story is just cheesy and it has one of the worst endings I have ever seen. I almost threw up."
4,Lulu is a bridge,"I've seen this movie twice on cable, Stars or Encore. Maybe HBO. It's a sweet little thing about love unconditional. I like that Lou Reed has a role, Not Lou Reed. Would buy this DVD just to see him on screen (Lou Reed rocks!). The film was good, but best was it introduced me to Pandora's Box, a play and then silent film starring Louise Brooks as Lulu. The play and movie are classics; Brooksie, was a classic beauty. She embodies everything that was the Jazz Age flapper."
3,Not as much fun as the original Movies,"Well, I'm 33 years old and I still prefer the original Disney versions. This video has 4 short pieces that aren't really about learning. They seem to be a just collection from the Saturday morning series packaged in a new way. I thought that this video misses most of the Magic of Pooh and I was disappointed, however my kids watch it and don't seem to mind."
5,This is the real Tahiti!,"I have been going to Tahiti for more than 40 years. In the old days Marie Mariteragi and her family would play this old, authentic Paumotu music at the Hotel Stuart next to the Post Office in Papeete. You can not find a better example of this enchanting music any where. I sent many copies to old friends in Tahiti and they all agree that this is the best."
2,Disappointed,"The sweater was ultra light-weight and basically useless for warmth value. It is well-made, but not of much value to me."
3,The Healing Light,"The book has a timely message! I first read this book in 1968 and it changed my life. I have used many of the prayer methods and have seen wondrous miracles of healing and transformation. I recently started a book club and the book seemed new all over again. It definitely shows that Jesus is still in the healing business! This author coined the phrase ""inner child"" and tells of the importance of healing the child within so we become healthier adults."
5,Love this Book!,"I can't put this book down. I am learning to heal and learning to be a healer. This books is must read. Even though it was written originally in 1947, her words still apply and she has a way of getting the message across that is very effective. You cannot go wrong reading this book if these are topics you are interested in."
5,A Timeless Treasure,"I got my first copy of this book almost twenty years ago from a friend who was 90 years old and was such a great example in my life. Next to the Bible, it has been the book that has been a healing light in my own life.Way ahead of her time and other books like The Secret, Agnes Sanford understood how the Kindgom of God works. Her simple words and examples through stories she gives in The Healing Light, are an inspiration no matter what you may be going through.I buy copies of this book all the time and give it as a gift to encourage others. It is a timeless treasure."
4,Interesting book!,"This book gives much ""food for thought."" It arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
3,Shipping Nightmare,This was part of a birthday gift and I used next day shipping...received email the next day stating that it was sent to another location and would be a day late.
5,Gorgeous Book,"I picked up this book years ago when it came out. Outstanding photographs throughout. Since then I married and moved a lot of my books into an office. I recently rearranged my office and found the Leibovitz book and looked through it again. I still am impressed with the images even after about 5 years of not viewing them. Really a time capsule of collected photos.This is an excellent book and I would encourage you to get a copy if you have any interest in photography, pop culture or simply beautiful images."
2,Disappointed,"Tons of facts about a slew of rock n roll singers and bands but next to no interesting trivia, stories, or tidbits. I thought it would be fun to have this around, skim through it, look up bands I like, but I find I get a lot more out of looking them up on Wikipedia."
2,Rustoleum Epoxy Sheild,"I like in the Northeast, snow, salt, hot, cold.I spent weeks on cleaning and prep having read that you cannot spend too much time to have a totally clean surface (yes you can). Pressure washer, stiff brush, TSP, blah, blah,The floor looked great for the first year and then it quickly went down hill. It did not peel but the surface did wear badly. I followed the instructions to the letter, mixing, cure time so installation was not the problem.I used more than enough material and did not spread it on too thin.The fact is that the for difficult weather conditions, the material is just not up to the job.If you down south or in the west, wear snow, ice and salt is not an issue this product may do fine, but for others, try something else.I am now looking at a industrial floor mat, a lot of money but I suspect much more durable."
3,Just OK,"I coated my garage with Rustoieum grey and fleck, turned out great, was a flat finish though? Two days later did the clear. The base coat came in two one gallons cans. The clear came in two one gallon cans, but one had 2/3 of a gallon and the other 1/3 of a gallon in them, mixed to one gallon. Coverage of 250/500 sq. feet????, weight 52 pounds?? Did not make it and now I need to cover the whole thing again. Does look good though."
4,A Memory Movie... Almost Regal.,"Once upon a time, many years ago, there was more to movies than chases, bloodbaths, rapping, and sadistic violence. The movies I refer to had exitement, not only created by plot, but by the existance of Actors who could act without shouting, overplaying ""attitude, wearing rags and generally looking like hell.This movie could have had Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren or a host of other Actors in the lead role. Ms. Deneuve did a fine job, as did the rest of the cast.It was a delightful trip back into the finer moments of the entertainments that can only be provided by wellmade films and unadulterated acting, performed by professional Actors.A beautiful film to watch and well worth it's reputation."
3,ok melodrama,"Maybe it's just me misled by the movie descrption of some kind of mistery. This movie has nothing to do with mistery even though stolen diamonds play important role in its plot. It's rather a melodrama about love that can survive anything, including betrayal. Catherine Deneuve is very very good but it was just too slow for me. I believe that this movie was intended to have some suspense to it, which is totally absent. It's not so bad though that a real fan of french movies cannot still enjoy it."
1,Be not deceived by this.,"Mozart Unexpurgated!This is a watered-down, sanitized English version of the original German and Italian. Had Mozart meant these to be songs for prudish children, he would have worded them differently. Also, I find it fraudulent not to state in the description that this is not in the original languages, while names in the list of contents are in German and Italian."
4,A classic for lovers of shipwrecked movies,"I fell in love with this movie as a small boy, and I'm still quite fond of it well into my later 20's. If you enjoyed watching the original ""Treasure Island"", as a child, or have found yourself sitting down with your kids watching Brian Henson's version of ""Treasure Island""(The Muppets), than this is another great shipwreacked story for you. A well animated movie for it's time, it features 15 school children lost at sea learning how to survive on their own. It teaches your children the meaning of true frienship to it's fullest. This is the childrens version of that show, ""Survivor"", you adults love to watch, but with a strong meaning behind it. So now you know. A little something for you. A little something for the kids. How could you not want to watch this with your children. They'll be glad you did, and so will you."
3,Too difficult for me,"Maybe I've read way too much fiction, but this was really tough for me. We tried it for our small group, and only one of the guys would really get something out of it. I did get little bits out of each chapter, but it was really difficult for me to stay interested. Don't get me wrong. It's a great book with lots of facts and details. I think maybe it's just meant for someone that really remembered all the details in history class. That was not my strong suit."
5,order for my mother,shes a wiersbe addict :)not a bad thing to have an addiction tolots of fine books he has written
3,more nostalgia,"This song was on Deee-Lite's second album ""Infinity Within."" That album flopped badly, but I still think it's awesome. Maybe most were bothered by all the PC lyrics, not a problem for me as a progressive. The photo on the CD shows Lady Miss Kier upside down using a telephone. So femme and fabulous! She was probably in Manhattan, but it could have been Paris. It's hard to describe it in words, but one mix of ""Thank You"" had an awesome string or keyboard hook that I found very catchy. To be honest, a DJ friend let me hear a slammin' mix of ""Thank You"" that was unfortunately not on this CD-single. Deee-Lite didn't put their best foot forward by offering many mixes and especially good ones. However, if you love Lady Miss Kier's voice and you appreciate the underappreciated ""Infinity,"" then you might as well add this to your collection. This is especially true if you loved dance music from the early 1990s."
1,Dated Material,"I was in such a rush to obtain course construction material for vocational education I didn't look at the publishing date. Although some of the material may be used today, most of the text, pictures and examples are very dated (1977). Vocational Education is, and has, been adjusting to the times. I would suggest looking for an updated version for course construction."
4,The Mystery,I ordered this in error but I was glad I got it. It was gory when it came to the seals but the rest of the book was very good. I enjoyed the part when they were on the island and what happened after. It kept me wanting to read more.
3,Target,This is an Interesting read for a 7th grader. Not much meat and little plot for it to be a true mystery.
2,Not worthwhile. Dated.,"Of SEW's works, this one has not stood the test of time and is a big disapointment. It is in the same flavor as ERB's Tarzan at the Earth's Core in that it tries to justify an imanginative but fantastic tale based on contemparary scientific explanations that today seem naive and foolish. It does, however, show a prediliction for the supernatural that SEW will turn to later in life."
4,"Quick arrival, highly satisfied!","I have never tried out the bareMinerals product line before, but everyone spoke so highly of it, so I thought it'd be worth a try. I used the color match images provided by the seller to find my right color. The product looks great for the most part, however, I picked a color a little too light for me, so next time, I would go with the shade a little darker so it also will work when I'm tan. The package came quickly and it perfect condition. Would definitely work with this seller again!"
1,Sorry but I like Sheer Cover so much better!,I've always been a Sheer Cover user since it came out on TV. Then I kept seeing the Bare Minerals commercials too. I thought one day I'd goto Spehora & buy the Bare Minerals and see if it works the same or better. Well I have to say Sheer Cover is so much better. Sheer Cover feels better and looks better. So I am giving this one star.
3,"Just OK, but I found something better","I have been using Bare Minerals in Fairly Light for three years, and while it is better overall than any liquid foundation on the market for sensitive skin, it's not great. This powder highlights the dry areas of my skin and does not hold up well against midday shine on my T-zone. Also, I think I may be slightly allergic/sensitive to mica, because my face feels a little itchy right after applying. I've only continued using it because I have been unable to find something better.Until now, that is. Meow Cosmetics is a small internet-based brand, they have 3 coverage formulations and over 80 shade choices, and you get three times the amount of product for the same price as Bare Minerals. I find that their formulation is gentler on my skin and offers better coverage, and I will be switching brands as soon as I finish off my last jar of Bare Minerals."
2,not so great for sensitive skin,"I wouldn't recommend this product for truly sensitive skin. The quality of my skin degraded when I used this product--within a few days of use, the most sensitive areas of my face got a little blotchy (reddish), and the skin around my nose as well as between my nose and upper lip became persistently itchy. I think that most people will love this product--the first day that I used it, it went on so silky. It felt so light and my face looked finished. If you think that you might have sensitive skin, you'll probably be fine--but if you know that you have really sensitive skin, beware."
1,Ladies Beware!!!,"I like most of you tried Bare Minerals after seeing glowing infomercials. I'm only in my late twenties and don't have many lines, but I feel like the foundation aged me twenty years. My skin was dry and taut and it actually made my pores look larger. I felt like it sapped all the moisture out of my skin. This product might be good for women with oily skin who live in humid climates, but if you live in a dry climate like me, do not buy this product! I've found better products at the drugstore, Neutrogena Healthy Skin Tint is excellent for the price and it will leave your skin looking a whole lot better."
2,... Maybe my skin is just too sensitive,"I used this foundation a long while ago. At first I really liked it and the coverage it gave, but I've tried better. But after using for about a month of continuous use it gave me really bad acne. I'm still trying to fix the mess it made on my skin. I now use Everyday Minerals which has been a godsend to my face for makeup."
1,Cystic acne and scars from this makeup!,"I didn't have flawless skin before trying this product, but I also never had cystic acne before. The makeup looked good and I liked it, but after a few weeks, I started getting horrible, sore, red cysts ALL over my face, but especially on my cheeks. It took me a while to figure out it was the makeup, but once I stopped using it, my skin improved immediately. It's been about two years since I last used this stuff, and I still have some acne scars that are faded but not quite gone. The red scars were really upsetting for a very, very long time. Do not buy this item!"
1,AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT DID NOT LIKE IT?,"I find the product very messy to use. The powder manages to get over everything, i.e, vanity, clothes. I am middle aged with very good skin and I am not very wrinkled. This product accentuated my pores and the tiny wrinkles I do have. If I used very little like it says, it did not provide any coverage. If you use too much it covers but makes your face shiny and not natural. The colors were also hard to match. The darker too dark and the lighter, too light (almost ghost like). I don't know what all the fuss is about at all. I gave it to my 15 year old daughter to try who has acne. Maybe it would work for her. What a mistake, not only did it also accentuate her pores, it did not cover the acne, not even using the bisque and she broke out more. This product also takes a long time to apply. I did not like it at all nor would I recommend it but apparently I am certainly in the minority on this one."
1,thoroughly disappointing... and a little upsetting.,"I have a basic and non-time consuming make-up regimen, I also have very fair skin. I had hoped that Bare Escentuals would deliver as a shortcut to UV protection and providing light coverage with a natural finish. No such luck! I swear this product INVENTS fine lines and wrinkles. It is bizarrely ""glowy"" and makes me look shiny everywhere. It magnifies pores and lines by settling into them. It also takes much more time to apply than any other face powder I have ever used. The color wasn't bad, but the application, required brush, price, and performance were truly disappointing. Spare yourself and do not buy this product."
1,Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this product,"After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days. I previously tried Cover Girl Mineral makeup and had the same reaction, but did not realize the connection until now. Following research online-I discovered that many women suffer this same rash from the Bismuth Oxychloride contained in this product and some other brands like Cover Girl.For those with Sensitive Skin, I would suggest finding a brand without that ingredient. There are several brands."
2,Too many fine lines,Its covers the blemishes well unfortunately it highlights all of the fine lines. Not exactly what I wanted it to do. Bare Minerals Multi Tasking seems to work much better
5,Second part of a gift,"We bought this as a second part of a gift for my mother-in-law. She was over the moon because she loves this product so much. It is a perfect gift for a woman who has everything and better yet, it is something she will use."
4,Best for touch up imho,"I love BE as a concealer/ even outer for most of my face However, it looks cakey under my eyes (I prefer a liquid concealer there), and seems to make lines around my nose and mouth more noticeable. I agree with a previous reviewer that this would probably make great skin better, but not as true for semi-problem skin. I personally love to use BE in the day just on my more smooth areas of my face (lightly) and as a spot concealer. When I want more coverage, I use liquid."
2,matte product -off color,This product is the MATTE version of BareMinerals Foundation and is a totally different color than the original Fairly Light...a bit confusing ..this one has way more yellow and did not match my skin tone.
3,bareMinerals ORIGINAL SPF 15 Foundation Fairly Medium,"I like how this foundation goes smooth on face and adds a little bit of a glow, but it gives too little coverage for me, and coverage is not very buildable. I prefer Pur minerals foundation for better coverage and buildability."
5,Love this product!,"I've been using this mineral foundation for over five years because it is the best I've tried. I experimented with cheaper mineral products from a drug store, but I didn't get the same flawless coverage. The coverage is very natural looking. You can control the amount of coverage you are looking for by simply applying more or less of the product. Again, this stuff is the best, and it continues to receives high ratings in magazines for a reason!"
4,Love this foundation,This foundation is very lightweight and non-greasy. It feels as tough you don't have any on which I love and also love the fact it has SPF in it.
1,Be aware,I order bare minerals about 2 month ago. I bought the starter kit and it cost me a little over $60. Two months later a new charge for bare minerals showed up in my bank account. I called bare mineral customer service and they told me that when I purchase the product on the 2nd page on the agreement it clearly states that you have to be a member to order the product and that a monthly fee is associated with it. This is ridiculous they put this on the second page almost toward the end so if you don't finish reading the whole statement they can take your money. Please make sure that you read the whole statement.If there product is good why they have to scam people like this.
2,Good but...,"I really like some of the products from this company. Their brushes are great, warmth is awesome, but I noticed that right after I bought my new foundation, my skin started breaking out. Like bad. I've had a few pimples in my day but my forehead looks as if I just rubbed oil on it for a month straight. I can't say that it will make your face break out, but beware that it might. I'm definitely going to stop using it and return to my older clinique foundation."
1,Don't buy unless you want horrible breakout!,"I recently purchase the starter kit of Bare Essentials at a Large Beauty Store. I used it, then about on the 3rd. day my chin and cheeks broke out into pimple like welts and were very itchy. My skin rarely breaks out so this is something I was not used to at all. I have beautiful skin to start with and thought this would be a nice natural way to do my make-up. I can't stand this product. The worst I have ever used. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Made me Breakout,"1 STAR *I've just realized my acne got worse since I started using this foundation. I have grains now all over my face especially in the T-zone which was not like that before. Pores look bigger like giant holes and the coverage isn't superb either. Also, it made my skin feel itchy. BAD BAD BAD! :("
2,Bare Mineral Mishap,Although I love Bare Minerals. I received an older container; not the click-lock-go container as advertized. I must say this must be an older product and it goes on that way. Be careful and if you do not receive the click-lock-go then send it back.
1,wrong color,"thought I ordered Medium beige, but was sent Medium. I still love bareMinerals makeup, this color just a little too light"
1,Beware!!!,"I LOVE Bare Minerals Original Foundation and give it 5 stars.. I am rating this with 1 star because I believe it is a knock off or a fake. I'd actually give it 0 stars if that was an option. I have been using Bare Minerals Original Foundation Medium Beige for nearly seven years now... What I received is NOT the original foundation. What I received is more like a tinted mineral veil. It has a shimmer to it which the original foundation is not supposed to have. The coverage was not that of the original foundation but more of the mineral veil. Be careful who you buy from. Before I bought this from this seller, I always got it from Sephora. Lesson learned! I will never order from anywhere else again."
5,Great Product,"Wouldn't leave the house without my Bare Escentuals Foundation. Love, Love, Love it!! Gives a very soft and natural feel to the skin."
5,"Quick Shipping, Exactly as Expected!","I've been using bareMinerals foundation for several years, and recently began buying off Amazon since I know what I need and the price is fairer. This merchant shipped quickly and delivered my item exactly as expected! Thank you!!"
4,A good product with a few flaws,"I always hated how long it took to put foundation on, being able to feel it on my face, and the effort of washing it off every night. This product has solved all those problems. Applying the foundation takes maybe 30 seconds, I don't feel like I have anything on my face and this stuff won't hurt your skin if you leave in on at night.But this isn't the miracle product the commercials claim. It does have a tendency to look cakey if you use too much, and using the right amount of product can take a few tries. My only real complaint about this product is the caps. They have a tendency to come loose. Much of the product ended up in my makeup bag, and this product costs too much to lose much of it.The starter kit is the way to go; I was going to try just the foundation but was glad I got the starter kit. It's a really good deal compared to buying them separately."
4,Great for Natural Look,"After years of not wearing make-up I tried to use bare minerals. Although I liked the way it looked, for some reason, my face felt itchy. So, I stopped using and started wearing MAC. But, MAC often made me feel like I was wearing make-up. So, one day, on may way to the MAC counter, I stumbled across bare minerals again.This time, I learned the proper way to apply it and what a difference that made! And, I love it! It really looks and feels natural. It makes me look better but not made up. I can wear it every day. And, people compliment me on looking great. So, my suggestion is that you take the time to go to a make-up counter and learn the proper techniques before you buy.My only concern is that bare minerals does not cover dark circles very well. So, I use Bobbi Brown for that. But, the other bare mineral products can help to give you a natural glow of beauty. And, the brushes are reasonably priced compared to other high end cosmetic brands."
1,Changed product!,This product is not the same as it used to be. Doesn't cover well at all and I don't have much to cover up. Just is not worth the money anymore.
1,Not the real thing?,"I have used Bare Minerals for 7 years and had no issues. I started using this from Amazon on Sunday and was not happy with it. The foundation does not cover as it has previously and the color is off. I supposedly received the correct color. I bought another foundation from Sephora yesterday and will compare the two. I will not buy from Amazon again due to this past experience.UPDATE - I received my foundation from Sephore and IT WAS EXACTLY AS EXPECTED. The foundation covered exactly how it and how I expected. I will NEVER buy Bare Minerals from Amazon due to this experience. It is a shame that the quality of the foundation cannot be guaranteed. Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, I thought there would be no quality issues."
1,Be advised...,"I received this item today and am very disappointed that it's advertised as containing ""9"" grams but, in fact, is only ""8."" bareMinerals is a great product and I've used it for many years...thought this was a good price but not so much."
4,"Light, natural coverage","This is a great foundation if you're looking for a lighter coverage. I wear this in the Fair shade, and it blends very well with my skin tone and looks incredibly natural. I do like the matte Bare Escentuals foundation better than the original, because my skin is a bit oily and using the matte foundation helps prevent a bit against shine that can build up during the day. I would never wear this foundation without a primer, though...otherwise it wears off super quick. Still, it's easy to apply, it looks great, and I would recommend it."
5,love it,"BareMinerals is a great product! Who knew something as simple as a powder could replace liquid foundation! I don't know it does it, but it does. Mixed with Golden Medium, this is the perfect shade for me."
2,Not so amazing,"I was so excited to find a makeup that would cover completely without breaking me out. I don't have oily skin, but most makeups give me the occassional breakout anyway. This makeup didn't cover half as well as I had hoped. In fact, I've bought wet 'n wild makeup that has done better. To top it off, the breakouts came anyway."
5,Amazing Makeup,"This foundation makes your skin look airbrushed. I have flaky skin around my chin, so it is often difficult to find a foundation that will hide this type of flaw. As it did not hide it completely, it does however make it a lot easier to take off the flakes with tweezers. Not only that, it feels better on my face all day. I have gone back to other foundations before and have only returned to bare minerals. There truly is nothing like it."
1,Why the fuss?,"I have tried mineral makeup on several occasions. When it first came out years ago, and just recently. I should have learned from the first time. I tossed it. I can see where woman who don't wear makeup would like it - it looks like you have nothing on. It doesn't feel that way, however. My pores felt smothered. If you want the no-makeup look - why bother spending the money. Go au-natural!Another thing I did not like was the mess of the fine particals. Is anyone concernced about nanoparticles in the lungs!? I don't want to breath this stuff in every morning."
2,Overhyped powder foundation,This powder foundation is quite messy to apply and makes your face have a shiny and luminescent look.Not good because it emphasizes pores and wrinkles. I do give it 2 stars for being lightweight with SPF coverage.I will not purchase this powder again.
5,The best product ever,This is the best make up for skin. I haven't had a break out or oily skin since I started to use this brand. I would never smear all those chemicals from the liquid make ups on my face again.
4,Great product,I've been using colorscience for years now and love the powder built into the application brush...this powder works just as well for a fraction of the price but the only downside is the mess it leaves after you put it on...if they had a better applicator it would be IDEAL!Overall for the price it's a GREAT product!
1,irritants,"This powder was just a disaster for me. It made my face very itchy, and gave me the absolute worst breakouts of my life. I still have the scars from them, two years later. I wouldn't recommend this product, especially to anyone with sensitive skin."
4,"Great seller, great product.","For the most part bare minerals SPF 15 Foundation is great.My Pros:I love that it buffs on easily and provides excellent coverage. It's easy to use, light weight and you can apply it start to finish in minutes.My cons:I hate that it doesn't last as long as you would like. It's definitely not a 16 hr make-up. It rubs off and becomes uneven through out the day. I find I have to apply another round if I want it to look finished for an evening out after a day of work.My review of seller :Excellent! Super timely and free shipping was a huge PLUS! Package got to me before it's expected date even and was packed securely!Overall :I recommend this product. It's easy to use, very clean, and beautiful coverage. Just be prepared that you might have to reapply it to maintain a ""fresh"" look. :)"
5,Good Deal,This was just what I needed. Although I already knew the color I wanted so I would suggest finding the right color first.
1,Not real bareMinerals,"My first order of this was with bareMinerals. When I needed more I thought I would save some money and purchase this one instead of going through the company. It is definitely NOT the same as what I received from bareMinerals! The coverage was terrible, weird shade and it irritated my skin. Spend the extra money and purchase through bareMinerals."
4,Does not cover as well as newer bare minerals.,"It's really a good quantity for the price. The only thing is that it doesn't cover blemishes as well as the newer bare mineral foundation. Therefore, I must use my new ""fairly light"" to cover blemishes then use this to cover all over.Overall, not bad."
1,Poor coverage,Not the same coverage quality as identical product purchased in the past. I would not purchase this in the future.
5,Excellent,This product was just as it is when you purchase it from the Sephora store. It's even better though... because I didn't have to waste time going to Sephora and picking it up! I also think it had a $3 discount from the store price. Very happy.
1,Dissapointed,"NOT REAL! I still had powder left from the real Bare Escentuals (tried to get it cheaper ...) and this is not the same. One, its darker. Two, made me break out. Three, does not go on or blend like the real one. Four, clumpy and sticky - does not come out easily. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,love it!,I won't use anything else. It provides full coverage with a sun kissed glow. And it's so light and doesn't clog pores. I can even sleep with it on. Best product for the best price on the market.
2,"Flat, too many steps","The Bare Escentuals products don't work for me. Yes, the makeup stayed on all day but was cakey and it felt like it was a pore clogger. I didn't like the way it is dispensed, makes a mess when transferred to the cap and whirled around. Also, it is very expensive. MAC products are by far better."
5,It's part of my daily rutine,"I use it for 5 years, love it, my face doesnt look DONE, would not be without it. In summer I add the faux tan to it to match my natural suntan, it's also a good sunblock"
1,Too pink for me.,I was very dissatisfied with this product. It made my pores appear larger than normal and it was too pink. I will never buy make-up online again.
2,Didn't work for me!,"I let a coworker talk me into trying Bare Escentuals. In theory I like it--I don't like applying heavy, oily feeling foundations to my face so the thought of a powder was intriguing. I found it covered well, but no matter what color or tint I used, it made my skin color look off. The sales person said this sometimes happens and suggested I try a similar mineral foundation from another company which worked much better with my skin tones. What I found hard to believe though was that none of their hues that matched my skin tone managed to look natural."
1,Do not like this product,"I really don't understand what all the fuss is about this make-up. Using it with the concealer brush seems to cause the powder to cake up in creases like around your nose and under eyes throughout the day, which is gross. Also, it seemed to make my face oily by the end of the day rather than keep me from getting shiny like it's supposed to. It's also supposed to have staying power (doesn't come off in water??), but I found it does not stay on very well when you're working out rigorously, so I ended up removing before going to the gym. All in all, I'm totally disappointed and am sorry I spent the money on the kit. I'll stick to traditional concealer and pressed powder, which looks much more natural than this product."
5,Great value for High Quality Coverage makeup,"I bought this product at a regular store (Ulta) and fell in love with it. It does not look caked on and it covers most flaws: Dark circles, pimples, red zits, and those hickies from your husband/ boyfriend! :) It evens out your skin tone and gives your face a universal color. When you first put it on it may appear that it looks somewhat cakey, but once you go outside the moisture and air makes it look absolutely natural. I love it because it is a powder but ends up looking so sheer like a cream. However, it DOES NOT give you that ugly foundation line by your ears and jaw line. Buy it...this shade is for a woman who has a naturally light tan, but during the winter gets whiter. It gives you some warmth to your skin without looking like your putting bronzer from a bottle on your face. :)"
2,Jeez,So I was excited to order this and I had chosed the light color lightest one because I'm pale and the I get it and it looks so dark! Didn't work out looked pretty gross
1,Junk,"This make- up is terrible! When you first put it on it looks great. Very natural and light. However, give it 2 hours and you will be very disappointed. It faded completely away and I looked awful. It makes a big mess when you put it on, fades after 2 hours, totally not worth it."
2,Did not work with my skin!,"When I applied this makeup, I loved it! I have very clear skin and after I put it on my skin looked soft and pretty. My job involves a lot of running around and I sweat, but when I had the bare minerals on it was so light weight and breathable. It doesnt completely cover all my blemishes though, I had to use an additional concealer for them. I used it for about a week and I started to notice my skin getting red. Then I broke out HORRIBLY... I had huge cysts like pimples that I have never got before! It was all along my jaw line and my chin. I didn't realize with was the makeup that was making my face breakout until about 3 weeks later I finally stopped using it. It took awhile for my face to get back to normal. Now I use Clinque, it doesnt make my face breakout. A lot of people had great results with this product but I believe it all depends on your skin type! I didnt know my skin was so sensitve because I never had problems with it before!"
2,authentic?,"I've been using this product for a long time. I believe this product is not authentic. I can tell by how it covers my skin, by how much I have to use, and by it's consistency."
4,Very Good,I have bought this product twice now. It does not break me out and gives a moderate coverage. Its one of those foundations that you can't see going all over but it hides most things.
1,Not as expected!,"I have been using this product for many years, but what I received was in no way the same product. It did not cover as well or last as long. Perhaps it was a fake. I will not order it again."
1,Not for Dark Skin,"I was terribly disappointed. I bought this after seeing it on QVC. The ""dark"" and ""deep"" colors look great in the jar, but look white and shiny on the skin.The only thing halfway decent is the mineral veil as a light powder over my regular foundation. It is very sheer and absorbs the shine."
1,"Not what I ordered, and not sealed.","I received my Bare Minerals foundation in the mail expecting it to be the same color I've used for years. This was unfortunately not what I received. As soon as I opened the package I realized the product was not sealed. There was make up everywhere in the box and around the container itself. It was all scratched and banged up as if it had been rolling around in someone's make up drawer. Not to mention, it was not Bare Minerals Light, it had a very obvious sparkle in it which I've never had in my Bare Minerals original foundation before. I sent it back immediately."
1,Made me look older,"I really wanted to like this product.....but I did not. It is expensive, and it settled in my fine lines, making me look older than I do without make up at all. The ""concealer"" didn't conceal anything. It says it's not a powder, and feel more creamy, but it just felt like powder to me, and I felt like I had to put too much on to try and get any coverage at all. Then it just looked like I had too much make up on. I would advise anyone that wants to try it, to go to a Bare Escentuals store, or Sephora, wherever.......and try it before buying it."
1,Not for everyone: Bad for SOME skin types,"I loved this product at first: the coverage was great, especially for my adult-acne skin. But there's the problem. I've always gotten breakouts from powders. A friend convinced me this ""wasn't a powder,"" but if it looks like a powder and spills like a powder, it's a powder. Sadly, this product gave me the really bad kind of acne I haven't had since I was a teenager (I'm in my thirities now). It's accurate to say that it polluted my skin. Eventually I realized I was using this makeup mainly to cover up the very blemishes it was giving me. It's sad, because the makeup did make my skin look flawless--for about three weeks."
5,great skin just a couple of steps away,"I tried quite a few foundation products before I came across Bare Minerals. I had given up on make-up foundations because no matter what product I used on my face, it would break-out after a day or two. And when you break out, you use more to cover it up, which caused the skin to break-out more.Bare Minerals was so light, yet it covered up all problems (age spots, red spots, acne, etc). And then you get a benefit from the product, it actually reduced the acne, the red spots. In the end, I actually use less of the product than when I first starting using it, because my skin is actually looking better. Who would have thought? buy it, you'll like it."
2,Stay away if you have sensitive or oily skin,"I too got sucked in by this overly-advertised product. While it did reduce the appearance of large pores, it irritated my sensitive skin which itched like crazy. Also, this product seems to make my oily skin appear extremely oily even with the mineral veil applied over it. The concept of mineral makeup is wonderful but perhaps this product needs more refinement."
2,Not a good value,"With shipping & tax, this purchase topped out over $30. I assumed it would be a full size version of the powder tin as you would see in the stores - it isn't. It is like a little tester version, maybe 1/3 the size I was expecting - steer clear, this product can't sell on the counter at the price they charge, so they are selling it over the web..."
1,Terrible for Sensitive Skin!,"If you have sensitive skin, BEWARE! This product gave me dermatitis after using it, and it took me weeks to get rid of it! My skin is extremely sensitive and so many people swore by it but I will never use any Bare Escentuals product again. If I had to keep one thing from what I bought, it would be the Mineral Veil (due to the reflective properties). I've had a much better experience with GLOMinerals and didn't experience any of the irrtation that I did with Bare Minerals. I will never buy this product or any Bare Escentuals product again. Unlike the very long infomercials, this product is NOT PERFECT FOR EVERYONE and can cause irritation."
2,Cakes oddly after a few hours,"I've seen this recommended before, but it didn't work for me. After a few hours, it cakes oddly on top of your skin, so that it looks like a film is floating on your face. Not a good look. Maybe my skin is too oily for this."
5,Bare Minerals Foundation,"This is the best make-up you'll ever use. Light and natural, it won't clog your pores and is even fine to leave on overnight. The Amazon price is the lowest price you'll find."
3,good but not excellent,"hey :) this shade (Fair) is very natural on my skin tone which is nice, and it covers well. a little goes a long way. only thing is i only apply it to my uneven skin tone right on the right and left side of my mouth (from the bottom of the nose to the bottom of the mouth)-- at the laugh lines.. and unfortunately, it does crease into the lines after a little time which i dont like. so i rate it good but not great. however, if you apply it with a brush, of course, to an area which does not have any lines or wrinkles, you should be happy with it, no probs :)"
1,not impressed,"I've used this for 2 months now, and I have to say I'm not impressed. I have to apply more than suggested to get medium coverage, and by mid-day.. its like it has washed off and I have no makeup on, and I have to re-apply! It also has a very shiny sheen look to it, which is okay in person, but I spend most of my day in front of cameras and it makes my face appear oily as if theres no makeup. I don't recommend."
5,Loves it,I bought this for my daughter. She requested it as a gift because she uses it...she now wants me to buy her more! It must be good. It's lasted her more than a year.
2,"Love the product, not Flawless Beauty","I absolutely love bareminerals, but I don't really like the price so I was trying to find it cheaper then $25. I had about a week of foundation left so I went ahead and ordered the Medium shade from Flawless Beauty and they sent me Warm Tan - not even close! I had to ship it back and wait for them to receive the returned item before they would ship a new one. Long story short, I ran out of this foundation and had to go buy it at Sephora anyway. They did finally send the correct product but it was a hassel - I'd much rather pay the extra $5 then order from this company again."
4,useful product; good coverage,"I really like the product's LACK of scent. It's also very easy to blend--no lines, no streaks unless you are really clumsy. It is easy to apply once you get used to it, and it did not irritate my allergies. I'd go to a Sephora counter just to test-drive it, since some people seem to have had extreme reactions to the bismuth, but this is a godsend for those of us whose allergies are more to petrochemicals. It evens out my patchy skin nicely. it gives you a little perk of color--i looked a little tanned but still like myself.It's not a complete coverage makeup, but somehow even the imperfections don't seem so bad. I was hoping that no one would be able to see my facial scarring, but it's still visible (though not very noticeably). maybe the problem is just my hope to erase all the damage."
3,Not bad,"This makeup does not offer a lot of coverage. put too much on and its EXTREMELY visible and looks cakey. Does brighten skin up, however, if you have naturally clear skin. Should not be used with dry skin because it will enhance this even if you moisturize"
2,Sent wrong color,"I was happy to receive it as I was out and needed to take some along on vacation only to find out the wrong color was sent and it did not work with my complextion. I didn't look at it closely upon receiving it as I took for granted that the right color was sent, thus throwing out all of the packaging it came with so I was unable to return it.Next time, I will be sure to look closely to make sure the correct color was sent. Only for that reason....I was dissappointed."
2,"NOT a click, lock, go sifter","This product was shipped quickly, however it does not contain the new Bare Minerals sifter design. There are only holes that are always open on this product, which is disappointing because it says it is the new click, lock and go sifter."
3,Smaller size than expected,"What was sent was more of a sample size with no click, lock, go sifter. I should have looked at the detailed description better."
4,BareMinerals Sifter Foundation,I love this product! It's always a go to foundation.I recommend this product for anyone that needs minimum coverage.
1,I will buy it from the real company,It wasn't the same makeup that I get from Bare Escentuals. It was the same packaging I think but the makeup was very different.
5,I love bareMinerals!,I love this product because I can match my skin tone and get the coverage I look for from my makeup. I've been a bareMinerals customer for many years and I do not see myself changing any time soon!
5,Great Product!,"I have been using this product exclusively since 2003. It goes on very light yet provides good coverage. I have very oily skin and I have not had to reapply, even after a workout. Prior to using mineral foundation, I used Estee Lauder's ""Camouflage"" foundation and Bare Escentuals coverage is just as good. Liquid foundation tends to settle in around the wrinkles, hence making us appear older.To the women who used Bare Escentuals and claimed it made them look older - they probably have very dry skin or used a shade that was too light, or applied too much. I have recommended this product to all of my friends and they love it, too. I am completely sold on the mineral foundation! I would never use the liquid type again."
2,I wasn't impressed by this product.,"In a nutshell, Bare Minerals did indeed provide good coverage, but the color of the foundation (fair) was very flat on my skin. It didn't provide that glow that I had expected, but instead a dull, flat color. The bronzer only made my skin look unnatural with my fair complexion. I have combination skin, and I also found that even after a couple hours of wearing Bare Minerals, it became cakey in my most oily spots, and built up in the creases of my nose. The makers of Bare Minerals say ""It's so light you can sleep in it."" Well I wouldn't recommend sleeping with this product on your face. YOU WILL BREAK OUT. Overall.. I wouldn't recommend paying $25+ for this product."
2,Oily & Cakey,"At first I loved bareminerals and pur minerals. But after only a few hours My face feels so gross and oily. It feels very heavy on my skin. I can't wait to get home and take it off everyday. That is not how you should feel about your makeup. I switched to Neutrogena's mineral makeup and so far love it. It is missing 2 ingredients that the other mineral makeups have and I think that is what makes the difference. It's light and covers well. The only thing is the lady at Ulta told me to get a light concealer then the foundation, well that was wrong, I looked like a ghost. I am getting the same color today."
4,Easy to use,"I've used this product for a while now. Tried others but they aren't the same for some reason. This goes on so light, you don't even know you have makeup on!"
4,wasn't what I ordered,"The product itself was fine but the original order was lost in the mail and when it finally came two weeks late, it was not the shade I ordered."
2,I don't understand the hype,I have tried to like this foundation. I understand that many women love this stuff. I find that is is caky on my skin. Also the color is not quite right. They seem to think their fair shade fits all fair skin gals and it just doesn't. In certain lights it looks blotchy and yellow on my skin.
5,Love it !,I've been using this product for 12 years and would be lost without it. Everyone I've convinced to try it has loved it as much as I do and they are all hooked.
4,Easy to use but not for all faces,"My thanks to MJ for the extensive review and the common sense advice about skin care. I have used Bare Minerals Foundation and Soft Focus for several years on my normal-to-dry face with generally very good results. I agree with those who caution about expecting this product to hide or cure all face problems. My complexion is texturally smooth with some unevenness of color due to age, and the products have done well to minimize (NOT HIDE) the imperfections. I like Bare Minerals ease of use and the way they feel on my skin, so I accept the incomplete concealment. With a couple of other people, I find that as I age, I have to use the powders with more care, since even a little too much can accentuate lines and shadows. At some point, I'll probably have to abandon powder makeup, but until then, I'll stay with the Bare Minerals products that have been so good for me."
3,Like the results but sensitive to it,"Hi, i am 33yrs with combination skin normal/oily tzone. I just purchased this product a few months ago. I had a make up session at Ulta and was very pleased with the results. After wearing the makeup for a few hours i went back and bought the starter kit. They are right when they say using less is better. When i tried to use more i had that really dry and cakey look. The last time i put BareMinerals on i noticed some slight itching and irritation, especially within the creases on each side of my nose. I thought this was weird because i didn't have this irritation the day i had the make over at Ulta and i used the same products they used. I had to wash it off because it seemed to be getting worse and as soon as i took it off the itching was gone. I really like the natural look of this product and wish i could wear it but i guess i'm sensitive to something thats in it. Seems like good makeup and happy to hear many women with positive results."
2,Not the Best Mineral Foundation,"I love minerals make up because it is light and you do not feel like you are wearing make up. I have light skin with golden undertones. I used Bare Minerals fairly light foundation.Bare Minerals goes on smooth and blends well and looks natural. Bare Minerals sits on top of your skin and makes your pores look bigger. Unlike the commercials claim you do not ""look as if you are not wearing make up"" in fact your look like you are wearing tons. It is a natural look but still a make up look.Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips & face). It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price."
3,Sensitive Skin Users Be Cautious!,"A friend and I both bought the light/fairly light bareMinerals kit which includes this foundation. We both have sensitive skin prone to redness. I loved the feel and application of Bare Escentuals. Once you get the hang of it, it is so easy to apply. The look and coverage was fantastic for the overwhelming weightlessness of the minerals.After a few hours of wearing the minerals, though, both of us had crazy itchiness on our faces. After a day or two of wearing it, my skin got really red. I looked up some reviews online and I guess this is a common reaction for people with highly sensitive skin due to an ingredient, bismuth oxide. So please test this before buying it.If you do not normally have sensitive skin, ENJOY, because it does provide great flawless coverage. --JRD"
3,Not A Concealer,The television infomercial claims that bareMinerals can cover up blemishes such as redness or broken capillaries. It does provide medium coverage but concealer is still needed for dark spots. Swishing the brush on the powder in the tiny lid and tapping the brush of excess powder creates quite a mess unless you lean into a sink.
2,"It is ok, but overrated","I tested it first on the sensitive inner side of my upper arm after reading the bismuth oxide warning someone posted on this site, but did not have an adverse reaction, so I went ahead and tried it on my face. I was less than impressed. It evened out my skin tone somewhat but also did make my pores look larger. I do not think I will buy it again. I have had better results with drugstore brand foundations (such as L'Oreal's True Match) and I do not think this is worth the price."
1,no thanks!,"I tried this product after I heard people raving about it and was not pleased at all. It made my skin look very shiny, even after I used the mineral veil. Also it accentuated every little line and pore. I thought it must be my application technique, but tried several times exactly as instruced, it just did not look good. Would not recommend this product to anyone over 35....(I am 42)"
2,Not that great,"I bought this foundation at Ulta awhile back and I'm NOT pleased with it. It does not cover blemishes or redness, and makes my pores look huge. I would NOT reccomend this to anyone with dry skin, as it it makes you look like a flaking beast. I tried Clinique's Soft Finish foundation and am much happier."
2,Coverage lacking in this mineral-based foundation,"I wanted to like this product so much after reading all the glowing reviews here and on Makeup Alley; however, bareMinerals is just that -- too bare for anyone who needs decent light to medium coverage.No complaints about the color match. No complaints really about the effect on skin quality or health (I didn't wear it long enough to notice breakouts or any other reactions). The real complaint is that bareMinerals was too sheer and should not be recommended to women unless they have unwrinkled skin, teeny-tiny pores, and no blemishes or imperfections to cover.BareMinerals just didn't cut it for me although I'm sure it works well for women with skin that's good enough not to need foundation in the first place."
2,bareminerals,It seems like this product is diluted. I usually get my bareminerals from sephora but decided to try this- never again.
5,"Best Foundation, hands down.","I absolutely love BareMinerals. After several years of using it, I can't imagine ever using anything else. It's lightweight but with heavy duty coverage. It's reasonably priced for how long it lasts. It's actually enjoyable to apply, unlike heavy liquid foundation, but it's never flaky like powder. Love."
1,Instant aging,I've never put a product on my face that instantly added 20 years to the look. Suddenly I had lines and wrinkles that I never saw before. All the moisture was sucked out of my face pulling it taut. Horrible! I even tried several different shades and colors. All of them did the same thing. Who are these people trying to kid?
1,Thought I was the only one who didn't like this,"1 star for the warmth powder. If you're fair skinned and want to look slightly bronzed the warmth powder is good, but you have to apply it very lightly. The rest of it, like some others have already mentioned, doesn't necessarily live up to the infomercial's claims. I realize now that I should've gotten the primer lotion to use with it. But how great can it be if you have to buy more stuff in order to make it look right? The best foundation I've tried is by Bobbi Brown."
4,Good foundation,It looked so natural. And this stuff won't hurt your skin if you leave in on at night. It's a really good deal over buying the things seperately as well.
3,Not what I expected,"Although Bare minerals offers good coverage it cakes up on the first sign of moisture. It also tends to settle into pores and unlike the infomercial claims it DOES leave you with the ""line of demarcation"". I would say it makes a better concealer than an all over foundation."
1,Looks great for awhile but everyday wear produces cystic acne,"Applied sparingly this does look nice and photographs well but some component of the powder made me itch and burn and resulted in some very painful contact dermatitis/acne that took a week to clear. In fact some of the fallout from my use of this product left scarring. I do not recommend. Look around on make-up review sites and see for yourself. My story is repeated over and over by other women who wasted money on this product. This stuff is very, very irritating and applied heavily it does not look natural or good. For being photographed maybe. Otherwise little to no make up or a quality tinted moisturizer with SPF is the way to go. BareMinerals claims are too good to be true and they are not worth the potential havoc for your skin."
1,Try this instead...,"I tried and was patient with bare minerals but still found it to be drying-even when I switched to a heavy moisturizer it still looked terrible and felt so dry like my face couldnt breath also. So I went to the mall and tried out Pur minerals and their line of products. Tried and true pur minerals is AMAZING. I can wear my regular moisturizer, dont need a seperate concealer, and it looks airbrushed just like bare minerals...without the dry feeling. Pur minerals has shea butter in it which helps hydrate and I highly recommend the mineral spray which has vitamins and essential oils to spray on after you apply your mineral makeup and it sets it. The spray is awesome I spray my face to rehydrate about every 5-6 hrs and pur minerals wears ALL DAY litrally!!!! Try it and the best thing is its half the price of bare minerals!!!!! Try it and you will be sold I promise..."
3,cj,It was fast shiping but i do want to say the security sticker device they left on it when i was trying to take it off due to its a Christmas presant for my wife while taking it off it left a sticky residue on the lid and while trying to get that off the I on the lid rubbed off. Now it says d. Bare Minerals.
1,to much beige without natual covering,The price may be right but it doesn't work for me. I have olive tone skin color so maybe it works better on someone with fair skin. I find it to look thick and way to yellow.
3,none,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300
1,Not for the Sensitive,"I never write reviews, but I'm tired of Bare Minerals touting how safe it is for everyones skin! Got this last year. When I applied it I thought, ""oh nervana finally a product that lives up to its claims"". It looked absolutely fabulous. I loved it! That was before the skin burning & itching started. I tried using it again, same result, had to wash my face immediatley. So maybe Bare Minerals doesn't bother everyone but I now have scars to show it's not hypoallergenic on my skin. If you must try it, use with caution!"
2,No dice,"While this stuff does feel pretty nice and could look good as just an overall powder, I looked at myself in better lighting and actual sunline and saw lines I never knew I had! I'm 27, and let me tell you it looked like I suddenly aged quite a few years. Basically rubbing powder into your skin isn't helping things. I use the cheapest crap foundations, but I use very little and do it right -- hence it seems to work just fine. I'm sure most of the glowing reviews here are by the company itself, or women who just don't have very good lighting to see what they actually look like with this stuff caked on. This foundation is okay in very small doses after applying mositurizer, but I wouldn't dare rub it near my eye area again. It also makes my skin look drier, but moisturizer seems to help a bit. Try a sample from Ebay before you drop $25 ladies!"
3,Old product design,"In the last year or so, Bare Minerals came up with a new container design, and the item shipped to me was in the old container. This can only mean that the product is at least a year old, if not more. I'm sure it is just fine, but that's the reason it's cheaper than what you find at Ulta or Sephora."
1,Buyer Beware of Saftey issues,"This product contains Bismuth, which is a by-product of lead and copper. Absorbed into your skin could cause skin problems and thyroid issues.Ultimately, Bleach and alcohol are natural products, but I don't want them on my face either."
1,Horrible,"Upon first buying this product- a hefty $60 plus tax- I was very excited to use it! I wore it for a while, and got numerous compliments on how healthy my skin is looking. However, a few weeks later I started to notice that I was breaking out everywhere! I have good skin and have never had a breakout as bad as this. I have little clumps of whiteheads together on my cheeks, zits on my chin, forhead, and hairline! It is absolutely disgusting, it won't go away even though i discontinued using this product around 3 weeks ago. Now I have to go to the dermatologist so I can be prescribed retinol for my acne. I definitely do not recommend this AT ALL."
4,one of the best but....,It is one the best foundations I have ever used..esspecially during summer time..but as I travl overseas and the security restrictions apply I have to put them in to my luggages and when the time comes to use them they become messy..please find another way..
2,Cakey on larger pores,"I so wanted to like this makeup, but it looks the most obvious of any foundation I've worn. My pores are nowhere near invisible, and that might be why it looks cakey on me even though I apply it exactly as taught and wait a few minutes after moisturizing. It is also extremely messy...the powder disperses through the air and gets everywhere. Also, for some reason i don't find it ""illuminating"" at all...I even thought i must have bought the matte version by mistake.I won't be buying this again."
1,Worst foundation ever!!,"I'm am 22 with no wrinkles or fine lines and occasionally have a blemish, this foundation gave me awful lines on my face (especially around my eyes) made my pores look large and doesn't coverage blemishes as good as it claims. It also doesnt last, even with the bare mineral primer. Not worth the money!!!!!"
5,love it,I have used it for a long time and I will keep coming back for more. I have sensitive skin and have had VERY little break outs.
5,LOVE BareMinerals,"I absolutely love bareminerals. It doesn't irritate my skin and lasts a really long time, which makes the price more reasonable."
4,Will never use another make-up,For me there is no other make-up on the market and I will continue to use this for as long as possible.
1,NOT FOR DRY SKIN!!,"As I've stated on other websites, this product is NOT for dry skin!! I plunked down $250 to try it all and try it all I did. I gave it months of trials trying to get my skin to look wonderful like the infomercials..I would even have settled for my skin looking a tad better than it did. No dice. It caked, it stuck to my dry patches, it streaked, it did nothing for the dark circles under my eyes, it made my face look floury like a clown and I hated all of it and it all sits wasted in my closet. There is NO miracle makeup, different makeup works differently for different types of skin and I can't see how this dry powdery substance with no moisturizing qualities would even remotely look good on dry skin."
3,"Not For Lined, Aging Skin","I am 63 and really wanted to try this. I swirled and tapped and noticed that the places on my face that are Not lined turned out nice. But I wanted a little more coverage due to some spider veins and 2 age spots. So I put a second coat on and these lines under one eye really stood out! I didn't know I had them until I used this product! So I got some makeup remover and took off the bare minerals that was on top of the lines and they disappeared! On those, I put my regular liquid foundation (on the lines)and all was well.I think you should have nearly perfect skin for this to work nicely."
2,"Itchy, gives a very 'made up' look, not so great coverage","Like a number of the other reviewers I had hoped that this product would be a miracle powder that would give great coverage but be invisible. I found that it gives a look that is nice from a distance, but looks extremely powdery close up and totally fails to cover my freckles and dark spots i.e. the sun damage on my skin. Like another reviewer, it also makes my skin itch.The most annoying thing I found is that, no matter how little I used, the powder seemed to 'migrate' down my face and end up on my mouth. I ended up constantly rubbing it in clumps off of my lips. Yuck. No other powder I have used has ever done this. This was $25 not well spent. If you are thinking of buying it, try someone else's first if you can."
1,bismuth oxychloride- not natural! BAD,"I have used this stuff for 2 years thinking its ""good"" for my skin! only to find out after some research (finding the ingredients was a task in itself), that it contains a lead byproduct that irritates and causes breakouts! how annoying!!! they claim its ""natural"" and free of chemicals, bull!!!! there are other mineral make-ups out there that do not contain bismuth oxychloride. [...]. If you have problem/blemished skin, i would avoid this bismuth oxychloride, as it states it specifically ""can"" cause break-outs. uggg...."
3,bismuth oxychloride allergy,"I actually liked the make-up, but I started breaking out and my face would sweat a lot and burn. Turns out I am allergic to bismuth oxychloride like many other people are. Also, this ingredient makes your face look more shiny, thus the need for the mineral veil. There are many other mineral make-ups out there that do not contain bismuth oxychloride. I can still use the eyeshadows and eyeliner."
4,Matte's better,"The last BareMinerals I ordered was Matte, I ran out so I ordered some more not realizing it wasn't the Matte. This is good but I definitely prefer the Matte. I really like bareminerals for my skin which is pretty clear, not oily, not dry, just regular. It works good for me."
2,Looks great but made my skin so bad,"Looks fantastic on but contains bismuth oxychloride which causes acne... big time!! Most people don't find this an issue, but I sure did. I don't even have sensitive skin but boy did it dry me out and make me break out.... everywhere!!! I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal."
4,Great color,"Not quite as smooth as the original, but still works well. I really like the increased color options, this shade matches much closer than the original light."
2,"If you like Medium Beige, you will NOT like Fairly LIght!","I purchased the Fairly Light after much research in trying to determine color. I finally surmised it was in the same color family, just lighter than the Medium Beige, which has worked just fine for me for some time. I thought the Fairly Light would be better for my lighter 'winter' skin color. WRONG. It looks pasty, and I feel like I look like I have makeup on. Generally I use the bisque concealer in the inner corners of my eyelids to offset the darker skin color there, and then down the sides of my nose and fan the bisque out towards my cheeks. Then allover with the Medium foundation using the big kabuki, then Warmth for blush using the baby kabuki, which I also swath across my eyelids. That's it, 5 minutes and I feel like I look natural but not tooooo natural (I'm 57) Anyway, the Med Beige is a great color, and evens my skin tone. May mix it with the F.Light to make my makeup last longer."
2,Completely Unimpressed,"I've tried this twice, and remain unimpressed. I bought a full size of it two years ago, but pitched it because the texture was so pathetic, and the powder comes off on everything and everyone (including anyone you hug or dance with).Tried it again last week, after getting a sample from Sephora through the Beauty Insider program. Sometimes first impressions of products are wrong. Well, I'm still unimpressed by everything about this product. The coverage is not great, the shades are not great, and the texture feels grainy and like it isn't going to stay in place all day. Not for me."
2,Kim,"The powder has a sheen to it and doesn't apply as good as the Pyscns fourmula I get at the store. I have mixed bare minerals w- other mineral powder to diminsh this sheen look whick added cakey-ness. Although it has great coverage, the sheen and cakey-ness made it seem not so natural looking. I'm very surprized I didn't care for it after I've heard so many grat things from other people on the infomercails.thanks for the quick shipping and great price...regaurdless of my feelings of the product itself.Kim"
3,What about ingredients??,"I always wanted to try Bare Escentuals products because of it's all positive reviews. However, I am very skeptical about the ingredients which they NEVER mentioned on their products! All they emphasize is that it's 100% mineral(..consisted of what??). Does anyone know about the ingredients??"
1,This makeup is not good,Listen this makeup is not good. It did not even look natural. My parents hated how it looked on me and it didn't cover up shine. So i suggest clinique makeup. TOTTALY BETTER
4,Like this product,"It is light and has good coverage. It is not a perfect skin match though, so it takes a little longer to apply. I do like this product though!"
5,Best makeup!,This is the best makeup I have ever used. It covers imperfections well and feels as though you have nothing on your face.
3,no coverage and clumped,"Store and tried this makeup before I bought it. It has no coverage and clumped up when I put it on my face, then I tried applying it with a brush and it did the same....I'd recommend trying it at a dept. store before you buy it here because you can't return makeup."
5,Great Product!,This is such a great product! It lasts all day without having to touch up and it's very natural looking. Started using this about a year ago and I'm hooked.
5,BARE MINERAL REVIEW,"PRODUCT CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION. JUST WHAT I ORDERED. IT WAS THE SHADE I WANTED AND WAS STILL SEALED WITH A PROTECTIVE CLIP, UNOPENED."
3,Different Formula?,"Item was right product, in perfect condition, and packaged properly but the coverage doesn't seem to be as good. Possibly B.E. has changed their formula since my last purchase."
4,Matched makeup in stores...,"Fast shipping. Store bought quality. Wish it was newer case which prevents spilling, but it is original case that I'm use to using."
4,Love BareMinerals Foundations,"Time and again this is the best foundation I've ever used. Great product, not too expensive, always get compliments on my skin when I'm wearing it."
5,The best foundation in the universe,I buy this brand all the time. It is the best! Buying here saved me about $5. Thanks!
3,Okay,"I used bare minerals for about a year, but have stopped now and am in the search for a new foundation. While, I liked bare minerals I found the whole tap, swirl, buff regimen quite a bore. Also, I felt the minerals were very messy. I did like bare minerals enough that if they came up with a new delivery system, such as the one used bay smashbox halo, I would try it again. This is a common complaint that have heard from others. The other issue is the BE makes your skin very matte. It is hard to get that dewy look from BE. I also found it did not cover as well as I would have liked."
3,Not for dry skin,"Let's face it -- there is no single solution for all women when it comes to make-up. We are all genetically unique so we have to find what works for our skin type. I find Bare Escentuals Bare Mineral foundation to be too drying for my (extremely) dry skin, a hereditary problem compounded by years of living in the desert. Furthermore, it seeps into the fine lines -- people with dry skin can understand what I'm talking about -- thereby highlighting those lines even more. I do like the light feel of it though by the middle of the day, it doesn't look like I have any on. In sum, it functions more like a powder than a foundation."
3,Like it but shades not true across all skin tones,"I love this foundation, the problem I have is that I'm more of a neutral skin tone but I end up getting the cool toned foundation because the ""fairly light"" is too light and the next neutral shade ""medium"" is too dark. So I end up getting ""fairly medium"" for cool skintones. It works alright but it's disappointing that the brand acts like each shade is the same except for changing it for skin tone-not so!"
1,hardly any product!,Product came packaged like new but had 3/4 of product removed! Have since heard similar stories regarding the company. Lesson learned.
3,"Great product, bad price","I got a sample of this at Sephora, and I do like the product a lot. It applies nicely and feels good, too, but at $25, I'm not too sure I'd buy it. I bought mineral powder makeup by Loreal for about $10 and am just as happy with that and the price is much better. But the coverage is nice and it does feel good on the skin. It's just a matter of how much you want to spend, but if I find something just as good at a lower price, I'm all for buying cheaper and using the savings for savings or more makeup."
3,Rinérse '- La Guitaristic House Organisation,"Rinérse 'made a splash with their guitar-stabby LA GUITARISTIC HOUSE ORGANISATION, and on this single, they hand remix duties to Terry Farley, who amps up the percussion and takes the track into a minor key. The chug of the liver version of ""Metal Mental Dub"" doesn't add much, but does suggest the level of energy present at their shows."
2,"Regretable, inconsequential micro skillet","Lodge makes a slew of USA made cast iron products, most of which are quite useful additions to any kitchen, and a very few of which are simply wastes of resources, time and attention. Regretably, this little 5"" square skillet falls into the later camp. It's ""oh-so-cute"", and yet, damned near useless, save for cooking individual eggs or heating a sandwich made from boring, bland SQUARE bread like Wonderbread. Actually, even Wonderbread grilled cheese sandwiches are better made with some other Lodge devices that serve multiple duties, such as any cast iron frying pan over 8"" diameter. That leaves this little 5 inch square as being square and basically useless, which it is. Avoid wasting even a dollar on this. The ""wonder"" in this pan is that it sells at all. I give it 2 stars, rather than one, only because it's made well and made here."
1,couldn't get it right,"i ordered one of these, and when it came, it was peeling! the peeling wasn't in the cooking area, but it bothered me, so i sent it back and ordered a new one. the replacement was even worse than the first one! it wasn't worth my time to try a new one, so i just gave up and sent it back. i hope others have better luck. or maybe i'm just too picky by wanting it to look nice too."
1,Lodge Logic Skillet,I need to find out if this product had any warranty against it being rusted after two uses.I used this pan about two or three times and found out that it had gathered rust.
2,"Cooks great, but ...","I like the size and even-cooking of this pan, but ...- The pan's handle becomes dangerously hot when cooking.- The pan's body rusts very easily and can then leave stubborn rust stains on your counter top.Some type of handle insulation would make this product much safer."
3,It's OK but really nothing special,"This skillet is a novelty and really not much more than that and after a few uses I hardly use it at all now. What really disappointed me was the fact it was supposed to ""pre-seasoned"" which I found out instantly was not the case. The first time I used it the eggs stuck to it lke glue. Doesn't ""Pre-seasoned"" mean that you don't have to use any spray oil or something like that or am I wrong about this? If I still smoked I'd use it as an ashtray in my backyard."
1,Horrible,This skillet was already scratched up when I took it out of the box. The coating just peeled right off. I can't even use it. Total waste of money.
5,"Raclette, anyone?","If you know about Switzerland's Raclette dish, this tiny pan may be the best and most-long-lived large raclette pan in the world (large compared to other raclette pans that is).Besides it's just about the right size for a large Toast Hawaii :)."
4,It's cute,"This is perfect for a grilled cheese sandwich but if you're used to a nonstick skillet, it will stick. Mainly it's a cute skillet for one person."
4,perfect for its size,I luv this little pan. Read the specs and get a ruler. Great for a single sandwich.
5,Love it!,"The size is perfect for small meals for my kids! It fits 1 grilled sandwich, a small portion of scrambled eggs, a small stir fry, etc. I chose the cast iron to increase the amount of iron in their diet because they are very picky vegetarians. It takes a little more work to clean just because you can't put it in the dishwasher and you have to scrub a bit, but it is not a big deal at all."
3,"Very Good Basics, but outdated","Pros:Simple; Love the simple explanations on how it all works. I now can envision each part!Cons:Simple; Too simple for anything but an introduction.Outdated; 1976 was almost 25 years ago. Gas is no longer ""very inefficient""! Many new building methods (like metal hangars and braces now required) and materials not covered (PVC pipe, glues, radiant heating).Overall: great quick read and I learned lots (that I hope is still correct :( )"
3,a reminder certainty was never certain,"A well written book given its academic nature exposing the flimsy threads holding together the rather cold philosophy of scientific positivism generated not just by philosophers and scientists at the begining of the 17th century but giving a clear and tragic reason for its founding and eventual decline. A must read for science students given the persistence of this earlier, discredited philosophy and its pitfalls. The difficulty of current scientists, especially popular writers, to face the truth of the matter makes this book a timely addition."
3,Not for use on wood floors,This item's packaging specifically states it is for use on carpeting ONLY!The description implies it is usable on ALL surfaces.Do not buy for use on wood or laminate floors!
2,Schumacher Is At It Again,"From the man who ruined the Batman series comes another waste of time. Nicholas Cage contributes heavily to the awful stench that permeates from 8MM with his dramatic over acting and stiffness. 8MM tires its hardest to be dark, edgy, and surprising, but fails at all three. Luckily, Joel Schumacher decides to explain the entire movie to you at the end with his character ""Machine"" giving you the entire synopsis behind his mischief, much like a James Bond villain. If you enjoy abusing yourself with obnoxious and tiresome movies, then 8MM is definitely for you. However, if you like movies that are entertaining and have a redeeming quality, stay away from 8MM."
4,better than its reviews,"This movie is clearly better than its reviews. It may be too slow and too unsetting to be seen in a theater, though."
2,Not Cage's best.,"This movie was okay, I guess. It's not Cage's best. I wouldn't like to call it his worst since it's not all THAT bad, but this is my least favorite Nicolas Cage movie. Boy, Schumacher did it again, huh? First he ruined the Batman series, and now he blemishes a great actor's filmography. If David Fincher would have directed this (not because he's my favorite director or anything; this is just his kind of movie cause he did such a great job with the dark atmosphere of ""Seven""), this could have been one great movie! Lousy Schumacher... he outta stick to his John Grisham novels and leave the cool things alone cause all he does is ruin them. The film is disturbing and it's a little effective cause you feel so sorry for the girl and her mom, but it's just lacking a story and just drags on. A good movie to rent, but if you wanna buy it, wait till the price drops a little. Lousy Schumacher..."
3,"Surprisingly engaging, make that three and a half stars","This movie got panned so much by the critics and audience that I had low expectations. I got it anyway since I found the subject matter interesting. I was pleasantly surprised to find it a riveting suspense flick that took a surprisingly candid take on a distasteful subject.Nic Cage does a good job as a P.I. sucked into the seedy world of perverts, pimps, and whores only to find a disturbing affinity to that which repulses him.Two standout supporting roles are played by Joaquin Phonenix as a reluctant porno-clerk-cum-sleuth and James Gandolfini as a sleazy L.A. pornographer."
4,excellent for home viewing,"Nicholas Cage gives a good performance in this story about snuff movies.Keeps you interested from beginning to the end.For home viewing, the movie is very intriguing and should be seen by all."
2,Great concept...but then it was all downhill,"Schumacher really should stick to his day job (producing) and not directing - purlease!!! This was a good idea and casting Cage was cool. He did the best he could in an ill-scripted and ill-conceived film. The insight into the dark and murky world of 'snuff films' was interesting and a very brave topic to tackle on the big screen in front of mainstream audiences. But as a film its very disapointing. As seems to be the trend these days; it starts well and then just loses its head and disintegrates (slowly) on screen for what actually seems like the next 2 hours!! By the end of the film I had lost all interest in any of the characters and just wanted this rubbish to finish. The editing was terrible and the direction was lousy - at best.If you're thinking of watching this film, go and see EVERYTHING ELSE you've thought of watching before wasting your time on this one."
2,Good - But not great,"The basic premise of this film was, it seemed, to shock an revile, it should have but it failed. Unforetunately we live in the 90's real world, and while we may debate on whether snuff films actually exist, sickos portrayed do exist and heroes like Cages' character do not. The plot, story, cast and the acting were excellent, as was the potential of the execution, but the end product was a major let down. If you want realism look out for Tim Roth and Ray Winstone - Hollywood still has a lot to answer for."
3,"Great movie, but to strong","It had good acting, but the theme is to strong and the movie was to sick, i always knew sick porno phreaks existed, but this is way beyond my expectations. This movie was sick, but its a very big wake up call to american parents, to take care of there children and treat them well through their teen years. Good movie, but a strong movie"
2,Well...,"This was certainly not a masterpiece. However, I cannot go and rate it one star because the story is quite good. They should have insisted a lot more on the video, and shown us the pictures or the film, really, that WAS the movie.8mm didn't please me like I thought. I had many good comments, but after watching it, i didn't find it too weird or too scary. I had a bad feeling with the ending. One of these endings you just ask you if the producer is crazy or what..."
3,"Well, ""disturbing"" was pretty accurate...","I immediately saw the similarities to ""Hardcore"" but thought this was certainly much more disturbing. Of course it was, because of the subject. It was very slow paced, and the acting was pretty good at conveying a feeling of very deep, dark, twisted emotions. Pretty good plot twist at the end.Several moments made me feel very scared about things that actually exist and could happen to my 4 year old daughter. But isn't ""thinking"" what films are supposed to do?"
3,Ugh...,"The most accurate description I can give of this movie is that it makes you feel like you need to take a shower, then dry off and take another one... Repulsive but watchable."
1,Why? - another example of media gone bad,"Simply put, this movie self-destructs. All that can be said is that it must have read well in script format. The issues that it brings up demands a director with better respect for the intelligence of any audience. Considering the self-importance of the director audio - anyone who respects the idea of film exploring serious issues will note the instructional value of what not to do. One can't blame the actors/writers on this vanity project. One wishes that function meant more than form here - Although not perfect, spend your money on ""Summer of Sam ""instead ... atleast Spike tries that little bit harder and respects an audience more."
1,utter dreck,"Andrew Kevin Walker who wrote the fine ""Seven"" stumbles here. But he had help. The film, a lurid journey through the sexual netherworld, becomes bogged down almost immediately by starchy dialogue and forced performances. Nic Cage painfully overacts here. See his reactions while watching the eponymous film alone, unable to voice his disgust. Or the way he wipes his fingers on his coat after handling pornographic snapshots. Hardly subtle. Schumacher must shoulder some blame here. From behind the camera he must have seen his actors getting away from their roles and should have reined them in some. Self-conscious editing unfortunately does not distract enough from a story that decends into simple-minded gratuitousness and revenge fantasy. And an annoying sub-plot involving his wife mars the film further. One element of ""8mm"" that intrigues is the music, a blend of contemporary Middle Eastern rythyms, though it has no place in this film."
4,"Disturbing, but worth watching","The most meaningful thing I can say about this movie is that at the end of it, the entire cinema audience got up and left in complete silence. The only other time I have seen that is after Schindlers List. Watching Cage's character slowly try to get to grips with the appalling lack of humanity or compassion was fascinating enough, but witnessing him slowly being taken over by all he sees is morbidly compelling. At times I almost thought that I shouldn't be watching, as if I was intruding. Definitely watch this film, but don't expect to finish it with a smile on your face..."
1,i found it very over-rated,"This over-rated, if not cheesy, film left the same bad taste in my mouth that HACKERS and AMERICAN HISTORY X did. In both cases the filmmakers exploited something that they obviously did not know much about in the first place (the hacker and skinhead subcultures, respectively). That's what I didn't like about those movies and it's what I don't like about this movie. It's a glossy pseudo-sad (the ending is pathetic) movie that uses stereotypes of the porno industry to tug at heart strings. Also, Nicholas Cage suffers from extreme over-acting the entire time. I would have given this negative stars but that just isn't possible."
3,Quite dark and intense.,"This was a pretty good film that was dark and surprising. Reading about the plot beforehand, I knew that it would probably be interesting and not run-of-the-mill. 8MM isn't a movie that I consider great, but it no doubt is still decent and not a typical movie. The subject matter is probably not for everyone and some of the scenes people may find disturbing though. That aside, this film was quite interesting and never seemed to lag or get boring. Nicolas Cage did a good job in his role and so did the actor that played the guy from the shop who helped him. I thought that 8MM was good mostly because it was different. I'm sure some people won't like this film, but if you're looking for a movie that's intense and keeps a good pace, then this is a satisfactory one. 8MM took some chances and is worth a watch."
4,Conclusion: Otherwise Mediocre Film that Causes Violent but Fun Dreams,"Pretty suspenseful film that takes you on a thorough tour of the illegal and semi-legal hardcore pornography industries. Much of the acting, Cage's in particular, is not that great, and the whole mood of the film is quite grim and virtually humorless. I wasn't going to bother reviewing this one because there isn't a lot else to say about it. Except this: The night after I watched ""8MM,"" I had a long succession of ultra-violent yet intriguing and ultimately entertaining dreams. I don't remember the specifics very well, but the atmospheres and plot-lines were, understandably, I suppose, quite similar to this film. I watch a lot of films of this type, but few affect my sub-c in quite this manner. So, if you're like me and occasionally enjoy intense, frightening dreams, I strongly recommend that you watch ""8MM"" sometime before retiring for the night!"
1,"Wants to be Se7en, but falls short.","With 8mm, it feels like Joel Schumacher(The Lost Boys,Batman and Robin) is trying to emulate Se7en. Both were written by Andrew Kevin Walker. But Joel falls short in this unpleasant, clichéd film. With Se7en, you were swept along with the characters. In 8mm, you can feel the hand of the director pushing you were he wants you to go. 8mm is blatant in it's attempts to manipulate the viewer, but is so clumsy you end up resenting it and the director for doing so. A film like this needs to be more subtle in it's attempts to coax the desired response from the audience."
2,definately not owner's material,"Even though I knew the story behind ths film before watching it, finally, I was overall appalled by it. I don't blame Nicholas Cage or director Joel Schumacher for doing this film. But I do think anyone who finds this film enjoyable, is probably pretty twisted, this is more of an experience than entertainment, in my personal opinion. Yes, I sat through the whole thing minus the credits and watched the making-of and trailer, but this film is not owner's material...for anyone, unless you're depraved yourself. Friends/family told me about this film, some giving me a warning about the content, but I decided to try it for myself, I don't regret that decision, but its definately a one time watch. I'm only keeping it in case a friend wants to borrow it, other than that, let it eat dust!"
3,disturbing,I thought this movie was disturbing because of the film that Cage watches and the places he goes to find out the horrible truth. it has great suspense though and Cage really puts the villians to rest. it deals greatly about underground porn and other sick things
1,IN THE LIST OF WORST MOVIES THIS ONE IS #1,"This is the worst movie ever, it's not that I can't stand the gore and violence, I own Seven on DVD, The Silence of The Lambs on VHS and I'm planning on buying Hannibal on DVD, when I saw the trailers for this movie and read that it had been written by the same guy who wrote Seven and given that this movie had an 8 in it's title I thought that it was going to be another great movie (don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a sequel to Seven or something related to that story in particular) but nope, this movie ended being the worst movie or one of the worst that I've seen in my whole life, I thought well on the good side we have Nicholas Cage and Andrew Kevin Walker, on the bad side the genius who directed the last two Batman movies, let's give it a try, it can't be that bad, well I was wrong."
2,Who did the music?,"At best this is a bad B-movie remake of Hardcore.But who did the music? the credits only list two peices, neither one of which apppears to be the arabic music all thru the film."
1,threw this one away,"-Public Service Announcement! Learn from my misfortune-I'm going to make this short and sweet, being that this movie is long and lame.Plot: kinda interesting. Well, no, I lied. I'm just trying to be nice. It's all about violent porn... um.... how bout go watch a porno instead?Acting: why in god's name did all of these actors shame there career with this piece of crap.Who would like it: .... people who like disturbing violent porn? and crappy movies? in the same package? and even then probably not.Who wouldn't like this movie: (your name here)That about sums it up. Suckage and disturbed hollywood at its finest!"
5,Cage Was Astounding...,"This dark tale of the underworld of pornography,and the weirdos it entales, follows a private detective Tom Welles (Nick Cage) who was hired by the widow of a millionaire, to track down a girl who is in a supposed snuff film. Det. Welles is quickly taken into the depths of thie hellish lifestyle as things begin to unfold, Cage does his most remarkable performance since 1996 in ""Face/Off."" Cage had long ago shown the entertainment fans that he was a powerful actor but incase they forgot this film quickly reminds. WATCH THIS FILM"
3,Not for the faint-hearted...,"Graphic Snuff Pornography. If you can get past the sex tapes that Nicholas has to view in this movie, and the rank places he has to go, then it is a good movie. The ending was worth the ""price of admission"". Definately not a move to have laying around available to the kids. If it wasn't for the end of the movie I would have given it 1 star. I'm a die-hard Nicholas Cage fan and love him in any movie.I do feel that it should have been rated NC-17 instead of R."
4,This is his best work,"To me, this is Nic cage's best wok to date. Just go out and rent it, and see for yourself...I'm sure you'll like it"
3,This is more than R!,"This is a really disturbing movie. The topic itself is a taboo, and obviously there are a lot of people like me, who have no idea of how dark the underground pornographic world can get. It does surprise me that this movie is only rated R. And I have to warn you that you have to be really mature to watch this.A lot of film critics don't like this movie. For this kind of movie, I guess the reviews are always in the extreme, either you love it or hate it. Well, most of you may think I'm being too generous to give it three stars.Joaquin Phoenix is great, and I think it is really brave for Nicolas Cage to accept this project. Obviously, this can hardly become a blockbuster, but surely, it gives you something to think and talk about after watching it. The best line of course, is ""You dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, the devil changes you""."
5,Best Film I've Seen in a While,The disturbing subject matter and the suspense put together make for a terrific and intriguing film.
1,SICK SICK SICK,"It had potential but it was so damn graphic. Nothing was left to the imagination. I have on of the strongest of stomachs, but snuff is a touchy subject matter and this film didn't handle it properly. As a huge Nicholas Cage fan, I was very disapointed."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"This is one of the darkest, grittiest, and scariest films I have ever seen. The reason? It's simple, this shit could actually happen! This probably has happened before! Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is hired by an elderly woman who finds a snuff film among her late husband's possessions. She wants to know if it's real and if it is wants to pay the family for her husband's mistakes. The investigation takes Welles down a deep dark road that few travel and even less know about. The story is just so dark and creepy that some of you might actually be freaked out by it! Cage is amazing as always, leading a terrific cast, that includes Joaquin Phoenix and Tony Soprano himself, James Gandolfini. It's a very strong story that will chill you to the bone. It's defiantly not for everyone, but it was right up my alley!"
5,Snuff rocks,"I don't care about what this film ""reminds"" the professional reviewer of, I like it. I understand that for a lot of people this movie is sickening, and there are quite a few cheesy parts (""Give me your permission to hurt them."" *rolls eyes* Stupidest line I've ever heard in a suspense movie), but I still can't help but be left satisfied. My favorite character is 'Max California', he was developed very well without much profound or psychological dialogue, and after watching 8mm I'm starting to EXPECT the demise of likeable characters in movies these days; it's getting tiresome. I still give it 5 stars."
4,8MM,"Disturbing and thought provoking. Not for you faint of heart people, but if you want to see what real life can be like for the thousands of lost girls (and boys, although that is not explored in this movie) who dream of making it big and end up ground meat in the porn industry, rent this movie.I recommend every parent see this film to realize just how precious their children are. The scene where Janet related how her daughter hated her stepfather and ran away just to try to find a better life broke my heart! Some better life she found. Dead at hands of a sicko to make a few bucks.I thought the film was well made and Nick Cage's performance was only rivaled by that of Joaquin Phoenix as Max. I would like to have seen the relationship between Tom and his wife explored further (that's why I only gave it 4 stars).Although I am sure it gave Tom nightmares, I too am glad he killed them. They deserved it. God knows our justice system wasn't going to do anything about it."
3,Disturbing but arresting....,"This in most defintely NOT a film I would recommend to everyone, but the fact remains, it is a hard film to stop watching. Cage is not at his best here, but the gritty dark cinematography adds disturbing realism to this view of the underground porno industry. Very graphic, perhaps too much so but a frightening view of ""every parents nightmare"" and a private investigators effort to find the truth of what happened in a short stirp of 8mm film. Compelling in it wayperhaps, but not, (very definetly NOT) for everyone...."
1,very bad,"can you give a film negative stars? cage is not my favorite actor, but he really under-does himself in this one. the script fancies itself to be clever, but it's just boring. there's no logical flow to the story. the banal plot ""twists"" are totally predictable, unimaginative, and just don't make any logical sense. the music is contrived and not very original. it is possible to deal with a disturbing subject in an imaginative and artistic way - but this movie isn't even close to either. if you never see this film, you will be a better person for it."
4,A Thrilling drama !,"I was outstounded after watching this film at the cinema last May. Although what critics say this film is one that has to be seen, it takes a very serious subject and turns it into a entertaining thriller, but it was the element of drama which I liked. Cage's performance is excellent as he portays a man and his obsession with a girl which was raped and murdered and was, to him, a complete stranger. Yes, it does deal with a sick subject, but it also raises a question that we all can relate to - how far would someone go to right a wrong? And to be very careful that 'that devil doesn't change you'. It takes a good look at what society is like today and just how sick the human mind can get.A must see film for all who can stomach it."
5,One of the BEST!,"This movie is one of the best I've seen. It is very original and worth seeing. Screw what all the stupid critics, 8mm may be a little disturbing but it was damn good. It is right up their with Se7en."
2,Know what you are seeing,"I thought that this film had a really good plot, Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Pheonix were both great and the cinematography was fairly good. However, all of this is unfortunately shadowed out by the disguesting subject matter. I honestly had no idea what a snuff film was when I went into the theatre. When I left (I walked out about halfway) I had a very good idea, to put it lightly. I'm sure that if you a) enjoy this type of violent pornography, or b) are desensitized to this type of violent pornography, then this is probably a good film. Basically, know this before you see it, because this is one of those movies (actually there aren't many)that you see and think, damn, how in the hell did that get an R rating? I found myself wondering this to myself many times throughout the film."
1,"The critics were correct, for once.","I'm not exactly the most discriminating movie goer. I watch -- and enjoy -- a lot of bad movies. That being said, 8mm is the only movie I've seen in the last two years that I felt was a complete waste of time and money.Nicolas Cage's performance is weak, the plot is unbearable, and the conclusion is predictable. The result is an unpleasant, mean-spirited movie that you won't want to watch all the way through.Avoid this movie. It's not even worth a rental."
3,Private eye gets tainted,"Nicolas cage gives the film a thread in his, out of the ordinary, 'quest' for the truth about an 8mm film.I found the acting reasonable to good from all of the cast and the lenses used on some shots really give an impression of being there and, most of the time, seeing some really unsettling things. This is the first film I ever saw where I stood up in the middle undecided whether to keep watching or not. Thankfully, not everything that happens to the characters in this film is entirely negative. It is quite difficult to say that it is a really good film or a poor performance. To conclude, three stars, I thought that the plot was conceivable, the script was pretty good most of the time and the actors did a good job presenting it. It shows a family man confronted with some really nasty stuff. The theme is therefore quite strong and it does deserve an 18/R rating."
3,"HOLLYWOOD FLUFF - NO LESS, NO MORE",Joaquin Phoenix cannot elevate this movie beyond your typical shock-fluff Schumacher watered-down throwaway
2,The Amazon review couldn't be more right,"This movie didn't even feel like it was trying to engage the viewer. I sat through the whole thing but just kept wondering if it was me or if the movie that was the problem. Afterwards, all of us who watched it talked and realized that, unbelievably, the director who had pulled off Se7en, had not been able to pull off THIS unappealing subject in movie format."
2,OK movie,"This movie was alright but Nicholas Cage didn't seem interested in anything. I just wanted to let people know that there really aren't ""snuff"" films. Most people wouldn't film the murder of someone, and then sell it. It would be too easy to track down the person who made it. Some deranged people videotape the torture of someone, but rarely does the actual murder rake place on film. I just wanted to let some of your minds at rest. One more thing, the Faces of Death videos are not snuff, and anyways, most of the clips are faked. There aren't usually multiple angles on things like that that are real."
3,A very disturbing film¿¿but,"To say this movie leaves you feeling bad is an understatement. However, this move makes you look and think about things that happen in real life and our overlooked or swallowed in the sea of apathy that is prevalent nowadays. Can you make yourself forget things you have seen and heard? Who knows its up to the individual to decide? Nicolas Cage does not give his best performance in this movie, but a solid performance nonetheless. This movie is definitely worth a look."
3,Disgusting,"I nearly vomited when watched this disgusting movie. Is that the director's will?? I must ask,and I really do not understand, why our director eagerly stress on evil side of the society so much, making this film all under a heretical atmosphere. And, the second half of it is full of blood. Cage, although with good performance, was very gray and negative here, both in tone, style, mood. This is an totally unhealthy film."
3,"I like Nicolcas Cage, but...","An expose of the ""snuff film"" industry, is that what we have hear? People who may get overly upset by what they see in this movie should look in they May/June issue of the ""Skeptical Inquirer"". That issue deals with the urban legend of the snuff film. In the early 70's a movie promoter thought that it would help his film if he hinted that the murders on film were real. He later had to put a disclaimer on the movie to the effect that no one was hurt during the making of the film. But by then the snuff film legend had momentum of its own.Do you enjoy pretending that they might exist because that makes the movie more exiting? Go ahead, enjoy yourself. But if you're concerned that there is some big snuff film industry out there, relax. The world does have troubles, but snuff films aren't one of them. If you're curious, check out the article on the Skeptical Inquiere website."
3,"good, scary thiller","phoenix and gandolfini are fabulous, their performances keep the movie afloat. cage, as usual, is a little melodramatic. exceptionally good soundtrack and cinematography."
1,Perverted Sick Movie,This movie shocked me with the amount of perversion. I am truely disappointed that Cage would be in a movie this .... I don't mind sex or murder. But the sex for murder is just sick. I pray that some crazy out there doesn't get any ideas!!!!
3,"Not bad, not great","First, let me say that I think Cage can't act, and I have yet to see a film in which he impresses me. 8MM is no exception. The film itself, ignoring Cage, is not bad, and although it has some interesting moments, it tries too hard to be scary. It isn't scary. It does offer a mystery, mostly surrounding the sexual underworld (if one exists...), but there is very little heart-thumping suspense. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I can't say I hated it. Of course, I hated Cage's acting (or overacting)."
2,What has happened to Nicholas Cage?,"First Snake Eyes and now this. It is not as horrible as the critics made it out to be, but is not up to the standard of many of his old movies. Watch Face Off, The Rock, Leaving Las Vegas, and Raising Arizona instead."
2,definitely not up to snuff,"A sick and disturbing film that actually is slow in places. I considered turning it off several times, but stuck it out to the anticlimatic end. My wife didn't watch it, but hearing the soundtrack from the next room upset her."
1,A Disturbing Subject Doesn't Make A Daring Film,"I've read reviews saying this is the most daring movie of 1999 but come on people just because it deals with a disturbing subject doesn't mean it's a daring film. Nick Cage's character was a brown nosed wimp who had Hollywood textbook reactions to everyone and everything. I don't even know why the writer had this character carrying a gun considering how scared and involuntary he was of using it, some pepper spray or a big ""HELP"" sign would have suited him better.If you want a story about a great PI then I suggested you refrain from buying or renting this movie and pick up a book from Robert B Parker's Spencer series. Read anything with Spencer in it then you'll be able to compare what a naive wimp Cage's character is."
2,Laughable and pretentious....should be in the comedy section,"This film is about the fakest snuff ever seen. I haven't laughed this hard at mock depravity since I saw an Insane Clown Posse music video.If the acting was any worse, I'd want them to kill me.However, what it lacks in conviction, emotion, articulation, and sincerity, it does manage to be stylish.But seriously- likening the whole SM scene to crazed murderers is really not fair. It's just more garbage pumped out to sustain a stereotype.This is not disturbing. If you think it is, you haven't seen much. Go rent ""Ilsa, she wolf of the SS,"" and then tell me this is disturbing. Rebeca on Sunnybrook Farm scared me more than this did. Barney and friends made me quiver in fear, this only put me to sleep.Something with substance, such as American Beuaty, Titus, or Magnolia should be garnering attention. This pretentious poof should be forgotten.Unless of course you're into mental slumming."
4,Nick Cage walks on the wild side... Again.,"8mm is a dour and depressing outing, but that doesn't stop it from being a good, well made, enjoyable thriller. (dour, depressing and enjoyable... Yes, as strange as that sounds) You might never crack a smile, but you should enjoy seeing Nick deal out his own brand of harsh justice.James Gandolfini plays a his Vicious Brute role once again, and very well. Peter Stormare seems to have the only on-screen fun as a bizarre director and Joaquin Pheonix is Sympathetic and Likeable as a Adult Bookshop Clerk who Introduces Nick to Hollywoods Grittier Side. Catherine Keener is a little Underused as Nicks Neglected wife and The man himself, Big Nicky, gets by with alot of Wrinkle-brow looks and Teary-eyed Expressions, but in the third act, he losses his grip (mentally, not performance wise) and his real acting skills shine.Overall, it's Definately not for all tastes. But for those with a high tolerence and a strong stomach, It's well worth a viewing."
2,Another Potentially Great film that never gets going,"This was the weekend of Potentially Great Movies, and Joel Schumacher's dip into the world of the infamous ""snuff"" film tops the list. It could have been an astounding movie, had it tried a little harder to break some barriers down (and had Nicholas Cage's role been better cast-- Cage just doesn't play a guy slowly having a nervous breakdown well) and been a little more subtle in its approach. As it was, it was a little too gratuitous, a little too exaggerated, and a little too detached. Which is too bad, because in the places where it shines, it really does shine."
1,Overblown and Glitzy,"The story really did have potential as well as the good actors involved, but Schumacher made it just another superficial ""hollywood blockbuster."" The subject matter is very dark, but the director didn't really use that to create a mood to the film. There was potential, but the results are very dissapointing."
1,Perverted and disgusting,"My rating of this movie is really zero stars. The synopsis on the back cover of this movie in no way prepared me for the journey into the world of those who find extreme graphic violence erotic. Even the edited scenes of the anonymous young girl who was butchered and murdered on film to fulfil a sick, twisted and perverted man's sexual fantasy were more information than I needed or wanted to know. I'm sorry I rented this movie!"
1,Doesn't live up to expectations,"This is really a let-down. Touted as the best Tristan and Isolde of the present generation, Heppner and Eaglen both fail to deliver the goods. Besides the extremely poor acting of the lead couple, the singing of Heppner is constricted and there's little variety in tone. Eaglen is even more disappointing, for her top notes lack force and her emotional response strictly one-dimensional. Indeed, I think that she's over-parted too.Levine and the Met forces are on good, but in no way exceptional, form. However, without two good principal singers, this opera cannot come to life, as has been the case here."
2,A mediocre performance,"I'm not too satisfied with this performance on DVD. The production is very static. (The poor acting doesn't help.) The singing is far below the standard of vintage Wagnerian performance. Levine and his band do better justice to the music. But on the whole, it is an uninspiring performance. Not that worthy to be presevered on video."
2,"Boring production, inadequate singing","I really find little to recommend in this dvd. The production is boring and undramatic, while the singing is often strained and unbeautiful. What's most disappointing is that the two lead singers neither look nor sound like the protagonists of Wagner's great music drama."
2,A dull production,"This dvd is just so dull! I'm bored by the directionless direction and the poor acting. Heppner is ok in the part of Tristan, but Eaglen is really not up to the task. Levine has been caught off guard (musically) in a few moments.I don't think this is really good enough to be released on dvd."
1,No match for rival version,"This release is not match for the rival dvd version with Meier and West as Eaglen and Heppner aren't as good as the former pair both in terms of singing and acting. In fact, this dvd is big disappointment, as the production is sloppy. I will not recommend this to anyone."
2,Inadequate casting,"I don't think that Eaglen and Heppner are good in this opera. Both do not have the requisite volume and stamina for the parts. Their singing is effortful and unidiomatic. There is also little attempt to act, which is important for a dvd production. On the whole, this performance is a bore. I won't recommend it to others."
2,dear oh dear,"one of my fondest wishes has been to see this work on stage. this dvd is the first representation i have seen. the staging is excellent. but it should have been released only as a cd and never as a dvd. the problem is that i find Heppner and Eaglen so repulsive to look at that i can only watch the drama in snippets. how different watching the Boulez Die Walkure with Hofmann, Altmeyer and Jones, all beautiful people who i can never tire of watching and empathizing with, such that each time i watch it i feel i have lived another life."
1,Wait for Voigt's Isolde,"There is no doubt that Jane Eaglen doesn't have the voice and technique for the role of Isolde. Her performance here is so bland and vocally precarious that I fail to derive much enjoyment from this dvd.I would suggest that those who like Wagner's great opera to wait for Deborah Voigt's Isolde, which is truly sublime. Then, you'll know that Eaglen is simply not ""the real thing""."
2,Tristan ohne Isolde,"Alas, Jane Eaglen just isn't good enough. We have yearned for so many years - since the retirement of Birgit Nilsson more than 20 years ago - for a really fine Heldensopran. But sorry, Eaglen isn't it, vocally or visually, and I don't mean just the tonnage. She's unattractive. I know, lots of us are not so beautiful, but then we are not presenting ourselves to a paying audience as the Shamrock that launched a thousand ships."
2,A generally disappointing release,"I was simply bored by this DVD. Even though I love Wagner's opera, I can't help feeling that the static production, which didn't work too well at the opera house, does not transcribe well at all through the video. Dramatic verisimilitude is further hampered by the acting (or non-acting) of the 2 principal singers. While Heppner provides some decent singing, Eaglen, greatly overparted in her role, sounds strained and uninvolved. The Met orchestra does a good job (as always) and Levine provides good leadership, even though his interpretation lacks dramatic tension."
2,Disappointing release,"This album is most disappointing. Heppner and Eaglen, touted as the best Tristan and Isolde of their generation, aren't really up to the demands of their parts. Their singing is unimaginative and musically bland. Yes, they hit all the notes (with a bit of strain here and there) but that's not enough for the opera. The Met orchestra gives a good performance."
5,Stumped!,"I was stumped when I heard this. Is Tristan und Isolde THAT good? Yes!! It is. Even after having heard Nilsson's legendary account, this Tristan has something DIFFERENT to offer. Not only DIFFERENT but also exceptionally BEAUTIFUL. You'll regret not hearing it"
2,Inadequate Isolde,"I'm disappointed with Jane Eaglen in the role of Isolde. She doesn't have the voice for the role. She sounds indifferent and can't act at all. It must be the blandest performance that I've seen. Heppner is better, but not exceptionally good. The others roles are merely adequately filled. Levine and his orchestra are in good form."
1,Great Disappointment,"I am going to tell it like it is. Here we have some of the most romantic music ever written, and we have a portly Tristan singing to a ""morbidly obese"" woman for over 3 hours. Opera is both visual and musical. You opera buffs that cling to the idea you go for just the singing is ridiculous. If I just wanted to hear the singing, I can buy the CD many times over.I want my Opera people to be real and for passion and sparks to fly off the stage into the audience.Check out or buy the Met's Tannhauser, and watch the interaction of Venus and Tannhauser in Act I. You will never look at another opera duet, and not think of them. Great passion and expression in that opera.Sorry, Opera is visual. I want real life looking lovers with passionate singing and expression."
1,Greatly disappointing,"This dvd is so disappointing that I have little urge to watch it again. The production is dreary and there is so little acting that, for such a long opera, it almost amounts to torture.Unfortunately, the singing provides little compensation, and especially Jane Eaglen, who doesn't have the voice and temperament for the part of Isolde. Heppner is ordinary. Even the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera House and Levine sound less than inspired.A forgettable release."
1,Mixed,"There were some things I liked in this production, but some things that drove me to just sell this DVD so I could get a different one. I know the standard ""Wagnerian soprano"" image is one of a fairly girthy woman, but good God there's a limit! The Isolde in this production is GARGANTUAN, which in itself is completely distracting considering Isolde is supposed to be this ravishing beauty who captures the heart of Tristan and the King. Between that and her horrible acting, the portrayal of Isolde in this DVD was not engaging at all (all she did for three hours was stand-sing-move-stand-sing with the blankest of expressions.) She is my main issue with the production; if it was another soprano who wasn't so morbidly obese and who was much more expressive physically and artistically, I probably would have ended up keeping the movie."
5,Must hear!,Must you hear it? Must you hear it? You must hear it!! You must hear it!!Just like Beethoven's last string quartet - must it be? must it be? It must be. It must be.I wouldn't say you must see this DVD. But you definitely must HEAR IT!! This is the best Tristan and Isolde ever. Definitely the best since Birgit Nilsson's definitive recordings.
2,I returned my copy.,"I was very disappointed with this DVD (and I'm not part of any conspiracies . . . that I know of). The singing was excellent, but everything else stunk, really stunk. E.g. acting, poor: 2d act in silhouette (and the staging in general), ridiculous (though Heppner with his nose and samuari hairdo looks like Wagner in silhouette, that was at least amusing): coughing in the audience, constant and loud (lazy sound guy?). It's as if they were trying to take as much passion out of the opera as possible without screwing up the music. Usually Levine and the Met are can't miss, but not this time."
5,Enough power and stamina,"Not enough power and stamina? Well, I suppose then that Tristan and Isolde should not be performed at all, right? Since nobody can meet the requirements.Fact is that Eaglen and Heppner are among the very few in years that have the power and stamina for their parts, and we should be happy that we have this on record since opera companies don't record operas anymore, esp Tristan."
5,Better than Voigt,I've heard the Voigt release under Thielemann. This is far far superior to Voigt. Not because Voigt is not good but because Thielemann holds back too much.Here Levine and Eaglen are an EQUAL match and that makes the results utterly thrilling!!
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON OR AMAZON SELLER!,"The 1 star isn't a comment on the movie but a warning to anyone considering buying it on this site. Twice I've tried ordering it and from 2 different sellers and both times they sent me the original Fred MacMurray version rather than the Harry Anderson remake.No doubt the original movie is the best, but you order a specific movie, you want that movie. Plus, you can buy the MacMurray version for a couple bucks or less, there's no excuse to buy that movie at the prices charged for this one!!!Just a friendly (if frustrated) warning."
3,Second Time is the Charm,"Original Towel Bar arrived with a defective finish on the copper towel rod. Amazon promptly provided for the replacement of the orignal bar and the return of the old. Support was fast and painless. The replacement is as advertised. In several years of using Amazon, this was the first time any order has had any issue. Amazon's swift action just made me more confident of purchasing a wide variety of products from them in the future.The defect in this towel bar was due to Moen, normally a high quality brand in plumbing fixtures. I also ordered several other Moen products with the same finish and all arrived in perfect shape.All is well that ends well but the three stars is for the added hassle of having to return the original."
5,Good Product - Simple Install,"This is a well made product that comes with template to help with the installation. The item comes with screws and accessories to install into hollow sheet rock wall, tile, or into one that might have a stud."
3,NOT 24 Inches,"The bar only measures 22 inches, which does not fit two towels folded side by side. I would have sent it back, but I ended up buying a separate 30"" bar from moen because I want the towel bar to match the rest of my kingsley accessories. Of course the separate bar is brushed nickel and my fixtures are antique nickel, but with towels on it's barely noticeable. If you do the same, make sure to get a 5/8"" diameter bar."
5,A Great Family Movie!,"Escape to Witch Mountain is a wonderful movie about 2 super natural kids named Tony and Tia.This movie is about Tony and Tia adventure as they try to find their ""people"" with the map in Tia's star case.With the help of Jake O'Day and the black cat,Winky they will began the search for their people.Bring this adventure into your home and enjoy this movie that will be talked about for a life time or more."
3,good - but much better if the FIRST of the series is seen fi,"I am seriously trying to find the video for which this is a sequel and mentioned in the review. it is the first of the series called ""Return to Witch Mountain"". I know it is in video format and so does your research info. Please can you help me SOON! i NEED THIS YESTERDAY. tHANKS A HEAP. fAITHMK@HOTMAIL.COM"
5,the escape,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND ITS BUNCH OF BONUS FEATURES. THE MUSIC ISN'T AS GOOD AT THE BEGINING LIKE THE SEQUIL BUT IT'S STILL BETTER. HERE ARE THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT:.IT HAS THREE OF MY FAVORIGHT ACTORS/ACTRESSES EDDIE ALBERT, IKE IESENMAN, AND KIM RICHARDS..IT IS THE PREQUIL TO A WOUNDERFUL MOVIE ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN""..IT IS IN THE VAULT DISNEY COLLECTION.TIA HAS THAT BEUATIFUL ""STAR CACE"".IT'S SET IN CARMELALTHOU THE COMENTAIRYS BOARING WHEN JOHN HOUGH IS SPEACKING."
1,I wished it were possible to give it zero stars......,"This movie should never have been made by Disney, and if they had they should have gotten Mr.Key to write the script. Then it would have been faithful to the real storyline from the book,and not the hatchet job that Disney did with an excellent book"
4,peek a boo,they were thought to be a bit slow but the bad guy didn't understanduntil he found out they were aliens. good fun.
3,"Dated, but Good for Kids","Our 8 year old loved it, even though it was dated. A nice, innocent movie. A kid movie without language or innuendos aimed at adults. What s concept!"
5,"Fantasy, extraorinary","The only reason I purchased the Witch Mountain series(Three films) is becausethey were produced by Walt Disney; needless to say, I am a devoted Walt Disney fan.Two children with extraordinary powers of clairvoyance come to the attentionof a dasterdly millionaire who seeks to lure the children to his estate in order toexploit these powers for his own purposes. Ray Milland aptly portrays this believable, money grabbing, character. While attempting to escape the clutches ofthis demon, the children meet a friendly camper, Eddie Albert, who takes thechildren under his wing. As the story of the children's origin and powers develops,the townspeople label them witchs. Then a totally other worldly person appears tosave the day; this person possess even greater powers than the children and proceeds to take them and the audience on a fantastic trip that is truly otherworldly and dazzaling."
3,BRAND NEW!,"the movie was brand new and in great condition, only down side was that it was in french! i apperently didnt see that when i ordered it, plus its format is region 2, so it cant play in the US. however if i could return it for english that would be splendid! :)"
1,ugh.,Apparently I bought the wrong version and it wouldn't work in any of my devices. I wasn't even offered a refund.
2,Singin In The Rain,Just great! Music was best I ever heard. Color is unsurpassed for something filmed in the 1950s.A must have for musical collectors.
3,THE MOST OVERRATED MUSICAL OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't get me wrong I liked this movie, but what was all the hype about this being MGM's greatest musical ever made???? I can think of many MGM greatest musicals like On the Town, Take me out to the Ball game, Summer Stock, The Wizard of Oz, Kiss Me Kate, ect."
1,"Dull, unfunny, and overrated","Don't bother to try to change my opinion, I just don't like this movie. I didn't think it was funny, or entertaining, or anywhere near being worthy of all the accolades. Why do people mention this movie in the same breath as Hidden Fortress or City Lights? It's obscene and insulting. This is no classic movie. This is just a stage musical in front of a camera. And why is that one dance number near the end so interminably long?Musicals and non-musicals should be kept separate from each other, as documentaries are not put in the same category with fictional or ""depicted non-fiction"" movies. If you want to like musicals, fine, but don't insist that *I* have to like them in order to ""appreciate film."""
1,Dumb,I ordered this DVD and when I tried to play it the DVD player said region error and would not play the movie.
3,60 years is too old,"Quality of the CD is just fine but even though memories of this movie are vivid, time has moved on and so have we. If you are used to watching really old pieces, you may not feel the same."
1,I hate it,"My girlfriend claimed that this was her favorite movie (when she was 2 I guess) so I got it for her and after watching it Im glad for two things:1) I live in 2008 and they make movies with plots that are thicker than that of a red movie.2) I have now seen 1 musical so you cant say,"" well you have never seen one"" when I say I hate musicals."
1,Don't Believe The Hype!!!!,"This must be the biggest conspiracy of all time. Sorry folks, but this is the biggest BORE-FEST I have ever seen. The plot is cheesy and uninteresting. The acting is old-school ham. The Wizard of OZ is the greatest musical, not this sleeping pill."
5,Great entertainment,"I love Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor and the comedy, dancing and singing! I love these type of movies! Wonderful!"
2,Blu- Ray wouldn't play,"It was probably a fluke, but the blu-ray wouldn't play so we returned it! Still love the show and will probably get one to replace it down the road."
5,WOW!!! A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS THIS MOVIE!!!,"This ""Singin' In The Rain"" 60th Anniversary boxed set is fabulous! I love the movie which ALWAYS puts a smile on my face. The commemorative book is terrific and all the extras are great. If you love this film then you will certainly love this boxed set with all the extras. My one year old granddaughter and 5 year old grandson LOVE all the musical numbers. The first time my grandson saw Donald O'Connor doing ""Make Em Laugh"" he couldn't stop laughing and I had to replay it for him over and over again. Well worth the cost. The umbrella is wonderful, excellent quality...now if I could only dance like Gene Kelly!!![ASIN:B007UQRW62 Singin' In The Rain: 60th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]"
5,richard d. barszcz please pull your head out!,"Sorry Richard, but SINGIN' IN THE RAIN was released in May of 1952, in optical mono sound. SITR was never released in stereo to the theaters....always mono. Now, later Gene Kelly musicals like Brigadoon an Les Girls were issued in 35mm 4-track mag, but SITR was too early.Anyhow, The new DVD will knock your socks off!"
3,No No No!! Wait for the Special Edition!,"The movie gets a five, but the package gets a zero in this cheap-o DVD edition. We know there are out-takes (an entire number by Reynolds) and we know there are other materials out there (you can find them on the anniversary VHS edition) but some chintsy exec at MGM gave us zip zero nada on this DVD version!Yes, this IS the greatest movie musical of all time, bar none. It deserves top drawer treatment, and not the kind of packaging usually reserved for bargain B movies. Shame on MGM. Shame shame shame!Do not settle for this bottom-of-the-line package. Hold out for a special edition of this American gem!UPDATE (9.09) Better and more complete editions have come out since I wrote the review for this edition, but at amazon, of course, every review of every edition keeps following the title around. Just use a little caveat emptor and make sure the edition you're looking at is all that it should be."
4,A pity the DVD doesn't have the EXTRAS that are available!,"I have the ""40th Anniversary edition"" video tape of this great movie, released in 1992 (in Australia at least), which features (along with the theatrical trailer), a deleted sequence of Debbie Reynolds singing ""You Are My Lucky Star"" and reminiscences from writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green (which are wonderful!). The lack of these is the only reason I'm taking a star off my rating for the DVD. The film is suberb (and sounds and looks great on DVD)"
5,PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW!,THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN WIDESCREEN AND NEVER WILL BE. YOUR SEEING IT THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN. I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN WIDESCREEN!
4,"Love the movie, but no widescreen!?!","I love this movie and bought it for that reason, but I was disappointed to find that one side of the disc is blank, and there is no widescreen version on the disc. I guess they're not making DVD's like they used to... 5 stars for the movie, 3 for the DVD so an average of 4 stars."
1,Singin' in the Rain,"The DVD is not of good quality, as it skips/tracks poorly in two or three sections of the movie. As a matter of fact, I plan to return it for a refund or an exchange!!"
4,# 1 musical ! :),"If your a lover of old-time classic musicals, you most likely already own this one, if you dont, you should ! I am not a huge fan of flicks that feature mostly dancing and song . . but this includes so many great laughs along with it . . The movie tells the tale of the making of the first talking movies . . Unfortunately the current leading lady in movies, who LOOKS good on screen, has an awful voice, what can be done to keep up with the latest in movies, and yet keep her image . .. You'll want to get this family movie to find out !"
5,An American Musical Classic,"I remember seeing the clip of Gene Kelly doing ""Singin' in the Rain"" years ago on one of the tribute shows. I never realized, though, that this movie was more than just one great song. There are several incredibly athletic dance numbers in this movie all accompanied by great songs. The chemistry between Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, and Donald O'Connor was just incredible and made the movie that much more entertaining. There is great comic relief from not only Donald O'Connor, but Jean Hagen as well.This is one movie that will perk you up if you are down, or just want to have some good, wholesome entertainment.The only ""Potential"" negative I have about this movie is its presentation. I don't know what the theatre screen dimensions were back in the 50's, but this DVD is full screen. It is a great loss for us if parts of the scenes were truncated because the producers chose not to do a letterbox version. It is still a great movie to see, though."
5,"That's no break, it's an edit in the original version",Still one of the best musicals ever made on film. The break in the dance was always there. At one time the rumor was that it was an edit demanded by the censors. But recently co-director Stanley Donen said that it wasn't any such thing.
5,A monument to Gene Kelly and the great Arthur Freed unit at MGM,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the all time great films.It stands as a monument to the talents of producer Arthur Freed, the MGM musical unit he ran, and above all the great Gene Kelly.Period songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown are brilliantly interwoven into a story of the coming of sound to Hollywood.The Studio system had its faults but it also allowed films such as this to be made - and we should all be grateful for that."
5,Wonderfull everything,It has been a long time since I have seen this movie and it really impressed me. I had forgotten how great Donald Oconner was
5,FANTABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie has it all! You will find yourself singing along,and tapping your feet through out the entire film.Not to mention a smile will be on your face from start to finish.This is one Hollywood Masterpiece where ALL the actors are perfect for the roles they play. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are absolutely flawless,not only in their dancing and acting, but in their comicdeliverence as well.As for Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen,how could we even imagine any other actresses playing their roles?The plot of the story is simple,yet keeps your attention from start to finish. Too bad musicals like this are a thing of the past.The quality of this film(sound,color,clearness etc.) is superb. You will definitely find yourself pushing""PLAY"" again once this film is over.Don't be alarmed if after seeing this musical,you find yourself humming ""What A Glorious Feeling"" for days on end.Everyone needs this movie in their collection!!!"
5,Singin in the Rain,Great product great service One of the best musicals ever-a real masterpiece of dancing and singing throughout the filmWonderful
3,"Great gift, but torn umbrella","I bought the 60th Anniversary Blue-Ray box set as a gift for a SITR fan, and everything was perfect except the umbrella, which was defective. The umbrella had a large rip and looked used even though the rest of the box set was brand new (unopened, still in the original plastic packaging). Although the umbrella is not really meant for actual use (it looks more like a collector's item and probably wouldn't stand a chance against the wind), it was still disappointing since the tear was extremely noticeable.The set includes a blue-ray disc of SITR, 2 DVDs of extras, a nice little book with photos and info about the actors in the movie, and an envelope with three little mini-panel strips that combine to make a miniature theatrical poster.The box set would have been perfect if the umbrella weren't damaged. :/Singin' In The Rain: 60th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"
5,There is more to this movie that just one great song!,This movie was never high on my list to see since I had seen the title song scene many times. But there is a lot more to this movie. It is a great lighthearted musical.
5,"A great ""pick-me-up"" movie!","It really isn't possible to either fault at all, nor praise enough the merits of this wonderful film. An absolute classic and a must see, so much so that people who have not seen it are being pickeled, preserved and studied as rare species!"
2,Could've Been,"This movie is an absolute delight to see. The cast is tight and the music thoroughly enjoyable. It is especially fresh given today's films with dark sarcasm and anti-heros. What truely boggles the mind is the full-screen release! Was this movie originally released in a 4:3 format? I think probably not. And to see the effort that was put into restoring the soundtrack yet none was spent, seemingly, on trying to find a suitable original in the theatrical format. In this day of HDTV monitors and widescreen signals, this is unforgivable. I sincerely hope that this situation will be addressed in the future"
3,One great dance number stands out,"I have to start off by agreeing with John Grabowski, who reviewed this movie only two days ago. Singing In The Rain is a three star movie, not anywhere near being one of the greatest movies of all time, and for those of you who call it the greatest, I have to wonder why you are saying that. This is a good movie with strong music and dance performances but be real, it is what it is, period, a three star movie.The one ""five star"" thing about it is the famous dance number by Gene Kelly to the title song. Kelly is so happy, so graceful, it's a pleasure to watch. Perhaps that is all that the other reviewers are thinking about when they give the entire movie five stars. But the rest of the movie is a bit dopy."
5,AWSOME!,MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SO HAPPY TO FINALLY SEE THIS DVD AS IF WE WERE IN THE STUDIO! CLARITY-SOUND COULD NOT BE ANY BETTER! MADE OUR EVENING PERFECT!!
5,A True Classic Movie,"If you as movie buffs if they could name the top ten movies of all time, most lists would include ""Singin' in the Rain."" This movie is what they meant when some guy first wrote the word ""classic."" Among all of MGM's musicals they made during their golden age, this one stands out. It's a comedy, a romance, a musical, everything! It's what you come to the movies for. But people who love the movie already know what I'm talking about, right? This DVD is also a great collector's item. In it is tons of footage. It has the original cast recordings, excerts from the movies that the songs originally came, a doctumentary on MGM, and more. All and all, this is a great purchase whether you've seen the movie or not. Highly recommended!"
5,"I am writing a review on ""Singin' in the Rain""","I enjoyed the movie ""Singin' in the Rain "" very much, The scenes, the music, and esspecially the choreography were delightful to watch. Donnald O' Connor does a fabulous job of dancing his way into the spot light. Gene Kelly does a wonderful job of being yet again the man who gets the woman. If you haven't seen the movie yet you ought to it is a great film. My family and I enjoy watching it as often as possible"
5,Singin' in the Rain is a wonderful blast of Color!,"A Wonderful Blast of Color from everyone in it. Gene Kelly is marvelous a silent-film actor who, with the help of his friends (Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds), makes his silent-film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a morden musical, The Dancing Cavalier. The only problam is his co-star, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). She can't act, sing, or dance, so they get Kathy Selden to dub her voice. But when Lina finds out, she;s furious and want's to ""Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue"". The Crazy Events lead to a wonderful ending. Others in the cast are Cyd Charisse, Millard Mitchell, Rita Moreno, and Douglas Fowley. The soundtrack is wonderful too. It includes ""Good Mornin'"", ""My Lucky Star"", ""Moses"", ""The Broadway Ballet"", and of course, ""Singin' in the Rain""."
5,no widescreen because was filmed in full frame,"This is the greatest musical ever made, making fun of the very industry these people work in. It's wonderful! For those of you disappointed that there is no widescreen, Singin' in the Rain was not filmed in widescreen. Cinemascope and other widescreen processes were not used all the time until the middle fifties, so this film is meant to be and remains in full frame. Sorry to those expecting more, but it was filmed in and remains in 1.33:1 ratio and is still as beautiful as ever."
4,Singin' in the Rain,I got this for my boyfriend as an anniversary gift because he needed more musicals in his collection. Bought it without a hitch. Love this movie so much!
5,Hooray for Hollywood!,"Singin' in the Rain has been my favorite movie since I first saw Gene Kelly do his fancy footwork when I was five. I bought it a couple of years ago on video and have been waiting for a Special Edition DVD to be released. The picture and sound quality are by far the best version that I've seen the movie presented. But what puts the DVD over the top is the extras on both discs. I love the documentaries and it's fun to watch the movie with the ""Reel"" extras. From someone who loves this movie, this was definitely a loving treatment!"
2,Singing in the Rain,I didn't realize I couldn't play Blu-ray DVD's on my player. Unfortunately I had already opened the package so it couldn't be returned.
3,It's not that bad but definitely no big deal,"I am interested in musicals and have seen many. This is mediocre, and pretty silly or even annoying much of the time. The only number of artistic merit is the one referred to in the title, and even that is no match for Astaire's lovely numbers. The dialogue is very simple, and everyone is hamming it up."
1,What! No widescreen! What a rip-off!,"Beware of this DVD: there are NO trailers, NO director's commentary, NO widescreen, NO behind the scenes footage AND NO other extra's whatsoever! Shouldn't you think the best film of all times would deserve better than that on DVD? Makers, be ashamed of yourselves."
2,WATERLOGGED,"Better to watch harvester ants harvesting to the music of Luigi Boccherini for 103 minutes than this musically derivative drivel. It was unceremoniously/critically reviewed upon its initial release. Were we more literate in the 1950's?Only two of the dozen or so tunes are original to this film. 'Singin' in the Rain' dates to 1929.AFI, in their infinite sagacity, does it again."
1,Broken!,"I love this movie! I would give it 5 stars, however, this particular product was broken when I purchased it.Wait, let me clarify, not broken, but had NOTHING recorded on the first DVD. Completely blank! How am I to watch the movie?Warning! Check your DVD immediately upon receipt and make sure they actually recorded something on it. Amazon does not accept returns after 30 days!"
4,Singin in the Rain,Singin in the Rain is a real classic!You find yourself humming tunes fromthe movie for days after watching it.The movie is enjoyable and has noviolence or profanity.
5,classic fun,"Singing in the Rain is the greatest movie of all time. It shows that a film doesn't need to be rolling on the floor hilarious, or hugely dramatic to be great; it just is great. It is a film filled with fun. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are great. They show so much talent, and the dancing is fabulous. Donold O'Conner is so funny. He is the best part of the film, with his comedy combined with his talent for dancing. As well, the classic Singingin the Rain scene is terrific.The DVD includes great extras and great documentaries. It is a must have."
5,Gene Kelly's finest movie!,"I really don't know what to say about this film that hasn't already been said ad nauseum, so I'll keep this review short and sweet. If you are a fan of good movies, and especially a fan of musicals, then you absolutely must buy this film right now! In fact, why are you still reading this? Go put this in your shopping cart immediately! You won't be disappointed."
5,Great DVD!,"This DVD has great sound and picture. The only thing is, make sure you but it in the Amaray Case. The snapper has the 1st edition. The amaray has the 2nd edition with the Alternate Music-Only track with many songs in original stereo. (It says it is available on the snapper case but the disc will not allow it)"
3,Great Film - Lousy DVD,"Classic film. No one can dispute that. So why are there virually no extras on a DVD of the greatest movie musical ever made? Why are there no bios on anyone associated with the film? Why does the color for the first half of the film look like faded Technicolor? Why did the studio not choose to take the time or spend the money needed to digitally restore the film that was spent on Sound of Music or My Fair Lady? OK. It would cost more, but fans of this movie would be willing to pay for it, and all the other wonderful MGM movies musical of the 50s....Give us the extras - let us know the story of the movie, produce a feature length documentary, give us the re-mixed isolated soundtrack, do something besides this. Correct the color, and remix the ST in DTS. Package in in a two DVD set and charge me 30 bucks. I'd buy it. But the current release version is a real disappointment. The singin', dancin', and actin' in this film deserve better."
5,Loved Singin in the Rain.....total classic and a must have..,"Wow, Singing in the Rain is my all time favorite song and movie. But seeing it in blu-ray what can I say but ""Totally Awesome"".. I must have seen it over 10 times and still can't get enough of how beautifully done in blu ray, especially the colors. The music itself is something in itself. This is when singing was singing and meant something. Storyline is still true in 2012 without all the bad words or nudity. It's just a great movie to see with anyone, or even on a rainy day or night.....Just sit back and relax...in the comfy of your couch or bed :)"
5,The best home video version so far.,"Singin' in the Rain is a collector's item, obligatory for film fans and movie buffs. The DVD release, based on the Ultra Resolution transfer method was quite good, but easily surpassed by this new transfer. I was even more impressed with the way sound was processed, much more detailed and defined than before. Highly recommended!"
5,Great movie,"If you enjoyed ""The Artist"", you should see this. Not the same genre, but the same story told in a different way. I love this movie."
5,Singing in the Rain,"If you can't afford too many videos, make this one a priority. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are at their best. The music is wonderful, the acting sensational, and the story of how movies are changed foreverwhen ""talkies"" become available and how the studios try to keep up and how actors' lives are changed forever make a compelling story. O'Connor's Make 'Em Laugh in which he almost kills himself and Gene Kelly's leading lady who gives the dumb blonde phrase a whole new meaning make this a very funny and very lively musical. If you like musicals you'll absolutely love this. Sj"
4,Still Singin',"Who am I to presume to review one of the all time greats? I'm giving it just four stars solely on the basis of its being a little dated. It's been twenty years since I last saw this marvel. Three things struck me that I'd not noticed earlier. (1) How really small Debbie Reynolds's role is (2) Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" is actually a brilliant introduction to break dancing; and (3) Gene Kelly's amazing knee flexibility. Watch him in one of his Kelly-O'Connor duets. He has a singular attribute there seen nowhere else."
5,A true classic!,"My 11 year old daughter, who is a musical theater lover, and I watched this musical together and just adored it. While I had watched it years ago, to see an old, classic show through the eyes of someone who is discovering theater classics, was phenomenal. It's amazing to see how well this help up over time and Gene Kelly, Donald O'Conner, etc. show the same enviable performances that viewers of all ages can truly appreciate!"
5,An eye-popping good time!,"If you love musicals of any sort, buy this DVD! The 50's colors come alive in the DVD transfer. You'll find it hard to believe a ""classic"" movie can look this good on your TV. And the movie itself is so much fun; so much more than the justifiably famous ""Singin' in the Rain"" Gene Kelly number. A great movie for kids and anyone who wants to have a good time. END"
4,focus formula,"Although it didn't drastically change my 4 1/2 year old sons behavior, it definitly took the ""edge"" off. I stopped giving it for 3 days, after 3 weeks on it, and noticed a difference as well as family and friends. Im also pairing this with ""Nordic Naturals Children's DHA"" a cod-liver oil suppl. that is known to balance behavior. I would definitly recommend this to a parent with a child who displays some signs of hyperactivity or who is somewhat oppositional."
4,takes time,"My 6 year old son takes both BrightSpark and Focus Formula. It does work, but it takes time to work. Herbal remedies take time to get into the system and can sometimes take up to 6-8 weeks to see a full effect. Prescription meds are effective in about 3-5 days. You need to be patient while waiting for the full effects of this product, but it is worth the wait and so much better than the prescription meds that can have horrible side effects."
1,Its a sugar pill doesnt work read ingredents,This is a pill with no benefits- Read the ingredients and then google them its a placebo should be illegal to sell junk....
5,I've waited years for this...,"I first became addidted to Fist of the North star when Encore presented the series, two episodes at a time, each Saturday night. There's something special about seeing Ken beat up the bad guys, and with a sense of humor too.This boxset is the second series and it is worth getting. I do wish they would have allowed us to select the different music soundtracks. but, thats not a complaint, just a suggestion.Go watch the first series and then come back for this."
1,"Love this movie! too bad,,,,,,",The quality of this movie was atrocious! I don't know how Amazon thinks they can get away with this. This so-called HD version That cost an extra two dollars Is a pathetic excuse. I rented this to watch with my daughter. The movie was so blurry and distorted I didn't know what we were even watching. Shame on you Amazon never again And of course there's nowhere to state your opinion to Amazon. What a joke
1,Disc out of case and widescreen format didn't work,When we received the disc..it was not in it's secure packaging slot in the container box and had scratches on it. The widescreen format did not work correctly either. It was a small box framed version....Although we have purchased many items thru amazon..this one was a dud! We returned it and the return was incredible. We really appreciate your help on the return.Gideon Linares
5,Classic film in HD!,"The Crow is one of my favorite movies and one that holds a dear place in my heart. I was impressed with the quality of the high definition bluray, as it wasn't filmed of a high quality to begin with. Not a lot of extras, but I didn't expect there to be. A must-have for any Crow fan!"
5,Excelent,"Good HD recap of this great movie. The extras was good, but I excpected to see something about Brondon Lee's death."
2,Another bad HD transfer,"I like Alex Proyas-the director- very much and this one is one of my favorite movie.I already had a DVD and when this Bluray came out, I decided to replace.The result is a a disaster.The image is not better then the DVD. Maybe even worse.The sound is 5.1 HD but couldn't feel any difference. The base sound was so so. The channel was not divided well.I really wish to have my money back."
4,Great seller,This seller was very professional and worked quickly to resolve an issue I had. I would definitely purchase from them again.
1,Not Recommended,"Don't use it off the battery - mine lasted less than 30 charge discharge cycles. Tech supprot guy claimed to have designed every part of laptop, then didn't understand Lithuium ION Batteries.External Monitor output is terrible - screen flickers & jitters with all 6 external monitors I have tried.Mousepad doesn't work properly with Firefox (does anyone use anything else)Flimsy - DVD stopped working - had to twist the base to get it to make contact again.USB power output too low to run external USB drives.If you buy it, you'll probably regret it"
1,Don't Do it!,"Don't buy this computer! Stay away! I got this computer as a Christmas Gift and I LOVED it. It was slick, fast, nice looking and totally portable at 4 lbs. It worked great for TWO WEEKS. It flashed me the blue screen of death in the middle of typing an email and then shut down. On restart as windows was loading it flashed the death screen again and officially died - nothing could be done to revive it. Luckily I was still within the CHristmas return policy and the store swapped it for another one in the store..........that didn't charge because of a bad power cord (broken right out of the box). Their customer service is NOT HELPFUL. I am sure it works well, if you can find a model that works but after two failed attempts, I switched for a HP Pavilion Notebook PC (DV1420US) and hope that one works out. I haven't gotten it out of the box yet."
4,Good sequel,"Again, Salvadore shows his skill with another great novel part of the Icewind Dale trilogy. I recommend you read the Crystal Shard before you start this book."
4,All in all an good fantasy trilogy.,"I agree that he seems to stem off of Tolkien. However, we have to remember that Tolkien actualy invented the world all of this comes from. Salvatore has taken this and spiced it up somewhat a lot. While Tolkien will always be my favorite fantasy author Salvatore rates on up there."
5,The greatest author of Fantasy novels ever!,I grew up playing Advanced Dungeon's and Dragon's. R.A. Salvatore and his Trilogy's are the greatest books I have ever read. I would recomend these books to anyone! The character's in these stories will have a place in my heart for the rest of my life.
5,A better fantasy novel you'll be hard-pressed to find,"Streams of Silver, to me, was a very compelling and intricately-woven tale of daring heroes, wicked villians, and the triuph of good over evil that follows the standard, even raises it, for the genre. I was impressed, to say the least, with the character developments. And the plot, which held you in its thralls to the last page, left one anticipating the return of these old friends once again. And for those that would criticize this book as trite, sophomoric, or only appropriate for teenage boys, I question one's appreciation for the hours of work put into a work such as this, and I'd like to see such a dour reader to better himself. Many authors try, but fall miserably short of R.A. Salvatore's true mastery of the fantasy world. Cheers, Salvatore, on another grand masterpiece, beautifully and eloquently delivered."
3,a mediocre copy of Tolkien,"R.A. Salvatore mentions that he first got into fantasy after reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and the parallels between Salvatore's Mithril Hall and Tolkien's Moria are blatantly obvious. To his credit, Salvatore doesn't go whole hog and try to copy Tolkien's style, adding a different cast of characters with the likes of Drizzt, Regis, Artemis Entreri, etc. But the likes of Bruenor Battlehammer (and his ridiculous mug of ale standard) are a such a poor substitute for the dark, awesome majesty of Tolkien's world, it's almost blasphemous. Still, Salvatore's work is a good book for a lazy summer afternoon."
2,Have any of you guys ever read Tolkein?,"First of all, I am a big fan of R. A. Salvatore's more original works, and although I thought this book was entertaining, every element of it was plagarized from Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, with the Lonely Mountain and the Mines of Moria combined to make Mithril Hall. Even the scence in which Bruenor descends into the abyss with Shimmergloom, and his subsequent escape, were just take-offs from Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. With an imagination that virtually created the Underdark, I don't see why Salvatore had such a hard time coming up with something more original."
5,Rich in romance and history,"I love many of the actors and actresses who starred in this movie and was not disappointed in their roles or performance. This movie is rich in romance and history. I also thought the friction between Richardson's character and her in-laws, as well as tones of prejudice was very well-played. Sometimes I see movies with this sort of theme and it's overdone. I highly recommend seeing this movie at least once.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,It just never makes an impact,"I am quite a fan of Merchant/Ivory films, and I love Kazuo Ishiguro's novels. The cast is also made of wonderful actors. So why is this movie just OK? They recreate 1930s Shanghai with a sort of ""Cabaret"" theme (you can't hide yourself in a nightclub while WWII is clearly beginning outside), which sounds promising, but the whole film feels flat and emotionless. The script has much too much exposition. The Countess part is severely underwritten, which is unfortunate as she is supposed to be the center of the movie. There is no chemistry between the two leads at all. The more interesting relationship is between Jackson and his mysterious Japanese friend. It is also very annoying that Jackson's blindness is overly used as a metaphor. This 2 star rating is in context--it is a 2 star Merchant/Ivory film, but of course with all the awful movies out there this at least a 3 star film among all films."
2,alright film nothing special,"this film takes place in the 30's and is suppose to be dreamlike on so many levels. the performances in this film are good but predictable and nothing ever jumps off. i expected the film to find a centeral to tie all the elements together as one,but it was long on style and short on substance. the directing and overall pacing of the film is nice,but the storyline and the actual purpose of the film gets burried by the gloss of the film. the acting is solid but that is the best thing i can say about it."
3,The White Countess,"Enjoyable but flawed story. I gave it 3 stars because it dragged and was uninteresting in spots, but for the most part it was very enjoyable."
4,Charming tale set in hard times,"Set in Shanghai, this movie follows the life of a White Russian countess, a refugee from the Russian Civil War made stateless by the Reds and forced to support what's left of her family as a taxi dancer. She meets an American with an odd dream of opening his ""dream bar"" with her as the centerpiece.The costumes and scenary are awesome in this film and the acting is very good as well. However, for me the movie never really ""clicked"" from good to exceptional. I enjoyed it but not enough to watch it time after time.The best romance I've seen done in a long time, though."
3,"A portrayal, but not a story","As one reviewer has put it, this film is more of a ""situation"" than a story. It aims to portray the hardships of life in 1930s Shanghai for members of an exiled royal Russian family thrown into poverty, and the lengths one of the princesses, a beautiful woman, goes to keep them fiscally afloat. She unexpectedly finds a caring tenderness in the owner of a socialite club (Ralph Fiennes), but the story of their relationship doesn't move much beyond this, because by the time their feelings for each other bloom, the film is almost over. It does end sweetly, with them both escaping the Japanese invasion of Shanghai with the Countess's daughter, but the satisfaction this ending could have produced was lacking; although the initial setting for this film was very interesting, the story itself did not have the complexity to make it captivating, so a satisfying conclusion could not be earned. This film is very well-acted and provides an interesting window into a lost time."
2,Why no falling down?,"I was surprised that Ralph never fell down or tripped in this film. You'd think a blind guy would go falling down a lot, banging into furniture and walking out into traffic. Apparently Ralph didn't research his character enough or there would have been a lot more physical comedy in his role. Natasha Richardson has really screwed up her face with plastic surgery, too. I give this film 2 stars...one for Ralph not tripping and one for that bad face lift Nat is sporting."
1,A wasted two hours.,"The background is mellow, beautiful, sophisticated . . a typical Merchant-Ivory presenatation. But there was no story. It was a pleasure watching Nastasha Richardson, but the rest of the characters were very difficult to look at. The brooding Mr. Jackson, the obnoxious leeches of a family of hers . . . there was no one here to feel for except for the Countess and her daughter . . practically everyone else was two-dimensional, and there was nothing there. A wasted two hours."
1,BORING,This was the longest most boring movie I have watched in a long time and I waited 5 years to see it! If you want Natasha Richardson watch The Parent Trap.
3,You wanna like it but just cant.,It's a film with big names but on the other hand it's boring as hell and not half as hot.I wont recommend it it's simply too boring and the story although well intend is just plain and dull.
3,Not so good for novice,"Probably the book is good for the experienced, but not so good for beginners like me. Although it addresses the questions like ""what BSC is"", I failed to get a clear picture of the art, and I'm waiting for some other books on the topic from Amazon.Anyway, ""essentials"" are not introduction. To the title of this book, it's especially true."
3,Too Low-key,"I know that reviews and associated opinions are very much a personal thing , but I found this effort a bit too low-key .There really wasn't enough variety in terms of dynamics and tempos , and it all sonded like one large track with a few gaps here and there .I have solo works by all of the artists involved in this , but this just didn't ""click"" for me ."
4,"Complete nonsense, and yet entertaining","I'm not usually into reading things that are just plain unbelievably silly, but not only did I read the book from beginning to end, then watch the movie, I even read the rest of the books in the series. I was amazed at how the randomness of the book just flowed together and not once did I ever read it and say, why is that even relevant or why did Adams write this? I just laughed my buns off. I probably won't ever read it again, but if you love things like Austin Powers, although less crude, this is a very humorous adventure and the characters are easy to fall in love with."
5,Oregon 18 inch chainsaw chain,Great price on chain compared to retail and other outlets and great service by shipper. Will not hesitate to reorder when I need new equipment.
1,GETS DULL FAST,"The chain got dull quick, my Total brand chain ran circles around this chain, I will buy the chain i had used before this one, Total semi chisel"
4,Get what you see,Its exactly as you see it. My son has had this for two years now and the antlers are still standing. That should be enough to push anyone into buying this if they were sitting on the fence about it. So far it has held up really good. It still looks new after two years and he plays with it quite often and sometimes sleeps with it.
5,Real looking,"Love this plush toy. The coloring is a little different in real life (but nothing to really complain about). It definitely looks ""real"" instead of cartoon like."
4,"Cute, but..","Very cute, but I must say it is not very soft. I bought this for my eight year old ,so I believe it will be perfect for him. I might go for something more durable for anyone younger, though!"
4,Awesome Gift,"I got this for my wife, since she loves Deers. I think the toy is awesome so far (mainly stays as a show piece). I did notice the legs seem very cardboard like. If this is intended for a kid who is rough with toys, I would look into something more durable."
