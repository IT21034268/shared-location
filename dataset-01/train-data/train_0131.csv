5,Excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn Reiki,"I own all of Steve's Reiki books and Reiki Attunement DVDs and have found the attunements to be powerful and effective and the companion books (Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Vol. 1-4) to be comprehensive and well written. I commend him for making a powerful healing tool available to so many people."
4,Reiki the Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbals & Attunement plus Reiki Secrets,Very complete and informative. It takes the secrets of Reiki and makes them available to all.
5,Get this book!,"Steve Murray's commitment to making Reiki training easily available to everyone is a blessing! I have copies of several of his books, including this one, as well as the Reiki Master Attunement DVD. Having experience as a Level 2 Reiki practitioner prior to obtaining Steve's material, I was amazed to find much of what I struggled with and wondered about, explained in his easy to understand books with great photos! I already had other Reiki books, but Steve's are much more helpful. Don't let any critics tell you that Steve can't teach Reiki through books and DVDs. Energy has no limits. Upon completing my Reiki Master Attunement with his DVD, my abilities to use Reiki for healing, channeling and psychic connections were greatly enhanced within just a few days. Steve's books are great- down to earth and easy to understand. If you want to learn about Reiki, start with Steve Murray!"
5,Reiki: The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunement,"After reading the existing reviews of this book it is hard to say much more to enhance or expand on them. Steve Murray's book and videos answered questions for me that had gone unanswered for a long time. As a Teaching Reiki Master, I have a huge library of Reiki literature and have read many books. This one book was the best I have found in my 30 years of work on my path to the light. I will use it as a teaching resource with my students and encourage them to purchase it as a guide. The attunement videos are exquisite! In my viewing of them I experienced energy and colors like none I have felt before. This had a dynamic effect on my faith in the work Steve is doing and in his methods for sharing Reiki with the universe. Kudos to Steve Murray. Keep up the good work and we Reiki Practioners will continue to support his efforts and the efforts of all who want to send Reiki out to the universe."
5,Beautiful Figurine,This is an absolute beautiful figurine of St. Francis and all the little animals.The coloring and craftmanship is first rate. Item arrived quickly and is reasonably priced.Great gift for all animal lovers like me!
5,beautiful piece,My Mom collects these and the St. Francis was a beautiful addition to her collection. The shipping was prompt and the product is what I expected.
5,surprising little gem,"I don't know how this book ended up on my reading list, but there it was and the text was short, so I thought I'd take the plunge. And I'm glad I did. Besides being an engaging character study (the entire time you are reading this you are wondering whether this guy was truly a revolutionary or someone who is merely manufacturing his past), the ending was simply ... well ... magnificently executed. Read it."
5,"A wonderful, concise dictionary!","This dictionary was a very nice find. It is not too poetic or dry and is a great complement with other more ""in-depth"" dictionaries. The definitions are more than adequate and has a no-nonsense feel to it so we can get right down to business. And how can you lose out with the price? A great dictionary. Laurence Urdang is a genius!"
2,There's a reason why this book is out of print,"A majority of the important action is related in flashback style or one character telling another what happened. Rather annoying. Olivia is so caught up in her own troubles, she basically is ignorant of what's going on in her childrens' lives, which turns me against her character. Amos is just there. He doesn't play much of a part in the book. This is Maya's story, and she's not much of a heroine to root for. Plot twists were obvious and seen coming a mile away. I'll give credit, though, to Ryman having the guts to kill a major character."
2,Disapointing sequel,"After the grand passion and depth to the characterisation in ""Olivia and Jai"" the tale of the next generation seems dull. The plot moved slower,and it was difficult to care very much about such milch-toast characters. It was a terrible disapointment to see Olivia reduced to a soppy dishrag regreting the past and wringing her hands. Where did all her grit go? Rebecca, you can do better!"
3,10 Motor Massage Cushion,"This product has some nice features: 10 massaging motors, heat which can be operated independently if you choose, and you can use it either in the home or the car. However, if you use it in your home and will be sitting in it a lot, it is not all that comfortable."
5,At his Best!!!,This collection of songs by Dan Fogelberg and Tim Weisburg have a catchy style of sounds from jazzy blues to classical to good old rock and roll. This has to be considered one of Dan's best musical effort that awakens your senses and fills you with Dan's passion for creating emotionally charged songs. Tim Weisburg is one of the finest flautists that covers and supports most of Dan's songs on this CD. Together they make a great duo along with their supporting band members especially the drummer. Check out this CD and listen to it on a good sound system to feel the power that comes to life in each song.
5,A longtime favorite,I loved this album as a teenager and wanted a copy. Great music. Couldn't find it on iTunes so I purchased the hardcopy.
5,Great listening music,The songs on this album are timeless and classic and great for background music. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
4,"good concept album, ending with a surprise","there're several tunes (tracks) deployed for radio station programswhen I start listening this CD, several tracks are pretty familiar, and this album recalls me another concept album: Skyedance (Fraser and Machlis)I likeSince You've been askedParis NoctuneI read a story about this album, that the last track IS NOT ""The Power of Gold"", it's piano tune, but it made a mistake, and it's too late to remake, and Dan decided to make a quickie, that's why the last track brings us a surpriseit's good concept album, with familiar sounds, and an ending surprise"
4,A Very Good CD,"One of my favorite CDs. Of the 10 tracks, I've rated two of them as Excellent, three as Very Good, four as Good, and one as OK (I use Media Player's five star rating system where two stars (not three stars) rates as OK). My individual track ratings are:1. Twins Theme -- 3 Stars2. Intimidation -- 4 Stars3. Lazy Susan -- 5 Stars4. Guitar Etude No. 3 -- 4 Stars5. Tell Me To My Face -- 3 Stars6. Hurtwood Alley -- 2 Stars7. Lahaina Luna -- 3 Stars8. Paris Nocturne -- 4 Stars9. Since You've Asked -- 5 Stars10. The Power Of Gold -- 3 Stars"
2,Muzak?,"Some of the instrumental pieces on this album would sound natural floating through the speakers of a hotel lift. They are rather pretentiously titled, and not much more than pleasant tunes. Tim Weisberg's flute only adds to that impression. But if you're a fan of the flute, you may disagree. To me, it gives this a very `seventies' feel. Quite fun though, if you're in the mood. Dan does put vocals on a few tracks, most notably the rather overdone and fairly unoriginal `Power of Gold'. Best stuff on the album is when Dan covers songs from the sixties and does a nice job. This album is the more appealing twin of the more recent `No Resemblance Whatsoever'."
5,Excellent!,"Wayne J. Keeley scripted an outstanding book envoling all ... The Three 3's in writing!!! Sex ... Suspense ... Stimulation! The Author is an Attorney and keeps your mind wondering, what can happen next.Fast moving, Simply Superb!It should be made into a Motion Picture!!!Looking forward to the next novel!!!"
3,Legal Mayhem in NYC,"If a furiously paced thriller is for you, give Mahogany Row a try. Author/Attorney Wayne J. Keeley creates an environment of peril in New York City for his lawyer protagonist Mark McCoy. In some ways, this book is more related to The Fugitive than a legal drama, you'll want to keep the pages turning. Throw in a dash of kinky sex, a curious romance and an omnipresent cop and you have the ingredients for a good, seasonal read.I had fun with this book and I think most mystery lovers will, too. For a first novel, not too bad. The plot leaves little time for character development. The characters would be interesting to get to know."
3,"Fast, Furious & Loads of Fun!","Wayne J. Keeley's debut novel, ""Mahogany Row"" is high-octaine fun from start to finish. If you're looking for a quick and highly entertaining suspense novel, you can't go wrong with this lean and gritty read. While the characters seem to lack depth overall, and many of the relationships are sketchy at best, the novel moves at such break-neck speed, you barely have time to notice. If you're looking for deep character studies and thought-provoking prose--you'll be disappointed. But if you're in the mood for some escapist thrills and chills, ""Mahogany Row"" is just the ticket."
2,A home should be a home...not a theme park,"I have to be honest here: I had high hopes for this book.The first problem with Katie Brown's book is that embraces a really [odd], artsy crafty approach....like turning a wok into a light fixture. Just because something can become something else doesn't make it right. It just looks tacky.The projects are strange, the decor is way too thematic (like a theme park..I swear), and it just seem soooo off..."
1,I don't get Katie B.,"This book and KB's show (Katie Brown's Workshop) are just so weird! I don't get how she could've not only made it as a ""designer"" but also managed to get on TV with her own show. What? I have to admit that whenever her show is on pbs, I watch it just to see her outlandish, impractical, and rather ugly craft ideas... such as wrapping men's shirts around vases and tying them w/ ribbon!? Spreading dry coffee grounds into a baking dish full of water, stirring it around, and then dipping the bottom of a glass into it--then using it to ""print"" circles onto craft paper to create a table covering?! First of all, the technique didn't work and looked like a dirty, coffee cup stained piece of paper---so ugly, I'm sorry. There's always something SO bizarre and weird on her show-- which is what compells me to watch it."
1,Melissa in Bakersfield,"I AM A BIG FAN OF KATIE BROWN SO WHEN SHE CAME OUT WITH HER FIRST BOOK, I BOUGHT IT EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT REALLY INTO MOST OF HER ENTERTAINING IDEAS. WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT HER DECORATING BOOK, I WAS EXCITED TO SEE WHAT SHE HAD COME UP WITH. WELL, I WAS COMPLETED DISAPPOINTED BY IT. I PUT THE BOOK BACK ON THE SHELF AND A FEW DAYS LATER, I CHECKED IT OUT JUST TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND MAYBE SEE IF IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD. WELL, NOTHING CHANGED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW COMPLETELY OUTLANDISH THE MAJORITY OD HER IDEAS WERE. I WOULDN'T DECORATE MY GARAGE WITH SOME THOSE IDEAS. CHECK IT OUT FIRST BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY IN FOR SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T AND IT WON'T BE GOOD."
1,katie brown decorates,"not very helpful, at least nothing real people would put in there home. REally, a pinned together slipcover - maybe good for a college dorm room, but not real life."
5,"Very informative, a great instruction manual.","I've had an idea for a magazine for a few years, but haven't done anything about until now. This book was great! Husni gives a different instruction in every other chapter. Chapters in between instructions are for interviews. He interviewed people who have already gone through the launch process. This was both informative and inspiring. I've read ""The Magazine Publishing Industry"", and it wasn't as informative for someone interested in launching a magazine. Husni's nickname is ""Mr. Magazine"",and with this excellent book, I would say he has earned it."
3,Not much here...,"With respect to the other reviews, and to the author, I did not get much out of this book. Some of the stories of those who have started their own magazines were really sophmoric and added little to the body of knowledge needed to tackle such an enormous task.I found Cheryl Woodard's book far more detailed, informative and cautionary."
2,not much help,I was looking for info on step by step diagnostics of sensors. This book didn't help. It looks like a compilation of previously published specs.
4,Good personal account,"It's definitely well written, and it's a very personal account of the author's journey. It's not as dramatic as I thought it'll be but then, I guess that's real life at times. It's definitely as honest as it can be. It does give a good account of what's going on in Burma, especially in the rural parts too. I'll recommend it for those interested in learning about Burma from a Burmese person, and from the native's perspective. Easy to read but by no means a simple writer. It's a literary piece for sure."
3,Smaller than expected...........but O.K.,"Since there is no size mentioned on the details page, I didn't know what to expect. Just the face of the Boo-boo soother is only 6 inches across(This is not including the hands and feet). The heating pad itself is about 4 1/2 inches across and is extremely hard to put back in the pouch if frozen, because the heating pad must be folded to put back in. (I just don't take mine out, unless it's being washed.) All in All, it sure is cute!"
2,Cute but not cool,"This ""boo boo"" soother has an adorable, machine washable terry cloth cover, but the small, round, soft plastic insert that you freeze is not effective. The insert isn't large enough to soothe most boo boos and the coolness dissipates long before the boo boo stops hurting. I would look for something larger."
3,I only bought it for the music of 'The Piano',"I was somewhat disappointed because I was only interseted in the music for the film 'The Piano' by Michael Nyman and took a chance in buying a book with the best of all his music. The music for this film is quite different from his usual style and unless you realy like all Michael Nyman's music, you'd be better off buying another book of him with more music from 'The Piano'."
5,Bird in his Natural Habitat: Live at the Royal Roost,"Hearing Charlie Parker rip searing riffs on this Savoy set, while I imagine being among those lucky few who witnessed Bee Bop's prophet push the envelope at the Royal Roost, has taken me to whole new level of appreciation for the greatest jazz musician of our time. Live Parker recordings far surpass the studio ones because they allow the listener to hear the saxaphonist's pure power and genius. No editing, no muting, no time limit. Just pure, raw, genius. And this is the best live collection I've found of Parker's work. Some may argue that this collection is too raw in terms of sound quality, but I think that merely enhances the mystique and grit and authenticity of this incredible collection. This is a must-have for Ornithologists!"
5,The most inspiring book I have ever read.,"I read this book in the 6th grade and it was very heavy, but it is my favorite book. I did a project on Hanna Senesh and I learned so much about the Holocaust. I would recomend this book to anyone who needs to be inspired. Hanna Senesh was a brave young lady."
4,Almost as good as they get.,"This is an extremely well-written, extremely interesting story. It was broken down, essentially, into four parts, one of which followed an alien force taking control of a Federation mining colony, one of which followed the Enterprise going to the colony's assistance, one of which followed Kirk and the landing party which had to be abandoned in the rush to aid the colony, and one of which followed former Captain Pike and Deena living on Talos IV. I knocked the rating down to four stars only because the entire section dealing with Pike and Deena was neither especially interesting, nor germane to the story (although it WAS still well-written). Otherwise, the book is virtually flawless."
2,Fire and Ice: The Korean War,"This book read like a reference book. There was a dry history of the Korean campaign, followed by chapters on armaments, ranks and insignias, contributing military groups, etc., with lots of statistics. I had been expecting more of a dialog about strategies, rationales for battles, human interest stories, overcoming hardships, etc."
2,Fact oriented with little analysis accountm of Korean War,This book fills its pages with numerous factual items without much regard for what is most important. More of a statistical abstract than an analysis of the key moments in the conflict.
4,The essential guide to the Korean War,Fire & Ice is a most interesting and authoritative account of the Korean conflict. Conveys the full sweep of the war from confrontation.. bitter struggle.. and a fragile peace. It is endlessly fascinating.
3,Disappointing,This is an unimaginative handbook of facts about the Korean War. It is not a history of the war.
2,kinda cheap,"I hate giving bad reviews because I don't want to hurt anyones feelings, but this broke after just 5 minutes after it was mounted on the garage wall. I'm assuming that it's not meant to be screwed to a wall? Anyhow, it was never allowed to be enjoyed. It was cute, though."
1,Not what I thought I was getting!,"I was in a wedding, and had to wear a strapless gown. Being well-endowed, finding a bra/slimmer was tricky. I ordered this one, along with four others, and this was the WORST! It's very thin fabric, so it has very little support in the bust. The piece was not as slimming as the others I tried. The slip rides up when you walk or sit, and the top slides down, without thick fabric or stays. If you are a D-cup or over, I would not recommend wasting your time or money with this one!"
4,Beautiful yet neglected opera,"This recording of one of Ponchielli's ""pre-Gioconda"" operas is truly amazing. Reproduced from a live recording in 1979, the remastering alows for studio sound while retaining the dramatic intensity found mainly in a live performance. Special mention must be made of the prayer in Act I ""Spirito creator su lui discendi"". The soloists in this recording may not be as familiar as Domingo, Marton, etc. However, they bring this unjustly forgotten opera to life in a special way. It is the only other Ponchielli opera to be recorded and is a must for collectors. The only drawback is that there is no libretto or synopsis."
4,Chorus reminencent of Verdi,"Came upon this by accident, and gave a listen.Quite beautiful. Nice choral ensembles, and a marvelous ending which is reminencent of Verdi's BATTAGLIA DI LEGNO.Agree with previous reviewer on lack of libretto or even a synopsis.Found a synopsis on the internet, but when ""translating"" from the Italian it becomes muddled."
3,a really nice try,"Above all, I liked this book because of the architectural lab goal that achieved, essentially it's an urban excercise based (and this is what makes it interesting)on real extrapolated data extracted from diverse cities of Dutchland.It's a game of cause and effect,playing with different urban models that have been applied on different cities around the world and at the same time with the concecuenses of it.I think that is a really good example about how to analize the actual concept of the city based on pure shear data,on an experimental level.What I really missed ,about the book, was a conclusion or some kind of resolutions extracted from the whole excercise more than the sole purpose of doing it,but still, it's an excellent book."
5,A timeless classic,"As the back cover states, this film is like the fish itself - a work of art. Set in a time (early 1970's) and place (Key West) that many consider to be the ""real Florida"" (i.e., Paradise Lost), this film is a funky classic that captures the essence of tarpon fishing on the fly. The cinematography is magnificent and the main characters include three of the top American literary talents of the late twentieth century all of whom share a sense of the quasi-religous experience that is tarpon on the fly. The film closes with a compliation of tarpon aerial displays that is reminisenct of the climax of a high end fireworks show - truly worth the price of admission."
5,amazing book,"One of the best books I've read in a long time. I attribute that to the vivid writing style, incredibly strong characters, and a plot that refuses to give away any secrets before it's ready. The other books in the series are just as good. Recommended."
5,Fantastic Learning Tool,"All algebraic processes widely explained in a step by step reasoning method. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn algebra, or reinforce their knowledge in the subject.One thing for the information of the reviewer on top of the list, and everyone else: Aurelio Baldor is actually a Cuban professor of mathematics, and absolutely not an Indian mathematician. It is advisable to do some research before writing a review."
2,too large,"Much too large! We had to return it. Guardian Angels are to watch over you, not be in your face."
4,Nice gift,This was a nice gift for the grown children for their cars. Inexpensive yet solid clips with a nice loving message.
4,Good printer at a good price,"I own this printer and bought one for my kid's school. It offers everything we need for home use - printing kid's homework assignments, making copies, scanning in pictures. Very reliable, never had any problems with it. Easy to setup. Very happy with it. The only thing that may be improved is the noise level when in idle mode.All in all, very good printer for the money. Highly recommend it."
4,Love this machine!,"This little Samsung copier is awesome! It is fast, quiet, and efficient. What more can you ask? Love it!"
2,Right Back was good,"Their new material on Right Back proved that without nowell they still had some songwriting talent. This album contains some decent reggae songs but they are glossed over and it sounds like pop and the lyrics simply are lacking. They seem really disorganized and they don't really have central songwriters. This album really lacks good instrumentals, they have a sax, a flute and an organ yet you hear so little of them if anything. At least in their previous album they had some more depth. also the rap is bad on this album and so is the punk. as a matter of fact this whole cd is pretty bad. i like the band and i want some good modern reggae to be produced but i guess i will have to look further."
3,In need of a little guidance,"Radio these days seems lost in a whirl of carbon copy idiots with about as much pop culture shelf life as slap bracelets. But for those looking to extend their Sublime collection beyond the sad end to LBDA, who flashing a similar sound takes it a step forward. This album is a little more relaxed than the first, stepping timidly into dancehall and trip hop beats. For those seeking the kind of reggae/rock/ska combo that I am starving for, you might enjoy Sunny Days, It aint easy, and Rolled Up. They carry the kind of catchy-ness that your local carbon plant radio is unable to produce. The rest of the album is a kind of blur, with no real distinct direction in any given song, serving more as great background party music but nothing earth shattering."
4,hoping for more,"When I first found out that the Long Bach dub allstars were coming out with a new album I was exremely excited. I am a big fan of their previous album right back which is one of my favorite cd's. When I bought the new album I was expecting to hear a familiar sound, but I was really suprised by this new album which seems to be really laid back. It seems to me that they are trying to make more radio friendly songs so that they may appeal to the masses. I feel that the sound is different from the first album, but that dosen't mean that it's a bad thing. Some of the songs really get stuck in your head and if your a long beach dub fan I recomend picking it up and if your curious about the cd I still say pick it up because overall it is a great cd."
2,Two stars at best,"The Long Beach Dub Allstars had a fabulous first album, Right Back. That cd had sick reggae and dub right from the heart. Wonders of the World seems contrived to me, and I blame the producer David Leary of the butthole surfers. He produced sublime's self-titled which was as we all agree a great album. However I would guess that Brad Nowell was more at the helm of producing in that session then the Allstars were for Wonders of the World. Wonders of the World has a similar sound to the sublime self-titled album and right back seems separated from it. Basically what I am saying is that Right Back is a great album and follows up for sublime, whereas Wonders of the World is cheap and plastic and I am honestly bummed and disappointed and I don't really know what went wrong with this recording it really [isn't good], buy right back it is really really good."
4,"Sublime's kid brother, give him a chance","I am a huge Sublime fan and have found it to be more of a family. No matter where I am people are always telling me their Sublime stories. Long Beach Dub All Stars is just like Sublime's kid brother. Everyone is always comparing them. Why not give the kid a chance is all I'm saying. These guys are good in their own right, yes their music is different than Sublime's but that doesn't mean anything. I hate being compared to my older brother, don't you?"
4,Great intro. to the language. Great resource for travellers.,"I've yet to find a better book to serve as an introduction to this challenging language. The book is not for serious language students, but it does an excellent job of introducing the basics of language. There are also some informative cultural insights which is found interesting and appropriate. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is considering visiting this marvelous country and its wonderful people. In light of the dearth of quality or current material on the introduction to the Georgian langauge and culture, I find this book to be a pleasant surprise."
3,No mkhedruli font,"Too bad it isn't in mkhedruli, it isn't in Georgian script. It is however the best and only dictionary for less than $30-40. And you will be able to tell someone not to shoot at you or to steer clear of minefields."
2,Don't Move It!,"Works great, great picture, and can definately handle a load, BUT, dont ever move it. The HDMI connector felt cheap for starters-didn't pay that much for it-but in my situation in which the cable had to be removed a few times for other mantainence in my rack and viola the connector comes off and leaves the pins there. Couldn't fix. Wouldn't trust it again or recommend it if you ever have to touch it again after install."
5,im in love with the cd,This cd has so many memories of my mom singing in the car when I was a lil girl. My mom had this on cassette of course at the time
5,"Sexy, sensitive, wonderful","Julie Wilson's tribute to Cole Porter is a brilliant foray into the catalogue of this master songwriter. She and her pianist William Roy explore all sides of Porter, including some fine obscurities as well as many great Porter standards. To each, Julie Wilson imparts her very special brand of wit and feeling, whether on a moodily brilliant interpretation of 'Down In The Depths' or a swinging and sexy romp through 'Don't Look At Me That Way'. All in all, a superb album, displaying Ms Wilson's talents at their apex."
1,Advice? Retire!,"I don't think Cole Porter ever wanted his wonderfully witty lyrics to be read in such an overly dramatic manner. I hadn't listened to a Julie Wilson recording for many years and I purchased this one believing that she would be as enjoyable as she was when first I heard her. Either my tastes have changed, or Julie has.She hams her way through this familiar stuff as if she doesn't know what the lyric is about. It isn't that her voice is bad, it's just to much voice for Cole Porter's music. Her reading of ""Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love"" is an example of the over-acting that is evident in every selection on this CD. Buy some of her old recordings, but...leave this one alone!"
2,Excellent,"Like it. Love it. Live in Paris will always be in my top 5. She is a star with this incredible band. Some of her originals are too melancholy for me, but she is truly unique in her talents. Who else can compose, sing and play jazz piano like that? Who was the girl?"
5,KRALL IS A STAR,"All for You might be an older CD/album but it is so great. Diana Krall has never disappointed, she produces wonder jazz and easy listen works."
5,Diana's Very Best!,"Almost all of Ms. Krall's CDs are fantastic, but this one is utterly stunning. What are you waiting for? Get up there and hit the BUY NOW button before any more of your life is wasted. You NEED this one, baby!"
4,Just what I was looking for!,"A lovely, delicate looking chain that feels strong. With just the right amount of sparkle."
5,Better than I expected,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! Not too fancy but just enough sparkle so it can be worn with casual, but enough sparkle for evening wear."
2,Doesn't hold up,"The first time I used this feeder, it worked flawlessly. Then I had to clean it. Getting the bottom apart was a royal pain, and it has leaked ever since. The ants on the ground are extremely happy, but I am not!On the plus side, the birds loved the perches."
5,Intelligent and meaningful,"This is one book that is in my personal library I will never get rid of. Thoughts while Tending Sheep is one of the most thought inducing books I've ever read. This book really makes you think about life and all the strange things that get us to where we are now. The author overcame many obstacles (Personal and other which he writes about) to become an author. Extremely well written book.The author writes about his life in California raising sheep with his wife Louise. He he also writes about his loyal dog, Maxie, a border collie, who means the world to him. He writes about how the sheep have taught him about life, love, challenges and ultimately God. He also speaks of his faith in Jesus Christ, from the time he was a dyslexic school boy who could barely read or write to the author he has become.This story really will bring you to tears and make you ponder your own life. Excellent book."
2,"2 stars at best, on a good day","Have had this now for about 18 mos and we're at our wits end. Ready to head somewhere else and get new set.Features that are breaking our back:1) Unreliable caller ID- usually ""no data"" or ""incomplete data""2) Backlights come on for no reason, many times per day, can't have this in our bedroom or a glowing blue light will come on many times of night, from the phone3) Wireless internet DOES get disconnected sometimes when the phone rings (so how is this DECT supposed to help us?)This is enough- we've given it a good try and ready to move back to 5.8ghz with maybe Panasonic or AT&T;."
1,save your money,"worst audio i have ever experienced on a cordless phone. i could barely hear the other caller with the volume up to its highest level. when i could hear anything at all, it was so garbled i had no idea what they were saying. the ringer volume is so low if you are not in the same room as the phone, you miss the call. the handset is another problem. because the volume is so low, i was constantly moving the unit to see if i could hear better and wasn't sure if the earpiece was lined up correctly to my ear. the shape of the phone does not make it easy to know if you are holding it in the correct position. this piece of junk is going back to the store tomorrow."
1,It's fine unless you want to hear!,"We've owned, or should I say, suffered with this phone for more than a year. The sound quality is poor, and the volume insufficient. I do not have a hearing impairment, but I constantly have to ask people on the other end to repeat themselves. Even the top range of the volume control leaves me frustrated, trying to interpret a muffled-sounding voice. Disappointing purchase."
2,1980's-Style Memory Feature,"I thought this would be nice phone that had the features I wanted, without a raft of useless ""features"" that would get in my way. That was true--the phone works quite well in almost all respects. It has one serious design flaw however: it can remember up to 50 phone numbers for you, but you have to manually store each of them in a numbered memory location. Want to call ""Jane""? You have to either remember which memory number you stored her phone number in (was it #29? or #16?), or you have to scroll through all the memories in memory number order (NOT alphabetical order). Want to store a new number? First you have to scroll through all the memory locations to find a vacant one to store the new number in.Come on, GE, I haven't seen a phone that worked this way in decades!"
2,Compared several phones - GE's audio very poor,"I wanted a phone with the following features:- didn't interfere with home WiFi network- had a headset jack on the handset- had a mute button- had an answering machine- could keep good quality while roaming 1 or 2 rooms awayI tried two sets of GE 6.0 phones, and both suffered from faint, tinny, clipped audio. Words that were perfectly understandable on other phones were simply not there on this one. Also, the buttons aren't actually lit - the light is a ring around each button, but not the button itself. So it actually makes it HARDER to read individual buttons in a darkened room.I was very disappointed in this phone.Of those I tried: GE, Uniden, Panasonic and AT&T;, the Panasonic was the best. All features work, Panasonic audio is good, and the buttons and beeps are nice and responsive. Only complaint about the Panasonic is that there is no display on the base unit to show how many answering machine messages are waiting."
3,Ghosts in the machine?,"I purchased this phone and it worked as expected except I had hung up the phone on accident when trying to shoulder the phone because the talk button is next to your face and it hangs up. That I could live with. But what I couldn't is that randomly the phones would light up with the blue backlight. I thought the phone was ringing without sound, but it wasn't. This happened on both handsets.Then I have the extra handset by our bed and last night my husband and I noticed that it was blinking erratically behind the speakerphone button! It was very odd and it continued to happen and always does, but you cannot see it with the lights on. So, I'm taking this phone back and just going to use my old 5.8 GHz phone that I really didn't need to replace in the first place."
1,Terrible,I'm returning my phone immediately. The display is almost completely unreadable due to the ridiculous blue on blue color choice and glare of its brightness. Shame on you G.E. for putting out such a terrible product.
2,I should have read the review first...,"I should have read the previous review first. The picture made it seem that the topper came with it. Yes, it smells nice but it's not exactly what I was looking for."
2,Just okay,I just put this rack together today. I like the concept but believe the price is way to much as the rack is not all that sturdy nor do the pegs hold the sides together. I would actually ship it back but I need something ASAP. The positive: the smell of the cedar is nice!
4,Well-written effort is Highway companion,"Tom Petty did it again. Maybe a bit less rocking than some of his efforts, and missing most of the Heartbreakers, Highway Companion remains a album you (and your kids if you have any) will enjoy. My four year old insists on listening to Highway Companion on the way to nursery school and has the lyrics to Saving Grace memorized. My 8 year old has most of the album memorized. Great CD, highly recommended!"
1,Sucked!,"I thought we would like this...it sucked. WE are in our late 40's, gave it to my son in his mid 20's...he likes it. Go figure! It's just a bit too new sound for us. We thought it would be good old Tom Petty sound. It wasn't."
2,Big Dissapointment!,"I could be wordy but let's just cut to the chase. This album ""suck's. I am a big Tom Petty fan & egarly awaited the release of this album but wow what a dissapointment.I guess Tom Petty is at his best when he is with the Heartbreakers"
4,The Most Consistent In Rock and Roll,"I must say, Tom Petty has to be the most consistent in rock and roll for releasing excellent music. Highway Companion is just one more example of outstanding rock and roll. While this one is certainly no Damn the Torpedos or Full Moon Fever, every track is solid. It took me a few listens before I really began to appreciate it fully. The best songs are probably Saving Grace, Down South, and Ankle Deep, and there is not a weak one in the bunch - no filler here. Buy this and put it in your car CD player, and it will inevitably be your new Highway Companion!"
2,Highway companion - Not quite the saving grace,"i have seen people raving about how good and blah blah this record is. Well what shall i say, i fell for it and ordered it online. Now!!! being a tom petty fan i took the trouble getting it before anybody else here in india, because it takes ages for new albums to get here. Result - Alas! the task at hand was that of trying to finish listening to all the 12 tracks and then chuck it down into the Cellar. I was waiting on track after track expecting something better to come up But was immenseley discontented. Saving grace! seems to be the only grace on the whole album. I feel some of the tracks were improvised straight lifts from his previous heartbreakers ventures. This record is going to Catch dust in the cellar."
5,"Excellent Album, Best of 2006","I have never been a Tom Petty fan in my life but I heard ""Saving Grace"" on Itunes and thought it was an instant classic. I went ahead and bought the entire album and I love it. The best tracks are ""Saving Grace"", ""Big Weekend"", ""Night Driver"", and ""Flirting With Time"". Petty's vocals are not as nasaly as they have been in the past (that's a good thing) and this is just all around a fun, great record. Buy it!"
5,Better late....,"Love Petty, and have most of his albums, but I just missed this one when it surfaced. Bought it for a Thanksgiving road trip. Good move. I have listened to it ever since...no boredom in sight. He really celebrates his influences on this one, and does so with his usual light hand, good heart, and easy relaxed skill. Buy this one, if you don't already have it."
2,Treading water at best,"I listened to this album and I don't understand how people can say this stands with Tom Petty's best work. Same chord progressions, middling to plodding tempos - the whole thing sounds tired and vacnt of any new ideas musically and lyrically. I am a fan of Tom Petty, have seen him live, and was really diappointed in this album. I expected more - maybe a little fire to go with these new insights. No song is really bad nor is any song really good. There's a sameness to each song which causes the whole album to seem boring. I hope this album does not serve as his swan song."
4,Tom Petty's going strong,I loved Last DJ but like this one even better. The songs grow on you the more you listen to them.
3,Where's Melinda?,I'm waiting for the cd to arrive at my doorstep and noticed that Melinda is excluded from the album? That song was arguably one of the best on last years tour. Anyone know why the track has disappeared?
1,a cat that has been coasting for years&ti shows,"Tom Petty has been in the Industry for a really long time&it shows with the way he is able to basically get a free pass with another same song&Album feeling Project. Chord Progressions haven't changed in years, vocally are the same&the Overall Production feels phoned in on a whole. it's been quite a while for me since petty has put out a decent Album let alone a decent Song. this is a Album that is more Highway Cruise control than a Companion."
2,Tom Petty Light,"Big disappointment, as was Last DJ. Still hope he can get past apparent mid-life crisis and get back to level of 80s + 90s work."
2,A major letdown,"After not having bought a CD in a couple of months, I bought three last week, this one, as well as the new releases by Sammy Hagar and George Thorogood. I was looking forward to this CD the most, and it is by far the worst.The main problem is that it is TOO mellow. If you like Tom in that mode, then you'll like this CD. After hearing ""Saving Grace"" prior to the release, despite sounding like he was ripping off ZZ Top, I was really excited. Then I got the CD and listened to it.Nothing's really bad, but nothing's really good on it either.I shouldn't be surprised, because I've really been waiting for the pre-""Echo"" Tom Petty to return, and that may never happen.Again, if you like the mellow Tom Petty, you'll probably like this. But it's nowhere near the quality of ""Full Moon Fever."""
5,Tom Petty Refinement,"This CD will pull you in from the first song, then it takes you through a journey full with life moments in time. I find myself liking a couple of tunes, then loving all of them and want to hear them over and over again. This is another Tom Petty's classic and one that I recommend."
4,highway companion- tom petty,tom petty just keeps on getting better as the years roll by-if you like petty you will like this cd.
4,quite jingle jangle troubadour,"good new album from tom petty without heartbreakers.a taste of honey but lyrics not too optimistic about life on the road and music business. the melodies are sublime, a touch of beatles and two touch of dylan, the better dylan. petty is fine observer and tough rocker, the musicof highway companion is a breeze in a hot summer night, his vision of music world is the reflection of a man that has lived all the good and all the bad of the rock n'roll over his skin. Full of maturity, wise and ironic and relaxing too, with great harmonies and airy guitars, highway companion is the best friend of the summer of 2006.MAURO ZAMBELLINI"
1,Tom has forgotten how to rock,"Sorry, but I'm just not into this phase of Tom Petty's song writing. He hasn't really made a great rock album since Full Moon Fever. The first track, ""Saving Grace"" is classic Petty. The rest of the disc is pretty much a melancholy, introspective album and the last 4 tracks are complete throwaways. I still love TP to death and his live shows are not to be missed. But I just prefer to hear Rock and not this toned down, Dylan imitation. It took me a while before I developed a fondness for ""Wildflowers"". Maybe the same will happen for this disc but I've listened to it 6 or 7 times now and I really don't have a desire for repeat listening. I guess Tom is following in the steps of Clapton. Age mellows a person and maybe Tom is just writing songs that reflect where he's at in life. I miss the Tom Petty I grew up with!!"
5,Highway Companion out standing,i have few of pettys cd and this one is just as good as his othersi was not disappointed at allit rocks
4,Once a Traveling Wilbury...,"This record sounds amazing and after just seeing Tom Petty in concert with Pearl Jam I am a little biased. The album is much mellower than I expected, think ""Face in the Crowd""-like tempos, but I liked the funky 'Jack' and 'Down South.' A great listen."
1,Obnoxious Rip Off!!!!,"Record companies can't figure out why people get music online and don't want to pay money for the CDs? It's because they keep jerking people around with things like this!I paid good money for this album, happy to support the artist. Now I find I've only got part of the album. I don't care about ""leatherette boards."" I want what I paid for in the first place--the music. All of it. How many CDs do they expect people to buy to get a full album?I may wind up with this ""special edition"" and the four missing tracks, but they sure won't be getting money from me for it."
2,Record Companies = Organized Crime,"Record companies mirror the Sopranos more than legitimized business. Doing such a thing with a group such as the Beatles makes a little sense because the band is deceased. ""Buyer beware"" is the phrase that fits regardless of what ""deluxe"" edition you purchase.To me, the original Napster is really Robin Hood......steal from the rich to give to the poor........."
1,No offense to Tom...,"But I will NOT give into this shameless ripoff by the record company. A nice way to treat and reward fans who bought the original CD would be to offer the 4 bonus tracks on an EP for $5 or so. Or offer the songs for download. But when have record companies ever been so thoughtful? I'll just look for these elsewhere, and if I don't get them, oh well. The original CD can be had for around $12 and is a 4 star CD. This rip off amounts to $18 ($26 list!) for 4 songs! They know this is marketed towrds Tom Petty fans, and what fan hasn't already bought the CD? And who cares about leather packages and postcards! May the record company enjoy it's ride down the tubes."
5,Tom continues to be a musical treasure,"While I'm not sure yet that Highway Companion equals Tom Petty's very best, and it doesn't offer much new, Highway Companion is just good old Tom Petty music - and that's fine with me. ""Flirting With Time"" rocks with his best, ""Night Driver"" is one of his most haunting ballads, and ""Big Weekend"" has some nice Byrds-like melody. What's also notable are the mid tempo sizzlers here like ""Jack"" and ""Turn This Car Around."" The unadorned ballad ""Square One"" is very charming. Lyrically, the CD tends to be quite focused, but the lyrics are well written and can be appreciated by all. The Last DJ was a good CD, but it's nice to see Tom top it with Highway Companion."
4,Tom Petty's Highway Companion,"Good CD. It's not Damn the Torpedoes, Full Moon Fever, or Wildflowers, but it's good quality music worth listening to. It's not getting any air time on the Classic Rock stations in Seattle, but those guys have a severe case of tunnel-vision, so it's not surprising. Spend the money out of loyalty to a guy you grew up with."
5,Amazing! One of the Best of 2006,"I can't say enough good things about this Excellent album! It just gets better and better with every listen. There isn't one song on this thing that has to be skipped. It's Awesome from start to finish! If this album doesn't do well, then I guess there really is no hope for good music."
3,I want a really good TP album next time,"A few of these songs are good.....JUST ENOUGH to make the TP FANS starve for a really good HEARTBRAKERS album. THIS album, really is HALF finished. SOME of the songs just make everybody WANT MORE PETTY,.....others , well you just want to throw it away.THEY MAKE YOU NUTS. I hope TOM and the heartbrakers.....have a real good record next time...and one with at least 14 songs ( not these short rip off albums with 11-12 songs ). There really going to need it...MOST everybody I know agrees (ALOT of PEOPLE), that this album pulled tom petty down and it fans a bit....from there HIGH HORSE. SO....MAKE IT GOOD NEXT time PETTY...my money is waiting."
4,Two Traveling Wilburys,"go into a RocketShip to find their big brother Bob ... That's what it sounds to me . Tom even sounds like Bob in a couple of tunes . I like it a lot , specially the intorspective ones ... Tom is maturing and time is to be flirt with once in a while ..."
2,"I agree, I don't get the lyrics as well","I agree with the reviewer below. I don't like the style of writing or lyrics in this album. Besides 2 songs, maybe 3, you have to try to think to hard to understand the meaning of the songs. MUSIC ISN'T SUPPOSE TO BE A MATH TEST.When you listen to a song, your suppose to know what it means AND not have to read the lyrics and SOLVE THE PUZZLE. I do like, ""damaged by love"", and ""this old town"". Those you get fast and can understand, as-well as everbody else. "" SQUARE ONE also."
2,"Just buy ""Night Driver"" (the song)","I think I'll listen to this in its entireity about 5 times.But, then ""Night Driver"" - I have mp3'd it and will listen about 500 times! It's smooth, and sexy rock like ""Breakdown"" was! awesome! Also I dont get why Jeff Lynne is a sought after producer. Bring back Jimmy ""Damn the Torpedoes"" Iovine!"
2,who wrote the lyrics ??,"Good music,but diffently TOM PETTY's worst writing. YEP,the lyrics are bad.Real bad!!! Music is good (NORMAL), but the lyrics just bore the listener to death. Don't worry TOM, John mellencamp, and Bruce Springsteen have the same problem. When I listen to this album, i have know idea what tom is singing about. EXAMPLE. "" SAVING GRACE,TURN THIS CAR AROUND, JACK, GOLDEN ROSE , DOWN SOUTH "", etc. And what about that song about a HORSE? A HORSE ( THAT's RIGHT ). Are you kidding me !!! NO, a stupid horse!! What ever happened to singing about GIRLS,LIFE,FUN,SUNNY DAYS, and jump -up and down songs ? Isn't that how TOM got famous??? YEP!! But ,not on this album."
1,Poor Information,The pet toy that I actually received in the package was totally different from what was advertised. Beware.
1,buyer beware,"I bought this for my dad because he's really old school and refuses to use a camera that's not a 35mm. I thought this would be great for him, but it's made of really cheap plastic. You have to self-advance the film each time you take a picture which I wish I had known before purchasing. I don't think the disposable ones are this cheaply made to tell you the truth. Don't waste your money folks. Battery that was included was dead too, but that's not a surprise."
1,yeesh,"Did not enjoy or appreciate this book. Left me feeling antsy and irritated and furious, like its main character. Coulda done that on my own (in fact, it might have been inevitable). I suppose on some level the book connected with me, but it gave me little to work with beyond my own angst. Start again, and make your next book as unlike this one as possible. Please."
4,bold and rebellious,"Sorry, I appreciated this book because Chalmers was resonantly human and insightful into the human psyche. A moral and ethical being, he acquiesed to his position and upward mobility, but internally, he was a resonant human with needs for loved ones in his life, a sense of actuating himself, while still being appreciated by our society. These have become impossible goals: It's either go corporate or go dead for the contemporary ""Winston Smith's"" of our culture. Thus Chalmers began to deteriorate. It's scary, but totally plausible. All persons are, in fact, unique and watching others with the proper connections get ahead does not enhance. Sorry, but Lightman, a genius, gets many points in morality and ethics for promoting real people."
2,"Very odd...I think...well, maybe...could be...","EINSTEIN'S DREAMS so passionately involved me that I have read it over and over just to experience the flawless and beautifully lyrical prose, the wonderful images, the entire literary journey.THE DIAGNOSIS is a very different matter. I am not certain why the death of Socrates was part of this book. I am not certain what the illness of the main character is supposed to symbolize. I am not certain how the main character and his wife ever managed to have a child together. I am not certain what the wife's sister had to do with anything.The only thing I am certain of is my confusion. That said, The Lightman man sure does write pretty.Hunger"
3,I'll never visit a mall again...,"Disturbing, unsettling, and unresolved---and that's the way it was meant to be! I disagree with other reviewers who found Chalmers' wife and son to be uncaring and shallow; I believe they were simply other symptoms of societal estrangement. Love seemed to be the sole redemptive option, and the final scenes between father and son were poignantly touching.I value this book because of the way it has influenced my thoughts over the past few weeks. I think of the man in the story who is panicked because he will be out of cell phone contact for two minutes while his subway passes through a tunnel---not so different from those who must talk while speeding down the highway between meetings. The Diagnosis? An unbearable sense of inflated being."
2,Very puzzled...,"I was extremely bored by this book and had to make serious efforts to finish it. I kept hoping it would start to make sense at some point... but it just didn't. I too raced through the last hundred pages or so, trying to find something worth pausing on -- without luck. Why am I puzzled? Well, what was the message of this book? It made absolutely no sense to me, and I couldn't find any cohesion whatsoever. I could understand the e-mail and chat passages, as well as the Socrates story, but what did one have to do with the other? Or with Bill's illness/problem/poisoning/whatever-that-was? I am still waiting for the ""englightment"" and the ""a-ha"" of understanding. Conclusion -- you can read this book if you want to, but don't expect too much. And be prepared to spend a lot of time on it..."
2,void for vagueness,"The strong first chapter implies many questions about our notions of self identity will be raised and explored. However, after Bill's night in the city, his life and my interest slowly seep away. I waited, minute by digital minute, for someone, anyone, to please bring at least one of the story lines into focus. Oh author, where art thou?"
3,"Confused thoughts about ""the Diagnosis""","I found that once I began this book, I had to finish it. It was excellent craftsmanship. But having said that, I can't say I understand what the book was trying to say. The inclusion of the fictional segment on the death of Socrates, while fascinating, seemed like a non-sequitor. Obviously, there was a father/son tension between the Athenian father and son, as in the main character's relationship with his son, but the pairs of relationships were not parallel, by any means. Also, I wanted to know what really happened to this contemporary character. And what would happen to him. Maybe I like ""happy"" endings, or just ""endings"". This one left me troubled and uncertain about what the previous 3 hours of reading all boiled down to. As for humor,...well, I didn't find much humor in the tale. Just horror and tragedy for all the characters, except maybe for Socrates, who was the only serene character depicted."
2,Diagnosis: boring,"I have read ""Einstein's Dreams"" many times, often recommending it to friends with short attention spans. I read ""Good Benito"" more than once, also. Lightman struck me as a powerful storyteller; his colorful use of imagery, movement and time painted a nice, full picture. I was disappointed with ""The Dianosis"". I never said Lightman had a way with character development, but in the other books there were ideas and philosophizing enough to entertain. This book was just boring--I think it could have been written 100 pages lighter."
2,Don't waste your time,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading a book review in a major newspaper. While originally taken with the story line, it degenerates into a story I couln't wait to be over. I would not recommend this book."
2,Save your time,"The premise of the book sounded cool but I was disappointed overall. Technology is suffocating society ... the point was made but I found myself lacking much compassion for Bill. The book left me feeling, well, numb (and I suppose that was the whole point)."
1,The Diagnosis,"I too wish you could rate a book as 0.The plot was slow, boring, and never seemed to go anywhere but downhill. The only mildly interesting part was the sokrates. I agree with others who figure the wife was in on it but frankly, I didn't care by the end of the book anyway.If you have a choice of reading the toothpaste tube ingredients or this book, I'd take the toothpaste tube ingredients."
4,Hard to review,"I imagine many people will take this wonderful novel as an indictment of the age we live in; driven by technology, some might say devoid of spirit and soul. And I suppose it would be wrong to say it's not.More accurately though, it is an indictment of people who use technology as a crutch to navigate the travails of everyday life, at the expense of interpersonal relationships. It is an indictment of people who believed that have only one course of action, when the fact is, they are too blind to see the other paths they might take.This is an amazing, moving novel, that offers great insight into our collective (flawed) state of mind at the dawn of the 21st century."
1,Not for everone...,"I must say that this is one of the most unentertaining books I have ever read. If you are looking for a good summer read, this is NOT it. While the author's observations regarding today's fast-paced, technology dependant society are amusing at first, they quickly grow tiresome and boring. How sad it is to read an entire novel and not care one iota about any of the characters. I kept waiting for the storyline to get interesting, for the plot to evolve, but nothing. This is one book which I was happy to finish and get on to something better."
2,Boring,"I gave up in the middle of this book. I'm oddly reluctant to do that with a book, but slogging through this one just wasn't worth it. No, people don't make that many typos in their emails, and even if they did, the typos here are a distracting device that misses its mark. It's true that Einstein's Dreams is exquisite, and that maybe people are harder on his lesser works. But acknowledging that doesn't make this a better book, nor does it dispel the downward trend in quality in Mr Lightman's novels."
2,Diagnosis: Poor,"A poorly argued and heavy handed polemic in novel's clothing, with wooden characters and an obvious, plodding plot. It's clear that Lightman is trying to say something ""significant"" about the dehumanizating impact of technology, but it's all been said before, and better, by more talented writers and deeper thinkers. One expects more from this author, though there were in fact signs of decline in his second effort, the barely noticed ""Good Benito""."
2,A real downer,"After reading the book, I was left with a puzzled, confused emptiness. The theme and the meaning of the book were baffling. I finished reading the book only because I hoped to have resolution.but was disappointed."
1,Diagnosis: Severe Disappointment,"It is hard for me to believe that this is the same guy who wrote the beautiful and hypnotic Einstein's Dreams, and even more difficult to imagine that this is a later work. The book reads like the plot of a TV movie, and not a particularly good one at that. Each character is an easy stereotype, and when Mr. Lightman tries to draw even stereotyped characters outside his own milieu he is even weaker. I kept waiting for this sorry job to get better, and it never did. I only finished it out of a sense of disbelief; it was a complete waste of my time."
1,ugh,"I listened to this book ( 10 Cds!) waiting for something to happen.... waiting, waiting, ( does this sound like the book) and was just totally disappointed in the book. It went no where after a very exciting beginning and left me totally cold. If you are thinking of reading it, don't."
4,Nice figures,"These figures are well made and look great, especially for the price. The magnets are a little heavy and do not stick too well. I may have to add another to them so they will not slide down the fridge."
1,useless,I got this pack cause it looked very useful. but it isn't. the big flap opens for no reason and it's secured by two big buckles. it wouldn't even hold my lunch and a few books. I liked the look and the fit but it wasn't functional.
4,Really not butyl tape but does the job,"AMAZON advertises this as butyl - it isn't, nor does the package state that it is nor does the manufacturer's web site (difficult to find) it's regular putty tape. But, with that said, it does work very well, does what this kind of tape should"
1,Bad job Amazon,"I ordered the tank cover from Amazon and had to return it twice as both times they sent only the front half of cover. After second time I called customer sevice, who were helpfull and refunded my money but stated they could not correct the problem at the shipping facility. They said they would have to take down the listing however I see it's still here. I also called CAMCO directly and they told me I should have been shipped 2 halves but it was Amazon's repacking that was responsible.Amazon I love your service but let's get it right with this or you will have a lot of unhappy campers."
5,Max Factor Linemaker Eyeliner is the best,"I have been wearing waterproof eyeliner since 1975. The absolute best eyeliner ever produced was Max Factor's Linemaker eyeliner. I could apply it and go swimming all afternoon and still have it look good hours later in the evening. I have never found another product to compare to it. I am lost without it and cannot understand why Max Factor or some other cosmetic company doesn't begin production on it again. I find this especially frustrating considering that eyeliner is quite popular right now. HELLO, COSMETICS EXECUTIVES - BRING IT BACK!"
5,Me name Jr. Gong..,"if you want Roots music, get the rude boy's first album, if you want the new frontier, ala his half brother Ky-mani Marley's second out of print CD ""the Journey"", get this, Halfway Tree is a melding of various music styles but all based on reggae, it's a fantastic CD, you just never get tired of listening to it. my fav track is More Justice, Still searching, Give dem some ways, and the last 9 minute double track...but it's all good...but his first CD is a classic roots album though and you can't contest that!"
1,extremely weak,"My God, he is struggling here. Get back to the roots! Karma deficit in this piece. I agree with a previous reviewer - stick with the first release style. Don't follow the lost and confused sheep. What would Daddy Marley say?Save yourself and don't buy this."
1,just plain sad,"As a long time lover of roots reggae and Bob Marley's music and vision, I find this album just plain sad. That it won a grammy for best reggae album of the year shows the sad state of reggae today. This is why I will continue to play the music made 15-25 years ago (the exceptions being Ziggy Marley's Spirit of Music CD and Luciano). Sheesh, am I getting old or is this cd just plain bad?"
1,What's This?!!!,"This album is a disaster from a reggae perspective. It won a grammy for Reggae album of the year......how that could happen is way beyond my comprehension. Damian has alot to learn (and upon writing this review he does have a song just released that I really like called ""Welcome To Jamrock"") about what Roots Reggae Music is. ""Jamrock"" may be his ticket if he can stay away from the rap crap so called Reggae that he usually sings.It kills me to see some of these Marley kids getting all the respect (Ziggy, Damian) when Ky-Mani Marley clearly blows themaway. The only other Marley that I give props to who seems to me will have a breakout album in the near future is Julian Marley. He seems to be on the right path and is just a matter of time."
1,Disappointment 2 De Fullest,There is only one or two tunes in this CD.I have had this cd since it came out..I have listened to it once..I don't know if I'll listen to it before I gave it away.What a disappointment? The more disappointment was when this album won a grammy instead of Beres Hammond's Music For Life!I wouldn't recommend it!
5,100% solid..,"Jr Gong is following his half brother Ky-mani's step by releasing this album that is cross over reggae CD..so manypop tracks, it's amazing none of it has made it into POP radio,especially when SO many rap groups (i include shaggy in that group) are doing Faux ragga rap..More Justice is one of the Killer tracks there..and there's a hidden track at the end of the last song..every track is good..just get it, and see howreal ragga is done, Hiphop ragga is a waste of time!"
5,evolved reggae...,"This album is intense, radiating Marley creativity with a political backdrop that spouts truth in every direction. I was instantly hooked on the nu-skool intelligence plastered over seriously phatty beats. Every track on this album is slammin and representative of the genre.If you like passionate, sensical, and political music with intelligent lyrics that can't be easily categorized or compared with much else, then this album is fa ya.Thanks to amazon.com for dropping a nice review of this album, which I agree with, except for the ""truly funny"" spoken-word that introduces the first track, which is phenomenal. I wonder if Rebecca heard what Bounty was saying or if she just heard the word ""monkey"" and lost track of the meaning...this album is evolved reggae, and wayyy dope. A must have for true heads.peace....!"
4,Is A Nice Album Still,"I no longer live in Jamaica and I try to get back the yardy vibes sometimes and there are just certain CD's that do it for.When I heard this CD awhile back,I thought it was annoying but my brother played out and during a road trip last summer I had it booming in my Sony walkman for two weeks straight.Now I am in China and between Junior Gong, Sizzla, and Richie Spice I feel like I am in paradise."
3,Not Bad,"I was expecting a lot more from this album and was so excited when it was released. I found it to be a disappointment, probably because my expectations were so high. I'd recommend his second album much more highly."
4,Dark Carnival should be a cult classic!,Dark Carnival is one of those rare no-name low-budgeters that could really make cult status. As it follows its some-what quirky characters through their escape from a haunted-haunted house one can feel the creative production atmosphere that must have gone into making this oddity. True boot-strap filmmaking and boy-next-door production ingenuity.
2,"Cool Name, Bad Movie","If you shell out the cash for Dark Carnival, don't be surprised if you throw it out the window. The acting was horrid, the effects worse, no real point. It was a movie wandering amlessly throughout where ever bad movies go. Movie heaven maybe, but unfortunatly Dark Carnival probally went to movie hell. I love cheesey horror flicks, but this was down right a waste of time. Rent if you are curious, but don't throw away your cash on such a bad flick."
1,Dark Carnival is a bust,"I was so glad to see this film on DVD. I was one of the lucky few who got to attend the first audience screening of this film way back in 1993. The film was made in my hometown and the headline in our local paper stated the following at that time: ""Local Film Cinematic Nightmare"". So much for civic pride!With cardboard acting, cheesy set design and cinematography that is so sub standard it makes John Russo look like Orson Welles,this feature was destined for the scrap heap (or at the very least the coveted 4:45am slot on Drive-in theater).If you like this one seek out ""Alex's Apartment"" for further reaearch into the local ""cinema subbasement"". Thank god for DVD!"
5,"Seeds, Seeds, Seeds",This was a wonderful book to use as a springboard for spring planting. I sent my grandchildren the book and bags that Buddy's grandfather sent to him. The children loved doing the projects created through the book.
2,Clueless times five,"Well, the girls were nice to look at. They weren't too bright and it took forever to get to the house where all the action was to take place. I don't see this one ever making anybody's must-see list. In fact, it was so slow moving that it was hard to sit through the whole thing. I did however, and the climax was much like the rest of the film...slooow. It lacked any kind of impact and then two words popped up on the screen that said: ""The End"" and I thought 'Really? That's it?"" The bottom line is, this film is watchable but not fun in any way at any level. If you must watch it, rent it. You probably would only watch it once anyway."
1,Just stay away...,"I rented this because hey, cheerleaders and slashers go together like peanut butter and jelly.Don't bother.The girls are good looking but there's no nudity or sex. Or cheerleading for that matter.The camera work and sound are very poor.The killer is neither scary nor cheesy, he's barely even in the film.So with no scares, no gore, and no plot there is no reason to ever watch this."
1,You have got to be kidding,WHAT a joke!!! I can't believe someone actually had the audacity to make this piece of trash!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not as pictured,The woolly mammoth I recieved does not look like the picture. The trunk on the toy mammoth I recieved has a ridiculuously long trunk that bumps and curls under and back a weird c shape. I am not very happy with it and I haven't decided if I'm keeping it (to give as a gift) or returning it. The fur doesn't look as fluffy as it appears in the picture.
3,"Canadian Poetry, Volume Two",Covers Contemporary Canadian poets from Margaret Atwood to Michael Ondaatje and Dennis Lee. An interesting and eclectic mix. Well worth reading on a quiet rainy afternoon.
3,not up to the hype,"this is not your typical Boss Hog/PJ Harvey rip off. who ever programmed the beats and did the production is really talanted. the vocalist has an amazing sex kitten voice. however i wasnt feeling her lyrics. she repeats one sort of sexy line per song, then a chants bunch of random vocal filler for three minutes. come on. its not that hard to write funny explicit lyrics. little kim and trina seem to be MUCH more talanted MCs."
1,One more handclap and it would have been an annoying record...,"When this record came out, electroclash had all the hype, and many people bought it just for that. (Right now there's nothing as ""uncool"" as electroclash and the term itself) but let's be honest here, there's NOTHING to enjoy about this particular crap. The whole album is full of handclaps and beats that are almost the same, vocals are really annoying and boring. And the so-called ""punk attitude"" is sooooo fake. Trust me, there are hundreds of better records in this kind of mood (pretended mood) For example: Adult, Miss Kittin, Mount Sims, Tiga, etc, etc, and a very long etcetera. And I'm sure this product will fill the ""used"" section in most record stores in the future."
2,What a pretentious drag,"Or -- a pretentious drag that's just not to my tastes. Will probably be forgotten in another 5 years, an obsolescence in contrast to the unusual amount of attention it received upon release. Nice cover, though."
3,fair,This is an ok album! Not the greatest but quite entertaining at times. I hope her follow up will be better!
2,Vulgarity as mediocre substitute,"What contributed to punk's early hedonism was its unflagging energy and passionate, purposeful lyrical content. This album represents a futile manipulative attempt at the genre's sonic invention but loses immediacy through the uninspired vocals. For such perpetual vulgary to work, the delivery must be more energetic and convincing. This is Lords of Acid without the more obvious, good natured posturing."
3,File Under Novelty Record,"Or file under eletro schlock... Do not beleive the hype of this being a punked out beat driven mother of a record. What punk sound it has is sampled, and repetitive at best. I'm sorry, but when I think of punk, I think hardcore, and this ain't hardcore. The beats? Big fat beats, which change very little from song to song. I will admit the beats are sleazy sounding, but whoopty doo. The lyrics? [NOT GOOD], in an I'm 16 years old mom and dad, and this is what I like to offend you with! A good example of the lyrics is when she belts out ""gimme your wad."" No joke, she says it, but none the less funny to hear. All in all, it is good for a laugh, just don't take it too seriously. If you want the punked out beat driven mother, get Black Cat #13, just don't expect any witty lyrics about ""giving your wad."""
2,Stupid,The beats are realy realy good ! But the singing sucks like hell.Every other sentance has f me or f you in it. This is a very weird style of music. I only gave it 2 stars because it has good techno beats. It also has way to much profanity and the words always repeat themselves. Super annoing !
3,I don't think this item is necessary,I thought this would be an added convenience for my wife but the sound quality is lacking and basically amounts to a sub-par speakerphone. Most of us have one of those already with our existing cell phones. It does work better than the microphone on the unit though.
4,Must have if you use the handsfree feature of the Nuvi,"Works as it should. No noise cancellation means it can get a little noisy but it's better than my phone's speakerphone option. Personally I find the nuvi's built-in mic too lousy to use, as all my callers will complain that they can't hear me. I also left myself messages in my voicemail to test the quality and my conclusion is that the External Microphone offers the best quality vs using my phone's or the Nuvi's built-in mic.Also comes with two mounting options - a non-adhesive one that will clip to your visor, and another with an adhesive mounting strip which you can stick to the side pillar or somewhere close to your mouth. :)Hope this helps!"
3,No real benefit,"I purchased this external microphone hoping for an drastically improved quality to my Garmin Nuvi 360's speakerphone capability. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the slight improvement this accessory made wasn't worth the additional cost and wiring running around my car. I initially tried the microphone out by calling my wife (who always complains that she can't understand me with just the speakerphone). She stated that the sound quality was slightly better than before. Next, I tried calling my office voicemail several times with and without the external microphone (in different positions). I could not notice a significant improvement in call quality except when holding the microphone very close to my mouth.Some users may find that mounting the microphone as a lapel mic may drastically improve quality, but that wasn't a practical option for me. The relatively low cost may justify trying this unit out, but don't expect a huge jump in sound quality."
4,A Must-Have for Bluetooth Users,"When I first got my Garmin nüvi 760 Portable GPS Automobile Navigator and started using its Bluetooth feature, I got consistent complaints from callers saying they couldn't hear me. This $15 microphone has made a world of difference. No more complaints from callers!I only gave this little microphone four stars instead of five, because despite its three different mounting clips, I haven't yet found a way to keep the mic close and the clip/wire out of the way. Just a minor nitpick though!"
1,Did not work,I ordered this thinking it would fit a garmin 765t which it should. I recieved the product and it did not fit the garmin unit. I e-mailed the Car Toys about this issue on on 3/29 asking for assistance but have yet to here from them. I guess I'm just going to have to eat the cost for a product that does not work.
2,Not worth,I could not see the difference when using the microphone and when not.I have tried multiple locations on my car and the results were always the same. Maybe a noise cancelling mic will make a difference (just wondering...)
1,No improvemnt over internal GPS mic,This mic is no better than using the internal mic with the GPS. Wast of money.
4,Makes hands free work,This mic makes the difference between hands free phone use being functional or not. Before I had it people would complain they could barely hear me and there was a lot of background noise. Now with the mic installed on my visor I just talk normally and never get a complaint. The wire is easy enough to conceal down the pillar and the Garmin mount has a mic input (my 760 does anyway) so you don't have to plug it into the GPS itself.It comes with various mounting methods. The only weakness is that the ball & socket which holds the mic to the mounting clip is easy to pop loose.I strongly recommend this if you really want to use your phone hands free.
2,Didn't work in my vehicle,This mic works but almost everyone I talked to said it sounded worse than using the built in mic.
4,Good sound quality,This product is great for the hands free cell phone user. The sound quality of the calls is much clearer and it helps block out traffic noise.
2,"Louder, but not much better than internal Mic","Bought this for my C550, as most people I call told me that the voice quality over the internal mic was garbled and echoey. Well, After much use of this mic, the verdict is, while louder, still not much clearer. Then, today I tried my computer mic with a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter and 3 people on the other end told me that it was a DRAMATIC improvement in sound. What does that tell me? This mic ain't that great. Yes, since you can place it closer to your mouth, it's louder, but it is still a very low quality microphone. The cheap PC mic had far superior clarity and produced much better results. So, this is going to the trash, and I am going to purchase an Olympus ME-52 Noise Cancelling Mic and try that. This mic just isn't very good"
1,Garmin External Microphone - Waste of Money,"I recently bought a Garmin Nuvi 765T. My previous GPS was a Garmin Nuvi 750, which didn't have the Bluetooth option. The main consideration for buying the new GPS was for Bluetooth..... Do yourself a huge favor and save some money in the bargain.... Bluetooth in the Garmin 765T is NON-FUNCTIONAL, in every profound way. I was unable to carry on cellphone conversations and got bad reports from everyone I tried to talk to. They said the audio was distorted and I was ""in and out"". Sooooooooo, I bought the Garmin external microphone, hoping to solve the problem.... It too proved to be a waste of money and is of no benefit, whatever. The Garmin 765T is not the quality unit my Garmin 750 was. I made two costly mistakes. My mistakes don't have to be your mistakes.... You can learn from my experience and I hope I've saved you some money.............."
2,Where's the gel,"Not very gelified. Very thin, did not cover as expected. The color is also very, very white, so it wouldn't work correctly with pickled oak finish."
3,Need ruler in item picture or american measurement.,"This item is nice, but it should have a ruler in the item picture. I was surprised at how small 4.6 MM and 16 grams is. --- UPDATE! I found out after writing this review that the wrong and much smaller 1 MM item was sent to me. I returned it."
4,"THERE AIN'T BUT 1 (ONE) GABOR SZABO!!! IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS FILLED THOSE SHOES, WOULD HE OR SHE PLEASE STEP FOWARD!","Gabor Szabo has ALWAYS had a unique way of playing Jazz Guitar and he really shined on almost all of his Impulse Recordings. On this 1967 Impulse release we find our Guitar Master recorded 'Live' in a intimate setting at The Jazz Workshop (Boston, Massachuesettes). The Compact Disc opens up a Jazzed-Up version of ""The Beat Goes On"", Plus Steller performances of: ""Little Boat"", ""Space"", and ""Mizrabi"". This entire Compact Disc clocks in at 38:00 (Thirty-Eight Minutes) and I'm pretty sure MCA (Universal Music Group) could have came up with some Bonus Tracks and/or Alternate Takes from the 2 (Two) nights of recordings from thisfrom this engagement! Even a Two-Fer Package would have been a real treat! But for now you'll just have to live with (And enjoy) THIS Compact Disc!"
5,"To put it plainly, one of the best Christmas albums ever. Ever!","My title says it all. Lanin's wonderfully smooth Main Line Philly ""society"" sound, artful arrangements, and creative touches have made this a treasured Christmas treat in my family for two generations (my father, sisters and I all have our own copies on CD). A must-have for everyone who enjoys good Christmas music!"
2,Dense and confusing,"This book covers a lot of material. The quality varies from chapter to chapter. Figures are sprinkled here and there with very little explanation of what they mean. Additionally, there is not much consistency between figures. This book might be serve as a good companion to a course, but it's virtually useless for self study.My background is engineering and neuroscience, but I still found the math to be poorly explained. If you're trying to learn about biophysics and cellular neurophysiology, pick another book. If you're unfortunate enough to have this book assigned to you for a class, make sure you attend the lectures.The index is also terrible and virtually useless for anything that I've tried to look up. The only good thing about the book is that it references a lot of stuff, so you know where to look.One star is for the breadth of topics covered and one is for the references. The Matisse drawing on the cover is also a nice touch."
2,Pick a different book,"This was the assigned text for a short section on electrophysiology in my first year graduate neuroscience course. I did not have a math or electronics background, but had worked in a neurophys lab for two years. I managed to learn stuff from this book, but it was hard work and I couldn't have done it without my lecturer and classmates. It's obvious that the authors really know their stuff, but being able to explain it to novices is another thing... And I agree with the other reviewer who noted that the index is *completely* useless, almost random lists of page numbers after topics...Unless you have to buy this book for a class, skip it (and if it is the text for a course, ask your instructor why!!)- buy Molecular and Cellular Physiology of Neurons by Fain instead, it doesn't cover as many topics, but breadth is no use if you can't understand the content. My department switched to the Fain text last year because so many people complained about Johnston et al."
5,"Melodic, Dark, Ghostly, Acoustic, Mellow & Uplifting Guitar Driven Music!","Thanks Marty! I've been enjoying this album off and on since it came out in 92! This has got to be one of the best albums that will stick with you forever! It's an awesome, trippy ghostly album! Very melodic and guitar driven beats meats poetry/art...but with his own touch! At the same time it's Marty's singer songwriter capability that pulls this excellent album through! 'Luscious Ghost' is definitely my favorite, while 'Will I Start To Bleed', 'I Can't Cry', and 'Kiss You To Death' are close first favorites also! You have to love the breezy sounds throughout the whole CD! It's one of those albums that you can listen to from start to finish all the way through! If you don't have it, go get it, enjoy it in your bedroom, car, vacation, rainy day, kick back and ""read the sleeve notes through""!"
4,Figaro Bracelet,"I brought this bracelet and was pleased on how comfortable it wears,half the time I don't realize that I have it on! Also my friends want to know where I got this from so they might purchase there's. So if you are lookin' for a bracelet I think this would be for you!!"
3,"pretty wide, kind of deep","Maybe I don't have the background to appreciate the subtlety of the author's arguments; but it seems to me there is a great deal of assertion and not enough explanation. The author generally does not introduce or explain terms, including obscure acronyms (fortunately there is a good glossary). Often, by the time I have looked up the terms and acronyms and put the author's statement together for myself there is nothing left to understand - in other words it appears the author would be adding little value for a reader that actually has the knowledge he assumes. The index is generally poor and the text obviously has not had the editorial support it deserves. The author does cover a lot of ground and touches on many topics, and the book consistently addresses a technical professional reader. This book could have value as a resource or reference, as one member of a library; by itself it occupies an unusual middle ground, neither introduction nor deep discussion."
3,Evaluation of the systematic generation of Jacobians,"The book presents a systematic technique to generate Jacobians for arbitrary serial manipulators. Unfortunately, the intuitive approach to Jacobian generation is not discussed, and readers with no alternative reference will have to follow their rather tedious method. Overall, the book is ok, despite small recurring errors."
3,"standard reference, but not very readable","This was the textbook in my manipulator robotics class; we used the J.J. Craig ""Introduction to Robotics"" book as a secondary reference. While this book covers all of the major topics in detail, the treatment is less than straightforward; contrast this to the Craig book which provides less information (completely omitting differential kinematics, for example), but is far more readable. Many of the derivations that the authors employ are unintuitive. I'll recommend this book, but only until I find a good alternative."
3,Plain and Boring...,This book is one of the most boring books that I ever had to read. It was painful and NO it did not inspire me to become the best damn robot designer in the world. Instead I opted for Power Engineering...
5,Love at First Taste,As soon as I heard the health benefits on Dr. Oz I went right to my laptop to order. I purchased the 11 pound bucket {Rolands}which was an excellent buy. When it came I thought OMG it's such a big bucket! Well soon as I tasted it I fell in love with lingonberries.I took ordinary Premium crackers spread a little cream cheese and half a spoon of the lingonberries on top. Once you taste it you wanna have more and more. Love the flavor and the cream cheese was great with it. I had to fill a jar with some and not have to keep taking the bucket out of the refrigerator. Can't wait to taste this with chicken and pork etc. I live at the NJ shore near the big cranberry bogs. But I am enjoying the lingonberries as they are much more delicious and I get all the added antioxidants which is important to me as a cancer survivor.I have been recommending it to my friends.
4,Roland Lingonberries,Jelly is a little bit bitter on its own but when added to buttered toast it tastes delicious. The benefits of this berry it outstanding for you so I hightly recommend trying it.
5,"""the best oriole feeder made""","This was a replacement for one exactly like it which we actually had for over 10 years. It only gave out because of the sun damage. It has been feeding orioles, hundreds up them over the years. Between the orioles and hummingbirds we go thru 20 - 25 pounds of sugar each summer. They are the of our joys of summer."
3,AS ADVERTISED,"No leaks; feeds orioles and hummers; x-large capacity; sturdy, even perches. The only down-side is that it allows my neighbor's HONEY BEES TO FEED IN SWARMS, which keeps orioles and hummers from feeding... If you don't have honey bees, this may be the feeder for you."
5,oriole feeder,"This feeder holds a large amount of liquid -- I would recommend two or three of them if you have a lot of birds, hummingbirds can drink out of them also."
5,Oriole nectar feeder,"After haviong tried many types of oriole feeders, this one is definitely the best on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Leaks,"Have the feeder hanging on a hook and when the wind blows the liquid leaks (pours) out of the port holes when the feeder tips from being blown! What a mess on the ground below the feeder (and ant attraction), and waste of the liquid."
4,Birds love it!,I got this feeder after my Audubon feeder broke. I like it a lot more. It held more nectar and didn't fill with water when it rained. The only downside is that it doesn't have an ant guard. Also the flower ports have a little dam in them and the instructions didn't say what position to put them in. I didn't have any problem with leaking once I made sure the bottom was snapped on securely.
2,oriole feeder,"Have excellent luck with attracting orioles with this feeder, but this feeder has a tendency to leak. Had to add tape to keep it from leaking."
3,Leaks!,"I purchased this product after trying several other Oriole feeders. I was excited when I read the good reviews that this one recieved. Then I filled it, all the liquid dripped out of it from the bottom. My Husband put a strip on electrical tape on it and snapped on the bottom. It is ok now!"
3,Hard to clean,"We only have one pair of Oriole's that come to this feeder. (lack of Oriole population) Then the humming birds started to take over. Last summer the only ones to used this feeder were the honey bees. There was a day when you could hardly see the bottom of the feeder due to the bees. But as far as attracting Oriole, it works. The one big down side is: Very hard to clean. I ended up buying some BB's from walmart and filling the feeder with them. Then I would spin the feeder and let the BB's spin all over the inside. That got the inside nice and clean."
2,Deighton can write good books; this is not one of them,"This book was a huge disappointment in every respect. The characters were very promising, but the story went absolutely nowhere. Details piled upon details and irrelevant background information in the middle of the story do not make a book that is either worthwhile or enjoyable to read. Add to that an ending (of sorts) that left me wondering why I had even bothered finishing this book and wishing that I hadn't, and you have a book that you, dear fellow readers, would be better off skipping. The reviewer who characterized this book as ""dreary"" got lambasted with a ""0 of 4 found this review to be helpful,"" but the characterization was dead on. In summary, I loved the characters, but nothing about the story itself."
1,childish,"Len Deighton is 3 different writers. His first books (1962-82) are directionless, pointless, storyless, boring.His Bernard Samson books are good.After that (mamist, city of gold) he goes into his second childhood with simpleton, stupid, unbelievable plots and characters.Not recommended"
4,"Is a good story and moves quickly, but.....","I read this book right after a Tom Clancy novel, and well, it's hard to compete with the master, Tom Clancy. I would probably have enjoyed this more if I had read it first. The plot just wasn't near as exciting as the the Clancy book, and I think that did play a part in my opinion of this book. All in all though, it was a good book and well written"
5,Amazing,"From start to finish this album is a classic. When I got it I was in HMV and saw in on the shelves for 8.99 and I had previously heard 10:45 Amsterdam conversation which is a great song, so I bought the album. I have always been a big fan of this kind of music. FFAF make bands such as Finch, Poison the Well, Hoobastank look tallentless. Every song is great, which is normally hard to find in an album. The best are Bullet Theory and Escape artists never die. They are the best songs my ears have ever heard.BUY IT!"
1,this cd sucked,"this is one of the worst cd's i have ever listened to. If you enjoy music that encourages you to murder your parents, or siblings, then this music is for you. if you are suicidal and would like to kill yourself, this might be a good cd to kill yourself to because it is so horrible."
5,"Dear Heidi Kakes, GET A LIFE","Dear Heidi Kakes,If you like Jazz music then good for you. Do not waste your time ""reviewing"" CD's other than jazz just to say ""dear ____, I don't like you"". Guess what? they probably dont like you either. You are wasting the space on the page where people with intelligent and thought-out opinions can say something and give other people some insight into whether they should buy a certain cd or not. This CD is a good CD as a matter of fact, FFF does a good job of alternating between screaming and singing and the guitar work is also well done. I recommend the CD to anyone who likes the emocore/screamo/whatever you call it type of music - you wont be disappointed."
5,Their best,"Sadly, but this one is the best album by Funeral for a friend -- it has all you need, except self-copying and straight forward ""copypaste"" from other guys in this freaking musical business. At least, whole album is really good."
5,This is the best British band I have ever heard!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I heard about these guys was on the Projekt Revolution Tour with Linkin Park. I went and found their website and listened to some of their songs and was immediately hooked. They use awesome chords and melodies constantly during the album and back them up with a driving beats on everyone of the songs. The first full length album I bought from FFAF was ""Casually Dressed and Deep in Conversation"" and it has become one of my all time favorite albums. All their lyrics flow seemlessly on both their albums. I bought their other album ""Seven Ways To Scream Your Name"" a few months after the first one and I love it. If you like bands like Finch, The Used, Autopilot Off, or Sum 41 then you will like these guys. They don't disappoint. I can't wait until they come out with another album. If you want to know more about them, check out their website at www.funeralforafriend.com"
2,Meh,"I grew up on the fathers of modern metal... bands like Nirvana, Fudge Tunnel, and going back even further, Slayer.These bands are semi-legends; and FFAF compare like spoiled, whiney children. The music just sounds immature and needlessly shouty. There's no thought, it's noiseless squealing to chugging guitars with no sense of grandeur or passion or... anything, really. Just angst. We had enough of that with Korn. This gets two stars because it's well produced.This is music for 13-year old girls who have just discovered that Justin Timberlake doesn't really love them, and for 13-year old boys who have yet to drop their balls."
4,Very good effort from FFAF,"I wasn't sure about this album until I downloaded a couple of tracks mainly rookie of the year and escape artists never die. I got it and I have to say I'm impressed. FFAF have somehow managed to stay mostly under the radar, but I would have to say this album is better than Hawthorne Heights and right up there on my playlist with Underoath. From beginning to end FFAF lay down tracks that flow nicely with nice screaming intervals and the vocals which fit nicely into their style. This doesn't sound forced like much of Hawthorne Heights and many other bands like them. Although HH put out a good album I would pick this one up first. There aren't any throw away tracks on this one and the songs stand out from one another. Not a classic album, but a great listen."
3,So-so early stuff from a now great band,"Huge FFAF fan. Got into them when ""Hours"" came out, which I love. ""Tales Don't Tell Themselves"" and ""Memory & Humanity"" are even better than ""Hours."" After loving these albums so much, I figured I'd check out their older material. Wow, I was a little surprised. There are some great songs, like Rookie Of The Year, Juneau, & Escape Artists Never Die, but most of the album is just okay. I think the band was just going for screamo, which was the fad at that moment in time. Thank god they've grown up and become their own, ORIGINAL band. With the exception of a few songs, this CD is pretty boring, as it sounds like all the other stuff from that time (i.e. Thursday, Silverstein, etc.) Check out their latest albums for some great, original tunes."
5,"Funeral For a Friend, The New Rage","I purchased Funeral For a Friend because i heard their hit single, Juneau on the Projekt Revolution Player at the Linkin Park web site. This UK band has an awesome garage feeling and really gets you excited and pumped. The guys worked really hard on the album and you can really tell. With all of the popular rock bands going around, this CD really moves you. I would recommend it to any body."
5,best screamo ever!!!!,"This is the best cd i have ever listened to, they are the best screamo band ever. Every song on the cd is awesome. it has mainly heavier songs with amazing guitar leads, there are also a few slower songs. Bulet Theory , Escape Artists Never Die and Waking Up are the best songs on the cd."
4,"SEXY, MELLOW","Not beeing familiar with Danny's other works, I bought this based on a quote from the cover: ""what does Danny play when he's at home and there is no crowd to please but himself?"" I play it while working on line at night and, sorry to detractors, I think is is great, mellow ,sexy disk, worth my money. It gets my thumbs up, big time.I am also now checking out his other stuff, based on other reviewers recommendations."
1,Danny what happened,"now i understand that Danny Tenaglia is a great dj and all. but this was one of the worst cd's that i have ever purchased in my life. Danny is a great dj, and knows his deep sexy orgasmic house...i did not expect this to be the way it was. i ""returned"" the cd immediatley, for all of you Danny Tenaglia fans, and i'm one of the fans, not a huge one but a fan non-the less, this cd is absolutely disguisting! Do not get it...get his Athens cd' or Tourism..those are great...and thats all i have to say about that"
3,Back to Danny's,"As long as it keeps from being a marketing ploy, the ""back to mine"" series is a really intelligent idea. Its nice to be able to understand how the Dj's musical mind works when not behind the decks.That said, I would have to say that while this album does give us some very pretty sounds (Gentle People, Yello to the Sea, Rhythim of Life), it lacks the smooth, chilled glass continuity given by Nick Warren's take on the series (which is amazing).The music is more R&B flavored, but dips into every part of Danny's listening range (including Spanish Flea, which is a nice ender). It's good to chill out to...but you won't be floating in space amidst relaxation. If you want to do that get the Nick Warren.Basically the CD is strong, but I feel sorry for those looking for Danny's regular 4-on-the-floor bangin' beats..."
1,not worth the star i gave it,"Well boys and girls the next time you look up the word mistake you will see a picture of me holding this CD. What a waste of hard earned cash!!! this CD was such bore with what seemed to be a complete lack of imagination, not only on the part of Tenaglia but, on the part of the producers too. It seems like in todays Music industry creativity is a Bad word. SOOOooo incredibly boring... When I bought it I thought I was gonna get some smooth tunes maybe something to relax to but, NO!!! instead what I got was the worst display of.... ""I sold out and, now that my name can sell CD's who cares what I sell"" .....For those who like this CD I recomend a check up at your nearest Physicians A.S.A.P you might have Mono good luck but get a difrent CD"
2,JUNK,I should have know better than to buy this after seeing a track by CeCe Peniston. Don't waste your money.. i'm headed back now to return this junk
2,I traded it.,"Danny! we need more dark house and less flaky flamer disco, bud. But that was the hype for it, so it should have known.get the GU in ATHENS instead, groovers"
3,Bandwagon Release,"It seems everyone and their brother is rushing to come out with a mellow trip-hoppie, techno compilation album these days.I was not dissapointed in the the least that I bought this album - it's just that there are a lot of better albums out there (hence the 3 stars)such as ESL's ""Jet Society"" and Wallpaper* Magazine's ""Mach 1.5""."
4,Best of Collective Force,This CD is the best of Collective Force. You will recognize many of the tracks if you have their otherCDs. What's nice about this one is that all the familiar tracks are on one CD. Great sound!
5,Definately in my top 10,"I had heard 3rd Force on the smooth jazz station form time to time and this was the first CD of thiers that I purchased. If this was an album I would have worn it out by now. I know that ""purists"" turn their nose up at ""best of collections"" as this is but almost every song on here is great. ""Got to be Real"" and ""The Gift"" were two that I transferred to my MP3 player for my running but the more I listen the more I like each one. We all have CD's that we favor and this one finds itself in my car CD changer often."
3,"Eh, not so hot.","I bought this album on the strength of 'Bridge of Dreams.' Although the rest of the album is OK, there is little for me to get excited about. Very little improvisation, sparse almost barren arrangements and canned drums/cheesy cymbal sounds do not trip my trigger at all. Your mileage may vary."
2,more jazz than ambiant,I bought this album knowing nothing about 3rd. Force. I wish I hadn't. 3rd. force is not an ambiant group(e.g. no long instrumentals flowing through the ether) but a rather new agey contrived adult contemporary jazz offering. The tracks are basic uptempo muzak...zzzzz....look elswhere.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is, without doubt, the most useless reference material of its type that I've ever come across. There are more blank spaces than printed material, and what advice the book contains is so vague it's painful. The book is not worth one dollar, let alone twenty-nine."
3,"If You're Looking At Law School, Add To Your Reading List","This guide is a very basic overview of a few alternative careers for law school grads. If you're about to start work on your JD, or you are a big-firm lawyer looking for a change, this short book may be useful to you.I found the ""day in the life"" section the most interesting ... the publishers interviewed several people working in alternative legal careers and gave an example of their typical day, including their salary, background, years of experience, and advice to those seeking such careers.I do have to agree with the reviewer who complained that the price is too high for such a short review. I recommend trying to find a copy in your local library ... you can easily read it in one evening."
1,too difficult !,"This book is a failure. Einstein was a great scientist but a bad writer. The book is difficult, boring, and opaque to the unscientific layman.For three years I've been trying to get a book to teach me the two theories of relativity (General and Special) and I'm always disappointed: There must be a scientist out there who knows how to write ! Or maybe not."
4,Excellent source for those interested in Einstein's theory,"This book is great for those who are interested in the Theory of Relativity without getting involved too much in the mathamatical aspect. It is written very well, and shows that Einstein was capable of writing a piece that is easy for just about anyone to understand."
1,Harder than it needs to be,"This Dodo Press edition is riddled with annoying typos -- even in some equations and variable names. In addition the section numbers referred to in the text are only found in the table of contents, making navigation cumbersome.A classic like this deserves better. Look for another edition."
1,Something Important Is Missing.,"This version does not have any diagrams, only refs to nonexistant GIF image files.This is involved stuff here, a reader needs the illistrations.Please explore the other versions even if they cost more. Without the formula images this is just about unreadable."
5,Relativity,"Relativity, explained by Einstein hiself. A classic even to laymen and an idol to scientists, this book remains a treasury of knowledge.Relativity is often portrayed as a complex and mathematical lesson. In this book Einstein explains relativity free of the mathematics and complications. As Einstein once said ""Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore."" (Never a truer word spoken).Perfect for professional or amatuer scientists. A classic."
4,Want to know more about the general theory of relativity?,"This is a very interesting book. Time is required to make some sense of the issues in the book, but if you're reading this review you're probably interested enough in making time. Time, time and more time. I would have liked it if there was more mathematics in the explanations. If you are not mathematically minded this is a good read."
4,"Readable, for the Science-Minded","This is a good, concise exposition of general and special relativity from the man who wrote the book. However, it will be above the heads of some... If you're interested in reading this book, I'd suggest looking for it in the library to see if it's really the book for you. Or even browse the text in a bookstore before you buy. If you think you'll need a course in Calculus, find a review of the theories that you can follow."
4,A Masterpiece,"This book, written by Albert Einstein, is about the concept that changed our approach to physics and to the universe. This book requires a lot from a reader, in which the reader will probably have to reread passages all over again to grasp the math behind this theory. The math isn't difficult, it's understanding how it leads to the theory that requires a lot of thinking. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the theory of relativity from Einstein's approach. However the reader should have a minimum of understanding of the theory before attempting to read this book."
4,Requires a Mature Reader,"I've used this book with my high school students - very slow going. You can definitely understand the issues involved in relativity, even as a layman, from reading this book, but THIS IS NOT AN EASY READ! A mature, dedicated reader will get through this book. I'm proud of my high school students for struggling through this book, but readers at that age mostly do not have the intensity to really appreciate it."
1,The worst printing of a classic great book,"This book has been reprinted by a whole variety of publishers, and I bought this to replace a copy I lost to loaning it out.It looks like it was copied from a fax printout. This is not even worth the low price and it is in insult to Einstein."
1,Excellent Content - HORRIBLE PRINTING,"This review focuses not on the content or ideas as written by Einstein (which are excellent) but instead on the printing by Ancient Wisdom Publications (ISBN 978-1-936690-01-5).This book feels like it was scanned, given a basic once-over for any huge mistakes, and then sent out to print. It suffers from numerous spelling and typographical errors, but more importantly, the equations and diagrams are atrocious! I believe they scanned all tables, equations, and images, and then enlarged them. The images are all blurry and poorly printed. Some of the equations are unreadable because the parenthesis or square root signs are so blurred.Unfortunately (as other reviewers have pointed out), Amazon lumps all reviews for a work together, even for different printings. I'm convinced that the 5 stars for this book wouldn't be showing up for this specific printing. I encourage you to be sure what you are buying, and to preview the book first!"
2,"If you don't already know the theory, don't bother...","I hate to be the only one to not give the book ""5 stars"", but this is simply not the best book to buy if you want to learn the theory of relativity. The book is certainly worthwhile if you want something simply because it was written by Einstein, but God bless him, the old guy just couldn't put the idea accross as well as many modern authors. Maybe something is just lost in the translation, I don't know..."
2,Come back later,"Even though this book is marketed (and meant) as an accessible exposition of relativity theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not as easy to read as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than high-school knowledge of the relevant subjects. Maybe this was true in his time, but nowadays the book demands way more than that. I'm myself a grad student in the field of literature and I simply couldn't follow the presumably basic mathematical demonstrations Einstein relies upon to make his points. Some concepts are also less than obvious for the non-specialist ('galilean coordinates'?). This is not to say that the book itself is not good, but that it is targeted at a readership which is not necessarily trained enough to benefit from it."
3,Very interesting but written early last century and difficult for me to follow.,Since my math skills are very weak I'd have done better with a book geared more toward my level of knowledge of math and science.
3,Herr Einstein kept it simple!,"I have been researching Dr. Einstein's Special and General theories of Relativity. Most of the equations, I believe, came from the assistance of Minkowsky, Grossmann, et al close to him and trusted friends and colleagues. Once the reader begins to grasp Einstein's thought experiments, the mind explodes into a reason that seems simple but very difficult to comprehend as working the imagination and cosmic mathematics that can not be solved! There's no solutions for infinity.It can not be comprehended. In this realm, Einstein washis best-pure simple reason into the complex. Good book!"
3,Worthwhile Read,This is a very short book and is quick reading. I have read other books with better explainations of relativity. I didn't like the writing style -- it was translated by an Englishman in the early 20th century so the sentence structure doesn't flow like normal reading.
4,Straight from the horse's mouth,"What better person to here about relativity than Einstein himself? This is a great book for anyone interested in relativity. I do have one problem with this book--it's a crappy translation, even taking into account the fact that it was written in the dialect of Great Britain. The language is too lugubrious for my taste."
3,"Review of Einstein's Relativity, the Special and General Theories","Einstein himself wrote a 1918 paper which is not generally discussed, and which basically agreed that parts of the special theory were contradicted by the 'twin paradox'. The theory is pushed so hard in some quarters that any contrary thoughts are simply quashed. The special theory, especially the thought that their is no such thing as absolute space, is, in my view, simply wrong. Many have written on this subject, for instance the Australian, Builder, but they are ignored by establishment science, which is not science at all but rather politics, and dirty politics at that. That is not to say the Einstein was like that, but rather those who support his theory for political reasons."
2,Relativity as explained by Einstein,Languge used to explain his case difficult to understand in the extreme. Following the mathematics very difficult. This book written for scientists and mathematicians.
5,probably the best book about molecular vibration,"It is probably the best book about molecular vibrations, cited in many other books.It treats complex arguments with rigour but at the same time it is able to explain them clearly."
2,Little Raman Here,"Book has over 300 pages, maybe 12 pages mention Raman. Book is old 1965, Raman is new. Tossing in the word Raman a dozen times does not update or make the book current.Never mentions Stokes or anti-Stokes."
2,Not a Representation of the Great Talent of R.L. Stine,"Night Games never reached any great heights and I don't think many readers will be satisfied with the weak ending of what was a very predictable novel and not at all the high quality of the majority of Stine's work.In Night Games a gang of kids run into a former friend they haven't seen for a year. He invites them to accompany him on his night games of vandalism and terrifying locals. Being losers these kids readily agree. They all hate their math teacher Mr Crowell so target him for frequent night games, justifying it as vengeance for the way he treats them. Diane the main narrator of the story starts to question if Cromwell deserves the increasing severity of their tormenting until too late she realises just how deadly serious some of the gang want vengeance.Read one of Stine's other books instead."
3,MY REVIEW FOR NIGHT GAMES,"I WASN'T TOO CRAZY ABOUT NIGHT GAMES. I MEAN, IT WAS OKAY, BUT IT WAS JUST TOO WEIRD. ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. THAT WAS CREEPY AND STRANGE! IF YOU WANT TO READ THIS BOOK, GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY. WHO KNOWS, YOU MAY ENJOY MORE THEN I DID!"
3,You can do better than this!,"This Fear Street Triller isn't quite good.The plot wasn't intriguing.For istance,How can hugging people kill them?That's why I rate it three stars."
2,Terrible characters...,"The characters are so dull and come off as unsympathetic. The plot of the book is fine. However, it's not one of R.L. Stine's best. I liked ""Silent Night 3"" or ""The Runaway"" best."
4,Good Rock with no showing off,I dont care what anyone says Rock music doesnt need solos.I ahte bands that do constant solos and this band is one of those bands that doesnt need a solo in every song to show their talented. Thye are just having fun they dont care if they tget to show their skills or not that is what playing musics about. Having fun. Thats why I and anyother musician paly. Its good to see that some bands are finnaly realizing this. THis badns great. My fav tracks are WHisper and Movies. You should run out and get this CD. It would ahve gotten five stars if not for the fact that Michael Jackson [is in it].
3,let's see...,"I actually bought this cd because i loved the song Movies. Smooth Criminal had been overplayed by the radio, and when i heard Movies, I decided to buy the album.....yeah. Overall, I think the album is okay, and i definetly wasn't ""blown away"". I was hoping more of the album was like Movies, because I think it has a great sound; the rhythm is good, and the melody of Dryden's singing is excellent. The rest of the album is a little harder. (So, for all you hard rock fans out there, this album's for you!) Personally,I don't really care for the harder side of rock and roll...so, the album kind of turns me off at times."
3,I almost wanted to give it a 4 star rating.............but,"With a band such as this, you must be as completely objective as possible. I bought this CD just recently because of the song Smooth Criminal. That song is amazing and gives the band a definate fell of originality.Saying that, you then need to listen to the rest of the album. I was a little dissapointed, because I was always waiting for something better, but never got it. There are some good songs on this album other than Smooth Criminal.....like Movie, but the rest of the album just sounds the same. I do not regret buying this album, but I think everyone needs to be prepared not to be blown away.I am a college student and go to college in South Texas. Unlike alot of the people I live around, I do not enjoy the type of music most everyone else likes..(country, tejano). But even with that...and this band's ability to be something great....I only give it a 3 star rating."
3,a little unsatisfied with it...,"I was impresssed with thier first single ""Movies"" so after downloading the opener, ""courage,"" I went out and got this album. I must say that Im not all that impressed after hearing it. Musically, these guys are great, but Alien Ant farm leaves something to be desired withthier lyics. the wordplay nad puns in songs like ""Stranded"" and ""Summer"" get really irritating after a while, and the song ""Death Day"" is a complete waste of space on this album.There area good points on this album like ""Wish"" and ""Courage,"" but this needs some improvement in their songwriting. If you like this album though, Id reconmend ""greyest of blue skies"" by Finger Eleven. It's similar style, with better production."
4,Tight,Alient Ant Farm is off da hook. Smooth criminal is so tight!! I would reccomend this to rock lovers.Get this CD.
2,call the aNT EATERS,WHAT THE FUNK WHY REMAKE SMOOTH CRIMINAL DON' T MAKE MICHAEL LOOK STRANGER THAN HE ALREADY IS. GUYS LAY OFF THE PROZAC.
2,"Nope, nothing for me","Was on the aeroport and had really nothing to do because of a long wait. So I went to one of those stores and searched for some cool music to listen on my laptop...maybe even on the plane...so I picked up Alien Ant Farm, which there'd been lots of talking because of the song Smooth Criminal.Me as a heavy rock fan think this album is not listenable. Annoying chorus just make it impossible to like this album. Maybe it's something for people who like this kind of happy-rock music. In my opinion this album is very weak and cannot create anything that sounds good...maybe in the cover Smooth Criminal, but that's pretty much it."
2,"Smooth, But Not Smooth Enough",Alien Ant Farm! They're awesome right? Well I beg to differ. Although there cover of smooth criminal is some good music. The rest of the CD is well let's just say not good. Much of it is slow rock with a little zing. Anyway if you like smooth criminal buy the single and not this CD!
4,Alien Ant Farm has a promising start!,"Alien Ant Farm has incredible talent as a band. They sound kind of like Incubus and Papa Roach (Who the band has befriended). It's pretty hard stuff, but it's not depressing metal. They are another one of those bands that have been out for awhile and are now just finally starting to get noticed. The highlight of this album is actually the rock cover of Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal"", and any fan of Michael would be impressed about how good they sound performing it. The first single, Movies, is also pretty good. The vocals aren't anything spectacular, as the real talent is in the instruments. There are some great melodies and riffs here that you should not miss. Some of the slow songs are great here too. If you like Incubus, get this. Even if you don't normally like rock, still give this a try, as this is a great CD for the genre, and hopefully these guys will achieve some big success."
4,"Great, but more morbid than you'd think","Let me begin by saying that I love ""ANThology"", and think it's one of the best albums of the year.With that out of the way, one needs to be aware that the content of these songs is a lot more depressing than ""Smooth Criminal"" and the band's antics would lead you to believe. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but when you realize that their two singles (""Movies"" and ""Smooth Criminal""), which about breaking up and a grisly murder, respectively, are the two most upbeat songs on the album, one can easily imagine feeling uneasy about the rest of the songs. In fact, the best song, ""Death Day"" combines breaking up with a grisly death and still manages to include morbid humor (i.e., ""Papa's got a brand new BODY bag"").All in all, ""ANThology"" is a great album, but you may need to listen to it several times before you get used to the mood."
4,"Good, but should have been better!","I've only just got aaf, and some songs are so cool like 'Attitude''Smooth criminal' and 'Happy death day' but i did think the album as a whole would be a lot better! Alot of the songs sound the same and I know AAF could do alot better. I also have to say I think the lead singer DRYDEN MITCHELL has such a cool voice and is HOTT!!!"
4,It's okay ?,Well I liked this CD but they try to act and sing like Linkin park and limp bizkit so it's okay .
1,Save your cash,"AAF does a great knock off of ""Smooth Criminal"", but that's it. I went out on a limb and bought this disc hoping for more rocking tunes. WRONG, the rest of this CD, AAF's own material, is depressing [and] whiny ... This is easily the WORST album I have ever heard. These guys had better not quit their day jobs. Sad."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRING,"what else can i say about this cd except that it bores me out of my skull. i picked up a copy when i was buying one for my friend to see what it was like. well i liked it for a little while, but then i realized how mediocre the songs were. after a while it became the cd i always skipped automatically when looking for one to listen to. dont buy it unless u want something to sleep to (and u can get good music u can sleep to like sigur ros)."
4,Aliens play good music,"This was the first album I ever bought and it was great. Just like I heard it on MTV that Summer. My favorite song is the re-make of Michael Jackson's ""SMOOTH CRIMINAL"". It has a mix of songs rocking, and slower, more melodic tunes so it can satisfy anyones musical palette who like rock."
2,"It's round, shiney and plays...music???","I've had this cd for a while, I have listened to it a few times through...a few of the songs are stand out, but not really worthy of holding on too. Get this cd if you like shallow punk rock!"
5,a well tested album...,"AAF's first single fully launched after ""Smooth Criminal"" but their current single ""Attitude"" really shows AAF's versatility as fun, humorous guys who are also able to show a serious, mellow rock side to them. ""Attitude"" has an awesome percussive line, and their videos are always fun and entertaining. These guys also aren't afraid to do things for their fans, a thing that major rock bands rarely do. Overall, AAF is an awesome rock band that does more than playing heavy chords."
2,Alien Ant Farm is a big mess.,"First off, I don't like this album cause it's too messed up. Don't get it if u don't like that sorta thing. I only like 3 things on here and they're not really that messed up. They're much better. I don't recommend it."
3,Fun...poppy...whatever,"This is neither the best nor the worst album you'll ever come across. If you're not in the mood for more Blink 182 style pop-punk than you're going to want to skip this one for sure. The cover of Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal isn't worth the entire CD (stick with the single or MP3). If you like what you've seen on MTV, then you'll probably enjoy the rest of the album. Don't expect the rest of the album to be as high energy and even as hard as Smooth Criminal was (not that Smooth Criminal was terribly hard hitting either)"
4,Great Band!,"This album has been in my CD player for a couple of months now. It is probably one of the best I've ever purchased. They have songs that encompass all of your moods in one. It's good for guys and girls. Heavy enough for guys, meaningful enough for girls!Everyone should buy this record, but let it be known that all of the ANThology albums contain the bonus track called Apples and Oranges. In fact its one of my favorite songs on the record!"
1,why rock is dead. almost.,"have a cell phone? baggy pants? a dumb haircut? consider yourself ""cutting edge,"" ""controversial,"" or ""hardcore""? Then by all means, rush out to (...) and snap up this wonderful, wonderful album. Play it loud in your dad's car and show the world your anti-establishment, devil-may-care raison d'etre. Man, you couldn't care less about Brittany, right? You're gonna run out and get that tatt and/or pierced septum, right? Then you are a true original, pardner, and THIS is your soundtrack! It's like God read your mind and sent AAF to set thy free of the chains that lame-butt society forged to ensnare you!Trust me, one day after you are grown up, you will look back at this and laugh - albeit uncomfortably."
3,Stick n Stone!!,"The reason i gave this album 3 stars is because i only liked 3 songs.Standard - Because it was really cool with nice guitar riffs, and a cool chorus. They should have release this as a single instead of Movies, which was a really lame song.Stick and Stone - Best song on the album people dont appreciate this song that much but after the 2nd u listen to the song it will stuck in your head for good because it is so catchy much more catchy then smooth criminal even though this song doesnt make much sense.Smooth Criminal - Good song, catchy but after the 3rd time you get really sick of it,i know i got sick of it after the 3rd time.As for the rest of the cd it suck some songs have there moments such as the beginning of Whisper but other then that the cd isnt all that good. by the way the last track SUCKS!(...)"
2,"A couple good songs, but gets old fast","Personally, I haven't listened to much Alien Ant Farm other than this cd. I usually buy cds for a band or a few songs I like and then I listen to the whole cd. There are bands that I would call ""talented"" and other bands that are just ""One-Hit Wonders"". Alien Ant Farm might be a one-hit wonder. Smooth Criminal is a good song, and addictive, but eventually it gets boring. The first song on the cd, Courage, is also a good song. I like listening to both, but otherwise this cd isn't that great."
3,Ants music,"There's really something in their music: something from Papa Roach, something from probably even Eve 6, something from nu-metal, and some things - from something very poppy and sweet.The slightly bigger problem is the guys rather lack the real stand-outs, the really catchy tunes that in seconds make you remember the melody and sing along.No wonder the real hit of theirs at the moment is Smooth Criminal, the great song (even when AAF sing it).In short, good music, but mostly for those who are deep into pop music."
1,"If you're one of those ""New Rock"" fans you'll love this","Wow, and people are calling this ""rock?"" Christ, it's not even that hard. I mean, they cover a damn Michael Jackson song, this isn't rock it's just some bad music.The song Smooth Criminal is catchy of course, but a lot of songs are. I don't understand what happened here, we went from people like Hendrix, Albert King, and The Who to A.A.F, Papa Roach, and Limp Bizkit.Christ, I'm a huge music fan so I go out and buy as much music as my budget will let me, and this is one of those albums I end up selling or throwing far, far away.Terrible music, not recommended at all."
3,Average band,"At the moment I'm listening to a lot of bands coming out from the States,but AAF are one of the worst ""new sensation"" unfortunately.This album doesn't have an horrible sound or something like that,it is simply mediocre.I can mention only three songs that I really like: ""Movies"" power-pop,""Death day"" ballad,""Smooth criminal"" cover.The rest of album is a funk/grunge/nu-metal assembly that reminds me a little of incubus,another band that I don't like very much moreover."
2,Smooth Criminal only hit sorry...,"It hurts me to give a group with such potenial 2 stars. The only track worth listening to is their rendition of ""smooth criminal"" and maybe the track ""Movies"" But this C.D was poorly organized and the sound quality is horrifying might as well just download smooth Criminal on press play just leave this album alone"
2,Not Good :(,"O.k Alien at farm released their first single Smooth Criminal this song was great and then i heard another one of their tracks ""wish"" on Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 and i also thought that this track was great too and then finally they released movies this track also was superb so i decided too by the album ANThology and i was soooooo dissapointed if you by this album you will no what i mean. The songs arent bad but they are just soooooo forgetable and boring if you want my advice i would by some propper metal such as slipknot or cradle of filth. Oh yeah i did forget too mention there are 2 other tracks on this album that are good and thats corauge and death day these tracks are ok and not as forgetable but beleive me once you have listened to this album you'll but it back on your shelf and never pick it up again. But it is not so bad that you will never listen too it if you are a true fan then you will adore this disk but i am afraid that it is just not for me ;)."
4,A Very Good Record,"Alien Ant Farm are one of those bands that are kind of that guilty pleasure that a lot of people don't want to admit, but i will admit it for them. This record is good. Album opener COURAGE is a sound that defines what this band is about. All the songs range from poppy rock to some light metal. Tracks like WISH and STICKS AND STONES are good examples. But the only song(s) that i thought denied it 5 Stars was the song UNIVERSE. I thought it wasn't that good, and the hidden track wasn't that good either.(OOPS i was supposed to say there was a hidden track.) Anyway, this is a pretty well rounded record, i recommend this record to fans of bands such as hoobastank and trapt, but that is pretty much it and I hope this review has helped you out on how you view this record. GOOD LISTENING AND ROCK ON!!!"
4,AAF is something you want to look into,AAF's smooth criminal is nothing at all like the cd. I bought the cd because i fell in love with the song MOVIES. its the best song on the album. most of the songs are slow like movies but they have a great background beat. however i prefer to watch the videos of AAF for a few reasons 1 they are very entertaining and 2 dryden the lead singer is not to bad to look at. i absolutely love is haircut (for those who dont know he has a shaved line from the middle of his forhead back) but anyway back to the music. its very enlightening. its a great background music to read to or do homework because it doesnt distract you. and besides that its got great sound. AAF rules!
4,Smooth Criminal,"Smooth Criminal was the first song that i had heard by Alien Ant Farm, and because the single wasnt released yet, i had to buy the album, and i love it. With tracks like Smooth Criminal, Stranded, Flesh And Bone, Whisper and Attitude, this is a top album that should be bought by everyone"
4,Umm..are most reviewers of this album DEAF?,"There's a little story behind me buying ANThology: we were supposed to play a New Years gig, and we decided to cover AAF's version of ""Smooth Criminal"". I'm not really...what's that term...nu-rock? fan...maybe coz I'm 26....but AAF is beyond the rest of the below-average musicians on the scene. Once I did buy the CD, I got hooked to ""Attitude"": there are some reviewers on the forum who seem to think that the track shouldn't have been the single instead of ""Sticks and Stones"": I fail to understand why! Even leaving the congas out..(which are played by Alex Acuna's son on ""Attitude"", btw, and the cat is tasty.), Mike Cosgrove grooves out a killer on that track. I, for one, haven't seen too many drummers belt out a six-eight with so succinct ghost notes, and some really amazing tom fills and splashwork, without being too busy. Even without that, the guitar riff is addictive enough. Are people REALLY listening?"
1,AAF Pure Utter BULL,I heard the song Smooth Criminsl on the radio and thought it was a good and very catchy song so I been a big Rock Music fan . When I got the C.D i listened to the first song Courage which mistakingly gave me an impression this was going to be a good album. But then the other songs are rubbish such as Movies and are boaring tunes with even worse lyrics Keep Away from this and buy Blink 182 or Puddle of Mudd
3,Not as mind-numbing as I expected.,"When I first heard of Alien Ant Farm, it was through the Papa Roach relationship and I thought ""Oh God, not another one."" Even when I heard the first single ""Movies"" I wasn't impressed. But after finding this in a local record store ..., I decided to give it a fair chance, and I'm glad I did. This CD isn't half as bad as I had initially anticipated. Alien Ant Farm cleverly use elements of modern punk with rap-metal and pull it convincingly enough off. ""Courage"" is probably my favorite from the whole album. There are a few downsides though. Most of the songs sound too much alike and Dryden's voice can really irritate you. Not to mention that a lot of songs are derivative of a lot of current bands that aren't even worth half a listen. But all in all a fair album. Give it a try."
4,Great,"Alien Ant Farm is amazing, one of the best groups in this category. Their sound is a little similar to Incubus, mixed with Smashing Pumpkins. Sort of. If you like any sort of rock, get this CD. The only reason the CD didn't get 5 stars is that some of the lyrics seem a little odd to me, but other than that this group is perfect."
1,A A F rocks,"ANThology by alien ant farm is a sweet album.My favorite songs are Wish, Attitude, and Sticks and stones. This album is great, the guitar and bass are aggressive without being sloppy. The drums are tight too. But best of all, Dryden actually sings, he doesn't rap or scream like many other new bands. You should go pick up ANThology today."
1,horrible,"Most one hit wonders at least have enough talent to write the song that gets them noticed. AAF on the other hand copied of all people Michael Jackson, which should tell you something."
1,hello!,"why is smooth criminal so good? have you asked yourselves that? CAUSE ITS A MICHAEL JACKSON SONG FROM 1987's BAD ALBUM and the original is so much better! I'm only giving this one star cause I love smooth criminal, but it's the original I love, go buy Bad"
1,ALIEN ANT FARM SUCKS BEYOND WORDS,"(...) THEY HAVE TO BE BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST TALENTLESS REJECTS ON THE MUSIC SCENE TODAY. (...) THESE PEOPLE ARE IN DIER NEED OF A SERIOUS WAKE UP CALL. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, ENERGY, OR GAS TO RUN OUT AND GET THIS UNLESS YOUR A TOTAL LOSER THAT LIKES A BUNCH OF GUYS WITH NO RHYTHM WHAT SO EVER THAT DANCE AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF RABID MONKEY'S. I DONT KNOW ANY OF THE BAND MEMBERS NAMES BUT I DO KNOW THEY ACT LIKE TOTAL IDIOTS IN EVERY SINGLE VIDEO THEY MAKE. AND NOT TO MENTION HOW LOW BUDGET HE VIDEOS ARE....C'MON PEOPLE FOR GOD SAKES. ANYWAY UNLESS YOUR ONE OF THESE BUMBLING IDIOT/COMPUTER NERDS THAT SIT ON THE COMPUTER 22 HOURS OUT OF THE DAY AND SLEEP THE OTHER 2 THEN DONT GET THIS, IF I HAD TO LISTEN TO THIS CD AGAIN ID SERIOUSLY LOOK FOR SOME TYPE OF OBJECT TO SLIT MY WRIST OR MY THROAT WITH. THIS (...) IS PURE TORTURE!!!!!"
3,Good CD from a good band,"Alien ant farm is a band that's sort of hard to explain what their music is. All of their songs are rock, but what kind of rock? That's a hard question. I would have to go with punk because that's the closest style that I could compare to them, even though they aren't exactly punk like Green Day is punk.This cd is a lot of fun, but it seemed a few songs lacked feeling and were just put on the cd to take up space, but otherwise, most of the stuff was great. The best songs are Movies, which is all about what happens in movies (this song has a great video). Another good song is Smooth Criminal, which is a remake of an old Michael Jackson song. At least this time the song was improved and made by a sane group of artists..."
3,repetitive effort,"Alien Ant Farm will forever be known as the guys who've done smooth criminal, and unfortuneately, that is all that they deserve. their cd, though it shows some signs of talent, is inconsistent in quality and repetitve through the lyrics and voice of the lead singer. everyone told me how great of a cd this is...but it is hardly one you could listen to all the way through.however, don't get me wrong, there are some great tracks on here. ""courage"" is one of my favorite rock songs right now with a catchy chorus. movies and smooth criminal are the singles and arguably two of the better songs on the album. wish is a fast-paced song with a passionate guitar and vocals.songs to avoid: flesh and bone, summer, calico, universebottom line: get a couple songs and put them on a mix"
5,WOW,This one of my favorite cd's. Alien Ant Farm doesnt have offensive lanuage. The guitarists are excellent. Smother Criminal is awsome. I would recoment this cd to anyone!
5,You know...........,"people need to buy CD's NOT just because they're popular, but because they're good. First of all smooth criminal is not near the best song on this cd(actually I skip it most of the time)Movies was their first single...Anyone remember the video with King Kong and stuff? The re-released it after Smooth Criminal went big. Movies is alright too, but dont buy this cd because of those songs thinking the rest is like those songs.Buy this Cd becuase it's REALLY good. Oh and death day is not about killing someone, it's about wishing someone was dead because they hurt you bad and feeling what it would be like if they did die......"
4,You've been Stuck by...A Smooth...Cover Band?,"To think that less than a year ago, this band couldn't even get on VH1! (No offense). Alien Ant Farm, band created by One-hit wonders Papa Roach (sorry Roach fans, but it's true). The Beginning song is start out of screaming and theband almost seems identical to Incubus and Papa Roach theselves! ""Smooth Criminal"", the band first hit single (and with no hope, their only hit single) is a cover off Micheal Jackson's 1988 ""Moonwalker"" movie soundtrack. And I must say, they do a pretty good job of making a 80's pop song into a nice Grunge version...wel, maybe not grunge. Very impressive. Let's just hope they stick around enough...at least longer than their Mentor"
2,We are a mainstream rock band look at us we are selling cd's,"That is what AAF must be saying to themselves right about now. This band came from the same scene that papa roach did and are being put on Papa Roach's label. This album i think is a good one, but all in all, it sounds like it is too sugar-coated. The production is excellent, every sound the band makes is crystal clear, the bass especially. Anyone into mainstream rock would like this cd, although i would not reccommend it to anyone else!"
5,Alien Ant Farm,Its believeable how awesome this band is! I keep on calling 1-800-dial-mtv and voting for them on TRL and its working!!!!! They are #9 on the countdown!! This CD is awesome and is a must have!!!!!Got it?
4,a good slice of blakey,"some critics have panned this 1961 session by mr. blakey and the jazz messengers, feeling the album lacks the punch of such classic blakey lp's like 'moanin' or 'a night in tunisia' (blue note records version). this set is more laid-back, for a blakey band, emphasizing groove over hardbop fury. but that is not to say this album is not good, though. mr. blakey had a gift for bringing together great bands of young musicians and forging a solid unit out of them. this version featured the outstanding horns of lee morgan (trumpet), wayne shorter (tenor sax), and curtis fuller (trombone). mr. morgan takes a quiet approach to his soloing (eg., ""don't you know what love is"") and is wonderful. mr. shorter gives us glimpses of things to come on his own blue note sessions (eg., 'juju' and 'night dreamer'). other highlights are the opening ""alamode"" and ""i hear a rhapsody"". for a nice introduction to mr. blakey, or to hear a more groove oriented messengers set, try this album."
3,Great for older 775s,"Plenty of features including RAID, hyperthreading, digital audio and gigabit lan, but don't expect to use it on a Pentium D or Duo. It is 04a marked processor compliant ONLY."
5,Kundalini Awakening for Personal Mastery,"Execelente! Originally I was just searching for a ""simple"" way to learn how to meditate and this book got my attention. Mr. Morgen your simple, easy and down to earth steps teached me much more than just meditation. I have recommended this book to my friends already."
1,"Terrible writing, poor insight.","If I had known that this book quotes ""The Secret"" multiple times I wouldn't have given any thought to purchasing it. I bought this book hoping to acquire some knowledge of Kundalini, but the author doesn't seem to have much knowledge beyond what he read in a few books. He simply lacks intelligent things to say. Hence the quoting of ""The Secret."" I'll see what else I can find on Kundalini."
1,Review,A dangerous book.Kundalini power can be compared with lightning.Chakras nuclear bombs.Those who want genuine kundalini info should read gopi krishna and muktanandas autobiographies.Anyone who promises easy enlightenment and mastery is lying and dangerous
5,Slick Old School,"Ive always wanted a pair of Lavers but never purchased them. Im really glad amazob had them so cheap! I couldnt refuse the deal! Great, stylish, lightweight, comfortable and downright slick shoe!!!"
1,Adidas Rod Laver Tennis Shoe,Shoe hurts my feet!!! Poorly constructured leather and it's not going to break in - I wore the shoe and don't think I can return.
5,bring back shoes that always look good,It's great that adidias has brought back all the old styles from the 70s & 80s when sneakers were sneakers.great fit and will last a year at least.
5,Great shoe,I recently bought a pair of Rod Laver tennis shoes and I have nothing but good things to say. The shoes look great and are quite comfortable. They came to my house around 4 days after ordering them.
3,Not Bad but the size smaller than what I expect,"I used to wear number 9 shoes, but this one is smaller than I expected. If you wear number 9 shoes, you should order a 9.5 for this one."
3,Great Classic Shoe,"I was looking for a good tennis shoe. I thought I would search on classic tennis shoes and found these. I used to use these tennis shoes in the 80's when I played HS tennis and liked them, so I ordered a pair. When they arrived, it was like a reunion of old friends. They felt great and very comfortable out of the box. They fit surprising well because of my wide feet. They had no (or very little) breakin. They were great on the court (hard court). After a couple of months of use, the only ding (and reason for 3 stars) is that soles haven't lasted as long as I hoped. The toe drag area has pretty much worn complete through."
2,Alright I suppose,"The shoe is OK, except for the fact that it feels like a toy. The shoe is completely made of plastic- including the sole. The sole does not bend well and as a result the shoe is not that comfortable. Adidas seemed to cut a few corners here...."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought these were leather, but they are made out of some type of mesh material. But he like them so I guess that's all that matters."
4,One of the Best Original,"I've worn this since the '70s when they were ""In"". I guess a lot of shoes are making a come back. These were the original ""gel"" like comfort shoes. When I was playing tennis, these were my favorite, along with Converse worn by Jimmy Connors. Nowadays, people throw their sneakers in the wash when it needs cleaning. Back then we hose spray ours and leave to dry. For the price, you can't beat this one. Also, try Puma Clyde/Suede, one of my favorites. One other pair I'm looking at right now is the Adidas Country-not the Country II. But you can't go wrong with the Rod Laver."
2,Not like the original,"I used to wear these shoes for high school tennis over 25 years ago. I bought a pair recently and they are not the same comfort or quality as the original. They are extremely stiff, no support, and they give me blisters. The do look good (if you like that classic look)."
4,classic shoe,youll have a hard time finding this shoe in stores. i just wish they had more colors. great shoe!!!
5,Rod Lavers,Great shoe that fits nicely. It matches the size that it is supposed to be (at least for size 12). I have no problems with this shoe and wear it everyday; this is my third pair as well.
1,Major Disappointment!!!,"Very comfortable. Just what I was looking for. Fast forward 1 month, the soles wore out! There is an actual hole in the sole. I'm so glad I bought them from Amazon. I won't have to fight for a refund. I'll buy a different type(from Amazon) hopefully better quality. Oh by the way, I'm not a tennis pro. I'm a retired senior."
2,Shame for those soles,"I got this great sneaker shoes from Amazon, but the sole is really bad quality, it is like plastic, very slippery, I would like to have better quality, can someone help me."
1,Very uncomfortable,The shoe looks great and is really light BUT I found it was extremely uncomfortable around the toe area where the seam between the side and front panel is. I wore them for two days hoping they would break in but no such luck. It's a shame because I was expecting more from adidas and I really like the design of these shoes.
2,Stiff and tight,"These shoes look great but offer little in the way of comfort for the price. Very little padding and a snug fit, rough edges inside the shoe. I've gotten my share of blisters trying to break them in. I bought my usual size and they are a very snug fit, you may need to order 1/2 to a full size larger in these"
3,"Comfy, not long lasting....",The shoes were great and very comfortable. Good on the court and amazing for everyday use. But after only a few months of use the part of the shoe that should be covering my left toe is completely exposed. These aren't the most durable pair of shoes you could get....
3,Comfort and fit,The Rod Laver is a good fit in length heel and toe. The problem I am having with flat feet is the inner arch build in shoe. The use of a pad sofar is cardboard. This smoothes out the fit and comfort. The other thing to be sure of is the heel arc on rear soles. The angle may be more than I need for left outer heels plant first and hardest on walking. Once this is determined I can be sure of how well this shoe is going to turn out. It looks good is uneventful in control and plant nice style. The simpler construction over the New Balance and classic looks are welcome. Watch the inner arch pad if you are flat footed as I am. Will in my case need to smooth out the inner arch to my foot contures.
4,Updated already but not enough,"In this edition, the author mentions to WTO and its influence on foreign investment. It would be better if the change in this area be explored more."
5,Beauty of a saw,"I purchased this saw to replace a very old makita chop saw, and I couldn't be happier. UPS did a horrible job shipping it, so it wasn't dead on accurate, but pretty close. I am very happy with it, and would suggest it to anyone in the market for such a saw. Worth the money, and worth having FedEx ship it."
2,Wish I hadn't spent the money,"I was excited about this saw when it first arrived, and it worked well until the warranty expired. When it went out of square, the autorized repair shop, with direction from Bosch, quoted over $350 to fix and said even that might not do it. They said it had been dropped or run over by a truck, both of which would be difficult since the saw had been on a stand since it was new. The shop recommended the Makita which surprisingly is made in America. I won't be looking to Bosch for quality equipment."
5,great saw.,"like all the rest reviewers, this saw is hands down the finest saw on the planet. crown moulding is a piece of cake now, as is all other cuts from fine trim to 6x this work horse takes it all. And, my nephew works for Skill/Bosch and I got this one for $250.00 new in the box!How cool is that!"
1,sucky saw,"let me begin by saying that i have many bosch tools, and that they all perform very well. however, the miter saw in question is the worst that i have ever used. i am a professional trim carpenter in the tahoe area. in short the saw is over engineered. too many moving parts make for innacurate cuts."
1,Bad!!,"Don't waste your money on this cd. It's missing a lot. For example is missing ""Get it While it's Hot."""
3,Too Bad,"Take a careful look at this album photo. This was once a band that had a sense of humor. I saw them many times, in a tiny club in the boonies of Maryland when they were starting out. They were fun to see and very good at what they did. The problem was, like with many bands, they started to cop themselves. The sound got repetitive on later albums and the fun--and smiles--were gone. Too bad."
1,Are ya kidding me????,"????? no 'cold shower'????? no 'ring around rosie'???? this is anything BUT 'essential'!....lie like a rug, baby...."
1,Awful,This CD was the worst waste of money. The music is just plain AWFUL. The background music was tolerable but the singers voice was horrible.Please don't waste your money!!
5,A rare gem,"Sometimes you listen to a piece of music for the first time and it strikes you that it sounds so original yet so logical, so beautiful and natural yet so rare. This is how this music struck me when I first heard it in LP 20+ years ago. Is a recording for the ages. When the trombones come in out of nowhere in ""La nevada"" you feel taken by them, yet you feel like there is nothing else that could have come in but these bones. ""Where Flamingos Fly"" is a masterpiece of arranging and shows the artistry of Jimmy Knepper. The session continues with one beautiful surprise after another. Do yourself a favor and get this recording if is the only one you can get."
5,CLasssic,"I love music of great harmonic complexity, but equal is the case for stripping to the essentials: using few chords and letting the musicians workGil Evan's does this on Out Of The Cool. The music here has bare bones structure: much of this is blues derived, but player's like Jim Hall on guitar and trumpet man John Coles do amazing work here.Listen to how this music swings, breezing by as each musician makes a subtle contribution. Often they overlap, but Evans keeps the canvas so flexible, so flickering, the musicians work off one another, not against one another.All this sounds a little academic, but academic does not mean detacted: Evans is neither ripping guts or pulling heart strings. He wants, and gets, all the little nuances ticking. Like a clock, once you hear it, you can't stop. But in this case you'll never want to.I got this on ABC Impulse glossy gatefold, solid orange spine and all. 1961 A-4 in Mono. Eat your heart out"
2,Woman without much talent,"Why didn't I like it? Her character development was incomplete. Her characters were very transparent and did not change much throughout this ""thriller/mystery"". The plot, although creative, did not seem very realistic. I know it's only fiction, but, even the end was not all that it was built up to be. You'll wait and wait for an exciting ending and not get one. Her discriptions of things/events was on par with that of a real writer, but the rest of it seemed like anyone with an interest in creative writing could have written it."
2,Mathematics meets mechanics,"Once upon a time, before technology referred to all things computer and IT, it referred to mechanisms and the ""hands on"" side of how things worked. That's what this book focuses on. The book should be called ""Mathematics Meets Mechanical Technology"" since it focuses on solving mechanical problems involving gears, levers, pulleys, linkages, movement and mechanical transmission of power. This book was one of many on a graduate mathematics reading list which is why I chose it. It uses math but is not mathematical. Nothing beyond high school math (algebra, geometry (not the proofs), and trigonometry) is required. If you are a hobbyist, like to build mechanical devices, want to supplement a kinematics discussion in physics or applied math, or studying engineering then this book is useful. I don't think this is useful for someone who is only interested in ""pure"" math. It is not a casual read as it focuses on problem solving."
5,Jazz with a Middle Eastern Flavor,"Being a fan of world music and one-time Arabic scholar, I particularly enjoy the exotic flavor and rhythms in a couple of the songs, namely, ""The Seven Principles"", ""Three Wise Men"", and ""The Sage"". Since Ellington can do very little wrong, in my book, I also very much like ""Melancholia"". ""Chappaquitic Woman"" is darkly haunting for me in its evocation of swirling waters, recalling, of course, the tragedy and scandal at that river. ""Divine Paradox"" and its sister, ""The Divine Paradox"", are also aqueous, but in a more soothing way, with a sound like waves lapping in a Virginia Woolf book. All in all, this is a great CD which I can't recommend highly enough. I've had it for over a year and I listen to it with a new ear every time."
4,Something I noticed,"Well, I haven't heard it, but I think it's good because Symphony X is just awesome!But, this is what I noticed: ""Sevil Alucard"" is backwards ""Dracula Lives"". Could this be related someway to old video-game Castlevania? Hmm, interesting..."
4,The roots of Symphony X,"this is a good instrumental CD. Romeo has got excellent chops and he shows it well here. Instrumental guitar fan should love this, if their into the technical side of instrumentals. Not near as good as Symphony X's ""Divine Wings Of Tragedy"" or ""V - The New Mythology Suite"" but still an excellent release considering it was Romeo's first. I would say this CD is like symphony X but with more technical guitar runs. The songwriting isn't up to par with symph X, although songs 2, 5, and 9 are great songs. Fans of Symph X should check this out!"
4,A stunning masterpiece for instrumental fans...,"While the drum machine may feel a little stiff.. or mechanical even, little fault can be found in the elegant guitar riffing of Symphony X neo-classical influenced axeslinger, Michael Romeo. His interpretations of classical music set to the electrifying beauty of the guitar are well pieced together and performed amazingly. There is plenty of life left in these classics and the modern metallic updates are amazing. Instrumental fans will be more than just pleased with this album, and those familiar with SyX will find this to be an essential part of their collection."
2,I expected more of this man,"Having read the reviews before me, I expected a lot more - excellent speed & accuracy & killer technique in general. To be sincere, I must admit the guy is technically quite proficient, but by no means I am on my knees. His style is generally quite boring - borrows too much from Cacophony, etc. Ingenuity is simply lacking here. If you are in for axe wielders, there are far better choices out there, with more catchy melodies, intriguing chops and more interesting compositions. I wanted my brain to be blown away - nothing like that happened."
3,"Ehhh, well is nice, buy not awesome","Michael Romeo is one of the best metal guitar players, but this album is not one of his best efforts. It sounds like the soundtrack for a Castlevania game. Don't get me wrong is a nice album, but I was expecting a masterpiece from this guy. Any fan of Symphony X will enjoy it."
1,The same as its sequel...,"Well...this was not at all what I expected. Maybe I was confused. I was hoping to see a bunch of half dressed, gorgeous women dancing in ways that are barely legal in most foreign countries. What I got was a bunch of low quality recording reggea videos that I could have downloaded myself for much less money and in much higher quality. It does have great cover art though. That had to be the highlight of the purchase. Don't waste your money as I did."
3,A little weaker than the last but still good,"Brian Mcknight returned with his sixth CD titled Superheo. The CD features more of the quiet storm balladary Mcknight is known for, however on this CD it begins to drag a little bit. The first single Love Of My Life may be one of the strongest songs, Brian has ever recorded vocally. Love Of My Life"" is sung entirely in falsetto and he hits an E5; which is beyond the range of most tenors.) The transition between his falsetto and head voice is also smoother than most singer's in the game. The other two standout songs were My Kinda Girl feat. Justin Timberlake and What's Gonna Be. My Kinda Girl had Justin & Brian doing an excllent tag team R&B duet while What's Gonna Be gave us a smooth jazz cafe type feel. This wasn't Mcknight's best,however it is one of the weakest in his catlog."
4,"MOST PRODUCTION, QUITE RUSH, BUT STILL, BRIAN MCKNIGHT","Brian is back!!! but maybe too soon. I like this album, I enjoy the songs, still I find Mcknight's writing.But when I listen to it, each time I play this CD just a word come to my head: RUSH. Too soon, or better, hasty. As I've said I think this CD is good, but worst than brian's last one, and I truly think Mcknight lost a great opportunity to do the BEST, to give out his BEST, to join perfect art and perfect production on it. Anyway, he still have time , and surely he will, cause he knows how to do it. Listen to Crazy Over You, it's just a perfect example!!!."
5,He's topped Back at One!,"I didn't think he could do it, but the talented Mr.McKnight has created beautiful melodies once again. There are many songs on this track that have #1 single written all over it. The song ""Superhero"" was a little different, but has grown on me, as the others have. ""Still"" just takes ones breath away and ""When you Wanna Come"" gives you that down and sensual feeling on Brian can deliver with class. If you like R & B but can do without the heavy urban/ghetto sound--grab some Brain!!!!"
4,Trust this one...it's the R'n'B we've needed,"In the past few years, the smooth R'n'B genre has suffered major blows, with the decline of Boyz II Men, the absence of Babyface, the thuggery of R.Kelly, and the hit and miss of almost every other group. However, Brian McKnight has found his niche. He sings from the heart, his songs sound passionate, and his lyrics at least bother to relate to real life. This album is what I've personally been waiting for- something slow and meaningful to listen to. It's also everything I didn't get from Boyz II Men's last attempt, R. Kelly's downward spiral into thug life, Babyface's terrible new album, and K-Ci and JoJo's one hit albums. Trust me on this one; it will satisfy your love song needs."
2,Hate To Break It To Ya...,"This is not Brian McKnight's best work, in my opinion. Granted, there are some great tracks here (When Will I See You Again, with Fred Hammond and Love of My Life), but I was pretty disappointed! I expected, I suppose, material similar to that which was on his other cds. I just wasn't feeling him on this one. I look forward to his next one, as I'm still a fan."
2,Not His Best Effort,"I'm so disappointed.I'm a big fan of Brian McKnight, but this album doesn't say much. The best song on there is ""Love of My Life"", which is played on the radio. The rest of the album is a bunch of repetitious slow jams with little personality.Borrow someone else's before you buy it....."
5,Great CD,This is an excellent CD. I bought this as a replacement for one that was beyond repair from scratches. One of the songs on this CD will be played at our wedding.
3,what a talent!,"If I were you, I would hop a plane to Japan and pick up the import version of this wonderful album. It contains the duet with Jar Jar from the Star Wars sequel, and this song is just incredible. Jar Jar did the remix as well, which showcases Mcknight's mixing skills as well as flawless rap flow. If only the duet with David Hasselhoff would have been included on the import...ah, a man can dream, right? Dream about the days of yesteryear, when boyz to men still got played on the radio, and paula adbul had a record deal....well got to go...love, me"
2,Average,"Brain Mcknight has Talent but He is also trying to get His ""Can't Slow Down"" on.that was Lionel Richie's Big Cross-over Album.alot of the same trademarks are here as well.nothing really blows me away.what got Lionel Richie over however was His Ability to take chances&yet maintain His Own Idenity but McKnight allows His Influences to Overshadow Him a bit here.at least He tried something a bit different than His Last ALbum but I still Like His First Album far&Away Better than anything on a whole since."
1,Very stupid,My sister has this CD. We had to listen to it in the car and I hated it. It's not even R&B! Every song on it is a slow song. It's like GET OVER IT!!!!!
4,Spa treatment - as long as you dont move,"The slippers are soft, warm and when you follow the directions smell great. The microwaveable packets keep feet warm for about an hour. The only downside is you cannot walk in the slippers with the aroma packets inserted. They also don't seem to be sturdy enough for regular wear around the house. Even the package states that they are not walking slippers. That would have been nice to know before purchasing!"
2,Disappointed with Quality,"This is the 4th pair of the Happy Toes that I've owned, my family loves them and I was happy to find them instead of settling for a cheap substitute. However after the very first use, one of the outer seems became quickly unsewn, due to the location and material it is impossible to repair. I am very disappointed to say the least, the quality was unacceptable.I bought two pairs and the other was perfectly fine."
3,Gift to Grandma,"I bought these slippers for my mother who has chronic cold feet. The warmth is great, but like the other reviews have said you are unable to walk in them with the heat packs inside. If I'd known this I wouldn't have bought them. If you are sitting around they are very warm and last about an hour. For someone like my mother they are ok except she has to take them off before walking with her walker. I think they would be perfect if somehow they were made with the heat pack on the top and a hard sole on the bottom. I use to have a pair with a heated gel pack on the top and they worked very well, keeping my feet warm for along time even while walking. You might consider this and if you make this change I would be interested in a pair for myself.thank you"
2,Not as I imagined!,These slipper were very bulky & cloddy (?) and the smell from the lavender was not very pleasant at all.
2,Warm but Shoddy,"The slippers are comfortable and the filler is aromatic and warm. But the slippers were sewn so poorly that the filler began to fall out on both slippers. On the other hand, the item was cheap. I took the filler out and put it in place of another, more expensive pair."
2,Size Too Small,If you have small feet I guess they are OK. I have size 81/2 and no way can I get these on while wearing a pair of socks. Amazon should have explained that one size fits all means all under size 8.
1,Hard to use,"The shoes are warm as advertised, but since they look like boots, one would expect you to be able to wear them around the house. You can't. They keep slipping."
1,Poor quality. Soles break.,"I bought a pair for my wife, heated them up and she wore them onnce in bed. She never put any pressure on them other than pulling them over her skinny size 9 feet to put them on. Never took a single step with them. When she removed them, one had a torn seam and was un-fixable. I put a little pressure on the other slipper in the same spot and it easily separated as well. Amazon's return policy came through for me though. Thanks Amazon!So far, the Happy Company gloves and headband I bought seem fine though."
3,great product... poor service,"While I love this product, I was very disappointed when it arrived two weeks after Christmas. I ordered ""Happy Toes"" five weeks before Christmas(with 2-3 day shipping) and was guaranteed ""Holiday"" shipping. It arrived seven weeks later."
2,Happy Co. Makes Unhappy Customers,"I ordered these slippers as a gift. To my embarassment, the gift never arrived. I received an email stating that the slippers were backordered. Weeks later I received another email stating it would be an indefinite time before the product would be available. I just cancelled the order. I am defiitely an UN-Happy customer."
1,don't waste your money!!!,!!!the shirts came ripped and stained!!! do not waste your time and your money...poor quality!!the worst shopping experience!!!not recommended at all
5,Good price - no issues,I've been wearing these shirts for a few months now and the neck elastic on all of them are still in great shape. Can't complain about the price either - much cheaper on Amazon than in stores.
1,Kind of disappointed,Very thin tees - no better than the kind you'd get at Wal-Mart. Save your money.
2,Pretty thin material but useable,These shirts are okay if you are looking for some cheap undershirts. Other than that I wouldn't recommend them. The material is pretty thin and you really can't wear it on its own. The fit is okay but I wish they were a little longer in the torso area. If you are pretty tall they might be too short for you.
2,What a waste,These were the incredible shrinking t-shirts. With each washing they seemed to get smaller and smaller...and I know how to wash clothes. Just something about this brand...not worth buying unless you get them way bigger than you need to begin with.
3,hanes t-shirts,"the transaction was fine as is always the case when ordering through amazon. the one issue i have is that clearly hanes has very obviously cheapened their tshirts from wha they were years ago. they are very thin now. typical scenario...cheapen it, cut costs. so tired of this never-ending theme..."
1,Don't waste your money!,The fabric is to thin and it feels cheap. I'm not sure what's happened to this line of T-Shirts but the quality use to be much better. I recommend you try something else and don't waste your money on this!
2,dont waste your money,"Wack cd. Low quality producer/s and talent. except for about 2 or 3 artists (rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money. If you value your hard earned money then may i suggest ""Los Kambumbos"". it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj Jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including; trebol clan, khriz & angel, Nicky Jam, Tito el bambino and more."
5,22 years old and love this thing.,"i love this little thing i have sitting on my shelf that has cool stuff like bobble heads, statues, ect. Whenever a friend comes over and walks by the shelf some one always ends up hitting it."
5,Bulls*** Button,I bought these as gifts. The people loved them and their friends. People wanted to know where I got them. Yes I would recommend it.
2,Mediocre at best,"I was disappointed. Just didn't find it very funny, so I returned it. But I suppose it's a matter of opinion and to each his own."
1,"Weak case, lousy messages","The case is flimsy and there are no sticky feet to prevent it sliding off the desk when I slap it.Further, the messages are hackneyed and show very little creativity."
5,Best gag gift,It was the best Christmas gag gift I have ever given to the best brothet in law on Christmas Eve
1,Was for a friend,"I ordered this for a friend at work, was very disappointed. I still have it. I didn't give it to her for Christmas...still have it."
3,Xmas gift,This was a Xmas gag gift for my little brother. I believe it was a hit. I do hour he enjoys it. Gave a three only because it was a gag gift and not a toy.
4,BS Button Invaluable,Great office toy. Not really suitable for children. Everyone working in an office environment could appreciate this as a viable alternative to the Easy Button.
3,Really Small,So it's much smaller and differently colored than in the picture but the phrases are still fun and it makes a good gag gift.
5,customers love it,i sell this thru my personal storeright to the point. keep one on counterjust for people to play with
1,funny but battery issues,"Funny little toy. Great for conference calls.But, will not work when you try to put new batteries in, so it looks like it will only work as long as the original batteries hold up, at least in my case. Tried multiple replacemnents."
2,Arrived with broken package and shorted circuit,"The packaging arrived with cracked plastic and the battery was dead. I replaced the battery and wrapped it up (it was to be a stocking stuffer for christmas), and by the time it was unwrapped 2 days later, the brand new batteries were dead. I understand it's a cheap product, but c'mon... it should at least work for a week before breaking down.(The one or two lines I heard immediately after replacing the batteries were funny and my dad would have really gotten a kick out of the toy, if it had worked...)"
2,dead batteries,"I ordered 4 of these for Christmas gifts and when they arrived all the batteries were dead..buying the new batteries addedexpense to the gift..They are very cute and a great fun gift, but embarrassing to give a gift that does not work.."
5,Father's Day Gift,"This is a great gift for Father's Day or for a man's birthday. Some women would also appreciate it, but it is a neat gift for the man who has it all. The button randomly goes through different sayings each time you hit it. The sayings are very funny and make you laugh."
5,funny classic,its good its like a buzzer lol it came wit this thing so i can stick it to surfaces so place it anywhere n buzz it if u hear bs!!! o it comes with baterries too
5,I am a BS believer.,"Love this BS button. I put this on top of my PC which is on my desk, that way it is always ready when I need it. Very funny, just don't overdo it as it can be annoying. My other officemates want one too, but no can do. There should only one BS button in this workplace, and it shall be on my desk.Everything is made of plastic. The button is just a tad less than 3 inch in diameter. It shipped with batteries too.I can't believe I ordered this. But it turned out it's worth it :)Great gift idea."
3,"it's ok, wasn't expecting a lot","I thought it would just say ""bs"" - but it says a whole lot more - its funny, but i would've liked it better if it just simply said the word."
5,Awesome,"I am in b2b sales and have placed in this on my cube in the ""sales pit."" Everyone walks by and pushes it. Love this guy."
2,bulls*** meter,"It's a well made product that will last the user for a long long time, but this particular model wasn't among the best as far as the actual phrases it says are concerned."
5,good gag gift.,Good for a white elephant gift exchange among friends with a sense of humor who are not too easily offended.
4,Worked For Us,"I bought this as a Christmas present while my wife was away. I knew her cousin would enjoy it. The whole family actually thought this was funny as heck, and great match for her cousin's personality and work situation."
3,"Good gift, but not much else unless you like these kind of novelties.","As gag gifts go, this is a pretty okay item. Not too much to be excited about (least for me), but not bad either. It's louder than what I thought it would, so that's a plus. However, I was slightly surprised when I received it. The packaging is different and it's a bit smaller than it looks in the picture. Other than that, it's the same item. Would make a good gift to someone whom you don't know what to get and likes gag gifts/bull****."
3,"Somewhat interesting, nothing more","I also have the Staples Easy button. The BS button, even though it costs more, does not have the same build quality or tactile click feedback as the lower price Easy button. The BS button feels a bit flimsy, and a bit loose. The quality tactile feel of the Staples button gives more button-pressing satisfaction than this one. The words 'BS' is cheaply printed on the button, while on the Staples button, 'easy' is actually raised. Tip: the Staples button costs less if you buy it from a Staples store.The BS button lights up and gives a few simple phrases such as, ""This is 'BS'"", or, ""Warning, warning, 'BS' alert"" with sirens going off. It was a hit at first. Works great when you're with friends who are Staples employees, but outside of that it doesn't get much use as its humor wears off fast."
1,Battery came dead!!,"This was suppose to be a gag gift for a co-worker. Cheap, simple. Now I have to compromise the unopened box as a gift to buy and replace the batteries! Pathetic. Really. In fact, I'm so irritated about it I'm writing a review before I even hear if the gag sounds good."
2,Over rated,"I purchased a few of these for gag gifts and after receiving them thought they were monotonous. Not offensive, just monotonous. The Magic 8 Ball is more entertaining and funnier."
2,Not like the Staples button,"I was kind of expecting the same kind of thing that you get with the Staples ""That was easy!"" button but the stuff that comes out of this thing when you push the button isn't just ""BS"", it's a bunch of goofy/corny expressions."
5,Funny Little Thing,Bought this for my Dad for Christmas and he loved it. Really it's just there to be funny and it definitely serves its purpose. It also went over rather well as he loved the gift. :)
4,A button,This button says a couple of funny things. Great if your office environment is relaxed enough to stand cursing and could use a little laugh.
5,gadget hobbyist,"Make someones day...! I don't consider it a toy it's a.....work stress reliever! Too funny!! In no way would I call it educational, not for kids! It was a hit! My co-worker loved it and so did everyone else!"
5,Fun gift,Ordered this button for stocking stuffer for adult children. It was the favorite gift of the year.
5,The right message for the right time,Politicans are great for telling us what we need and how they are going to help us and that it won't hurt a bit. If you are at loss for words when watching C-SPAN or the evening news. Then your answer is here. I took it into my senator's office and used it when I was told how interested he was in my problems. No citizen today should be without one.
2,Not Happy with Purchase,"I was expecting the button like the ""Staples"" button to simply say the ""BS"" phrase when you hit it...this one talks in a Texas accent and says all of these different phrases that I guess is funny, but this is not what I wanted and was not stated that it would have all of the phrases in the review. Definitely will not be purchasing or recommending this to anyone. The only thing I could do with it was use it in a white elephant gift at Christmas."
3,small but to the point,It was a simple button that brought great pleasure. It had 4 lines that it circulated from. None just simply called out BS. The voice of the button kind of reminded me of a rodeo announcer.
3,"Surprisingly small, not a STAPLES button","Just a fair warning, if you think this thing is as big as a STAPLES button, you're mistaken. It's half the size. Fun, but half the size."
3,"Not as pictured or described...and beware, it makes sounds WHILE SHIPPING.","I ordered this for a friend as a gag gift. There are several problems with this order. First of all, the button is NOTHING like the one shown in the pictures OR DESCRIBED in the text. They describe it as lighting up and buzzing. It does neither. The phrases they list? It says none of them. The look of the item? Not even close.But that's not the worst part. They shipped it with the batteries in and ACTIVATED. And it was shipped in a flimsy package (not really a box). This meant that just touching the box pushed the button. I had this delivered to my OFFICE. It was saying BULLSHIT phrases over and over again as they brought it to my desk. I'm lucky I wasn't fired as we can't use that kind of language here.This seller really needs to be more careful and accurately describe the item. Also, do SOMETHING in shipping the keeps the button from playing."
3,Gets old fast,"This button has about 5 phrases. Each is different and said in a male voice. Voice sounds somewhat like a robotic, male voice shouting through a bull horn.It's somewhat funny. Does get old fiarly quick though. It's something you'd play with for 20 minutes and then give to a friend so they can have a good laugh and then passing it off to someone else as well.The price tag is reasonable for what you get. It's not an amazing purchase, but for the cost it's not a risky purchase."
4,Wouldn't really call it a toy...,I bought this for our military office. It is quite hilarious. We press it everytime someone needs a BS call. It does a few different sayings and everyone has begun to use it. It's a lot of fun.
1,Product doesn't work,"This was an absolute waste of money. It didn't work, so it was basically a plastic button. This was worthless junk."
3,Gimmicky bulls*** button,"The button is pretty cheap, the phrases are not that funny, but it entertains the coworkers. It's a cute gimmick and not very expensive."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this button thinking it was the same one as the one in the picture which is the one I've seen before. When it arrived, the button looks somewhat different and the phrases are not as funny as the ones from the button shown in the picture."
5,Bully for this gift!,"The perfect gift for someone with an ""off-the-wall"" sense of humor. Loved it so much I didn't want to give it away!"
5,Very popular at work!,"What can I say purchased this as a gift, it was well liked by the recipient! Very popular at work and brought a lot of laughs!!"
5,Hysterical! When there's nothing else to say ...,A super fun gift for the friend who has everything! Even the dog can press the BS button ... a total riot!
2,No Fun,"While Riccardo Muti may be one of the premier Verdi conductors in the world today, the effervesence of this light Donizetti comedy almost completely eludes him. The score under his baton becomes quite leaden. He is not helped by the cast; Mirella Freni was past Norina at this point in her career and she wisely avoids high notes even though she does try to exhibit some of the character's personality. Gosta Winbergh is adequate as Ernesto while Leo Nucci's Malatesta tries to bring some life to the proceedings. Sesto Bruscantini is a surprise - his Pasquale is heavy-handed and lumbering: a definite comedown from his Cetra recording of the role 30 years earlier. All said, the champagne is quite flat here and it would be better to look elsewhere if you want to hear this opera with all the panache Donizetti intended."
5,Fantastic....,"This is simply a great concept. Take an old, forgotten, Chilean band, and make their songs your own while bringing THAT BAND back to life. The Tacubos are some of the best cover song recorders. They remake all songs on this E.P. absolutely perfectly in the taste and originality that only they can do. Classic no doubt, mainly for true collectors."
4,"RE: ""POR QUE COPIAR A LOS CHILENOS""","OYE ESTUPIDO, EN QUE CABEZA CABE QUE LOS TACUBAS QUERIAN IMITAR A ESA BANDA DE MIERDA QUE TIENEN ""LOS TRES"" QUE NADIE LOS CONOCE FUERA DE CHILE? QUE MIERDA TENES EN LA CABEZA? DEBERIAN AGRADECERLES A LOS TACUBAS QUE GRACIAS A ELLOS ""LOS TRES"" RESUCITARON - AUUNQUE NO DURARON MUCHO NI CON ESTA AYUDITA PUESTO QUE SU MUSICA SIGUE SIENDO UNA PORQUERIA - ""LOS TRES"" SOLO SACARON ESOS 4 TEMAS BUENOS EN SU DISCOGRAFIA DE 15 ALBUMS - QUE VERGUENZA! Y SOBRE LOS MOLOTOV: ESA ES UNA BOSTA MAS PASADA DE MODA QUE ""LOS PRISIONEROS"". METETE TUS MOLOTOV, TU PISCO Y TUS TRES EN EL CULO, ROTO CHILENO, CULIAO!"
1,Porque copiar a los chilenos,ami me gustava cafetacuba pero desgrasiadamente nos copio nuestra cansiones escrita por chilenos y cantada por un grupo muy popular en chile ellos nos copia y saca su version mala de nuestra cansiones y porsupuesto la nuestra es mejor.mojor compren cd's de molotov porlomenos no andan a copiando a cantante de sudamerica.
4,"I knew who the were, but didn't really know their music","I'm not implying i was friends with the cats (because i wasn't). But i'd like the 2 songs i'd heard from their first album, but had know idea this album ever came out til a friend gave it to me. I listened to that album all the rest of freshman year, I loved it!Since some reviewers put their favorite tracks down, i'll give it a try also. Hmm.. lol, i think it's Groupie Theory (that intro is hilarious!)... oo! Hey you! is butter too. Those two.Dag, the memories this album is bringing back..."
5,Good Music,I love this U got underground hits left and right from beginning to end on this one please buy if you like Tribe Called quest De la Soul type music smoothness Night time music
4,"Inventive, creative and entertaining","The Pharcyde got truly inventive style. If you enjoy hip hop jems like pete rock & c.l smooth or de la soul, pick up this album. Dis album features creative soulful lyrics over smooth jazzy beats and is a great listen for when ya all chillin' and laid back in ya crib."
5,Get this CD!!,"The title of this review says it all!! This 5 track CD EP is a solid 5 stars and a must have.Simon's songwriting and playing have continually progressed and this, his latest CD, is a great representation. The songs range from upbeat ballads, ""Experience"" and ""Soul Searching"", to flat out rockers, ""First Time"". Songs like ""Ages"" and ""Comeback"", in addition to spotlighting the talented band, also reveals the lyrical depth that Simon has achieved. Nevertheless, you will find yourself tapping along to the music and setting the repeat button on the player.The band consists of Simon, Ben Townshend and ""Among Us"" (another great CD BTW) contributor Tony Lowe. This line-up works well together. The music really grooves here.Give this new CD a try, you'll be pleased you did!!"
5,I loved it,"This EP is cool, short and sweet. It includes some great pieces by Simon and his band. This cd is great to listen to in the car."
2,Ha! A brick to warm the armchair traveller.,"I did originally choose this book because of the great reviews, and because it was one of the most recent publications. It is a fine tome to read for those who are planning a trip. Long term planning, I mean -- read it six months before you go, because that's how long it takes to read and digest all the information. Or even better -- read it and don't bother to go. This book has so many photographs that you barely need to see the stuff for yourself. It weighs about six kilos, so don't plan on taking it anywhere with you.Otherwise -- a good review of history and valuable detail. It was worth poring through before I moved to Moscow, but a smaller, handier travel guide would be a better reference while traipsing through the city's well-kept secrets."
4,Shadow Dawn redeems the Willow saga after shaky start in SM,"After Shadow Moon, I was a little nervous about trying Shadow Dawn, but as a fan of the movie Willow, I had to find out what was going to happen next. The pace of this new one was definitely more even, and Claremont was able to paint a clear picture of the action. Elora Danan takes the center stage literally and figuratively; she is the main character of Shadow Dawn instead of Thorn Drumheller, appropriate enough since it is obvious that this trilogy is her story. It also becomes clear how this hunted and hated Sacred Princess is supposed to be the savior of the thirteen realms. This book takes a place on my bookshelf among few other all time favorites."
2,"Shadow War, Book 2",Things began to get confusing following the myriad trails of all the principal characters. It seemed repetitive and unnecessary. I wanted to resolve the confusion by going to Book III. Some of the writing resembles a script rather than a story with particulars that help the reader grasp the action.
2,"An OK continuance of the story, but not as good as the first","""Shadow Dawn"" continues the new ""Willow"" saga fairly effectively, but the major problems in the book lie in the abilities of the writer. Overall, the story could've used a bit more polish and a pinch more originality; an entire scene in the book is blatantly stolen from the film ""Braveheart,"" while clumsily palliated in a story-within-the-story. While ""Shadow Moon"" gave us the future of the Willow saga so many of us had grown to love, ""Shadow Dawn"" stumbles along until finally reaching a morass of odd story twists and dragged-out characterization."
2,"Getting better, there's some hope yet","Better than Shadow Moon, but not by too much. The writing has improved, the characters are slightly more believable. But I still get the impression that I've missed something. The ideas flow from the authors faster than they can absorbed by the reader. It's like watching the T.V. with the sound off, you are only getting a portion of what is meant. I commented that the first book, Shadow Moon needed an impartial, unfamiliar editor to ask questions and to fill in the blanks for us. The same goes for Shadow Dawn. I finished the book as unsatisfied as if it had been put down in the middle. Again I ask ""What was that all about? What happened?"" Maybe part 3 will be better?"
5,I loved the book!,"I had just finishing reading Shadow Moon about a month before and was thrilled to find out that the sequel was due out anytime! No having to wait a year or two between stories, though I don't see how I missed it so long! Both books I could not stop reading. I know the characters are different from the movie ""Willow"", but they are more captivating. I eagerly followed Elora through all her ups and downs, and was sorry the book came to end (though maybe now I will get some work done without the book in my hands!). I hope that there is a 3rd book, I do so want to read more about the characters I have come to love and I guess I will have to wait the traditional year or two this time. Oh, well...should be worth the wait"
2,Where is Sorsha and Madmartegin?,"I loved the movie, so when I heard about the book, I rushed to find it. I am absolutly obssessed with the movie and probably the reason I loved it so much was the humor between Sorsha and Madmartigan. I really liked Willow too. The book was good, I'll give it that, but I will always love the movie more. Why did the writers and George Lucas turn Willow into a cold, killing sorcerer, not the kind, self-concious farmer I fell in love with? I was so sad when I found out they killed off my two favorite characters! Why get rid of 3/4 of the reason I wanted to read the book? I thought the beginnig was hilarious because in my mind I could see Sorsha and Madmartigan (Joanne Whalley/Val Kilmer) fighting and making up. I was terribly disappointed that in this book they disposed of two of the greatest characters and substitued others that did not have that special quality"
4,Good but still jarring,"I loved Willow and I enjoyed this series especially once I got to book 3 but it is a hard sequel to the delightful original movie.However it is closer, but still darker than the original book written by Lucas for Willow.Another point I need to make. I previous reviwer complains about the character of The Lord of the Dance that appears. What this woman does not relize is that the Lord of the Dance is an old celtic song about celtic/christian mythos and was meerly used by Mr Flatley as his center piece of music for his show. The character has nothing to do with Flatley or his show but I can understand why people not into celtic music or tradition may assume it is from Flatley's show.Try these books they are quite good but do not look for a repeat of the movie!"
1,"Nice script, poor development into a novel","The way I see it, George Lucas wrote a nifty script and Chris Claremont tried to turn it into a novel, but gave up after his first draft. There are so many disjunct segments that don't flow into the next segment. Lots of nice descriptions, but the plot isn't carried along well. There's even a cut-and-paste paragraph 3/4 through the book that was used 1/4 of the way into the book. And the Braveheart reference brought me right out of the book to roll my eyes. I just couldn't get into a book that uses another story from a totally different genre and can't carry the plot along. I faithfully read the whole thing, complaining all the while... my husband tore up the book when I finished it and threw it in the recycling box. I wasn't heart broken at all. I wouldn't want others to waste their time."
4,"Hard to put down, but when finished, you've missed something","A fast, easy read. The futher I read the faster I found myself picturing the story. The story is a little complicated with a lot of traveling from one sceen to another and back. It was a good read and though at the ending there was no sense of closure to the book it was still worth the time spent."
2,Shadow Series Snoozer,"Willow was a good movie, but hopefully they don't turn the Shadow series books into a movie. Too much description, not much action. I kept reading, though, hoping the next book in the series would be better, only to be disappointed. I skipped pages at a time just to get to some sort of dialog or action. The brownies supposedly had a great wit, but there was no evidence of it in the books. Too bad, they could've been a great plus, like Tas the kender in the Chronicles series. As far as the Elora, the wittiest she ever got was by sticking her tongue out in response to any lame jokes the brownies made. In conclusion, don't waste your time with these books."
4,perfect,"This is a great chain. Solid, shiney and impressive. If it were made italy it would have gotten 5 stars."
2,Cute but Not Durable,"I bought this Kon plush a few months ago through Amazon and within a few weeks of buying it, the button came off and an arm ripped off. Thankfully, someone sewed it back together for me. The material is cheap and doesn't feel that soft. Kon's arms and legs look loosely sewed together and they will break very easily if someone were to pull at them. Overall, I bought it because I am a Bleach fan but the quality of the plush could be better..."
5,King. Of. New york,"I got Kon for a freind and myself because we're both big BLEACH fans and no collection is complete without Kon. My friend just loves him, he's so cute."
3,Photos too dark,"I bought this book because I teach 1st grade, and my students LOVE the book ""Look Alikes Jr."" But I was a little disappointed with the pictures in ""The More You Look the More You See"" because they were kind of dark. Because of this, it was hard for me to spot the details in the scenes.(My students still enjoyed it.)"
5,A clever book!,This was a clever book! I memorized many of the look-alikes in this book and pretend Boston is Look-Alike City.
5,I love this book,This book is full of clever ideas on how to trick the eye into thinking things are not what they seem. You must see (or not) to believe!
1,Bait and Switch,"Beware, all the pictures in this book have already been published in different cover, an earlier edition. If you think it is a new book of Steiner's work, it isn't, so don't get suckered."
4,This band keeps getting better...,"which is the best thing a band could ever do. The only reason I give this one 4 stars is because I have expectations for the next one to be even better and get the full 5 star treatment. This band has actually gotten more soulful, the melodies are getting stronger and the harmonizing is great - almost harks back to great early metal bands like Bloodrock. Not many bands are working in this territory and I give Sentenced FULL respect for putting out such an honest and real record like this. You won't be wasting your money here."
1,this sucked,"all i can say is that this sounds just like metalica. and personally i think that metalica is the weakist metal band around. this cd is NOT brutal, this is one of the most non brutal cds i have ever heard. i could fall right asleep listening to this."
5,Thank you Jack Jones,"How in the heck does this recording have just (two now) reviews . Downbeat gave it 4 and 1/2 out of 5 in a retro review they published . Let's put things into perspective . This is a 1963 recording . Hank Lones is the pianist . Illinios Jacquet in on tenor saxaphone on songs (1,4,6,8,10) . Kenny Burrell plays guitar on songs (2,3,9) . Jim Hall plays guitar on songs (1,6) . Milt hinton is the bassist . Elvin Jones the drummer . This IS the cat from THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY soundtrack . Mind bendingly essential gold . Really ? Yes....Benstarbuck"
4,Nice Romantic Music,"Yes this is a very pleasant listening experience, very romantic and moody, but it cannot be compared toJohn Coltrane & Johnny Hartman...No, I'm not saying that Coltrane is irreplacible, that would be a truism insulting to everyone's intelligence; my point is quite the opposite:this album failed to make use of its fine assembley of musician; some at the top of their game, some in their early bloom...Perhaps at least the part of the problem lies in the fact that the musicians are of the different generation, but when I hear Jacquet's Websterish contribution I wonder why, o why this album wasn't more jazzy..."
4,Classic Johnny,"I think that Johnny Hartmann is without question one of the best baritone voices ever. This album just goes towards solidifying that. ""In the wee small hours"" is enough to buy the album alone. This album is not the masterpiece of Hartman and Coletrane but what is? A definite for your Johnny Hartman library."
4,Smooth as it gets,"I'm not a big fan of most jazz vocalists but I LOVE Johnny Hartman! I bought this record a few days ago and I'm totally digging it. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I've been spoiled over the last few years by the album he did with Coltrane. Don't get me wrong, Illinois Jacquet lays down some great tones on this album, but the Hartman/Coltrane album has a lot more horn woven through the entire record, and it's quite hypnotizing. HOWEVER, this album has something the Coltrane album doesn't have- GREAT guitar work! Kenny Burrell is a genius, and Jim Hall is very talented as well.A year or so back I fell in love with the Sinatra record In the Wee Small Hours but I've gotta admit, the Johnny Hartman version of ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning"" eclipses Frank's version! If you're searching for something to spin on a romantic evening with that special someone, something smoother than glass, give Johnny Hartman a spin. You WON't be disappointed!"
2,sherwood rx-4107,"The remote would not work with the first reciever, so I sent it back for a replacement. This one work fine, however when I tried to register the warranty on line, the web address could not be found. Makes me wonder is Sherwood still in business?????"
1,"Do Not Buy This, Save your money !","I thought maybe it was my speakers, so I replaced them....Then I was told it was my speaker wire, so I replaced them...I wasted a lot of money for This expensive receiver....I replaced it, put it in a box & since the warranty return period is now up...I tossed it, it's manual & box all in the garbage where it belongs!"
3,Product Dimensions Incorrect,"I'm keeping the unit, but the product dimensions are radically incorrect. The dimensions are actually: 17 3/8 X 13 X 5 7/16. It is that height number, as opposed to the 4.1 listed in the specks online, that is troublesome. Given that it is a low end, lower powered unit, I believed that it might be correct, even though I have been unable to find a unit that size to replace a 30 year old Kenwood that just fit on my refrigerator. This unit has been placed on top of the cabinet structure, functional but not nicely hidden as the Kenwood was.Secondly, I had to do the UPS dance because I was not aware that a signature would be required. This is always aggravating and costs time and trips to the local depot.The unit is functioning properly so far, including the remote control."
2,A receiver that won't even receive local FM stations,"This receiver's scan feature for finding stations wouldn't even pick up local stations no matter what we did with the antennae. Most features required using the remote, which is bad considering most people have a tendency to misplace their remotes. Don't lose the instruction manual - without it you will be lost. The instruction manual had a picture of the remote with a description of how to use the buttons but the problem with that is the picture was on one page and you had to flip the page to see what the button did and most times it required you to push several buttons so by the time you flipped back to see where the next button you needed to push was located it timed out and you had to start over. I love remotes but I also want to be able to do the steps manually on the unit itself. We are keeping it and will use it elsewhere in the house and get another higher priced more user friendly receiver for our entertainment center needs."
3,Not 100 watts per channel.,I'm sure this tuner if fine... but just FYI it is not 100 Watts as it stated in the description when I bought it.
1,Dimensions are wrong,I bought this to fit in a 4 1/2 inches high area. The dimensions say it is 4.1 inches high. It is actually 5 inches high. Just incase anyone buying this is spacially challenged like I am.I can make it work but I'm gonna have to cut out some of the cabinetry. I live in a RV incase you were wondering.
3,Great While it Lasted,This is a great receiver until... It dies. I have had this receiver for roughly over a year. All I used it for was to play the sound through my ipod and xbox. Well i was playing Black Ops and all the sudden no sound. I trouble shot and tried different outlets. Now its dead. I do not recommend this reviver if you plan on making it last or if your going to use it almost every day.
3,"Fine for the price, tuner section not that hot.",I bought this to use in the garage and to drag to the cottage. Perfect for hooking up the MP3 player and playing through any old speakers.I tried the tuner section. It did not pick up stations that a 40 year old Sony picked up fine.
3,Solid Low End Stereo Unit,"If you are looking for a solid low end stereo unit than this is just fine. It is not full of useless features. The AM/FM section works well and it has plenty of pre-sets (to fill). I would not suggest pushing this amplifer toward the 100W rating because it does not any large heat sinks to provide for cooling. It does have (stereo)inputs for TV/VCR, CD, a tape player/recorder. It also has a full feature remote but I find it awkward to use. The buttons on it get stuck if you are not careful about pressing them. Once they get stuck the unit seems to have a mind of it's own (till un-stuck). As long as your looking for just a minimum stereo reciever then you will not be disapointed."
4,Works Great,"Does exactly what it was supposed to. Menu was a little hard to figure out, but that seems to be common with stereo recievers. Sound is fine and the remote is nice (only complaint would be that it would be nice if there was bass control on the controller so I wouldn't have to edit it via the actual reciever). Good for the price."
3,A Little Dissapointed,"I got this Sherwood Amp on sale at Circuit City about four years ago. It gives good sound at a high volume. I had discovered about two years ago that after running it constantly for about three to four hours, it would just shut down. I thought it was overheating because it did not have an internal cooling fan,so I rigged a fan for it, it still shut down, now if I turn it up past 15, it shuts down completely. I guess for 90 bucks I shouldn't be mad, but I did expect more from a Sherwood."
4,Sherwood RX-4105 Stereo Receiver,"Just what I was looking for. My older standard 2-channel stereo finally quit and we needed an inexpensive receiver at our barn...nothing fancy, just needed to play FM and plug in an ipod. This unit has nice appearance, set up easily and for being under $100, the sound and quality is surprisingly good. Plenty of inputs and has A & B speaker function so we can use the speakers in the ranch office as well as outside the barn. I only rated 4 stars because it is a stripped down receiver, not becasue of any quality issue."
4,Simple. Easy. Great,"I use this receiver to make up for the shortcomings with the tinny speakers that come with my LCD tv. Absolutely perfect for this, and simple enough to use. Sound is just fine for me, and more than enough power to push the speakers. The only thing that would make it perfect for me would be an equalizer for a more customizable sound, because you can only adjust bass & treble. For those with Dish Network, be forewarned that their universal remote will NOT work with this receiver, even though they list 5-6 codes for Sherwood receivers in the manual."
4,Sherwood RX-4105 2-Channel 100-Watt Stereo Receiver,perfect.would have been nice if i didnt haave to turn off the speakers for the head phone to work. sound excellent though and very affordable.
1,Do not under any circumstances buy this item!,"Where do I start, well upon setting this thing up it powered down five seconds after I powered it up. this product is not worth it, get something better, and that may mean pay more for it."
4,receiver,I purchased this to pick up some radio stations along with what I got thru the TV so it works as an amplifier too. Works great.
4,Just what I was looking for,It does exactly what I want it to do and has yet to disappoint me.Review needs to be 5 words longer.
4,Excellent value,"I bought one for my satellite receiver in the den and liked it so well that I bought a second one for the TV/VCR/DVD/CD in the living room. It's not fancy, but it serves its intended purpose very well for a very modest price."
4,Great value for price,"I bought this receiver for a specific purpose and was focused on a low cost item with the intention of abusing the unit. I use this receiver for use on an outdoor screened-in porch (lanai for you Floridians). It powers 4 small outdoor speakers and I run only the radio and my iPod through it. For the price (~$80), it is just what I wanted. Simple stereo, not too many features, good sound performance. Note that there is no surround on this, so know what you're buying. I didn't need it, so it works great for me.It's protected from direct elements, but is exposed to moisture and dust and it's performed well so far for 1 season."
5,good performance good price,At first when i got this amp it did not perform well and it overheated ..then i took it to the sound shop and tried it on several speaker systems and it perormed very well on the correct equiptment it did so well that i can say the owners of the shop bought some to retail in their store and it was comparable to the sony and technics amps they had. This thing is very capable of pushing four 15inch speakers at 8ohms anything below and it overheats highly recommended ot those of you who like old technology mixed with new tech...
1,A piece of garbage,"Four months after purchase, the Receiver misfunction and shut down. It was impossible to contact Sherwood Electronics which had no service Centers in the State of Wisconsin. Therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on. Check out a Sherwood Service center in your state prior to purchase."
4,I was lucky and got a working Sherwood radio,"I've had my Sherwood RX-4105 for about 1 year. I've never had any problems with it, so I've never had to deal with customer service."
1,Didn't Work Out of the Box,"Hooked up the speakers and plugged it in. Standby lite came on. Turned the power on, unit played for 15-20 seconds then reverted to standby. Disconnected speakers, same thing happened. Called Sherwood(it was not easy to reach them). Was told I should be using 16 ohm speakers. Nothing about that in the specs. Two service repair centers listed on their website. Called both, neither knew anything about Sherwood. Returning it to Amazon in exchange for another brand."
1,Unhappy Customer,"The receiver worked fine for about 3 month. Now I can't get it out of standby mode, no matter what I try. I can't even turn it OFF, it just stays in standby mode. What a waste of money, even if it was only 90 bucks."
5,Solid Product,I got it for my birthday. I did everything I wanted it to and surprised me with a couple of features like Dimmer and Sleep.
5,sherwood 100 watt receiver,I had to write this as I read so manythis was a perfect gift for me! It works greatIt does not like the music blasting real high--it will cutoff if you do so. It is one of the best bargainson the market and lives up to the Sherwood name for the money/All channels work and aI have the TV PC and Play station hooked upflawless
1,Stereo Receiver broke down,"The product came intact, but after a bit of use it broke within 3 days. It wasn't even an intensive use. Terrible product."
3,AM/FM Sensitivity,"The RX-4105 was purchased to augment my video editing system. The tape and VCR channels are excellent. Within my computer room, the receiver picks up too much noise for AM and FM reception, using local antenas. Until I can install outside antennas, I have to use an old portable for radio."
1,JUNK !,"Don't be Dont be deceived by the good looks of this receiver and the Sherwood name. These are garbage,and not even worth their $89.00 price. I know of 2 other poeple that have purchased these,and have had the same experience with them that I have. The audio quality is worse than any receiver I have ever heard. Comparable with a boom box in quality. There is also no way that these put out anything close to 105 watts per channel. Not even close.Save your money,and spend $150-$200 for a decent 100 watt receiver. Common sense dictates that you aren't going to get much for $89.00,and this Sherwood receiver proves it. A pretty $89.00 box with bad sound...."
5,Description let incomplete.,"Sound was good for the price. No phono preamp (turntable in), no dedicated sub out, and rather large in comparison to other receivers with comparable features."
3,Sherwood RX4109 2-Channel 100-Watt Stereo Receiver (Black),"Unit was received promptly and was exactly as described. The unit does everything as was expected from it with the exception of the Radio part of it. The AM requires too much of an antenna for AM, to receive even local, the FM similar. It requires more than a $10.00 transistor radio, to receive. If you are aware of that, it functions as an amplifier very well. The controls are a bit more complicated than necessary,but I can live with it. The set seems to be built very well. Sherwood RX4109 2-Channel 100-Watt Stereo Receiver (Black)"
1,Don't buy this receiver,I would be embarrassed if I was Sherwood. I had a crystal set when I was a kid that sounded better.I bought a Pyle-2x75 watts for $50.00 that sounds much cleaner than this thing. I understand you get what you pay for but someone should pay me to listen to this garbage machine. I wouldn't use this receiver for a paperweight. Because of this experience I will never buy a Sherwood product.
1,Needs Serious Re-engineering,Receiver cuts out when volume is raised. Needs to be re-engineered with higher quality components. The Sherwood name must be only being used as a lure. The Sherwood of yesteryear would never have allowed their name to used on product of this low quality.
4,The Sherwood arrived today,"I unpacked and connected to a pair of Bose 201 speakers...sounds great! Had to read the manual to figure out how to set presets and manually tune...not hard. The sound is clean. I would have wanted phono inputs too, but hey theres only a few of us left. Otherwise, this seems to be well made and quite powerful. So far so good..."
5,Works Great,I own 3 of these recievers I like sherwood they are greatI have one hooked to the computer one to the tv and oneis used for stereo I have not had any problems with any of them.
5,Worth The Price Of Admission,"I picked up this Sherwood RX-4105 Receiver to hook into my best friends computer and she loves it. Now she doesn't have to listen to her ipod thru those tiny little speakers. We pick up a pair of floor speakers and another pair of desktop speakers (infinity). Sounds a lot better than I expected too. 100 watts is more than enough power to fill her office.Just FYI: The unit sent was all black --not the slate color depicted in the photo.For the money, you can't go wrong!"
1,Hissing noise. Broken after 6 months.,"I bought this to use as a simple amplifier for my computer. I didn't need any extra features so for the low price this seemed like a good choice. It wasn't. There is a high frequency hissing noise coming from the amp to the speakers, although the headphones sounded ok. This hissing is common in cheap amps it seems. I could live with the hissing, but the whole thing stopped working after about six months of light use. I wish someone made reliable low cost power amps for stereo speakers and headphones! I guess I'll have to pay extra for a reliable 7.1 receiver which I'll never use the extra features of."
2,Not the Sherwood product of the past.,The first receiver failed to deliver acceptable Am or FM reception and was returned as defective. The replacment worked fine for three days and then delivered reception too poor for comfortable listening. The replacement Sony works perfectly.
5,Its worth every cent.,"So far I love this receiver. It has worked well and is very simple to use. Some have said setting the presets is difficult but I thought it was very simple. I paired this stereo with a pair of Element ESB1 speakers from tigerdirect.com and a powered sub-woofer and could not be happier with this product. I've read so many reviews saying the sound quality sucks and marking the lack of surround features as a con. I don't understand this. It's not a con of this product, if that's what you want, go buy one that is made for that. I disagree with the bad FM reception. I live roughly 40 miles from all of the radio stations and picked up over 20 stations and have half of the presets used using just the supplied antenna. I feel this receiver gets a lot less credit then whats it's worth. If you have been pondering over this unit, do yourself a favor and buy it."
4,bang for the buck,"Price is what sold me on this particular receiver. In the time that i have had it, it has sounded good and performed as expected."
2,Decent overall but radio reception is terrible,Purchased this a few weeks ago and it appears to be a decent receiver. My major complaint is that the FM reception is virtually non-existent. I live within 15 miles of downtown Atlanta and usually have no problems pulling in many stations but this thing could not pull in even one station.To be fair I drove the receiver to another location across town and experienced the same thing. Terrible reception. I ensured that the supplied el-cheapo antenna wires (both am and fm) were attached properly and experimented with placement.My other concern is the speaker feeds on the back of the receiver. Seem poorly designed to me.I will say it's a good looking receiver and the sound quality while playing CD's and DVD's is good. Nice remote also.I rate it as a poor buy due to the reception issue.For the price it's ok if your not interested in the radio.
2,No radio stations,"I thought this was a great buy for what I wanted and was very excited to try it out.After I hooked it all up and tried to tune in radio stations I could only get like 2 stations and I even put FM antenna out the window.Too bad,if it wasn't for that I would of kept it."
4,A real value.,"Works fine. Good remote control. The receiver has a good feature of being able switch tone back and forth between a self selected sound or what is being send by the medium, DVD, CD, TV. And it is really low priced!"
4,A Receiver of Merit and Value,"This receiver seems to be a great value. I'm not an audiophile, but it does everything I need it to do. I use it primarily to amplify my computer for playing music with iTunes. Set up was easy and intuitive. The remote is an unexpected treat."
5,sherwood reciever,"usally prefer buying from local vendors but thought this was a high value product. intended originally,for the garage. but ended up replacing the house stereo instead. got item a day ahead of scheduled delivery very satisfied"
4,Better than the other thing I had...,"So my mom's old NEC stereo receiver caught fire after 23 years of service (they just don't make 'em like that anymore), so naturally I jump to the task of being the better child of 2, and purchase this replacement.Negative:Big, takes up a lot of space in our hutch, was difficult to wire in that space.Positive: Easy to install, easy to use.Great overall replacement."
3,Healthy southern cooking...,"No, that is not an oxymoron! I was raised in Louisiana and Texas and I am very picky about ""home cooking."" This book has delicious and light recipes that are easy to make. My entire family loves the food from this book. I find myself reaching for this one over and over again. The stuffed artichoke tastes just like you get in New Orleans!"
5,Boy Scout Must,"Every driver for Boy Scout campouts and hikes should have a copy to play on the ride there. The songs are so funny, it really gets everyone involved."
4,Dr.Demento-Still CrazyAfter AllTheseYears,"I've been a huge fan of Dr.Demento since the mid-1970's-Unfortunately,his program isn't heard in the NY metro area at the present time,which is a doggone shame-You will not be disappointed with this particular anthology-My favorite cuts are ""The Elements"",""Deteriarota"",""Ice Box Man"",& that ode to pulchritude,""Bras on 45""-If you're a true Dementite or Dementoid, you must purchase this one."
3,"Not as good as the 20th Ann. , but better than the 25th.","This collection is an improvement over the 25th anniversary collection, but, it doesn't come close to topping the 20th anniversary CD's. The 30th anniversary collection lacks the mixture of old and new as the 20th had, sticking more with contemporary numbers. But, a few great oldies like Phil Harris's ""The Thing"" spice up the mix. Weird Al's ""Biggest Ball Of Twine"" was certainly welcome, but, a rather odd choice from the Weird One, given the other Al pieces.And, where's Spike Jones?All in all, a decent collection, but, you're probably better off if you get this collection only if you're aware of the tracks already and you know/want/like them. And, if you're looking for a good sample of contemporary dementia, it's here."
5,Even better than a hamster sandwich,"Nice to have ""Hamster Love"" and ""Rock And Roll Doctor"" on CD at last. The 3 Dr. Demento anniversary collections are the black sheep of my music collection (along with ""Golden Throats""). Actual chart hits and gems from DD's radio show make these the best history of the novelty record you can find. Anyone with a sense of humor should enjoy this."
1,Poor Quality,We received the pump and installed it for the new year during good weather. It lasted 4 days and quit working. I have re-ordered a second one hoping this is just a case of getting the one lemon in stock.
4,"Failed in 3 Months, but replaced under warranty","The pump initially worked very well, being both quiet and powerful. However, after 89 days of service it failed completely. It was pumping air into a depth of 2 feet.Update: Contacted manufacturer. The unit is under warranty and they committed to replace it. The new pump arrived and works well."
5,Really awesome air pump!,"Simply the best and quietest pumps I have ever used. This is not your regular whisper air pumps! It pushes a lot of air and works like a champ. Reliability is second to none with a great warranty to boot. Like all pumps the diaphrams will eventually wear out (though not for YEARS). These air pumps are made with some heavy duty diaphrams and replacment parts are everywhere on the internet. Replacment is simple enough. Buy it your fish and your ears will be happy you did. Smashes Renas, regular whispers, (especially)JW's, and all other pumps in it's class."
5,The Quietest Air Pump I've Barely Heard,"Our old air pump quit and we bought three different ones to try out as a replacements.This one, the Whisper 300, won by a landslide! It is, by far, the quietest air pump I've barely heard! It's definitely worth the extra bucks!"
4,An excellent source for information to supplement a casebook,"This is another in the long line of hornbooks from West publishing. It is an excellent source to supplement and even embellish the law of Civil Procedure contained in whichever casebook you are using. Since most Civil Procedure courses are a year long, I would strongly recommend investing in this hornbook, it is very handy to have when outlining and preparing for finals."
1,It's crap....that's why it wasn't released!,"Let's face it, these songs suck. I'm a big fan and love their stuff. I thought, ""There has to be at least ONE good track on here, right?"" WRONGDEAD WRONG. Even the band doesn't like theses songs and called them terrible, and that should tell you something. If they had released this as planned, and I bought it as a legitimate album, I would no longer be a fan.Crap is crap, and AFD sure sucks.Die hard fans may own it, but only the delusional will call it ""good""."
1,the real reason,"ok, i know a lot of you dont know whay pm5k released this..ill tell you why: september 11, 2001 + ""anyone for doomsday?"" = stupid worries from stupid people who think its inapropirate to name their cd ""anyone for doomsday,?"", just like it seemed so wrong to play john lennons ""imagine"" on the radio after Sept. 11. so with all due respect, im a big pm5k fan, but jesus christ that was a fxcking stupid move by powerman. lets hope they can at least gain some of their decency with ""Transform"""
4,Sounds Pretty Darn Good To Me,"Without boring anyone with a long breakdown of the CD, here it is plain and simple: If you are a fan of PM5K, get this CD. It wasn't released because the band wasn't happy with the sound of it, but if you are a real fan, then you will like it. It can't be that bad if half of the songs have shown up as singles and/or on soundtracks.And to Mr. Expert- this disc does indeed have an album cover, and it looks very similar to the Mega and Stars cover. I bought this CD at Best Buy for $29.99 because it was listed as an import. I have actually seen it show up at various Best Buy's over the last couple years (in multiple states), so there are some legit copies out there. And don't pay that knucklehead $120 for it, that's insane."
2,Wrong Genre,"Never heard it but don't like the concept. Oh by the way the other players are Richard Williams trumpet, Clifford Jordan tenor saxophone, Julian Priester trombone, Mal Waldron piano and Art Davis on bass. according to the Penquin Guide To Jazz Recordings. They praise Williams for his trumpet work but neglect to mention the Chorus and Orchestra.Is this really Jazz? It could be construed as a Chorus and Orchestra borrowing a some jazz players for their next album, and it should be classified in their section."
3,well worth a second chance,"this is an edited version of my inicial review of this title;I still have this cd and it is rarely played. It has such wonderful player, but it is so dominated with the chorus. I have to say that there are so many other great recordings to listen to that this one never gets picked. I wish it did not have the chorus at all. With musicians such as these and a great cover by Prophet (eric dolphy had his work on his first 2 lps for New Jazz), this should have been a quartet or quintet recording. These selections deserve it. 3 stars for the main players (it would be 5 without the oohhs and ahhhs)"
5,Love This Cd,I loved Andy and David as a kid and I am a fan now. They still have music that is a real pleasure to listen too. The harmony between them is always the best.
3,Disapointing,"Although there are a few moments of brightness, the album drowns in a syrupy morass of heartbreak cliches, both lyrical and musical. The sound is that of a seventies tear jerk band like Dr Hook or late Burritos. You really don't need to here this, try Slaid Cleeves instead"
5,Very good overview,"Contrary to some of the other reviews I think this is a great book; it's one of the only books I've found that gives a ""complete"" overview of the film-making process with 3ds Max. While the content may not be in it's final stage; I think the major problem most would have with it is the fact that it claims to be professional work instead of merely educational examples like most books. I've always found its better to learn with ""real"" examples, so while I don't know how good the film would do they are excellent learning tools."
3,"Great playing, but...","Or course these all-stars deliver a beautiful Archduke, but I didn't pay enough attention to the rest of the menu before buying: the 5-minute, single-movement 7th. This brings the total music on this CD to 42 minutes and change--a skimpy meal, for whatever reason.Certainly another, full-length trio could have been paired with the Archduke. If you want more for your money, look for another good version."
3,"A surprisingly polite reading, and very short shrift","It's not really defensible for EMI to issue a 44 min. CD when the Archduke is almost always paired with the ""Geist"" Trio #2 or a masterpiece from another composer. If Perlman-Ashkenzy-Harrell gave a blazing performance, I could see accepting such short shrift. To my ears they don't. In fact, theirs is a rather polite approach, considerably less expressive than the more forward Archduke from Istomin-Stern-Rose on a budget Sony CD paired with the ""Geist.""I can't say which member of this trio is leading the way in caution and reserve--they all seem to agree that it's what they want. But I lost interest long before the variations in the Andante third movement reached the halfrway point. Beethoven's piano trios don't rank at the summit with his string quartets, but why play them like jaunty Haydn, and with such timid attack?"
4,Great for beginners,"I've been studying the Japanese language on my own for six years now. Of all the Japanese-English dictionaries I laid my hands on, this one has been the most helpful and the one I take anywhere.This compact version of my favorite M/W Japanese Learner's Dictionary has every word listed explained sufficiently, and differences in usage are shown in the examples. As certain English words have different meanings depending on context, that context is also mentioned here as not to confuse with others. Words with same kana writing but different kanji are written in separate entries as well.A quick reference for translating from English to Japanese is also included in the back, but since it's only the dictionary form, you'll have to conjugate it before using it.Grammar notes, counting suffixes, era tables in Japanese history are also included.You'll need a separate reference for kanji, by the way."
4,My favorite,"Like many students of Japanese I have several dictionaries, but this is the one I keep coming back to. It has numerous examples, usage notes, and cross references to synonyms and antonyms. Of all my dictionaries it has the highest hit rate when trying to find an unfamiliar word. It has good explainations of each particle, too. Just like it says on the cover, this is a Japanese to English dictionary with a short English to Japanese glossary in an appendix. Although the main entries are in roomaji, the main entries are also in kana/kanji and the examples are both in roomaji and kana/kanji. $6.95 well spent."
2,No good for novice English Speaking students.,"You have to be careful before buying this book. It only includes Japanese to English translation. If you are an novice English Speaking student trying to learn Japanese, this book is definitely not for you! If you are an Advanced student and only need an occasional glance you might think about it."
3,Part of 10 nozzle system,These are the least favorite ones in the shower. Still had to cut a hole out for them so I would have rather gone with a flush mount for looks. These operate exactly like the other ones in the Koeler lline.
2,Ogio Metro Backpack,"While the backpack seems well designed with enough pockets and space, it has two flaws. The first is very poor padding on the bottom of the pack. My backpack fell off my suitcase while standing in line at the airport, landing on the bottom. The computer screen cracked as the result of a two foot drop. The second flaw is that the zipper that closes the computer compartment can be separated from the body of the flap covering the computer. The nylon shreds and releases the zipper entirely. This is most noticable when the body of the backpack is full with other papers and the corner of the computer pushes on the zipper. I have had two Ogio metro packs (got from my employer) and both failed at the computer pouch zipper."
1,OGIO Metro Backpack,"When my oldest son purchased an OGIO Metro Pack I thought it was a well thought out backpack. It seemed to be the perfect backpack for our needs so I ordered two more, one for both my younger son and myself. After just two months all three OGIO Metro Packs are coming apart at the seams. Either OGIO has compromised their quality or we were stuck with a shoddy knock off. Before purchasing these backpacks, both of my sons had OGIO backpacks that lasted well over 3 years of hard wear. I'm very disappointed and unfortunately did not keep the receipts. I guess the lesson here is BUYER BE AWARE OF ONLINE PURCHASES. When ordering through Amazon.com, you never know if the company that you end up ordering the product from is truly and authorized seller of the product that you are ordering."
1,Horrible,"This bag is good, but none of the zippers work. When you unzip one, it gets stuck or does not close when you slide it. I called Ogio and they were not helpful at all. Wish I could give it zero stars."
1,Traffic Seeker Does not support their product or answer emails,"I have been trying, for several months now, to get a reply from these guys. They do not reply to email support questions. Nor do they provide updates ""monthly"" to the database as promised in their literature.My version does not ""remember"" the search engines associated with each Project. So it is basically useless junkware. I am not at all happy. As I understand it, they were the authors of ""SoftSpider"". They walked away from that product eventhough they had promised life time updates when I purchased the product. There is ZERO support for that and now also ZERO support for Traffic Seeker. At least up until now, that is my experience. Stay away from this product!"
3,Traffice Seeker,"The Traffic Seeker Professional edition, does what it claims. It is the best SEO engine for the price. You can submit to websites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia. This version only allows you to submit to less than 200,000 locations. If you want to submit to the FFA sites, you have to pick and choose or upgrade which could cost you as much as $299.My usual solution is to submit to the regular Google Germany, France, etc. Then use the same project to submit to a few of the FAA sites. It may take two submissions but it is worth. If you are familiar with FFA you are going to get a lot of confirmation email so it best to have a email address set up for that."
1,DO NOT GET THIS PROGRAM FROM WEBGRIP,"I bought the Platinum program for one hundred and ninety nine bucks and it works for awhile. Customer service is aweful. They used to be good and answer your questions, but now its like they went out of business, and guess what guys, if they go out, so does your program, no warning. All thier programs have a phone home to check to see if your copy is legit and if it gets no confirm it shuts it down. That is where I am at. They dont answer the phone or emails. Web Grip is missing in action. Right now I am fighting with them through the better business Bureau and they arent wanting to help at all. It took the BBB to get them to respond at all.Look elsewhere and dont get anything from WebGrip as you will be left holding the bag."
5,Linksys WPC300N,I have a PC that has USB problems but was able to get connected using the Notebook adapter. Works Great.
2,Very dissapointing,"I bought two of these thinking that I could speed up my wireless network in my home. But neither card worked very well in either of my Sony laptops. In fact the cards were very difficult to even get working properly. The G band WiFi in the notebooks are actually faster than the supposed N band with the card. A complete waste of money. I was always a Linksys buyer, but I think I will be going with D-Link from now on because Linksys is obviously farming out production overseas and getting a very poor product to peddle."
2,Not a plug and play,"I had a seriously tough time installing this PCMCI wireless adapter card into my HP computer with XP & service pack 3. The CD software was out of date and did not allow a successful driver install, so I downloaded the latest, but stumbled when the laptop did not auto detect the new hardware when the card was inserted. Called linkSys technical support three times in Philippine, not much help, and their tier-2 technicians never called back as promised. Looks like this company can't keep up with all problems people like me are encountering with their product... What a waste of time! the only good thing is that the Amazon seller promised to reimburse me after mailing this card back."
1,Did not work for me.,"I upgraded both my B router and B pcmcia card for my ASUS laptop to N. The router Linksys WRT300N did not work till I upgrated the firmware. The original driver for Linksys WPC300N (April 2006) got me connected to router and network, but could not browse. Switched back to B card and waited till new driver was available. Even after the new driver (July 2006) was loaded still not working. I am back on B card till Linksys debugs this one."
2,not worth the trouble,"The reason this product got 2 stars was due to it being so cheap, otherwise, it was not a good purchase. As a matter of fact, I just returned it.The problem I had was that it would not maitain a connection. It kept dropping every 3 or 4 minutes for 20 to 25 seconds. I hit many message boards and tried to tweak the settings to change whatever was causing it, but I could not correct it. I have not had that problem with any other wireless devices. Further, the installed software to configure the device is piss poor. It just didn't work and you had to outsmart it to get it to configure it, and I ended up switching to windows controlling the device (though the same problem occurred for both).It seems like a good buy, but it is not worth the trouble. Maybe with a firmware update once the wireless-N is finalized..."
3,Fast but range is questionable,"This wireless-N adapter is very easy to install. It is as plug and play as you get. It connects well with my Linksys N router. It also connects easily at public hot spots. The speed seems to be the same as my other N adapters when close to the router. When I use it at the other end of my house, it gets only 3 bars when my Dell internal adapter gets all 5. My Dell internal uses 3 antennas built in around the monitor so to compare may be unfair. All in all a decent adapter for plug and play. I would buy it again as an add on."
2,Does not work in 5 GHz band,"Beware, this is a ""2.4 GHz only"" product. My understanding is that 802.11n should work either at 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz. This limitation was not clear to me.It seems to work just ""ok"" at 2.4 GHz (802.11g). I did not experience any significant improvement over my built-in wireless on my Dell D620 laptop.I use an Apple Airport Extreme (802.11n) router."
3,Good and iffy on WinXP and Linux,"The CD install blew up - installing through Windows worked. There are no Linux drivers and this is a Broadcom chipset card AFAIK ... Dual boot users note that I am still searching but ndiswrapper has been suggested as a Linux solution.This is a fine replacement for the internal card on my laptop, but it is not directly compatible with Linux. That's the bottom line.WinXP is still on my system and saving my butt."
2,The sound of no hand clapping,"I purchased this DVD based in part on the reviews here at amazon, which to date all give the film many stars and glowing descriptions. I beg to differ. Yes, there is a Zen element to the film, as well as a definite nod to the Noir genre. Of course, there as also acting, directing, and plot. All of these named elements of the film were shallow and amateurish in my humble opinion. And by the way, just because the lines are delivered excruciatingly slowly and there are long pauses between the lines does not make it more Zen. After viewing I looked at the awards and critical acclaim quotes on the cover of the DVD, as well as viewing again the glowing comments on amazon, and wonder if they all were made by friends and family members of the film's creators, a little too anxious to like this movie. I hesitate to negatively review things, but I wanted to throw a word of caution to others considering purchasing this movie. It may be worth seeing but not worth owning."
4,Need to do your Zen homework first,"I have just started studying Buddhism and Zen, so I could smile at the Zen humor. On the other hand, my wife and son just stared at the screen in complete boredom. I know this movie is a koan, 2 weeks later I am still trying to figure it out. A koan cannot be figured out with logic, so be prepared to feel confused (koans are supposed to confuse you) about how loved ones die and leave us heart broken, people in general just die, people commit suicide, and how all of us are slowly dying. All this death is like eating an orange. Hey, is that the answer to the koan?"
1,Is there anything lower than one star?,"I am shocked at how bad this movie is. Production values - ok. Script - ok. But it seems to be about itself, and i don't think that's zen; I think it's narcissism. I felt what it attempted to communicate was disingenuous. I was bored, and I was dismayed because I ordered it upon recommendation of someone whom I trust. It was NOT what i expected, but my challenge is that it was not fruitful, not for me, anyway."
3,Not real impressed,"I wasn't real excited about this one. I didn't think it was all that interesting or all that funny.It's about a guy (kind of a Humphrey Bogart tough guy type) in an undershirt and hat. He is an investigator and goes off to this Buddhist temple/meditation complex to find out why this Buddhist Monk died. On the idea that someone murdered him, he begins to question the inhabitants of the temple. They answer in Zen-type answers which is kinda funny but not all that funny. He falls for a bald lady Buddhist while he's there, but it's OK. He is pretty bald under the hat. You even get to see him butt-naked. (I could have passed on that.) He even takes his hat off.Actually, I was glad he took his clothes off, to air them out. I think he wore the same clothes for the whole time he was there investigating. I got the impression he was there for at least a week.In the end, he winds up learning the peaceful flow of Zen-living and more Zen stuff.Ehhh. I'll never watch it again."
1,Maybe it's camp.,"Possibly I just didn't get it. It reminded me of the very camp ""Batman"" series on TV. That series was so bad that it became good in a camp sort of way. I think this was a failed attempt to be in the ""so bad it is good"" genre."
5,AMAZING,"A remarkable film....extremely funny considering the monastic setting, while also appealing in its exploration of the mysteries of the self. Highly recommended to those who are not afraid of their own mind nor of their own spirituality!"
3,A buddhist film noir fable...,"A nice attempt, using the conventions of noir-ish detective stories to illustrate across some aspects of the buddhist concept of impermanence, and living in & appreciating the present, despite the awareness of the imminent presence of death. I only wish that the production values were a bit higher, and the lead's performance a bit ... subtler, perhaps... for those are the only things keeping this film from getting a higher rating, least from me. Chicago theater actress Debra Miller won best actress for her role as the dedicated practitioner, 'Jane' in this film at Chicago's Indiefest in 2004."
5,Better than I imagined,"Big Joe Turner is the Man! I was actually looking for ""Boss of the Blues"" but it is very pricy and I have a couple of other Quadromania compilations with which I am pleased so I decided to give this a try. I could say a lot, but this is just great music. Joe Turner should have a reputation as large as his suitcoats. He belongs right up there with anyone else from the 50s that get recirculated on oldies radio, except that he offers much more. He was around before the 50s and there is some great older material here. If you like blues, soul, or rock & roll, do yourself a favor and check out Big Joe Turner."
3,Previous reviewer - what the?,"Is the previous reviewer talking about the writing or the subject of the book? Hello! If you don't like the person you're reading about, then stop reading, yes she was pretty awful, but what about how it was written, what about the research, what about the author?Great book, great subject! Read it, really!"
4,From a true scholar...,"I had Dr. Ellwood as a professor last quarter. He is a true scholar, and one who knows how to focus on ultimate questions. I find this work very well written, clear, easy to read, and scholarly. Dr. Ellwood gets into subtleties that I have not found elsewhere. His profundity in reflection, coupled with a clear and precise exposition is refreshing. I would recommend this book without reservation to anyone interested either in Theosophy, or in issues addressed generally in meatphysics.Arthur Minassian, ESQ."
1,"Looks fabulous, but won't last more than 6 months!","We have owned this product for around 1 year now. 6 months after owning it the bi-cast leather began to crack severely and rip everywhere. Right now we have 3-4 very unsightly large rips. They can not be repaired. Don't be fooled by the con-artists who claim they can repair this. They can't. It is extremely embarrassing when we have parties, but we dumped $2,000 (price with Ottoman) and don't know what to do now. Do you just throw $2,000 in the trash? The warranty on this thing is completely meaningless and doesn't exist."
2,Ok for Windows laptops but doesn't work for Mac OS X,"I bought this for my Powerbook G3 Lombard running OS 10.2.8 because the USB 1.1 ports are simply too slow for transferring large files. The product specs indicate it should be plug and play for G3 or faster machines running OS X, but it doesn't do anything when I put it in. My computer recognizes that the card is in and that it's a USB card, but it says ""Unknown Vendor"" in the menu bar. When I attach a USB jump drive to the card nothing happens. I tried it on a friend's Powerbook G4 and the card caused the computer to freeze. I've also tried it on a Dell laptop running Windows 2000 and it works perfectly. I was able to transfer 100 MB of data at 2.0 speeds. So the card works, just not on Macs. I finally emailed tech support but all they could tell me was to check for any USB updates on the Apple website, and if that didn't work, to return the product to Amazon. Looks like I need to try another manufacturer ..."
5,Good Book Great Condition,"I received the book very quickly and it is in great condition, Thanks.I have started to read it, and it is very nicely laid out and very easy to understand. There is alot of info, great book. I would recommend this store to anyone. :) BZ"
3,Good,"I had high expections. This was the first time Coltrane permanently augmented his great quartet, with Rashid Ali and Pharroh Sanders. Coming off the summer of 1965, when Trane was at the apex of music itself withAscension, the excitement of an expanded band had me licking my chops.Well, the problem is not the music or the players. The problem with Meditations is the lack of synergy between Ali and Elvin Jones. Where Jones provided a swing backbone no matter how free the music got, ALi worked in free time, and the drummers here do not mesh.There is brillant music here, but with the competative thrashing, it is obscured. The drummers never took time to work out a way to work together, and this drowns the music.Still, the music here is phonominal once you get past the muddy percussion, and this is still a major work, essential to understanding the master Coltrane."
3,"An HONEST, unpretentious Review","The first track is like a giant train wreck. Perhaps that was the original intention. It gets beautiful soon after. People who say they're getting a great spiritual awakening need to reread their statements because they sound laughable. The album does get beautiful soon after which in fact saves it in my opinion. If you want those tracks without Father and the Holy Ghost, I suggest First Meditations which I also have too. :)"
1,"Oh horrible, horrible, ... most horrible.","Oh horrible, horrible, ... most horrible. Save your money unless you are absolutely tone-deaf and have no sense of rhythm -- then it is genius."
3,Not Marsh's best work but still readable.,"This is an Inspector Roderick Alleyn/Detective Fox entry. It's very late in Alleyn's career because he and his renowned artist wife, Agatha Troy, have a grown son, Ricky, who has traveled to an artist's retreat of sorts to write.Ricky mixes with the locals which include a family of equestrians. The daughter, a concupiscent gal of local popularity with all the young men, is killed in a horse-riding episode. Ricky suspects that her death may not have been an accident based upon feedback from local residents.Ricky also gets involved with a sarcastic aspiring young artist who appears to be involved in the drug trade. Subsequent to Rickey being involved in a near drowning, Alleyn and Fox show up to look into the drug allegations and the possible murder of the girl... then Rickey goes missing!The scenario here is not the most believable cozy murder that Marsh ever wrote. Still I enjoyed it and can recommend it to fans."
2,You'll root for the villains!,"I am an avid Marsh reader. I truly think she's one of the all-time greats. Her characters are delicately and consistently portrayed. Roderick Alleyn, his wife Troy, his sidekick Inspector Fox---sublime. I really love her books because each one stands alone as a sort of mini-novel: a member of the mystery genre, but with creative detail and insights that you're not usually going to find outside serious novels.Having said that: this book sucks. Ricky Alleyn is one of the most annoying and deadly stupid characters ever depicted anywhere. And since the book revolves around him, it's hard to skim the bits he's in.Skip this one and read Overture to Death instead."
3,pretty good,The speaker's performance is just fine so far. The only issue I had was that the screws inside the speaker body that are used to hold on the mounting brackets came loose. I had to disassemble the speakers and glue the screws back into place in order to install them.
2,"Look Great and ideal, However",First problem was end screw caps came loose in speaker. Made larger hole to remove and added plastic insert. That was fine even. Then after we installed and used only a few times they stopped working all together. We tested on inside stereo and out.....nothing. You get what you pay for .....not much
1,Horrid.....,Definitely one of the worst flavors of protein bars I've ever tasted. The other Atkins Advantage flavors are fine...just don't know what happened with this one. Giving it one star is being way too kind.
5,Shade Grown Organic Coffee,"Just LOVELY! The site warned it could take a while to ship, but it was here within the week! We will be ordering Christmas presents through Cafe Britt!!"
4,Good coffee,I actually messed up. I intended to order whole bean but got ground instead. The ground coffee was good but I suspect whole bean fresh ground would be better.
3,Business France Review,"This is a lite book and it was meant to be a pocketback book. The guidelines & suggestions are well written and easy to understand. Having closely with many French & American people, I found the book to be helpful and honest. Just don't expect a lot of extra words. It was also written to be read on an airplane or over lunch."
5,The coolest owner ever.,"Bill Veeck was a true maverick before that term got tossed around by crazed hockey moms/ vp wannabee's. Anyway... the story of this man who was known for sending a midget to bat in the majors and, later in life, the disco demolition fiasco in Chicago, was more than those events. He was the kind of guy who ""got it"" about pro sports. He knew that the fan should come first and that this should be fun. Aftert reading this, you'll want to give the rest of the owners, agents and prima donna athletes a copy in hope that they too will ""see the light"". The book is his autobiography of sorts that tells more about his philosophy about the game and business than it does about the facts of his life. A fun read, essential for baseball fans, about the coolest owner ever. A hall of fame read, from a hall of famer."
5,He was a fun guy!,"I read this book when I was thirteen, and read it again twenty years later. I enjoyed it both times. Spend a few hours with a man who loved baseball and is honest about being a little less than honest."
4,Veeck,"Book was fine; however, it took weeks to get to me and I paid for speedy delievery. Won't do it again!!"
4,Still on top of their game,"Although it's different from their revolutionary and classic albums of the past (""It takes a Nation..."", ""Fear of a..."", ""Yo, Bum..."") this album is as entertaining and engaging. The lyrics are honest and brutal and continue the conscious black man theme that has been part of their groups unique appeal. They come across as older, wiser rappers covering the current scene of hip-hop, politics, and current events.This is a perfect snapshot of how they see the world and what's on their mind unencumbered by the need to ""appeal"" to the masses (whatever the media means by that).Although I don't agree with everything PE stands for, I respect their opinions and enjoy their art."
3,not the best assemblage of Caballe performances,"I know that Opera d'Oro wanted to showcase Caballe in a variety of roles, but I think that this box set would have far more appeal if it had just been a ""bel canto"" set. Arabella and Madama Butterfly should have been substituted with the legendary Lucrezia Borgia, and Il Pirata. That would have made it one of the best Caballe items to own."
3,Ushering for Novices,"This book is great for those who have never stepped up to the plate before. However, there is not enough ""meat"" in there for me. This book has a lot of guide lines, but no real procedures. Also, the text sometimes doesn't flow properly with a certain phrase repeating itself through out the book. (""helps"")Personally I'd like to have read a little more concrete examples instead of what-if's. It would also have been better if the author provided Common Mistakes.This book provides a lot of first-hand knowledge that new ushers should learn, and for that I gave it 3 stars."
4,Cu Pig,"My parents thought the singing pig was cute; it had a different tune than what I heard from my friend, which I guess I was expecting them to receive the same tune; ""I'm too sexy for my shorts"" but they got the tune of ""Cupid Draw Back Your Bow"". They didn't know the difference, so the idea was cute."
5,"Very good read, even as an adult!",I loved Little Women and this book just confirms what a wonderful writer she was. Lots of hidden truths and wisdoms.
1,Poor Publisher,"I was looking forward to having my own copy of Little Men, but the copy I received from publisher Hard Press had many grammatical and spelling errors. It did not have an appealing layout, either. I should return it for a better copy of the book which I know exist."
1,not the copy I thought I was getting,"It's a story I've read many times, but I did specifically want the cover that is pictured with this item (to match the others I have in the series), and that's not what I got. Very disappointed, a complete waste of money on my part, but not worth returning by the time I pay for interational shipping."
1,Gah.,"Who else would have liked to see the ""hoyden"" (read: assertive girl) Nan punch that simpering, girly-girly little twit Bess right in her lisping mouth?"
2,Definitely not a must read,"Little Men, is an average book. The whole story is about all these little orphans. There was Nat, Demi, Tommy, Dan, Franz, Emil, Ted, and little Rob. There was more but the girls are all stupid. It's a story about a bunch of orphans that have there own little special talents. The story is really a cute little story, but lacks a sense of plot. There's no action. I really think this book is so boring I fell a sleep every 5 minutes. Don't buy this book! If you don't like action and you like all that cute [stuff] read the counterpart, Little Women. Out of a 5 star review system, I'd give this book a 2.definetly not a must read. The only part I liked was the ending. The reason I liked the ending is because it was the end and I didn't have to read it anymore."
3,Really interesting concept for learning,"This book comes after ""Little Women"", and frankly isn't as good. Love the concepts put forth in how to teach the children about schooling and more practical things, but it was very morally preachy."
1,Whats all the rave?,"I don't understand what all the rave for this book is. I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book. The book had really no plot, it rambled on and it felt like a huge run on sentence. There was a few good parts and when I started to get excited and then it made me want to throw it across the room."
5,Awesome Tale!!,The magic of youth is captured here in all its transitory and fleeting beauty and turmoil. An idyllic home in the country side is the setting for this classic that you have to read if you're between the ages of 8 and 14.
3,"The ""Brady Bunch"" of the 19th century","When a self-assured young tomboy grows up in a male-dominated society during the 1800s, she then makes up for it by becoming a cheery but eccentric ""Mother Goose"" running a broading school for young male heirs. There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."
2,Disappointing,"Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks."
5,"""Alcott, you are great""","Little Men is the funniest of all the three books. I like this book, but not as much as the Jo's Boys or Little Women. Little Men begins with 'Nat as the 1st ch. If you have seen the movie and think it is great, wait till you read the book. The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people. If you like the story of boys and girls, this is one of the books to read. If this is the Alcott's 1st book you've read, TRY ALL! ALCOTT IS THE BEST! My fav't part is the LITTLE COOKSTOVE(iron). Its so neat, and how Daisy, Nat, Demi, Dan, Emil, Tommy, and dont forget our Teddy, and Rob, standing up for each others."
2,Bad Copy of a Wonderful Book,"This is for the Kindle Edition.While I deeply love this story, and recommend it to every child, I suggest you find a different copy. This one is riddled with misspellings, confusingly incorrect pronouns and other typos. Every time there is an italicized passage of song or verse, the preceding paragraph is also italicized. It pains me to give such a wonderful piece of American literature such a bad rating, but I really wanted to warn people away from this copy."
4,Excellent Children/Young Adult Book,I read this book to do a critical analysis of it. I enjoyed the stories of the boys and all that went on in their lives. I would recommend this book to any child or young adult that is looking for an interesting and easy read.
3,Badly typeset!,The IndyPublish hardcover edition of this book is very badly typeset--I found several errors within the first chapter alone. There are letters and punctuation missing. Don't get this edition of the book if you don't want to pay $20 for missing letters!
4,A good read,"Nice to come back to this, I read Little Women as a girl and I remember having a hard time focusing on Little Men. But as an Adult I found it more enjoyable, and the stories still ring true."
3,Little Men,"Having read it as a child, I would have told you then that it was a good book, but having re-read it now, I'd say it's just ""okay"". Reading it, I feel like I'm talking to a mother whose children can do no wrong, though they often do. Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women. I honestly think the author had a much greater understanding of women then men, for how she wrote the boys. Even so, I do like the book and would recommend it to anyone who had read Little Women, but not as a standalone piece."
4,Austen's first novel,"This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read."
4,good read,"GREAT! Just what I was looking for, Thank you. Would recomend to all who are in need of this item."
4,Looks Good,"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."
2,A hard slog.,"In recent weeks my wife in rapid succesion read this book and Pride and Prejudice and then ran out to the store on a Sunday evening to pick up Mansfield Park. What a disappointment. I hit the wall about p. 20 and could never find a way to get involved. The characters were uninteresting and the situations dull, and I had to force my way to the end. I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen? Should I have tried anoter title -- Pride and Prejudice, say?"
3,Lacking,"A Jane Austen fan, I was disappointed with this book. The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me. Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in. She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such. Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book. My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead."
3,"Good....Probably Not Austen's Best, However","I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle."
3,"""Slowly & Surely""","The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty. Nevertheless, even though it is not Austen's best written work, it is still a very amiable novel and a nice light read for any classics buff."
3,A little dissapointed,"I was pretty dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because I had already read Pride and Prejudice and loved it so much that when I read S&S I found it rather long and un-eventful. All the scenes were dragged out and a lot the characters were boring and vain. Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book I've ever read, it's witty, smart and enjoyable and it's heroin Elizabeth is someone that everyone can releate to whereas Ellinor is quite pompous and boring. I wish S&S had more of a storyline like the other Jane Austen books because I truly love her books but having said that S&S is still a very good book and I'd recomend it for all Jane Austen fans. I thought the movie was very well made but a bit too long like the book but I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance as Marianne, I think she played the role very well."
5,Its a classic,This is a wonderful clasic and I was so happy to find it and it is in great condition!
2,Altogether disappointing after reading the wonderful Pride and Prejudice,"I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover."
4,S and S,"I enjoy reading about the social obligations of people in a different era and country. Jane Austen cleverly creates twists and turns for her characters, who you either love or hate, to navigate toward surprise endings."
5,Sense and Sensibility,"This book is not only beautiful, but very sturdy. It is a little stiff when you first open it, but it does loosen up as you read it. I love that the book also includes a lovely ribbon to keep your place. Very beautiful and impressed with the book cover design. I've now ordered four other Penguin Classics like this one because they are so neat! Beautiful and great reads! My only wish is that Penguin will continue to keep coming out with new ones for us to enjoy!"
4,Interesting and will read this book again,"This was my first read for this author and it is worth reading again. Contemporary for its time, this story can still place you back in time and in the minds of the characters."
5,fabulous,"I personally can't imagine anyone NOT loving Sense and Sensibility!! It is a total classic and a wonderful read, no matter if it is your first or hundredth time reading it. The added insights given in this edition just make it all the more enjoyable. I absolutely loved reading those extra bits of information! I especially loved the ""insights"" that made me laugh like this one on page 96:""Ranking our dislike: 1. Fanny; 2. John; 3. Marianne- we're growing weary of her sulking.""or this one on page 224""We'd kind of forgotten how unpleasant Fanny could be."" (with an unhappy smiley face to emphasize the point.)It almost made it feel like I was reading the book with a friend and we were chatting about it and laughing as we went.I also really enjoyed all the extra information about Jane Austen and her life and writing. The insights made a work of art even more beautiful. I highly recommend this edition of Sense and Sensibility - no matter who you are you can't help but love Jane Austen's books!"
4,"Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it.","I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled ""The Jane Austin Book Club"" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it."
5,"A wonderful, affordable edition with added features","I confess I own many editions of Jane Austen's works [individual and collected sets]. These Barnes and Noble editions are true value for money - in this instance, Sense and Sensibility is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Sense and Sensibility, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."
5,Sense & Sensibility,This was another Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book. I will shop At Amazon for everything I purchase.
5,my new favorite,"I just finished reading this book and I have fallen in love with it. Austen is funny and poignant and though the social commentaries she makes throughout this splendid novel were originally meant for the 18th century, much of what she says still holds true to some degree. The characters of the story will tug at your heart strings as you laugh out loud. Absolutley stunning!!"
4,Movie influenced my reading,"Unfortunately, this is one of those novels that depend on style to carry its weight, so after seeing the movie and discovering beforehand what was to happen, the book was a bit bland (though through no fault of the author's). Nevertheless, it was enjoyable despite young Miss Austen's profuse mistakes, which made for hard reading at times. It is amazing that Austen had the perception to write social satire at the level she did at such a young age."
2,Catching a Husband,"A long tale and not my kind of story. It was about a widow lady wanting her two marriageable age daughters find a suitable husband. All the players in the story seem to have this same pastime and providing tmes and events where it can take place. The verbage was in old English, sometimes with different meanings than today and the narrater didn't always make voice changes to distinguise who was talking. It became more interesting toward the end and I'm sure in the day it was written it was a good story."
4,"Good, strong melodic music","""Sense and Sensilibilty"" was fortunate to have Patrick Doyle as the composer. The songs are beautifully written, with strong tones. Even if you've never seen the movie, it's easy to imagine what happens in the movie when each song plays. While this CD isn't exactly car trip music, the instrumental pieces are fabulous. There are also two songs sung by soprano Jane Eaglen."
5,Sense and Sensibility,One of the classics. I just love this story. Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you.
1,Formatting doesn't work for my Kindle,"I decided to buy this instead of downloading a free version because I liked the idea of the active/live contents page, but I am disappointed. The formatting looks like it was done for a larger screen and not the Kindle I own. Every line of text flows to the end of the line and then what's left of that line flows to the next (only one or two words usually). This happens for every line in the book. It's too hard to read and annoying, so I will definitely delete this copy."
2,Dull,I found the book sentimental and boring. The characters were unbelievable; one neurotic and one naive. This book would be good for those who are vulnerable and easily swayed by the words of a woman who's obviously never had true romance.
2,i'm on board with mark twain on ms austin's work.,"i know that i am going to mangle this quote, but mark twain once said something to the effect that ""a library without any books in it would still be a pretty good library, seeing as it lacked any works by jane austin."" well, right on mr twain. i read ""sense and sensiblity"" a few years back and am still trying to recover from the near coma of boredom that it put me in. really awful and dreary stuff. i mean it. now, to be of further help, let me give you directions to the unhelpful voting button. it can be found directly below this review, over to far right hand side. it's the button with the word ""no"" on it."
4,Classic Old World,Believe it or not I had never read this book. It is the first book that I've read on my new Kindle. Glad I bought the Kindle for the convenience and glad I finally read this classic story.
3,Good story; poor format,The story is wonderful but the format leaves something to be desired. I found the numbers and quotations for the pictures distracting. What's the point if there is no link to the photo?
4,Love reading Jane Austen,"I gave this review 4 stars because at the end I get so disappointed, for I want so much more. However considering the era it's to be expected."
3,Austen's work,"Jane Austen's books do not thrill me. The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading."
5,Love,"Thank you to Jim Hart at Bethany House for providing my copy of this classic. I couldn't help but wonder how the classic might have been improved.Historical and cultural details and definitions from England's early 1800s, facts about Austen's life that enhance the storyline, as well as many other notations, conveniently interspersed along the side margins make this an easy-to-use tutorial.I suggest that Homeschoolers, students of all ages and stages would benefit by the read or rereading. As a retired high school English teacher, I would chose this edition to teach."
3,"See the movie, then read the book","Jane Austen fans are said to be most enthusiastic in their support for her writing, and after reading Sense and Sensibility, I could understand why. She was a clever lady whose shrewd insight into human nature and English society allowed her to make effective use of satire, and her plots have enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested in what is going to happen next. The dull, dirty world Austen inhabited has limited appeal to me so I can't say the book was highly attractive (which is part of the reason I ranked it with a 6.) By way of recommendation, I would encourage a viewing of the movie version to help better understand the book. Emma Thompson directed a film that I found quite pleasureable."
3,Okay,"My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 8. Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up. Not my sort of novel or subject."
5,Love Jane Austen,"My 2nd favorite Austen novel after ""Pride and Prejudice"". I bought it for my Kindle to enjoy over and over."
5,Classic.,"When two sisters appear to be deserted by the young men they had intended to marry, the stage is set for a delicious comedy of manners that not only showcases Austen's perception, humor and incomparable prose, but offers a splendid glimpse of upper and middle-class English society of the early 19th century."
2,The least liked of Jane Austin works.,I read this book years ago and forgot that I had read it. It was not enjoyable then and certainly not a enjoyable read the second time. I regret the purchase.
3,Really this is a bit boring,"To be honest, this book put me to sleep! Well, almost to sleep since I was driving as I was listening to it, afterall.Listening to the book felt like tuning into a radio from another country in a language I didn't understand. It took several chapters for me to really focus on what Ms. Harker was even saying! Her British accent is lovely, to be sure, but goodness it is difficult enough to tune in and comprehend Jane Austen's elaborate style of writing even on a good day. Ms. Harker's inflections were a bit odd. Time and time again I was shocked when a chapter was finished because it would be read something like this:""then they went to the other room (voice lilting up)......Chapter 2.""As for the story, what can be said about this Jane Austen classic? I had never read Sense and Sensibility before. Having only read Pride and Prejudice, I must admit that I found myself wishing Mr. Darcy would race in and save them all from their trifling worries."
4,Sense and Sensibility Review,"A very sweet love story for each of the two older sisters. Lots of ups and downs and twists and turns. Can sometimes be a slow read, but worth it."
4,Sense and Sensibility Review,"I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now. It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate. You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story. This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.I received a review copy via Bethany House."
5,So so beautiful...,"I am a die hard fan of Coralie Bickford-Smith's clothbound series. They are more then just a book, they are so beautiful they could decorate any bookshelf or be a present for someone special. Not to mention the fantastic stories she designs for! Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!"
5,bbok,Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!
3,Boring...but well written.,"Jane Austen delivers an interestingly romantic story of two sisters and their everchanging love lives. Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century. As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it. This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships. Although, the intriguing manner of the Dashwood girls did have me interested at times. I found myself laughing at their wit and quirky dispositions. I would recommend this book to an older audience who can appreciate a more old-fashioned style of romantic novel."
1,I hated the book,"I'm sorry the book put me to sleep, it took over a 150 pages until something interesting happened, stayed interesting for a few chapters and then got boring again. I'm sorry I thought the book was the biggest waste of trees ever. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to read the book I would have never picked it up."
4,Austen's first published work,"I've seen this in too many productions to be able to read without any preconceived impressions. This was Austen's first published work, not her best, but definitely in keeping with the themes of her later books. For Jane Austen, a lifetime of happiness is reached with a blend of equal parts sense and sensibility, pride and prejudice, and a little bit of persuasion thrown in for good measure."
2,Couldn't get past chapter 1,"Enjoyed Harwin's first book but couldn't get past page 21 in this one. The main character, Catherine, is just about the most unsociable person yet. Her interaction with family and others borders on rude and obnoxious. I enjoy a good mystery where the main character at least has a level of consideration but this just annoyed me from the get-go.Sometimes I can get past this and give the book another 30 pages but this was too much for even me. This is not to say I don't enjoy books where the primary character is rough around the edges and prickly but this was just annoying to the point of not wanting to put up with 272 pages just to see if it would get better."
5,"Depth, sincerity, beauty, originality, grace, importance","This recording is so relevant... it was a melting pot of talents working on a vision, in wich the most sincere artistic interest was present to document with notes, chords and beats a statement that's is very big and influencial, yet never pretensious or susceptible of becoming dated or even imitated.This was really a labor of love in wich one can easily forget the pure energy and magnitude of the performances, the meticulous selection of the material and the beautiful balance between structure and improvisation... very few times as flawless, pure and easy to listen as this.Haden provides here glimpses of a brilliant band leader, where it is evident the genius that touched this group of brilliant performers to produce such powerful work on an unlikely huge tapestry of concept.This is a true jazz concept album... if the term was commonplace.but with no nonsense, no gimmicks, but a lot of concept to it.Freedom music at it's best."
1,Liberation Music Orchestra CD Comments,The sample segments on the website are misleading. Virtually every cut on the CD is very dissonant... not what I would have expected from the website sampler.
1,SPONTANEOUSLY EXPLODING SINK,I would return this item except that the return period has ended. I think Amazon should refund the money from both of these sinks because one of them SPONTANEOUSLY EXPLODED in the middle of the night. My wife was afraid that the second sink would explode so I replaced both with a porcelain type. This item is dangerous and poses a health risk in the even that exploding glass cause skin lacerations. I would under no circumstances recommend this item and believe that Amazon should refund me for both of the sinks I purchased and remove this item.
3,beautiful,"The sink is beautiful in my new bathroom and I like to clean my sink every night before I go bed, but one day I noticed there are several molds inside the rubber strip. It protects glass plane from touching glass bowl. I tried to remove the rubber strip to remove the molds."
5,gold necklace,"Men's 14k Yellow Gold 4.6mm Italian Figaro Chain Necklace, 20""I really like this chain, I was suprised that you sold these chains. Its great quality and I weighed it and it was right on the spot, like it was advertised. Thank you for selling the 14k at a great price, I've looked everywhere and yours is the best! I will be back, thank you, D.H."
2,"Not from Italy, Poor Quality",This necklace was not Italian as indicated. It did not come in a wooden gift box. It was lighter in weight than listed. It did not have a smooth and polished surface. It was generally poor quality. I returned it immediately but have yet to receive my refund two weeks later.
5,WONDERFULLY INSIGHTFUL!,"I have the pleasure to have Dr. Prince as a teacher at Virginia Tech, but his book is one of the best books on Akira Kurosawa. I have been a fan of Kurosawa since I found my intrest in film at the ripe young age of 15. I have read his audiobiography, and next to that this is the only book that actually said something. It has many details not even in the biography, and insighful information on all his important works."
5,Excellent Book,As a rule I do not read novels unless they are historically relevant or tell some social story. This one does tell a story in a historical context. That is why it held my interest from the beginning to end.
2,Where's the fire?,"""Some parts of this book are so hot they can only be compared to fire."" No. I was looking for this fire but, didn't find it. A little disappointed."
5,Soccer Shorts,I live in the deep South and I wear these mainly to work in the yard. They are light weight and fit well.
2,These have a weird cut to them,I miss the old-school shadow box Umbros soccer shorts which apparently are only made these days for seven-year old girls. These shorts seemed like a good substitute and have been on my shopping list for years. I finally ordered a pair and there is a weird cut in the crotch area. The search continues.
4,Great product.,"The noly tinny coment, this is a little bit largest than I prefered this kind of shorts, but in general those are a wonderful option to play and to run, and even only to use at home"
4,Great Shorts,I am pleased with the fit and feel of these shorts. Allows for range of motion while preforming physical training exercises.
4,Code Four Athletics - Vashon Soccer shorts,"Great product. Thinner than I expected, but still good quality. They come in colors that can be hard to find locally."
1,Steps to write a book. 1. Use a photo copier 2. copy,Nothing new here. This is more or less a copy of military TM and FM publications on survival. This information is at times out of date. The illustrations are poor. I was very disapointed.
3,Useless Illustrations,This book features solid survival information with some unique tips but the illustrations only resemble pixelclouds. The guy responsible for the repro obviously did a bad job! Fortunately most pictures are copied from other military and survival manuals you might already own. The content I think is still worth buying the book.
5,"Beautiful, worth any price","Clearly this publication was a newsworthy event when it was first issued, garnering praise from the New York Times Book Review andthe Washington Post alike. Now these magnificent slipcased volumes are making news once again.Nothing else has changed about this popular monument of scholarly and publishing history and winner of the prestigious Prix Vasari in France. Matching an elegant and sophisticated text by three leading art historians with more than 700 glorious color photographs and another 854 duotones and architectural drawings, The Art of Florence immerses us in the creative life of the city that gave birth to the Renaissance.This important and uncommonly beautiful publication gracefully links the city's architecture, sculpture, and painting to its rich social fabric and dramatic political life. The Art of Florence is truly a masterpiece..."
2,Photography with Wrong Lighting,"As a coffee table book-- it is OK -- big and colorful pictures...However, I was quite disappointed.Many oil paintings in this book are photographed with flash or just wrong lighting: glare seriously degrades the contrast and saturation of the images.The indoor sculpture photographs are horizontally lit. They appear flat and illegible.The poor lighting even ruined Michelangelo's works: the highlights appear where shadows should be.The photos of outdoor sculptures are great -- they are shot with natural lighting.Regrettably this ambitious project is not that great -- and if I had a chance to see it before buying, I would not buy it."
1,A bra & skeleton for children???,"I love the idea of this book, but after buying it & studying it further, I have decided to trash it. The first page started off w/a bra draped over a skeleton, top left hand corner. This is a book for children? Not at my house."
2,Not as good as the first.,"My family has owned and LOVED the first book for 4 years now.Our sons (now ages 10 and 8 years) still look at the first book and beg us to play what our family calls ""The wacky game""(one person is ""IT"" and spots something on a page in the book while everyone else has their backs turned , and the challenge is on).When I saw this second book I thought it would be the perfect family Christmas Eve present.Boy was I WRONG!Our whole family was so dissapointed at how unchallenging the pictures where put together.We've look at it for a total of 15 mins and it's sat on the book shelf ever since.I must say that we STILL enjoy the first book and it's always under one of the boys's pillows."
1,"Look - Alikes Christmas: The More You Look, the More You See","Creative book. HOWEVER. If you want your four year old to be able to identify a decomposed body draped in a woman's lace bra and black lace garter belts along with bullets depicting a church scene, this is the book for you! I thought it was rediculous."
1,I really wanted this book,"I had every intention of buying this book for my [...] daughter. BUT when I saw the first page with the ""see inside"" feature, I was taken aback at the skull and bra. As an opening page??? Not for my young daughter. I'm disappointed, because I like Joan Steiner's books. I would buy it if those two elements were gone."
2,Halloween Skeleton?,"This book is very clever, the artist uses various objects in a 3D collage to create several Christmastime scenes: Winter Wonderland, The Nutcracker, Santa's Workshop, Grandma's Kitchen, Christmas Windows, Cathedral, Dollhouse, Toy Train, New Year's Eve. Be warned, however, that the objects themselves are not necessarily ""Christmas-like""- In the very first scene, a winter landscape, a large Halloween Skeleton is used to create the mountains-- complete with creepy-looking skull, missing teeth, etc. This is something that can be very frightening to small children and you might want to take into consideration before purchasing this book."
3,Knitting for beginners,"This is the second beginners dvd I have purchased. This video moves very quickly. There are no pauses for you to practice stitches. I like the man, he is really good. I did not understand some of what he said because he did go so fast. I really want to learn other stitches and I thought this was going to help me. It really didn't. I prefer dvd's to books because I am a visual learner. I need to see it done, not explained. I will continue my search to find dvd's to learn cable stitching and all those other really pretty ones. I have another beginners dvd that was much better than this one."
5,Poet's Market,"As a poet i was completely lost, publishing a book was not easy i didn't know where to begin and had no idea how to start. This book saved me, i found it very helpful. It has all the information you need on publishers, contacts, sites, online Submissions you name it. I think every poet shoud have this book."
4,Any Miho is good Miho,"This is a fun, chill album. Throw it on and get your house shoes on. Put the lights down low, get a drink and settle in for a good jazzy mellow time. None of the explosive jams from her Cibo Matto days, but Miho still brings the goods to this collaboration with Smokey Hormel. Don't expect Cibo Matto, because Cibo Matto this is not, but it's still very good, and worth your time."
3,OK.,"First off, I didn't realize this was written by a Brit, but other than a few changes in currency and spelling, the same techniques apply.It's a good reference book to have on the shelf, but not something I'd read straight through.Wish I had purchased something else."
3,Read it? No. But Don't Need To,"""Content is King"" was true 2 years ago. Now, spam scraper sites and the inability of Search Engines, especially Google, to identify and exclude these sites have made that untrue.Your content, no matter how good, can and will be stolen."
3,"A Complete History, at Times Biased and Tedious","There is no doubt that the Tusas' exhaustive account is factual and complete in its telling of the Nuremberg tribunal. Yet, the British authors allow an obvious bias for the decisions of the British delegation at Nuremberg to creep into many parts of the book. Perhaps this may be the result of the voluminous records retained by the British in comparison to their Allied partners (thus giving the Tusas more to write about when it came to the British effort). Whatever the reason, the Americans, French, and Russians end up (unfairly) appearing as mere bystanders.It is also worth noting that some chapters should have been simplified into a few pages; these areas can be rather cumbersome."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"While I have had a long interest in the Second World War, this book was a little too much for me. It didn't really appeal to me until chapter 8. Even then there were only three of the defendants that kept my attention: Goering, Doenitz and Speer. I did a lot of page skipping until the end, which did have a brief bio of each on the defendants. A lawyer might get more out of the general presentation. Not my cup of tea."
4,The Nuremberg Trial...,"I have to admit I have not finished this book yet. I have read other books on this subject though and its a interesting take on ""the Trials"". Its a much more international view, less American only oriented and begins at the inception of the idea of a trial. The book seems to be a very good view of the legal and international journey to the trial, the defendants attitudes and lives at the time and the proceedings.I have to admit Ive found a few things that sound a bit more like opinion ..then fact ( which most is). I question some of the word choices for descriptions of how some of the American lawyers bungled their parts or did inadequate jobs.Its not an easy read...but then most books that cover this subject wouldnt be, nor would historical subject books that arent fiction."
3,The Nuremberg Trial,"Too much behind the scene informations. Interesting up to a point, then it getsboring with information not needed to verifly what happened at the trial"
4,Good and Bad,"Very interesting book with an extreme prejudice against everything related to the United States and especially Americans. In fact had that been eliminated I would have given this a five star rating. If you can see past this major flaw I would definitely recommend the book to everyone looking to learn about the first Nuremberg trial, how it all came about, what went into having it, difficulties with conducting the trial, the trial itself, and the outcome. I did have to write myself a cheat sheet with the names, positions, and crimes of the defendants which can be easily found in the back of the book. In fact if you do choose this book I suggest you look at the back first to get a good overview of the charges and defendants, it will add greatly to your understanding."
2,realtyron,"A little hard to read and follow, allot about the procedure and trivia. Could have told the story with less words, likes to repeat and tell the same story over and over. Would not recomend."
5,Wow... give it 24 stars please.,"Heavy, deep, beautiful, spiritual, how else can you describe this music? Essential. A heartfelt and sincere sigh of gratitude and wonder for all the musicians involved in this incredible recording. You can't go wrong with Alice Coltrane. OM shanti OM."
5,"Subtly, the song of Eliot. The hyacinth girl returns. Datta.","Coltrane's harp chills, mesmerizes; modal piano poundings usher band into a breathless ether of passionate jazz. Alice is a muse and her song fills the room. Echo craving. Last night I made sweet love while listening to this: saxes, flutes, bass, and harp. And the piano frame. This isn't lily wedding music. It's its own terrain plane, gaspingly transcendent. Yearning love music, fire-driven, clairvoyant, liquid. Eros meets Caliope, Caliope meets Telemachus in the vortex of desire. Flickering candle songs, purple smoke and lace. Grace. Think ""The Waste Land""; this is the soundtrack. Unreal. ""A woman drew her long black hair out tight/And fiddled whisper music on those strings/And bats with baby faces in the violet light/Whistled and beat their wings."" I'm telling you the truth, lady. Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata. Shantih shantih shantih..."
4,Alice Coltrane,"I just like Alice. My personal opinion about Coltrane is colored by the fact that I play sax myself, but (don't get me wrong) he's is overrated.Because he was such a marvelous sax player the critics are scared to say anything bad about him -- result : for example Michael Brecker was (as a jazz player) underrated because he played also !Funk! and other ""notdaftenoughfortejazzaudience"" music but Coltrane was more of a freak on his instrument then Michael,and it was still alright !??Alice gives me just this mystic, dreamy, divine feeling that I need, without freaking, I think she was already in heaven long ago."
3,Cribbage Board,The board is what I expected. It is unfinished and may get dirty easily.Be careful how you stow the pegs; they may be difficult to remove.
2,no arrows or designated starting point,"I bought this because I liked the fact it was made in Vermont and natural. However, it is over simplified to the point of being very difficult to navigate.When I play with friends we prefer to use a board that is color coded and has directional arrows. Thus, my board is admired for its appearance, but it is not used to play the game.People have even suggested taking a Magic Marker and writing on the board.I would not buy this board again nor give it as a gift."
3,Good knife bad sheath,It's a pretty good overall knife. The problem is the sheath. The knife isn't held into the sheath very well when buttoned in. It falls out when you start to move around. I like the knife though for general cutting jobs.
5,Mendelssohn Violin Concerto,You will thoroughly enjoy this cd especially if you like classical music! This is a must have for any classical music lover. I highly recommend it!
5,Mendelssohn CD-Mendelssohn: Violin Concerto in E minor; Bruch: Violin Concerto #...,"First off, I received a great price as it was used but in very good condition. Secondly, the music issoothing and classical in the truest sense. If you have heard his work before, you won't bedisappointed."
4,Makes you appreciate hockey even more,It really is a great book that makes you want to go out and play hockey again. I found it hard to put down and it was a pretty quick read. I didnt fall asleep at all like I do with some books.
1,Author is wanted by FBI,The disbarred attorney who wrote this is evading the FBI for mail fraud and making and subscribing a false tax return. He disappeared after being indicted by a federal grand jury in 2010 on multiple fraud and tax-related charges.
2,Not very helpful,"I was recently arrested for a DUI in California and as such have been doing a lot of research on the internet to determine what plan of action I should take. This book basically spells out much of the info I have found for free on lawyers websites. I would not recommend purchasing this book, rather spend some time on Google and get as many free consultations with DUI Lawyers as possible."
3,Shouldn't Be Applied to Everyone,"This book truly expresses some valid and poignant issues and circumstances that effect hundreds of women each year in this country. However, it, like all books in its class, should NOT be applied to 'everyone'. Not every woman marries at 17 and gives up her life for her husband and 3.5 children. While it is fascinating (and probably had more validity in the 60's), and should be required reading in Psychology 201; I don't find it to be a 'harrowing triumph of the human spirit', as I have oft heard it described."
2,not that good,"This book has a lot of promise and a seemingly good message, but it does not succeed. The author is too long-winded and seems obsessed with the sexual aspect of the post-World War II American woman's problem. In my opinion she does not focus enough on the educational aspect. The book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. You could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. I found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. Basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so. However, for someone looking for a timeline of women's history in the early to mid 1900s, chapter 4 is very good."
1,None,this book makes me want to run. i have a ph.d in psychology and this book is a put down to women. i once thought of myself as a feminist...not anymore. women can have very successful careers and a loving husband and children...do not let this book fool you.
2,Not as good as everyday acts of rebellion,"I was very disappointed. I am first the title everyone knows that only women possess true mystique, second there is no reference to rebellion. Otherwise very excellent."
2,Documentation?,"I am trying to figure out why people are saying this is a well documented book. By today's academic and professional standards of documentation, this book would get an ""F"". Friedan throws out all kinds of information with no end notes whatsoever. Certainly, she references some magazine articles and studies but in no way does she cover all of her sources. She makes tons of assertions with absolutely no reference to where the information came from."
2,Sorely honest.,"This item must have been returned from sales sites as the color is off and the texture too oily. Not at all the quality of product I've bought for years. Sorry, I was disappointed also."
3,Not what I expected,"I have used Max Factor Panstik for years. This is the first I ever had to order it online because my local stores don't carry it anymore.I was not happy with this product because instead of being creamy and easy to apply, it literally pulled my skin when I tried applying it. It was very, very rough!"
5,Outstanding book packed with ideas!,"Colorwash Bargello Quilts is one of the best quilting books I've read. As a relatively new quilter with 40+ years of sewing experience, I constantly battle the color rules for garment sewing when I'm working on a quilt. Beth Williams' book has one of the easiest discussions of choosing colors for quilts that I've read. I have constructed one of the projects and look forward to doing many more. Beth's book makes the details of quiltmaking and quilting very understandable."
5,Colorwash Bargello Quilts,"great book, great service and delieveryI have yet to attempt the project yet, but it seems to be clear helpful directions"
5,Thoughtful album,I can tell this album was put together with care. Each song is well-crafted and well thought-out. As a lyricist myself - it's good to see material on the market that is of this caliber. I especially applaud the story-line of Crisis Line. Anyone who has worked on any kind of suicide line or counselling center can identify.
5,X-cellent! (Excellent!),"I listened to the samples that amazon.com had avaliable and I LOVE IT! I like the beat and Mulberry Lane sounds a lot like the Dixie Chicks. Which is good! My favorite out of all the samples would have to be Harmless. It's got the nice beat and harmony type thing going on. (hehehe) I wish they'd have the whole song to Harmless. Even though I'm not a big CD buyer (I only have one CD, Millennium! -BsB) I might think about buying this one. =)"
4,I think they are wonderful artists.,Mulberry Lane is an excellent cd. I would recommend it to anyone. I think these ladies have lot of talent and that they have worked very hard to achieve their goals and dreams and I commend them. There voices blend together enormously well. And I personally think that they are going to make it big if they stay dedicated and hardworking.
5,Must-have,"Fun, heartfelt, lively, touching music. Mulberry Lane writes from the heart--deep within. You will love their work."
4,Mulberry Lane is going to be huge!! They are so talented!!!,Mulberry Lane is very talented and I hope they will start a tour in the north-east so I can go see them.
5,This is the best!,This is one of those CDs that you can actually just let play without having to skip any of the songs. This group has an unbelievably smooth sound and great melodies. Even their lyrics are good! This is definitely one of the best CDs I've ever bought.
1,Forgettable Pop Lite,"These girls are undeniably talented and passionate. Unfortunately that rarely comes through on this album. They sound like 100 other acts, which isn't a good thing. The lyrics range from the poetic (""like a silent bullet from a smoking gun / and in a silent moment you left me stunned"") to the grammatically awful (""you don't let no one get too close"") while the the drum machines and synthesizers conspire to remove all traces of warmth from their voices. Once Mulberry Lane learns the axiom that ""less is more,"" they'll start making interesting music. As it stands, they sound like nothing more than Wilson Phillips on a bad day. Plenty of room for improvement and the talent to get there."
1,Russian language not French,It was not easy to seethe version was in russian. I returned the film and the vendor claimed he had not received it.
1,I should have believed other reviewers,"But noooo, I went ahead and bought one of these for my home office. My biggest complaint is that if you're talking on line 1, and another call comes in on line 2, the answering machine does not answer it! It lets it just ring and ring. Unacceptable."
1,DO NOT BUY DOES NOT WORK,I was in charge of finding a phone system for our small office and settled on the RCA. We were unable to hear or be heard. This system was returned and a big waist of time. I do not know how this system could be acceptable to any user.
1,What a piece of trash,"As usual, GE hides the fact that they are the real manufacturers. Wonder why that is... I bought this phone just over 3 months ago, and now it just quit working. The only thing that works, is the receiver... and I could haqve bought an $8 phone from the Dollar Store to do that.Now that I know, GE AND RCA is off my list."
3,It's OK for the price I guess,"Not bad for the money. The attendent feature is nice except that there is too much dead time after the transfer and people hang up before they actually get your VM. It says bluetooth capable, but I've read the manual three times now and still don't know how to transfer phone numbers from/to my Palm. I'm fairly good at that stuff too. I have had a few questions that I can't seem to find answers to and that's frustrating."
1,Confirmation of Inferiority,"Thanks to all you on this page. I have checked a number of other sites as well and found that this phone is universally panned. Poor base/cordless interaction, radio and other interference, poor durability. I bought 8 of these and have not opened one. I am going to save myself a lot of time and headache and return them on Monday. Thanks again for your helpful insight."
5,Every School Should Have This Book,"This book takes school teams step by step through the process of forming a behavioral support team using sound data-based decisions. If you want to build behavioral expertise in your school then this is the book you need your staff to read.Until we start thinking about the function behind the behavior and making environmental changes to make the targeted behavior no longer necessary we will not improve education. This book will walk you through the steps necessary to start making decisions that are ""proactive"" instead of ""reactive"" when thinking about changing behavior."
1,Pity the Poor Man Is Losing His Grip.,"Through thick and thin I have tried to enjoy his work.However, I honestly feel its a performance expectation gap. Initially hip,savvy,quick witted turned into a rather traditional fuddy dud.Sorry, no sparks,no mystery and painfully angry for no valid reasons. Some times writers lose their way and try to run a marathon when all they do is sprint. I suggest a writer can be both. Turn it up a couple of notches Junior. mamreed@aol.com"
5,Beautiful noise!,"Kline makes almost unimaginable sounds with orchestras consisting of dozens or even hundreds of boombox tape players. Massive waves of sliding tone clusters, voices and bells inhabit ""The Holy City of Ashtabula"" and the circle of fifths extends into infinity in the ominous ""Premonition."" ""Chant"" uses a dozen tape loops and a Robert Plant riff to emulate the sound world of Steve Reich's ""It's Gonna Rain"" gone mad in live performance, while the harmonica-crazed ""Bachman's Warbler"" is simply one of the 1990s post-minimalist classics."
1,Noise,The worst CD of any genre I've ever heard. What is it? Why is it? People pay money for this? Even druged-up you'd complain to turn it off!
3,Its Ok,"This book was OK!! It gives a reader a good account with out a lot of detail of the goings on in this time era. Although it was the 1st book I read about Cleopatra except history books, I thought it was ok!!"
4,Historical Language,"I love both historical fiction as well as not fiction. This was very interresting book but very hard one to read. It is written in old style English which gives it wonderfull authenticity yet is so hard to read. Lucky for me that the kindle has such a convenient dictionary given that English is my second language. That said, I realy liked the book and I glad I was able to finish it. I recomend it to all who are interrested history and/or world religions."
5,Wonderful!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is by that immortal writer of collie and dog books, Albert P. Terhune. It is a collection of collie stories, some about his own dogs, including the famous Lad, and some about fictional dogs. Several of the stories made me cry, and several made me laugh. This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves dogs, or just anyone who wants to read some good stories."
5,I love it!!,"This book was certainly a good find. Other than some of the stories already being featured in Terhune's other books, all of the stories were excellent. Though I love all of Terhune's book and recommend each and every one of them, this is only only book of his that I just could not put down. The stories were short, but had much variety and excitement. I recommend this book greatly, and for those unfamiliar with Terhune's work, it gives a good taste of his writing style and story themes."
4,good compilation,"While not as inclusive as it could be, ""Jamming in the House of Dread"" is nonetheless a good look at many of Big Youth's early classics, like his cover of Ray Charles' ""Hit the Road Jack,"" the great ""I Pray Thee,"" and the politically incorrect ""Every Nigger is a Star.""There are better Big Youth colections to be had, so look for one with a few more tracks on them before deciding to get this one. There is nothing wrong with this one, but you can do better."
5,Brilliant elegant performances by Marriner and ASMF,"I've had this disc for about 15 years now, but haven't listened to it in many moons. I've heard several other versions of these Mozart overtures, but none that I enjoy like this particular one with the ASMF conducted by Sir Neville Marriner. I think the sound quality is very good and weighty, just like I like it. Marriner almost always knows what he's doing, because he's the utmost professional. In short, this may be one of the best performances ever of the Mozart Overtures. Buy it used here on Amazon for just $1.60 in like new condition. That's the ultimate bargain of bargains."
2,too loose,"the joint is too loose, when i go over 30 mph, the wind pushes the mirror up against the car door"
3,Mirror is all plastic not like the original,It's ok for temporary but definitely not an original. Not even close. If you have an original it is usually adjustable anyway unless it is completely broken.
3,Not overly satisfying,The driver side mirror is a good swap in substitute but the passenger has a strange concave or convex effect to it that I can't even work out. Feels a bit like tunnel vision compared to the original (just on the passenger side).Can't argue with the price though.
4,When I Live by the Garden and Sea,Eluvium is an ambient piano-based songwriter. The style is very minimal and quite wispy. This particular release is an EP that is more of what this particular artist does best and that is ambient piano-based music. This music is hypnotic and quite beautiful.
2,not very funny....,"I bought this book hoping to read some of the short quips to my residents (I work in a nursing home) I often read them funny things I find on the internet or in readers digest. I do remember the show, and the show was quite funny, but something is definitely lost in translation. I simply found nothing in this book amusing. Trying to picture the conversations--using my imagination--made the reading more tolerable, but there was nothing I read that I would read out loud to my residents. They would certainly be sitting there with blank expressions on their face, and their thoughts would certainly be, ""and the punch line is??"" Cute, maybe. Hilarious, fall off your chair? no."
4,A little disappointed,"This book was marked as new but when I recieved it, there was dirt all over the back cover and some of the pages were bent up. For the price I suppose I couldn't expect anything else, it was only 50 cents. This will be a mother's day gift for 1 of my grandma's who recently lost her copy and absolutely loves the author and used to watch his tv show. I know she will love it regardless of cleanliness."
4,Out of the mouths of babes...,"Art Linkletter's House Party was a staple of afternoon TV in the 50s, and one of the regular features was his interviews with young children, who were candid, sometimes embarassingly so. Linkletter's favorite question was 'What did your mother tell you NOT to say?' and of course the kids would immediately spill the beans about family secrets and other taboo subjects. This book is endlessly entertaining reading for everyone who enjoys a good laugh."
1,I Agree With ACHIS.,"This cd is the first cd that I paid good money for and i actually ""THREW IT AWAY"". Nuff said."
2,not the quality i expected from one of the best sword makers on the market,"i just got my sword in, and it is definatly not what i expected. expecialy for the price. the blade seems real nice but the hilt looks used, beaten, poorly made and dirty. the ""leather"" they used, if it is even leather at all, is extreamly thin and by no means suitable for a battle ready sword."
5,Good Buy,"Well made, beautiful to look at, feels like it flows in the hand. An outstanding buy. If it was made in the West you could put another zero on the end of the price tag. I paid US $230 from Camper Safety. Too long for indoor work but definitely worth having. The steel scabbard is heavy but well made. Get a 1917 Cutlass for use inside your house because it's shorter."
5,Want to start or build a better business? READ IT!,"Being only 18 years old, you may think this is a book I wouldn't be interest in, but IT WAS GREAT! I am rereading and applying the skills I aquired in this book -- and they are PHENOMENAL!! I have started a small business which is begining to grow at amazing rates. I recommend this book for EVERYONE -- those just starting a business and those giant corporation leaders who want to outcompete everyone in his/her path"
3,Not good for small pills,It's too big for the 1/2 pill I have to give my cat everyday. It would be great for dogs though.
2,Not so hot,"The tip is rather big and is ""seperating"" so the pill falls out. It's a bit big to fit into a cat's mouth, in my opinion. We got another one and use this as a back up."
5,This is a great place to start!,"A truly engrossing book, full of classic stories and memories of recording sessions. A great primer for the new Miles fan. Check it out."
5,"14k Figaro 22"" Chain.","Great 14k yellow gold chain. Weight of this chain is approx. 39.1g. Still a great deal. If you consider buying by the gram. Which is about $12-$13USD. Per gram. Approx. 7.2mm wide. The same chain would sale for $600- $700+ in jewelry stores, and in most jewelry websites. Would recommend it 100%. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
1,Large Cross is not Large,"This items says LARGE CROSS, but if you don't read the added profile like myself, the item is only 8.75 inches high. It says that it could be placed on the wall. Yes, probably, but you are not going to see it. Disappointed."
3,good information,I bought this book to do research for a business class and it is giving some of what I needed.The book came fast and I would buy again
1,Not very sexy,"Not very sexy, a few decent stories, the rest entirely forgettable.Promises much, delivers next to nothing."
2,The band sux,I love the watch although the self winding feature causes some accuracy problems. A few minutes a week fast. The real disppointment is the band. Most of its gold tone has rubbbed off with normal wear. Whats up with that? And to make matters worse a replacement band has been impossible to find even at Seiko certified jewelers. I guess the lesson here is stay away from cheap gold tone bands.
3,OK watch with a cheap feel to it,"I love watches and I got a good deal on this watch for only 30 USD, and this is about the value it feels like. Over 50 USD you would feel scammed...The watch is OK, it is keeping time reasonably good,and the size is perfect for a normal mens wrist.Arrived on time, no issues with the seller.The main problems are the yellow color (not gold-toned!) and the extremely cheap-feel bracelet of thin flimsy steel.I don`t use it everyday, this watch can only be used as an extra-watch.So for a good price, OK, but dont expect a good quality Seiko."
2,A Morals Story,The tale is of interest as long as it stays on Esther's story. Sadly it strays onto long discourses that makes their reader wonder if the story will ever continue.
2,Too contrived,A good cast wasted on a dumb movie. The plot was too contrived. I was a little offened with the angel's womanizing behavior.
1,Yawn,"""This could never have been more than a short story if published as a writing. It's a fairly shallow premise desperately in search of a hook. I can just imagine the producers/writers sitting around figuring how to make this interesting:"
4,yay,"This is a lovely little film. While I suppose it might offend some of you religious fundamentalists out there, this is a highly enjoyable film that all normal people should see. It really makes you feel good."
5,Needs a WIDESCREEN DVD Release !!!!,This needs a SPECIAL EDITION WIDESCREEN release.This movie is a 7.5-8.0 in my book !!!A GREAT movie that has been over looked by the studios when re-releasing DVD's !!
3,Angel touches Angel,"I was especially moved by the short, but obviously meaningful relationship between Michael (Travolta) and the adorable server Anita (played by the boundlessly adorable Joey Lauren Adams). When Anita came out of the hotel room happily dancing in the early morning sun, it seemed as if something much more than sex - something wonderful and life-changing - had happened to her during her night with Michael. It was a very sweet moment in a terrific film."
3,angelic beginning,"This movie started out great, but the ending was unbearable. Also,a great cast was weakened by an extremely flawed script."
1,why is this not widescreen?,I can't believe this is not widescreen. Please make that more apparent when you're ordering something from Amazon. That's so annoying. Why are you even still selling full screen without some type of very obvious moniker? I'm extremely disappointed.
3,st michael cuts heads off.,"Ok, this is a cute and ocassionally funny movie. But why they picked St. michael the arch angel as a cig smoking lazy angel is beyond me. St. michael cuts the heads off of evil people , now that's a movie I want to see! Michael lopping off gangster heads! It would makes sense as he targets the gangstas and terrorists, child mollestors ( mollestors ruin the lives of any child they touch and they don't care at all; so they are like terrorists) and others and impales them on his sword , as he swigs a beer. But this is comedy so we got this instead. Still it's only a average comedy even with the excellent acting skills of william hurt and john travolta. So that's about it. the dvd is not well produced, sort of like the idea for this movie in someways."
5,It deserves more than 5 stars!!!,"I was reading over some of the comments for this movie... I seriously can't figure out why people seemed to dislike it! It enjoyed this movie very much..and I love it even more everytime I watch it! I never, ever get tired of seeing it. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time... there should be more movies like this!!"
1,Why not WIDESCREEN,"What is the purpose of releasing a RECENT movie on DVD and not making it available in the WIDESCREEN format?!?!?!I give the movie itself 4 1/2 stars, but the DVD version 1 star for lacking the WIDESCREEN format!"
3,angelic beginning,A good cast was flawed by a somewhat weak screenplay. The cameos by Jean Stapleton and Joey Lauren Adams were interesting though.
1,Michael dvd,"Sadly, the dvd didn't work. The seller was very responsive and took care of the issue right away. Will do business with him again."
2,Does the dog get saved?,"John Travolta is an angel sent to Earth to give William Hurt a heart, to make him fall in love with Andie McDowell. Why should that be so hard? The happy ending would dictate that Hurt falls in love with her, and if the script tells him to I'm sure he will. Hooray. Many of the scenes in this movie are pointless and rambling. The plot is so weak that it wasn't revealed til the end. What the movie was really about, as far as I could tell, was an angel bringing a dog back to life and attracting girls."
2,wow! this movie sucks,"I saw this movie when it reached the local $1 theater, and by god I still wanted my money back. Do whatever you can to avoid viewing this film. Travolta should have quit with Pulp Fiction. He must have trouble saying ""no"" to a script, because he said yes to this movie, not to mention Broken Arrow and Battlefield Earth. I also feel sorry for Andie McDowell, who was awesome in Groundhog Day, yet must now reduce her standards to films such as Michael in order to keep working. Please don't purchase this movie, I'm begging you. You'll only end up watching it more to justify the money you spent buying it."
1,This movie STINKS!!!!,"I was on the edge of my seat watching this movie...then I fell over asleep! Let me tell you something, there is absolutely, positively, definitely, NO POINT to this dumb movie. If it wasn't for the Don Henley song, this would be totally useless! How I long for the Vinnie Barbarino days after seeing Travolta embarrass himself in MICHAEL. How about a sequel, MICHAEL II: THIS TIME THERE'S A POINT!"
1,I thoroughly hated this film!,"This is without a doubt the worst film I've EVER seen. It's nothing sort of blasphemous. To have a fat and uncouth John Travolta portray the loyal Archangel Michael (whose name, by the way, means ""who is as God"") is just stupid. In the movie he drinks, smokes, leers at women and even sleeps with one. Very unangelic! Even if he does justify his actions by saying, ""I'm an angel, not a saint,"" it still dosen't make any sense. He is an angel, not a human and therefore above such behaviour. But I guess that a film about an ""angel"" falling short of perfect must somehow make people feel better about themselves. For the rest of us it's just offensive. An incredibly awful movie!"
1,Sour Meats Movie,"Once I ate bad meats that sat sour in my belly for a long time. It took many hours for the pain of the badness to get out of my body. I was sweaty and coughing with the taste of the meats in my mouth! I felt like I was to die until the meats left me (not easy - it took many days and lots of sweaty workings!). I think of this because this movie is same way. Not tricky, just sour and hard for leavings - don't watch without belly help!!!!"
3,I'm a sucker for this movie!,"Sure it's a silly fantasy story, but SO CUTE! I'm a John Travolta fan and he's adorable in this as is Andie MacDowell. The late Robert Pastorelli is also in the film and he's just so funny. Other supporting cast members such as William Hurt are terrific. I kept waiting for this to come out in Blu-ray and got tired of waiting. I really love THE MUSIC in this movie. I bought the CD and absolutely love it. It IS a chick flick but it's just so cute!"
4,Different for Travolta,"Enjoyable movie to watch. My favorite in it among many scenes is the dancing one. Oh, angel how you dance!!!!!"
4,Excellent - faith and action,"Mostly I bought this for my wife, who loves it.It has some irreverence, some cool twists, and a good ending.Fun to watch."
4,If Angels Had Feathers,"Saw the movie preview for this, missed it at the theater, this was enjoyable fantasy. My wife and I enjoyed and smiled a while, the feathered wings, and the road trip to Chicago, including the visit to the largest ball of string. We could identify with the scenes, having cruised all over Illinois, small towns. I enjoyed the part where Michael said he smote the bank. A fine word, smite, smote. Wish you could do THAT. Worth the money, will watch it again."
4,"Very good, uplifting, feel-good movie.","Whoever it was that wrote that this was not a good movie has some serious issues to deal with. It also makes me wonder what type of shoot-em-up, demented movies they have been watching to not like this movie. I felt that it was a very good movie. It had a good moral to it and was humerous as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and I also purchased this movie as soon as it came out!!! FOUR STARS FOR ""MICHAEL""!"
4,Michael,Love this movie. Good movie. Not for kids though. Sexual suggestions in it. Funny at times though. Michael is an overweight smoking angel.
5,Finding love again,I'm always a sucker for a love story. I love how Dorothy can see through Quinlan and is really keen on getting to know him. This movie is funny and musical at the same time. I'm sure you'll love this movie.
3,"Decent movie, lousy DVD","This film won't make many top-ten lists, but it had its cute moments. It was better than ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (one of Ms. Ephrom's other movies) anyway. The DVD was terrible. The picture was in full-screen instead of wide-screen, the colors weren't that great, and there seemed to be grain throughout. The sound wasn't much better. Get this on VHS for a buck if you have that choice."
5,Michael John Travolta,"Great Movie! Streaming went well, video quality is not HD but it was enjoyable to watch.I will definitely rent another movie from Amazon. We have been looking for this movie but were unable to find it until we saw it on Amazon. Thank You."
5,Real jazz,"Just great jazz, and it's enough to tell about that. Coltarne, Tyner, Garrison & Jones give you a piece of music you cannot forget. You love jazz, you love it."
4,Smooth Stuff,"Crescent is probably the most overlooked recording in John Coltrane's catalog. Released right before his landmark, A Love Supreme, Crescent was lost in that album's tidal wave wake. Athough Crescent isn't as ambitious or groundbreaking as A Love Supreme, it contains some of the tightest work of his career. Along with McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrsion, he floats through this set with grace and aplomb. Mr. Jones in particular provides some outstanding work on the drums."
5,L. Hendricks,Few albums sum the musical ideas of an instumentalist as well as Crescent does for John Coltrane. One gets the sense that all the bugs have been worked out and that this is what he wanted to say. The message is lyricism and the blues... and perhaps laughter. The rhythm section is warm and sharp. The music has the searching melencholy that is immediately recognizable as Trane. Singularly beautiful.
5,Best Coltrane ever. Period.,"Of all the magnificent peaks of John Coltrane's legacy, this one is the highest and most perfect. It should ""Crescent"", not the overrated ""Love Supreme"" or any other album, that should be considered the standard, appealing to Coltrane novices as well as the most hardcore collectors looking for musical challenges. This album is stunning from beginning to end, every track beautifully intense and urgent, yet controlled, with no flaws. ""Crescent"" may be considered by some as Coltrane's ""darkest"" collection (with the exception of one bright blues, the tone is somber), but it is in its haunting otherworldly quality that it stands apart."
5,One of his best albums,I think crescent is one of John Coltrane's five best albums. It's one of his first albums I got and I have always loved it. It was recorded in 1964 right before A love supreme and in my opinion it is as good. The best songs are Crescent and Lonnie's Lament. The songs are pretty long the longest being 11:45. If you don't have this album make shure it's the next album you get.
3,A wise choice,"First off, don't see my 3 stars and think badly of this recording. Rather than rate and compare one cd to all other cds I compare cds to other cd's by the same or similar artists. 5 stars being essential, 4 stars being great, and 3 stars being good with off-and-on greatness.To a certain extent I do consider this to be an essential recording because WISE ONE and LONNIE'S LAMENT are two of Coltrane's most affecting ballad melodies. As a whole album though I really cannot say that this is equal with the truly essential (from the first note to the last note) Coltrane recordings such as MEDITATIONS, SUN SHIP, etc...I guess what I am really saying is this... if you are looking to make your first Coltrane purchase I would point you to other cds before this one, but if you are an established fan of Coltrane then you need to add this cd to your collection, though only really for WISE ONE, LONNIE'S LAMENT, and THE DRUM THING."
3,Sloped downward,"3 1/2Crescent starts to peak early on, hinting at becoming one of Coltrane's most powerful ballad collections, but the second side feels underwritten in comparison, offering extended minimalist jamming instead of fully fleshed work."
5,Four touch downs in a single game...,These are quality shirts that will help relive your golden years when going to Polk High meant something.
3,It's not like the one Al Bundy wears,It's not like the one Al Bundy wears. My husband wanted the same one Al Bundy wears.
5,An Outstanding Children's Book,"Allison Taylor hit a homerun with her brilliant epic, ""The Future of Willow Springs Park."" This is a must read for any small child. Taylor is an up and coming children's author with fresh and innovative ideas that will stimulate your child's mind. Hurry up and order this book now while it still lasts and jump on the Allison Taylor train, because it's about to leave the station! Hats off to Ms. Taylor for a fine piece of literary genius."
2,"Ugh, how disappointing","Doesn't compare to his first kids CD, which is so much fun to listen to, especially for the kids; this selection just doesn't get my 4 yr old & 2 yr old going. My kids enjoy singing along & enjoy songs that they can relate to. Ones that are silly and they can easily understand that the song is trying to be silly. Even I was bored by the selection as I was hoping for some toe-tapping songs to sing along with. I love Lithgow, but this CD collects dust."
1,Some one is reading these reviews.,I am displease the Amazons customer service. all I'm asking is that someone help me with the matter.678 983 5360 or ericlandress@gmail.com
5,Fascinating take on master/slave interaction,"I really enjoyed this book, it has romance but it is far from a romance novel. (as a man, these are generally not my favorite...) The central theme to this novel is the interaction between slaves and slaveholders just before the Civil War. It was a rough time in American history and bad choices were made by good people. Each side is portrayed in a fair light, and there are no caricatures. The characters and their relationships develop naturally and I really began to care for them. I am anxious to find out what happens to Gus and Promise in a sequel...."
2,Boys Briefs 4,Not a DVD series Tha I really cared for. There is no Nudity in any of these short films and nothing I really grab onto to say I cared for the DVD.
5,LAW book with a difference,I bought this book to be used in my Civil Litigation class...and wow. Great price - Great value - Strong book and binding.I am now using it in my advance Civil Trial class.
5,excellent,"After waiting a while, the book was finally sent to me. I am very pleased with this purchase.Thank You."
4,Shipping took long,"Book was in superb condition very minimal highlighting. But excellent condition. However I paid for priority shipping which couldve taken 3 to 7 days I believe but I got it in 8. Everytime I wen to track my order the only status I saw was "" your item has been shipped."". Got scared but was happy when I received it."
1,Thrillville,got the wrong game and have been trying to contact the company who sent it with no reply yet. Would like to exchange it but having no luck.
1,Thrillville,we can not use this product . . . we have an xbox 360 and its an xbox product . . didn't know it wouln't work on 360. Can it be traded?
1,Xbox game,"Looks good in the package, however it does not load up on our Xbox system despite checking the disc cleanliness and multiple attempts. Very disappointed but price paid was not worth the hassle of returning item."
5,His own person!,"You may not like Don Starkell, but here is the type of guy that makes for good reading. His tunnel vision and pursuit of his goal is uncanny. Sometimes one wonders what he actually prepared for during the ten years that he spent getting ready for this world record trip. But,nevertheless, it's quite an exciting read. I wish there were more adventure books like this one out there."
5,Still a great read,"I read this about 8 yrs ago,found it in a used book store.I still think about it.A wonderful fish-eye view of a long journey with good and hard memories.The dynamics between father and sons juxtaposed with vibrant scenery make this a book you wont want to put down.Bravo!"
1,CHEAP ROTORS! JUNK!,"I don't like to re-do my work but in this case I think I will be replacing these rotors with something else. These were made in China and the casting is full of pin holes. The center of this was fully rusted in a very short time. The original rotors never got rusty in the center. I guess you get what you pay for. These are JUNK! OH, and they weren't even the AIMCO brand that I received."
3,good but nothing new,"this book is good but I felt as though I was just reading parts of other books I have already read on the subject. It was lacking in the personal touch some of the other books have had. I would have liked more info on the authors history in dealing with the problem. We merely are told that she did it without any personal accounts. Granted the info in the book can help you, though it is kind of light in content, but if I had to recommend just one book to a panic disorder sufferer, this may not be the one."
5,CHANGED MY LIFE,"I am a DJ of over a decade experience and collecting. I have listened to tens of thousands of albums and this is one of the handful that was powerful enough to actually take me by the soul and change me, helping me GROW for the better. I pull it out on special occasions in my life when things are overwhelming. This is an AMAZING album, my favorite of Pharoah's and one of my favorite of all time, of any genre. BUY BUY BUY."
5,Tribal rudimentary funk!,"Not exactly what you'd expect out of a Sanders album esp. on the avant driven Impulse label. But this album is one continuous 38-minute drive of improvised free-funk jam. What took me up within 2 minutes of this brilliant composition was Stanley Clarke's bass lines (am not sure whether Cecil McBee is grooving simultaneously) and Joe Bonner's piano. I didn't even know Stanley Clarke was part of the free-jazz scene and this is his best playing I've ever heard. Of course, as with a Sanders' late 60s/early 70s staple, there was a huge dose of free music, but in between all that melodic cacophony is a sense of structure (unlike some of this other avant-garde stuff esp. with Coltrane).Like Clarke who went on later to soul-funk-R-n-B territories, drummer Norman Connors too (a surprise again) started the free-jazz route (as finely displyed here) to eventually dwindle inR-n-B. Get this one. It's a classic in the league of ""A Love Supreme""."
1,Gnawing at my nerves,"There are so many terrible horror films being put on the shelves each day - this is one of the ilk. A complete worthless film, that lacks entertainment value - well I was going to list what it lacks, but it lacks everything, so I will save you the time. Bad actors, a weak and recycled to hell plot, weak effects... in fact there is nothing worth mentioning - Simply put - don't waste you time."
3,Fair Horror film,"I rate this about at the middle of the road level. The acting is bad and the story is simple. The only thing that saved it, if you are a fan of gore it had a few gory scenes. Overall I wouldn't want to see it again."
5,The Good Book for Bad Backs,"In 1972, I dropped my wiggly two-year-old, caught him before he hit the floor (head downward), and spent the next week lying on the floor. The exercises in this book are why I'm still walking.I've bought and given away ten copies since then.Buy this book. Read it. Believe it. Practice it. And live pain free. But don't ask your orthopedist about it. He'll dissit, because the exercises were designed by an undocumented Arab physician in the desert of Algeria."
5,Voice and Artistry,Jane Eaglen has voice and talent to spare in this recording. The progression from Wagner to Berg to Strauss is simply a feast for the listner. Don't miss this recording.
2,Just didn't do it for me...,"Like several of the other reviewers, I have many recordings of Strauss' Four Last Songs. Eaglen has a lovely instrument that is, at least as I hear it, devoid of any emotion whatsoever. She sings all the notes correctly, takes all the crescendos and diminuendos, etc., but I still don't hear any passion. I felt the same way when she sang Isolde in Chicago this past year. I sometime think she's only putting in her time, picking up her pay check, and then going home. I won't go out of my way to hear her again, either live or via recording."
2,Disappointing,"Jane Eaglen's voice lacks the kind of sensuous quality and bloom required in this repertoire. Her singing is dry and square, and is without much charm. The accompaniment is of mediocre quality."
2,Unidiomatic singing,"This album is disappointing, for Jane Eaglen's doesn't have the style, and in certain cases the voice, for these songs. Her singing is often bland and and bloodless and she doesn't possess requisite vocal heft in some of the climaxes.I don't think Eaglen is that suitable to this repertoire."
2,Uncompetitive versions,"Despite the fact that Jane Eaglen can produce some beautiful sounds, her version of the Four Last Songs is not competitive for it cannot be compared to the versions by Schwarzkopf, Janowitz or even Te Kanawa. The Wesendonck Lieders here are boringly sung. Certainly not a top recommendation."
2,Boook's condition,"This book was water- marked. Not very pleased with the condition. Also being a paperback copy, the watermark went through the entire book. Messy!"
3,"Early Perlman at his sweetest, but Ormandy sounds tired","Eugene Ormandy sold so many million recordings that any record company was happy to sign him, even in decline. After decades with Columbia, Ormandy moved to RCA and fianlly to EMI, which got the worst of the deal. As shown by the slack conducting on this Tchaikovsky violin concerto, there wasn't much energy left toward the end.Which is a shame, because the young Perlman is dazzling. He can't unleash much power under the circumstances, and the line of the music lacks thrust. Even so, for purity of tone and songful sweetness, the only recording I've heard to match this one comes from Joshua Bell on his recent CD for Sony. Many people believe that Perlman was at his best during the Seventies. I don't know enough of his recordings over the years to give an opinion, but he's certainly impressive here. If only he didn't have to swim through molasses."
3,Took two stars off because it should be priced around $7,"We received the lawnmower today. The colors are different - where it shows blue in the picture it is red, green where it shows red and tan where it shows yellow. I actually like it better as it is a tad more realistic.Yes, it is very lightweight but it looks like it will hold up pretty well. My son seems to like it. He gets bored with toys easily so I didn't want to buy a more expensive lawnmower.So overall it's OK but it should be priced around $7."
3,OK but not so great,"I expected more from this product. It is OK, but very cheap made from light plastic and it is smaller than expected. It would be OK for 1 year old but too small for two years old kid."
2,Basic toy,This product is a basic plastic toy. In my opinion it's pricey and can be found much cheaper in local stores.
2,Lawn Mower,"This lawn mower is hard for a 1.5 year old to push in grass, even mowed grass! It is also cheaply made. I feel as though if try and show her how to push it on the grass I will break it. Nothing else seemed to get good reviews either, so I guess we are stuck with this toy. Luckily it was only 11.79!"
2,Doesn't a mower mow grass?,"My son has had this mower for 2 years. The wheels fall off all the time, and he CANNOT push it in the grass. It's fine for playing indoors when he was younger, but now that he wants to ""help Daddy"" outside with the lawn, its a pain! Please consider this when looking to purchase this item."
1,Junkiest toy of all times,"This toy arrived broken. Unfortunately I did not examine it carefully, so that was my own fault, but when I did and my ability to return it was 2 days beyond the limit, I realized that this is a toy that could never hold up to any sort of toddler use. It is made of the flimsiest plastic on earth! The handle has a little mechanism that is supposed to snap it in place during operation. On mine it was ruined just from being folded (as it's supposed to) during shipping, making the toy impossible to use. Even if it had not been broken, I would have been ashamed to give such utter junk to my child! It's dime-store value. Really, it's rare that I come across something this shabbily made!"
1,Cheap construction,"I purchased this for my soon-to-be 4 year old and my 2 year old. I ordered this one instead of the Fisher Price Bubble Mower, which was more expensive. When I received it, I was so disappointed. It is so cheaply constructed. Others have said it is durable, but we'll see. I have some really tough little boys, so getting this thing to last will be a challenge. I now wish that I had paid the extra bucks for the Fisher Price."
2,Serves its purpose,"This mower upon opening was not impressive by any means. One of those items that if I would of seen it in real life I would not of got it, but it does serve it's purpose. I thought the string part was a real string, but its just a plastic part the kid can pull up on. It goes a whole 2 inches up. I was wanting a string that my kid could pull way up (like on the big mower) other than that it is ok. Cheap but hasn't broke yet. I wish I would of bought a cooler one, but oh well"
2,waste of money,"The handle is at a bad angle and my 2 year old has to have the front wheels completely off the ground in order to push it.. It is VERY Cheap looking, sounding and operating. Wish I would have gotten the more expensive ones..."
2,not worth buying,We gave this to our grandson who is 18 months old. It is cheaply made. Not what we thought it would be. I probably should of spent a little more money to get a name brand.
2,Not Great,"Felicia has a secret. She just escaped from a mental hospital, where Dr. Shanks was testing her telekinesis. He was forcing her to use her powers. Then, something horrible went wrong. Felicia couldn't control powers and she accidentally killed.She is now on the run, hitchhiking her way to safety. She ends up in Shadyside, where she volunteers to housesit. No one knows who she is.Felicia starts to make friends and possibly a new life, but then out of nowhere, she gets the note. Someone knows who she is.I flew right through this book. Nothing really exciting happens. There have been many stories about telekinesis, so the plot was nothing new. At times, it seems R.L. Stine rushed through the story. Read at your own risk."
3,This book is a thriller geared toward a mature audience.,"Reading R.L. Stine's Runnaway revealed a book geared toward a very mature audience. I don't think the grotesque details such as, ""Kristies cradled her severed arm against her chest. Andy's face looked like raw hamburger."" are necessary. These details are horrid, scarry and may offend a young audience. I believe parental discression should be advised and I don't reccommend this book to childdren under 12."
5,Kevin and His Dad,"This book is terrific for any child who can never get enough of his/her dad. Kevin gets to spend an entire day just with his dad. I especially like the way they clean house together before they enjoy the rest of their day; a trip to the park and then, a movie. The illustrations are done with such tenderness and beauty that an adult will appreciate the reading experience as much as the child."
4,Son loves it.,"My son absolutely loves this book. He thinks it looks like him and his Daddy. There aren't too many books about a son and his Dad.I don't really like how the writer repeats words on every page. IE ""next we dunk,dunk,dunk the dishes.."" but I just read it one time and its fine. Cute book."
1,clanky,it makes loud noises when you handle it. just holding it makes it squeak and putting it down on the table is almost as loud as slamming the door - only metallic.at first i tried to modify it by strategically placing some electrical tape where the metal contacts metal to soundproof it so to speak. i managed to get it maybe 4X quieter than stock but it was clear that i wasn't going to be able to get it to the level that i find acceptable so i just sent it back.
4,Gonna Have Funky Good Time,"Great stuff, Rhino has done it again! The continue to amaze with their re-issues and this one is no different. Nice packaging, liner notes and tunes. If you like the funk, you'll like this set"
4,You Know What It Is !,"I checked this box set out at my local library. And I have to admit it's one of the best box sets I've heard in years. This box set reminds me of the 4 CD set called ""Funk Box"". The different is most songs of this set are from unknown artist as well as atrist we know and love. I really like the Eddie Hazel ""California Dreaming"" and Oscar Lee Brown's ""Chicken Heads"". So if you like raw funk and soul of the late 60's into the early 70's this is your music."
5,whammer-jammer,"This is an absolutely great collection of funk and soul, many of the selections quite obscure singles or album tracks. I've been buying music since the early 70s and consider myself pretty well versed on what's been released, but collections like this make me realize I've only heard a fraction of the great music from this period. Some really excellent eye-opening tracks to be found here. Get it and start digging it!"
5,Funk--the Missing Years,"A lot of unknown nuggets to be found in this 4 CD set. The nice thing about this set is that for each dud song, and there are I'd say maybe 5-6 songs I could live without, the other songs on the set make the purchase more than worthwhile.Also of note is how music was changing in R & B, from the smooth crooning style that was still popular in the early to mid 1960's, to the funky beat and the beginnings of disco, which required, no demands nothing but an frenetic beat, without a chance to catch your breath.A worthwile purchase for your classic R&B;/Soul/Funk Collection."
3,Decent but not as good as the original,"Amazon offered these through Kraft Audio. They are a reasonable replacement, but less comfortable than the original Grado pads. The foam is stiffer and scratchier and the openings were slightly small, so difficult to mount. Also, they look a little stretched out so I'm curious about their longevity.So it goes. An inexpensive product leads to mild dissatisfaction. Behold the internet! caveat emptor."
5,Fresh CUSH,I use my Grado SR60 every day and my original set of ear pads finally disintegrated. These S-CUSH are thicker and have a better shape than the original type and fit perfectly. Nice to have fresh pads that make these great headphones very comfortable to wear.
1,Not Grado,"I received the supposedly Grado ear pads, but the ones I received (from Kraft Street Audio), were smaller, not as cushiony, and of different foam. I tried contacting Kraft Street Audio, but they did not respond. I contacted Grado, which has great customer service, and confirmed that the ones I received were not genuine Grado. So I returned them, and I will buy from a vendor that sells the real thing."
3,"An average product, but there are better","Replacement Ear Pad Foam Cushions for Sennheiser HD414 / Fits also Grado SR60 SR80 SRI-Series headphonesare a far superior product to these. These are great for a short period of time, anywhere around a year, the outer layer of foam will begin to peel off."
3,itchy for a few days,"these earpads felt very itchy and aggravating on my skin when I first took them out of the plastic bag. perhaps there is some type of chemical plastic or coating in the foam that was coming off and irritating me. however, after a few days or maybe a week, the itchiness has diminished."
4,"Great book, right price","Beyer & Holtzblatt have done an excellent job describing the process of contextual design. I'm currently implementing a new company-wide business process, in conjunction with co-workers, and thought it would simply be a good idea to both refresh my memory, gather ideas, and form concepts that would be helpful in the organizational design process. This book has undoubtedly served the purposes I've wanted it to. Again, excellent book - worth the buy."
3,"At last, a strong and flexible user-centered design method","With all the talk about user-centered design, it's a relief to find a book that describes a well-defined and flexible approach to it. The authors have really done their homework. I especially appreciated the explanation of approaching site visits as if you were an apprentice.However, I really wish this book had been more concise. I kept wanting the authors to get to the point. Perhaps I'll appreciate this book's detail later, when I'm one day deep in the throes of a project that uses some or all of this approach. But today I merely wanted to become familiar with this approach and understand its benefits."
3,Hard to Penetrate,"I have read a lot of glowing reviews about this book but I have found that, while it is good, I think it is too dense to be great. It is a very difficult read. The writing style is very heavy. I would love a one-pager of the ideas in this book. My sense is that it would read ""Watch Users."" There are better books on the subject. I like ""The Inmates are Running the Asylum."""
3,"Content good, editing bad",The Kindle edition is laden with typos and editing errors. Looks like they converted an early draft rather than something that'd been copy-edited. The content is good; but it'd be nice if the obvious errors weren't so distracting.
2,Super Dry,"I'll be honest that I've only read about 4 chapters of this book, but the formatting makes it really difficult to read. It's essentially just a wall of text with additional text boxes cutting into the main text. Sometimes the text boxes are quotes from the main text, sometimes they're important information, but they're so bland that my eye is hardly ever drawn over to look to see what it has to say. It may be important for class, but this is definitely a book that you will likely struggle to get through."
1,Useless,"This is quite a useless book about an otherwise interesting subject. The writers give redundancy and repetition new meaning as they repeat themselves by saying the same thing over and over innumerable ways.That said, the examples scattered throughout the text are the most interesting part."
1,Techniques requirement,This book provided a method to gather requirement efficiently but the rest of the method should be revised.
2,"Kinda flimsy, looks silly, fits poorly","First, I'm a big man, so this product doesn't fit me well. With the strap fully extended, it's not quite large enough for me. Secondly, I think it looks kinda silly -- the strap gets twisted easily and doesn't lay on my body flat.Maybe the leather version is more substantial than the cheaper version."
5,Music for the hart,"This is the only music I actualy listen to and I do it every day.I first had the tape, and now the CD, and I almost know all the lyrics for two of the songs from the first album."
3,"Work great, just don't get them wet!!!","We bought these so we could keep in contact with our kids at the greenbelt just down the street from our house. They worked great and the sound quality was good. Our only problem was my kids were there when the sprinklers came on, so they were playing in them. You guessed it, the unit was pretty soaked, so we let it dry out but it still doesn't work. The next pair I look for will be water resistant."
3,Interesting Ideas Repeated from Another Work,"I enjoyed Bass' book about Christian practices generally and looked forward to more in this work. While the good ideas found herein merit repetition, much of this was republished from her other practices book. Truth be told, I feel I was cheated in purchasing this work."
1,Deceiving Item - Not What Was Shipped,"Just a week and a half after my return window expires, my teacher informs me that I have the wrong textbook. The Image amazon displays is the correct image, but that is not what is shipped. Here is what is shipped, [...]Now I'm out $25 and have to order the correct book from another vendor. Very frustrated. Go to barnes and noble. they have the right book."
4,"What can I say, they are great!","This is a great buy for any Trombone player who is interested in Jazz. JJ is widely considered the greatest jazz trombone player of all time, and uses soe magnificent slide work. Kai on the other hand is great in his own right. His sweet, smooth style souds great and I personally enjoy his playing more than JJ's because I like to listen to the smoother style. All in all this is a great cd and the only thing that could make it better would be the addition of a supporting brass section in addition to the rythym which is already there."
4,A Unique Sound in Jazz,"Those of us who started listening to jazz in the 1950's will remember the unique sound produced by this legendary teaming of trombonists J.J.Johnson and Kai Winding, a combination of great technical ability and excellent taste. Neither Johnson nor Winding seeks the limelight and often it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other takes over. Add to this combination the artistry of Bill Evans on piano, Paul Chambers and Tommy Wiliams, alternating on double bass, and Roy Haynes and Arthur Taylor alternating on drums, and you have a classic recording. One that has been unavailable for many years, but now, thankfully, available at last on CD, with the original sleeve design and liner notes included."
2,Did I read the same book?,"Love civil war era books and to the extent that this includes little known facts about it, such as the cotton wagon trains to shore up funds for the south, and the actual historical accuracies of texas ranches, it is enjoyable. However as a novel, historical romance, I found it extremely lacking on character depth. Our southern belle spends the entire book trying to not-too-subtly get the overseer's son to bed her and wed her. I found her bold and brassy in her efforts. The love interest, bowie beckett, spends the book avoiding her obvious attempts to seduce him because he's ""not good enough for her"". A real creative story line. It was also short of realism. When has a band of ""banditos"" attacking a train of 10 wagons been scared off by one woman toting and shooting a gun while riding her mare!And then our belle shoots the spy/bad guy while sitting a horse with her hands tied. Sorry I just can't buy all this....This was an easy toss."
1,Misleading title,"I purchased the book because it says: ""HOW to make clients happy and do great work"". Now there is maybe one or two pages in the entire book that will explain how to deal with clients. The rest of the book is just interviews of clients, but there is no real content on how to deal with situations like what to do if a client doesn't pay, or if a client asks for something different every time. These are real problems and a book that says ""how to..."" should actually provide information on ...well...""how to..."". In a way it's inspirational, but once again, the companies as clients mentioned in the book are BIG NAMES...and 99.9% of us Graphic Designers work with the average Joe as customer. No good advice in the book sorry."
2,Very Misleading title,"The title suggests that this books provides ""guidance"" and advice on client management for graphic designers. It however, is a very long collection of conversation style stories (told via interview questions) with client and designer (all very big names at that). The books does not contain any real collection of practices, principles, and/or tactical steps one can use. There's also no real organization to the book which definitely makes it ""not a guide"". It really feels as if the author is just showing off that she knows these big designers/clients well enough to chat and have coffee."
2,the same old thing,"I was disappointed in the book. The first part of the book was good. Being new to the business end of graphic design, I was looking for was information on how to deal with clients and start building a client base. It started with good information but then switched to an advertitoral for very big successful companies. I want info on the how to build a relationship with clients, not how the big got bigger."
3,"suave, stylized mystery","As a teen-ager in upstate New York, novelist Samuel Bayer discovered the body of a murdered woman. Returning home decades later to write about the death, he finds his rakehell high-school best friend has become police chief; an anonymous killer is delivering bouquets and mocking literary critiques; and his neurotic new girlfriend-a beautiful documentary filmmaker-is secretly interviewing everyone in his unfinished book. These elements (plus kidnapping, a village idiot, Westchester gangsters, and a suicide cult), form a sleightly-joined mystery, neatly corked by a swift conclusion over champagne in a drawing room."
4,Show me the Magic!,"'Kissing the Beehive' is too, too short. At least for this fan. One thing I love about Carroll's work is his ability to create an appealing reality with likable characters and then pull the rug from beneath your feet, leaving you flat on your arse. That this doesn't happen with 'Beehive' is only a minor gripe as the writing is as ever economically beautiful. However I feel that the plot is wrapped up far too quickly, leaving me wanting more reflection from the narrator on the events that have taken place. I love the stuff on the business of writing and fandom and guess that at least some of this is self-conscious, autobiography.(really, Steve?) I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, with a special caution for Carroll devotees-don't expect the unexpected!"
5,Carroll has done it again!,"I loved this book, as I love all of Carroll's books. He is my favorite author. His imagination, intelligence and wit, not to mention fabulous characters, plots, and dialogue, consistently amaze me. Many of his books are out of print and hard to find, but every second spent searching for his books will be rewarded. Find his books and read them!"
3,Not up to h is standards,I am a big fan of the author's work but found this not quite up to his standards. It didn't have that Carroll edge to it that I find so appealing. Thoughtful and well written - maybe 4 stars for some other author.
4,not the best place to start with Jonathan Carroll,"I bought this book the moment i saw it. I'm a big fan of his work. I read this book straight thru, I didn't want to put it down. But it did leave me somewhat dissatisfied. The plot is interesting, it is typically somewhat bleak, the characterisation is generally good, except for the main female character who seemed rather sketchily drawn in. Also it felt like a book that should have been longer. The build up was good - but then it felt like he rushed to the ending rather than building up the characters / tension. After Silence felt the same too. I'd recommend any of the earlier books - but i think most of them are pretty hard to get hold of. Go for Sleeping in Flame first.."
2,"Some Good Writing, But Preposterous Plot","Kissing the Beehive starts well, but the storytelling deteriorates pretty quickly. It's a great premise for a book: a blocked writer goes home and finds the story of his career--a thirty-year-old murder mystery. But Carroll isn't able to sustain a credible storyline. Clues start arriving out of nowhere. His hero hooks up with an unstable woman (named Veronica Lake, if you can believe it) who seems to be an authorly creation rather than anything human or real. The denouement is clever, but it ultimately diminishes the book, since it's a little too neat. All in all, a disappointment."
3,okay,"This was my second Carroll book, after the fantastic Land of Laughs. It was pretty good for a while, but it got a little boring eventually and really fizzled out at the end. But I'd say it was still worth reading for his wonderful style of writing. I especially loved the interaction between Sam and his daughter in the first half of the book."
4,"Not bad, but...","I have to say the irony of the plot is amusing. Carroll is an excellent author of literature, trying to make his way into the ""mainstream"" by writing about a pulp novelist who wants to write his first ""real book"". While Kissing the Beehive is certainly more original and worthwhile than most novels, it is sub-par Jonathan Carroll and you would be better off spending time with his A Child Across the Sky or From the Teeth of Angels."
4,2/3 of cLOUDDEAD produce an album that is just that... 2/3.,"I loved this album, I still do love it. Nothing has come along like the early Anticon label sounds since they hit. This album is great, it moves from many soundscapes, merging genres and taking the listener on a journey. The only problem is that, to continue this analogy, there are too many roads and not enough stop offs. What I mean by that is that the album is a little too broken up and doesn't sit with some of the really nice sounds long enough. But I guess that's the nature of experimental music - it sometimes only lasts an instant before your inspiration takes you somewhere else. In conclusion, fantastic album, just not quite as good as cLOUDDEAD (self titled and peel sessions, Ten not so good.)"
4,Nice book!,Its a good book but Cats of Myth (another book but is about Cats instead of dogs) is a bit better! It is tales from the world abut dogs! Nice illastrations! Any animal lover (like me) Would love Dogs of myth or Cats of Myth!
1,Goddess Longline Soft Touch Bra,I did not like to product. This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape. I felt like I was wearing my grandmother's bra.
5,you get what you pay for...,"this knife came dull, and the serrated part starts half way up the knife.and the knife is unevenly cut. but i am happy with it. I've taken the plastic sheaths from inside the shoulder sheath and made it in to two separate knifes and sheaths and have given one of the knifes to a friend.(i think it is kind of psycho to carry around two daggers anyways)All you really need is a knife sharpener and you will be happy with your purchase...and since the serrated part started like half way up the blade, it shortened the length of the actual edge of the blade which makes it legal in my state =)"
5,My Favorite Shoes Period,"Disclaimer: I do not play soccer indoors or otherwise.I live in these shoes. They are comfortable, durable, and in my opinion more fashionable than the brown soled (""Classic"") Sambas. A pair usually lasts me over a year. The usual failure mode is to wear a hole right through the bottom under the ball of my foot. It is not uncommon for the rest of the shoe to still appear in tip top condition at this point. As added benefit these are made entirely out of man made materials so if you are a Vegan (which I am not) or are otherwise sensative about wearing leather these will suit you. I find that the Nubuck material ages better than leather. There is nothing unique about my size 12 feet so I cannot comment on fit other than they are comfortable for me right out of the box.EnjoyMatthew"
3,computer speakers would have been as good,"I purchased these for a 2nd room application after mounting them on the wall. First thing I noticed was the brackets were flimsy they held the speakers but a sturdier bracket would have made me more at ease. now for the sound I'm more for the quality of sound than for how loud they can go so with that being said they sounded real ""tinny"" highs worked very well but the bass in these isn't hardly noticeable and if there is any it is overshadowed by the higher audibles.I should have waited and spent a little more and bought jbl's or def tech's as I was little leery when i ordered these."
2,Pyramid 4080 Hi Performance Speaker SDyste4nj,"I received these today. I hooked them to the B post of a Sony digital receiver. They didnt work, I Undid the A posts and hooked them there. Still didnt work. Now I gotta send them back and fight the seller for a refund and wait forever for it. For refurbished, they looked new."
5,Great taste! Pure Energy!,"Tried Ultra Fuel based on suggestions by Anthony Ellis (The ""Gaining Mass"" guru) in his book. A very pleasant change from traditional energy drinks. Does not make you feel heavy or bloated nor does it give you a rush of energy followed shortly by a sharp dip (like in conventional carb drinks). Provides long-lasting energy and makes a great post-workout recovery drink. Seems harder to mix with water than conventional powders but thats probably what makes the difference!"
5,Taste delicious!,Best taste for carbohydrate drink out there. Not sure how well it works but taste's like regular juice. I recommend it to anyone
4,Out of Payne comes Love,"Though this contains her most famous Invictus hit ""Band of Gold"", other songs are from her ABC recordings. After she left Invictus, she recorded 2 albums for ABC ""Payne & Pleasure ('74)"" ""Out of Payne comes Love('75)"". Actually 8 songs on this CD are from the latter which is my favorite one of hers (only ""Run for your life"" is from the former). She showed more versatile & mature singing style, especially her jazz backgroud. You can hear the strong Jazz influence everywhere on this CD. I definitely appereciate this release though the art work is awfull and the sound quality is only so so, you will enjoy this CD if you are fan of her or you enjoy '70s Ladies of Soul or the music like Nancy Wilson's. All songs and her performance are strong, mature, sophisticated and brilliant. Get this and program your player, 8-6-9-3-7-4-2-5 which is original order of ""Out of Payne comes Love""."
5,Gounod - St. Cecilla Mass,"Who couldn,t fall in love with Barbara Hendricks. What a great piece of music. And it is one of the most enjoyable pieces I've ever sung."
2,beware,"Sorry for the silly title... no great emergency here, but somehow the pieces are wrongly labeled in the mp3 download section. What is labeled as suite no. 2 is actually suite no. 3 and vice versa. I've seen cd's w/ inaccurate mp4 information on the tracks before, so that may be what happened here."
2,Annoying!,"This is not your typical book on Egyptian religion. The author takes concepts of Egyptian religion (such as what came first, Egyptian ritual or myth) and tries to prove the author's point (at times very poorly). Other topics include: How man related to God? Consciousness of sin (yes sin)? How the Egyptians viewed fate? Etc., etc.There are two reasons why I did not like this book. The first one is due to the author's constant reference to Judaism and Christianity. I would have preferred more information on Egyptian religion than Judaism or Christianity. The second reason why I did not like this book, is constant display of Greek and Hebrew? phrases. The author (or translator) does not explain what these phrases mean or if they are from the original text he is reading from. These phrases are so consistent they become annoying."
1,No So Helpful,"The book was useless to me and very bare, I can understand why it wasn't returnable to the seller."
2,Fine,Design is reasonable and simple. Material and stitching could be stronger; wore out earlier than expected.
2,"A little old school, a little lame.","I was a huge fan of streets of rage, final fight and all those beat 'em ups, so I've always tried to find games like that. This is a little bit like but falls way short on almost all levels. You get to beat the crap out of generic baddies with a cheesy inner city plot. Gangs, betrayal, bad guys that are actually good guys and at times a bad irish accent. You can pick from a handful of run of the mill butt kickers and get some outfits and new moves. Typical stuff. Its fun but i'd probably be dissapointed if I hadn't nabbed it really cheap."
4,To,"This book combines passages from Kazantzakis's philosophical ""The Saviors of God: Spiritual exercises"" and from his travel book ""Japan-China"". He traveled to the Far East in 1935, the same year his essays were published in an Athenian newspaper.The book was reviewed for TIME magazine in 1963, and the review can be found here:[...]"
1,Bad Illustrations and Many Mistakes,"As other people have commented about the other books by Budworth: his books suffer from poor photography (hands obscuring knots, rope ends not visible) and what's much worse, just plain mistakes. I took this book out of the local library to see whether it's worth buying. It isn't. Take the Midshipman's or Tautline Hitch as an example: Budworth has it tied wrong according to every source on the Internet I could find. That's just unforgivable! I ended up buying Handbook of Knots : EXPANDED EDITION (Paperback) by Des Pawson. Excellent book."
3,Missing Tracks,"If we had the missing tracks...I'd give mssrs. Wilson & Anderson a five. Easy. The song from the ""house robbery,"" one of the best scenes in the movie, is ""Seven and Seven Is"" by Arthur Lee & LOVE (from their album ""Da Capo""); the Ramones did cover the song on ""Acid Eaters,"" but it's not the version used in BR."
4,I recommend this as great music for a road trip.,"The music is not mere soundtrack for the movie. It belies every emotion and tracks every tension that pulsates through this quirky, weird wonderful movie. I never thought I would want to hear the Proclaimers again after the overplaying of ""I would walk 1000 miles"" or whatever, but it is an explosive song when Anthony thinks he lost Inez for ever.I like the composer's Mexican, latino, or SW usa flavor of music throughout the film. It really underscores the protaganists' sense of vertigo, failure, and personal accomplishment that completes the film. I am going to buy the Rushmore Soundtrack one day..."
3,Talented but why did they pay for the song and not use it?,"I was disappointed that not all the albums songs were on the soundtrack, but the main ones are there. If you liked the movie, you'll like the cd, but I sure could've enjoyed the Rolling Stones and others that were ommited. Not to take anything away from the others..."
4,question,What is the song playing when when they are robbing his mom's house at the beginning. That song kicks.
2,Shaolin....from Oregon????,"I think this book makes an interesting read, but I seriously question the authors. As stated in a different review, the Order writes a lot of grandiose things about itself and its origin in China, but the organisation operates out of OREGON??? And I also wonder why all the pictures in the book are of the same white guys? No asians whatsoever.Before it can be proved that this is the real deal, I can't really recommend this book..."
1,Shao-Lin; GrandMaster's Text,"Waaah', Just another book loosely, historically correct about the Shao-Lin Tse'. Written by some 'white-guys',...lol, NOT Sanctioned, OR Licensed by or from Shao-Lin Tse' in China! Jie-ge' si bu hao! ""Mei Xiong - Bu Yong!"" Buyers would be better off by purchasing; The History of Shao-Lin Temple! A MUCH better, Authentic book! xie-xie Ni, Si-Fu Li Ma-Keh"
4,good book!,"It is a good book that review many aspects of shaolin kung fu, including buddhism and many other philosophical issues."
4,Indecision.....,"Indecision makes me angry and happy at the same time. Angry with the knowledge of the atrocities being committed every day by members of our culture, but happy that there is a band like indecision aware enough to transcend and fight against them. This new album is good, but I miss the lyricism and distinct originality of the previous vocalist. They put on a crraazyyy live show."
2,dont buy,"low quality, you have to rewire it to make it work with stock toyota setup. vibrations make it hard to see out of since it does not hold still"
2,What happened after The Winter Queen?,"After The Winter Queen, I was very disappointed with this sequal. More of a romance novel, the mystery doesn't even develop until about one-third of the way through. Then, it becomes a romance story/dialogue about the doldrums of Russian military camp life, occasionally punctuated by references to the actual mystery. There are only a handful of sections where the mystery figures heavily into the plot, and the story is mired down with many boring exchanges and side plots (not to mention several pointless characters). I hope Akunin writes another story like The Winter Queen, but if the rest of them come out like this, he will have at least one very disappointed reader."
1,Lost in Translation,I liked Winter Queen very much and Murder on the Leviathan not as much but this one ... Have to blame it on the translation. Looking forward to his next turkey.
2,Are You Sure This was Translated?,"I couldn't even make it 60+ pages into this book nor did I have any desire to go back and try again and again to figure out how the characters related, etc. Coupled with the fact that I know nothing about this historical timeframe nor did the author immerse with this knowledge, I just figured ""Why bother?"". I was a fan of his other books but I just found myself thinking that ""This is too much work and for what payoff?"" Basically I would read the words but not be able to enjoy. Maybe it's something to do with the translation? Oh well, I'll try again with the next book."
2,Too confusing,"Not as good as 'The Winter Queen' or even 'Murder on the Leviathan' (which I did not like all that much).Had a hard time keeping track of all the characters and military movements.I'm very disappointed, as 'The Winter Queen' was so entralling; a classic mystery if ever there was. Unfortunately, this series seems to be going precipitously down hill with each succeeding book.BUT... I hope the next one will be better."
2,So So,I was disappointed in this second book. The voice of Erast was what made the first book so enjoyable in this one he has been silenced in favor of a rather annoying shallow girl.
2,Disappointing,"Like other reviewers, having enjoyed ""Winter Queen"" and ""Leviathan"", I had looked forward to reading this. But the author has lost his touch. His detective-character, Fandorin, is absent for most of the story; when he does appear it is to deliver some ponderous speech. Instead, the main character is an uninteresting young woman.About a quarter of the way into the book (I was reading it on Kindle), there is a long and confusing digression which just slows down the action. The denouement comes not in action but in other lengthy speeches.His previous works counted as literary ""thrillers"", but there are no thrills here. I am left wondering if Akunin was instead trying to write a historical novel about the Russo-Turkish war of the late nineteenth century. If so, it fails on that count too, being far too confusing and, in fact, uninteresting.I'm giving it two stars, but that may be generous."
3,Good but not exceptional,"This is the first book of Akunin I read and I found it very good. It is essentially a spy thriller with the story built around the Russo-turkish war of 1877-78, which ended with the liberation of a great part of the Balkans (and especially Bulgaria) from the turkish yoke. One of the most dramatic moments of that war was the siege of Plevna where Osman pasha pinned down the Russian Army for 143 crucial days. Looking at those events through the eyes of a young lady who travels to Bulgaria to meet her fiance, Akunin weaves a fine story of mystery, courage and betrayal with many unexpected turns and twists untel the end. The characters are well presented, as well as the atmosphere of the era where the extreme violence in battle went hand in hand with the noble courtesy to women. A nice adventure with some dose of Balkan history."
4,detective for intelligant reader,"there are some detectives, that you read with pleasure, but immediately forget. This is not that kind of detective novel.However, there are some problems with translate. I couldn't understand, why D'Evre in original text turns into Paladin and Vereschagin - Bereschagin."
3,call your local extension service,"I have not read this book. I was planning to order it for my brother, who lost his original copy. He found it to be a wonderful resource and wanted a copy for his personal library. However, in searching for a copy for him, I discovered that it can easily be ordered through State Cooperative Extension services such as the Alabama Cooperative Extension System at Auburn University for $14.00. Some of the sellers here at Amazon are attempting to sell this book (new) for well over $100. Robbery! Please contact your local Extension or simply google the title to locate an Extension Service order form before paying such a ridiculous amount for this book!"
3,did not fit my bike.,"I have a Men's Cannondale Quick 4 and these fenders do not fit. These fenders would not fit my wife's Women's Cannondale Quick 4, either. The Cannondale Quick 4 has a mountain style geometry, and I believe that these fenders are made to fit a road style geometry. It would be helpful if this was indicated in the description."
2,"Good quality, but short fenders ineffective","I recommend getting full length fenders even if you have a bike without eyelets. If you're willing to do a minor amount of customization, you can simply use zip ties to mount to the frame. The quality of these fenders is great, but the fact that they are short means that you still get a lot of spray when over ~20mph. At high speeds spray off the top of the front wheel comes back in your face, spray off the lower back side of the front wheel hits your feet on the pedal down stroke and spray off the back wheel bounces off the seat tube and onto your inner calf. Full length fenders pretty much eliminate all those problems."
5,Surprisingly awesome fender set!,"I found similar fenders at my local bike shop for twice the price and without the splash guards at the end! When you think wrap-on fenders you have to think... ""uh... I don't know about this."" but these are truly awesome! Very attractive and surprisingly perfect! Because they are heavy-duty plastic they stay shiny-new! These are also surprisingly QUIET! I was so afraid of having rattling fenders as I ride... these make NO sound. They work fantastic! I love these! I am very happy I bought them!So, instead of just keeping them on for the winter, I plan to keep these on forever!"
4,Keeps my rear dry,I don't have enough clearance between tire and frame on my bike to use regular fenders. I had one of those fender boards that stick out the back but that didn't provide good coverage (I was still getting some spray on my back). So I decided to go with these as rain season approached. Installation is simple and doesn't require any tools and removal should be easy once the rain goes away.Two gripes- the front fender seems too short to be effective. expensive for essentially two pieces of plastic (albeit sturdy).
2,Not very useful,"I got these for my road bike that didn't have fender braze-ons. The basic problem is that because they are so small they don't completely protect you from wheel spray. i suppose they are better than nothing, but I tend to want fenders that completely protect me from road spray. Also, they have black rubber-ish pads that sit against the fork when attached. I used these on a white Look frame and the black ended up discoloring the frame - it is still there years later, even though I didn't keep these that long. Probably not a problem unless you have a light colored frame and even then you may not care, but it bothered me."
5,One of the best CDs you've never heard,"Great songs with some of the best musicians Austin has to offer backing him up. Simply one of the most skilled songwriters around. You can hear the influence of Townes, Dylan and Springsteen on almost every cut but it is not in the least bit derivative. If lyrics are your ""thing"", you owe it to yourself to check out this CD."
5,Addictive,"So, I heard Beaver first on Pandora, and finally broke down and bought the album. I can never hear ""Too Much Moonlight"" too many times. Even though he sounds like he is shackled by his own angst sometimes, he still seems like the kind of dude you want at your party to sit and laugh with about how ridiculous day to day life can be. Right on Beaver. Glad to make your (musical) acquaintance. :)"
2,even for fans this is not good,I am one of the biggest El Chicano fans.This album is not worth having.The two good songs can be found on the best of CD.However theirb first 4 albums are great.
1,dull,1. I have over 20 CD of lute music of the 15th to 18th centuries. 2. This CD was a gift. 3. The selections are monotonous and pompous and boring. 4. The engineering is uninspired. 5. The notes are `groovy' and uninformative. 6. The local 11 year old has branded this CD `sad'.
3,"Nothing bad, nothing special.","Kirchhof invariably finds interesting repertoire to entice us, but just as his jangly Bach pales next to North's, and his Weiss can't compare to Smith's, here he ends up trailing again.While this disc might be attractive to newcomers to the lute and its magical attractions, I am sure that most who are familiar with the skills and taste of the other aforementioned artists will know that plenty of the music on this disc can be found, sounding better, elsewhere.There's nothing bad about this disc, but nothing special, either."
5,PROPHETIC,"I purchased this book and it was very good.I have read alot of hal,s books but this one truely is packed with information about diverse prophetic subjects that i have studied through out the years. Hal even talk about a subject that could even be tied to biblical prophecies the dreaded y2k. The father of modern prophecies really states what the y2k is without alarming anyone and even offers hope of it. Hal lindsey & Grant R jefferey are two of the best prophetic teachers around. I truely recommend this book to any one and all that studies prophecies."
3,"Good book, could have been stronger...","This was my first, 'Lindsey' book and I can say it was good. Parts of, 'Planet Earth..' did'nt flow as smooth as other parts and u could tell it was a rush edit job. As I said this could have been a GR8 book but I can't lie, it was good but hardly perfect."
1,Read this book and get ready to hate,"I can't believe that Hal Lindsey has made such gargantuan amounts of money off the naievete of the American public. The bestseller of the 1970s indeed! Once again he takes his notes from Dallas Theological Seminary and rehashes them. Never mind all of those prophesized events that never occurred. For thirty years this guy has been encouraging hate and suspicion of our neighbors, whom we are exhorted to LOVE. He, and the religious right, encourages increased nuclear armament as being ""God's will"". How conveniently for him that he doesn't think he will be around to experience the devastation. Instead of bemoaning the state of the world and hoping for the end, why don't we encourage each other to work toward making it better? Oh, that's right, peace is just the lullaby of the Anti-Christ and NWO. Instead of demonizing one another, lets try some empathy. And also try to remember that the year 2000 is completely arbitrary."
2,A Sad Mistake,"This book, although it contains some truths, has a severe blight in it: Hal pushed the Y2K threat which came to nothing. Obviously some non-Christians are going to use that against Christians and probably have, claiming that we are gullible. I don't recommend reading this book at all, and if you are going to buy it, only get it as a warning as to why not to assume things and to have thorough evidence for what you say unless you are claiming it is an opinion."
3,"Some good information, but a dry presentation","There's a lot of very good information in this book, some useful analysis, but the writing is so dry and bland that I had a difficult time getting through the novel. If this writer only had the ability of a writer like C.S. Lewis who wrote the Screwtape letters or Brian Caldwell who wrote We All Fall Down, I think that this would be a perfect book. As it is, the information is useful, but it's a drag getting to it."
3,Too much preaching here...,"I'm new to the sport, and unlike the reviews above I was NOT all that enthralled by this book. Go read ""Rowing Against The Current"" is you want good literature. I felt Lambert was always reaching to show he knew something (or looked it up for the book) more than expressing himself. Better reads for action include ""The Amatuers"" and ""Shell Game"""
2,Disappointing How-to Treatise on Living a Self-Absorbed Life,"Though drawn to Lambert's book as an amateur sculler, I saw any value of his informative dribbles on rowing repeatedly negated by his arrogance in offering Lessons on (Leading a Self-Absorbed) Life. A disappointing sinker, unlike the comparably intended work of Richard Bode."
2,"If you are a competitive rower, don't waste you time.","Over the top and over writen! I couldn't read more than half of it. I'll never get those hours back!I know I never want him in my boat, if he talks the way he writes!"
4,Entertaining insight into the sport,"For someone who has come to the sport of rowing at a relatively late stage, Lambert offers a remarkably perceptive insight into what motivates competitive oarsmen, their fears, aspirations, joys and pain. He elucidates particularly well the different mind-set of the single sculler as against the crew oarsman, demonstrating clearly the existence of a 'sport within a sport'. There have been a number of books on rowing - it is rare and refreshing to find one written by one with journalistic skill."
4,A book for rowers & Non-rowers--Attention holder,"Not being a rower and never having been in a racing scull, I did not expect6 this book to hold my attention like it did. I had trouble laying it down. The suspense in the race which Lambert outlines so beautifully held me spellbound. The lessons in life which were outlined were beautifully phrased. I really think this book could be a best seller if it is promoted properly."
3,An overly cerebral book about a highly visceral sport,"Other readers have criticized the author for being self-centered and somewhat uninitiated. In fact, this book is much more a series of intellectual/autobiographical essays than it is a book about rowing. This book is cerebral in exactly the way that rowing is not. In a way, Lambert's approach resembles the overthinking that many rowers have to conquer in order to compete well. As a portrait of the sport, it is mediocre, or worse. As a Montaigne-like series of essays which uses rowing as a metaphor, it succeeds fairly well. My guess is that people who enjoy personal essays will enjoy this book; serious rowers looking for a book about rowing will often find it unsatisfying."
2,Mind over water Lessons on life from the art of rowing,"Craig Lambert's Book 'Mind over water: Lessons on life from the art of rowing' attempts to explain how rowing can be a metaphor for life. 'attempts' being the key word there. Being a rower myself, I found that his ideas were so far fetched and in some cases I had no idea how they related to both life and the sport of rowing that we both share. I had to skip over many of the parts that were wordy, and it seems many of the paragraphs could be re-written to be half the length. I am not an english Major, but I did notice that he Author has not organized his thoughts very well. I found that one idea many times did not follow the next. Lambert included some unecessary bits of information such as where he played as a child, and much about his career as an adult. As much as I disliked Craig Lambert's book, he did at least use the correct rowing terminology. But all in all I would not reccomend ambert's book to my fellow crewmates."
1,For Beginners Only,"Lambert's account of rowing, though seemingly poetic to the uninitiated, will dissappoint any avid rower for its sheer lack of ""having been there"" sentiment. The book is Lambert's chance to spout off about the magic that he sees in rowing and how lessons learned in the sport can be applied universally to any challenge in life. If you can look past his arrogance, without hesitation I recommend the book to non-rowers or novices who will see Lambert's lessons for what they are worth. But I strongly warn off any experienced or competitive rowers because you will be disgusted by Lambert's butchery of the sport. Try The Amatures instead."
1,not for athlete,"This will be a short review. To use an example visit the sample extract that is offered on this web site. The author mentions a double head. He builds it up as something mythic and impossible. This is a joke. Six miles is nothing. Just nothing. Its a warm up for some. Sports writing is not easy but effort should be made to represent the true hardships of a sport, because if you fake it you also fake the joy that can be derived from the sport. Rowing is tough and you learn a lot about yourself from it but limiting it to oh its really cold in the morning and the hagiographies of US olympians is boring and misguided. I suggest Lambert visit a few more boat clubs."
4,Game Boy cable Link,"Bought this cable link a long time ago for my Kids, very funny and they loved it, played a lot of times, it was definitely worth it."
3,Seconding Russ,"When I listened to this piece for the first few times I came away with the same impression that the commentator Russ had, which was that, although it had some interesting aspects to it, the overall effect was a mess and the ending sounded very derivative of Scriabin's ""Poem of Ecstasy."" However, since then I've been drawn to listen to this several more times, and the more I listen to it the more I appreciate the overall construction. It's very unusual, but the symphony does have a coherent story to it, and once one can figure it out it becomes easier to see how all of the interesting parts fit together. Having this impression now, I'd probably give this work four stars."
4,"More heart, but less fire than embers","If you like New Flamenco (or Nouveau Flamenco, as it's also called) this is a good CD to have in your collection. But the title ""Gypsy Fire"" ought to really be ""Gypsy Embers"" as many of the pieces are more contemplative than rousing. Not a bad thing in a guitar CD, but this is definitely not hot dance music.My favorite cuts were the last two, ""Tormenta de Fuego"" by Ruben Romero and Lydia Torea, and ""Moonlight Dance"" by James Bobchak. These aren't sampled here, but the samples provided do give a good idea of the more mellow tone of this CD. What's also nice is the selection of artists, from Oscar Lopez, to Ottmar Liebert, Miguel de la Bastide from Canada, and of course Jesse Cook, whom I think is my favorite, though really it's hard to choose. If you like New Flamenco, you will probably enjoy this CD sampler."
2,not worthwhile,"""Tormenta de Fuego"" by Ruben Romero and Lydia Torea is the only stand-out cut. The rest is bottom of the barrel, boring stuff, not even worth $6 I paid for it.There are plenty of other Flamenco collections much better than this.I say skip it."
3,gypsyfire disappointment,"I had an original gypsy fire cd and loved it and unfortunately lost it. My wonderful partner found one to replace it. Many of the cuts are the same on both, but some have been dropped or replaced and are not nearly as exciting as the original; somewhat disappointing, although better than not having them at all!"
3,not that clean,not what I expected I thought with a name like Freud the cut would be clean and crisp not so. Epect to do some sanding.
2,Everything was good except....,"Yes, the book arrived in good time. Content is as expected, simple, precise and informative.The problem is our copy. It's pages are beginning to separate and fall out as we read it. By nowit's much too much hassle to return it. Who's to blame? I don't know, but the binding is inferiorand the book will be ready for the trash as we read each page and it falls to the ground."
4,Very informative,I have read several books in preparing for my new herd. This one gave me what I believe to be the best and easiest information.
2,Sheep stories - little else.,"The basic premise of this book is, if you like sheep you can buy some from a neighbor or friend - pg.6 - which contradicts the sub title, ""everything you need to know."" The exception being HOW TO BUY SHEEP other than neighbors or friends. A better title/descriptor of this novella might be, In Vermont we buy our sheep from friends and this is how much fun you can have with them! There is some basic info about what this guy does with his sheep. Scant info about breed specifics and veternary concerns."
5,A great read for those thinking of getting sheep,"We purchased this book because we are thinking of buying a farm and having sheep, amongst other animals. This book is enjoyable to read and full of great information. It is helpful to learn from the mistakes of others so you do not have to suffer the same learning pains. Like I said before, this book is not just informative but a pleasure to read which is not true for other books like this. Also, there are some wonderful photos. They author and photographer clearly enjoy what they are doing and pass that feeling on to the reader. We would highly recommend getting this book if you are interested in getting sheep."
4,Great read for beging sheepherd,"This is a very good book to read. It covers most of the areas you need to think about. My ownly criticism is that the authors only used Northeast farms for pictures and etc. I think if they had included more information about southern and western conditions and pictures it would have been a more complete book. ie, Florida grasses are totally different from NE grasses."
1,Disappointing,"This book is not for farmers, nor is it written by farmers. The author recommends hiring someone to build fences and has never butchered their own animals."
5,Finally! A sheep book that tells you what you need to know!!!,"This book is great for beginner shepherds. I've read just about every book about raising sheep that I could find, and most of them just scare the crap out of you when you see all of the diseases they can get. Chuck Wooster puts it all in perspective and tells you all of the things that you really need to pay attention to, from feed to fencing. All done marvelously with a sense of humor. More than once I laughed out loud while reading about the author's experiences with sheep. I've been a shepherd for about a month now and I can tell you I've referred to his book more than all of the others. Raising sheep is a joy, and Chuck Woosters book is a joy to read."
5,What a great book,"If you are a newcomer to living on a small farm and are looking for information on livestock to keep on your small acreage, this is a great book.The author is very detailed yet understandable about every aspect of sheep raising and care.It is also written for people from every angle. If you want to raise your own lambs and slaughter them or, like me, you don't want to use them for any other purpose other than as pets who keep the lawn down, this is just the book for you. The author covers everything you will need and makes you look forward to getting your first flock.Really enjoyed it."
1,It's awful and boring.,"Don't waste your time, or your money, on this film unless you are a total Bonnie & Clyde completest, Dracula completest, so and so vs. so and so completest, etc. Yes, the young woman the plays Bonnie is a total hottie; perhaps the film's only redeeming factor, but not worth the price. It's just plain stupid. Personally, I'd like to get a refund, but the seller was not at fault. I'm going to sell it here - ""Like New-viewed once and once only!"""
2,not what I expected,"Because of the title, I expected a clever exposition on current Buddhist practices that lack the most important aspect of Buddha's teaching, namely sense introversion. The author's focus, however, is on the physical discomforts at Wat Pah Nanachat in Thailand and the all-too-human faults that commonly arise in groups of people gathered for whatever reason, even a 'higher purpose'. Kind of interesting for readers that may not expect such goings on in ashram life. For those interested in techniques of sense introversion, see God Without Religion."
4,Sharing a Young Man's explorations into another world,"Tim Ward's What the Buddha Never Taught told the story of Tim Ward who as a young man had his lens to the world cracked when exposed to other cultures, philosphies and religions. Courageously with an open mind and young man's courage and curiosity, he set out to learn more. Through his mastery of observation and description, Ward brings the reader along, experiencing the ups and downs from the mystic moments to mosquitos. The result is enthralling , intriquing and enlightening."
2,Only Interesting,"""What the Buddha Never Taught"" is not unbearable, especially if the reader has some interest in Thai monastic life, but the author's glibness suggests that perhaps he was more interested in contriving an interesting story than learning what the Buddha really taught."
3,STRONG smell,"This stuff works great as a shower gel or for bubble bath - it's thick and leaves your skin soft. However, its smell is VERY strong. This particular kind (pink bottle) smells like men's cologne. The smell will stay on your skin for a while, so if you're a woman (or are getting this for your child to use in baths), consider opting for a different scent."
4,Expensive but worth it,My mother loves this product so I buy it as a gift for her. It's a bit on the pricey side but worth it.
5,FABULOUS!!!,"This product is THE BEST. I've been using it for years. I'm consistently trying other products that my friends recommend or that I see out in the shops and, hands down, this one beats all of them. I have been living internationally and have tried everything abroad also and still - nothing comes close to this product. The smell is beautiful, it does not go away, it makes a zillion bubbles in a bath or just cleans away everything and leaves you fresh and clean all day."
5,Love it!,"Wonderful for sensitive skin. Not only do I use it instead of soap in the shower; I also use it on my 3 year old, and he has the softest, most wonderful smelling skin. I'm sure he won't want to use it when he's older (it's pretty 'girly' smelling) - but for now, I'll keep using it on him and me. I love Vitabath!"
4,"Love it, but...","Love Vitabath Moisturizing shower gelee and have used it for years. I like the fragrance and the feel of it on my skin. My only problem with the product is that it has paraben, which I'm trying to avoid using since it's been found to be carcinogenic. That said, I haven't stopped using my Vitabath, but don't use it every day and alternate it with a paraban-free bath gel."
1,What happened to my favorite Pink Vitabath???,Nothing else compares!!! Does anyone know why they discontinued it??? It was a Very sad day when I couldn't find it anywhere!
3,Culligan HF-360 Whole House Sediment Filter Clear Housing,Great filter but comes without a mounting bracket. Nearly impossible to mount this filter without a backet.had some problems getting the leaks to stop
1,Leaks,"I should have listened to other reviews. This filter housing leaked since day one (usually a drip here and there, or right after changing the filter), but it just recently began leaking about 1 gallon a day (after using it for about 9 months). The leak is coming from somewhere in the valve. I'm going to try the fix that another reviewer posted (about the silicone). Crossing fingers that this works!"
2,would not stop leaking from bowl,"I purchased one of the Culligan HF-360, clear housing filters. When I first installed it, it dribbled water between the housing and the top. I then try tightening it more. It slowed a bit, but stilled leaked. I decided not to worry about a small leak. Seeing that the filter was dirty, I went to change the element. In doing so, it was on so tight that the entire pvc pipe snapped in two. I repaired the pipe, but did not put the filter back in, for fear that this would happen again. I am still looking for a clear housing filter that will be water tight without having to crank it down so hard."
5,Great filter,Works just exactly like it should and easy to install. The filter itself should last for thousands of gallons as I only filter for sediment.
3,Sediment water filter works great if not for the air release button falling out during filtration,I used this filter to filter home made beer. It filtered the beer just fine but there was a glitch. The air release button fell out of the apparatus during filtration. I got it back in but it wasn't easy. Beware of this!
2,Do not use outside,"I've got two of these, one is clear and the other is solid blue plastic. They are both outside connected to my well. The clear model is NOT for outdoor use. Because it is clear, algae starts to grow quickly until it covers the where the sunlight enters the unit. I had to spray paint it black to keep the algae from growing and the spots I missed with the paint still grew algae. On top of this issue, it developed a leak 9 months after I installed it. I finally scrapped it and bought another blue one."
1,Fragil,"La pieza superior que gira y permite cerrar el agua y cambiar el filtro es muy frágil y se rompe fácilmente. Al cambiar mi primer filtro a los seis meses, la cerré y se atascó. Cuando desarmé el mecanismo ví que tiene un pin plástico que se rompe fácilmente y la hace inservible. Era mejor cuando no tenía esa pieza. Además de que es innecesaria porque uno siempre debe instalar una llave de paso antes del filtro."
3,"Good product, but misleading description","I would rate the product itself with 5 stars. Unfortunately, all I was looking for was the filter ""insert"" and opened the box to find that I'd bought the entire water filter housing unit, the wrench and the insert. So... a note of caution to anyone else who doesnt know the difference. Other than that, it is a great product, good instructions."
4,Keep it warm,"I purchased this filter to use only for filling my hot tub. The temp dropped below freezing and the bottom housing shattered like someone dropped a grenade in it even though it was empty at the time! My fault. The precautions specifically state to it must be protected against freezing. I went to manufactures site to order a replacement housing but after shipping costs, I discovered I could order the whole unit from Amazon for $3 more. I also noted that the manufacturer recommends replacing the bottom housing every 5 years for the clear housing and very ten years for the opaque housing."
3,No Mounting Bracket,Great filter but comes without a mounting bracket. Nearly impossible to mount this filter without a backet. Either buy a mounting bracket for this filter or buy a different brand filter.
3,Works... watch for leaks - you can fix the leak,"This filter seems to work OK. Its fairly new yet.Install was simple enough.But when I turned the water on it had a slow leak around the handle at the top (not between the clear body and the blue top)... since I had it hard plumbed into my system I didn't want to take it off. I turned the water off and did some investigating and under the handle there are 4 screws. I took those out and there is an O-ring around the handle interior. I put a bunch of plumbing silicone grease on the o-ring, reassembled it, and the leak was FIXED.So be advised... If you get a leak coming under the handle you can fix it. Just be sure to turn the water off first!I downgraded the product to 3 stars since I had to fix it. Now it seems to work OK."
1,Leaks,Ordered two of these with the same results. They leak from the top where the bypass valve enters the unit. Had to return them. I went and purchased a GE equivalent that works perfect.
3,Installation Caution!,"Caution !! When hooking this up, be very careful how much you tighten the inlet side. It cracks easily. My husband use a 6"" pair of pliers to tighten it up, and it cracked it. Now I have to buy another one, because I had already bought extra filters."
2,It's all relative,"Currently have one installed (on outlet from water heater, to trap scale -- !) by plumber. Always a pain to change filter: cannot unscrew canister w/o threatening to break pipes, so have to remove the whole unit and get it down on the floor and use two arms and a leg to remove the canister. Developed a slow leak around the canister threads (6-7 years old?) and now a fast leak from the top valve, so I guess I'll replace with the same model -- cause you should read the reviews on the Whirlpool equivalent. At least the canister hasn't exploded on this one yet. (Wish I could find the type -- unknown, no manufacturer id -- on our inlet lines: 15 years, never a problem, and easy to change filters.)"
1,Leaked right out of the box,"I replaced a leaking water filter with this one. The old one started leaking around the pipe fittings (after five years without a problem). I could not get the old one to stop leaking so I got this Culligan unit, which is very similar, to replace it. Well, this one leaked from where the clear housing screws into the main housing, where the gasket is. I removed the clear housing several times, made sure the gasket was seated correctly, and basically followed all the instructions to the letter, but could not get this one to stop leaking at all. It went back the next day."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with the content of this video. I have taught forgiveness in Liberia, West Africa. I was planning to take this video with me on my next trip to Liberia. However, I will not be taking this video with me to Liberia because the video has very little content regarding forgiveness."
4,This is a wonderful recording.,"I was discouraged to read the first two reviews of this. I think this is a brilliant recording of ""The Seasons"". Perlman is a master of the violin and this recording proves that. My favorite is summer he plays it with such passion and artistry. This is one of the best recordings of this piece I've ever heard. I am happy with the recording and I listen to it as often I can. It is magnificent."
3,Buy the Mutter CD instead,"This is an amazing recording; ""The Four Seasons"" is an amazing piece: you can't go wrong. The problem is that Perlman rushes throught it all, rather than savoring it, making it harder to hear. The result is ""sparkling"" rather than ""scintillating"". Of course, if you just listen to it, you will hear both glory and beauty; how can the brilliant first movement of ""Spring"" be played in any way less than totally passionate? In the second movement of ""Winter"" you can nearly see the icicles melting outside the window or the blazing fire; that's how it was written. In some points it is even better than the Mutter disc, because she has so much dynamic control that it is almost impossible to find a volume level at which the soft parts are audible but the loud parts aren't deafening. I think Perlman intended you to just sit back and relax, and figure out all of the things by yourself."
2,poor condition,This book was musty and I am still airing it out before I read it. Very disappointed in the conditon of the book.
1,Not what I thought,I actually returned this book after looking at the models who were demonstrating the different moves. They were not very motivating. They looked fat and unfit! I think there are better fitness books out there.
4,Great book for weightloss,"Great workout book for women who are trying to lose weight through weight traiing. It's a good educational guide to help target all the right muscles within a female's body, and provides a good number of exercises to target those muscle areasI highly recommend it!!!"
2,A Critic,"First of all, I'd just like to ask why a man is the expert on women's health and fitness. He's certainly knowledgeable, but a woman's perspective might seem more valuable. More importantly, though, the reason a woman's self-confidence is affected every time she looks in the mirror (as the book's description claims is the case) is becuase our society mandates a ridiculously strict and unrealistic standard of beauty. How about a fitness book that emphasizes the fact that people come in all shapes and sizes and that a woman doesn't have to resemble a model to be beautiful--clothed or naked. That would be truly positive and beneficial for women to realize. Perhaps we should all spend 15 minutes a day looking in the mirror and assuring ourselves that we're beautiful and attractive even if we're not super skinny with toned legs and a six-pack."
1,Improper Information,"I think it would better serve your customers to inform potential buyers that this book is for women who go to the gym on a regular basis, and not for those who were expecting to use this book to work out at home. I would not have wasted time and money had this IMPORTANT information been provided."
2,Focus on Exercising with EQUIPMENT,"I ordered this book based on reviews from health and fitness websites and the online reviews. The reviews indicated (or I assumed) I could do these exercises at home! I am very interested in weight Training exercises. Perhaps it was my wrong assumption, but I assumed the exercises used free weights and floor exercises. 90% of the exercises were based on going to a gym or having gym equipment (I do own an elliptical). I was disappointed and returned the book! So the motto is, if you don't have access to gym equipment don't waste your time!"
5,A Unique Workout,"This book has been very helpful to me in creating an exercise program. I had reached a plateau in my workout and wasn't making progress. The book explains why certain combinations of exercises are better than others. How working muscles from different angles promotes better development. This has been a revelation to me. By using the exercises in the suggested combinations, I have seen almost instant improvement in my body. I am so happy with the progress that I've made on the program and would recommend the book to anyone who is serious about getting into shape."
2,I was disappointed,"The introduction says that you can do the exercises at home with weights and a bench but when you actually look at the exercises, most of them are done on machines from a gym. Very disappointing."
1,An Attempt to Make a Quick Buck,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is extremely elementary and I seriously doubt if the author even wrote it. It resembles a collection of fitness magazine articles thrown together in an attempt to publish something; it's basically a superficial work.It's true that there aren't many intelligent individuals in the fitness industry, and unfortunately, this writing reinforces that truism. I'm sorry I bought the book."
1,Reviews Were No Help At All,"I wish the previous reviewers had mentioned that this recording of Bartok's Second Violin Concerto has the original ending, and not the amazing final cadenza which is the highlight of the whole piece.(That information would have saved me nineteen bucks!)And though I am not a psychiatrist, I say that any violinist would have to be insane to want to omit that final cadenza.Viktoria (sic), please seek professional help."
4,challenging and enjoyable,I am generally a fan of romantic era music. I borrowed this from the library and liked it more than I expected I would given its modernist composers. Both pieces are spiky and harmonically challenging and would not be enjoyable for those intolerant of all dissonance. The playing is really good. I liked the sharpness of the solo violin and the quality of her vibrato-- varies some depending on the ongoing content and shifting mood. The Bartok piece with its three movement lay-out is perhaps the more traditional of the two in general outline but I found its harmonies just a bit more difficult. The mix favors the soloist but LA provides good color. The sound is good.
4,A lot of talent,This is a very nice Cd with a huge amount of talent. Nice selection of tunes and very well edited. Well worth the purchase!
1,Buyer BEWARE!,"Seller uses bait and switch on this product. The single tube price of $5.99 becomes unavailable at check out and what remains as your only option is a 'bundle of three' pricing for $25.99. But this is the clincher.... There is no 'bundle of three' Buyer will be sent three individually packaged tubes of mascara at the higher 'bundle of three' price. Should you contact the seller, you will be told that the single priced packages just fly out of stock faster than they can be replenished. But then how can they send 3 individual packages of mascara at the higher 'bundle of three' pricing? Seller is very courteous when contacted but you'll never get an answer to the mystery."
4,Love it.,"I hate mascara shopping! Can never find a true brown. A friend told me about this one, in deep auburn. It goes great with my strawberry blonde hair. They quit selling it around here, so I'm glad to see Amazon has it. And, it actually has a real brush, not those plastic things!"
4,Great piece of academic work,"This book helped me understand my initial international relations module at college. It is concise, informative and provides detailed analysis of key issues, and sets out typologies on how best to understand international issues."
3,I liked the Octet recording better,"This is a good recording, but I was more impressed with this ensembles' recording of the Octet.I am inclined to recommend Hausmusik London recording of this piece over this one."
3,Supplement to the 7th Edition!,"I had bought this book thinking it was the 7th edition not the supplement to the 7th edition, title is misleading. I would recommend using ISBN for future purchases, I will try it this way and see what happens. Book, however, is educational. I prefer the longer edition though."
4,"Good Resource, Wrong Title","While this book is a great resource for helping students evaluate and analyze text, I did not get exactly what I was looking for because the title listed on Amazon does not match the book. The title on Amazon says A to Zoo: (Children's and Young Adult Literature Reference), 7th Edition, which is the book I wanted. However, the actual book available is the ""Supplement to the 7th Edition"". So, I had to go elsewhere to find the 7th edition."
2,NOT AS TITLE INDICATES,"BUYER BEWARE - this is a supplement to the 7th edition, not the full item as title in search indicates. Mine came in the mail and I was so disappointed I went back and looked to see if I had made a mistake, but I hadn't. The cover of the item is the ONLY place one would see that this is a supplement. Quite misleading!"
1,Broken the day after Christmas,"I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one. Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great. It really did send goosebumps down my spine. THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short."
3,"OK, but fragile",Lasting space age materials=cheap plastic construction. Take care of it and should serve you fine.
3,as a head massager 1* but as a vibrator 5*****,"this is just a vibrator with a funny hat for a disguise!! lol really tho.... as a scalp massager i dont recommend it, but for more personal massaging go for it! :) GIGGITY!!"
1,Feels great but...,"This product feels amazing. However, the base split in half the second time it was used. It's still usable but it doesn't feel the same nor does it work as well. :( I was very disappointed as this was a gift for someone very special"
2,Fragile,"Manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs, as this device is very fragile. Not a good consumer product."
3,Metal version is better,I've had the metal version before and I thought this just didn't compare since the finger are more spread out on the plastic version and there is no way to adjust them either.
1,Not recommended,Item does not work properly. The turn nob on it does not turn it on. I have to beat on the end of it to get it to come on.
1,no good for people with small heads,"might have been nice, but just went over my cheeks. No one at else at work wanted it, so I threw it out. too bad. The ones with metal wires are adjustable. Vibrating unit was just fine. Too bad!"
1,Dead on arrival,"I bought this last November but did not open it until today. When I turned it on after inserting the battery, I assumed that the failure was attributable to a dead battery. I tried 2 new ones to no avail.BAD!"
1,Straight to trash,"never could turn on, plastic prongs promptly broke on 1st use.if it wasnt so inexpensive I would have packed and returned,instead...STRAIGHT TO TRASH!!"
1,Poor construction,"The designer of this product seemed more interested in packaging, shipping and storage of this product that the use of it. The ""prongs"" are made of some sort of cheap plastic that enables the product to be packaged using less space because the prongs come disassembled. I had mine a week and the first prong broke - a week later another prong broke. I glued them but the break was in a place that would not hold. I would not recommend buying this product."
2,WARNING,"It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator! I'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind; I'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind. Once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck, the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator. Just be forewarned, customers, this item is not for the easily offended."
2,Among the long-winded,"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia. It is what it is, but it's definitely not my favorite."
4,I would rate this book a 9 out of 10,I would rate it that because it just ended. It didn't really have such a good ending. All the Jacqueline Wilson books I've read did the same thing. It just ended. Otherwise it was a really good book. The book makes you never want to stop reading. It is really exciting and fun to read. I really like The Story Of Tracy Beaker. My favorite (or FAVOURITE) character is Tracy. Tracy is my favorite character because she reminds me of my friend Louisa. She reminds me of my friend Louisa because they both can be really stubborn sometimes and they are both be really fun. I mean I don't know Tracy is fun because I haven't met her but she seems fun. I would recommend it to all the girls in our class. I don't think the boys would like it so much.
5,Great gift,"My sister was delighted that I found a copy of this book for her granddaughter. Came in great shape, her granddaughter loves it."
3,Simply put - great value for the money...,"Bought this to get some basic rythms going - in a matter of minutes the first song was set. The wav file was created and imported into Cakewalk for additional processing.There are some who complain about the product - and I can understand that, but when you want work done fast, and frustration free - it is hard to beat this product.Some minor hangups occurred here and there - nothing that you cannot over come or learn how to avoid.Dont let the advertised age group 6-10 prevent you from buying if you are new to loops and digital music."
5,What a fantastic and original program!,"My 4 yr old daughter and 8 year old son LOVE this program. It is easy to use yet has enough sophistication to interest older kids. I just love that my kids are creating music and can experiment with what makes an interesting song. Super Duper Music Looper makes it easy to create fun catchy music. You can also record your own voice and mix that in as well. In an age where kids want to spend too much time playing mindless computer games, I am always delighted to see them use this software (and sometimes, even their mom even gets to play with it!)."
4,Great for the kids,"My daughter loves it,(she's six).It is a lot of fun to play with, and my daughter makes her own songs without any help from me. Then she dances around her room singing songs she makes up on the spur of the moment. A joyous thing to see.I was going to use the lottery as my retirement fund. Maybe I should just become a show business Dad.Excellent software that will help your kids understand song construction."
2,How can this be the best of the Blessing?,"Delta Rain is by far the best song of the Blessing. Skip this, buy Prince of the Deep Water."
4,Bell Jar,I got this book because I read it in high school and I couldn't remember the story. Reading it didn't exactly bring back any memories but it was intriguing just the same.
3,sylvia is esther greenwood,"prior to reading ""the bell jar"" i read some of sylvia's unabridged journals and there wasn't much of a departure from her real life and the book. now i understand that writers use their own lives to draw from, but this book wasn't much different from reading her own journal entries. it didn't strike me as this literary masterpiece. if i hadn't read the journal entries perhaps i would have felt differently about the book."
1,Big let down!,"I had high expectations of this book because Sylvia Plath came highly recommended by a reliable source, but I was counting the pages until I was done, painfully waiting for the book to get interesting and it never happened. It is easily in the top 3 worse books I've ever read category."
3,A classic without true heart,I thought this book was good but I felt that there was a heartlessness to it. When I read something I want to be really moved by it. This was a good book but for someone with that many feelings it seemed bland. I suggest reading it for the experience.
3,Glimpses of brilliance; gads of selfishness...,"There are brief glimpses of brilliant writing in this book, but as a whole it is not consistently brilliant. What I am struck with the most is the utter selfishness of the author, the main character. For her to keep trying to kill herself simply because she is sated with life, out of sheer ennui from having been given too many opportunities in life, is galling. The author had some talent, but she had a lot more selfishness than talent. And she proved that when she later killed herself in real life. I'm sorry, but you DO NOT kill yourself after you've had children. Sorry, but once you have kids, the suicide option is out. Tell that to Kurt Cobain and Ian Curtis and any other self-centered artist: Try being a responsible human being for a change and quit thinking only about yourself so much."
3,Good enough for school but not for resale,"This was a textbook requirement and though the hardcover was a plus (since I really prefer hardcovers) and the content suited the Women's Studies course I took, owning it now after the fact, gives me no resale value, as is always common as new editions emerge. So unless you are a book collector or avid fan of Sylvia Plath, you may not appreciate having this book after initial use."
3,Left feeling disappointed,"I purchased the 25th anniversary edition after ready an bit of the new introduction, and was really excited to read the book and didn't think that I would be left feeling disappointed. I was wrong - the book seemed to drag, I found it rather fragmented, and just as the story started to get ""good"", I was at the end of the book, and found myself wanting more, when there was nothing more.It is written well, but, I would have to say, I really don't understand what all the hype is about."
4,A cry for help!,"I find this book almost the biography of Sylvia Plath. The protagonist,Esther Greenwood have numerous similarities to Plath. Reading this heart-breaking novel was a totally unforgettable experience.The book began with narration of Esther,19 and trying to write something in the summer in New York,1950. Esther like Plath was going through a difficult phase with life. She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through.Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had care and support plus better treatment,maybe there's hope, or maybe not...."
4,Want to Feel as if You're Trapped Inside a Bell Jar?,"This book will suck you into the mind of Esther Greenwood right away.Sylvia Plath is an author with a confusing writting style yet interesting. This book has many flashbacks into past experiences that Esther has had. This book may appeal to people who can relate to Esther. Esther is a college girl who has a mental break down due to her busy life in New York City, working on a magazine, and deciding what she wants to do after college."
5,A Downward Spiral,"This book was very interesting, and a good insight.I must admit, when I first started to read this book, I Found it difficult to understand somewhat. It seems as if the charactor falls into a point in her life, and you don't even see it coming. The things that you read may seem disturbing, but you can't help but read more. I recomend this book strongly. Pay close attention-the story changes in a blink of the eye."
5,"Don't read if you're already down, but great insight.","Sylvia really writes from a ""someone who gets it"" perspective. I appreciate her raw demeanor and honesty. I found myself relating to her immediately as she drew my mind further and further onto the pages of this novel.***Caution: Unfortunately, I was already at a low point in my emotional cycles (BPD and BD), so when she was contemplating suicide, so was I. By continuing reading I pushed myself all the way over the edge and woke up alive the next day in the ICU at a hospital. So, DO NOT READ if you are at all at a low point!!!"
4,i love it but dont understand it,"first of all,i love sylvia plath,i do.i love her writings and poetry but i just did NOT understand the book! it was all too blury and unclear and i just...can't see who ester was and the time jumps comfused me way too much.i just wish i could understand it better :("
4,Loved The Bell Jar,"I read this book over the summer for school and I really loved it. I usually don't enjoy AP list books but I decided to give it a try because I needed a quick read. It was better than I expected and extremely well written. Some parts were a bit slow, but overall it was very good, and the ending was great."
4,Tragic,"How depression feels to a young woman trying to make it throught the obstacle course of life. Imminently readable but a heroic tragedy just the same. An intelligent woman who left her mark on the world while a disease attacks and confuses her at every turn. Note that she concentrates on the negative and ignores most of the positive--classic symptoms of depression, in additon to frequent crying and sleepiness. For a brief moment she stood at the mountain peak--the toast of the town. Very sad."
3,a good book that's a little hard to read,I thought that the Bell Jar was a good book but was a little difficult to read and confusing at times. I think this is due to the fact that she herself is in a state of confusion. Although I do feel that this book would be helpful to those who are helping someone or themselves in dealing with suicide in their life and will help you to see some of the warning signs of suicide. The Bell Jar is a great book that shows first hand the emotions that a suicidal person goes through and what to do and also what not to do to help them.
5,The Bell Jar Question,"The book I thought was wonderful, but I had a question I had hoped someone could answer. Why after her suicide attempt was her face brusied and swollen and why was her hair all but gone. She never explained what happened- does anyone have any insight? Thanks!"
2,It was An Ok Psychological Thriller,"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~The Bell Jar written by Sylvia Plath is a book that I'm very glad toward mt current Literature teacher for pushing me to read. It examines how too much pressure from society can a young woman. She spirals through a long journey through which realizes she has never done what she has wanted in life but what others wanted. This pushes her to descend into a dark abyss of painful despair. It is a sort of psychological classic type book. Sylvia Plath is remarked to have this book as her crowning achievement. She wrote some other books as welland tons of poetry. I'd say it is an ok book for those into this genre. I liked it but it isn't one of my favorites."
1,Too Bad!,"Too bad, I was excited to read this book after reading a biography of her by Alexander_______. However, the book left me dissappointed. I could not understand anything; while reading, my mind kept wandering. That is a clear sign to me that the book could not grab my attention and it would be a waste of time to try to read the whole book. I just could not follow the writing at all. There was no plot, no flow that lead me from one event to the other.I read some of the other reviews from readers who also did not like the book. Some people felt that the book was too depressing and too self indulgent. That is the whole point of depression. Depression leads the mind inside oneself and finds fault with the world around it or finds fault about him or herself. It makes sense that her book shows the main character as someone who was self-absorbed. That's part of what depression is."
2,Not good untill page 128...,"Ya know how an artist's work isn't worth much until he/she dies? Well this is what happened here. Now I see why it wasn't going to be published when she was alive. Because it is BORING!(The book was published 6 weeks after Sylvia Plath committed suicide. Things always sell better after they are dead.) The entire first half of the book is so monotoned I found myself putting the book down quite often. I kept thinking ""when will she go insane and be interesting?"" I have to say that her description of things was intelligently written it was just so BORING!Let me sum the book up for you and save you the money....girl gets job in NY, girl meets boy, girl dumps boy, girl goes slightly insane, girl goes into a rehab/asylum, girl is up for getting out of the asylum, book ends......just like that! The worst ending ever!I really am torn by giving authors a poor rating because I know how hard they work on their writing but this book was just arrrgghhh boring."
5,belljar1,"Read a library copy of Bell Jar and had to have it. It felt like I was side by side with her, all the way down. It seemed so clear what she was saying, it was spooky. Now I can re-read the book and notate on every page. Books I REALLY like I must write in. Feels like I know her. I always want to understand, or try to, the mental and emotional trials of struggling, highly intelligent individuals. Bell Jar is on the list, and not overwhelming. On the way to Infinite Jest."
4,Plath's Haunting Masterpiece,"Sylvia Plath had a tragically short life on this earth, but she left us The Bell Jar. The Bell Jar is a short, yet jarring story of a young English major descending into mental illness. Plath sets a dark, forlorn, tone from the very first page. Plath had this remarkable gift for language that creates a haunting portrait of a girl losing her mind. Plath's Bell Jar is like a ghostly shadow that seizes the reader around the shoulders and refuses to let go until page 244. The Bell Jar is one of those unique books that stays with the reader psychologically long after the last page is read."
4,A cry for Plath's tears.,"Sylvia Plath simply wrote of her life. The tribulations and upheavels we survive and the depression and anxiety we deal with. This book was one of the best books i personally have ever read. I too am bipolar, and enjoy reading a historical look at one of the worlds most talented writers of all time, and how she coped w/ her depressions. How life seemed to her, how she wrote, how she lived. In vivid and bold motion she wrote imagery like never i have seen before. Almost making things so unbelievable and intriguing that they were too realistic. Her philosophys are trying and dark, but the opposite of sides brings light to the opposition. I personally loved this book."
4,Exploring the hazy barrier between sane and insane,"Reading The Bell Jar, I have uncomfortable moments where I see whispers of Esther's insanity in myself. Plath has created a character (or maybe recorded herself in a way) that is eminently believable, and begins the book with a personality that doesn't hint at what is to come later. Her apathy and distraction grow so gradually, normality and madness blend into each other so finely, that it is disconcertingly jarring to realize how hazy and meaningless the word ""normal"" really is. For some reason we seem to expect that we would know insanity instantly were we to see it, or experience it, ourselves. But of course the difference between a ""normal"" person and a person suffering from a mental disorder is a construct of our society, not an immutable distinction. This book is beautifully written, with many scenes that linger in my memory. It ends ambiguously, but the sad story of its author gives the entire work a somber feel."
4,"Subtle, rational, insane.","Plath's story may leave you with the sense that a sane and healthy mind is much more of a fragile thing than you expected. By turns entertaining, funny, dark, and poetic; Plath's writing infuses her character with genuine humanity. She allows us a unique insight into an unwell mind. Strangely enough, I often found myself cracking a slow smile as I read the thoughts of a completely rational character whose descent into insanity seemed so natural and reasonable."
5,Madness and Brilliance,"The Bell Jar is a stark narrative about depression, and the power it has to completely immobilize protagonist Esther Greenwood and throw her into insanity. The Bell Jar's prose is easy to read, and yet Sylvia Plath's writing style is highly sophisticated and exact, which is startling considering the nearness of her own suicide. Esther Greenwood begins an ambitious and talented young writer, working for a beauty magazine in New York, and attending college on a full scholarship. Her sorrow and madness begin to surface, and she soon finds herself trapped in a revolving door of mental asylums. The interesting thing here is way the story is told; unflinchingly and without remorse. I could hear Plath's cold, spare, incisive voice behind that of Miss Greenwood - hurting and ready to die. The Bell Jar can be read as a fierce indictment on depression. It is a brilliant, haunting, frightening work, and it held my interest intensely the whole way through."
5,Exquisite,"This novel is fascinating because it is not driven by the usual plot devices writers use to move a story along. The reader is sucked into this book by Sylvia Plath's exquisite narrative voice: her similies are still startling even after so many years, her word choices are flawless, and she is a master at choosing just the right details-- and nothing more to bog down the narrative flow-- that illuminate a scene.The plot has a true ring to me. I suspect that most people who have made it through most of a college program, and must confront the courses and people which they have managed to avoid for many semesters; that, or not finish their program, would feel the same way. I don't think a person must be depressive in order to relate to the malaise of the beginning of the book. By the time things become, well...strange, the reader has already been pulled into Esther's head, and sees events from her perspective. Her depression seems almost inevitable.Beautiful and perfect."
3,The Bell Jar was interesting,"I had to read the Bell Jar for my English class and write a research paper on it. To be honest, reading it was not one of the most joyous times of my life. The book maily focuses on the depressing parts of Esther and her monotonous life. All throughout the book she is falling down on her knees and has not stregnth not get back up and face the world. She continually hides from people and does not show the true person she is. Esther has no self confidence and wishes to seduce the first man who comes across her path. She is a desperate person with little self moral. But, on a good note, Plath writes about her depression so descriptively, you actually feel like you are going down with Esther. I would not recommend this book to the person wishing to read something for fun, but for the more serious and mature reader. Reading a book for fun is what Harry Potter is for. Hope this helps alot!"
4,Relatively Sane,"Plath was an incredible and intense mind. Through her writing, she sent emotions and feeling to an incredible amount of people. The story of The Bell Jar is really Plath letting her being seep out onto paper. The writing is classic and leads me to believe that the whole idea of ""sanity"" has become almost non existent, as well as overrated."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"This book is really incredible. It is a really short read and it has this great way of sucking you in. The whole time I was reading it I felt as if I was going crazy right along with the main character! It's really a shame that Plath wasn't able to write more, she's one of the most talented authors I've read."
5,love Sylvia Plath's work,I love Sylvia Plath's work. She is a great writer that did not live to see her well received style of writing. RIP Sylvia
2,Not exactly what I expected,No idea what all the fuss is about. Kinda uneven in places and just the brilliant piece of writing I expected.
3,"Dramatic life, under-delivered book","I read this book after I finished Ronald Hayman ""Death and Life of Sylvia Plath"". Considering just how dramatic her life was (that ended in suicide), and how much she was such a melodramatic person (a scene between her husband and his mistress), I was a bit disappointed to find that this semi-autobiographical book isn't dramatic enough. She told the story in almost monotone, teenage, and detach way, even though at rare points she does become ""involved"". I guess I was expecting to read a much more ""gut wrenching dramatic"" story telling considering that her actual life WAS like that."
4,Interesting but sad due to the knowledge that it was real.,"I found The Bell Jar to be an interesting overview of Plath's breakdown but the way her sorrow pulled you in was tremendously sad.The knowledge that her pain was real made it a true life horror story.A wonderful book, just not for rainy days."
5,Mirrors Sylvia Plath's own nervous breakdown at age 20.,"I read this novel for the first time when I was a freashman in high school, and instantly loved it. It is heartbreaking, at times humorous, and young adult females will surely see a little bit of themselves in the character Esther Greenwood. Overall, it is humane and sobering. It would be a mistake not to read it."
5,The book I've re-read constantly...,"This is one of the best books I have ever read.I do not know how many times I have read this book, but I suspect it is over 20. I would recommend The Bell Jar to anyone who has ever questioned their inner feelings, or who has ever felt as though they were different from others.This book continues to strike a chord with me."
2,Lost in the Bell Jar,"While many people rave about this story I fail to see where it's brilliance is. I read it upon recommendation by a friend. And while I did enjoy the style in which it was written, overall this book left me feeling empty. I felt I had wasted my time. Mostly because I could not at all sympathize with the main character except in the most extreme of cicumstances, such as the shock therapy. Other than those few moments, I did not feel like she was subject to any unusually cruel acts or treatment. The majority of my disappointment came in the end. I felt there wasn't any kind of payoff, no real conclusion.Maybe I was distracted by all the little notes my friend had written in the book. Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy (which I sincerely doubt.) Personally, I would much rather read Ms. Plath's poetry than trudge this this little volume again.I give it two stars, for while I didn't necessarily enjoy the plot, the prose were downright hilarious at times!..."
3,A Reflection of Sylvia Plath,"Reading Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar, is like entering the life of a young woman that is trying to grow up in a male-dominated society. The main chareacter, Esther Greenwood, is approached by many mental and physacle obsticles. Her mind is overcomed by many emotions and menatlly challenged problems. She struggles with many issues from suicide to relationships. The Bell Jar is a great book for woman and especially teens. It deals with some issues that young ladies deal with everyday. Esther Greenwood portrayed a self-reliant woman, but was in need of help from the world that she avoided. Sylvia's style of writing is very simplistic and easy to understand, but is also full of radiant detail. It's not a story that causes bordem, but instead curiosity and interest. This book is said to be a reflection of the Plath's life,but is also a reflecton to lives of many young woman all over the world. This novel is some what disturbing but is a true American classic."
2,Maybe I don't get it.,"The other night A&E Classroom ran an excellent biography of Sylvia Plath. I was very moved by the story of this brilliant woman who died so young and so tragically. I knew of her name from long ago having grown up just down the road from Smith; however, I never read any of her work. I just read The Bell Jar. While I will never forget the tormented story of Esther Greenwood, I would not rate this as a masterpiece of fiction. Perhaps the real talent is in her poetry."
1,I made a serious mistake.,I thought this was one of the American classics I should read... I couldn't get halfway through it. I was totally interested and wanted to read this... But it's just so whiny and pititful. Pass on this one.
