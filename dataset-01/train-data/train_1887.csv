3,Good Introduction,"As always, this example of the Starting Out series provides a good first introduction to an important alternative to the ubiquitous sicilian. A reasonably good survey of the main lines and an interesting and well-annotated selection of illustrative games."
1,Good if you want to prepare against caro-kann ..,I bought this book to with hopes of seeing black winning with this deference but it was a disappointment as book shows mostly white wins in main lines of caro kann.
3,Gereric Surfboards,"In the retail surf shop business it must be remembered that a surfboard is considered a fashion accessory. The average customer is between 14 and 22 years old and has $200.00 of their parents money to spend. They don't spend their money on surfboards, but on clothes, sunglasses, and other surfing related items. Retailers rely on surfers buying the $100.00 pair of sunglasses with brand name recognition, rather than the $10.00 pair, to be cool and avoid being labled a kook. They rely on surfers buying into this idea. 99% of the adds in surf magazines are for name recognition for fashion.Every surfer was a kook at one time. When do you stop being a kook? Is it when you learn to surf well, or when you get your $100.00 sunglasses and your custom shaped board?If someone can buy a brand new molded surfboard for 1/2 the price of a hand made board, why not? There will always be shapers to make boards for the non-kooks. Go surfing on your Bic board, but watch out for snobs."
3,Too Much Flex - BUY ELSEWHERE!,"These moulded boards and the soft-tops all have way too much flex and you can't get any real speed when you need it. Speed is essential and it comes from a flat planed bottom with a slight V or channels. These ain't got those things. Don't park with the board in the sun for a long time or it'll melt to your car roof and then you won't have a good car or a board anymore. Skip buying a surfboard online, and remember ""you get what you pay for"" but for another $100 or $200 you can buy the real deal at your local beach shop."
3,Swedish smoresgard,"It is a comedy that is quite funny at times. Unfortunately, at times there is more yelling than comedy. It is fair."
2,Call the paramedics.,"Is it possible that anyone could present this work as more lifeless than did Norrington and the London Classical Players? I sincerely doubt it. The key, I think, to this disaster can be found in Norrington's notes: ""We try to play the SCORE [italicized in the original]..."". They're so busy trying to be reproducers of marks on paper, and concentrating on keeping in time with the metronome, that they forgot to make MUSIC. The only reason I don't give this 1 star is that some of the sonorities produced by the instruments they use are interesting... IF you can stay awake long enough to hear them."
2,no coverage of implemented restructuring plans or evalutions,"Disappointing. I was expecting to be able to see the author's evaluation and analysis of the restructuring plans which were implemented in each instance. If I had known that this book only attempts to ""set the scene"", then I wouldn't have bothered to buy it. I guess that if you have the time to reflect on the scenarios and come up with a group moderated hypothetical solution then the book might satisfy some people but if you are in the field and looking for possible guidance or at least the benefit of someone's hindsight, then give the book a miss.Disappointing"
2,Rather Bland,"Scenes of the animals lacked action. Some animal kills or chases, predators stalking, or life or death situations would have made the disk more interesting."
1,More about His own inner fantasies than reality.,"Basically footages of Japan off the usual tourist track and nothing more. There are still many beatiful towns in Japan today so I don't see how this film captured anything lost or vanishing in Japan. Besides, its so boring!His narration is self centered talking about Japanese culture as if he knows something about it(he doesn't). He also focuses on women, young japanese women too much making me think that this love affair with Japan is more of a love affair with its women - he stereo types them as docile, submissive and ""made to please man"" types."
3,worth the price,"it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
1,"I'm a Big Crumb Fan, but wound up returning this","Even though this book is loaded with Crumb art, it is very obvious that R. Crumb was arm-twisted into doing this book, and he even admits this several times throughout it. Forgive me but, this book was flat-out awful. It's all about Harvey Pekar - who is every bit as self-obsessed as Crumb but with none of his friend's redeeming neurotic quirky charm. His writing is depressing and oppressive without substantive relief of any kind. Even Crumb's drawings can't save it. For the obsessive collector only, I would not recommend it to the average R. Crumb fan."
3,SubPar At Best,This Cd Was Ok It Was A Dirty South Meets The Midwest And There Were A Few Decent Tracks Like Lemonade And I Shine But All In All It Wasnt The Best Cd I Have Ever Purchased But For Like 3 Bucks It Was Worth It
3,Funny stuff!,"The DVD starts out with Kelly and Danny, naked from the waist up for you to drool over. Hit ""pause"" on your player and drool all you want!After that, there's lots of funny stuff on this disc. Outakes, extended scenes, questions answered. It's a ""fun"" disc and everyone has a good time. The ""serious/racial"" stuff from the show, and the ""nasty/tell-all"" stuff from the book are nowhere to be seen.The best parts for me were the analysis of each cast member's dancing style, and Melissa's hilarious abuse of OnStar. Put the disc in, fast forward to ""Which way do we go?"" and prepare to laugh yourself silly!A definite must-have if you enjoyed the New Orleans series!"
4,An Entertaining Video,"I recently got this video and it's great. It's very funny, and you get to see the opinions of all 7 people. I wasn't sure if I sure get this video but I'm glad I did!"
4,Surprisingly Funny!,"This video of extra scenes from the New Orleans cast is really pretty funny! Although the cast hasn't been the best cast ever this year, they seem most real when they're setting up the funniest moments in this video. Julie surprised me in this video. You get to see an even wilder side of her that you don't see much in the episodes on tv. There are actually some surprises in this video with flirty segments on Danny & Kelley and Julie & Matt. Fans of Danny will be happy too because he gets a lot of attention on this video. I don't have the DVD but I think that it has a lot of extra stuff on it like clips from their casting tapes which would be cool. I highly recommend it!"
2,Disappointing; this could have been shown on TV.,I was expecting an uncensored video; instead I saw blurred out body parts and bleeped out language just like on TV. I feel the description of this video is misleading.
5,Inspirational to your dreams of building your own home.,"Lindal Cedar Homes ORINGINALS not only has drop dead gorgeous homes in full color pictures, this ""coffee table"" book shares valueable information about the necessary steps required to have your dream home built. Information from the very beginning, the design process, to the end, along with beginning budgets and having your home grow with you.Everyone that has picked this book up from my coffee table ""ooo's and ah's"" at the beauty of incorporating a breath taking veiw of mountains and landscape in to the living space of these homes.In fact, I was to mail my sister my copy of this book, but just couldn't part with it. Therefore, I decided to see if my favorite book store (Amazon.com) had it. Of course, they did, therefore, I'm having them send her a book of her own as a gift.Elizabeth Hoyt"
4,Beautiful pictures but its really an ad.,"I saw this book and got it for the pictures and the blueprints. I love looking at house plans because my goal is to design and build a home in the future so the more ideas I get, the more likely I am to create my ""dream"". Or I'll get confused. Either way, I love home design books. However this is also an advertisement for Lindal Cedar Homes so I'm sure they are highlighting their best work and not putting in their prices for a reason: I bet the homes are fairly expensive. Regardless I loved the multitude of color photographs and drawings. Perhaps I'll consider the company once I'm settled down to build a house."
2,Algunas cosas Buenas.. pero,"Tiene gran contenido, pero la mayor√≠a es demasido muy obvio, parece que libro infantil y explica las cosas como para kidergarden.El papel es de muy mala calidad."
4,A Great Guide,"My family and I just returned from Tuscany and found this guide to be invaluable. The maps, diagrams and pictures are top notch. Although some of the historical and artistic themes are only covered briefly (e.g. the Medici family, Dante, Mannerist painting, etc) it is sufficient to give you a general sense of the key themes and players. The rest is up to you.What was also particularly useful was the restuarant guide and off the beaten track locations such as Saturnia. Even though I'm moderately fluent in Italian the mini phrase book at the back came in handy. I couldn't remember how to say duck in Italian (l'anatra), and was surprised to find it in the guide.If you're even remotely considering buying a Florence and/or Tuscany guide, look no further, this is the guide for you."
4,Enough to schedule the next trip ...,"Eyewitness Travel Guide has been recommended by seasoned traveler friends and I can't disagree, just wished for more time to follow all leads!"
4,Florence and Tuscany,We used this guide and found it to be excellent. We had several guides but this was the most complete and easy to use.
4,Great book for self-guided travelers,"My husband and I are free spirit travelers that like to keep the planning somewhat spontaneous, yet still have enough planning to get the most from the experience. We enjoyed this book for providing enough history and background to provide context for the experiene. Plus this book (along with the help of a great GPS system) was great for mapping and planning the day. I actually used a friend's books for our trip and thought they were so great that I bought a copy for myself as a keepsake for when we returned."
2,Hard Read,"This book is packed with information but it's hard to follow. Too much information is not necessarily helpful. Expected a suggested travel plan instead of the way it is organized. By the time I was through scanning the guide, the trip seemed like it was in the 'too hard to do' box."
3,Extremely loud fans...,"This was recommended to me by a certified electrician who has used them, unfortunately the volume level of the fan is so high that this needs to be in a separate room or machine room. There is no way of changing it."
5,big government men,"Imagine a Republican who believes in a big government? This wonderful biography of Benjamin Harrison is useful for us today to sort out a different era. While this is short, it certainly covers an era in which few of us are very familiar. However, the era is the foundation of today, and this book opens a window for us."
4,A little known activist President,"I learned something from this book. I did not actually know too much about Ben Harrison but this short biography sure did teach me something about him. Harrison was a one term President who actually accomplished something in his four years. He fought the free silver coinage act, passed the Sherman antitrust act, lowered tariffs, but did not extinguish them, and worked for voting rights for black Americans. He also did alot of his own foreign relations, since his Secretary of State Blaine was constantly ill. He was a diligent hard worker who would shame some of our lazier presidents.Due to all this activism, Harrison lost the mid term Congressional elections, and ultimately his office. He didn't seem to mind, because he thought he would be happier back home in Indianapolis. I enjoyed the author talking about Harrison's personal life. He married again after he left the White House. A nice biography of a little known President."
5,A good read,"A well written and understandable account of a little-known and, possibly, the ""first modern"" president, foreshadowing McKinley. Benjamin Harrison seems to have been an honest man who kept his eye on the ball. His presonal life is intersting and given in just the right amount of detail. His relationship with Blaine, his secretary of state if most interesting and certianly not sympathetic to Blaine."
1,No substance,"Amy Wallace's 400+ page book is quite a disappointment to wade through. Her writing becomes increasingly self indulgent and tedious as she drones on about her theories of hormone imbalance, depression, romance and cults. All of this would be quite forgivable, if she gave some insight into Carlos Castaneda. But because of her mental instability and ""political incorrectness"" she was unable to penetrate the inner circle of Castaneda and his followers and was reduced to the role of mistress (one of many, apparently). Did Don Juan exist? Did Castaneda and the witches perform magic? Really, I have no clue after reading this. She wasn't there behind closed doors (other than when Castaneda took her to a hotel room!). There is no insight here, but plenty of self pity and misguided soul searching. Don't waste your time reading this."
5,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"This book answered all my questions about Castaneda, after years of searching. I read it in a single sitting, staying up till 5:00 a.m. Don't miss a chance to read one of the bravest memoirs imaginable."
5,Not the first time this has been said,"Amy Wallace was not the first person to write about this side of Castaneda. The bad anthropology behind Castaneda's writings was the basis of a 1993 book by Dr. Jay Courtney Fikes titled ""Carlos Castaneda: Academic Opportunism and the Psychedelic Sixties"". He claims that Dr. Peter Furst and another anthropologist named Meyerhoff knowingly fabricated and misrepresented rituals in collaboration with Castaneda."
1,Carlos Castaneda's Love Slave,"What an incredible mess of a book! The only thing I liked about this book was the dust-jacket cover. The book is so full of bizarre gossip and contradictions it is laughable. For instance, she writes that ""she wasn't much of a drinker"" a couple pages after graphically describing how she regularly got drunk on champagne with one of ""the witches"". After claiming to have been a close disciple of Carlos Castaneda for many years she provides no insight into what this ""spiritual path"" entailed. All she seems to have done was attend a bunch of seminars in Los Angeles and around the country and hop in the sack with ""the nagual"". A far cry from Carlos' sorcery training with Don Juan I'd say. She paints such a depressing picture of an incredibly disfunctional group of people including herself that's it's pathetic."
5,Rumpelstiltskin,"Other reviewers charge Castaneda and his followers with being a cult, which means nothing--early Christianity was a cult. But, like so many other people, I thought Castaneda had the teaching I was looking for. For a long time I tried to use his views and practices, had some mystical experiences, but they didn't make my life any better or lead to any lasting spiritual change. Still I felt pulled by the lingering charisma, until I read this book. Many thanks to Amy Wallace for opening my eyes, as did another revealing book, ""The Life & Teachings of Carlos Castaneda,"" by William Patrick Patterson. The hypnotic spell is broken."
2,What a waste of time and money-Rubbish,"What a waste of time and money,,, its obvious the author is seriously delusional and suffers from serious states of denial, if u are a fan of castenada you would better of not reading this rubbish, this is a pitifull attempt to make a few dollars by the author off of carlos castenada's image , in no way will this book help u on the shaminic path or help u to learn anything significant about carlos the nawal, only petty arguments , jealous cat like behaviour and stupid disagreements between women line these pages . They never got any idea what it takes to become a master of the arts and were only looking to live in their own litle fantasy world of lust, lies and sex which led them to totally misss the lesson he was trying to impart to them, Yes carlos was not perfect but he knew the shaminic arts but sadly no amount of tough love would help these pitifull women. . what rubbish this book is."
1,Anything can be published,This book is so poorly written I am amazed that it found a publisher. Self indulgent and narcisistic in tone and totally dilusional in content.
1,Amazingly bad,"I've read a slew of books in my day, nothing comes close, in sheer badness, to this one. Its hard to imagine how anyone could appear to be more reprehensible that Castaneda and his cohorts, as Ms. Wallace describes them...but then there's the mindboggling proof on nearly every page, that however vile the subjects of her writing may be, she tops them with a gorgons knot of deception, delusion (ongoing) and whining. Super yuck. Still, this may be the penultimate memoir of just how low someone with too much time and money on their hands can go. That its so badly written just adds to the ""gestalt"" of it all. Don't miss this if you want to read a bad book."
5,The Truth Revealed...,"FABULOUS book! Amy has tremendous courage to write about her life with Carlos and reveal the truth about the so-called Nagual. I suspected after reading Carlos' series of books that he may have made up the whole thing and Amy confirmed it. This is another eye-opening account of what a misguided guru can do to his disciples. For those who are easily addicted to the spiritual explorations of our time, this is an excellent warning to stay as far away from those who would disempower you as possible. Carlos was a man, not a God and as a man...he had feet of clay like anyone else. Shows you how stupid people are to always look for a spiritual leader when really they should be looking within for their own guidance."
5,Lover of Magic,"Amy Wallace...dear sorcerers,... met Carlos Castaneda when she was a teenager and was quickly fascinated by him, and in time in love. Later in life, she became a part of his sorcerer's group, the inner circle of devotees, mainly women, who hung around with him and vied for his attention. If you wish to know the truth of Castaneda as a sorcerer, this is one of the best and most insightful books on the subject from one who really was there. For a less personal view read Richard DeMille'sCastaneda's Journey: The Power and the Allegorybut for the inner story, this is the place. Perhaps because these elves knew and know someone who has the type of charisma Amy describes Carlos as having, and were trained by sorcerers ours'elves, this book has additional meaning for us, but we feel that anyone who seeks the truth about Castaneda will find a great deal of it here.kyela,the silver elves"
3,I'm disappointed,"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book and was disappointed when I finally had the opportunity. I quickly grew tired of the gossipy stories about the cult around Castaneda. I wanted to know more about the man but I finished the book with little more understanding then when I started. I was also disappointed by the author's ""my parents did it to me"" explanation for here relationship with the ""Nagual.""I found the flow of the book choppy and if I wasn't looking for interesting nuggest about Carlos, I wouldn't have bothered to finish reading it."
2,Intention,"I just finished Amy's book and, among the many question marks that have been asked by other reviewers, I wonder the most about what Amy was actually looking for?Yes, joining a path like this contains heavy deconstruction - never nice! The little ego having a hard time to die. But then this is why people follow this path, no? So why clinging onto that little ego so badly instead of using the chance and deconstruct?Along the same lines I'm also wondering if there has been any sort of structure-building, besides Tensegrity, i.t.o. subtle body . energy development. Or, not having practised Tensegrity myself, what is the purpose of all these hours of training? What was their world about in the end? What was the intention, the purpose of all that suffering? Its very hard to believe that it all just happened on the horizontal layer of the perceptions and interpretations of the ordinary mind?"
4,good shoe,This is a pretty decent shoe. It is comfortable and I can wear it to work. The insole comes out easily to slip in an orthotic also.
3,Just OK but not Great,"The good things about this watch are that it is a Timex, sells at a good price, has a nice brown finish, keeps good time, and I like the Indigo backlight. The downside for me is, even though it is a 40mm face a lot of this is outside the actual glass itself so the numerals aren't as big as I would like, the band and metal catch are horrible. I would prefer a one inch band instead of a .75 inch. Much too thin of a band for me. Watches are kind of a personal thing so your mileage may vary... Just my thoughts."
4,A romantic tragedy in a war between two nations,"This video, told from the view of a neutral farmer (Alan), is about how two nations begin a war which ends up destroying hundreds of lives, including Alans. Two couples get torn apart by the war, Alan's because he becomes involved in the war and (in a Romeo and Juillet type storyline) the royal couple (Roland and Veronica). This story will make you cry, and is great is you like tragic romances."
3,Mecak Strikes Again!,"I saw this first in a dubbed format, and then again on a subtitled version, and wow, what a difference! The story was good in both versions, but the dub has scenes cut out and shortened, and the dialogue really sucks. I would say buy this if you want to see a really beautiful and very emotionally heavy film, but remember that the film has been butchered and is much better in the subtitled format."
5,Gorgeous!,"My husband loves this watch! I purchased it for a Valentine's gift but went ahead and gave it to him, he loves it! Dressy and casual too, a really nice time piece."
5,Phonics Vol 1,I have a hearing impaired child and SHE looks at the mouth movement. She has started to repeat what they are saying. GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Learning Tool,This video is a great learning tool! My son actually enjoys watching it and trying to read the words! I plan to buy this for gifts as well! Fun yet educational!
3,Product may not work in auto DVD player,"I recently bought several educational DVDs for my children to listen while riding in our vehicle, and I was quite disappointed when the Rock n Learn DVD was in a format that could NOT be played in our (2010) van. We have many DVDs and have never experience any problems playing any of them, including the other educational DVDs that I just purchased. As a result, I was quite surprised to receive an UNSUPPORTED FORMAT error in the van when trying to play the Rock n Learn DVD. How disappointing!! as Rock n Learn has such a good selection of educational DVDs, including ones for older children, that I would have loved to purchase. However, being in a format that can NOT be played in a vehicle DVD defeats the educational reinforcement that was to be given to a child that will not sit through watching DVDs at home but loves to watch them in the van."
5,Super CD!!!,"I previously owned this cd and have played it in my U.S. History classroom. Class really enjoyed several tunes, esp. Christmas in the Trenches. Liked it so well somebody ""borrowed"" it from me so I needed a new copy!"
5,Good selection of easy to tie flys!,I'm not as cordinated as I was when I was younger and this book has many quick and easy to tie flys. It focuses on simplicity and flys that work.
2,this starightner does not work for very frizzy hair!,This straightner only works if you have thin hair or already straight hair! I tried it and it took my 2 hours with a blow dryer and brush! Don't use it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Aardvark facade hide intelligent, mature storyline","I could have bought this book for the cover alone. The shot of the Regency hotel, rendered with about a zillion lines by background artist Gerhard, still gives me this sense of awe when I stare at it. Fortunately this story offers so much more than pretty pictures. Hidden within the framework of a fantasy setting is a scathing portrayal of government, all acted out by a cast only Dave Sim could create, from the unique Cerebus to the impossible Lord Julius. This is Dave Sim in high form and though the art is not his best (it appears that most of the story takes place in the dark, since there are few backgrounds), his writing is a deft as always. The serious parts are serious and the amusing parts are absolutely hilarious and the ending wraps it all up neatly while still paving the way for ""Church and State"". This book set the tone for the series and pointed the way for the ambitious tales that were to come later"
4,Dave Sim's Aardvark anthology is worth the 25 bucks.,"I have just discovered Cerebus. Well, I knew about it, I had heard of it, but I never really thought to look into it. I saw the graphic novel collections at my local comic book store, and felt compelled to pick up High Society, mainly because of Dave Sim's breathtaking drawings. Now that I have read this one, I know for a fact that comics don't need gut-spattering violence and garishly-clad muscle-men to be entertaining. I'm buying Church and State volumes 1 and 2 tomorrow."
3,"Surprisingly anti-climactic, irritating and superflous storyline, I am sad","I was so excited to find volumes one and two, (used) being a graphic novel, cartoon freak, I felt like I was touching the Holy Grail of cartoon-doom. Not what I expected, and basically, just not that good. Felt more like I was getting in touch with Sims' insanity, not a place I want to be."
2,"High Society, Low Entertainment....","High Society is made out to be Pompous. It is a tired lame story that runs on and on and never seems to go anywhere. If you like pointless mythical political stories that are dry at best, this is the book for you. All the supporting characters are lame attempts at farce. If you want to see something with Groucho Marx in it please get yourself a Marx Bros. Movie. If you want to read some lame Moon Knight Stories go read Moon Knight. The art is basic Mad Magazine fare, and the only interesting Character----Cerebus becomes less and less interesting as the story goes on. It's a boring 500 page political satire. You can tell Sim got bored with it as well as the last quarter of the book is drawn sideways. Wish I could tell you something good about it, but it's just not there to tell."
3,Disappointing.,"A great parade spoiled by a very shaky cameraman,most of disk one was so wobbly that you felt like throwing something at the tv set.Were all those half naked dancers too much for the person behind the camera?,a pity really,apart from that glaring fault the rest of the two dvds were excellent and I would have given it high marks,as it is,I am reluctant to recommend it to any buyer."
4,Good Basic Information,So far I like this book. I have not finished the book yet but what I have read is very informative. Its worth the read.
2,What does the holy bible have to do with hormones?,"This was an excellent book except for one glaring exception and that is the author sprinkled verses of scripture throughout the book. I found her bible thumbing quite jarring and inappropriate and I plan to return the book despite its rich content. Perhaps Mrs. Smith should have warned her readers by properly titling the book something like ""When Your Christian Hormones Go Haywire"" or ""Solutions for Christian Women over 40""."
2,"It works, but lacks seller description....","I bought this to switch between my 17"" Dell Display (1440 x 900 px) to do my work and my 32"" Sony LCD to watch movies.(1360 x 768 px).It does not work with either resolutions. The product is of good quality but it is not working for me.If you want to use it for HD/widescreens displays, try another product instead."
3,Better for older boxes,"Works fine with my older PC, but can't handle the resolution from the new one. Resolution from the new one is slightly blurry, and apparently the only way to correct it is to make it ridiculously large. Was looking for a cheap solution..."
5,No pinched fingers!,"My husband had no problem installing these quickly in our cabinets and drawers. We love the feature of them locking once opened so fingers don't get pinched. So far, our little one has not been able to pull anything out of the drawer even once it is opened (about 1 inch). They are easy to use with one hand for adults to access the drawers. We bought more for other parts of the house after installing this set!"
5,Easy to install and does the job,"I installed these onto our cabinets myself. You just have to get it precise. A millimeter or two off and it won't work smoothly. And you know how annoying it is when you're busy in the kitchen and one darn cabinet doesn't open or close smoothly. Frustrating.My kid yanks on the cabinets quite forcefully but so far, these latches haven't come loose.Will buy more to install on our drawers as he's taken an interest to drawers now."
4,Great for cabinet doors but not so much for drawers.,Simple to install and exactly what I expected. They stop my children from opening cabinets completely and prevent them from closing it on their fingers. but the drawer install I not very effective.
1,The anti-finger pincher is a big FLOP.,"As with most locks, it is hard to get the pieces lined up just right when installing them. The worst thing about this product is that the catch that is supposed to prevent your child from opening the cabinet a crack and then reslamming his/her fingers in there doesn't work. The catch almost never catches. In fact the only time it catches is when an adult forgets about the cabinet lock and tries to open the cabinet with an adult's normal force. Then it catches. And it is difficult to unhitch. I could go on about the other design defects about this product, but I don't want to waste my time. I recommend buying one of the cabinet locks with a little joint and spring in there."
4,All Max was looking for was a little action,"Quiet Thunder rolls strong and steady across the African plains. A hard drinking, womenizing bush pilot and a voluptuous senator's wife becomes the dark continent's most hunted big game. Witnessess to political assassination, they must be tracked down and eliminated. Their desperate escape leads them across the rugged African terrain, into the world of ancient magical tribal spirits and across that invisible line between miracles and murder."
2,Diz & guests in rare old 40's era public domain film footage,"This scratchy old B&W; film collection captures Dizzy and crew including vocalist Helen Humes live in New York City between 1946-1947, performing 18 classic compositions such as ""Salt Peanuts,"" ""Oop Bop Sh'bam"", ""Grosvenor's Square,"" ""Night in Tunisia,"" and more.Better sit back and get your muggles on though, because the cornball presentation features somewhat dated if not convoluted dancing numbers that strain one's attention at times. Some of the serious ballet seems like unintentional comedy, but all in all a good historical look for jazz buffs at Gillespie in his early years."
5,Not Just Outstanding,"This album is my favorite and I have an extensive Christmas music collection. The guitar is bell like in clarity, particularly the Gretsch which Atkins plays elegantly, and, the recording is meticulously engineered. The CD may sound as beautiful as the vinyl. I don't know. I've never heard the CD, but the photography on the LP cover is worth the purchase. I guess it was photographed in Tennessee, but it sure looks like my favorite cross country trial on the south face of Camel's Hump in Vermont. In any case, each musical piece is exquisite in every way. This year, a very discerning New Year's Eve guest who did not recognize the guitarist called this album ""extremely tasteful"" and I strongly agree. It is not merely outstanding, it may be a perfect Christmas guitar recording!"
4,An essential tool for all humanitarian law students,"Roberts and Guelff's ""Documents on the laws of war"" is a comprehensive collection of the treaties that created the body of armed conflict law and an essential tool for all students approaching this subject. The various documents are preceded by brief introductions which help even the most unacquainted user to orientate himself and to understand the origins, the context and the importance of the various sources. Even the practitioner will find it very useful, thanks to a detailed index at the end of book which allows to find the relevant legal material in few minutes. Last but not least, it contains the most recent treaties of this legal field, such as the 1999 2nd Hague Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property in the event of armed conflict, or the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. I have recently used this book for my exam in international humanitarian law and it has certainly helped me to obtain a first class mark!"
5,An indispensable text,"Adam Roberts and Richard Guelff have further refined their excellent text on humanitarian law. This book is an absolute must for students, academics, operations lawyers and politicians alike. Written in clear, concise and exact English 'Documents on the Laws of War' is a comprehensive collection of treaty and customary law. An operations lawyer could be be considered as 'negligent' if s/he failed to have this guide to the 'law of armed conflict' by his/her side at all times. Essential reading and reference."
3,"Ian Tyson, Cowboy of the CENTURY Rides in the studio","Ian sounds like he is in the studio with this CD...not as good as an open mike in front of folks, but he still has the ability tosell a song...and he is the #1 Western Singer this Century...so it is a keeper.He is half of Ian & Sylvia Team that broke up in 77...but the music still moves along well and is excellent."
2,Much Overrated,"This is not a history of Ancient Persia but rather a set of essays on just a few topics: ""The Testimonies"" (i.e. the historical sources); ""The King and his Subjects""; and ""Everyday Life"".Basically, apart from the Bisutun relief (text available at http://www.avesta.org/op.htm) and the Persepolis Texts (R. T. Hallock, Chicago 1969), nearly all the sources are Greek or Latin upon which the author relies despite the contrary assertion given by the publisher on the flyleaf. It's not the ancient Greek and Roman writers that the author attempts to discredit but rather the modern writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Better to read ""The Persian Empire"" by J. M. Cook or ""A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire"" by Muhammad A. Dandamaev."
3,An intersting book,A well researched book however the author seems to be confused with Zoraoastrainism and suffice to say that he refers in many places to Zoroastrian 'gods' while the religion is montheistic believing in Ahuramazda or the Wise Lord.
1,A Plot to Discourage any Future VB5 Programmers,"The concept is great but the execution is so poor that I almost gave up on programming. There are so many typos, particularly in their code examples, and misleading statements (some that were *directly* contradicted a page or two later) in the first 3 chapters that I almost gave up completely on learning VB. I have no other programming experience and thought their approach was ""The Way to Learn."" I was sadly mistaken.Even their on-line site has typos and their errata sheet contains errata!!!I am extremely disappointed in their shoddy work (and the waste of $50) and eternally grateful that there are other publishers who provide quality material."
2,TOO MANY ERRORS + LEAPS IN LOGIC + SPAGHETTI CODE (argh! ),"This book contains way too many errors! Examples contain variable names that differ from the explanatory text! VERY FRUSTRATING! Some of the example programs build upon each other from lesson to lesson. This would normally be great except for the fact that a lot of the code becomes redundant and SPAGHETTI-ISH (which causes many runtime errors). Although you could learn a lot from this book, it is generally too frustrating to use it. Even the Waite Group's web site is extremely poor. Honestly, buy a book from a different publisher...you'll just be sorry if you buy VISUAL BASIC 5 INTERACTIVE COURSE!"
3,"Great concept, but too many errors.","The on-line ""mentors"", discussion group archives, and having the book and tests on-line are great. The almost continuous stream of errors are not. I found the book educational and enjoyable, except for the many errors."
1,Don't buy this product,This thing doesn't even work. What a waste of time and money! Now I have to go return it. I'll never buy another Memorex product again! I've had much better experiences with SanDisk brand card readers. I'm very disappointed with Memorex's low quality. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy Memorex products!
3,...hmm...well it's certainly noodling...,...I was very intrigued with Orthrelm/Touchdown samples I'd heard from another site...their bass was constantly noodling around with the guitar (the bass being more prominent in this) but it was enough to make me explore this more......well there's no denying that this is complex and all over the place which is nice to hear...but unlike most of the complex music I listen to which is more of a dissonant and frantic and sinister blur...this has alot more of a Jazz funk groove...probably due to the dominance of the bass...but it just doesn't work for me as I don't feel as immersed in this music as other mathcore releases (e.g. Anything by Behold...The arctopus)...it's not that some people can't do the Jazz groove thing well (Don Callebro do a very nice job) but this music is all polyrhythmic with no substance to it's linear structure......very simply...for those who want to hear noodling and are Mick Barr completists...
3,Nurse Betrayed by Jeanne J. Bowman,"Description from the book back cover:Nurse Trudy Holmes left Dane Memorial Hospital to care for the post-operative wife of Dr. Malcolm Morse. Although she hesitated leaving the hospital and the two doctors she loved, Trudy accepted the assignment eagerly, for she had worked so hard putting herself through nursing school and training. However, she didn't count on a pampered young debutante and an old country witch doctor complicating her life. Could Trudy escape with her reputation and her love unscarred? She didn't know ..."
4,Cleanest glasses ever,"I received this as a gift for Christmas 2003. We installed the batteries and the cleaning solution and began to use it. Five of us in the room wore glasses and were all amazed at the difference it made. After six months the lifting mechanism broke. I took it back to Sharper Image and they replaced it immediately and without question. Unfortunately as of December 2004 the lifting mechanism is again malfunctioning. I know Sharper Image will again stand behind the machine but having to take it back again is a hassle. However, the bottom line is that it does such a good job I will put up with the hassle."
4,Edna loves this Flying Fox Bat!,"I love this bat! I collect my favorite animals in plush form and I DEFINATELY wish to say that the Cuddlekins/Wild Republic company really emphasize with the detail in their stuffed animals-this bat is no exception!This bat is modeled from the Flying Bismark Fox Bat that is native to South America. Let me say, this bat is just adorable!! The wings are long and seem to be made with felt (or a combination of felt and cotton) and they are longer than the bat's body, the body is nice and soft, the eyes are cute, and (again) the detail is amazing!I definately recommend this plush to people that enjoy collecting their favorite animals in plush form, and also for children (just please remove the tag if you're giving this to a small child-all Cuddlekins stuffed animals come with one which includes information about the animal it's modeled after)."
5,Batty,"My son learned all about bats in Kindergarten and I thought it would be fun to get him, and his brother, bats for Christmas. They were a BIG hit - with Big Brother telling Little Brother ALL about bats. Now we have two boys talking about echolocation and nocturnal animals. Really fun."
4,Why limit yourself to just the car,"One day after activating the Roady 2, I purchased the home adaptor kit. I haven't turned it off since. As with the roady 2 purchase, this comes with more than enough hookups and accessories that you may or may not need. Turns out that the original antenna worked great inside as well but why disconnect and reconnect everything each time you drive or return home. I placed the antenna on the windowsill and that was it. The bitrate is at zero, my stereo receiver picks up outstanding reception without any additional hookups, as do other radios in the house. It takes up no space and offers such a rewarding experience that you'll be happy to say goodbye to free radio and pay for no commercials and a plethora of listening alternatives."
2,home kit,This product has good intentions but only works under perfect conditions. The antenna is awfully touchy and needs to be placed perfectly to get reception. You have to have it in a South facing window and the house next to you can't block the path of the signal.
3,"Easy to use, but get all the instructions first","First off, I am not a electronics expert but I have connected my DVD, VCR and cable and can program a VCR. So that is my base. I got the Roady and used it in my car. I got the home kit and thought by reading the instructions that it would just plug and play into a CD player or radio. Not quite. It has to have another type of plug (RCA?). Anyway, I was not happy that I had this kit and no where to plug in. I went to xmfan.com and one of the posters mentioned that you could use computer speakers for it. Granted, you are not getting the uber sound that most audiophiles want, but I was happy. I ended up taking the kit to my cube at work and get good reception there. I felt that I was getting more out of my subscription by listening at work all day. I still take the Roady home every night and plug into my car. Think it over and see how it fits in your audio needs."
2,Power adapter doesn't fit Roady,I bought this recently for my XM Roady. The AC/DC power adapter will not fit the Roady. Not even close! Now I have to spend more $$$ to get an adapter that will fit.
5,exquisite teakettle,This is an absolutely exquisite teakettle and matches the fruit motif of my dishes and other kitchen accessories.
4,"Yeah, it's mindless, but hey - I laughed until I cried!","So what if the questions are totally absurd, rude, crude and mindless? It is a great book just for the laughs! Also kind of interesting to see how your answers compare with others."
1,Not worth the money. Avoid this book.,"This book does not provide more than a few moments of entertainment and does not offer any interesting insights into human behavior. Rather than making us wonder about our own limitations and weaknesses, it invites us to normalize our unconventional behavior. By unconventional behavior, I mean behavior that is selfish in motivation and destructive in nature. I am not referring simply to behavior that is bizarre or indecent. Your money would be better spent, if what you'r looking for is humor, on a well-written and humorous novel which makes you laugh while helping you to understand your weaknesses at the same time."
4,Bought this book because I lost my original copy,"Very interesting to see how anonymous people answered these questions - and how you compare. Although I find myself often wishing these were for real prices, ha - I would do ALOT of these things for the money they're offering. If only it was that simple. :P"
5,son will love,I bought this for my 14 year old son for Christmas and after reading some of the questions I know he will enjoy how disgusting some of the questions are in it. They do make you think what you would do for money.
4,my humble opinion:,"This book is a lot of fun. I was worried that the price aspect would take away from my enjoyment but it didn't. My boyfriend and I were cracking up discussing some of the questions and just how little it would take for us to do some of these ""invitations"". Some of the questions made my stomache turn they were so gross. All in all good harmless fun."
5,De vuelta,"La reina del rock esta de vuelta y de que manera!Alejandra despues de varios a?os en drogas ha vuelto totalmente sana y con mas madures! este album lo demuestra! un clasico de Alejandra! de vuelta a las canciones buenas de ellas, el rock clasico de Alejandra is back."
5,Genial!!!,"Este nuevo album de la Guzman no es mas que una indeleble prueva de su talento como una gran cantante del mundo hispano. Alejandra guzman nos brinda en esta reciente produccion canciones de primera, esto, mas la magia de su ronca voz hacen de este album, como de todos sus otros, una genial obra musical. Sin duda la cancion: ""Volverte a amar"" quedara para simpre entre sus grandes exitos."
3,Definitivamente a cambiado.,"De Alejandra Guzman siempre me han gustado sus letras rebeldes, en el nuevo disco Indeleble usa canciones mas romanticas y suaves, definitivamente ha cambiado el estilo por el cual es tan conocida, pero aunque no suene igual, la cancion Volverte Amar es tremendamente bella, solo compre el disco por ella y recibi lo que anhelaba, dicha cancion, pues las demas no poseen nada en especial."
5,The ending will surprise you,"A young detective in New York learns that his ex-girlfriend was murdered at a strip club where she had been dancing. As he investigates, he discovers that her life since they broke up was nothing like he thought. Bit by bit he uncovers the truth about her death and about who she really was. When you get to the ending, it's a real shock. Anyone who likes writers like Lawrence Block or Ross Macdonald should read this one!"
4,"A gripping read, well written if somewhat predictable","This is an excellent book. I couldn't put it down once I'd started. The writing is polished, the characters well-drawn, the plot fast-paced and noirish in a good way. There's action, sex, romance, deduction. Alas, the ending is rather predictable. Still, well worth a read!"
4,One of the best I've seen,"I fell in love with Cassell's after borrowing it from a friend when I first started studying German (thanks Jonathan!). I found it so handy that I was hesitant to give it back when the time came.Here we are three years later and I now score at a high intermediate level, and Cassell's is still my preferred choice, even after using other dictionaries. This dictionary is sturdy (I've only ever had hardback) and I have found that its definitions are, for the most part, contemporary and concise. On a more practical side, the bright red also helps you find it at a glance, and the size is nice.I recommend this to anyone starting out in German."
1,Very poor dictionary--lots of better choices,"Cassell's suffers mainly from being out of date. The vocabulary and idioms are woefully inadequate for most everyday translation activities you might encounter. I recommend the Langenscheidt dictionaries or, better yet, the Collins dictionaries instead--both are a much better value for the money."
3,Good but needs updating,"My main reason for purchasing this dictionary was that it provides pronounciation via the International Phonetic Alphabet for both German -- English and English -- German. It turns out that the print is larger than in most dictionaries -- a definite plus for aging eyes. But even though the listed copyright date is 2002, new words like ""email"" and ""internet"" are not included (in both cases, is it ""der"", ""die"", or ""das""?)."
1,Many words are spelled incorrectly according to current rules,"This dictionary does not use the spelling changes ratified by the governments of Germany, Austria and Switzerland in 1996. So many of the words are spelled incorrectly according to current usage. A reader who understands these changes - which affect many words - would be able to realize when a word is misspelled, so the dictionary would be good for a German speaker who is looking up English words. But for an English speaker looking up German words the dictionary poses a big problem."
5,I have repeated my purchase several times!,I would recommend to people who want to add more fibers to their daily diet. I am taking it everyday!
5,The best I've seen for a beginner and not the most expensive,"Offers a lot of critical points not covered in the other books for beginners I have read. Consistent with lessons from certified instructors and covers more. Extremely comprehensive, still useful after 22 hours on beginner boards and 5 hours of lessons. Great color graphics, quality binding."
5,Rare find!,"Lucky enough to find this book at a Half Price Books for $1.00 (in good shape too!) The cover art and illustrations are beautiful. The book contains basically ""things kids say"". Definitely worth having in your collection."
3,"Good, but not the best...","Since my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I have bought every book I could find about the subject. After devouring each book myself, I pass it along to my mother and siblings to read. I enjoyed <Where's my Shoes> because it gives a truthful and heart-felt account of one woman's situation with her father's Alzheimer's, and shows how the disease not only affects her relationship with her father but also her relationships with her siblings, husband, friends and even her clients. Praise to Avadian for writing about her experiences.That being said (typed), I did not think this was the best account that I have read of the subject. Davidson's book <Alzheimer's: A Love Story> describes the author's experience with her husband's Alzheimers, and is much better written. It gave a much more clear description of the slow decent into Alzheimers, and is a beautiful, almost lyrical book. By all means do buy <Where's my Shoes,> but please consider reading Davidson's book first."
2,Deadly Dull,"Pletnev seems to think that Tchaikovsky's delightful ""The Seasons"" cycle was written by Beethoven in his late period. His performance suffers from an overly serious approach to these light pieces, which Tchaikovsky wrote very quickly and with little effort. Pletnev's tempos in the slow pieces suffer from excessive rubatos and they frequently fall apart. If you want to have music to fall asleep to, listen the very first piece, ""January,"" or even more lazy: ""October."" It is deadly dull, and gets duller as he progresses. His tempos/rubatos are fatal, and destroy the charm of the music. I don't understand why this man is considered a Tchaikovsky expert.... He should be playing late Beethoven Sonatas, not delightful drawing room miniatures!"
2,I was disappointed,"The best piece of artwork in this book is on the cover. Much of it is in black and white which may seem appropriate but which didn't do much to enhance the display of the work. Not at all what I was expecting after the spectacular cover which, to my way of thinking, should represent the meat of the book."
5,Great baby song album.,"This is one of the few good baby song CD's I've come across. I got this CD as a free gift from BabysRUs when my son was 2 or 3 month old, and he loved it right away. I like the fact that the songs are not the same beat-up ""favourites"" you get on every baby CD. They are beautiful and soozing, but they are not really all lullabies. Some are nursery rhymes, some are classical tunes to which the words have been added. They are also short, which is good because babies have short attention span, and are in everyone's voice range, so I can sing along to the baby (my son just loves it when I do that). When you listen to these songs, they sooze rather than put you to sleep, and you don't get tired of them even though my son insists on constantly listening to this CD. I highly recommend this one!"
2,Not her finest novel,"I have read all of Emily Grayson's books and I absolutely loved them....except Night Train to Lisbon. I think Ms. Grayson is a very talented author and her other books really touch my heart. But this latest novel lacked characters that I could like as people. At best, Carson is a charming girl who is stubborn and willful. At worst, she comes off as a rich, priviledged girl who is spoiled rotten and does not bother to concern herself with how others around her feel. Her beau, Alec is also hard to like. He is pushy and helpless and appears to prey on innocent girls. He is a fast mover and seems all wrong for Carson. As for the other characters in the book, Carson's parents and aunt/uncle are boring.I was really quite disappointed in this book. I would suggest that if you read this book or want to read this book, just don't judge the author by this book alone. My favorite book of hers is The Gazebo, followed by The Fountain."
2,Big Bold Lead Paint Warning,"I ordered this plate because it was supposedly an ""appetizer"" plate and I love Department 56. However, when the plate arrived I read the big bold lead paint warning. If you're buying this to serve appetizers, don't -- you'll poison your guests. If you're buying it to be a decorative peice, go for it. It's adorable."
4,Great,"Many people try to cure impotence by different methods which might resemble the torturing methods from the Middle Ages so don't put your health at risk with methods from friends or other strange methods. Curing impotence is a very important issue, but people should know that there are some natural risk free methods that won't have any secondary effects. These methods are described in the book ""Natural Penis Enlargement: New methods of avoiding and curing impotence, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction safely and inexpensively. NEW Secrets that your doctor won't tell you, No Pumps, No Pills and No Gadgets!"" by Platinum Millennium and I recommend it for every guy out there who desperately tries to solve his problem."
2,Not for the Squeamish,"Over the course of reading the 66-page introduction, I came to hate the editor, G. Legman. His egoism comes through even in the scholarly (though curiously uninformative) essay, which is heavily influenced by psychoanalysis, and conveys the vague idea that you should feel guilty for enjoying any of the limericks he's collected, which he considers by and large violent and misogynistic. Many of the limericks are shocking, some more so now than when they were written in the early to mid 20th century (though others, naturally, are far less shocking). They are full of profanity, lewdness, and cringe-inducing injury. But a few are quite clever and amusing. If the anthology had been whittled down by half, and the introduction omitted altogether, this would be an excellent collection of limericks."
4,"No ""clean"" limericks need apply","I found this book after I had read ""Rationale of the Dirty Joke"". As a fan of this poetic form, I have scanned many collections of limericks, but his has to be, by far, the most comprehensive. The introduction explains the origin of the limerick, and the following chapters categorize the limericks by topic, such as excrement, zoophily, abuses of the clergy, organs, etc. The Man from Nantucket, Alice and her dynamite stick and Dave the Hermit are present and accounted for, plus some multi-limerick sagas such as the Farter from Sparta. What you will NOT find is the ""Lady from Niger"", the ""Lady from Guam"", and the clean ""Man from Nantucket"". I have seen a shorter, less complete book attributed to G. Legman. Don't bother with that one- this is the book to have."
4,wrapping,"the product was a gift. it was wrapped in a plastic, and when my daughter un wrapped it , it tore the paper cover off."
4,Enjoyable read,"Willy Ley has obviously done an enormous amount of homework before writing these essays, but he presents his ideas in a readable and often humorous format. Although many years have passed since first publication, this book remains pertinent and fascinating--recommended."
2,Original artists?,"I well remember the original St. Louis Jesuits songs. Of the twelve songs on this CD, it seems like half a dozen are the original songs. The rest appear to be performances of some unnamed choir and orchestra. Needless to say, I am not happy with this purchase through Amazon."
2,Predictably boring,This book probably would have been better if it wasn't the 3rd book i've read about 2 girls trying to escape communism or poverty. It's the same story one of the parents are in danger of being kiled by the government takes off leaves the family the family then meet him in an isolated village of some sort they then find out the town is in danger so they move across a border riskking their lives yet again and in the end they move to a stable home where they live hapily ever after.Have i missed anything out and i didn't even finish it so please tell me if i'm wrong
5,KISS THE DUST.,I thought KISS THE DUST was a very good book. It's about a girlnamed TARA and her family. One afternoon a soldier comes to their house. TARA's father was sick. The solier tells BABA the police are looking for him.SO they have to move away from their home.Most of the book is about them moving around the world and their problems.
4,Kiss the Dust,I did this book for a school project. It really had all the information I needed. It is a really good book that I loved to read. I read a lot of books so I can pick out which books are good and which books I don't like. This book is really good and will always stay in my mind. It is about a young girl who has to flee because she is Kurdistan and the Kurdish people are fighting against the Iraqi government. Her father is also fighting and the government is out to kill him. The whole family flees to a place they've hardly ever been.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!,"Kiss the Dust is an incredibly boring book. I did not like it, I hated it! I would never reccomend this book to any teachers, children, or teenagers!"
4,Excellent Book!!,"Tara, a girl risking her life by fleeing from country to country, will never have a home. Tara's dad is in trouble and the police are looking for him. Their family escapes to camps until they get to Iran. Tara's brother, Asher goes to the war with their uncle. Will Tara get to Iran? Will Asher come home from the war? Check out the book and find out."
1,Its better for people which like war books.,"I do not belive in war and so when I read this book in english and I personally did not enjoy it but, if you like war stories then you would like the book. The pace of the book is quite good with a little action for what I like. Personally this was the worst book that I have ever read. The thing is maybe it should be aimed at older people 16+."
3,"Good teaching, needs a set-up","I think the teacher gives good tutorial and breaks down the moves well. He's a bit talkative but is interesting to listen to and stays within the subject. He has all the elements to create a series of good DVDs on this dance but has to work on the set-up and sound. Maybe make it a little less homemade and add quality. I've learned many dances and work-outs from DVDs. Good music coming out clear is at least 70% of the enjoyment and is an excellent motivator to return to it frequently. I just love to watch poppers and their moves seem so mystical. Otis makes them accessible and his personal experience as someone who isn't necessarily a ""natural"" and needed to practice hard to learn the moves is encouraging for those who begin or have barriers to cross.One last thing, his clothing should be a bit less baggy so we can see better the muscle movements."
3,Pretty good read,"I quite enjoyed this book. Good plot, if a bit obvious at times. Well written. And the characterizations of the major players felt right."
2,A bad follow up to other books,Again the books were lost. Cardassian focus. Mixed crisises. Focus on a character that hadn't bene focused on in a book yet seemed to be the choice but in the end that didn't necessary mean it was a hood thing.
1,Technopop music extravaganza!,"5 Stars! I am an SBL fan since their first CD/DVD. The combination of a band coming from different cultures and experiencing a unique sound is always very apprecitted in our every day. Geri Soriano being a native from my country the Dominican Republic has great talents in writting the songs along with the other band members, she has a great voice to listen to. I recommend this DVD to any one who struggles in the search of great music. There are three songs with an interview of recent band tour trips made in Brazil, I only wished their record company could supply more interesting and better budget videos for the band.I was very surprised with SBL being part of the soundtrack for the movie the Sweetest Thing. Their dance mixes are very well made."
5,my first book,"I learned to read with this book and am now purchasing it for my children. I continued to read this book and immerse myself in the fantastic world of flat cat into my teenage years and I can directly connect it to a lifelong love of richly colored graphic novels telling fantastic urban tales featuring animals in grand adventures. Imagine my disappointment when I arrived at first grade that fall and was confronted with the most drab adventures of dick and jane. Ugh, I cannot recommend a book any more highly than Flat Cat for readers of any age."
5,smooth tune,"Tuned my wrangler several weeks ago, and it has run beautifully. I feel this is the best way to do a tune-up and have no problems during the life of the product. It eliminates all potential problems with the electrical portion of the tune-up. Will definitely use the product again."
1,Amateurish but enthusiastic,"Mostly mediocre photos and some marginal advice. Spend two minutes looking at the pictures then move on. An example of some circular logic from chapter 3 you can do without:""Because wide-angle lenses record more of an area when shooting large groups of people, they allow you to move in close and still get everyone in the shot, ensuring that people in the shot will not diminish in size. If you used a lens with a longer focal length, you would have to move back to get everyone in the shot and they would appear smaller in size.""If you're after solid advice on technique you would be better served by a book such as The Ansel Adams Guide : Book 1 : Basic Techniques of Photography."
1,Genuinely bad,"There is some good advice in this book... which can also be found in any general photography text. Unfortunately there is also advice that is plain wrong. The pictures are unimaginative. A large proportion are fisheye pictures of the worst kind... ""look, the building is curved!"". The really bizarre part is Appendix B: ""Nikon Wide angle lenses"", which is a list of... Nikon wide angle lenses. What anyone is supposed to do with this, I don't know. Don't buy this book. Any good general photography book will teach you more about the use of wide angle lenses."
4,Really use that wide angle lens,"A bit dated, only reason for not getting a fifth star. Inspirational. Will have you using the w/a lense characteristics to their fullest. Think perspective stretching, emphasizing near subjects, showing relationships between many equal subjects, hand hold low shutter speeds etc"
5,Most underrated country artist of the 90s,"Although George had hits with two of the tracks from this CD, ""Teardrops"" and ""Lipstick Promises,"" the album never got the attention it deserved due to some breakdowns at his record label. Every song on this CD is a winner and George truly showcases his gift for writing great melodies and lyrics. If you like guitar-driven music, you'll love this record. Favorite cuts are ""Lipstick Promises,"" ""My World Stopped Turning,"" ""Hello Cruel World,"" and ""Kisses Don't Lie."" George went on to write songs for the Dixie Chicks, Gary Allan, Garth Brooks and Radney Foster."
4,"Jimi speaking, catogorized by subject from various interviews","It's actually a great idea. Go over a variety of Jimi's actual interviews and make them into a book. Mr. Brown obtains the material from a variety of interviews with Jimi. The only weak link of this book is that none of those interviews, from what I could see, are cited in the book. Other than that, hearing Jimi speak, in print, is a very nice read. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
4,good size,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our son-in-law. Good size, bright colors. Only negative is that it was not packaged good enough. It was a little bent when it arrived."
3,Spearhead,"This is a TOUGH game/add on. There are portions of this game that will frustrate you a great deal......as some sections have no 'health' boosters and the enemy seems to be everywhere. No doubt a great deal of fun, but it is NOT as 'easy' as Allied Assault."
1,Will Not Work on Modern Macs,"This game does not work on Macs with Intel chips. Before you buy, check your machine."
3,nastalgic play,"i can see why this game was loved so much in the past. an incredible story, anime style cut scenes and a nice turned based real time blattles. if your into old classics rpg's this game is great."
1,Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!,this product is waste of money and not worth the price. i bought a book-light for $2 and it gives MORE light and more stylish than this cheap quality product.
5,Works Great for Reading!,I use this light at night to read my kindle. Its not so bright where it disturbs my other half when he's trying to go to sleep. Instead it focuses the light really well where I want. Its easy to adjust and simple to use. Unlike other kindle lights that clip on this light doesn't add any additional weight to your kindle and you can barely feel it in your ear.
2,Wish it lasted longer,Was a great little light bought it for my wife for Christmas for cross stitch batteries lasted about a week when I replaced the batteries it quit working may have just been defective but was very disappointing
3,good design but poor battery life,"it fits comfortably over your ear. the switch to turn off/on the light is somewhat tight...could be less tight. i didn't use it much...not a big reader. after sitting in my nightstand drawer for 1 - 1.5 years of very little use the battery died, which was somewhat surprising."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I had a wonderful LED ear lite, that broke and that I can't locate to purchase again. So, I tried this one. I was quite disappointed. This one is very uncomfortable to wear (the ear piece is hard plastic and unless I am missing something, can only be worn on the right ear). The on/off switch is surprisingly loud in the middle of the night when I am trying to read next to my wife in bed. The light, although quite bright which is nice, is too narrow of a beam. You have to keep moving your head all over to see the entire page. It would be nice if there was some type of diffuser to make the light broader."
2,"Let there be light--MORE light, please!","This is a great idea but there are better competitors on the market, and for about the same price or a little more. The best thing about this model is that it has a positive-click on/off switch that won't turn on accidentally in your luggage. The worst: not enough light to read by. Too bad!"
2,Don't bother,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. It has a nice target light, but it does not stay on your ear and it's uncomfortable. Don't waste your money."
3,Probably worth buying,"I got a grand total of six of these after Hurricane Ike took our power out for four days. (Yes, we got clobbered by Ike in Kentucky, Google if you doubt it!) It is almost a must have for fumbling around in a dark house at night; great for walking around the house without running into things. I also used it extensively for reading during the power outage; I would have gone nuts just sitting in the dark. This thing doesnt give a the greatest light, but it is certainly adequate and when one is without power it can be really cherished. I got all of mine, on two separate occasions, at K-mart in the automotive section (I guess its supposed to be a map reader).....for five bucks. No way would I pay [...] . And yes, I got the exact same light. I would look for it elsewhere cheaper."

3,"Good, but cut scenes","Good movie, but I didnt like that some scenes were cut such as the trip from the airport to the desert"
4,Great product!,THE GOOD:I was looking for dryer sheets that could be used for baby laundry (sensitive skin) and that smelled great too! This one has baby scent which makes his clothes smell awesome. Also leaves them cuddly soft. :)THE BAD:I do have to throw in at least 3 sheets for each load because I've found 1 sheet isn't strong enough (scent-wise) for medium sized load of baby laundry.OVERALL:Fulfills it's purpose. I will buy more of this once I'm through with the 2-pack I have.
2,I thought this was a book.,I bought this book thinking it was a novel but it's a screenplay. I tried to read it once but it's to difficult.
3,Great music,"Forget the plot, Henry Fonda and the rest of the cast. Listen to Lily Pons sing ""The Jockey on the Carousel"". Unforgettable! The blues number ""I got Love"" is amusing too as Pons's French accent mangles the lyrics but that last note she hits is extraordinary. Jerome Kern wrote the songs and the score should be better remembered. There is also an early appearance by Lucille Ball who is shrill and funny.Thank goodness we have this film memorial of Lily Pons."
1,Lhasa Apro DVD review. Big dissapointment,"The film only showed one Lhasa Apso young puppie with only elementary information about the breed. Although a cute puppie there were no film of other puppies or mature Lhasas with different color schemes not aging Lhasas were shown. The short training tips segment were pretty nice but not related specifically to Lhasas. Finally, the bonus segment showing a several dogs of different breed's running wild and barking in an obviously residental area. I was not only silly and annoying but also an approval of dog's running loose where they most likely by law should controlled by being on a leash.BK"
5,Aggression,This text is just one of many of the Bandura must haves as it relates to the study of aggression and aggressive behavior in both adult and youthful offenders.
3,posset-ively mediocre,"A slick mousse and an embarrassing take-off(plagarism?)of Mostly Martha, the delightful original. Buy a copy of MM and wait until No Reservations is on cable."
3,"OK as food movie, weak ""cover"" of ""Mostly Martha""","I'm not a huge fan of remade movies, and this one reinforces my bias.For me, this tried too hard to parallel MM (in some places almost word for word) while showing a shinier, ""Hollywood-er"" version of the story.Not too bad if you haven't seen MM, but NOWHERE near as good a cover as, for example, ""Tortilla Soup"" following on ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"""
2,Lacklustre,"I like both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart but they don't come across well in this film. She's stiff and unlikable, and he just doesn't fit the role of a passionate, opera-loving chef. Neither actor is helped by the fact that this movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be. It jumps haphazardly from drama to cliched scenes of pillow fighting and a particularly banal clip of a desperate Zeta-Jones interviewing a quick succession of odd looking people for a chef's job, which I assume was meant to be funny. Frankly I'm surprised it's tagged as a romantic comedy as there was very little to laugh about or find lovey dovey, although I did I cringe a few times.I watched this movie on cable and I'm glad I never paid for the privilege. It's predictable Hollywood guff."
3,better than I thought,"Unlike some romantic comedies, this movie has some depth to it. The female lead is flawed, and remains so throughout the film, but that doesn't prevent her character from growing enough to move the plot forward. Her neice, likewise, undergoes reactions to her mother's death and her new circumstances that are more realistic than some other films that use a newly-orpaned kid as a prop. Eckhart's character might be a little too long-suffering to believe, but he has an understated charm that is infectious - I tried hard not to like him. This type of movie might not be my preference, but I enjoyed it."
3,No Reservations.,I bought this for a friend for Valentine's Day. It's a great movie. Super adorable. He loves it. It's one of his favorite movies.
2,"A poor remake of ""Mostly Martha""","I absolutely loved ""Mostly Martha"" and therefore was a bit sceptical about a remake to begin with - unfortunately this version didn't even come close. It has none of the warmth of the original. And it totally lacked the intriguing dialog and relationship between niece and aunt. Although I liked all actors in other movies - here they just failed."
1,unconscionably awful,"Like many reviewers, I choose to write about films or music that I like. Not this time.No Reservations MIGHT have gotten two stars from me if I hadn't seen Mostly Martha -- Catherine ZJ is easy on the eyes, though less so in htis movie... But this remake is slavishly true to its inspiration, even to the music, while lacking all real emotion or strength. And given that Mostly Martha is a remarkable movie, how could this movie ever have been made? Some sense of self-respect should have moved all involved in this version to petition to have their names removed from the credits.Mostly Martha is funny at times, and tremendously powerful at others -- it's a sympathetic portrayal of grief and compulsiveness, all shown with such restraint that its impact is intensified. Martina Gedeck, as she proved in Lives of Others, is a tremendous actress. And the little girl is really good.So either see Mostly Martha and skip this, or never see Mostly Martha so this won't be so awful."
3,Lightweight and a bit dour,"Zeta-Jones plays a somewhat mentally disturbed chef here who is saddled with raising her late sister's child, but doesn't know how. The movie can't decide if it's a comedy or a melodrama, so every time it flags you get a large dose of cute from the child in question. There's a love story here somewhere, too, naturally, but it lacks much heat. This was a summer movie and that's what it remains. Just okay."
3,Like German Movie,"This is just like the German movieMostly MarthaBut as it is in American movies compared to European movies, it tries to focus more on the romance, less on the depth of Martha's psychosis, so it just makes it less of a romantic comedy and a little darker... is it a romantic comedy or what--this movie should have been more focused...If you like cooking movies, check outRatatouille"
3,Realistic and simplistic subdued,"I watched this DVD one afternoon and it was enjoyable, a pleasant time passer. It kept my attention, the little girl was adorable. Zeta-Jones was good in her role, but subdued. It was a good story, but too smooth. Somehow I don't see a young girl transitioning to a new Mommy this easily. It's cute, sweet, sentimental, but not fully realistic. I wouldn't pass it up though, it's a good watch."
5,Wonderful Movie,No Reservations if one of those classic type movies that I can watch multiple times and never tire of it. Great movie. There should be more like it.
3,A Familiar Taste...,"No Reservation starts out good enough, depicting a head chef who cares about nothing more than the fact that the food gets out of the kitchen, and that the diners enjoy the food, almost to a fault.However, as No Reservation unfolds, it reveals a predictable plot that may find you asking; ""have I seen this before?""The leads, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin, all turn in very good performances, especially Breslin, who acts with ability beyond her years. However, even good players can't save a bad play, and such is the case with this film. There are points in the film where you will actually say the next line before it was uttered...that's how predictable it is.It was enjoyable, to a certain extent, but unless you are an avid food (or Eckhart) lover, it won't leave much of an impression."
3,"A nice little movie, no more & no less","A pleasant, entertaining remake of the 2001 German-language film, ""Mostly Martha"". Slicker and less complex than the original film, ""No Reservations"" is nevertheless warmly filmed and warmly acted, and will capably provide an evening of quality home entertainment to those who take the plunge. Appealing actors, many ""joy of good food"" moments, a few misty-eyed scenes, later happy developments, what more can one want? Every movie doesn't have to be dense and complex. The DVD features excellent picture and sound, and a twenty-minute ""behind the scenes of the film"" piece that originally appeared (appropriately enough) on the Food Channel."
4,"Sweet, but not as good as the original","I really enjoyed this movie. It's light, but has some emotional depth. It's sweet, but not cloying. It's fun, but no comedy. The soundtrack is playful and serious - opera and easy-listening, just like the movie.However, I have to agree with other reviewers that the German original, Bella Martha, was superior in it's nuanced performance.If you won't watch movies with subtitles and want a relatively clean (only suggested intimacy, nothing visible), sweet romance to watch on chick-flick night, this is a good choice. If you want a more subtle, endearing version of the film - watch the original. I own the original and borrow the remake :-)"
5,Love this movie,We bought this for my birthday in 2008..I love to watch it over and over..Very funny and has a tear jerking part..
4,Pretty Good,Good chemistry between the co-stars. Eckhart is a hottie. The little girl really adds to the plot and it all revolves around how something good can happen from tragedy
3,Touching,"This is a touching film with very little vulgarity and no immodesty. The acting and directing is great, but the boundaries on proper conduct in a relationship before marriage are not clearly made, so I might not suggest this because of that, especially for children. Other than that, the movie was very touching."
4,Nice romantic dramedy,"I was entranced enough by this film's trailers to actually go see it in a theater. I enjoyed watching it, as it didn't stray from the romantic dramedy formula at all. Great acting by all, and some good one liners that you can take away with you."
3,I would have not keep it in my collection,"It was a good for a sunday's afternoon but it's not a keeper for me. Just not my kind of movie, I guess."
2,Expected more!,"With such a good cast, I expected a knock out, romantic comedy. Turned out to be a depressing movie with some light heartedness, humor and romance.Don't be fooled by the cast or reviews. That seen where she slams the raw steak on the customers table, is actually part of the ending.2 Thumbs down!"
2,Not a fun movie!!!,This movie isn't fun and I thought it was interested but nothing. Also they acting were so unsatified. Unfortunately this movie hmm I can say it's not perfect.
2,Wish for More,"It has its moments and the major cast members are great, but it's so predictable that even they seem bored with it. It's cute, yes, and worth a one-time viewing, but it could have been so much more."
2,No Reservations - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 2.40:1VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3Running time: 1:44:18Movie size: 16,15 GBDisc size: 20,04 GBAverage video bit rate: 17.53 MbpsDolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsDolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsDolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbpsNumber of chapters: 24Subtitles: English / English SDH / French / Spanish#Food Network: Unwrapped - episode (hosted by Marc Summers - 23 min)#Emeril Live - talk show episode (HD - hosted by Emeril Lagasse - 45 min)"
1,What a sad copy of a tasteful original,"The original - Bella Martha - is a very tasteful (not superior but touching) German movie with actual people, somewhat melancholic but still a comedy (the soft, melancholic humor suits the story so much better than slapstick humor). Don't watch this, get the original. When comparing these two versions of the same story (in every detail), you can see a vast difference which, for me, lies mostly in the ""reality"" of the movie. In ""Bella Martha"" I ""buy"" it, the characters, the plot, the setting. In ""No Reservations"" it's all fake and funny, funny, funny."
1,Lackluster imitation,"Skip this one and rent ""Mostly Martha"" instead - bite the bullet, read the subtitles. It's worth it. ""Without Reservation"" is, without reservation, only a shallow imitation of the superb German film, starring the stellar Martina Gedeck (The Lives of Others). Together, with a equally great supporting cast, the story comes alive, not forced or contrived. ""Without Reservation"" does little or nothing to engage the viewer except maybe for the palate."
1,See the original instead,"You can watch this movie, or you can watch the original (Mostly Martha). Sure, its in German. Yeah, you'll have to read subtitles. But I'd rather do that the watch this pathetic, American remake. This movie is a true example of why some movies should not be remade. Enjoy the original and pitch this one in the garbage."
2,A predictable story but enjoyable to watch.,"This is one time when two chefs in the kitchen do not ruin the stew. An opportunity for you to see how hectic it can be in a professional kitchen. Loved the way Jones finally resolves the ""rare steak"" issue with a customer. Blu-ray is great."
3,Chef gets a life,"Catherine Zeta-Jones plays an uptight chef who is totally in charge of the kitchen where she works. She thinks that her life is tightly controlled, yet she is in therapy. Add one orphaned niece and a free-spirited, opera-loving sous chef and suddenly her life changes drastically. This is a pleasant movie--light and entertaining--but nothing you can't predict shortly after these two characters are introduced. The high points are the kitchen scenes and Abigail Breslin playing the part of the niece like the old soul that she is."
4,Loved..,"Catherine in this one, and how much tension there was between her and the male lead. It doesn't hurt either that she's in a chef's jacket (I love women in chefs jackets, think they're pretty hot in them)."
5,Great Movie!,I had seen this movie on Netflix and loved so much just had to buy it. The soundtrack is awesome and gave me a whole new appreciation for opera.
3,Even tho I bought it don't think I would buy it again It was okay,I bought it and have watched it but not really like it I don't think I would buy it again
3,So-So Romantic-Comedy/Chick Flick,"I've seen better romantic comedies/chick flick then this one. This movie was billed as a romantic-comedy, but wasn't very comedic as it deals with death/loss/grief and other life issues. Overall this movie is predictable, which made it both boring and slow. Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones character is pretty flat and one dimensional.... I think there could have been more substance overall in the storyline to make this a better movie."
2,completely predictiable,Wow this was just far too predictable. Once you get past the fact that you know exactly what's going to happen- it's a cute movie.
3,Just okay...,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on this. The plot is wholly predictable though well acted. It hardly qualifies as a romantic comedy because it simply isn't funny. Kate's character arch does allow her to let people in, but I'm not sure how she got so closed off-especially since her sister seemed quite the opposite. There was no real obstacle keeping these two from each other and what paper thin conflict they did have is resolved rather effortlessly."
2,No Reservations,I just couldn't kept my train of thought in this movie. Too much was left to try to figure out on your own.
4,No reservations here,"I guess I'm glad I never saw the foreign version of this movie because I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a sweet movie with a good overall story line. Aaron & Abigail were great in it and Catherine did a decent job too. As a wannabe foodie, I also enjoyed all the focus on the food. I actually had not heard much about this movie and I know the reviews were not stellar so maybe that's why I was pleasantly surprised by it."
4,No reservations,"AS I bought this movie I still had Ratatouille in Mind. I don't know a lot of movies based on restaurants, actually Ratatouille, American Cuisine (fabulous) and this One. The Movie is great with a good theme and story, enjoy it at home at all costs."
2,Beauty is only skin deep,"Yes, it is beautiful but it's poorly designed. The sprayer sticks on and the pressure from the main spout was so low I thought it must be plugged up somewhere. I haven't solved the sprayer problem yet but the low pressure at the spout was caused by the diverter valve which is designed to save water by restricting flow(which doesn't happen because you have to let it run for twenty minutes before the water gets hot). I removed the diverter and pulled the plastic center piece out with needle nose pliers and then drilled some small holes in the plastic around the brass stem. Now water flows through the holes instead of being restricted and it works great. The spout doesn't shut off when you use the sprayer but the sprayer still works like before(It won't shut off)."
1,Good faucet - bad sprayer,"The faucet works well - however, we're on our 3rd sprayer. The 1st, the diverter leaked. The 2nd, the handle (that you squeeze) fell off. The 3rd - will not release and return water to the main faucet. Nothing but a pain."
1,A lot of money for a non-working faucet,"Bought this before we built our house so it was about out of warranty when we first turned it on. The sprayer never, ever worked more than just a drizzle. It was so expensive that I didn't want to just throw it away but I'm getting close now. Just wish I spent $50 on a piece of garbage instead of $200. ""You get what you pay for"" does not work here."
1,a piece of junk,"After four years of replacing parts and trying to get this faucet (in the stainless finish) and sprayer to work acceptably, we give up. We bought and installed a new faucet to replace it. (NOT a Price Pfister!)It's such a shame, because I love the style and it still looks good. However, the water pressure had gotten worse and worse with time, and no amount of replacing parts helped much. The sprayer dribbles, even after cleaning it and replacing the diverter. My parents 30 year old faucet works better!It's a piece of junk wrapped in a pretty package. Don't waste your money - you will soon be disappointed."
1,Piece of junk!,"We bought this faucet about one year ago and had it professionally installed by a licensed plumber. It worked fine for about three months but then everything began to break. First, the cold/hot water selector went -- it constantly became lose and had to be tightened and retightened every other week. Now, it is every week - it becomes so lose it is impossible to use. Next, the soap dispenser suddenly stopped pumping soap and no longer works. Finally, the water sprayer handle sticks and doesn't shut itself off. We are in the process of trying to get a refund from the company but we are out of the cost for installation. Don't buy this product ... it is expensive crap!"
1,Same problems...,"Also have the same problems with the connector, sprayer, and soap dispenser. Pretty ridiculous for such an expensive item. Boo Price Pfister."
1,biggest piece of junk we ever owned,"on my third pump head for the soap dispenser, they just ""snap off"" after a couple of months and soap dribbles all over the place. the faucet will not stay on, the handle slowly falls by itself until it shuts off. the sprayer handle sticks and boy does that give you a start when you crank the water on and it sprays in your face, all over the cabinets, walls, floor....I cant say enough things to accurately describe what a piece of junk this is. Looking desperately for a replacement that will fit the pre-drilled holes now in our sink (4)."
1,Do not buy!,"Like most other reviewers, we have had our faucet for a few years. We have had the soap dispenser replaced. It did not dispense soap. The sprayer works well but the base has broken two times. The worst part is the diverter. The presser was so low, we thought it was clogged. It took us several months to determine the issue the first time. Since then, when the pressure is low, we just contact the company for a replacement part. We are on our third one. Love the look, hate the product; will never purchase another Price Pfister product again. Be careful!"
1,poor reliability,We have had this faucet with sprayer installed about 6 months. The sprayer has started sticking on and the sprayer handle (which is plastic) falls off. Currently the sprayer is stuck in the on position and we can't use our faucet. I would definitely not purchase this product again.
4,It depends on your idea of quiet,"I wanted a new hairdryer because the two previous hairdryers that I owned were so loud that I never wanted to use them. This hairdryer is extremely quiet on the low setting, but it will not dry my hair at all on this setting. There is no medium setting, which is disappointing because the high setting is pretty loud. However, the high setting does dry my hair very quickly so I can't complain as I have very thick hair. It is quieter than my previous hair dryers (both 4+ years old), so it is an improvement for me, but if you are looking for something very quiet and have thick hair, this is probably going to disappoint you."
4,Good surge protector for the money,"For the money, this is a good surge protector. It is a 1080 Joules protector even though the title says 750. It has 150V clamping voltage with less than 1 nanosecond response time (I had to find the response time on the vendor's web site). I bought one to see it in person. The plastic casing had some irregularities in it, but otherwise I was impressed. My biggest complaint is that it is made in China. I like that it comes with $20,000 worth of equipment guarantee with no forms to fill out and if the ""Protected LED"" ever goes out, they claim they will replace if free."
4,Mitey-Knife,I love this knife. I was buying a replacement for one I have used daily for about 2 1/2 years. My only complaint would be I wish the part on the inside that holds the razor blade was metal not plastic. That is what wore out on my first knife.
2,No focus,"I was looking forward to this book coming out as the other books in the series are great. However, this book covers too many openings and as a result lacks focus. Covered in this book is the Queens gambit declined and all resulting variations (orthodox, tartakower, cambridge springs, exchange, etc.), Tarasch defence, Queens Gambit Accepted, Slav and Semi-Slav. The end product provides little coverage of any lines in these families. This is unlike the other books in teh series (Caro-Kann and KID) which provide a great introduction to an opening system and provides a great starting point for an opening repetoire. The writing is good, but the book is not helpful. A better approach would have been a starting out book covering QGD or Slav individually."
4,Ok book (Please mind my spelling),"""Creepy Stuff"" opened my eyes and my mind to a world full of just so...""Creepy Stuff!"" I was enlightened with the facts, stories, and pictures. I learned a lot from that book while broadining my thinking skills. (though I might not have that many)And even though I got many of the trivia questions wrong, it was a great experience to read this book...Believe it!"
3,TOO SMALL!,"I got the book and it was smaller then I expected. I mean I thought it would of been the size of a ""normal"" book, but it wasnt. However, the book is very good and fun for kids! I got it for a Christmas present and I hope he'll be happy with it. What I mean is you know how kids like ""big"" things, this is just really small. Im sure he will like the facts :)O yea and its not in color. Only the bonus pages are color and thats only 3 pages."
4,informative and pleasing to nonfiction readers,"In recent move for consilience of the sciences, I found myself in search of ""A Gardener Touched with Genius: the Life of Luther Burback"". He has made tremendous changes in American and international fruit and vegetable variety and acceptance. As physician I must say this improves our nutritional choices. I was thrilled to see the photograph of Luther Burbank together with Henry Ford and with Hugo de Vries in California. Hugo de Vries of the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands brought to light the writings of Gregor Mendel, furthered the genetic research, and wrote on Mutation theory in 1910. The life of Luther Burbank is good reading and will encourage future scientists to reach out and ask questions."
5,Understandable and entertaining,"K.C. Cole certainly knows how to write. More importantly, she knows how to choose her subjects well. I marveled over each of her 90+ essays and her ability to make mundane objects fascinating (think clouds, mountains, and pianos), and fascinating objects comprehensible (quarks, the Higgs boson, muons, and black holes). No mathematical aptitude necessary. A basic understanding of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity and some quantum physics is helpful.The author elegantly communicates the very essence of science. In this light, one can also describe ""Mind Over Matter"" as an interesting treatise on philosophy. Savor each essay slowly, a few at a time. Or read the entire book in one sitting, as I did."
2,Science dumbed down,"""Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."" When she wrote these pieces, Cole clearly wasn't following Einstein's adage."
2,This book did not hold my attention,"I'm sure for many truly seeking to learn more about Abraham and how his life can be a lesson to us in our walk with God, this will be a good book.For me I just wasn't that interested in the subject matter and did not finish the book.The author seemed to write well I just didn't have much desire to read nearly 300 pages about Abraham anymore than I would reading about Moses, Thomas Jefferson, or Dolley Madison."
5,Life Lessons through the story of Abraham,"Anne Graham Lotz, Billy Graham's daughter, is an amazing writer! In this book, she focuses on Abraham and follows his life from Genesis 12 through Genesis 24. It is not simply a commentary on these chapters of the Bible - it is a very personal story from Anne's heart. She shares many examples from her own life, which makes the reader feel an intimacy with both Anne and Abraham. This book will spur YOU on in your journey to ""The Magnificent Obsession"", which is a Jesus-filled life!"
3,"Eh, its ok, but I like my tripplite powerstrip better","I bought this and a tripplite powerstrip to try to solve my power block issues, but like the tripplite *much* more - this thing is big and ugly, the tripplite sidles 24 *spaced* outlets right up tight against the wall - more expensive but well worth it - it may be the last power strip you ever need."
5,Koopsta is the Best,This ablum is incredible. Koopsta Knicca is one of the most unique artists is music. He delivers the best lyrics in the best way on this one. Get this ablum!
5,Koopsta is the best rapper alive/and underrated,The best ablum u can buy this year! haloween/fiya/whup dat b.
1,koopsta can do alot better,Koopsta knicca is one of my favorite rappers but this album just didnt do it. He's sounds alot softer now and his first album the devils playground was 3x as good.
2,100 Words,"Some words are wonderful to know. Others are once-in-a-lifetime kind of words and they should not really be included as one of the 100 words. And some of the examples they use by quoting actual text from old writings do not make these words any more useful in the modern context. Over all, not very useful."
4,This is Fun,"I enjoy this book. I just place it somewhere where one of us (my family) might sit down to relax, and it's fun to pick up and page through. Often I learn a new word -- or a more accurate definition/new usage for a word I already use.It's inexpensive fun."
1,This is a waste,"This book was a waste. If it were better written, it could be reduced to 5 pages and not lose any of the words."
1,100 Words Every Word Lover Knows,Word lovers know or should know almost every word in this book. It's really a book for people who don't love words but think they want to. The format is good and the price is right. Maybe it's a good stocking stuffer for a young person who likes to read and write.
5,JADE WOMAN,"MANY GOOD REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK...I AGREE WITH ALL...ONLY COMMENTS THAT THIS IS HIS BEST BOOK, SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST BOOK BY HIM..I HOPE THE REMAINDER I WILL READ, WILL NOT BE TOO MUCH OF A LET DOWN...HE DID GOOD JOB WITH HK"
1,Wrong description,"HI, this tv series with 26 episodes I believe refers to the White Fang series from 1993 and not the 2000 series that stars Nick Mancuso and Shane Meier. Both series are being released at the same time at the same price. This one has 26 episodes and the series of Call of The Wild has 13 episodes and is the one as described in this write out."
3,Not Sure What To Make Of It,"To be frank, I only bought this CD because I was curious to see what type of music Johnny Depp would play. I don't know much about alternative music. I didn't hate the CD but I had a great deal of difficulty figuring out alot of the lyrics and I guess I am one of those people who wants to ""understand"" the lyrics. Some of the music I liked and some of it sounded exactly like what my grandchildren play on my keyboard and they are only 5 and 6. What do I know, maybe they should have their own CD too. But in the end, the big test is that I put 3 of the songs on my iPod, which is why I gave it 3 stars."
5,A Great CD,This is definitly a great cd. This deserves 6 stars! Who wouldn't love Johnny playing the gutair?
1,Totally unoriginal and uninspired,"Like Johnny Depp? Like music? Then there's no reason at all to buy this. In fact I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.I'm sorry but this must be the least inspired record I've ever heard. There are only two songs that are mildly entertaining (I Save Cigarette Butts and The Deal), the rest is...well it's crap really.There are a couple of overly long tracks that unsuccessfully toy with studio manipulation (Zing Splash , John Glenn ,and Scraping from Ring). I can't call it anything other than pure filler.There's the Abba cover (C'mon guys!), there's a totally unoriginal and uninspired blues song, there's a totally unoriginal and uninspired country song, and there's a totally unoriginal and uninspired ballad.Hey, you know what this album is?"
5,Another family favorite!,"My grandchildren love this CD....and so do their parents. Great for long car rides, or just for fun!"
2,Overview only w/ basic info you probably already know,Book is an overview w/basic information that most speech pathologist already know. It provides an overview of home health but does not go in depth into information on how this system works or things you will need to know if you have never worked in this area. Not worth the money I paid for it.
3,Fine acting from Andrews despite mediocre film making,"I watched this film mainly to see Giuseppe Andrews, and for that reason I am not wholly disappointed in this otherwise crude indie. I agree with the previous reviewer in that the drug addict story is certainly becoming almost mundane. Andrews is a wonderful actor (and an up-and-coming film director in his own right). But appreciating Andrews' abilities is often a chore given the distractions of the movie's almost embarrassingly low-budget look: the videotape footage, the unimaginative time-lapse photography, the near-nonstop profanity, and the utterly hilarious use of blurred spots to hide Andrews' private parts during nude scenes."
1,Don't bother,"There's a difference between an indie film and a low budget film. This film is neither. This is guerilla filmmaking without the growl.The script is juvenile and the acting is largely jaw-droppingly bad. It feels like a high school kid's video project.The male privates are digitally blurred out, which makes this ""indie"" film seem laughingly tame at the same time as it purports to be an ""in your face"" look at crystal meth addiction and yadda yadda yadda.The lead character is so revolting that it is impossible to muster any sympathy for him. The sex scenes are juvenile and unnecessary.If you must get this film then make sure you've got a table or chair that has one wonky leg. You'll want to use the DVD case to prop it up when you've cursed yourself for getting this film."
1,Deceived,"This famous story of Peter and the Wolf has been enjoyed by young and old alike since it was written, enjoyed to teach youngsters the instruments in an orchestra has been ruined in its retelling by Ian Beck. Trying to make it politically correct destroys the story. Amazon failed to warn customers of this. Since it would cost more to return it for a refund than the book cost, I guess I will just use it for fire fuel and search for the real story. In his effort to ""save"" the bad wolf, Beck imprisons the poor victim duck forever in the belly of the evil wolf The revision stinks."
1,Peter and the Wolf,Horrible!!!! Took forever to get here. It was new but paperback when I was led to believe it would be a hardback.I would never order from these folks again.
5,Am I the only one who actually liked this CD!!??,"I think THANK YOU is a great CD!! There were a couple of songs that I didn't like, but most of them really rocked!!I exspecially liked WHITE LINES,PERFECT DAY, DRIVE BY, SUCCESS, CRYSTAL SHIP, THANK YOU, and I WANNA TAKE YOU HIGHER AGAIN!!Thsi is one of the best cover albums ever!!"
2,An Adventurous Mistake,"I agree with earlier reviewers who point out that this album pretty much ended the comeback story that was Duran Duran. It's worth getting just for the history lesson.There are a few gems here. Unlike many, I love ""White Lines"" and notice that every time they perform it live, it brings down the house. Simon le Bon gives ""Watching the Detectives"" a far more sinister and sexual feel than Elvis Costello ever did. And ""Success"" is a fun romp.But the rest is crap -- songs that either shouldn't be covered because the originals cannot be improved upon, or songs that *can* be covered, but *not* this way."
1,NO THANKS!,I think this is one of the worst CD's that I have ever heard. I like Duran Duran and I like all of the band that they cover. The problem is they are like oil and water. THEY DON'T MIX! Duran Duran singing Public Enemy? That really says it all.
4,"""PERFECT DAY"" IS EXTRAORDINARY!!","Let's get one thing straight...this cd is pretty weak!! There are only 4 decent covers here---- Thank You (ZEP), Lay Lady Lay (Dylan), Crystal Ship (Doors) & the absolutely beautiful ""Perfect Day""!! This song is darkly romantic! Duran does it to perfection! Even though Duran didn't write it, the song stands out as the BEST they've ever done! ""Perfect Day"" is the reason why this cd gets four stars...without it, it would only get 2! If you love beautiful, dark-romantic melody, then pick up this cd simply for the song ""Perfect Day""!"
3,it suffices,duran duran does a really decent job of that most sacred of songs...watching the detectives...and come on...the notion of simon lebon digging public enemy is rather delectable...
2,one star each for two songs,"Buy it from a used bin, for say, no more than 6 bucks, for two songs only. Lou Reed was quoted as saying that Duran's cover of ""Perfect Day"" was better then his original. Listen to Lou, and get this song. As only true Duran fans will buy this album, you'll be especially pleased with ""Drive By"". Gives me chills every time I listen. As for the rest of the album, well, I don't listen to it."
2,What were they thinking of?,"I'm one of the biggest Duranies around, but I have to say that the only thing this album does for me is make me laugh. This album was meant to be a tribute album to bands who have influenced Duran Duran over the years. Now, I can't think of *anyone* who has influenced Duran Duran *less* than Public Enemy - except for possibly Grandmaster Flash. And David Bowie and Roxy Music influenced them much more than, say, Elvis Costello, and yet where do they appear? Add to this hilarity Warren Cucurrullo's excruciating guitar - I can't stand it on ""White Lines"" - and you have something I really don't want to listen to again. Oh - except for the song ""Drive By"", which is the only thing on the whole album Duran wrote themselves, has no awful guitar in it and is a wonderful song. Next time, lads, stick to your own music."
4,Thank You Review,The choice of songs is the band's roots. It comes from everywhere. Some of it is Fine! Simon's voice is impressive.What overwhelmed me was the production! Amazing! This is unlike anything DD had done before. So that was the reason that they contined to use Anthony J. Resta as producer for the next several albums. An unknown shinng star! Lay Lady Lay is very nice-Simon is in great voice!
4,Covers well done!,"Most of the songs here are covers of fairly well-know pop, rock, rap songs -- yes, rap songs! I don't think that ""Drive By"" is a cover, more of an extension of ""The Chauffer"" from an earlier album. In some cases, I think these covers are better than the original for example the Elvis Costello song while it may have been better for Duran Duran to not try to redo Public Enemy's work."
3,Shoulda Saved It For the Live Shows,"A bizarre conglomeration of covers, some of which work, some of which don't even come close. ""Perfect Day"" is very well done, ""Drive By"" is an intriguing re-cut of ""Chauffeur"", and ""White Lines"" isn't as bad as one would expect (although it falls far short of the Grandmaster Flash version). Many of the other songs simply leave you scratching your head. If you're looking for some Duran Duran for your collection, you'd be better served to start somewhere else."
1,"Duran: When They're Good, They're Good. This Is Not One Of Those Times.","A horrid Duran Duran farrago! [They have a weakness for those, sadly]. Only their take of ""White Lines"" and maybe ""Thank You"" and ""Success"" is worth salvaging from the resulting embarrassment of an album! And ""Success"" is good only because of the Flo & Eddie backing vocals! This one stopped their impressive comeback in its tracks and for good reason! The only thing worse than their massacre of ""I Wanna Take You Higher"" is ""I Wanna Take You Higher [again],"" an even worse version included to placate departing bassist John Taylor. Well, it didn't work on either version and he bolted after this album. I would have too!"
2,a story for a jamaican group,"if you do not like cutting songs,this is not for you.This video is quite usefull for reggae novices who want to discover Israel vibration's living ina Babylon.All songs are cutting in half,so, great disappointment for reggae music lovers...."
1,don't buy this album!,"yes, bunny wailer has done was great albums (""blackheartman"", ""rootsman skanking""), however this marley tribute album is quite terrible. the tracks sound coputer generated, and they lack the feel of the great reggae. the keyboards filling in the spot of the horn sections, disgust me, do not buy this album. instead buy ealier recordings from bunny wailer."
1,Bunny phones it in for this one...,"I'm afraid it's true, this is not a good album. I bought it years ago when it was first released and was REALLY excited to have it. Then I listened to it and the elation ended. Bunny rushes through the songs and the production is terrible. Great concept, terrible execution. Bunny Wailer has released some fabulous albums (I just paid $75 for a copy of MARKETPLACE) but this is not one of them. To hear Bunny singing the Wailers, far better to get BUNNY WAILER SINGS THE WAILERS and TIME WILL TELL: A TRIBUTE TO BOB MARLEY. There is a MP3 only release called BUNNY SINGS THE WAILERS but I haven't checked that out and so can offer no opinion. But for this one...skip it."
1,Cash in?,Bunny Wailer and the producers of this album have managed to suck all the life out of almost every song here. Lifeless playing and singing all around. Just listen to the originals.
1,window visor,"Not a good product, i put it in and get worse wind sound and it also serve only accesorries..."
4,Restful,"Liked it a lot, but pull out the tape measure. 10 "" high is high.as long as you are comfortable with it, it is a great addition for your legs watching TV or reading a book. I would buy it again"
4,Project Management Education,"This is an excellent case study about Intel's P6 project -- that became the Pentium Pro and part of the lineage for a number of other processors. The author provides the story of compromises made while the project proceded and the corporate politics endured at Intel. He also discusses the Pentium flaw episode and provides a technical rationale that thay may have led to that unrelated debacle. It is fun to read about some of the technical aspects of this project. One flaw to the story is the lack of additional information on why Intel settled out of court and paid millions of dollars for alleged patent infringement accusations relating to the P6 project. The book is surprisingly upbeat considering the author no longer works at Intel. If you like this book, Brian Bagnall's ""On the Edge"" about the rise and fall of Commodore computer is an excellent follow-up."
2,thin,"I was looking forward to a history of the depth of, say ""Into the Black"" about JPL by Peter Westwick, a professional historian. The Pentium Chronicles is thin. I think it's trying mostly to be a project management book. The context is poorly drawn, the technical issues are nearly completely unexplained, and the stories are told without zest. The sidebars make the book feel like it is meant to be bought at an airport and discarded to the next passenger. Colwell is undoubtedly a fine computer architect but his writing leaves a lot to be desired, at least in this book."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product for my father who likes to wear old wool cardigan sweaters that are not machine washable. The only thing I liked about this product was the nice dark gray color. The cardigan is made from a cheap fleece that left fine lint all over my dad's shirt. It did not have a nice shape. My father is very slightly stooped shouldered and this accentuated the fact that the cardigan was short in the back. (I even tried the sweater on myself and the back was too short). The size XL had plenty of ""stomach room"" but the length of the sleeves and the overall sweater were for someone under 5 foot 9 inches. I would be afraid to wash and dry for fear the length would shrink more. I do not recommend this product, especially because of the lint. I am returning the product."
1,IEEE 1394 = Firewire :-(,"This product is meant for ipods that use firewire, not USB. I wish the title said Firewire rather than IEEE 1394."
1,wrong item,"I was unaware that the car charger was for an older version of iPods. I am sure this was my mistake, but it would be helpful if that information could be very obvious for non-techies like myself."
3,Lots of songs but sometimes lacking the 'swing',"She's a strong player but sometimes the 'swing' isn't quite right. Nevertheless, if you read music, this book will be a good tool."
5,Very Beautiful book,"Not for someone looking to learn stumpwork, but very inspirational. Many different flowers and litle scene's are described but without a background in stumpwork, it would be difficult.........But the projects in this book are fantastic. This book is worth having for the pictures alone."
1,Boycott this book,I was very disappointed with this book and author. It did not meet my expectations. Don't waste your money
2,It is bone not white,I purchased it because it said it was white. I was trying to hide the cord against white walls. It is bone colored.
3,Protected from a surge . . . sort of.,"I bought this a year ago. Just experienced our first power surge, and all the appliances plugged into the device are still in working order. Too bad the power strip no longer works! I am purchasing again just because I love the design so much."
4,"A quite adequate power strip, with one small issue.","If you plan on leaving this power strip on the floor, or unmounted, this should serve you fine. My only issue is when mounted, the two side mounted powerbrick/AC Adapter plugs become unaccessible because the grounding plug is towards the bottom of the powerstrip -- this makes it difficult or impossible to plug in three prong or polarized adapters as they are blocked by the wall."
5,These work!,This one is a replacement. The first one sacrificed itself & saved my TV. I now have one on all TV & computer outlets. These work!
4,Love it!,"We've had this diaper pail for 5.5 months now and we love it! It has always opened/closed just fine. This is our main diaper pail (I'm home with baby all day) and we still haven't had to replace the batteries. My only complaint is that it is a little bit small...we have to empty it twice a week. Then again, if it was bigger the bag of diapers would be very heavy. The filter is now wearing out, which causes the pail to stink, but I'm confident the smell will go away when we replace the filter (now if I could just find one...)"
1,sucks,The 1st one I bought only opened 1/2 the time. I returned it and got a replacement which never opened at all. A piece of SHT!!!
1,Does not work,This product does not work. We own an automatic-opening trash can that we use in our kitchen and that has worked fine for over a year. It's too bad that this company could not get a similar technology to work. I can't imagine that this product has not been recalled or discontinued yet.
3,A little stinky,"I purchased this diaper pail recently, I've used the Diaper Genie with my other 3 children, thinking the hands free option would be great. It is a great idea but they need to work on sealing the smell every time the lid opens. At first it was okay but after a while it got to be too much. I went out a few days ago and purchased the Diaper Genie II, I'm sure it will work just as well as the original. As a note, I've tried a few different brands and I've always come back to the Diaper Genie, it definitely is the best at keeping the odors locked in."
5,Super,Extra Super! Especially the insert with all the lyrics and photo of the Choir! My VERY FAVORITE Christmas CD :~)
2,Tiny locket with religious cross in center,"This locket, although beautiful is for a child. It is very small and dainty. You can't see it in the picture, but there is a cross from top to bottom and side to side. It is a shame that you can't see it and get a real idea of what you are buying. As I do not give religious gifts to anybody, and certainly would not wear one myself, I had to return the locket. If you know a child that you would like to give a gift for maybe a confirmation, or even a birthday, this is a beautiful locket."
1,Warning,"Warning!As at 12/17/2008 this listing is not for the Jim Capaldi album listed.Be aware the artist is listed as ""Sky high and the mau-mau"" and this is the name of the album you will receive."
2,This book will confuse you,"This book is good at introducing basic concepts, if this is whatyou want to know. But it is really bad to introduce algorithm.It simply confuse you. Many time I don't know what the authoris talking about and have to find the original paper, which ismuch clear."
2,Algorithms for Vlsi Physical Design Automation,"I read the Chapter on clock routing and found that theauthor did not do a good job on explaining about DMEalgorithm. I got more confused after reading it. So,I went to the library and checked the referenceswhich gave me clear understanding. Usually, a bookshoud give a reader with a very clear example aboutthe algorithm it presents. It's was not the case forthe DME algorithm."
3,"Worked good, but loud fan!","Great specs on the UPS. Worked pretty well too.... but.... it failed on me in little over 2 weeks. May have had a lemon, but went with a different vendor. Agree with other reviews, the fan is LOUD!!!!!"
1,Terrible read,"I am reading at least 1 book from each president and have read many in the American Presidents Series, but this has been by far the worst. The main objective from the author was to try to justify why this president should be ranked higher than he is. Most of the other Presidents Series books told the story about the man and different things that happened to them in a chronilogical order. This book jumps around and the author doesn't even go into his assasination. You would think or at least I would think that would be quite important and the reader would like to hear about what happened.I am going to continue with the next president in my own series of reading, but in time go find a better book about McKinley to read. I would encourage anyone to do the same."
3,Wiiliam McKinley,"Good book,but with a little too much detail. The thing I found so interesting about McKinley was that he was somewhat of a progressive.The book brought out many other aspects about him that one does not generally find in facts about the presidents."
3,OK -- Another Book is Better,"The author makes a good argument for the importance of McKinley, which is reasonable since many people do not know about McKinley. He was a staunch pro-business and pro-tariff northern Republican from Ohio, which was a very influential industrial state and produced several presidents. It also shows McKinley to be more judicious in his actions than some believe. He tried to serve the public good. The book does not use the space in the book to detail a good biography of McKinley or history of his very fascinating times. This book would make a decent second book about William McKinley and his times.If you want to learn more about William McKinley and the history of his times, I enthusiastically recommend the Pulitzer Prize-winningIn the Days of McKinley. I bought a copy used for under $10.William McKinley and His Americais also a fine choice."
3,An OK biography of our 25th President.,"I have liked Phillips writing in the past about our financial system. I think he has taken a little different approach on our 25th President. Basically, McKinley was a decent man who worked the system successfully as both Congressman, Governor, and President. He changed the focus of this country, from a fractured regional nation to a strong imperialist power. He held strong views but kept these masked. He was also a devoted husband, which appealed to the population. What I disliked about this approach to McKinley was the authors focus on him as a near great President and his reasonings at the expense of less biographic material on William McKinley.This is an OK read about our 25th President. He set TR up for a great Presidency before he was assassinated. His picks for the cabinet were exceptional. I would have liked to hear more about McKinley the man."
1,Very poor representative of the series,"I agree with other reviewers who found this book to be hard to follow. The reason for having a series editor is to ensure consistency across the volumes. Three others in the series were well written and insightful, so I was hoping for an enjoyable account of the life of this poorly known president - arguably the ""first modern president"". Unfortunately, I gave up half way through as I simply could no longer follow the narrative. I have full-length biographies of all the ""important"" presidents through Truman and have used this series to fill the gaps (W. H. Harrison, John Tyler, Benjamin Harrison) and all full-filled my expectations except for this one."
1,Worst in President Series,"I have read several of books within the President Series and this one is by far the worst. After reading the previous comments, it seems that this book is meant as a ""thesis."" Please don't publish a thesis in what is suppose to be a series of historical books.I was unable to follow the order of the author's thoughts, it was a spiral-processl; I was very dizzy after reading! Usually books have a somewhat linear approach to writing, instead this author chose to discuss one point, jump eight points then go back to the first.For people who want to read the President Series, and are excited about Presidential History, please do not be discouraged from reading the other books within the series - I recommed the one on Warren Harding. However, if you do choose to read this book on William McKinley, I highly recommend taking some Dramamine before you do."
2,Missing McKinley Bio,"This is the 24th Am President biography I have read so far and I found this one to be one of my least favorites. In a nutshell, this volume is more documentary and less bio. The chapters are full of good information but tends to be overly repetitive. Most disappointing for a biography is the fact that this president was ASSASSINATED!!! The author completely ignores this event. You would think one or two pages if not an entire chapter would be dedicated to this event. This was my first read about McKinley and while I am left feeling more impressed about the man and his time in office I would have liked to be better informed about the circumstances of his life, family and unfortunate death. Who shot the President and why?"
3,Not a straight biography,"I have read 5 or 6 volumes from the American Presidents series, and this one is entirely different in approach. It is not a straight chronologocal biography like the other volumes in the series, but a political analysis of McKinley and his administration."
1,William McKinley,a terrible biography. all we know is what the author thought he should have been given credit for. a huge disappointment.
2,"An argument, not a biography or history","Phillips is a political commentator, not a historian or biographer. His goal with this book isn't to sketch in McKinley's life but to argue a thesis. His thesis is that McKinley was a important president, and the thing that makes him important is that he illustrates Phillips' career-making mega-theory about realignment politics. It's a campaign strategist's view of history.Phillips doesn't seem to have consulted any primary sources at all. We get a lot of ""he must have reflected"" stuff, and assertions that McKinley deliberately wore a mask of conventionality, and that his blandness was a conscious strategy, etc., with no attempt to demonstrate the historical validity of any of it.Still, there is some good stuff about Ohio's political centrality in the post-Civil War era, and a very good summary of the gold-silver debate, which was a matter of passionate interest in the 1880s and 1890s but is so baffling to modern Americans."
2,"Too much politics, too little McKinley","I have read 18 of the books in this series, and this one is by far the least satisfying. Most of the other volumes maintain a balance between the personal life of the president, and his administration and policies. Phillips leans so heavily in the latter direction that I hardly felt I knew anything about the man himself. And can you imagine a book about an assassinated president that contains NO ACCOUNT of the actual crime, and not even a mention of the assassin? Phillips was too busy trying to raise McKinley's sagging reputation (especially in relation to his successor, TR) to give us more details about his life, family, and untimely death. I learned a lot about tariffs, the gold standard, and our relationship with Britain, but not much about McKinley."
3,THREE and a HALF STARS,"Liked the first book ""NOTHING..."" better.. the secound just copied alot of the same chapters in the first word for word.. BUT BOTH ahd ALOT of info.. now im just looking for a way to contact bob my email.. have questions on if dreaming is really your soul visiting the 4th dimension and about Spontaneuos Combustion.. anybody have an email address to B.Frissell email me at cheemama@latinmail.com"
3,Disapointing,"The author means well, but this book doesn't measure up to the first one. The first half of the book is informative, but the second half of the book reads like a plug for rebirthing and gets too auto-biographical and boring. I think this book will hurt Mr. Frisell's credibility and that's a shame because he really does have a lot to offer."
3,Linking it Together,"Bob Frissell's book was one of several I used as reference for an article I was writing about a shift in global consciousness. Of particular value to me was his comment on the accelerated evolution of human consciousness: ""What this means in part is that we are already in a different reality. Eventss that would normally happen may not happern that way at all. It means that our thoughts, feelings, and actions are more powerful than ever, and we have the ability to instantly alter our reality. This is why the success rate of many predictions (Cayce, Nostradamus etc.) has fallen off dramatically since 1972.""This is a fun book to read along with his more recent one,""You Are a Spiritual Being Having a Human Experience."""
2,"Brilliant in spots, but on the whole, forgettable","An interesting if not great book, The Steampunk Trilogy relates three unconnected tales about a quirky, early Victorian world where genetically engineered salamanders reign and where nuclear train engines and ""ideoplasm""-powered transdimensional prairie schooners haunt the imagination. DeFilippo's success here is in the details---the fustian prose echoes that of the 19th century, as does the fiery libertine poetry, while the characters never quite lose a certain postmodern knowingness, a glint in the eye as it were.Alas, he never seems to weave these details into a memorable story. Two days after completing it, and ""Hottentots"" (the second of the three stories comprising the trilogy) is receding in my memory. The other two stories, ""Victoria"" and ""Walt and Emily,"" were more compelling, but only marginally so.Good for checking out of the library or buying from a used-book store."
2,Juvenille Junk,"Picked this up based on a ""Oh, you like China Mieville, you'll like this"" recommendation. Big mistake. The prose is bland, the characters are universally one-dimensional, the plot ""twists"" are stunningly obvious throughout, and the whole thing feels like the quality of writing you expect to pick up at a 4th grade bookmobile stop. I read through the first story, ""Victoria"" with rapidly dwindling interest. Only because I felt it unfair to judge the book on less than half of the read did I bother reading through the second story, ""Hottentots"" which is no better (and in many ways worse) than the first.Steer clear of this one. I'm sure you could find worse things to read, but it'd take effort."

2,Waste of money!,Only 4 designs and three of them are awful! This is a leaflet not a book! The jolly santa stocking is not at all jolly and his mouth is gross and he is scowling! One just has a small penguin design on it and another has typical holly leaves spaced over it with a name. The only one that is passable is the Joan Elliot bear on the front cover. The four designs over the title are all you get. Rip-off!
1,Don't waste your money on this book ! ! ! ! !,The cover is VERY misleading as it is the ONLY pattern that is really worth anything. Another is a penguin and a third is holly which just repeats over and over. Basically these are 2 quick ornament designs. The fourth is an odd looking Santa. Definitely NOT worth $8. Don't waste your money on this book ! ! ! ! !
2,Not as cute wen you get it to your house,The patterns are not very involved and the focal pattern is really not that cute when you look at it close up. BUT the supplier got the product here VERY quickly. Shockingly quick.
2,Entertaining but not entirely true documentary of the greatest,"The 2 stars I gave this are solely for the few in it who told the complete truth and for the music and photos presented. My dear friend was interviewed about his experiences with Hank but they cut a lot of that out and decided to focus on the ridiculous ""Truths"" that folks like Colin Escott give.Colin: You're a liar!Hank and Audrey are not here to defend themselves so don't dare try to ruin their names."
2,"Zero complete song performances, though they obviously have the footage.","This may be a good documentary, but if you're looking for footage of Hank singing, this dvd will probably only irritate you. Makes me darn near sociopathic. Even when they have video footage of a performance, they can't resist overdubbing everyone's opinions of his life. Idiots. Almost as bad is when they have the audio and video, and they don't bother to sync them even closely. I just want to see and hear Hank sing. This was frustrating."
4,Great for my classes,"I bought this DVD to show to my Popular Music segment of Music Appreciation for High School Students. It is a very informative and accurate collection of interviews, concert clips, rememberences and discussions of those closest to Hank.I wouls recommend it to other teachers, as well as those who are or aren't fans of Hank. You will gain a totally new perspective of his music, and life. I was not a fan, but now have a great appreciation of what Hank did for Country and Pop music at the time. No matter what popular music you listen to now, (country, pop, rock, hip hop, blues, gospel, etc.) Hank Williams had a hand in it and did it all himself. (Yes, even Rap....check out Hank the Drifter!)"
2,Not enough Hank,I was disappointed in this video by the constant narration...even interrupting Hank's simging..with morbid comments...
5,Very good document.,I recomended for all who have not (until this time) right this DVD and love music and it's history: Go and buy it!
3,Basic Overview,For those with little understanding of the housing market this would be a good primer. For those looking for more analysis of real estate and its impact on the economy you would be better served to look elsewhere.
5,Perfect for C250,"I use the C250 for backup tracks while playing lead guitar so the unit is away from the computerand the USB charge for most of the time, so needed a way to keep the battery charged and thisworks fine and adds another wall wart to my growing pile."
4,Good,"I had trouble using the computer charger for the Sansa, but this charger has been great. The one I received is actually white in color."
4,Sansa e250,The unit performed as advertised. Was extremely easy to learn to use (I'm 63 years old...). Down/up loads were a snap. Sound with the included earbuds was quite nice. My wife (electronically challenged) has one too...she loves it when we fly.
1,Awful,It broke within a week. One of the prongs for plugging it in fell of in the socket and i couldn't get it out so i had to throw the awful little charger away along with the surge protector it was plugged into. It is a fire and electric shock hazard and should never have been sold to anyone for any reason ever.
4,Ordered 2 and got 2 different products,"I ordered two of these within one day of each other and when I got them both on the same day I was surprised to find I got two different chargers. As it turns out one came from Eforcity and one from ClearAV.The Eforcity one is a little bigger but has a bigger ""light"". The plug does not fold down like on the ClearAV one. That one says ""inspire"", is smaller, and has a small light. I wish I could report on the quality but these are gifts so I won't know."
3,MP3 charger,First one I received it did not work. Second time it did.I really wanted it for a trip when I got back I had the charger.
4,Fragile but works,"It's cheap, fragile, but does work. The prongs are tight and do require force to plug in. There is a clear window on top which has a green LED to show it is working. I accidentally pressed on the window when plugging it in and pushed it down into the circuit board and cracked the case. It still works but be careful as you can crush this quite easily."
5,Great handy & portable accessory for your Sandisk Sansa,"There are time when you need to recharge your Sandisk Sansa when on the go. And if you're on the go, you dont always bring your laptop with you. This is where this nifty little charger come in. It is multi-voltage, you can recharge you're Sansa anywhere in the world that runs on AC current. It has a red light indicator to let you know you are charging. It doesnt however let you know if you're Sansa is already fully charged, you have to physically look at your Sansa to find out. I can live with that. Great little accessory for those moments when you are away from your laptop and you need a quick charge for you Sansa."
5,Travel Charger for Sandisk,I've been looking for a ac/dc charger for my sandisk and found it at a great price here.
4,Works Great,"Received the charger in a timely manner. Had no trouble with it, it works great. I liked the price too."
5,charger- good item,This wall travel charger works well with my Sansa e250. I bought this to replace my lost USB charger that came with the Sansa player. The wall charger works well and I use it more that the replacement USB cable that I bought to charge the mp3 player. I like the wall charger because I don't have to have my computer on to charge it.
2,Wall Charger not all it seemed....,"I bought this charger after my usb one was run over by my car. Purchased a usb/adapter/charger and the wall charger since the prices were so reasonable. Used the charger 3-4 times, has a pretty green light that lights up to let you know the sansa is charging. Worked as expected. Used it friday and when I removed it from the wall at work one of the prongs broke off in the wall socket! I haven't been hard or rough on the charger only used it a few times and it was very disappointing it broke so quickly...good luck with yours. They are so cheap I suggest you purchase two of them."
1,Failed on First Use - Prong detached from unit and remained stuck in wall outlet,"This product appears to be both a fire and electrocution/safety hazard. On first use one of the prongs detached from the AC adapter and remained firmly affixed inside the wall socket when user attempted to unplug unit from wall. User then had to flip the circuit-breaker to that outlet and remove the stuck prong using pliers. The seller, United Integral of San Gabriel, CA is selling what appears potentially to be a very dangerous product."
3,Does the trick,How could you argue for the price? It's certainly not sexy or slick but it does the trick. Haven't had a problem with it yet.
4,Good deal for both,"I bought these as a suggested add-on when I purchased my fiance's Sansa Fuze mp3 player. At the time, I didn't realize that it charged itself anytime it was plugged into a computer's USB port, but it turns out that I would have wanted this anyway. I use a laptop, which means that the computer would have turned itself off while the player was charging, and it charges more quickly when plugged into the wall anyway. It was a good price to get the wall charger and the car charger."
4,Couldn't beat the value,"The only thing that doesn't thrill me is that the light on it stays lit even though charging is done. However, I've never had a problem with it so far."
1,not happy at all.,"I am really disappointed with this product. The 1st time my sone plugged in hsi SanDisk Fuze, the female part of the plug melted. Luckily we were able to disengage it from the Fuze once it cooled. The 2nd charger I purchased after 2 uses 1 of the male prongs fell out. So, I will be going to another retailer to purchase another charger and hope it works."
1,Alway Brakes,"I have purchase this product twice and every time it works just fine for a few days, but after a week or so it always brakes. I purchase it because I travel a lot and by the end of my trip I have to throw it away because it fell apart. So, this is good product if you don't travel with it."
5,"Convienient, lightweight Charger",This inexpensive charger is an asset to my mp3 player. It charges quickly and lets me charge the player without having to plug into a usb port.
1,Did not work,"When I plugged it into my sansa e260, the battery meter jumped to 100% but upon removal it quickly dropped back down to the original level. Did not charge my player at all even after leaving it plugged in all day."
3,If I ever used it...,"It's probably a great charger, since my experiences with Sansa have been good. However, it wouldn't work with my little 'SansaClip' which will charge off the computer, so I returned it. I haven't heard a word from THAT company yet, though."
1,WARNING - adapter fries the fuze!,"We purchased this product to charge the sansa fuze. The first time we plugged it in, nothing at all happened. No lights to indicate that the unit was charging. It turned out, the Fuze was dead. We assumed we had purchased a faulty Fuze, so went out and bought another. This time, we charged it using the USB adapter that came with it, and it charged fine. When it was time to recharge, we used the wall charger not realizing that it had been the cause of the problem with the first unit. The Fuze immediately went dead. This can't possibly be a coincidence. Do not use this product with your Fuze."
3,Looks good.,Got it fast. it looks good. haven't used it yet. been using computer to charge. but it looks good.
5,Great little surge protector,"This is a great little surge protector that does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have gone through my fair share of surge protectors, and the tripp-lite one so far has been the best. The price was very reasonable and the shipping was really fast."
5,If you like top quality,"You can spend less and get less at the local hardware storeThe build quality is outstandingThe unit looks, feels and functions beautifullyExcellent specs and credentialsI bought three and am ordering several more, the feeling of security on my expensive electronics is extremely satisfying"
4,It is a good buy,"I bought this product a month ago. It works beautifully, lots of plugs and it has a protection for the expensive equitments I have in my living room. Consider the price I paid, it surely is a good buy."
5,Highly recommend,Great product and fast service!!! I have several of these protectors in our house and so far have not had any issues!!
5,Tripp Lite TLP808 Surge Protector,"Easy access to plug my iPad, phone, and camera charger while I sleep in my room or in the hotel. I bring this surge protector with me when I travel so I can plug this surge protector to a single outlet."
5,good product,quality product and works well. It is getting hard to find this item around where I live so I took a chance and bought this on. It turned out it was a good choice.
5,Can not be ignored,"Write a heterodoxical book and watch the numbnuts lie and squerm. Some people who suggest that they know better, have found it impossible to attack the findings so they attack the author as a 'fool'. But Sach didn't do the stats himself - they were carried out by a group of highly professional statistitions from the Ludwig-Maximilian Univeristy of Munich and theAllensbach Institure for Demgraphic Research.I have no interest in astrology but there is now far too scientific evidence to believe the blockers who do not want to find evidence for what they do not like. Sach's work is good, building on solid material from people like Michel Gauquelin in France and Percy Seymour in England.Don't be fooled by the blusterers - there is something in astrology and the physics is slowly being unravelled."
4,A truly beautiful novel,"This books was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner award in 1991 and as I read it I was amazed I had never heard of it before. It tells the story of Grace Brush, a girl trying to stay sane in a world of migraines, halucinations, and famliy secrets. The language is lush and carefully conceived, inviting the reader into the mind of a young child as recalled by a smart and generous adult. This is not easy going - the story is heart-breaking - but it is well worth the time."
2,The Alamanc Branch,I had a hard time with this one. It seemed pointless and to ramble. Loved his other books but this one was flat.
5,Ralph Myerz & The Jack Herren Band - A Special Album,"Ralph Myerz & The Jack Herren Band give us a hidden gem of a downtempo album. A SPECIAL ALBUM carries on the Scandanavian tradition of crackling good music, from the ghostly Slavic voice on ""Nikita"" to the sad and plaintative ""You Never Come Closer."" ""Think Twice"" throws in some mellow funk. Some well-placed dub influences appear as well, from the quiet echoes to accompany the whistling on ""A Special Morning"" to the full-on reggae rhythms of ""Savannah."" ""Funky Bizness"" has a disco polish to it, while ""Lullaby"" finishes out the album with a cool moodiness underlaid with a toe-tapping beat before giving way to some long string pulls and a horn chorus. Special, indeed!"
4,A Special Album,"A Special Album is quite easily a staple album for anyones music library. The surreal tones and complex layers in the bands sound shift and sway with such ease that one may find themself dreaming with the music. ""Think Twice"" is easily the highlight of the album, building both the complex musical nature of the group while still maintaining good structure. The light dance tempos and relaxing overtones make it a very colorful track. The other two major ear-candy are ""Casino,"" which is an organ infused retro ride into smooth jazz electronica vegas, and ""A Special Morning;"" a sensual yet sleepy walk of nostalgia. This album is a great addition to any collection, and this a group to keep a close eye on for future production and collaboration."
3,Elevator music for really cool people.,"Despite all of the funny sounding tags used by reviewers to describe the music contained on this album what it, and much of the stuff that these peeps are trying to describe, is really just elevator music albeit directed at the coolest amongst us. You won't soon weary of listening to this album because, quite frankly, you prolly won't listen to it; just put it on in the background and go on about your business whether it be working on your next conquest or simply playing around on the amazon website. The tunes on this album are good, clean harmless time-killing fun that I analogize to a new brand of lemongrass flavor novelty soft drink that I drank yesterday. I got a kick out of tasting it, of course, but at the end of the day it were really just flavored fizzy water."
3,Nonchallenging but enjoyable techno pop from Norway,"This was the classic example of an impulse buy for me: it was playing in the store at the time, and I thought it was pretty groovy. Can't say I'll be listening to this one in a year or so, but there are a few solid pop tunes on here: #2, #3, and #4 come to mind. However, there are some clunky throwaways also, like #7 and #8. Not terribly challenging, but some nice songs to add to a cd mix."
3,baby's first bible songs,would like to be able to here some of the song on the tape before you buy it .
4,Hot Rod Surf,"I really liked this dvd and learned a lot from it. To me it is a perfect beginners introduction because it goes in a very logical order. It briefly covers the minimum equipment needed to start out and get your feet wet and start striping. Next it covers the basic shapes that need to be practiced. These shapes are a handful of simple patterns that can be put together to create your own style. Mind you these are not advanced techniques, but simple shapes all with the beginner in mind. But with these simple shapes, incredible striping can be done. That is what the rest of the video is about. Showing how Hot Rod Surf uses these to create some awesome striping on a variety of cars, motorcycles, and more."
1,Horrible video,"This product was absolutely horrible. My husband has gotten into pinstriping and so I got him this video to help him lay down better lines. This video was made by an amateur who doesn't even know how to pinstripe. When me and my husband sat down to watch it we actually just ended up laughing the whole time because we couldn't believe that this guy was serious. The guy in the video needs some lessons in pinstriping. He had a shaky hand, did not lay down straight lines, and his lines never connected (a no-no in pinstriping.)Also his designs were never symmetrical. A five year old could have done what he did. I have never seen anyone use as many dots in their pinstriping as he does. We know a few good pinstripers like Von Hot Rod who would be a much better candidate to learn from. My honest opinion do not buy this video it is a waste of money and won't teach you the correct way to pinstripe."
3,WRONG BOOK,I just ordered this book and it is NOT FOR PIANO!!! It is the guitar tab book. Despite what the Image shows and the description says it is NOT FOR PIANO!!
5,No Regrets,A lot easier than going and finding it in the store and in the same great condition. I was very pleased and completely satisfied with my order. Amazon ftw!
2,Not what I expected,"It's horrible because there's no guitar tablature. What a disappointment. If you play piano, you're in luck. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
4,Very fun and catchy (mostly),"I personally love this album. However, for the sake of other consumers, I must say that it isn't flawless. Some of the songs are awesome (""Safety Dance"" and ""Moonbeam"") while others can be pretty annoying (""Hey Men"" and ""Where do the Boys Go?""). You generally can't find many albums which have a perfect set of songs, so don't be discouraged to buy this album. I love Men Without Hats, but I still don't like those two songs which I mentioned above. If you like this type of music (New Wave, Dance), then I highly recommend this to you. Just keep in mind that you may be skipping over a couple tracks."
2,When bad music happens to good decades...........,"For those of you recently converted 80's music fans looking for some tunes, undoubtedley this collection might be calling your name. Having found this album in a rental car I decided to give it a spin and let me say that for the most part it gives 80's music a bad name. Synthesisers, cheesy vocals and vocal ballads are expected from good 80's music but for the most part this album misses the mark. The Safety Dance is stil a fun song that will bring a smile to your face but the rest of the songs just don't cut it. They aren't catchy, they aren't fun and they aren't worth getting.Bottom Line: If you want The Safety Dance im sure it can be on numerous 80's compliations that are much better than this."
5,One Word ..,"MIDGET. I really don't like Men without Hats. ..why didn't they have any hats? hmmm. Well anyway I give this 5 stars because in their video they had a midget running all around wearing silly clothes and stuff. And the song itself is pretty bizarre. I'm not sure why I enjoy it so much but I do.You think singing this song to midgets in real life would be a bad idea?I hope one day, for their most excellent contribution to music history, they are awarded hats."
2,MEN WITHOUT HITS,"I loved ""The Safety Dance"" and ""Pop Goes the World"" back in the eighties! but that's all. Every other song is utterly forgettable. SORRY."
2,Men Without Jobs,"Why does Matt Groening (creator of the Simpsons and Futurama) keep putting The Saftey Dance in his shows. Men Without Hats were the Canadian version of really bad Devo (see the Devo albums after Oh No it Devo and you'll understand). The eighties were not all that good, and that's why that 80's show tanked horribly. If you want something similar (along the lines of Casio) go find Squab Teen, or Plone."
2,MEN WITHOUT HATS - MEN WITHOUT TALENT,"Another band riding the New Wave, with one or two hits, then faded into the limelight. If you do like them,then look for the import , it would be the better choice then the US version.However if you just want ""Safety Dance"" go for a compilation.However, they do have a following, so they must have something! Stick with Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Duran Duran, or Reflex.If a DJ, a good album to have because of the extended version of the main song SAFETY DANCE, which is very popular with the +30 crowd."
5,Soul of a Citizen is a great book,"My husband and I have always wanted to help improve the world, especially on enviromental and sustainability issues. In the past we have felt overwhelmed to do anything. All issues appeared to big, the gov't too far away and unreachable.Then we both read the book ""Soul of a Citizen"" by Paul Roget Loeb, we now know that our efforts do add up and make a difference. We are currently working on a letter writing campaign to get the Children's Enviromental Protection Act passed.This is an excellent book. Read it today and start changing the world!"
5,A handbook for our time,"This book is a keeper. It's a good, inspiring read, plus it's good to simply have around, reminding you of its contents. It struck me as a political version of Julia Cameron's ""The Artist's Way."" While she explains that ""born"" artists are a myth, Loeb describes community activists who aren't saints or crazies. Both writers try to motivate flawed, busy people to forget about perfection and take the plunge-whether it be into playful creativity or a social cause-in order to feel more whole and alive. I recommend this personal guidebook to everyone, to every age and class, from the left to the right."
2,A non-academic book for the baby boomer generation,"As many other reviewers I was asked to read this book as a part of a college course. My wife was recently assigned the reading in her MSW program. I do believe it has some value, but to a specific generation and type of activist. The book rarely (if at all) discusses a model of activism outside of that born from the peace and love movement of the 60-70s. If you are from these eras, by all means this is the book for you. If you are or will soon be a college student you will likely find little to connect with in the book. I suspect that its over use in courses at this time is a result of faculty promoting a book they feel applies to them greatly without thinking of how it applies to younger generations."
2,duh!,"I read this book for a college class on Social Work, and although Loeb tells many meaningful and powerful stories, this is the same text I have heard before. If you read the first and last paragraph of each chapter you basically get the point. It's an easy read, and some may find it powerful, but I just found it repetitive and over-told."
2,Some Good Stuff - But a Bit Highhanded and Critical!,"The stories of the actual activists are excellent and the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable book. Much of the time Mr. Loeb criticizes others for their point of view and offers little in the way of constructive alternatives. Mr. Loeb was a guest at our University recently and his verbal rehashing of the book material did little to change my mind. This is not to say the book has no merit, just that his approach left much to be desired and in no ways aids the burgeoning activist remain committed - as is implied in the title. Oh well."
2,"Great topic but more of the same,tired rhetoric","Started the book with great promise. It is certainly a timely topic. And I agree with his premise that everything is impossible until someone takes the time to confront the issue. However, it becomes mired down with stereotypical examples of community activism. Thank God small groups of students from Ivy League schools exist to eliminate all the worlds ills. Generally, college student groups are not what I consider sources of great intellect and fact. There is an agenda. Hence the group. In my fifties, I appreciate their energy but question the content. Loeb gives great credit to these groups from the abolishment of Apartheid to the cure for the common cold (okay, my words, not his). And in writing this, I fall into his definition of cynic and can therefore be dismissed.Some of his examples were well thought out, but so many more were just too formula for me. I finished about half the book, and will go on to something else."
1,Little More Than Stories,"While Loeb's work certainly demonstrates his dedication to service it lacks critical examination. Loeb repeatedly cites examples of amazing service and highlights compassionate people but fails to push his readers to think about the theoretical pieces behind the actions. Without critical analysis there is no reason to take this work serious. Additionally, Loeb entirely ignores working class people and the roles that they can play in service. The work is naive and generally fluff."
1,Unenlightening and cynical.,"I wanted to write and share with you how thoroughly disappointed I was with this book.This book is so narrow and politically motivated that I found it offensive. The liberal slant is horrible. He makes uniformed, liberally biased references to many national issues that make it very difficult to take him serious.To his credit, he does make some good points - but, honestly, none of them are poignant. He draws on ideas and information that others have already printed and makes few citations.He was unenlightening and cynical and his book is poorly done."
1,Too Immersed in His Own Political Opinions,"While Paul Loeb's message about serving others has some merit and valid points, it is hard to distinguish them from his own political opinions. Readers that do not identify themselves as a hard-core Democrat will have a hard time identifying with his point of view. He seems to spend more time complaining about the work of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon than he does offering solutions to making this world a better place. So, unless you are a liberal, stay away!"
5,inspiriation in a cynical world,This book is a must read! Anyone who cares in this time of apathy will be inspired and keep hope for a better world!
5,Inspirational,"I am in the first week of my class and we were assigned our first reading assignment from this book. As soon as I opened it, I could not put it down. This book makes a believer of everyone. Social changes involves everyone; therefore, for those who think that they can't do a single thing, then this book is a must for them. This is the remedy that we all need to make a change in our environment."
3,Review,"The book has interesting ideas, and has been nicely revised to include examples from the past few years. However, it gets rather repetitive and I didn't feel like I was getting any new ideas after the first few chapters."
4,waterproof watch great for Moms,"I have this watch as a gift to my daughter for her birthday. She has a two-year old son and is constantly swimming, bathing, cleaning and doing many other activities that involve water. She loves being able to manage her toddler's activities without worrying about securing her watch and always being able to watch the time to get home in time for Daddy. The watch is attractive and doesn't look like a sports watch, so she can wear it anywhere, but the fastening system doesn't allow for optimal fitting for her (my only concern about an otherwise outstanding product)"
4,Conenant and Mikvehs,I love this book. I purchased it for a totally different reason as the title gave me the impression it was a study on the Nephilim returning to earth once more. So I'd say it was completely mistitled. Thomas Horn has excellent books on the study of Nephilim and fallen angels if anyone is trying to do a study on that subjectNephilim Stargates: The Year 2012 and the Return of the Watchers. This really was a happy mistake as I learned so much more deeply about God's holy covenants with us and how I can deepen my relationship with God and go far beyond the salvation and servant position. I love how they take you step by step and really outline Hebrew roots of our faith to give a more colorful picture of God's desire towards us and how we can respond.
2,Devils and Demons and the return of the Nephilim,"Very disapointing! Too much off topic information. It has only some information on devils, demons and the nephilim, and nothing at all on the return of the nephilim. Strange when you consider the title. I do not feel good about this purchase or the misleading reviews.PS. I don't know why ""Son of Bigfoot"" shows up on my reviewer name."
5,The best book I have read to better understand the bible...,"I was surprised when I starting reading this...its not all about demons but a historical look of the language of Jesus and what were the thoughts and ideas of the people in the Old Testament days..ie.what is a threshold covenant, blood and salt covenant, why they thought and did things that don't make sense now. but after reading this book, all the puzzle pieces come together.One of the best books I have read to better understand the bible and the people in the bible. These author's other books are really good too. You must get this...you won't be disappointed."
4,Where's the Second Book?,"Definitely the wrong title for the book, however, once I got into it the background information was insightful. A long time Christian, most of the information in this book, I had never heard before. I would recommend this book to any ""new"" believer, to give you the grasp of what God's covenants with us really mean.Does anyone know if the ""second book"" has been published?"
3,Disappointed,"I have Spears and Klein's Lost in Translation series volumes 1 and 2. I bought this book thinking that it would give more in depth information on devils and demons and nephilim, but all it is is an earlier version of volume one. The only difference I saw was that volume one has an Appendix that offers a comparison of the book of Enoch and the New Testament, and the different title and cover, of course. If you are considering purchasing it, don't. Buy volume one instead. They don't even sell this one on their own website."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I read this book and was impressed with its remarkable insights into ancient Hebrew perspective, culture and biblical exegesis. The authors' focus is not only about devils and demons; they also cover topics from the Bible's Hebrew origins, to the understanding of covenant, the Jewish Feasts, as well as a refreshing look on ancient mythology. What's more, they profide great historical and scriptural evidence to support their views. I was appalled by Miss Edith Bottom's review. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but she obviously never read the book! I would highly recommend this book to all my friends! Buy it!!"
3,"Interesting read, but............","This book, while an interesting read, is more of a discourse on the origins of scripture and the interpretation of the Hebrew language than a detailed expose' of the Nephilim. If you are looking for a book that deals specifically with the Nephilim then I would recommend you look elsewhere. I think the title was more of marketing ploy vice an indicator of the main topic of the book."
2,Not What I Was Expecting...,"This book, while it does contain some insightful information, is not the best ever written. Within the first thirty pages, the authors contradict themselves two different times when discussing languages. Their choice of dialogue lead me to believe this book is geared for a specific audience: Children. Their language and audience perception is geared very low, and has remnants of a middle school text book. Throughout the book, they lean more towards a conservative Christian perception of the subject with each page.I was hoping for an unbiased overview, not someone's opinion on how God sees Nephilim, or a lesson in languages and comparisons. I guess I'll have to keep looking."
4,"Good book, but I cut off the demon pictures (like atrracts like?)","I am giving this book 4 stars, not 5, because though I think it is excellent in it's research and clarity of thought, really it is not just about the nephilim - as one would think from reading over the descriptive info on it. The parts that are not about the nephilim were quite interesting, though.Hopefully, for the upcoming sequel, the authors will not add another one of those hideous pictures. Some say demons are attracted to things that are related to them, or that picture them. Don't know if that's true in the case of the picture on the front and back covers of Devils and Demons - but I took no chances and got out the scissors. Didn't want to look at the horrid thing anyway. I'd really prefer not to have mangled book covers though! :-("
3,Challenge of Change,Was a bit disappointed in the product. It was filmed live when doing a seminar for a product. His comments were directed to the company. I would of liked it to be not so long (15-20). Too pricey for what I got.
5,A Must Buy,"I am generally not a fan of women comics, but this was one of the funniest comedians that I have ever seen."
5,"Lisa Lampanelli ""Take It Like a Man""","Hi Everyone! Lisa is great on so many roasts, Did anyone check her out on the Pam Anderson roast? My husband and I about fell off the sofa dying in laughter. I researched alot of her stuff and this one got very high marks.! They are gifts under the tree for my husband, son, and looking for one for my son-in law this Xmas.! Get it and laugh till tears run down your face! B. j."
1,not very impressed,"it wasn't very funny, it was more shocking... she insults a lot of different groups... its more of a loud mouth type comedy... i laughed a few times but it was more of a "" i can't believe she just said that"" or "" i bet she is gonna get beat up"" kind of laugh"
3,about 10% jokes and 90% insults,"I had high hopes for this DVD after seeing Lisa on the Comedy Central Roasts, but this wasn't as funny or clever as I thought it would be. The DVD is 60 minutes with no bonus features, and her material was literally like 5 minutes of jokes buried under 55 min of insults, often-repeated and vulgar. Not that I mind dirty language, I just like there to be SOME substance behind all the foul talk. If you've seen her Comedy Central roasts, you've pretty much gotten the essence of this DVD - only buy it if you're a BIG fan of hers and aren't expecting a lot of clever writing or huge pile of actual JOKES jokes."
5,She is our generations Don Rickles. . .,"I bought this dvd as a gift for my best friend. We laughed so hard. Everyone was fair game in her humor. The greatest thing was that nobody in the audience was offended, just the opposite everyone was laughing so hard. I'm not sure this is for kids however since we don't have any it was fun to watch."
1,Returned,That was not the item that I wanted and so I posted it back as advised but have not got the response yet.
5,Blue Juice is magic,"This stuff is great - french horn rotary and trumpet valves are now smooth after just one good application! Whatever this is I think it is better than the normal stuff I've been using.The bad news is that the packaging from this seller left a lot to be desired. It arrived in a slightly padded envelope and the bottom of the bottle had a crack in it, so the envelope was soaked. Unhappy mailman handed it to me. Not enough had leaked to send it back (still had about 5 oz, and that will last me a year plus), but a bit more padding in the packaging would be a good idea."
4,Close to perfect,"This game rocks, it was the only kicken WWII RST until Comapany of Heroes came out."
4,Excellent WW2 themed title,"Codename Panzers is brought to you by the same people that made the rock solid Blitzkrieg. Funny thing is I thought they may have made the game stale by staying in the same genre, I couldnt have been more wrong. Panzers is just balls out fun and one of the better RTS games Ive had the pleasure to own in the last year. Tactics rule the battlefield as it should be, you will feel the tension of urban environments as ambushes can and will pop up at anytime. Attempt to rush at your own peril especially if the enemy holds a key chokepoint. AI is excellent and the graphics are awesome combined with engrossing gameplay Panzers is well worth the purchase."
4,Good solid RTS gameplay,"Panzers, contrary to some opinions here, is not a bad game. It's definitely one of the better, more detailed, WWII RTS. I've played all the demos so far, and even got some time with a friend's German copy.It's got some solid gameplay. I couldn't find any bugs, and the units are nicely balanced. And unlike most other RTS of late, there are no pathing issues! It's nice to issue a movement command and watch the infantry and tanks actually follow a sensible route from point A to point B. The lack of good pathing drove me crazy in Heroes of WWII.Graphically, it's pretty tasty. Even zoommed in tight, unit markings are clear and true-to-life.I'd say go for this over Heroes of WWII. It won't tax your PC nearly as much, yet it looks just as good. And the gameplay is more fun, a lot less micromanagement."
2,Unimpressed,"After playing Blitzkrieg{Which I love}, I'm not overly impressed with the game. The AI doesn't seem to realistic. I sat and hammered on a russian armored car with a Tiger tank and it took about 6 or 7 shots to kill it! This is not how it worked out in real life, a Tiger would kill a T-34 in one shot let alone an armor car. It seemed to be the case throughout the playing experience. Blitzkrieg was a much better game for shot to kill or game realism. Also bought version 2 and it is worse. The graphics are great and the cut scenes are ok but if you want realism I would think twice!"
1,Does not load,This is not for windows xp. Will not even load to registration point. Would return but?? Looks like the program is Hungarian.Guess I lost that $9.
5,I read all reviews before puchasing,"This game is the BEST ground based WW2 game on the market hands down. The details in the vehicles is stunning and accurate. The germans speak german, russian speak russian, etc. The missions are enjoyable with some very tough ones. The cut scenes are wonderfully done bringing in the characters the game portrays. Check out the longer reviews and in more depth as they are right on the money and its money well spent on this game."
1,To less for todays standard in RTS,"Hello,i played at least the AO'Games, WC3 and Comand & Conquer Generals + ZH and must really say that the SinglePlayer Modus is ""ok"" in relation to this other RTS games but also a fact is, when you like to play Multiplayer (i think most of us would do that) with this game i couldn't suggest this game. Until there wouldn't be several patches for the multiplayer modus (so sty tunend). The main problem is that everybody could change the prices for his vehicles and soldiers =/. With this problem I only could warn you to buy it and i will rever to other games (ground control 2 for e.g.).yourscb"
2,It's sucks,"Totally agree with mark. After games like Soldiers: Herous of WWII, Blietzkrig - this game is totally unrealistic. Just another arcade. Forgive me for my bad english."
1,A lot of bugs,"I bought the German version and I'm really pissed off. Unfortunatelly this game contains a lot of bugs. I have already invested more than 10 hours into making the game run on my PC (reinstalling drivers, changeing IRQ settings, etc). To no avail - it still crashes or freezes within 5 seconds.Lots of other users of the German version seem to have the same problem (see forums). The newly released patch does not change the situation. Take care! Tom"
3,Moving mouse in demo is no fun,"I've played 2 demos of this great-looking game, and in both, movement with the mouse was nigh-impossible. It seems to be a second behind where you move it, therefore when you move your mouse to a specific location, it goes wildly past where you wanted it to go. Looking at the map and issuing orders sucks because it is so hard to steady your moves/targeting.I have a very adequate computer, so I am vexed as to why this is happening. I really want to enjoy this game! Awesome graphics, great voice-overs, cool units, seems historically accurate, no resource management....just pure battle tactics and blood and explosions! Very cool!Has anybody else experienced this mouse movement problem with the demos? If so, please email me and tell me what the problem is. I really hope I can play this game and fully enjoy it. If the full game has this same problem, it will be thouroughly unenjoyable and completely unplayable for me."
2,Outdated,We have been living in Ecuador for the last 7 months and purchased this book before leaving home to help prepare for what was to be instore for us on our arrival to Ecuador. We have found that much of the information contained is very outdated and not really that applicable. We did enjoy the section on history and as an insight into how things may have been done 10 years ago.
3,"Good information, but please disregard the author's attitude","I have never met the author, but our experience is far different and much more positive than his. Read the book for the facts and history; he does a wonderful job in those areas. But please do not judge Ecuador by the 'sore loser' tone with which he writes. Despite Mr. Crowder's experience, we moved to Ecuador as retirees. Please visit and judge for yourself. I kept this book for the cultural and historical facts, but the rest is one opinion (as is this review)."
1,Inappropriate Practice,"The test covered quite a bit of material. However, it contained many typos and incorrect answers. I would not recommend it as adequate pre-test practice."
5,What about Cheetah and Mongoose?,"As fantastic as the series is, it still can't hold a candle to such classics as Greenside and The Restricted Zone, created by the young geniuses at Ri-An Comics in the mid-eighties..."
1,A problematic system,"We just moved into an older house that had a 20 year M&S Intercom System. I saw that M&S made a retrofit unit and bought the DMC3-4 system to modernize the intercom. It has been very disappointing. The music quality is much worse due to the fact that the speakers are tiny compared to the original system. The sound reminds of a cheap 1970's transistor radio. We have also had a lot of problems with ""squawking"" noises and other types of noise interference that has made this system not very usable. The tech support from the company is very limited. They blame the existing wiring but offer little ideas or help on how to troubleshoot. I think the engineering quality of this product is very poor and I would not recommend this system."
2,Not better than your working old intercom,"I purchased this unit to replace an old 1974 intercom in my home with 12 speakers. To my surprise the old unit was many times better in sound quality of music and voice. It was difficult to install due to the connectors on the master unit. The tuner picks up a 1/3 the stations the old unit did. AM is specially bad. What a shame with all the modern technology we can't make a unit that is at least comparable with 1974!Another thing to keep in mind is that if you have at least 4 conductors in you home, use them and don't go with the 3 conductor setup. If you do, when you make an intercom call you can't listen in after the call, so the person receiving the call has to walk to the speaker to answer."
1,M&S Speaker Systems,"It is impossible to use! I am somewhat of a nerd. It was installed when we bought the home. It is a mess! We have been spending a few hours just trying to get the time to show the correct time! Don't even ask about when we tried to use it to the outdoor speakers when we had a party! I have a Master's in English and my husband is an engineer, but their instructions require more knowledge."
2,Lingerie,Was looking for something for the wife.. Found this and thought it would be nice but a little disappointed in the design there was a lot of strings that were hanging from it.. Just seemed as though it would have been better made..Amazon of course did a great job on delivery..
1,Compression finds this Edition in Dire Straits,I bought this version thinking that since it was an SACD that it would be of superior quality. Taking a tip from an earlier reviewer I downloaded Foobar which has a dynamic rang meter. I also have a remastered version from about 1997. Comparing the two the SACD version is seriously compressed and clearly inferior. Compression squeezes the life out of the music and all so that it will sound as loud as the last compressed cut just played on the radio. The 1997 version also has some tracks with light compression. I am going to try to find a 1985 release version. The loudness wars are ruining most CD releases. Too bad manufactures aren't required to print the dynamic range on the package.
3,"nice idea, but not very functional","I agree with another reviewer, in that the idea is great but the printing is misaligned, and then the whole thing does not work. My copy was a pdf download, so it should print out nicely like all other pdf documents. I've made three so far, adjusting the printer settings each time. The reason I bought the book was because I thought the idea was great and would make the memorization more fun, and this is still true (if I could get it put together correctly!) The sayings/rhymes are pretty cute and would probably help with memory, if you can get the thing to function. Some of the ones I have made will go in the trash because they were to bent up in the process of making and remaking and did not end up working in the end anyway. Pretty cumbersome final product. If I hadnt paid $1 for the book, I would be reviewing more harshly. You really could make these yourself and save some money!"
3,It's okay,"Like other reviewers stated, the dotted lines are not lined up correctly; therefore the folds are uneven. However, I would recommend this book if your students/kids are having a hard time memorizing multiplication facts."
3,Kids love it,My daughter loves this cootie catcher. She isn't learning much but she likes to play with it. I guess it really depends on how your child learns best.
1,Voice & Visions: Langston Hughes (Used from Alphacraze),"The first thirty minutes of the video was impossible to view since the image kept shifting up and down and would not hold still. I am returning the video to Alphacraze. I would like to order now the new copy of Voices & Visions:Langston Hughes, 1995 as shown in your listings. Please order for me as soon as possible. thank you."
1,never received the book,The worst ever. I have been buying textbooks on line for two years and i have received almost all my books in two weeks. It has been 5 weeks and I never got the book. I wrote two e-mails and never got a response. I also wrote an e-mail to Amazon and got no response. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE GUYS.
4,exactly right,"This is a gorgeous book, written by someone who cares about his subject matter. This book has all the charming qualities that make a great memoir. Butterfield obviously is not a writer, but he jumps into the world and makes this unique subculture familiar and beautiful for the reader."
3,These shoes were not meant for walking!,"These shoes are super cute, but not meant for long walks. I have found them to be as comfortable as you would expect a shoe with this heel height and they always get noticed and complimented."
4,Great read for kids,I borrowed this book from the library but my daughter enjoyed this book so much I came to Amazon to purchase it. Her favorite part was one I generally skip when reading. (its ok to eat macaroni in the bathtub). She insists on doing this. Overall - a great book with an essential message for todays world.
3,Pictures Not Relatable to Children - Does Not Celebrate Their Differences.,"When a child reaches for a book, think of how thrilled they are to see a book that represents them and who they are. For example, a Vietnamese girl in the 2nd grade has read many books in her classroom library and about 90% of them portray families that are white (unlike herself). How would she feel if she saw a book with a Vietnamese girl or family on the cover? Honored, Respected, Valued? Yes! But reading a book that displays children as though they are alien like, with blue and green skin is counterproductive. It says, ""let's be color blind."" That is NOT the answer. The truth is, children need to honor their culture and heritage, and can do so while respecting cultures that are different from their own. This book does not tell a child, ""It's okay to be you"" as well as it should."
5,Great Book & Author,We just discovered Todd Parr from a Kindergarten teacher at my school. With a diverse family it is so great to see his work so that my young daughter can see that there are many kinds of families and people. She loves the words and the art work. I love laughing with her during the silly parts of Todd's books. It is ok to be different!
4,Good book to introduce ideas about diversity,"This book is a good way to start a conversation with young children about the differences between people. I bought it for my sister's child. They live in a small town in Ohio that is primarily white and Christian and (based on my childhood experiences) that is also racist, anti-homosexual, etc. -- i.e., totally intolerant. I'm hoping this book will plant a seed in my nephew's head that ""it's ok"" if some people don't fit into the majority. I think this book presents that idea in an easily digestible fashion."
5,Works and washes well,"I purchased this item when some of the kittens I foster took to peeing in my bed. Unfortunately, this last group started peeing as well. I put my new mattress cover through the washing machine, and it came out fresh. I do not know if it was supposed to go in the dryer, since I couldn't find the care tag. It dried well on the shower curtain. Now this group of kittens is barred from the bedroom."
5,Great fit great product,It really fits my colt perfectly. The look and feel of the grips are great! I have Hogue grips on many of my firearms.
4,Romantic Garden,I received this book in very good condition and have been enjoying it since my purchase. I have showed it to other people and they all thought it was a wonderful and very beautiful book. I grew up not far from where the house and gardens are and it has inspired me to get back to my watercolor painting.
4,A fun read!,"Beach season has almost begun -- thus, there are various books that you might want to take with you on vacation. The Man I Should Have Married is one of them.After her husband leaves her for another woman, Kennedy feels that a fun and feisty single life is long overdue. She is determined to regain the independence she had before settling with life in suburbia. A meaningless fling with Declan -- her former boss and friend, not to mention object of her desire -- might do the trick. But she hadn't envisaged the fact that there's more to her attraction to Declan than meets the eye. To make matters worse, her teenage daughter has become insubordinate and seeks love and attention from her wayward father. There are various twists in the novel.The Man I Should Have Married is a fun novel to read on the beach. The realistic situations within the story are above most of today's women's fiction. Thus, I recommend it most highly..."
1,WHERE WERE HER SHOES?,"I almost didn't finish this book because of the GLARING error.......when Kennedy runs fromher mother's house after Maya told her that Declan was picking her up there instead of Kennedy meeting him in the city, she runs out of the house barefoot..........! They then drive to Homstead and eat dinner in an out of the way place..... an Ethiopian resturant.....a resturant that allows barefoot customers....not. The author made a point of making Kenndy barefoot and then sends her on her date and never puts shoes on her.BAD.Almost as bad as the story, writing etc. Want to read a good writer? try Good Grief"
5,Great women's literature,"I could LITERALLY not put this book down, My kids had Pizza 3 nights in a row because of it. This is a very well written book which i fould very empowering and engrossing. I can not say the same for my husband, this book was defintly written for women."
3,Okay Read.,"This book wasn't not the greatest read by any means. I just couldn't love any of the characters. Kennedy, the main character reminded me of the stereotypical ""trailer park trash."" In fact, it began to bore me to tears. Her and Declan were on again/off again....that it got redundant. Finally by pg. 240, I skipped to the end, which I never normally do, to find out where this on-going garbarge was leading.I just couldn't get into this one at all. I've been a big reader of chick lit for a while and this doesn't hold a torch to some. This author should continue writing for magazines and leave the novels to more experience writers."
2,OK but would go for higher quality,"This product is OK if you're not picky about your bras. The shape is not great, the straps come off occasionally when you're trying to tighten them. Convertible straps should be made to stay snuggly in place to prevent embarrassing moments."
1,sonic youth makes my sense of integrity hurt,"sonic youth.........where to start...how about nowhere..that seems fitting...i just wrote a huge blog after watching 1991:the year punk broke for the first time in years, and i really dont feel like repeating.so basically, anybody thats gonna buy this thing is gonna be a s.y. fan anyway so whatever i say won't matter, but.....sonic youth , and thurston moore in general, suck. a lot. i've never seen someone try so hard to use as many ""big"" words in a sentance so hard in my life. and the band as a whole seems to follow just about every underground indie trend that comes along ( if you happen to disagree, *please* go listen to your grunge obsessed copy of dirty, look at the flannel covered back sleeve, and feel that butch vig post-nevermind production)sonic is the biggest example of ""hey, i'm cool, right???"" i've ever seen..if you're gonna get all nostalgic about the late eighties/early nineties, go listen to dinosaur jr. it'll make you feel good"
5,Very Good Dvd,"This dvd is very good quality with lots of explinations and descriptions on the video's. I have seen many video collections this is honestly one of the better ones I have seen. There are lots of commentarys from the band and from a lot of other people that were in some of the videos. there are also a few live performances that are fun to listen too also. Its always nice to be able to watch every video in regular format or in commantary format... and learn how things were done, or just to get information on the videos they have. Definately worth buying. Dont sweat it."
4,Fun older Xbox game,"I really like this game, despite all the negative reviews it gets.It is a simple shooter game that has a creepy zombie feel to it. The sound effects are cool. The only complaint I have is that it is not backwards compatible for the Xbox 360."
2,"""Not the worst.""","Well, I had high expectations for this game. Ever since my dad took away my PS3, I pulled out my old XBOX. I found this game while browsing, and sine I love zombies, I decided to get it. You play as some farmer, and how he survives the attack, and I'll be honest. Just after reaching the third level, it gets really boring. For its time the graphics aren't the worst, but if you want a good zombie game, I recommend Stubbs The Zombie, its Awesome!"
3,Zombie Haven,"First of this is not RESIDENT EVIL,but if you like shooting zombies it fine. The easy level is way to easy, there is ammo EVERYWHERE!!!! So you need to play it on the hard level and there are some glitches, but for $20.00 I thought it was a cool game."
1,You should probably avoid this..,"Picked up this game tonight, and I must say that for an XBox title, this is totally unacceptible. The whole time I was thinking ""I've seen these graphics before.. hmm.. where have I seen.. I've got it! Windows 3.1"" My god, these are <u>very</u> horrible graphics. Might as well just say that it's a horrible game overall. Ammo everywhere, I'm pretty far into the game and haven't run out of ammo yet. I mean, come on, who leaves .22 rifle ammo in the sewer? The only turn that is a dead end.. predictable. There's a zombie on the ground, I bet he'll come to life. Oh! Look at that, he's walking. That's too predictable! I mean, I've seen that in Resident Evil: Code Veronica, scared the sh*t out of me, but in this case I would have to reconsider. Beware of this title, and don't get sucked in to it just because it has zombies or you will be furious with the waste."
2,land of the bad glitches...,i personally havent played the actual retail game but i played a demo for this game and to point just a few things out..the weapons sometimes wouldnt damage your enemy at all at close range..i found this to happen with the shotgun...magnum...etc also for some strange reason some of the zombies can survive a headshot from a sniper rifle...graphics were ok but overall they could have been better..if this game is coming out for the 360 your best bet would be to wait for that one.
5,Beautiful and elegant!,"This table is really good quality! It really added elegance to my room. Assembly was easy enough, too."
4,"It Works, but be careful","I have hypothyroidism, work out 6 days a week and eat healthy.I have a hard time losing weight, even eating tiny portions or juicing!BUT, I took this for a month and did nothing different and lost 3 pounds, continued for another month and lost 2 more = 5 lbs. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but for me that is huge! Here is the BUT BE careful....I suddenly started having heart palpatations and high heart rate on even 1 pill a day. I HAVE NOT GAINED THE 5 LBS BACK, and I stopped taking it 3 weeks ago. So, I would recommend starting with 1 a day and not taking it for more than a month at a time. This is not a magic pill for people who need to to lose more than 7-10 lbs, for those people - eat better and exercise at least 20 mins a day - get healthy."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"I was hoping it would work in my weight loss challenges. Sadly, it didn't have any reaction as all with me. That's just me though. It may help others."
1,Not what Dr Oz recommended,I did some more research to be able to find the ingredients on the label. This has many additional ingredients besides the Pure Green Coffee Extract. Here's the link to Source Naturals website with the other ingredients listed. Dr Oz said to have no other ingredients. [...]
2,Dr. Oz natural green coffee,"not what i thought it would be, if i took everything Dr. Oz says to take I don't think I would need to eat! He needs to simlpife it more!"
2,Waste of money. Both me and my partner tried it for a month.,This was a waste of money. We both tried it religiously for a month. We ate healthy and exercised regularly. We did not loose [or gain] a pound!
1,Was not helpful,"I tried this as a weight loss supplement, and did not notice any difference. I do follow a healthy diet and exercise routine."
5,Perfect for what I needed,"This is an easy to use, light weight brad nailer. It has done all the trim in my house beautifully."
3,Looks good but it hangs up.,"This is a good looking tool. The only problem Ive run across is after you use it a few times, the pin that pushes the brad out of the gun gets stuck in the out position. This entails having to loosen the 3 screws on the front of the gun and pushing the pin back up inside the gun.Its too much trouble to go thru in order to return the gun for a refund or repair so I guess Ill just live with it until I buy something else."
4,Works Well at Great Price,Bought 2 at a great price. Works like new. Have used it a lot and have no complaints. I will be sure an check out Tool King before buying any tools.
4,Light 18 Gauge nailer,First thing I notice was how light the unit was. So far I have only used the nailer a few times but it appears to be working well. I like the oil free feature.
2,"Bosh 18 gauge Brad Nailer, Not powerful Enough",This Bostitch brad nailer is not powerful enough and the depth setting does not work. I own a Craftsman 18 gauge brad nailer that is several years old but much more powerful. The Bostitch brad nailer will not sink the nail head completely in an oak board. The Craftsman nailer will completely sink the nail head. I do not recommend this product.
2,OK for $36 but not worth much more.,"I trimmed out a bedroom and built some shelves with this, and it works OK, but jams much more than expected. There is not a quick release to clear jams like most nailers have. I wanted something a step up from HF $20 nailer for occasional use, but this tool is not that."
2,Poor performance,"I wanted to like this nailer, but its performance was awful. I jammed or misfired at least every 5 nails! You have to loosen 3 screws to remove a jammed nail, and misfires put holes in your workpiece.The unit looked brand new and was quite light weight. I really wanted it to work for the incredible price....but alas it was too good to be true."
3,Good Deal - requires patience,"This was purchased to replace an older Husky 18ga nailer. The husky (HD house brand) was all metal, heavy and not very ergonomic.The Bostitch is made of composite plastic material and apparently some magnesium somewhere (the shroud maybe?). It is indeed light and handles nicely.However, my brief experience has been that the Bostitch jams frequently, does not seem to tolerate non-Bostitch brads and looks fragile ( I am not going to test its drop resistance intentionally) Additionally the magazine slide is made of two materials a plastic/nylon slide with a rubber bumper on the end. The bumper looks like it will fall off soon. Additionally the slide does not engage with a reassuring metal to metal click. I have to bump it pretty solidly with my palm to get to seat and then I have to examine it visually every time to ensure the slide and carriage(?) are seated into each other.But in this price range I suppose this would be adequate for an occasional user"
4,"Great tool, cannot beat the price.","Although reconditioned it looks like new. I cannot believe the price. I installed wainscoting in my kitchen this weekend and drove in over 100 2 inch nails, it never jammed on me.The depth gauge works but takes a few tests to get the correct depth."
5,"Great, practically unused","This nail gun is awesome, especially for the price. The one I received had about 6 nails missing from the pack. When I shot a few nails, they did not sink in my trim and stuck out a few millimeters. I adjusted it a few clicks and it was working perfectly. My guess is that someone bought it, tried to sink a few nails, didnt know about the adjustment, and returned it. So I probably got a brand new nailer for $32."
3,non male,"prodotto non male, nella spedizione da parte del negoziante nella fattura non vengono specicati i costi di spedizione .Per questo motivo alla dogana calcola il massimo delle spese spedizione .Si consiglia di specificare le spese di spedizione nella fattura che segue il materiale grazie"
4,Factory Reconditioned Bostitch U/BT200K-2 18 Gauge Brad Nailer Kit,"I am happy with the lightweight of this tool. It has worked well with 5/8"",1-1/4"", and 1-5/8"" brads in soft maple and plywood.I like the ability to change brad lengths without having to look for another tool.The one disadvantage thus far is there is not a slot for 1-5/8"" brads to line up with, you have to use the next length slot. But this has not been a problem yet as to the function of the tool."
2,Troublesome,"I like how light it is. However, when every sixth nail or so gets jammed in the gun it makes a carpenter very frustrated. Unacceptable performance."
1,BT200 Unusable,"I needed a replacement for the Bostitch BT35B, a steady performer that died after about 10 yrs of service. I bought a new BT200, but it is not a professional quality product replacement. It misfired about 1 out of 10 nails immediately out of the box and it now shoots 2 nails at once after trying only a couple of strips of nails. I am a professional and can't spend time with a piece of junk like this. I will never buy another Bostitch product if they perform as poorly as this one."
3,Go with the Senco,"OK for the price, should of payed the extra $$ and gone with the Senco. This Bostitch miss fires to often, won't last the time the old Senco performed for me."
5,Great Nailer and Great Price!,"I am in the process of installing wood floors in my home and since I was going to be taking up the trim I needed a nail gun to make the installation of the trim go faster. When I received the box from Tool King I thought the case was empty because it was so light! This gun is the magnesium line and it is very light and durable. The plastic case it comes in weighs more. I wanted to test it out since I would not be ready for trim for a couple of weeks, so I fixed a kitchen drawer and a couple of window ledges with it. Plus I have heard good things about the Bostitch product line from friends. I highly recommend...can't beat the price!"
4,Unbeatable Deal,"Tool is lightweight, functions as described, and is priced incredibly low. Occasionally throws a spark when driving a brad, but everyone knows not to operate pneumatic nail guns near flammable sources. Would recommend product to my peers."
4,Bostitch U/BT-200K-2,Nice light weight. When jams easy removal of nail. 95% of time shoots nails smoothly. Just bought this a couple of weeks ago and works pretty well.
3,"Beautiful design, space saving TV... but","I upgraded to the flat screen, went full HD 1080p, sized up from 32"" regular TV to this Toshiba 42"" but have not really noticed a remarkable difference in actual picture quality even having had Time Warner switch the old boxes with HDTV boxes and entirely rewiring the house. Maybe the difference is too subtle for me to notice? That being said the TV itself would get 4 1/2 stars - it is beautiful, designed well, flat screen, even though the sound seems to fluctuate from channel to channel. I love it, but wish I would notice the remarkable difference I hear everyone talking about."
1,Busted,"It looks great but unfortunately I have not been able to use my Toshiba Regza as during the shipping process it was damaged. EGL delivered the TV late with the box in a terrible state which looked like it had been dropped and dragged. The LCD screen is shattered which can only be seen when it is turned on. Suggestion from Amazon ""I would be more than willing to refund you 10% of the total order, which would be $128.00, for keeping the item. If that doesn't work for you I can issue a replacement free of charge. Since this item does require a specialty shipper we would not be able to expedite the shipment."" Hopefully this gets resolved as I have faith that Amazon values their customers.Toshiba REGZA 42HL167 42"" 1080p LCD HDTV"
1,Very poor OTA reception,"Quick heads up,I have three HD TV's and the other two both get fantastic reception but this one gets nothing and even the SD channels are poor or didnt scan at all. High quality antennas did nothing to help the situation. I live near downtown in the nations third largest city and can see the broadcast antenna but that means nothing with this TV! BTW if you are not standing dead in front of it forget it!Regards,Get a Sony or Sammy"
1,Extremely dissapointed,"After living with an old 1980's CRT tv for about 5 years, I finally took the plunge and bought my first ever flatscreen, the Toshiba 42HL167. I received this about 2 hours ago and let me tell you, it's great looking at a black screen!! After reading many reviews about the greatness of this set, it looks like I got a lemon. The tv will not come out of standby mode and I can't get it to turn on to save my life. I know that this tv ranks pretty high, but based on my experience I have to warn people to stay far away from this set. I should have trusted my gut and went with a Samsung, they have never failed me."
1,Stick with a CRT,"If you want to pay big bucks for the LCD and Plasma craze, then go ahead. I myself purchased one of these and I'm sorry that I did. Biggest misuse of funds I've ever made. The picture quality on digital (non-HD) channels is almost unwatchable. The HD channels are nice, especially for live sporting events, however there aren't enough true HD channels out there yet. These LCDs are still quite heavy and you need a haning device the size of TX to hang it from your wall. I'm going to stick with my large and very heavy CRT. The picture of any CRT will beat an LCD or Plasma hands down. I'm sure many will disagree with that statement, but try a side by side comparison for yourself and you will see through the hype."
4,Great Picture,"Well defined picture in HD, very useful and convenient remote especially with cable service. Toddler has touched screen and left marks we are unable to remove- tough to clean screen."
4,very pleased,Very pleased with this television. we did tons of research and think it was well worth it. great picture. great value. looks nice. we havent really noticed the green push you hear about - but we found the settings online in the service menu if it becomes apparent.nice tv. delivery was earlier than expected and good service.
3,toshiba 42hl167,LCD has great picture quality but really bad sound quality. I was really impress about the clarity in the view but the sound was really disappointing.
1,BUYER BEWARE!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,I have a similar Toshiba 47LZ196 that I paid $3499.99 for in Dec. 2006 that is just under 1 year and 2.5 months old and the panel ($3400.00) crapped out on me. After being informed by multiple Toshiba reps that I was in the window to receive assistance I was informed NOTHING would be covered and I was responsible for the cost of the part and repairs. What a joke for a higher end flat panel. One year and almost $4000.00 down the old crapper. Such a shame since I really liked that tv.
1,Bad Decision!,I read some reviews on this model TV that said the picture would go black for no reason and that the customer(s) were dissatisfied. I should have listened to those reviews. I too had the same problem with my Regza. The picture goes black and may come back from time to time but it continues to go black. This was after only a couple of yearss after buying it. I won't purchase a Toshiba in the future. Buyer beware
1,Problems already,"Purchased this TV in Dec 2007 from REX TV (so ya know how their service is since out of business), already has verticles developing in the picture before I even own it 3 years. Up until this point the picture quality was great, an LED set should last approx. 60,000 hours. Im going with an LG this time and capture those great prices and reduced warranties on Amamzon.com."
1,Screen broke for no reason after a year!,"We purchased the TV brand new from our local electronics store.After owning the TV approximately eighteen months, we awoke one morning to find the inner screen shattered. Nobody had touched it during the night and it was perfectly fine the night before.The extended warranty we had purchased for the TV was useless as the warranty company refused to fix the TV because they said we must have abused the TV.So, we wasted almost $2000 for a television that lasted a year and a half.We will never buy another Panasonic TV or LCD TV. We went with plasma for the replacement television."
1,Bad LCD panel after 16 months,"I purchased this TV along with a HD-DVD player in May 2007 and I thought it was a pretty good TV after doing extensive research and looking at the picture quality.The worst case scenaio just happened this weekend during the football game- the LCD panel went bad a little more than 3 months outside of the warranty. After talking to Toshiba, I had an authorized tech out to check it. He voltmetered one connector on the main panel and said the board on the LCD is bad but they don't make that part so you have to replace the whole panel. The panel is not cost effective to replace since a brand new set will cost just as much. Toshiba would not offer any financial assistance whatsoever after speaking to a supervisor. They said the set is too old.Bottom line- if you are going to buy this TV get an extended warranty. A TV this expensive should last more than 16 months. The TV and the defunct HD-DVD player were a total bust. AVOID TOSHIBA!"
1,Awful Customer Service,"I was happy with the TV when I bought it but it broke after about 8 months (wouldn't turn on). The TV is still under factory warranty but it's been almost 4 weeks and the replacement chip I apparently need is still on backorder! Toshiba can't tell me when my TV might be fixed because they don't even know when they'll receive the required part! In fact, they don't even know for sure whether this part will fix the problem!!! Next time I'll pick a brand that does a better job of standing behind their products."
2,"Good picture, awful customer service","This TV has a great picture, which is the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1. We had it for about 2 to 3 months when it started randomly turning off and back on again. Toshiba's website ""tech"" support provided no help whatsoever, just said take it to an authorized repair shop.Toshiba told the repair shop that they have no time frame for the needed parts to ship out. The repair shop has many other Toshiba TVs that have been waiting for parts for weeks and months. I wouldn't waste my money on a Toshiba again."
4,Very good HD LCD at a reasonable price,"I had seen these in action before buying, and also saw this model as a Consumer Reports best buy. The set is great - it was easy to set up, and the display is superb. It was delivered via freight, but aside from a delay (due to the local service) no problems.All in all, a good purchase and no regrets."
3,"Sorry to say it's a ""no"" for me","I wanted to like this TV, but had to return it after 2 weeks. Maybe it's because I have the Panasonic TH-50PZ700U plasma and have gotten completely spoiled by it. The picture on the Toshiba doesn't compare to my Panasonic even though both are 1080p. Maybe I just prefer plasma over LCD, but the standard channels aren't nearly as crisp and even the HD picture seems bland. This is probably because the blacks just aren't as pronounced on the Toshiba.I had a few other issues with this TV. For some reason the set would lose video occasionally while switching channels. Had to unplug it for video to come back. As another reviewer noted, the picture from side view of the TV is horrible. Lastly, I couldn't find a picture size that I liked - Theaterwide 1 worked OK for HD channels but was a bit too zoomed in, Natural worked OK for standard channels but they seemed somewhat blurry.Unfortunately this TV was just average - too bad, as I got a great deal on it."
3,The 2nd REGZA was fine. The first was damaged in shipping and trying to get it replaced was a challenge.,When you by a set from Amazon the delivery company puts it together but they take off before you can plug it in and test it. Make sure that your set is operating properly before you sign the delivery sheet. The set we received had a screen that was damaged in shipping and it took several days and numerous emails and phone calls before they would replace it.
5,Exceptional Holst biography!,"Holst was a gentle soul of rare talent and accomplishment. Exceptionaly well researched and well written biography. This is THE standard Holst biography. Why this is out of print is a complete mystery. May be available at your local library -- if you're lucky. I was and read it. I would very much like to obtain a copy. So, whoever has rights to publishing this work, perhaps another printing or a new edition is in order? Where else is one to go for a thorough Holst biography? Highly recommended."
2,ridicule,"well I buyed this one, and I have to say I lost a bit of money.the author knows very little of what he is talking about, and that little that he knows he is not able to explain in a usefull way. Plus all the book is focused on a hand-made web application that has NOTHING to do with real world scenarios. Do yourself a nice thing and look around for something better.Some usefull info can be found here only for people that are beginners with browsers usage."
4,Very good read,"Although other reviews stated there was no action and the hero was just ""nice"", I thought this was a pretty good read. Characters were well developed, no loose ends, and a satisfying ending. There was drama, paranormal activities, villains, etc....everything that you would expect and more. I appreciated the length of the book -no novella here."
3,Book just so so.,Not bad but kind of a formula historical romance adventure tals. Good if a reader is addicted to romance novels. Predictable. Reader had to know how it would turn out so reading it seemed a waste of time.
3,Saint Micheal,"I would only recommend this to people who know and love medival times. The story starts slow and at points is really hard to visualize throughout, but this may be different for those who know of medival times"
4,Fun!,This was a good read! I liked the characters. The fact that she just does her best to resist him and he just proves how great of a person he is is fun to read. It's heartwarming to read about people who come from two different worlds are able to still put aside their differences for love. Great book!
4,Quite a different hero!,"Gavin Faulkener isn't like most Englishmen in 14th c. Scotland: He has some morals. Christian MacGillean, a relative of the outlawed Scots king, Robert Bruce, is wholly like most Scots: She despises the English. Faulkener weds the lady, to save her from a slow, horrid death; is awarded her property; and is stuck between doing the bidding of his king and doing what is right by his new wife. He chooses wisely, but the choice isn't quite as simple as it seems.This is a lovely novel by Susan King, and a thoroughly enjoyable one. The hero, Faulkener, is compassionate, intelligent, shrewd and simply charming. Lady Christian couldn't hold out against him, and neither could I!"
3,A light read,"Interesting in a historical sense, but somewhat repetitious. A bit drawn out. It could have had more action or drama.."
2,"words, words, and more words","I found the pages weighted down with grief. Nothing broke the depressing spell these characters were under. I could not shake the feeling of hopelessness for this couple. They didn't do anything to inspire me. I stopped caring about what might happen to them and just wanted to find what happens next, if anything. Will she be captured again and held prisoner? Raped? Killed? humm. I wonder ... <nothing happening> Gavin might have to fight for her release if she were caught again; he could be killed!?. <still nothing happening> Maybe a battle will break out and everyone will die ... Would something just HAPPEN already!Gavin was simply the 'nicest' hero I've ever come across in a romance novel. There was scant intimacy between the two. I found myself dreaming that a stronger character would just sweep into this ruined castle, drag Christian off by her short crop of hair, and um, well you know."
2,Condition of purchased item,"Receipt of the book purchsed was timely as anticipated, however the condition of the book was disappointing and disconcerting. The book dinding was split from the backing and as I read, the unbound pages came loose. Since the book originated from the La Mesa Library ( Library ID and record of use was still featured on the inside cover) I can only assume that one of the reasons this book became available to whomever obtained it, was it's poor condition. Perhaps I should have expected this when opting to purchase a used book through Amazon."
3,okay,This product is ok. It shipped quickly. The grass looks more realistic than the cacti. Not bad for the price.
2,"Pretty, but doesn't work.","I received two of these, and neither one worked. It looks pretty enough, but is useless as a timepiece. Sadly had to get my money back."
3,Child Liked OK,"Our 20-month old saw the pictures of this book and ""Dunk Skunk"" on the dust jacket of ""You Can Do Anything Daddy"" and would always point them out when we would read YCDAD. So, I purchased both Truck Duck and Dunk Skunk. He LOVES Dunk Skunk, but Truck Duck doesn't capture his attention and finds it boring, despite his affinity towards vehicles and other modes of transport."
4,"Excellent Anecdotes and Hints, But Photos Could Be Better","I write as an intermediate amateur photographer (with no intention of turning professional) who is about to photograph my first wedding. The Hurth and Hurth book has over 100 photos of weddings, many of them classy, but I think the photos have two problems. First, many are too small to show important details. Second, less than a third of the photos are in color, and the color is not reproduced very vividly. On the other hand, I liked the extensive text, especially the grey ""Shooter's Log""s with anecdotes about things that go wrong at weddings, and the grey ""Reader's Note""s in the sidebars with helpful hints."
3,Informative but dated.,This was informative for the aspiring wedding photographer. It was however a bit dated in both its style and the included photographs. The author needs to write an updated version and include photographs from this decade!
1,Could hear but couldn't speak,"Kind of defeats the point. I could hear someone quietly through the earpiece- but was not heard when I spoke. I don't know what I was expected paying so little, I guess I was hoping against the odds. But you get what you pay for... next time I'll buy from someone legitimate."
1,Ineffective at best,"This DVD is not worth the money! I expected to have some insight specifically geared to JRT's and found nothing aside from very basic information that is common sence and would apply to any dog. The training section is basic, out-dated and of no use. Save your money and go online for ""free"" clicker training."
4,A victory for original thinking,"When I first got Ro Sham Bo by The Grays, Buddy Judge's songs were the ones I liked the least. But five years on, they're the ones i like the best. Profiles in Clownhenge is a lush record full of brass instrumentation and songs which are both funny and touching. If you like Jon Brion or Jason Falkner, you cannot lose with this one. Buddy's take on 'Send on the clowns' is perfect, 'Xmas in Clownhenge' is wonderfully insane, and 'Just Another Girl' is classic Bud and Dan pop."
1,NOT WORTH THE EFFORT,"I have found this book to be highly speculative, on the part of the author. The only existing ""facts"" lay in previously printed material. Much of the book deals with what Clinton ""must "" have felt, or even worse what he ""was thinking"". It is my opinion that, one would be better of reading two separate books. One about Clinton's life and another about sexual addiction, since all this book does is perpetuate what most of us would like to keep just where it belongs. In the Presidents private dwelling."
1,Who would buy this?,"Prima Publishing, a small company known for appealing to a market segment of right-wingers who have $24.95 to throw around on tacky books like the Starr Report, was counting on this book to be their big bestseller this year. Whoops. It's a clumsily-written analysis of Clinton that will surprise no one. Near the end of the book, the author -- some bearded, wild-eyed quack who no one else would publish -- appeals for the President to get help by going to see a therapist like the author himself. How touching."
3,Good power strip but not the color shown,"I got this power strip for my work shop. It seems well made and works as expected. The only issue is it is not a silver color as shown in the product photo but a sort of cream colored metal. I kept it as the color doesn't matter too much to me in a workshop, but would be nice if it was as advertised."
1,Scammed out of my money,"THERE IS NO OPTION TO RETURN THIS. IT IS NOT EVEN WHITE, ITS GREEN. HAS NO PLUG SO I CAN EVEN USE IT. CAN'T FIND A WAY TO EVEN TRY TO USE IT WITHOUT HIRING A ELECTRICIAN. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING IT AND USUALLY I DO, BUT I DIDNT THINK I WOULD BE SCAMMED LIKE THIS."
1,Why sell this without the cable?!?!?!?!,bought this hoping to get a simple plug and play. If I would've known I had to run the wire myself...It would've been cheaper to go to home depot and buy one that is already put together. The thick cable to handle the current along with the proper fitting ended up costing about 20 bucks. So overall I spent over 50 bucks for this. Not a good deal at all. I found this same power strip with the cable for 2 more dollars than what this one cost.
3,Hard to wire up.,"This is a useful power strip with one fault. The outlets at the ends of the strip are so close to the knockout holes that the threads on an installed fitting interfere with the wiring. The wiring can be bent to avoid the fitting, but it is not real easy to do with the 12 gauge solid wire inside the strip. I got around the problem by cutting the ends off the fittings to shorten them before installing, but I should not have had to do it."
1,Fail,The circuit breaker tripped after a few months. I tried the re-set - no go. It was irreparably burned out.
2,Color not as shown,"The color of this is not aluminum. It is a neutral nasty cream color. I bought it to go in my kitchen, but am returning to see if I can find something that actually looks like the picture."
2,Tripp Lite Power Strip,"I ordered 2 of this item for exposed wall applications under our kitchen cabinets. It turned out they are for industrial use. So I am installing one horizontally in my workshop, and am in doubt about what to do with the other.The product description is rather vague in my opinion. Actually, they are too ugly for what we wanted. As for form, fit and function, they are perfect, but you need to mention they are galvanized, and shop ugly. We found somewhat like we were looking for at Home Depot but had to shorten the six [6] feet of cord. ARRRGH! SW."
4,hardwired outlet strips,"Due to the stupidity of overly stringent interpretation of fire codes, I am required to hardwire rather that use corded outlet strips for my computers and music gear. I might ultimately have 200 devices plugged in and yet draw only 20 or 30 amps total (and not on a single circuit) but I have to satisfy a fire chief who's out to make it as inconvenient and expensive as possible for me to operate a business in this jerkwater town. These are the only reasonably priced option available to pack a lot of outlets into a convenient hardwired package (WireMold's gotten very expensive as a brand)"
2,languid,"I was unimpressed by this book. The hero's occupation of hunting down all sorts of unusual objects for his clients was interesting, but nothing much happens for many many pages, and when the mystery develops it's not that gripping. Well written, but the plot doesn't satisfy. Plus the twist at the end wasn't a surprise."
1,Horrible book!,"I am a first year medical student and this was the required textbook for our neuroscience class. This is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered. The book is full of inconsistencies and incorrect information. The way the material is presented is very confusing and the text is poorly written at best. Moreover, the book lacks key information that is tested on boards and clinically relevent. Furthermore the diagrams are confusing and poorly drawn. Save your money and DO NOT buy this book."
5,"Intellectually challenging, yet perfectly clear","Paul's book is excellent for making clear to readers the essential differences between philosophies of research, largely through the second part of the book, in which research questions are developed by alternative methodologies. While the book is structured as a text, it will be of interest to anyone who is a critical consumer of research reports. Not only will I use this with my research students, but I will also use it as a refresher for course design."
4,very interesting,I used this book in my 20th century music class. The composers share very interesting information on their composing processes. It's a great book.
3,Okay biography,"In this biography of the leading theologian of the social gospel, Minus does a good job of tracing Rauschenbusch's history and family. Less covered though, and something I felt was important to understanding the man, was coverage of his political and social beliefs - these are touched upon, but aren't the subject of much study. Minus also tends to overlook flaws of Rauschenbusch, preferring an overly praising view of the man. I have not read other biographies of Rauschenbusch, so this may be the best. If so, it is well worth reading, regardless of its flaws, as this is a man certainly worthy of study."
4,"Nicely spaced outlets, lots of coax; better models out there at this price","I recently bought a number of medium grade surge protectors to see what's out there. I really like this model--the outlets are spaced nicely--you could plug in 10 power bricks if you needed to--the joule rating is pretty decent at 4200. The unit feels well-made and heavy, but it is all plastic. Without comparing it to other models at the $50-$70 price point, it's a fine surge protector in terms of build and outlets. But comparing it to similarly priced units from other vendors and the build quality isn't quite as a nice--Belkin has a unit that is only $10 more, metal construction, and a built-in cord management system to reduce clutter. So shop around and try to see these in person if that kind of thing matters to you. However, if you're looking for the cheapest medium grade surge protector--or if you need to protect against surges in 3 coax sources--this will do the trick."
5,Great Call,The call is well made and fun to use. We have really enjoyed using it. Instructions for use are also included.
1,Not what I expected! :(,This doesn't even sound like a duck...not at ALL! Highly disappointed...when I waited anxiously to get it! I mean not at ALL...not even close! :(
3,I Guess that You Have to Have it,"It has some good information in it, but not great. If you are going to coach amateur boxing, it is a must have I guess."
4,Decent Drives,"I have two of these drives set to mirror each other in my RAID Array. They are quick and seem reliable. They are a bit noisy during read/write, but sitting idle is hardly noticeable."
4,"Experience in Purchasing Hard Drives, WD RE2 WD5000ABYS 500Gb",".... Bought these drives NEW(3), WD RE2 WD5000ABYS 500Gb., based on the manufacturer and spec sheet and warranty(5 years). Received shipment with 1 year warranty that had expired or close to it according to info on the individual drives from a sub group or supplier of Amazon.com. After many hours of conversation and sending proof of purchase to Western Digital we finally resolved this issue and I received my 5 year warranty as was part of the sale. I might add here, buying individual hard drives regardless of the manufacturer these days, is like trying to buy HEN's teeth anymore. I just do NOT know (or understand) what the BIG deal is. Something like this should have been easily resolved with a 2 or 3 minute phone call..... The drives are doing well and I am satisfied with the purchase.Thank you"
4,incorrect shipping weight,"*Update 08-19-2010*Despite the company that this came from, this drive has been running faithfully since I bought it, and I am very satisfied with it's performance and durability. I have moved several times, carefully, and never a glitch.I will update this review once I receive the HDD. This is to inform anyone who might purchase this that the shipping weight of 15lbs is incorrect. As of Jan 16th 08 the error has not been corrected. I contacted Electronics Direct, and after 15 mins of them telling me that I did something wrong, they conceded that a 1.7 pound HDD is probably not going to be shipped in a 15 pound container. They investigated and found out that they had sent the incorrect info to Amazon. They did refund the difference in shipping, but I doubt I will ever buy from them again, after getting hung up on twice."
5,Great Book!,"This book addresses the topic of entertainment in today's church. It is a great book from a great ministry, The Berean Call, and raises important questions of the discernment of Christians in today's churches."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received the table. Not only the quality was poor, it came in damaged. I am now skeptical about making another online furniture purchase."
1,Total waste of time and money,"I bought this game based on the only review listed for this game. I'm not sure what game the other reviewer was playing, but I doubt this was it.On each mission you have no way to save the game without going through a checkpoint. Also, there are no health packs to grab during the game, so if your health is running very low and the game is automatically saved at a checkpoint, you must start that area with a low health score, finding it near impossible to finish the level you are at.One of the levels had a choice of a sniper rifle, which took forever to reload, and didn't give the option of a manual reload which meant if you were getting fired upon, you would likely die (certainly quicker if your health was very low) while reloading.On a particular mission, the ""friendlies"" were firing on me, which shouldn't happen in any game.Overall the game is very bad and gets the lowest possible score from me."
4,One of the better Sunfire titles,"Jessica has double the usual number of potential suitors for a Sunfire book-- four!! Anyway, I enjoyed this one, and I liked it better reading it at 20 than I did at 12-- the detailed accounts of prairie life, relizing that one's first love may just be an infatuation that would never quite work out. Unlike some of the other Sunfires, this is an eduring title."
1,"Oh, please......","Brad King's book, Fat Wars left me wanting a return on my investment. I have read this information before. Its out there, just look up almost any title. I can't help but suspect that Mr. King is just ""jumping on the band wagon"" of gimmicks for fat loss and healthful living hoping to make a fast dollar. His dietary outline is so narrow, only the simple minded would adhere to it. I strongly suggest you purchase another book by another author. Bill Phillips ""Body for Life"" comes to mind. Bill Phillips' is a worthwhile book to read and devote your health to, and well worth the investment!!!!"
5,"Prepare for a new you, for anyone who wants a transition.","After watching Brad King on a morning talk show, I immediately bought his book FAT WARS. Because I am into fitness and nutrtion and very curious on how a body works with food, this book literally explains it step by step in understanding language. Once you read this book and UNDERSTAND how your body works, what the cells do and so forth, anybody can transform their body. This book educates you RATHER than telling you what to do."
1,Vogon poetry?,"This is perhaps the worst attempt at poetry I've ever seen comitted to paper. It's full of gross, artless metaphor and charmless descriptive phrases, like ""That I have felt her velvet pudendum against my groin; and suffered, oh how I suffered! The ecstasy of abandonment, Peter's salt in my bowel, Satan's nightlight in my burned out eyes?""And it gets worse."
2,A dissapointment,"I purchased this item as a donation to a local animal shelter that had run out of cat toys. The item did not come in a nice clear canister as shown, but in a dingy plastic bag that had been squashed into a cardboard box so that several of the plastic balls were broken. I considered returning the product but decided the shelter's need for the toys outweighed the time it would take to get a replacement."
1,Appalling,"There are two reviews giving this book 5 stars, and they're both by the author. Isn't that convenient?The book is more worthless drivel by yet another crackpot (physics quack as Prof Siegel of SUNY Stony Brook calls them) who claims to have overthrown Einstein."
5,This is the one.,"If you're only going to spend money on one CD, this is the one to buy. The original material plays like a set of standards and makes you want to hum along. They play an excellent range of styles and moods. It could only be better live."
1,Hard to say...,"if the performance of the product is no better than another as I did not tryto replace it but simply removed it from the installation after itconstricted the water flow out of the shower head. It was a bigdisappointment not to have the option of adding a detachable headwith this device, it makes cleaning the shower much more difficult."
4,An Amazing Little Book,These stories were a amazing. The girls and their funny stories. The best one was about Martha and Bess's rat proplem. These stories take place around 1950's and the 1500's.
3,Wrong product.,"I believe I ordered the wrong flux for jewelry, but if I ever need some for plumbing, this should be fine,"
5,ok,ok people responsible arrive on time and in perfectc onditionthe product works great and my wife is very happy with his dremmel
4,Very Nice,"Very Nice. I have been hearing various cuts in Atlanta on WRFG. Thank God for independent radio! I found ""We"" on a mixed CD. Glad to finally put an Artist to a song. This CD/EP is defeinitely worth a listen if you can pull yourself off the mainstream nipple and expand some gray matter."
4,Want a high score? You still might not want this book,"The fact that this book contains a formidable 15 exams, dwarfing its competitors in the sheer number of tests offered, alone makes this book a valuable purchase for somebody seeking a VERY high score on the Math IIC. If your target score is not above a 750, this is not the book for you. I am a very good math student and could not finish a single exam, and my highest score was a 700 flat. I highly recommend buying this book in tandem with Kaplan Math IIC. Kaplan is notoriously easier than Barrons or Princeton (neither of which are as hard as this). Do as many Meylani tests as you can, then with 5 days before the exam, do a few Kaplan exams to get your confidence up, as Kaplan is largely accurate to the actual exam. Using the Meylani was very helpful to me, and made the actual exam seem significantly easier than it would have been otherwise."
3,You might not need this book.,"Most materials in the test are not necessary for you to know if you want to take SAT. You don't need the sheer frustration of going through this book without knowing how to do a single problem. Well, that was a little exaggerated, but honestly, I don't think it's a good prep book for SAT, since the difficulty level and the complexity of the problems are much higher than you'll see in SAT II math, thus makes it very unrealistic and useless. I used this book, along with Kaplan and Baron for my SAT prep. Tho I got 800 on SAT II Math, I don't think my success has much to do with this book."
1,This book is plain bad.,"This book is plain bad - the English is horrible on word problems, necessary parts of drawings are left out, etc.Do not buy this book - you will be much better off with one from a reputable publisher who EDITS their publications."
5,Hahn brings it home...again!,"As a former Protestant preacher and now Catholic speaker and evangelist, I have searched for good Bible studies to share with our Parish. As usual, Scott Hahn delivers. This theology professor and convert to the Catholic Church knows how to make the Scriptures make sense.He ties the Old and New Testaments together, showing how the Bible has a continuous thread and consistent theme.The study follows the salvation history from Genesis through Acts, and includes Scripture references, study questions, and references to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.In order to make the most of the study, you should have a copy of the Catechism, and should also purchase the videos that are available (3 videos for about $60).As a Bible teacher, I can confidently and enthusiastically recommend this study...you will enjoy it as much as my study group has.Michael A. Maturen, B.S., M.Div., D.Phil. candidate"
2,Used but not 2003,We knew we were getting a used book but it was supposed to be 2003 or 2005 - not 1995.
3,Good for those who have a reason to avoid oil.,"I just had to try these to see what the little sardines packed in nothing but water would be like. And, I get a chance to find out what an oil-less sardine tastes like.Well, they taste like sardines without the oil, and if you are a sardine fan like me you might want to try this once to see what they're like. They actually taste rather fresh, and the water is way easier than oil to get off your hands and the kitchen counter if you happen to spill some.Once I had the can open, I put them in a bowl and covered them in honey mustard and sea salt and warmed them up. Then I ate them on crispbread (those big flat bread crackers). Not a bad snack at all, but I'm going back to the ones packed in olive oil."
4,Was in his class used the book,"Professor Turco taught his poetry class at Oswego State using this book - though it has been almost 9 years since I took poetry 1 and 2 with Turco, the lessons he taught me have never left me. The book, the class, the entire Lewis Turco experience is a memory I wont soon forget. When I started the class I was incensed at his pompous, know it all audacity in making us use his forms and methods and being a very strict and harsh grader. By the end of the class I had gotten the hang of sylabics, etc. and was writing poetry with the best of them and loving it. His methods WORK, dont give up half way through, and if you can take a class with him, do so - I think he may have retired."
5,The Absolute Foremost Guide for Poets and Lovers of Poetry,"Turco has condensed the entire craft of poetry into less than 300 meaty pages, packed with vital info. If you're looking to learn about the mechanics of poems or just simply looking for something exciting to write besides sonnets, haiku, and free verse, this book WILL have what you need. It is a veritable fount of knowledge that will keep flowing even after your Muse has hit the road."
4,Toshiba DKR2,"I like this unit so much, I bought a refurb when my first one died.The primary value of this unit is its ability to record RAM disk, which allows recording copy protected programming. It can only be played back on this unit, which has obvious drawbacks, but I love it.The UI is clunky and I've never been able to master the editing features, but as I said - I bought this for the RAM disk recording, not to create portable DVD's."
4,GOOD PRODUCT!!!!,"THE PICTURE IS EVEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO OPERATE AT FIRST. BUT, I AM HAPPY WITH IT..YOU CAN'T BEAT IT FOR THE PRICE."
4,A wealth of knowledge,"I never knew there was such a book but it anwsers many questions I have had. Since it has been out of print for so long it is great to have gotten one to add to my library. I would have possibly liked it better had it been arranged in chronological order rather than alphabetical. Could have had more pictures and maps too, maybe in the 2nd edition!"
5,worked perfectly but...,"I bought this bulb a couple of months agoand i thought it would work perfectlywith my projector but i was wrongi mean don't get me wrongthe picture was great with this bulband there wasn't anywarm tint you would see with otherbulbsbutthe bulb was getting so hot that myprojector kept turning offevery couple of minutes""that's sort of my fault becausemy projector was only meantfor a 65w bulb not a 75w""i think i'm going to have to buya hot mirror so my projector won't shut offevery couple of minutes."
1,Manufacturer packed wrong vent shade in box.,"Purchased vent shade for 2010 Tahoe. Ordered correct model number for truck. Received correct box, but wrong vent shade was in the box (labeled for an older model truck). Box was sealed, looks like a factory mistake. Amazon received product back, but slow to issue credit for return. What a hassle."
3,A less than production for a classic series,"I am not positive that this listing is the same as mine. I am refering to the 3 pack edition which the BBC put together from 1988-1990. While the story line is carefully followed, the acting is terrible, the costumes seem to be leftovers from the Dr. Who series, and the sound is often times muffled and difficult to understand. So, as an adult I would give it three stars, BUT, AS A CHILD... MY CHILDREN SIMPLY LOVED IT AND WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS!!!"
5,Quality Made Product for Home Theaters,"I use this in my home theater and have been nothing but impressed by the quality of this product. It has a solid metal housing that I know will take a lot of abuse.The mounting brackets can be moved so that it can be secured to the back of media cabinet. Also since the plugs are on the sides, the cabinet can then be pushed against the wall without adding stress on the cables.The only problem I encountered was trying to open the box that covers the switch. The lid's hook is hard to reach and required me to pry it open with a flat head screw driver. This would not have been a problem if it wasn't that it shipped with the switch turned off.I know I will purchase more of these in the future."
4,Better than studio recordings,"An excellent, excellent cd. Jason Mraz is a talented singer. This recording gives listeners a chance to hear his great voice in a small venue without the screaming 13 year olds. If you enjoyed Waiting for my Rocket to Come but thought Mr A-Z was a big let down, give Live at Java Joe's a try."
5,Speechless,"I originally bought this CD when it was only available on Jason Mraz's website several months ago. For Mraz fans, it showcases a completely different side of Jason. The recording simply has Jason and Tocca playing at Java Joe's; it's strictly acoustic. The songs are a lot longer, and there are only two that were actually released to the public on his debut album. When you listen carefully to the hooks, though, you can hear bits and pieces of what is now ""The Remedy"" sprinkled throughout all the songs. An essential for Mrazites, it truly shows how far he has come, and how talented he is with words, vocals, and guitars. The album is made even better by the fact that all of the jokes and interactions with the audience members are recorded, which gives greater insight into his amazing man's personality. Buy it! You'll love it!"
3,Shipment,I'm having problems with the shipment of this product. I live in Brazil and other order that has been sent 7 days after it is already here with me. I'll still be waiting this product...Live & Acoustic
5,Best beach tunes!,This is the best beach album I own- perfect for lazy nights on the dock watching the sunset :)
5,Wow!,"I didn't know how much I would love Jason Mraz till I got this download as the deal of the day. I only knew the songs that I've heard on the radio, but thought I'd give this one a shot. I finally listened to it today and can only say WOW! This guy has an incredible voice and this is really fun cd! I will be downloading more of his stuff now that I know how much I love him! Really enjoyable!"
2,No answer key,This has a great Glossary Key in the back to look up words and definitions. But it has no answer key to check your answers to the exercises...so you never know if your answers and sentences are written correctly or not. I do not recommend this book.
3,"Another, in a line of mediocre Step II books","If you read the other reviews...they just about say it right: the book you need if you want to PASS. However, NOT the book you need if you want to do WELL. This book has lots of pages and lots of words, but it doesn't seem to say all that much. It's not detailed enough, and I also think that many of the treatments discussed could use a bit of updating. I wasn't so immpressed."
5,Best boards book ever,"This book is comprehensive yet easily managed in a short period of time. It breaks subjects down into digestible pieces that are easy to interconnect and memorize. I found this book to provide the most accurate estimation of the material presented on the USMLE Step II. In fact, I have used it for all three steps and have scored highly. I cannot recommend this book more strongly. It is also an excellent review for clinical medicine as well. Buy this book!"
2,bare bones only,"This book is a lot of pages for very low yield. I learned nothing new from reading it. If you want a basic skeleton that you can flesh out with your own notes, then this book has lots of space to for added notes. But it certainly is not sufficient by itself. It tells a little bit about everything in the most basic way. I prefer more concise books that highlight key points or give ""buzzwords"". From that point of view, ""Crush the Boards"" is a better book. But for those who want only to pass Step 2, then ""Prescription"" may suit their needs."
3,Next To Last Harrah,"If you are a long time fan, as am I, you will enjoy seeing Jackie performing in this historic site. Jackie even leads us on an abbreviated tour of the venue as part of the bonus material. The concert material is new but all the familiar patterns of delivery remain unchanged. ""Hey mister! What do you think?...I mean for a man in your condition..."" He does miss a beat or two... It is, nevertheless, satisfying to watch a familiar old ""friend"" who has entertained us for decades basking in the twilight of his career and clearly wowing the audience.....Addenda: I recently saw Jackie in person in a limited engagement before taking his current act to Broadway.He does a wonderful riff on free speech and condemns the government's attempt to censor Howard Stern and the other edgy radio personalities.Finally, if you are from the ""gressa"" Jackie fans you won't want to miss an opportunity to add this album to your collection"
2,With age the luster dulls,"Jacki's done much better work than this and I attribute it in part to his age now. He's much less animated than he used to be.I didn't find anything original in this performance and for those that find him very funny, like myself, this is a poor example."
4,Gravitas.,"Jackie Mason is one of the few entertainers with the type of gravitas that allows for his expropriating a movie title from the Marx Brothers and having it work about as well as the original. I got kind of a kick out of his appearance here due to his dress. He walks out in an all black suit looking like an older version of Joe Pesci. Overall, I don't think this performance is as good as the others on DVD. He seemed rather tired and lacked his usual intensity. Some of the material was exquisite, however. This was the first time I heard the segment about fat and metabolism and I found it hilarious. Furthermore, the Seigfried and Roy schtick was absolutely superb. Mason's perspective is always appreciated by those of us sickened by political correctness."
1,Smoke and Mirrors,"The authors start out with good intentions however they do not see them through to completion. For instance, the section in chapter 5 on hairpin filters refers you to parameter extraction techniques in chapter 8. Reading through chapter 8, nothing explicity refers you back to chapter 5. You are left on your own to figure out what in chapter 8 applies to chapter 5. Likewise with the section in chapter 5 regarding parallel coupled line filters. They refer you back to chapter 4, but chapter 4 does not explicity refer you back to chapter 5. The examples are incomplete at best and criminal at worst. The examples start out with adequate detail but then the usual academia smoke and mirrors trick is performed and voila you have the solution. Again the sections on hairpin and parallel coupled line filters (p130 and p128) show this.In summary this book is not worth your time or money."
5,Now this is more like it,Very happy with this purchase. It is SO much better than the yellow hard plastic one. The soft rubber protects the door edges much MUCH better.
1,Thieves,I ordered this product in January and it is now late april and I have yet to receive this item or my money back from the seller. When I ordered the product it said it was in stock. It is sellers like this that make people feel uneasy about shopping on the internet.
2,Good but Found a Better Bargain,"Bought two and installed them. Been using them for about 6 months now and they perform as advertised. However I needed another one for my other cars two doors and realized that I could make them myself out of swimming pool noodle floaty. Went to Walmart and bought one of those noodles the kids whack each other and float around the pool on for $1.68 and took my wife's electric knife and sliced that noodle in half from top to bottom, then sliced each long piece across the middle. I now had 4 door protectors and just used two 2.5"" roofing nails to nail them to the garage wall studs where the doors were hitting the wall and that worked every bit as well as the $10 each commercial ones I had bought."
4,Highland 9242300 Black Vehicle Door Protector,This product is good for me and my car as protect it when I open the door in my garage
4,Works as expected,It's high quality rubber. It has 4 holes on each corner for screws. I used to put dents in my garage drywall but not anymore. Works exactly as expected. Not 5 stars because it is on the expensive end.
4,Does its job,"Might need to get a couple of these to double the length to account for the area where you might have parked your car. Also, the mount holes in the top corners are thin and could be easily be pulled of the wall with screws staying in the wall. Bumpers are hollow with a web structure, works well for absorbing impact from doors."
4,protects door,Does exactly what you expect it would. Protects your car door from hitting the wall. Good idea. would be nice if it were a bit longer though in case you don't park in exactly the same spot every time.
5,Great product,Great product for protecting your car doors finish and garage wall door. Easy to install. Arrived quickly and as advertised!
3,Misinformed in Houston!,"I've been a big fan of PBW for a long time and I have found his technique to such amazement. Yet, when I purchased this album, some of the songs where from his previous album and where titled differently to throw you off. Futhermore, he has better songs with Charizma and there are none to be found on here. I wouldn't say that I am dissapointed by him, but maybe the label that compiled this album. I mean, who would know their own stuff better than Peanut Butter Wolf?"
3,"Worth it for ""Loving You"" Alone","I first heard ""Loving You,"" a reggae version of Minnie Ripperton's song, back in 1993, when a friend of mine bought a satellite dish, and was pulling in CSN -- the Caribbean Satellite Network.Alas, after that one brief showing -- and the unfortunate demise of CSN -- I never heard this song (or saw the video) again. Now, ten years later, I've found this CD single, and can happily add that particular song to my slowly growing reggae collection.As for the rest of the tracks, well ... let's just say the title of this review says it best.--gdw"
2,works but feel cheap,"this charger works but feels like really cheap plastic and the fuse inside of it burned out in 1 month, i would use it for emergency purposes only...."
5,"Works great, and price is for real!","I was not sure if the price it said was real, but it is. Works perfect, cord is not too long but it works for me and it's worth if for the price"
5,Ramsey at his best,I was very huge fan of Ramsey during the late 60's and 70's during the dance/disco era. One Voice is a truly a blessing.
5,"great ""extension"" usb cable!","I bought this as an extension cable to plug in my phone, as the cable that came with the phone is quite short. This cable does a great job! I had read that some cables don't work with their phones, that is why I opted for the gold-plated tips. It works like a charm for my LG Apex Android phone, charging it quickly and efficiently. I'll be buying more to extend cords to other items I have."
2,Some products don't completely match the descriptions (Caveat emptor),"I ordered a USB extension cable from UnitedIntegral through Amazon last week. It does not have gold-plated connectors as was indicated by the product title and it is not by Tripp Lite. It's a cheap generic Chinese USB cable.It will work, but it's not what completely was indicated by the product title.At the very least, Amazon needs to inform the buyer when a generic product which does not meet all of the specifically-described attributes named in the product description is substituted named and product. To do otherwise is deceptive advertising."
3,Good cable but it was the wrong type for my pc,This is a good cable but is for LOW SPEED transfers. I didn't know this and found I could use it. Please be sure of what you want before you buy. I needed a hi-speed cable and later got one. However it was cheap.
5,Works,"I didn't notice the ""false"" description so I'm not mad, HOWEVER, when I look at this thing sometimes it does appear to be gold plated, so maybe it is. I do know this, that despite some other review saying that these are cheap made in China cables (and u were expecting these to have been where else u racist bigot?), that unlike GOLD PLATED media link cable I bought, these don't have a toxic chemical smell that the medialink cable did, which gave me a headache and made me want to vomit as they constantly gassed off."
2,"Okay, but not up to date...","In a field as ""ever-changing"" as retirement plan management and pension administration, it takes a special set of resources to keep up with these changes. Dearborn is excellent, simply top notch with their securities and insurance publications; but with defined contribution and pension plans, unfortunately, their data is lacking, too basic, and out of date. Emphasis should be placed on compliance testing as well as the reform bills passed through congress affecting pension plans. I just don't feel this is covered here.If you want the creme de la creme of pension books, get Aspen Publishing's pension answer book series."
1,I received the wrong one!,"I ordered a white Accordion and received a blue one! By the time I realized it, I had thrown away the 2 boxes it came in!"
3,For Halloween,"Got this a month early for Halloween. Love the price, got to my house super quick. It's a 2 piece item, with the head cover and body suit.Word to the wise. I ordered size small. My kid is almost 5. The package is marked sized 5/6, ages 3-4. It fits my son exactly. I'm wondering if I am going to be able to fit a layer of pajamas underneath for warmth while trick or treating.So to everyone wondering what size to go with, the small is for 3-4 year olds, and the medium is next size up. I should have gone with med. but i didn't know. i will keep it. it is just for halloween and i think if he doesn't wear it until halloween then he should be able to wear Pj's with it without it ripping."
4,RUNS SMALL,"This is a great costume, but it runs really, really small. Our son is between 3T and 4T, so we ordered the toddler size first (the description said it fits through 4T) and it wasn't nearly big enough. More like a 2T. So we returned it and ordered the child's small, which says it's a size 4-6, and it fits perfectly. The actual packaging says ""size 4-6, for 3-4 years,"" so apparently whatever size chart they're going by is a little off. : It's a great-looking costume, but order a size larger than you think you need to."
4,My Nephew - The Flash!,"I bought this for my nephew that loves to dress up. That boy wears a costume until it falls to pieces, seriously. My sister will let him wear it anywhere he wants, it's quite a hoot!He loved this and it's held up pretty well. I did research the size very well before buying, so sizing wasn't an issue for me. They do run a bit samll.Pros:Good (pretty strong) fabricGood fit with adjustable waist tieFaux bootsAWESOME mask!Cons:Runs a bit on the small side, order up a size"
2,very cheap fabric,We've bought several super hero costumes in the last year for our 2 boys and they wear them all the time playing at home. The are usually not super great quality since we don't spend much on them but this one is terrible. The others have taken way more wear and are just falling apart. This one is falling apart at every seam after 2 wears...the sticking tread is too strong for the fabric I guess because it's shredding trough the fabric. It's too bad because they really are having fun being Flash.
1,"I don't know about Flash, but zoogster is the worst.","Zoogster should no longer be an Amazon retailer. Their customer service is non-existent. Bought this and another costume for Halloween, but more importantly, the school parties and parade the day before. They costumes didn't ship and didn't ship, I kept checking back and trying to email them and call them. The 800 number is totally bogus, busy at all times day and night. No response to repeated emails. Finally, the day before halloween, they shipped it overnight, without contacting me, though they knew that I could no longer use the costumes after the parties were over. They totally tried to snake it through before the buzzer, shipped it, and then when I returned it unopened, they charged me a restock fee, etc. Never contacted me, never responded. DO NOT BUY FROM ZOOGSTER. I repeat DO NOT BUY FROM ZOOGSTER!"
1,Cheaply made and instantly falling apart!!,"I really hate to be so negative, but this costume was not even worth my money. It was made very cheap and had frayed seams when we received it. By time my son wore it twice, it was a shreaded mess and the velcro that was to hold it together had almost all fallen off. I would have returned it for my money back initially, but my son was so excited to be ""The Flash""."
2,Charger works but not happy,I got this charger to keep my sansa charged while riding my Goldwing. When ever I plug the charger into the sansa and try to play music across the onboard aux input I get a terrible eletical noise. Unplug the charger and it goes away. The charger will charge the Sansa just not happy I can't charge and listen at the same time.
1,can't hear music while charging,I don't know how it charges because I can't play music and charge. All I can hear is a thump..thump..thump noise. Definitely useless unless you just want to charge your Sansa in the car.
2,Can't listen at the same time,"Bought for a great price. Plugged into Ford Focus and then into Sansa FUZE, but music stopped and only heard buzzing noise through speakers. Good for when you don't need to actually LISTEN to the music, but I would stick to charging it at home before you leave. Red indicator light on product, and batter-charge icon appears on mp3 player so you know when it's done charging. Emergency-only type of product here."
2,Broke my mp3 player,"I think it put out too much current, the mp3 player will no longer charge.I replaced my battery after using this cord and problem still occurred."
1,Can't even shoot them,"When my wife asked if I wanted to buy 5 crossbow bolts for $8 I thought ""wow! I won't find a better price anywhere!"". They just came in and after looking them over I can understand why they were so cheap. The tip and shaft are fine, but the fletchings and the nock look like they were assembled by someone who's never even seen a crossbow before. The fletchings are just slightly taller than normal crossbow fletchings, making the bolt sit funny in the rail. The worst part is the nock. The maker didn't even align them to the fletchings. this is kind of a safety hazard because in the best case they won't ever fly strait. worst case they jump off the string and go wherever the forces of chaos dictate. My advice: Instead of paying for 5 nearly worthless shafts, go ahead and spend your money on some well made, properly assembled bolts."
3,14 inch crossbow bolts,"For target practice these are fine. These bolts are made in China and are of that typical quality. After I got these I had to re-glue all the knocks and inserts before I could shoot them. I wont be upset if I lose or break a few.If you are going to hunt, find some better bolts.Going with three stars since they do fill a niche."
2,Not as I would have hoped,"These arrows are small and short, my original arrows that came with my crossbow were 16"" long, these are only 14. They shoot ok just not as good as the originals."
3,Crossbow bolts,"It was what I expected. The price was about right for the bolts, shipping was a bit high."
4,Looked fantastic!,"This banner looked even better than I expected! The colors are great and it was a great focal point over the main entry way. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cutouts were pretty knotted together when it arrived (took a little while to sort out, but really not too bad) and one of the hanging pieces kept falling off. We retied it repeatedly but it just wouldn't stay. This was probably just an issue with ours as the banner seemed to be really good quality. Overall I recommend it."
2,Cute but a little tricky to hang up,"Bought three strings of these for our daughter's birthday party. Make sure you know where they're going to hang or you might just be spending money needlessly. The facility we rented had high ceilings and we only had about 1/2 an hour set up time so these turned out to be kind of a waste of money -I put them by the front door per a friend's suggestion and they were kind of cute blowing in the wind. Once they were up they were kinda cute but to me I wish I hadn't bought them...just seemed unnecessary. On the upside, we had one left over and I'll just hang it in her room as a decoration.Oh and they're fragile. They will easily tear if the lanterns aren't opened correctly (as in, slowly and carefully), being that they're light cardboard and tissue paper."
4,nice touch,I have recently purchased this product for my daughters room and she loves it because it adds a nice feeling to the room.
3,Older Version Of Bugs,"I think there's some confusion going on because this tape is called ""Starring Bugs Bunny"", not ""Bugs Bunny Superstar"".It contains some of Bugs' episodes from his earlier years while he was still evolving.I don't like that earlier version of Bugs as well.But it might be interesting for people to see how the character evolved over time as the artistic genius of Chuck Jones and company arrived at the final incarnation of Bugs sometime in the 1950s I guess.Jeff Marzano"
3,fake out,"This flick has nothing to do with the backstory! Its actually an early 1980's Hong Kong box office failure called Police Sir, or Be This First. Chow is a young cop who makes a lot of mistakes. Low-brow"
2,Buyer Beware!,"First I'll say that Chow is a fine actor with great screen presence, and if you're looking for what you get in movies like Crouching Tiger or Hardboiled - Forget it!! The box and title for ""Hard Boiled Killers"" are totally misleading. This is an older movie with poor production value and with painfully small subtitles! The other viewers didn't say enough! This movie is a 'light' hearted comedy; Chow comes off very much like Jackie Chan (I was stunned- he did it very well), but there is only moderate gunplay. If you're a CYF diehard, go on and buy it, otherwise rent it (if you're desperate) and you'll see why we took time to write this. Fortunatly, the man went on to do much much better work. This movie is not terrible, but almost. [It'd be nice if the cover were more honest too] ciao!?"
1,Decieving!,"Man, I was so pumped to see this movie, I'm a huge Chow Yun Fat fan. I see the cover, looked cool, the back plot description sounded promising. I pop the tape in, and what do I see? A horrible light hearted comedy, with crappy subtitles.I review this from a fan perspective of Yun Fat's work with John Woo, as well as his more dramatic roles, but don't be decieved by the box. I read somewhere that Yun Fat has countless,nameless generic Hong Kong films that he worked on when he was younger. Don't buy this unless your a fan of cheesy poorly subtitled light hearted Hong Kong comedies from the early 80's. Oh yeah shouldn't there be a law against false movie advertisment."
2,Very Disheartened.,"I could not believe what I was seeing. However, since I am trying to collect all the movies of Mr. Chow, I will have to keep this for my collection. His acting in the movie was rather weak and did not depict any of his acting ability. Oh well, live and learn, right?"
3,Be Aware,"IF you are going to buy this movie, be aware that the cover has nothing to do with the movie. Yet if you are just going to buy it for collecter's sake I'd say you should buy it for entertainment."
2,Mostly a book of patterns,"If you are looking for an inexpensive book of just patterns, this will meet your needs. However the carving instructions are minimalist and there are no painting instructions. There is one color picture of each bird included."
5,Desert Resource,"For anyone who has heard of Zabriskie Point, but was afraid to ask. Though written by a hiker for hikers, this book is an indispensable resource of history, geology, archaeology, flora and fauna for this unique region. It will take you far beyond the trails."
5,plain common sense,"If the US policymakers listened to Ralph Peters, the world would be a better, safer place."
1,"Simplistic, Jingoistic, and Antagonistic","If you believe in the USA uber alles, by all means read this book because Peters will confirm your worst fears about a multilateral foreign policy. If you don't, don't bother. From his author bio: ""Ralph Peters maintains strict independence from all partisan organizations and finds the sight of burning bridges inspiring."" Well, these aren't just figurative bridges Peters wants to burn--if you're a country in the middle East with a river to cross you'd better watch out, because Peters is coming your way soon."
1,The Hatemonger speaks,"Mr. Peters is a rabid conservative partisan and known hatemonger who engages in peronsal insults. He is a disgrace to his country, and to the Miltary."
5,The best analysis of the war on terror to date,"Ralph Peters is probably the most insightful strategic thinker in the United States today. His collection of essays ""Beyond Baghdad"" should be required reading for every decision maker in government or the military. I can attest from personal participation in both Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM that his observations are accurate and illuminating. The state of affairs he describes in Baghdad and Iraq in general is much closer to the truth than anything you will see in the mainstream media. If you read only one book about the current war in Iraq. Read ""Beyond Baghdad"""
2,almost good,"i've read good things about alpen products, so when i saw the spotting scope, i figured it was worth a try. at 15x it is as good as i expected. BUT when i turn up the power, the resolution is not clear. i would only buy an alpen in the future if i could check out the specific unit to be purchased.i live in elk/deer/antelope country and planned on using the higher power to view these critters. my 12x42 binoculars (nikon) work better with less eye strain."
3,Pretty and delicate but small,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. The detail on this piece is very beautiful and delicate, but it is also small in size. As a result, you have to be very close to see its beauty. It seemed bigger in the picture."
3,Better than I expected it to be,Gift for my husband who saw preview trailers and thought it looked hilarious! (I thought it would be pretty silly but I was surprised I actually enjoyed watching it!) I wouldn't call it a horror movie. I think a dark comedy is a better category! We had some good laughs. :-)
4,Ewe should see this!,"If you love black comedy and horror films, you'll probably love Black Sheep. My sister bought this for me for X-mas this year and I watched it that night. I was expecting a pretty stupid movie but what I got was a lot of really good, gory sfx (courtesy of the team at Peter Jackson's WETA digital) and many laughs. This is a B-film without the B-film feel. The acting is great as well.Picture rabid, genetically mutated sheep tearing through the countryside of New Zealand, turning everything in their wake into more bloodthirsty sheep! If you've ever been accosted by hungry sheep at a petting zoo, you already appreciate how ""vicious"" sheep can be. Now, go enjoy this gem!"
4,Not Baaaaad!,"My lovely wife Beth bought me this and FIDO for my birthday. God, I love that woman! Anyhow...""Black Sheep"" is hard to fit into a horror sub-category. In a way, it's a wolf-man movie, but with sheep. In another way, it's bio-horror. And then again, it's more like a zombie film.The difference between this and, say, ""Killer Shrews"" is the quality backdrop story. The characters are three-dimensional and their interactions move the story along.The special effects are decent. Some of the gore is downright disgusting. Cool!""Black Sheep"" is definitely worth your time and money."
3,wonderfully bad,"Horrible cliches, tired stereotypes and bad science abound in this amusing New Zealand film. If you have ever been around sheep, you will laugh and roll your eyes, if not you may scratch your head and groan. Not appropriate for younger viewers."
4,HIDE THE SHEEP,"IF YOU ARE A FAN OF AUSSIE HORROR ( WHICH TENDS TO BE SPOTTY AT TIMES FROM GOOD ""DEAD ALIVE "" TO TERRIBLE ""UNDEAD "" )HERES A REALLY CLEVER TALE .TYPICAL OF NATURE GONE MAD FILMS LIKE ""FROGS"" OR ""FOOD OF THE GODS"" THIS ONE REVOLVES AROUND A FAMILY / CORPORATION WHICH GENETICALLY TRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR SHEEP FARMING WITH DISASTEROUS RESULTS .THE TRULY INSPIRED IDEA THAT SWEET LITTLE SHEEP CAN BE A THREAT DOESNT WEAR THIN IN EITHER THE LAUGHS OR THE GORE . THIS FILM SIMPLY IS FUN . THE LAUGHS ARE SELF SERVING AND SILLY SURE BUT IN AN EVIL DEAD 2 KINDA WAY .BELIEVE ME IM NOT A BIG FAN OF HORROR PLAYED FOR LAUGHS (ITS WAY OVERDONE AND OFFENSIVE TO REAL HORROR FANS ) BUT THIS FILM REALLY IS SO OVER THE TOP ITS JUST WORKS .BY THE TIME THE HERO QUAKES WITH TERROR AT THE SIGHT OF HUNDREDS OF SHEEP COMING OVER A HILL THE ABSURDITY AND HILARITY WILL SURELY OVERCOME YOU AS IT DID ME .WELL WORTH A LOOK AND FOR THE COLLECTOR HORROR FAN A FINE ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION .A WINNER ."
3,HOOOOOWWWLLL WERE-SHEEP OF NEW ZEALAND! 3 1/2 STARS,"OK, I just couldn't resist seeing this strange looking film! I watched this film with my wife and we both found it very entertaining. The funny thing is....it could have been played completely straight and worked! Sheep are freaky looking critters and I found myself a little creep-ed out, looking at them up close! This is a very dark comedy/horror film all the way and they pull it off. With a 85 minute running length the film ends before the jokes get old. Very good FX and some gratuitous gore for my gore-hound buddies keep this film from becoming too silly. The film does have some very good scares too, so If your looking for something different maybe 'Black Sheep' is just your Baaaaagggg! ;-b"
4,surprisingly good production values,"So this is exactly what you'd expect a New Zealander horror B-movie about killer sheep to be -- tongue-in-cheek mixed with gore.What is most surprising about this film are probably the unusually high production values, far in excess of what you expect from your average horror B-movie. The acting is good, the cinematography excellent (perhaps they had all the extra film stock and out-of-work production staff from Peter Jackson's movies to tap into), the FX high in quality (from Weta, so that's not a surprise), and the direction and editing spot on -- capturing the comedic timing just right (timing is the heart of comedy) while not detracting from what horror you can squeeze out of the premise.All in all, it looks as if it had five to 10 times the budget of your average B-movie. And it's good, killer sheep fun to boot -- they never miss any of the jokes that you'd expect."
4,Crazy Movie,"This movie is nuts. Kind of funny, kind of disgusting. If you watched the trailer and it made you want to see the film, you will probably enjoy it."
4,Freedom of Anarchy,"A movie alarms at consequences a mix of unregulated scientific gene engineering with a green activism might present.Laughing while watching sadistic murdering and mutilations is, perhaps, a modern trend in cinematography not in New Zealand only."
4,not for the serious at heart,"look, if you go into this movie expecting anything other than cheesy hylarity you will not enjoy it. it's not a horror movie, it's a funny movie. the fact is this movie is great to sit aorund with your friends and have a good laugh. admittedly not for everybody and npot nescicarily something you want to own so i'd recomend renting it first, this is movie that if you like it you'll know and you'll watch it again with some your buddies."
1,Cornball Rubbish,I was really disappointed with this film. The trailer looked great and the whole evil sheep premise look hilarious. However the sheep gags are on the whole lifeless and uninspired and lack any real wit. The acting is awful and the gore nothing special. I usually love B grade movies but this film just wasn't entertaining at all.
1,God Awful!!!!,"This is one of those movies that causes you physical pain to sit through! But, you have to force yourself to sit through it because, darnit, you spent all that money on it! It was cheesey, stupid, lame, boring, and just plain ridiculous! I love horror movies, but I hated this."
4,I ALMOST BARFED MY BRAINS OUT!!!,I have been waiting for the release of this movie for quite a while. I ran out to buy it the moment it released. It definitely is a dark humor film. I sat down to relax and watch the movie with a Bloody Mary in my hand. I quickly had to dump the drink down the drain after the first couple of grotesque scenes of bloody intestines. I really did enjoy this flick and it fed my hunger for a horror/comedy.
4,Unique take on an old premise,"This is a pitch black horror comedy with special effects by Peter Jackson's company. And it concerns sheep. That's right, mutated, ravenous, lycanthropic sheep roaming the New Zealand countryside for victims. When one of the wooly buggers bites you, as befitting the legend of such a creature, you transform into a sheep yourself. In fact, one of the characters in transition tells a group of people "" I'll be baaaaa-ck."" Okay, if you can get past the ridiculous premise of this movie, you are going to have a lot of fun. To the actors' credit, they make you care about their characters amidst all the wool bearing. There are some sly visual gags and enough gore to satisfy the wolf in sheeps clothing. In all, a little sleeper with originality and tongue in cheek, on it's way to becoming a cult classic."
4,A Gory and Funny BAAAAAD Horror Movie,"Before I start, I'll just say this is a bad movie. The plot is substandard and the acting is poor. However, the camp-ness of the movie is funny, the effects are good, and the gore is spectacular. If you're the sort of person who laughs at bad horror movies on TV, this movie is definitely for you, just don't expect to be scared."
4,FUN,"This movie is fun to watch. VERY cheesy, which is why we like it! Every time I see a sheep, I laugh and think of the scene when the sheep is behind the steering wheel of the truck going over the cliff!"
3,Sheeping entertaining....baa baa,"Ok, so it does'nt have a billion dollar budget, but the scenery is sure worthit. Filmed in the great outdoors, we get the scenery, the sheeps, the madscientist type, put them all in a bag and shake like crazy. Out come a moviewith mutated sheeps, people changing into sheep-monsters ...lots of blood andwe get Black Sheep. I had fun watching this movie and is good for multiple views.enjoy."
2,So-So,"You start the movie, wait for the good attack scenes, and wait and wait and wait. The movie was actually kinda slow. The only good ""sheep attack"" scene was at the end of the movie. Overall, I wouldn't watch it again..."
5,Unknown Actors Star In One Of The Best Horror/Comedies Of 2006,"Nathan Meister, Danielle Mason, Tammy Davis, Peter Feeney, Oliver Driver and Glenis Levestam star in this horror comedy from writer/director; Jonathan King. I thought the movie was going to be scary but I was a million miles off. In fact, it is one of my favorite movies of recent years. This movie was great along with POULTRYGEIST, HATCHET and SLITHER, also made in 2006. I give the movie a 5 out of 5 rating."
3,Fun Bloody Romp,"Well, I was destined to be let down somewhat as the expectations were set rather high after seeing the outrageously fantastic trailer.Still, tis a film that delivers on the entertainment aspect. Completely absurd, predictable in its weaving of obvious PETA-esque messages, but it does deliver the gore and has an acceptable story line. If you like your horror with a bit of cheekiness thrown in ala Leprachaun, Dead Alive, or even Child's Play, then this shall not disappoint."
1,Collapsed to flat and tiny within a week.,"I wanted a nice big puffy pillow life the ones in hotels. This one *looked* right, but its appearance was deceptive. There's just tons of air in this pillow. At first, my head sunk down in it and it poofed up around the sides like a pool toy. I would wake up in the middle of the night with my head and face sweating - it just sunk in the middle and wrapped around me on the sides. After about a week, the extra air that had been pumped into the thing escaped. Now, I just have a very small, flat pillow."
3,"great bottle, no cage","Great bottle. No cage. The seller said it was mistakenly added to the description, but I still haven't been refunded for it."
5,Great bottle - get rid of leaching plastic,"This is a great product. The 27oz., a perfect carrying size, with the screw-on cap makes water taste clean and delicious. This cap does squeak a little when you tighten it, but it's a small price to pay for a sealed fit that doesn't leak.Other comments about noise and leakage really pertain to the sports cap, which I don't recommend."
4,I like it..,"I like the Klean Kanteen, but it does have its downsides. I don't know if it's just me, but it often has a metallic smell. I don't really like the smell of it too much so I pour it into a cup...but still, the metallic smell kinda sucks. Other than that, it's a great water bottle."
5,I love these safe containers!,My fussy husband & I drink as much water as possible & these containers make it so safe! Water taste pure & untainted & we leave our Hetch Hetchy Cailfornia water in our containers all day & all night. Way better than any plastic containers!!!
4,Concise and cheap!,"This book was required for Soil Biology at Oregon State University. Our professor decided to change to this book from ""Principles and Applications of Soil Microbiology"" (by David M. Sylvia) because students liked how small and cheap it is. It fits well in my purse, actually. I've brought my book to many places to read, and the chapters are concise and well written. Compared to the Sylvia book (which is around $140ish and rather unwieldy), the topics aren't as numerous or fleshed out, but you get what you pay for. However, I don't recommend purchasing this book unless you need it for a class. It's not worth it as a good reference to have on hand. You would have to scour the chapters for the information you want, and it's not even guaranteed to be there. So, good for classes, bad for references afterwards."
4,Love it!!!!,It's a great brown and fits it pretty snug. It's extremely cushiony on the back and it makes me feel like my ipad is super secure. It doesn't turn on and off when it closes and opens but it's so worth it for this price. Extremely well made and I received it fast. Get this product!
3,NOT like pictured,"Good case, quality made. However the color is WAY off. Classic Brown? That depends on your perception but it clearly is not like the color pictured on this page. It's more of a... well... dull brown. Not that, that will help you (unless I call it poo brown which is quite accurate).Other than the misleading color in the picture it's a great case but I don't know if I can put these on our Retail Store employee ipads for that reason."
4,Love them!,"Only negative thing I have to say is that when I washed them before use, water gets between the steel and acrylic which takes a long time to dry. Otherwise, they are great."
3,Misleading description...,"Although the set looks beautiful with my stainless steel appliances, I am disappointed for two reasons: the description says ""glass see-through""...it is not glass, but acrylic. Also, the lids do not fit tight at all...have a skinny little seal that really does nothing to keep the lid on (and bugs out!). So, if those two things aren't important to you...BUY IT!"
3,butterbur,seems to be helping somewhat with the frequency and severity of my migraines. But the pills smell awful and make sure you either take them at night or with food...bad taste if you should burp.
1,Brown spots,"I was so put off by the brown spots in the capsules I called customer service. They said lots of people call and the brown spots were OK. Maybe they are, but I've never seen them in any other brands of this product. I'm buying other brands now."
3,Waiting for significant results,"I have only been using this product for a few weeks, so I am not sure at this time as to whether or not it is making a significant difference. My experience with ordering and obtaining this product was easy."
1,Didn't help migraines,"I used this product for about a month to help with my severe, and frequent migraines. There was no improvement at all, and so I quit taking it."
3,Not as good as volume 1,"Ito and Makoto's romance continues in this volume, this time hampered by Makoto's arranged fiance the girl Takayo, and her weird brother Takashi.I found myself less interested in this volume, as it felt a bit farfetched what with Takashi's bodyguards running around highschool trying to sabotage Ito and Makoto's romance, plus I don't much care for Takashi and his strange relationship with his sister. Perhaps this volume may be more suited to a younger age group than me, although some of the themes are surprisingly mature.Still, Ito and Makoto do perform in Swan lake and there is some angst when Ito and Makoto do fight and seperate for a time."
2,France and the French sans Passion,"I have been looking for a book on modern French history for some time having exhausted the available single topic English language histories such as ""A Savage War of Peace"" (Algeria), ""The Fall of the Third Republic"" (1940) and ""The Last Valley"" (Indochina). Sadly, I am still looking. This is the driest tome that could possibly be penned on the subject. It is beautifully organized and I prize it as a refence book but I cannot just sit down with this title and enjoy myself."
1,Has Sucralose!!!,"This is suppose to be a ""healthy"" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients."
2,Taste old... not like store bought,"I love Ostrim Natural Flavor and used to buy it at local deli and/or GNC, decided to buy on amazon to save money. But this one taste dry and old, like its past its expiration date or something. I was looking for the expiration date on the box and found none"
1,"Proto Foods - Ostrim Natural Flavor Snack, 10 packs","Not good, product was old and nearly passed due, poor quality and taste when compared to a fresh product. The product seemed dry and the taste was inconsistent with previously purchased, fresher products."
1,CAN'T COUNT,"I did order two of these items, but they only shipped one...bad business, why must fight for something that I did paid for in good faith"
1,Usually very good but this batch was rotten,I had to throw them out they were gross. Usually they are a very tasty snack. Not to mention a healthy snack.
3,Fun stories,"I bought this book to read aloud. Unfortunately, many of the stories are very dated. But there are a few good ones."
2,Disappointment,"I loved this book when I was a teenager but my copy disappeared somewhere along the line so I was excited to see that I could get another copy. I was very disappointed that the book arrived without the cover. I guess it's understandable, but the cover displays some of the giants of the genre."
2,La Chat w/o 3 6 mafia,"I am a huge fan of La Chat and her album ""Murder She She Spoke"" but this album is really boring and too underground. Without 3 6 mafia, the beats on this cd are terrible. The only good track on this cd is ""You Ain't Crunk Enough."" Overall I was really disappointed by this cd."
4,"3-6's Other Leading Lady, Flying Solo!","I never thought La'Chat would ever be heard from again. There was a rumor going around my area that she was dead. But low and behold, the joy I felt when I discovered she was back! Although her sophmore album ""Ultimate Revenge"" isn't as wonderful as her debut (""Murder She Spoke""), Chat still shows that she is hard as she wants to be. The beats are tight and I think she's grown lyrically, and she is starting to rap at a more uptempo pace. The material is unique, and she definitly shows she can hold her own. The only reason I didn't give this album five stars is because I don't like the front cover (Her face is hidden behind sunglasses and bandanas.), and because the track list is not in exact playing order. Other than that, it's bumpin'. Keep shining, Chat!"
3,Ultimate Revenge- La Chat,"this is most likely going to be la chats last record. her first one was more on point, this one featuring a whole bunch of unknowns throughout the album. however some songs are real tight"
1,WORST CD EVER!!!,"I mean, just look at the album art!!! LOLOLOLHAHAHA!!!IT SUCKS!!!WTF were they thinking!"
1,La Chat is stupid,this album is cheesier than the coverHCP droppin La Chat was the best thing they ever did...GANGSTA BOO >>> LA CHAT*thumbs down* to La Chatplease retire
5,Very Good Cooking Book !,"I wished the book had more recipes came had other languages available. My mother-in-law would like to have one for her kitchen, but she does not understand English."
3,Unclear instructions,"I usually ""test"" any recipe book I bought by trying one of its recipes that I have not cooked or eaten before. In this way, I will not have any pre-conceived ideas of the dish. I picked the Yunan Chicken as it looked simple enough. However, even for a frequent cook which I am, I soon found the instructions unclear. For example, it was not clear whether the dates, spring onions and dong qui should be placed below or on top of the chicken. Also, I feel that the 1 litre of water to be added should be listed in the ingredients rather than hidden in the insrtuctions. The end state is also ambiguous as I do not know whether it was a soup, a stew or something else."
4,Yummy!,"This is a great cookbook from a great restaurant. I haven't tried all the recipes yet, but those I have are great and not too difficult to follow. The egg recipes - eggs benedict, and more unusual creations - are excellent. Also noteworthy are the drink recipes - because you can't have a good New Orleans meal without a drink, right? :) If you want to cook rich, delicious food, this is a great cookbook. Of course, better still, be sure to visit Brennan's when you're in New Orleans."
3,A FAIRLY ENGAGING 1938 COMEDY.,"Dunne plays a very successful radio show star who earns half a mill a year. Her family are a bunch of lazy ne'er-do-wells who leech off her earnings and her income tax problems are astronomical. After Fairbanks is arrested for being a ""masher"" among the mob of Dunne's adoring fans, Dunne is, rather absurdly, appointed as Fairbank's parole officer, a plot twist which gives the duo a chance to meet in watering holes, get drunk and fall in love...With several tunes by Jerome Kern, one would expect that this rather forced little comedy would have more classy attributes. The picture was expensive to shoot, and it shows; it lost a fortune at the box-office. Even the comedic talents of Pangborn, Kibbee, Gilbert, Blore, and, in a very short bit - Lucille Ball - fail to raise the level of slapstick. Disappointingly flat and ludicrously corny. The original title of this film was to be THE JOY OF LOVING, but the censors of 1938 made it clear that there should be no joy in loving!"
4,Thourogh book on the making of Fantasia 2000,"This was a beautiful book. Interpolated with pictures from the new Disney film it is for any fan of the new film. I did enjoy his other book on the Fantasia more. This though in detail on each of the ssegments individually there is not enough info on the overall creative process. I thimk this book belongs first for any Fantasia 2000 fan, secod for any Disney fan, and and a distant third for anyone who enjoys reading about the making of movies."
3,Okay,Not the best quality. Skipped and froze in my DVD player. What I did or could watch had general information.
3,Odd mix of memoir and musings,"I read this book for my book club. As a book club book it was pretty successful. We didn't talk all that much about the book itself but the book prompting some wonderful discussion about food and memories and the like.For the reader without a discussion to look forward to, I'd be reluctant to recommend the book. Something is missing for me about this read. I've given it three stars because the actual writing (particularly some of the food descriptions) is quite strong. But the content is lacking. I'm all for memoirs of interesting people but I really learned far more about Moore's relatively ordinary life than I ever wanted to know. Then, just to confuse things, are some pretty random essays about food totally outside of the context of the memoir. It just doesn't work for what I want out of a read in this type of a book."
2,Not as good as Fat Girl,"Bought this book after reading Fat Girl by the same author. This book is not as good in my view because it is really a loose collection of personal essays , supposedly around a food theme, but not all of them are about this theme. Some essays just don't belong. This makes me annoyed as I wonder if it's one of those things where the publisher says we need more stuff to fill up the book so they threw in random essays. Fat Girl, in contrast, is a short, sharp, focused book that gets its point across. I couldn't finish reading this one."
3,New Use for Tide to Go,"While traveling in Europe this summer, my daughter got some mosquito bites as we walked through Rome. They itched so much, so I looked in my purse to see if I had anything to help - but found nothing except my Tide To Go Pen. So I told her to try it - who knows? Sure enough, the itching stopped. We've tried it several times since then with different people and they all had good success with it. Try it yourself sometime - you never know!"
2,Not even half as good as Shout Wipe & Go,Used to be able to pick up a 4 pack of Shout Wipe & Go at the local Walmart for $1.00. Bought the Tide Stain Remover only because no Shout's Wipe & Go was in stock. Big mistake.Tide is NOWHERE near as effective as Shout. Wouldn't waste my money on Tide a 2nd time.Just bought 5 12-packs of Shout's Wipe & Go here on Amazon. I will never let myself run out again. I keep some in my purse ALL the time. Use it immediately on any spills and have saved not just my and my husband's wardrobe more than once but all the grandkids too. The great thing is Shout removes the stain immediately and dries without a water stain. Your clothes look like new upon treatment!
2,Do not buy,"I bought this hopin to remove some pen stains out of my pants, however it only made it fade a little rather than get rid of it do my suggestion is only use it on fresh stains otherwise do not buy!"
5,Saved My Band Shirt!,"This got RED slushie out of a brand new white t-shirt. I had just gotten it at a concert, and it was horrendously overpriced and I thought I'd ruined it forever, but there aren't even traces of the pink stain left on the shirt. This really saved me here.Haven't tried it on anything else yet, but you can bet that I will."
3,Multi strip Handles,"[...]Lifetime resistance bands with handles that can hold three bands at once! Cool now I'll order a 4,6,8,10 which will allow me to have 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22 and 24, that should do the trick.I haven't gotten them yet. What I don't like about resistance bands is the fact that I have to do a half curl extended to 90 and the other half curl 90 to flexed in order to have some resistence on the extended to 90 range, but as has been noted, you can't pack your dumb bells"
4,"Excellent, but not abrasion-proof","Tubing is very sturdy and holds up to heavy use, with one exception: I was using tubing for a cable-row-type exercise, with the tubing wrapped around a square post. The post's edges were not sharp, but the abrasion under heavy resistance was enough to cause tearing in the tube. Also, the hard handles with plastic rings are a mixed bag - they are great, because the rings rotate freely around the handle, even under the heaviest resistance, but the hard handles can bump up against your hands, making certain exercises, such as curls, slightly awkward.NOTE: Almost exactly three years after buying these bands, they finally failed. I've been using them 1-3x/week for three years, and today, while doing a standing shoulder press, the band snapped inside the handle, just below the ""nut"" that keeps it in the handle. I'm going to get another one."
1,So disappointing!!!!,I did not get the product in the picture!! This was in no way the item that I expected and I'm sorry that I got it!!
1,Seriously?,"I was just looking for a really precise, useful tweezer. I read a bunch of reviews of here, boasting these as ""THE BEST"" -- I got them on sale for $0.99, so I'm hardly upset (and I don't know what I was thinking at a price like that), but these are just generic crap tweezers. They don't work any better or any worse than the ones you can buy for $2 on the shelf at any drugstore. So I'm not sure what the hype is about."
5,"Nice Shaper, Wrong Specs","This model actually has a 5HP, 3 phase motor. Model 1791273 is the Powermatic Shaper with the 3 HP single phase motor.You will also need to be prepared with a forklift to receive the Shaper. The shaper comes in a single box that weighs over 500 pounds, and shipping companies do not help with off-loading the shaper from the truck unless you go to their terminal with your own transportation.As long as you have 3 phase power and a way to unload the shaper, you will be very happy with this tool."
4,Current readings in viral oncogenesis,"This is a useful reference for those interested in viral oncogenesis as well as other topics such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. Each chapter also serves as a springboard for continued research on a subject because each is so well referenced. This is a good addition to any upper level undergraduate or graduate student's library who may want more specific information than what is found in a typical textbook but who can't or won't acquire a larger, more expensive virology reference"
1,Trotskyite Dogma,"Don't expect a reasoned, or scholarly, study of Walter Reuther. This is just a political screed from the Socialist Workers Party."
2,Thought it would be like momma used to make.,"I really thought that this product would be like momma used to make. But without the body of a real potato, these just don't cut the mustard. Manischewitz is my brand of choice, but these left me flat. No body, texture was not appealing. Will not buy again. Back to scratch."
3,Pleasant Surprise,I thought these would taste different then what they did taste like. The funny thing is my husband loves to make these to go along with his dinners that he prepares. The family loves the savory way in which he makes them.
2,Mildly amusing,"Book had humorous parts, but my reading time is precious to me, and this was a waste of time in that sense."
3,chick lit with a little WHINE,Four friends gather monthly and chat about their lives and basically moan about how they miss their 'babehood' before marriage and children. I found the story boring as it went back and forth to each mother and their married stories. It was a whine-fest and I was happy when the book was over.
2,Disappointed,"This book has a great cover, but don't judge the book by it. I like all kinds of chick lit--it doesn't have to be funny--but if it's not funny, it should at least be very well written with characters that captivate you. This book doesn't deliver on any of these counts. I found the characters hard to identify with and the plot predictable."
4,Great book-Easy and fast to read!,I really enjoyed this book. It is light and funny. The characters were easy to envision as my own friends and myself. I would recommend it to others and hope that they enjoy it as much as I did.
2,Brutish Debunking of Loch Ness Enigma,"As a collector, and reader of books upon the Loch Ness Monster, this book is not one which I would recommend to readers with little or no knowledge of the subject. The author is highly skeptical of the existence of any such creature and debunks all available evidence. This is all well and good, however,in this reviewers opinion, he does on occasions dismiss too much information. Despite these objections, some of the authors criticism of evidence is quite properly and correctly deduced. But be warned, if you are looking for something to arbitarily explain the case facts, then this is not the volume for you. It is though, still a good read and a useful work to own to discover both sides of the argument."
2,Too Many Factual Errors,"Campbell does make several good points in this book, but this book is REPLETE with incredibly shoddy factual errors and is so flatly written that at times it sounds like the instructions for assembling an airplane model.An interesting chapter on Robert Rines's underwater photos and several good points the author makes along the way saved this book from a 1-star rating."
4,Quick Release,"A modification to the tip of cymbal holder was required to get cymbal to fit, once this was done ""these things work great"". Tear down takes much less time...great product."
4,Great except for 1 thing,"This box set is great except on disc 2 when it gets to the episodes: ""Isn't that What'sHerFace"", ""A Date From Heck."", & ""U.F. OH NO!"" it just shows the theme song, so I have to go to the episode guide in order to watch the episode."
2,Photo copied manual,Basically someone photo copied a assembly manual. If you can find an original manual pay the extra money. Unless you've been around Chevys are your life like me you won't find these too helpful. Even with all the years of experience I was confused because of the poor quality of the copied material.
3,Its Okay,"This is a good book. However, it did not meet my need. I had a specific case of looking for parenting tips on helping a young child who has lost his mother from cancer rather quickly."
2,tough to read and tougher to enjoy,"very dated indeed-although militantly feminist at times she is also surprisingly racist with comments such as all chinese look alike..seemingly written in a matter of fact way. (this was written 35 years ago and does not stand up well)have a dictionary handy unless you are up on every eleven-dollar word in the language; i am fairly well-read but found myself slowing down to try to figure out what the hell a word meant in order to grasp a sentence...a much more entertaining and extremely knowledgeable writer on this topic is jeanine basinger...her books on women in film and the star machine are excellent and fun to read...this book is a chore to read, but all i have at the moment, or i probably would not finish it..."
1,Absolutely Awful and Totally Dated,"This is one of the least enjoyable books on films you will ever come across. Totally dry and bland, Haskell just runs through women's history in motion pictures with thumbnail descriptions of classic films and the like, never really giving us the essence of any major female stars or even good analysis on specific films. Don't take my word for it - check it out at the library and read it for yourself. Bet you don't finish it!!"
3,Fine effort,"Her voice has a fine one tone and technically he's good at phrasing but not exactly Sassy,Ella,or Billie. but then again whose is.I can see why Blue Note put her on roster instead of a lesser label.She delivers goods (and at prices here now it's like your just paying shipping).Definitely worth while but I don't think Dianne Reeves needs to nervous right now.Still there are so many sub- standard female singers signed (and like no decent new male ones) that it's worth getting here BN efforts and watching if she catches on.Chazz"
4,Basic Tripod,"I purchased this tripod along with a David White transit with an optical plummet and a CST/Berger grade rod. I have worked in the construction industry for over 40 years and this was for my personal use in the surveying and site layout of my retirement home. I am not an expert surveyor but have used and know the basics of my intended use. This is a good product, well made and very reasonably priced. I would suggest that when researching the transit on Amazon it was suggested that a dome head tripod was appropriate for the optical plummet transit; I disagree as the flat top works better for pluming over a reference stake. The domed head is more appropriate for self leveling instruments. My best reference is that Amazon had the best price for all three of the products and the shipping was as always very efficient."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"I just got back from Spain, and this guide was amazing. I highly recommend you check out their picks for top restaurants, I think they were very well chosen.The maps were excellent, and very helpful. This is the guide to take to Barcelona!"
3,Not what it seems!,"I drove from Dallas to Houston to get a Bumble Bag since it was the closest store. I was so excited to get one after I fell in love with them online. I SURE AM GLAD I DID! When I got there, the fabric was beautiful and it seemed very sturdy. The problem was, they were REALLY small.I am pregnant with our 5 baby and so I KNOW what I need room for in a diaper bag. There is NO way you would be able to fit a change of clothes, diapers, bottles and wipes in there together. Let alone room for things that mom needs, if you are like me and put your wallet and things like that in there. I was SO disappointed.I looked online at their website and they have made a bigger bag called the Natalie but Im unsure when it is to come out.Like the other reviewer said, look around before you buy ESPECIALLY at their prices."
4,Great bag!,"This is a great bag, nice fabric, great colors. I like that I can use it as a backpack or messenger bag."
3,Review from the Synthesis,"Last ditch effort; gimmicky reunion album; too little too late. These are all phrases commonly used to describe this type of release. While TFF hasn't recorded together since 1989 with their platinum album, The Seeds of Love, I would hesitate to slap this album with any of the above labels. You might be skeptical as to the motive behind this release - so was I. It seems a little too coincidental that artists like New Order, Billy Idol and Tears For Fears happen to wake from over a decade of sleep right in the middle of an all-out `80s revival, but I must say that Everybody Loves a Happy Ending is a solid album from a maturing band that isn't stuck in their golden years.- Chris AcostaSynthesis.net"
5,Excellent Come Back!,"I have always been a fan of Tears for Fears since the 1980's. They have always sang songs about the real world and had a soulful sound. In the 1980's, songs like ""Shout"", ""Everybody Wants to Rule The World"", ""Head Over Heels"" and others made big hits. Now in the 2000's, they have come back with smooth sounds including, ""Secret World"", ""The Last Days on Earth"", ""The Closest Thing To Heaven"" and many more great songs. I am happy that I purchased the CD and for anyone that is a Tears For Fears Fan; you will enjoy the new easy mellow sounds of, ""Everybody Loves A Happy Ending."""
5,Everybody loves a great album!,"This is the album that Tears For Fears fans have waited on for 14 years, and to this reviewer it was well worth it. The new music pays homage to the Beatles while retaining the classic Tears For Fears sound, and it seems to convey an overall sense of contentment instead of torment, which was thematic in past Tears For Fears albums. Hardcore fans may be turned off by it for that reason, but I for one am glad to see that Roland and Curt are at such a point in their lives. ""Everybody Loves A Happy Ending"" is original, mature, and well-crafted. Highlights include the title track, ""Closest Thing To Heaven"", ""Call Me Mellow"", ""Secret World"", and ""Ladybird""."
5,excellent return,"After a long hiatus, Tears For Fears is back with, in my opinion, the best release of their career. ""Everybody Loves..."" brings Tears For Fears full-circle back to their Beatles-influenced roots. More guitar-driven than their earlier efforts, the album shows off a maturity in musicianship and songwriting that will keep you hooked ""spin after spin.""This album was a huge surprise. Most 80's bands that have recently released new projects to try and return to the spotlight have come up very short. However, Tears For Fears proves that they have never lost their touch. In short, this is probably one of the best pop-rock albums to be released in 2004."
1,Not everyone.,"TFF haven't done anything worth listening to in over 20 years. Come on, you know I'm right. Even Fish For Life was better than anything post-SFTBC. The Hurting was superb. SFTBC was good, albeit overplayed at the time. But ever since? Please. They've been grasping, struggling to re-live the past. It isn't going to happen. Even with Curt back in the fold. There comes a time in many an artists' career when an objective truth must be spoken. Guys, let me be the one: It's Over."
2,"Very Beatles, not very original...","This comeback was a big letdown. I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like ""the Hurting"" or ""Songs from the Big Chair""...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality. ""Everybody Loves a Happy Ending"" is like the song ""Sowing the Seeds of Love"", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.It wasn't a happy ending."
2,"A departure from the classic ""Tears for Fears"" sound","The Roland Orzabal-Curt Smith reunion has been long awaited by many. The two guys are symbolic of quality music that will stand the test of time. Roland Orzabal made a successful transition to a 90s sound with ""Elemental"" while maintaing the Tears for Fears essence. It would be natural for one to expect a similar transition in 2004. Unfortunately, Roland and Curt have departed from their classic sound to something that sounds like the Beatles. The only song that is reminiscent of classic Tears for Fears is ""Secret World"". Most of the other songs are forgettable. ""Everyone loves a happy ending"" is not the milestone I was hoping it would be for the musical careers of Roland and Curt.Songs for the casual fan: Secret World, Last days on earth"
5,Can we please make this music popular?,"What an excellent, excellent, EXCELLENT album. A casual fan from their heyday, I bought the disc because of the reviews here, and the magic word (Beatles). It is Beatle-y, by way of XTC, with some Pink Floyd by way of Alan Parsons and the Troy Westfield Experience. Seems like there's a bit of a dropoff after track 7 or 9 or so, but it'd be tough to keep up the pace to that point. I'm a compulsive listener, meaning I'm always looking for that next disc/band to wear out my player, but I'm not even sure when I'll get to the new Elliott Smith now. Also reminds me of some of my other favorites -- Jason Falkner, Brendan Benson, Jeff Buckley, Dada, even Sloan, in descending order of relevance. Hope people dig this is much as I do."
3,You've heard it before - about a thousand times,"Another fine album from XTC....er, I mean Jellyfish."
1,"They can still craft a song, unfortunately they're not good","This CD is a dog and painfully embarrassing to listen to. The songs are all well crafted, as you would expect, but they're not good songs.What were they thinking? They used to be so good. On this CD every song sounds like the theme music to any children's television show from the sixties. Several songs start off well only to be completely ruined when the horrible sing-along vocals kick in.Beatle-esque? Sure there are some musical elements reminiscent of the Beatles, but not the vocals. If the Beatles sang like that they would have been forgotten 35 years ago.Be warned, quality-wise, this CD is the direct opposite of The Hurting, Songs From the Big Chair and Elemental."
1,What happened??!!,"Oh no, this CD is terrible! I'm sorry, TFF, I've been a BIG fan since the beginning and have really loved Ronald's solo career with Elemental and Raoul, but I am so disappointed with this new release. It lacks depth and soul. It's cheesy and childish. It's way too Beatles-ish and 70's psychadelic. No good meanings in the lyrics. Can't quite tell what the heck they're singing about and can't get through most of the songs without having to turn off. The only song that's good is 'Quiet Ones'. I just don't hear the musical genious that has always been TFF. I hope they haven't finally taken their turn for the worst like so many other bands. Or, maybe Ronald should go solo again..."
1,TFF is D.O.A.,"I bought the album, listened through it once, and dumped it the same day. This is faux Beatles at best which is a bad thing. After a an opening track that you have no idea where it's going, it moves into Closer To Heaven which sounds like a lamer version of Sowing The Seeds Of Love. The album gets increasing dull and unmemorable as it goes on. If you're going to put a band back together, you better have something new to say. Except for nostalgic purposes, as a TFF fan myself, this was a sad waste."
2,Not so happy...,I really have tried hard to like this CD but have failed. I should say the album failed me. I love TFF. I welcome the reunion and new CD. I dig that there is a strong Beatles vibe. But the songs just don't work for me. Most of the songs don't even sound like TFF. I'm not against anything new. In the end I wouldn't recommend.
5,Wonderful,I loved this album. I went to see them in concert and they played a few songs that I didn't know. So I looked up on line and was surprised to find out that they had made an album in 2004. It is a wonderful album and a little different style from their other songs. Love it!
2,Kevin F,"I am perhaps the biggest T4F fan out there. Sowing the seeds and Elemental are among the best albums I have ever heard. I love Roland's thick production, his layered orchestration and his enigmatic lyrics. Unfortunately this album sounds like that unmelodic spew that curt recorded (Mayfield) which to me is just no-hook waves of falsetto dribble. Happy ending is way too Beatle-like for my taste. The tunes do grow on you but Tomcats will get much more play than this album, which sounds like a broadway show soundtrack to me."
2,A long awaited disappointment,"I am the biggest and most loyal TFF fan there is, but this cd is an uninspired stinker. In my opinion, every TFF album was wondeful up until Elemental (the jewel in the crown, I believe). But then came Raoul...not a big thrill. And then Roland's solo album - yuck. And now this one. It really bums me out. Roland is a dark, layered, brooding talent, with a magnificently angst-ridden/melancholy voice...and yet he is putting out these lame songs. No doubt that the mastering is brilliant, and that these songs are all put together well, but the songs are tired, soulless. He does sound beautiful on many of them, but there is no thrill. There is no going back for another listen and hearing something for the first time. I feel like that with Elemental, with Seeds, and even with the others.But I doubt I'll be going back to Happy Ending in search of anything. And that makes me sad."
5,Blown Away,"I'm cheap when it comes to awarding stars, no doubt about it. I will be up front and state that I have enjoyed Tears For Fears albums for some time. Forget that fact, I enter into this with no prior jading.This is the BEST Tears For Fears album to date. I fell in love with it after its first listen. I haven't tired of it yet. Roland and Curt have managed to mend their fences and produce an incredible aural landscape. It's a rare album that produces nothing but rock solid tunes. ""Everybody Loves A Happy Ending,"" is one of those rare albums.My fondest wish is that this album gets radio airplay and spreads the word about how a 15 year absence means nothing. In some cases, absence does make the heart and music grow fonder."
4,Impressive release that smacks of the Beatles,"I bought this CD based on reviews I read on Amazon.com. I don't think I've ever done that before! With the majority of reviewers lauding this release, I took the chance...here's what I found:Darn good stuff!! The opening song, ""Everybody Loves a Happy Ending"", started off very mellow...then all of the sudden ""Wake Up!"". It WAS the Beatles! With a smile on my face, I began to bop with the very up tempo song. I fantastic start. As the CD continued to its end, I knew the reviewers were right - this is GOOD STUFF.My definite favs on the CD are: Everybody Loves a Happy Ending; Who Killed Tangerine? (the chorus at the 2'30'' mark ""and when you think it's all over"" is one hell of a chorus; The Devil, which, again, is heavily influenced by the Beatles and Killing with Kindness.In the 80s/90s I had a ""love/hate"" thing with Tears, but with release it's all love!"
4,Sounding Like the Beatles is a Good Thing!,"This latest set of tunes from TFF is very remeniscent of their Seeds of Love album and very Beatlesque (is that a word?). If I didn't know who the band was, I would guess it was some rare Beatles recording. I must say that I do like this album and I like both Tears For Fears and I like the Beatles too. This is a very upbeat set of great songs by the guys who brought us Shout and Woman in Chains. Great place to start if you are new to TFF and a great addition to any folks who are already fans of these much overlooked talented fellows. Very good. - Ciao"
4,Great CD,"Every song but one is great and it was so exciting to hear new stuff from the guys now they are back together.Only complaint is the basic rhythm tracks lack that live groove thatgave their songs so much punch.It sounds like it was recorded a bit here and bit there on computer and then thrown together in the mix, it lacks a real ""Band"" feel.Still a great album though."
4,It's Worth The Wait . . .,I am just wondering why the album sales hasn't taken off. Listened to it a few times and am already hooked. Although it would have been better had there been more catchy songs but overall the album's superb!
2,Some good songs but poor sound quality,I am a big fan of TFF and this album has some of good to great songs. I bought the UK edition with a couple of more tracks. I would give 3 or 4 stars if the sound quality was the typical TFF. But I don't know why the music sounds like a very poor mp3.
3,2004 Beatles,"Yes. In 1967 The Beatles stunned the world and changed the rock scene forever with the Sgt. Pepper's album and songs like Strawberry Fields Forever. I'm sorry to say that Tears For Fears is not stunning anyone in 2004 with this new release; although I have to acknowledge that they're excellent Beatles' copycats. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great (like one would expect from any Beatles album). But I can't stand it when bands depart their origins and try to do ""different"" things, maybe in an effort to increase sales. This album, although beautifully produced, is way below the standard they set in the 1980's with their two masterpieces: Songs From The Big Chair and The Seeds of Love."
1,UGHHHH!!!,"What has happen to this band ? This is a band that had so much promise back in the 80's. This album reeks of Beatle-esque music. I can't believe this is the same band that did the classic album ""The Hurting"" !!! What went wrong????"
1,BORING,I am a die hard fan form 1983 and I have loved most of Roland's work including his solo tomcats screaming album. I bought all of the cd singles as well as the group puts some very good songs on them. But I have too say that for a rock band and one with so much artistic talent it is an unforgivable sin to be boring. I was glad to hear curt smith was back but I think Roland Orzabel did most of his best work without curt. I hope they can get their act together and get back to what made them a cut above the bands from the 80's.
5,A welcome back,"Long awaited Tears For Fears CD has finally arrived, with 12 new songs and a much intisipated welcome back. Although the new CD lacks the edge of Elemental and Raoul and the Kings of Spain, this CD is very creative and more catchy then previous albums. Call me melow, and closest thing to heaven would sit comfortably on the radio and make for excellent singles. Killing with Kindess and Quiets ones are the two edgiest songs on the album, mixed up with alternative rock, two great songs! While the rest of the CD proves that after all these years Roland and Curt still have it. A must for any Tears For Fears fan, or anyone wanting to hear good music"
5,THE BEST CD IN 14 YEARS!,"I have been a true and loyal fan through the years. Every T4F album has a special place in my heart that brings back fond memories of the times past. Now that I'm 45 years old, it is hard to get excited about music as I did in my younger days. However, since I purchased this cd I can't get enough of it. I liked the songs the first time of hearing them which is unusual for me (with other artists that is). These songs just play over and over in my head and I just can't get enough. The two of them together make the most beautiful harmonious music -- Secret Garden and Lady Bird are simply inspiring! Even my 8 year old son can't stop singing the tunes. I was fortunate enough to see them in Atlantic City a couple of weeks ago, and their show was fantastic! It is a shame the radio isn't playing a single tune from this incredible cd. THey are pure magic together and I wish them most success -- and hopefully, another cd before 14 years go past."
5,I Can't Believe So Great A Book Got Published!!!!,"This magnificent twenty-odd pounds of compliation publishes in paper form several thousand of the best, wittiest and most culturally-defining cartoons from nine decades worth of The New Yorker. As if that isn't enough, it also includes on CD ALL--that's every single one, folks--cartoons EVER published in the magazine. Charles Addams is here in all his demented glory, as are half a hundred other artists. From the follies of 1920's Flappers to the inane antics of the prosperous Clinton years, this book pulls no punches as it delivers some of the most excellent satire and sight gags known to humankind. Absolutely worth the price! One for the ages. A reconstruction of 20th century fads, politics, daily life and popular culture. I bought this as a selfish Christmas gift for a relative, knowing he'd let me borrow it. Two birds with one stone, you could say, and you might want to take a hint. I could go on and on but this work instantly speaks for itself!"
3,Size to small from toe area,"The only reason these shoes got a 3 is because they are too small from the toe section. Wife put them on and her feet hurt from being too tight at open end. What ever size you wear, we recommend you order one size bigger! We ordered 7 and should have ordered 8 to make sure they fit..."
3,Entertaining for kids,"I was disappointed in this book. its a small book, with cartoon like drawings and a few color photos in the center of the book. I truly didnt know it was written for kids[ comes with a couple of funtime quizes]. Its not a horrible book, just not great for an adult."
3,TOO SMALL!!!,"I got the book and it was smaller then I expected. I mean I thought it would of been the size of a ""normal"" book, but it wasnt. However, the book is very good and fun for kids! I got it for a Christmas present and I hope he'll be happy with it. What I mean is you know how kids like ""big"" things, this is just really small. Im sure he will like the facts :)O yea and its not in color. Only the bonus pages are color and thats only 6 pages"
5,Best Kitchen Appliance I've Bought,"I don't ordinarily buy things I see on TV infomercials, but my husband bought the Showtime Rotisserie for Christmas this year and it's the best kitchen appliance we've purchased! Everything we have made in it comes out tasting fantastic. We've done game hens, chicken, fish, roast beef, pork and ribs in it, and everything is absolutely delicious! Clean-up is easy, especially if you cover the drip tray in aluminum foil. The only part that is impossible to clean is behind the heating element. I wish they would make it removable.Everything cooks much faster than in a conventional oven, and you use less marinade and basting sauces than you would in a conventional oven or BBQ grill. The Junior is the perfect size for 1 or 2 people. Buy the black, as the white has discolored a bit from the heat.You can quiet the noise referred to in a previous review by placing a drop or two of cooking oil on the gears inside the oven, and where the spit rests (the factory told us this)."
1,you might get your goose cooked too,"I used this for a little over a year,but only made 6 meals with it.The seventh time I used it the electricmotor did not spin the rotisserie. I am an electrician by trade,and after examining the unit, found out that the contacts inside the three way switch that controls the rotation had gotten hot and melted the plastic housing. I called ronco customer service and and they told me to send the unit in and for $79 they would replace it. I told them that I just needed a $3 switch they then said that ronco does not sell any replacement parts but if anything goes wrong they have an exchange policy only.Call them for yourself and you will see. It looks good and cooks chicken well but it can also cook your goose if even a knob or anything else breaks on this machine and you have to send the whole unit in for a rebuilt exchange unit."
4,I love my set it!,I had one of these in the larger size and then when I moved I left it behind :( So when I decided I couldn't live without it I decided to get the JR since I was just cooking for one. I love how easy and foolproof it is but I have noticed it has quite the obnoxious squeaking sound if its holding say a large 5lb or more chicken. The squeaking is annoying but its ok because this takes all the guesswork out of cooking meats and they are ALWAYS so juicy and flavorful :-)
5,Best Kitchen Appliance,I bought the Popeil Jr Rotisserie and use it weekly. Even roaststhat you would normally have to slow cook come out great. I live in Arizona and with the summer coming I intend to use this even more. It is faster and better than the outside BBQ grill. I just might buy the bigger one so I can do my Thanksgiving turkey.
3,short lifed appliance,This product DOES make great chicken but the electrical wiring gets hot and switch goes bad. After three months of use my Pro Rotisserie stopped working due to over heating of the wiring and the rotating swith went bad. E-mail to company got me no response. Before buying this product I e-mailed Ronco with a guestion about the unit. Unfortunately I bought it before getting there response 2 1/2 months later. This is the last product I will purchase from Ronco!
2,Blurry picture....to lazy to clean up before transferring to blu ray. Kinda defeats the idea of HD.,Clean this blurry video up BEFORE you put it on Blu Ray...it is not HD at all! I might as well just purchased the DVD instead.
2,OK but not that good,"Ive played guitar for most of my life , and although I have great respect for DM's chops of steel , to me the lyrics sounded off . Daves voice just seemed pitchy . And the intervierw in the beginning when he's riding in the car , does he sound like he just snorted a bunch of coke ?? To me his voice just sounded almost meek and shaky . Maybe Im a bit biased . The first Megadeth concert DVD I purchased was RUDE AWAKENING . To me , the guitar and drums sound much more tighter than on this DVD . I could almost write the same review for the RUST in PEACE concert DVD . The only difference is , the fans in Buenos Aires were just over the top . They could not have been any more adoring than they were to Megadeth . Anyway , I still like all 3 of the DVD's mentioned in my review , I just think RUDE AWAKENING has it all , Dave's voice is great , and the band is super tight ."
3,"Good concert, but less content","It is a good concert DVD, but ""Rude Awakening"" is much more better. Buy "" Rude Awakening"" DVD if you have limited money.This DVD lacks some offline content, behind the scenes and stuff like that, since fans expect more inside materials.The title denoted as ""Symphony of Destruction remix"" is not actually a remix. I could observe no differences with respect to the standard content of the DVD."
5,At last,this is a very godd DVD not only becasue is megadeath but becasue is a great show and the last one
1,Very low volume .. i am really upset,"The download sucks. I called them like 10 times saying that the volume is really low on this video, but nothing so far. I am so upset. I was really excited about getting Megadeth concert on download. I have been waiting for 6 days now for these people to 'resolve the issue and fix the problem'"
4,Solid Effort,"Very good concert DVD. Camera angles are a plus. Very impressed with the Drover brothers.I know a few people had some specific gripes about the DVD. Here's mine. A major moment in any show is the band's entrance onstage. The director chose to chop that moment out. Big mistake. The show basically opens a few seconds into Blackmail The Universe. Whoever signed off on that edit needs to have their head checked. Whoops!Otherwise, a very enjoyable show."
1,It's a joke???,"The worst picture and soud quality i ever seen!!!!!I play this blu ray in a 50'' Philips HD plasma, Marantz UD 7006 3D blu ray player, Krell electronics and Focal JM Lab Electra 946 loudspeakers.The picture quality is even worst that the DVD.The sound quality is really a shame.Lovers of rock and high definition concerts, don't waste your money.Very disappointed.A TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!!"
2,A total RIP OFF!!!,"This review is not about the actual performance of the band; I'm giving it two stars because it is not a true Hi-Def release. This is an extremely shoddy standard-def upscaled to 1080i Blu ray release. There is NO visual advantage to purchasing this blue ray over the dvd version. You get a few extra tracks, and a (great sounding) DTS-MA soundtrack, but for a blue ray release you would expect some nice visual detail: you don't get it. Faces, crowd shots, guitar strings, logos, are all blurry and undefined. Image Entertainment ought to be embarrassed at the laziness of this release, and the disrespect shown to Mega-fans, that they would release a third rate product like this knowing the fans will buy it anyway. For Blu-ray, do yourself a favor and pick up the far superior Megadeth: Rust in Peace live at the Hollywood Palladium, a terrific presentation shot on hi-def digital cameras."
3,Was this necessary?,"This is a pretty cool concert performance but I don't get it. The Rude Awakening DVD is far better in my opinion. The band line-up was better back then with David Ellefson still in the band, along with Al Pitrelli and Jimmy Degrasson on drums. A way tighter band than what is shown here. You only get one new song from ""the system has failed"", the rest is old stuff. They play almost the exact same songs as the Rude Awakening DVD and almost in the same order. But the RUDE performance sounded much better with better production and tighter performances from the band in my opinion. If you're looking for a cool Megadeth concert DVD, I recommend Rude Awakening over this. However, I did just watch this for free on Netflix instant view, so I can't complain!"
3,live megadeth but where's the bass,well i have this vidio and i enjoy watching it the over all sound is goodloud guitars and also the kick drum sounds great.but the bass guitar is to low in the mix.i dont know the bass might have sounded good at the show but in this vidio mix i can hardly hear the bass guitar.you know bass guitar is just as important as the guitars and drums.so anyway yes the song list is good and dave is playing a great game but it sounds sort of thin.now if you wanna hear good bass guitar in the mix check out live iron maiden dvds.and i also think deicide's live in london sounds great with bass and everything.oh there is one more i wanna tell ya about testament live in london has got a little better bass sound in the mix than this live dvd by megadeth.think about what i've said here before buying this dvd...RAY G BROCK.
5,SImply awesome,"This is a very awesome concert, definitely worth the money. It was a bit lacking in special features, but hey, you don't buy a concert for the special features, even though they are a nice thing to have. They play a good variety of songs from many different albums, including a rare performance of Ill be There. Plus, Dave sings part of Trust in spanish. I thought this was a plus, even though I dont speak a word of spanish, I like it when bands do something special with songs when they play them live. If you are a metal fan, this concert is a must see for sure."
3,The cd is better,I have both the cd and dvd. some of the good songs were cut out of the dvd. the cd has more tracks. if you have a choice between the cd and dvd chose cd you get more.
2,Megadeth's sound is huge... this just sounds weak,"I too was psyched for this DVD. I've seen the band several times the past couple years, and think they are pumping on all cylinders. However, the sound production on this DVD just really disappointed me. There is no punch to it at all. Honestly, I have trouble watching it for this reason. I've heard the cds sound better, I am a huge 'deth fan so I may gave them a try. But this DVD left me feeling empty."
2,Was this a tenth grade english project?,"The author definitely has an interesting story here, but she really needed to hire a ghost writer, or at the very least, an editor. The typos and grammatical errors and tense shifts are so glaring and distracting it's really hard to take this seriously."
1,Not worth reading,"Reading the book was hard, not only because of the subject matter but even more so because of the lousy grammar and editing. If you can wade through the amateurish writing and you will find a horror story. The problem here is that it isn't true and the real horror is that someone, even a vanity press like the publisher, would publish such unfounded fallacies.I grew up in St. Coleman's at the same time the author was there, she hasn't changed much over the years and still is incapable of facing reality. I don't doubt for a minute that she actually believes what she says as she never seemed very stable. The book does not even come close to being a truthful portrayal of life at St. Coleman's. No doubt the good nuns at St. Coleman's understand and forgive her for the libel."
1,Insane,"I was at St.Colman's at the same time the author was. I remember her as a trouble maker, liar and had a bad temper, she who was always getting into trouble. The book is so poorly written and just garbage. I was there, and this is all just lies."
1,A nun at St Colman's,"Hard to believe that the author is peddling her book on several ISP message boards and claims that she abused a nun at St Colman's, but according to the book, ""she was abused."" This is a deeply disturbed and severely damaged person with issues of hate, bigotry and anger. I read the book and it was ""thrown away."" I should have read the NY book reviews earlier. They quickly rejected it for lack of content and fakery.Author's quote: I SIMPLY WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO PHYSICALLY ABUSE ME. IF THEY HIT ME I HIT THEM BACK. I WAS FOLLOWING A BASIC CHRISTIAN PRINCIPAL. DO UNTO OTHERS AND ALL THAT. I TOLD SISTER REGINA MORE THAN ONCE, IF YOU HIT ME I WILL HIT YOU BACK. SHE DID, SO I DID. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? HOW MANY PEOPLE NOW OR IN YOUR CHILDHOOD WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE TO HIT THEM ON A DAILY BASIS?SZIPPITY@aol.com"
2,Very Small,"Don't let the description of ""up to 2 inches tall"" fool you. These are very small and are not appropriate for preschool children. If you have a child in your home under age 3, they are dangerous. The characters are not attatched to the bases, and are about the height of a quarter without the base."
4,"Good quality, but very small","These figures matched the description exactly - very small, but high quality Disney Princesses. I used them to decorate my daughter's cake for her 5th birthday and she absolutely adored them. The previous reviewer complained about the size, but I'm not sure if she / he read the description ahead of time. Yes...they are ""vending machine"" small, but they are high enough quality to put onto any little girl's cake to their delight. (Yes...do not give small toys or objects to children who would find these a choking hazard.)"
3,TINY! Used for easter eggs!,"I thought this product would be similar to other figurines but they are very small! I bought a wooden castle for Christmas for my princess-loving 5 year old and it required smaller figurines. I bought these, but they ended up being way too small for the castle. I used them at Easter since they are already packaged in vending machine ""eggs"" (the smaller kind that rings would come in.) I have not seen her play with them and the figures come apart from their bases, so she has lost some already. I admit that I was doing some late night shopping and did not pay attention to the product information that is listed, so it would be unfair to give any lower a rating. I believe that these are overpriced and should be much cheaper considering they are so small and are intended for vending machines. They would work for a cake or cupcakes but not with my budget!"
3,EDUCATIONAL-O.T.,"I felt the book was well written and had an enormous amount of information, however it was not applicable to the special education program I work in. Although I am commited to my profession, I do not have time to read whole chapters in class or during a break. I would have preferred a more teacher/parent friendly book in order to assist others with treatment planning whenever our occupational therapists are not involved with the classroom."
2,Not really specific to pugs,"There is a lot of information specific to pugs like; shedding, overheating, housetraining issues, as well as their eyes. This was not covered. It was very generic about dogs. I think the title is misleading."
1,This is not Gilbreto Gil - these are covers!,This is a CD of songs of Gil performed by others. And most of the covers are pretty lousy too. Stay away.
4,Surprisingly Good,"I was actually surprised when I tried this coffee. I wasn't expecting too much, since Folgers is a supermarket brand of coffee. However, I discovered Folgers Hazelnut Whole Bean Coffee is as good as any of the supermarket ""gourmet"" coffees I've tried. (This is not to be confused with low-volume, gourmet, specialty coffees.)The beans produce a rich, flavorful cup of coffee with just enough hazelnut flavor. Not overpowering nor weak.I did notice there were inconsistencies in the roasting of the beans (some lighter, some darker) which averaged out to a medium roast. You may need to adjust the amount of coffee used, per pot, for your tastes.For the price, this coffee is a great value.Be sure to add other items to your order to qualify for free shipping as the shipping cost would diminish the value."
2,Difficult to read,The book is very dense and difficult to understand. The title is very appealing but the content of the book is very intellectual. When I bought the book I was looking for practical ideas to focus on the present moment in psychotherapy. It was difficult for me to stay engaged and interested. I resorted to flipping pages then giving up on it.
3,Strange,This movie was very strange. The husband is insane. But the movie is very passionate and the graphics are beautiful. The story line makes you feel you were missing a little something but I am not quite sure what it was. It wasn't as sound as it should be. But this is worth watching.
1,Not worth the time,"Someone needs to tell Aishwarya Rai and Zayed Khan that they cannot act. The movie is very strange indeed, unlike your usual Bollywood flair. It's an interesting story and I am sure there is nothing original about how the story unfolds or the plot. Sanjay Dutt is not a bad actor, mediocre perhaps, certainly better than Rai and Khan put together. This film is a total waste of time."
3,Shaft Length Not As Advertized,"Buffer just arrived directly from Amazon. Seemed like a pretty good deal since the thing is heavy and shipping was free. Trouble is that the measured length of the 5/8"" arbor shaft is only 2 inches, not 3 inches as stated in the product description. I had already ordered buffs intending to stack them on the shaft. They now won't fit, so I'll have to figure something else out. Buyer beware."
2,Not for me,First ship would not run or start and was returned. Second ship would run but both bearings heated up and bound the shaft. Due to an immediate need I had to shim the end bells out to loosen the bearing races. Still sounds kind of rough. Amazon was 100% with a quick return and replacement. Turned a disaster into a mere disapointment.
3,Not the best PKD,"Although the plot and narrative are what you'd expect, in my opinion the way it unfolds left me wanting it to have at least 5 more chapters. Good one, but certainly not the best."
4,Even Second-Rank Dick is Better than Just About Anyone Else,"In the middle of the 21st century, the U.S. and Europe have merged into a federal union dominated by Germany, and nothing is what it seems. The powerless president is a robot (a simulacra), the powerful first lady is seemingly immortal (but is an impostor, ""portrayed"" by a sucession of actresses), and the nation is actually ruled by a secret council and by enginering and pharmaceutical cartels. As always in Dick, each page has enough throwaway ideas and incidental invention to make a career for an ordinary SF writer (genetically enginered commercials that people swat like flies, for example). In Dick's novels, fraud, illusion, and hallucination abound, but are always balanced by his deep compassion for people and their unresolvable plights. A flawed masterpiece from SF's greatest writer."
4,fun and paranoia in the us,"phil has definitely taken the gloves off with this one. having germany as the 55th state of the union and bringing back nazis to set govrnment policy, its a bonanza of paranoia and humor"
4,Prescient!,"""The Simulacra"" is probably the most convoluted, mystifying--and potentially dangerous--political thriller ever penned. With his trademark ear for dialogue and sensitivity to human foibles, Dick eviscerates authority in all of its guises, revealing levels of curruption and secrecy so vast and complex they transcend the comical. Along with such masterpieces as ""Radio Free Albemuth"" and ""Time Out of Joint,"" ""The Simulacra"" is one of Dick's most effective conspiracy yarns, written with irony, insight and humor. As usual, Dick excels at evoking a world where nothing is as it seems and truth is the rarest of commodities. Vintage's reissue of this scathing novel couldn't have come at a better time."
2,shallow and quick,"This one is rather quick and shallowly written. There is something there but it feels rushed and underdeveloped. The main premise is that Western World is run by an artificial organism pretending to be a real human behind which there is shadowy group etc. - the idea that things are not as they seem, and that this democracy of ours is anything but. That's all fine, except that the writing is not very well developed - it's got a rushed feel to it that leaves you a bit unsatisfied at the end."
1,"Not as advertised, never buy furniture off the internet","They describe this unit as ""mahogany"". Now I'm not sure what crazy definition of mahogany they were looking at but this is about as far from mahogony as it gets. More like, orange pine. I contacted the vendor about returning for a refund, but found that they wouldn't cover the shipping back. With an item that weighs about 100 lbs, there is no way I could (or want) to drag the box down to the car and to the post office and pay ANOTHER $50 shipping to send it back. What a waste, wouldn't recommend this item unless you actually want cheap light plywood."
1,Headache,This gave me a terrible headache. Tried waiting a few days and starting it again but got a headache again.
1,Don't waste your money or time,The unit did not meet any of the claims the manufacturer/supplier boasted. Furthermore the instructions were poorly written and often incomplete. Clearly not written by Egnlish speaking people/person.
1,Misleading product description,"What the product description does not tell you is this: You need to subscribe to caller ID from your phone company just to use the call block feature. Nowhere does the description here say this. It truly is ""buyer beware"" with this product."
5,"Williams-Sonoma Mastering: Sauces, Salsas & Relishes","The book is a really fine course for making basic sauces from which many other sauces can be made. The salsa and relishes are good too, but my interest is in making mother sauces and proliferating them to many other great sauces for the way they complement many great foods."
5,Maybe More Useful than Spock,"I have to agree with Kathy. I bought this book in 1972 some months after my son was born. It is the only book I ever found that actually gave me the confidence to parent. It helped me to know what to do, as well as telling me when it was age appropriate or psychologically appropriate to do it. I gave my copy to someone years ago but the information in it has stayed with me all these years -- because it worked! I became a better parent and a more patient one too. Buy Spock for your child's physical care, but definitely Dodson for her/his emotional and psychological care. Saved my sanity, too!"
4,Now your playing with power!,this powerstrip is the best powerstrip ive ever owned.. has 12 outlets & can support all 12 high power draining entertainment gizmo's with out any flickering what so ever.. 1 only problem tho. you need to have a (duplex receptacle outlet) a new wall socket that looks like this --| | ( and of course with the grounding O on the bottom)the left prong hole must have a sideways socket to be able to plug this bad boy in. you can find one real easy at a homedepot. but besides the wall socket issue this powerstrip is nice!
4,Perfect fit,"We bought this because we need to extend the reach of the wall socket and for that it performed nicely. The big plus for me is that by chance the tall microwave rack we had also used a Tripp Lite cord panel so it was a perfect fit for the rack and matched the other, like it was meant to be there."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"An Elseworlds story set in the 19th century. Superman decides to uses his gifts to help speed progress, and works alongside people such as Barry Allen and Ted Knight in a League of Science.Lex Luthor has other ideas on how to approach this, however."
3,"Fun times, but what is this book about again?","Written very stylistically, like a faster paced mix of Burroughs and Stephenson. Hilareous black comedy in this city of Beerlight where crime is art but it may or may not be virtual reality.The cop Blince is a character no doubt, and the time travel wackiness of Dante one and Two is gripping. But there is just so much going on in these short 150 pages that it is very difficult to follow what's going on. I guess that's the cyberpunk syle, but this takes it a bit far. Information overload to the tenth degree here.I'm giving it three stars even though Slaughtermatic is an incredible read. I know its well written, it is just unfortunate that I'm not too sure what the book is about. I'll have to try and read it a second time and maybe my opinion will change.Mr. Aylett, you're just too hip for your own good."
2,Not quite what I expected,"Based on the reviews I thought this would be a fun sort of book and worth a bit of time reading. I was, unfortunately, gravely disappointed. It reads like Douglas Adams on acid, only not quite as coherent. The other book that jumps to mind is sections of the Illuminatus Trilogy, without the conspiracy.Overall, I just didn't see the point. Neat ideas, I guess, funny in a strange sort of way, but not enough of either or a sensible storyline or plot or concept behind it to make it worth struggling through to find the interesting parts.I suspect I'm just a bit too linear to like this. Which isn't to say it's bad, I just don't like it."
3,So-so,Aylett seems to be trying too hard with this one. Of course alot of his later books have that going on...cockiness can get in the way between a good story idea and a good story on paper. Behold! Aylett and his lost boy 'Mulder on downers' look is just too precious a thing to not buy his books. Keep trying Steve.....you're bound to recapture that ingenuity that has long since been replaced with whatever it is you use as a muse these days.
3,Make my headache go away,"Reading Slaughtermatic hurt more than if someone had slammed it over my head a few times. There is no denying that Aylett's use of words is original (making it worth reading) but I had to take it in small doses to get it to digest.The world Aylett writes about is so bizarre and his lingering details made me wonder if he really needed to add so much. The story istelf is a little too strange for my taste, but the style kept my curious eye. If you can handle it, give it a read. Check out the reading sample and makre sure it fits your appetite."
2,Too hard to follow whats going on,"This book has some good funny lines, and a very interesting plot. If only the author wrote in a way where it was easier to follow. Half the time I didn't know what was going on, where the characters were, or who was who talking. The names are hard to remember, there were too many characters, and it was just a big mess to read. I was so interested in the plot, but it was too confusing to follow. The author only writes action, not narrative, so he doesn't explain whats going on. You basically have to guess for yourself. NO thanks, I do enough work at work. Reading is for pleasure, not for head aches."
2,Good book for a smart 14 year old boy,"A stylish easy read that lacks the substance to take off, like a great cartoon. Smart and funny in spots but never challenging."
4,Entertaining and surreal,"Bu√±uel meets Tarantino meets Gibson in this ultraviolent, surreal mess of cyberpunk cliches. Coherency here is traded off for significant amounts of imagination and entertainment value, as well as a few sharp notions here and there; the result reads more like verse than prose, and your enjoyment of the material will vary directly with how much a psychotic, book-length, knee-deep-in-blood-and-shells poem appeals to you. It's not quite as deep as it thinks it is - or at least, it lacks the clarity to prove it - and the plot burbles into the background, but the energy and the verbal imagination never lets up. Recommended highly, but with reservations."
4,"Confusing.... but, Aylett still rocks.","The often times befuddling plotline gets saved easily by Aylett's superb writing...in my opinion anyways. It reminded me of 'Naked Lunch' in a bizzarre sort of a way... where almost every line you read is a quotable piece of warped poetry, or song lyric, or sample for a song. Granted, this style of writing can be hard to swallow at times; but, when you are in the mood for this book, it's incredible. My most deeply layered wit grinned many times at Aylett's seemingly random/chaotic craftiness."
5,Nice Kitchen Towels,"These towels match my kitchen perfectly. I do wish they had smaller dish cloths to match though. I do like them very much, they also wash very well."
3,"Pretty, but they shrink","I like the colors a lot, but these towels really do shrink. After one washing (lukewarm), they all are inches shorter, and the waffleweaves are inches smaller than the stipes in both dimensions. As a result, not only do you have smaller towels, but the solids and stripes don't look like they go together. Too bad."
4,PS1 game,Soundtrack reminds me of the game. Interesting tunes. Use some of the track on my workout file. Others are on my relaxation file. Remember the game.
3,Only for Bostitch,These nails are only made for a Bostitch 25 degree finish nail gun. Most finish nailers are 34 degree. They did usually work in my Freeman gun with occassional jams. Would not buy again.
4,Fair price,"I just bought finish nails at Home Depot for about $12, so if you are going to use these nails and have at least a $25 order it is worth it!"
4,VHF Uniden UM-625,Colour screen is much better than the B&W; that is usual. We like this unit.It replaced a Uniden 525 that a lightning strike fried.
3,Lovely and Elegant,"This is really a beautiful nightlight. It stands on it's own next to a market of cheap plastic concoctions. All of the flowers are quite well represented, so I'm sure you could find your favorite.The cons are simply that the light does not so much filter through the covering as just shine directly atop the fixture, rather too brightly for a nightlight.The other, more unpleasant negative is the life of the light is rather short. My Mother purchased a different flower and only a few weeks later the lighting mechanism has burned out. It doesn't look to be too difficult to remove the outer shell to replace the lighting, but it's still a hassle. Though in the long run it might be better as you could choose a softer light that was more representative of it's purpose."
3,Dell lsd,"The reason I am rating this low is because I ordered this product used and when I received it, it was not packed very well and the lcd monitor was damaged. It was not usable at all. Money was refunded."
3,Does not contain rear springs,"I bought this kit because it was significantly less money here than anywhere else I could find. Now I know why. This package does not include the rear springs that are normally sold in this package by other vendors. So, you'll need to add the rear springs, which brings the price right in line with all the other vendors on the 'net.If you want to raise your rear too, be sure you order the rear springs to match."
4,Great case for the ViewMaster reels!,"This soft rubber storage case is a must for the ViewMaster reels. We bought it when we bought the ViewMaster as a great option to keep all the reels together in one place and from getting dirty when not being used. The reels can bend easily and don't really have a good storage option otherwise. My 2.5 year old son would probably have bent or scratched the reels by now if we didn't have it. The storage case is large enough to hold plenty of reels, probably 50-75. It is well constructed and the zipper opens and closes with ease.I'm giving this product four stars because it could really use something to hold the reels in place or a cushioning pad inside the case. As it is, they can move around inside it, and if treated roughly could still get a little damaged. (See pictures added above).It's a great idea for protecting your reels and almost a necessity if you have a ViewMaster."
3,Serves it's purpose,"This case is fine for what we wanted....to keep my grandchildren's View Masters safe from bending & organized. It is not really educational, but does teach responsibility for cleaning up after you play and taking care of things to keep them in good condition. It is also easy to take along in the car or where ever we travel & want to take the View Masters to occupy the kids."
4,Good read,I read westerns as a break from detective and mystry books. This one is pretty good. It kept my interest.
2,"Ok as far as it goes,,,","This book was far too brief for me. I was disapponited because I could not capture the essence of the ideas expounded by each philosopher. The pages are divided into three columns. One column on each page is for quotes or antedotes. The top fifth of the page is used for birth and death, main interest, influences etc, there are pictures of the philospher, and occasionally other art works. This doesn't leave much room for discussion. I'm still looking for something readable and useful. Strangely, I did not find Voltaire in this book. Overall, it did not do it for me"
3,Cool book...,"But where's Merleau-Ponty? Where's Saussure? Levi-Strauss? What the heck?Someone named Lady Welby-Gregory got included though (Who..?). Every other page (paper stock) in my copy is stiff, making flipping through it an exercise in fine motor skills."
2,good idea...not there yet,"Purchased for concealed carry with my off-duty Springfield XD 45. The holster has an internal auto locking feature (similar to a serpa holster). Unfortunately the unlocking mechanism is not in an intuitive or natural draw location. You have to ""sweep"" the latch with your middle finger while drawing with the last two. I am a Police Firearms instructor and it goes against what we teach in establishing your grip during a draw. I sent it back. Unfortunately there are very few leather ALS type holsters out there."
4,Good balls,Had a good mixture of name brand balls. A few more Wilson's than I like but a good buy overall.
3,What a Disappointment!,"Varese Records usually has some pretty classy releases, this is NOT one of them. After waiting years for these soundtracks to be released, we have been treated to sub-standard transfers and missing tracks. Especially annoying is the ""Huckleberry Finn"" soundtrack; a missing overture and an almost unlistenable transfer. This is actually an insult to injury being as the DVD transfer has ""Been formatted to fit your TV"" (no widescreen!). Although, the sound is much better on the DVD than on the CD. Unfortunately, this is all we get, that is why I gave this 3 stars instead of 2. By the way, one of the other reviews states that all the lyrics are contained in the booklet, this is not true, only the ""Tom Sawyer"" lyrics are printed. What a mess!"
1,Heavy Gunner Vietnam,i purchased Marine Heavy Gunner Vietnam and found it to be extremely poor programmed game. it is on the top list of sorry games on the market. They should learn how to write and program their games to be more like the Activision game called Call of Duty. Like I said Heavy Gunner is the sorriest game I ever tried to play.
1,Not worth $22 !,"This was a disappointment, but I was able to use it somewhat with my class. Basically it looks like someone's home movies!! The singing /dancing goes on too long and I was hoping there would be more of an explaination about the myth and why the men of Beqa practice firewalking. The best part in terms of educational use was the scene on the fish drive. Really charging US$22 for this is highway robbery! -- CB"
4,Fun Dinner Party Starter,"Great mix and mingle CD. All guest comments were ""Oh this is different, but I like it""!"
2,Not so good. Best thing about it is Lazy Lover,When I first heard of Lazy Lover I was totally blown away by how great that track was. So I researched and learned about the band and found out that they were working on an album which was to be released in about 6 months. Once the album came out I rushed out to get it but I was totally turned off. The mix of music does not make sense at all. I was looking for more tracks like Lazy Lover but nothing else on the album comes close to sounding like Lazy Lover. I was upset. So don't waste your time on this album if you are looking for more tunes like Lazy Lover. If you must get it then buy it used. It's disappointing!
5,REFRESHING AND RIVETING!!!,"What can you say when the lead singer, Sabina Sciubba, can speak six languages. She sings in four on the CD. One track is in French, one in German, one in Spanish and the rest in English. She has a beautiful voice. The band is very tight. You will find trip-hop, electronica, pop and jazz on this recording. Didi Gutman plays keyboards but also handles samples, beats and other sounds. Jesse Murphy (bass) and Aaron Johnston (drums) make up a competent rhythm section. After hearing the album and the EP, I was impressed. After seeing the band live, I was very impressed. Gutmans's playing was truly mesmerizing. I hope they stay around for awhile. Highly recommended!"
4,Close to Goldfrapp .. more lounge.. NOT Brazilian Music,"My profile: 42 yro. Progressive rock & Jazz fan1st, do not let the title confuse you expecting brazilian rhythyms, etc. This would be equivalent to expecting Swing Out Sister to be a teenage girlie band.They cover a broad range such as neo-tango, some fusion bossa nova, lounge music and exploring other frontiers much as Goldfrapp has done.Let it sink in with candles, red wine, some good friends relaxing..."
5,Brazilian Girls....,"This album is weird but in a good way....I can't even explain it...usually bands stick to just one thing...but these guys seem like they're all over the place. I love this album...Sabina Sciubba's voice is so incredibly sexy (her voice is sexy in all languages...French, German, Spanish and English). I'm usually not into this type of music but they are an exception. My favorite songs are HOMME (This song reminds me of Italy...I don't know why...the song is not even in ITALIAN...don't ask)...SIRENES DE LA FETE, CORNER STORE (I love the trumpets on this song), LONG, PUSSY (ha ha ha this song is too catchy), DIE GEDANKEN SIND FREI - THOUGHTS ARE FREE, All WE HAVE, and finally but not least....ME GUSTAS CUANDO CALLAS (love the chorus to this song). You guys seriously need to check out this band...they're addicting."
5,Been waiting a long time for a CD this GOOD!!!,"This is a great cd, it doesn't fit into any particular genera but why would you want it to, good vocals and baseline gives this cd a smooth groove.I saw Brazilian girls perform recently in Toronto and the show was sold our packed, great show. Make sure you check them out if they come to your neighborhood."
5,LOVE AT FIRST LISTEN,"HYPNOTIC, SEXY, ORIGINAL, COOL, & SATISFYING... PERFECT FOR A COCKTAIL SUMMER AFTERNOON!"
5,Enter Mystery,"I was looking to order some Brazilian music; and, through inadvertence I ordered The Brazilian Girls. Imagine my surprise when I heard the 1st cut. Was that the same voice that appears on the CD ""Dirty Child""? I could swear that Sabina Sciubba and Rosy are one in the same. No two women could have the same sexy, sultry, intriguing voice. It is also interesting to note (even though Sabina is cleverly shrouded) the similarity between the two women's facial features: same mouth, same nose. To top it off, both women wrote most of the music on both CDs. But enough of that! I don't want my imagination to detract from the music here. This is a talented group of artists that should appeal to a universal audience. If Sabina's voice doesn't wow you or the accompaniment doesn't slay you, you aren't ready for one very sexy CD. Buy this one; you won't be disappointed."
2,Down to earth good sense,"The is the only book I've seen where somebody admits that character counts in marriage and that love is sustained by working on meaningful projects--like parenting, for example--together. His angle is refreshingly subversive in a culture where most therapists discuss negotiating rights and communication skills. All that is good, but this book brings out the basics that are not fashionable to mention. Dr Fowers is the kind of guy I wish lived nearby; he comes across warm, humble and smart."
3,Home for the Holidays,"This is a lovely book, with pretty pictures, but I did expect a bit more from Hallmark. It's similar content to most Christmas books on the market. No point of difference."
5,Works fine and thanks again !!,Works fine and thanks again !!Uniden DSC-BK 25-Watt Full-Featured Fixed Mount VHF Marine Radio (Black)
4,"So far, so good!","I bought this for a fixed installation in our sailboat. It comes complete with long wires to hook to power/ground, which is nice.It was an easy install and it fired right up.The display is well backlit and easy to read, with large numerals. The user interface is straightforward and easy to use.I will update this review over time to talk about reliability.Nice little radio for the price.Pat RobinsonRanger 32 ""Dulcinea""1/1/2012 Update: I have used this radio for 2 years now. No problems. It just works!"
5,Great value!,"All I can say is this is probably the best value for a DSC unit. It works great, and is very well made. It has a large, clear display and plenty of volume. Adding a flush mount kit will make it look like a professional installation in your console. If you want a radio that is simple to use and has all the safety features, I don't think you can beat the price!"
5,Solara VHF Radion,"Nice compact unit. Comes with easy to use instructions. This is a lot of radio for the money. The scan all channels feature keeps you aware of what's going on around you. Waterproofing allows exposure to the elements. Large LCD display can be seen form a distance, even in bright sunlight. I can find no faults."
4,Rugged and Simple,I installed this radio in a remote area in Fiji as part of a Peace Corps house that my son lives in. It is powered by a car battery that is recharged by a thin film solar array. It draws little power and covers a good portion of the east end of Vanua Levu.
4,Aardvark? hmm . . .,"Church and State is a fascinating introduction to the modern comic book, especially for those who are still expecting tights and superbreath. It is a compellingly complex political intrigue, as Dave Sim constructs his elaborate world in detail in this 3rd installment of his decades long work. Rather than being an illustrated history, the story moves from moments of remember to breathe humour to tenderness to satire to byzantine machinations and back to laughs. I'm especially fond of the end sequence when Cerebus has a cold: one of the chapters is entitled ""na shid hids na fan."" And every once in a while, you have to stop and slap yourself and say, ""hmm . . . it's an aardvark."""
1,Doesn't work,"The Tripp Lite did not work in any way for my use. All that was plugged in was my LCD 32"" TV, cable and DVD. Also unable to return due to hazardous materials....!!"
1,The Tripp Lite doesn't work,"My house uses solar power and the power is inverted into normal 120 volt A/C house current. My inverter is an expensive one that delivers very clean power and is rated at 6000 watts.I have a 12,000 BTU air conditioner that runs on 120 volts that every time the compressor kicks on it makes my computer reset off and on. I'm either getting a voltage spike or brownout from the surge. The air conditioner is on it's own electrical branch separate from my computer.I bought this 600 watt Tripp Lite voltage regulator because it's suppose to be able to correct these kinds of problems but it has no effect. As soon as my air conditioner kicks on the Tripp Lite clicks and flashes it's lights like it's functioning but my computer still crashes. I have two computers and they both have the same problem. It appears the Tripp Lite is not fast or strong enough to make any difference. Very disappointing!"
4,Fun to read,"I just read this book last night, and even thou I have read more elaborated versions on some of the stories in other books earlier, I came across a few that I haven't seen before. And the is also a few of the pranks played ut the British version of Candid Camera in the 60ties. I liked the book."
1,Cheap and Annoying,"I broke most of them trying to get them to stay on my speaker cables, because they would slip off if not crimped hard enough. Save your money, and buy better connectors or just use the bare wire."
2,Not so impressive,"I bought these speaker connectors to use on the Monster brand THX speaker wires. The crimpable gold connectors are ok, however, the rubber cover sleeve is average at best. What I can't understand is the amount of loose-ness of the rubber sleeves when they are designed to stretch to fit almost any thickness speaker wire. Thus, the rubber sleeves on my Monster brand 16-gauge (standard thickness) speaker wires are very loose making me concerned that the exposed speaker wire will corrode over time due to the exposure to air caused by the loose rubber sleeves. I can't believe Monster didn't design the opening of these sleeves to be narrower so that the rubber can stretch a little and form a tight fit with the speaker wires."
3,They do what they're supposed to do,"I rearranged my entire living room, rewiring everything and mounting the tv, speakers, etc. These pins were a help, but a bit bulky, and the rubber grommets did nothing. They are perfect for 16ga wire, probably too small for 14ga or anything larger. The pins are strong, yet I needed to bend them to fit them into the receiver. One almost snapped, and the package only comes with 20 pins, so if you are installing a 5.1 surround system and one breaks, you would need another package. But they work, and the speakers seem to sound a little clearer with them attached. Just don't break one."
3,Puny Monster,These pins are adequate only for lower power connections - those using #12 AWG and smaller wire sizes. The barrel into which the wire is inserted for crimping is too small to accommodate #10 Monster Cable.
1,Low end,You get what you pay for. Needless to say I didn't get much. These are made for low end small gauge wires for equiptment that is of the same calibur. Oh well.
4,Quality Conections,"Easly crimps to wires, using plyers.wont pull out of terminals as easy as a bare wire. The only impovement would be if they could have added an extra terminal or two incase you mess one up ,if the wire slips out while your crimping it theres no saving it."
1,I didn't even use them I didn't like them that much,Monster Cable THX-GP 20-Pack Standard THX-Certified Gold-Plated Speaker ConnectorsThe idea that is covered by this product is a good one but this product in my mind is not the way to do it. The Monster Cable label very conveniently doesn't explain how the connectors are attached to the speaker wire. I checked every conceivable place I could think of. I even wrote a nasty email to the Monster Cable support desk and it took two months to get a reply telling me that you are to crimp these small clips on to your speaker wire with a 16 gage crimping tool that not but a very few people would own. I mean if they would have let me know this from start I probably would have been alright with it but the way they deliberately covered up the problem really pissed me off.
2,Did not care much for this item,"The crimp on connectors are very hard to use and not what I really thought I was getting when I ordered them. Ok, if I owned the crimping tool that is made for them, I suppose they might be easier to use, but I don't really think so. The rubber/plastic wire guards do not stay in place either. The only good part about this item is that it takes up very little space in use. Otherwise, I don't like them at all."
3,Make Sure You Have a Crimping Tool,"Ordered these hoping they would help with speaker wire connections and make life a little easier. However, they require some type of crimping tool which I do not have. You may want to consider other speaker wire options if you don't have a crimping tool."
5,Very Solid Record,"Each of the first four tracks was originally one side of a 2-LP set, circa 1972. Each of them is a fine musical piece too. Everything that was to make Fela great is here in some form, great strong rhythms, bouncing bass, great arranged horn parts, clever vocals. Great record, augmented by two previously unreleased tracks from the same period."
3,Its Okay,"Even at only $5 this seems overpriced. That is true for any Shure brand accessory. It fits very tight which should help noise from the foam slipping. It is so tight though, that it takes some work to get it on and off. I would have been better off buying their more expensive windscreen with the metal collar and set screw."
4,Denso a/c compressor,This was a great fit and I had no issues when doing the install and so far thecompressor is doing fine. Thanks it's a great product.
2,Nothing New about Owen Barfield,"Brief and vapid survey of some Barfield's books. It equips an idle reader with required information about this author. You need not read anything written by Barfield... If you await Gareth Knight, ""one of today's most influential writers on the Quabalah and Western Mystery Tradition"", comes with stunning interpretaion of Barfield, you will be disappointed."
3,Warning,"Just an FYI, this is a guitar tab book, not the piano book. I accidentally ordered this thinking it was the piano/vocals book."
2,Return the Returnees,"I agree with the other reviewer that this movie had potential, but sadly went nowhere. Absolutely nothing happened. No one questioned what was going on. There were no real conflicts. Then it was over. You might try to ponder the question of whether some of us are alive but not really living, but thats a stretch not implied by the movie. I gave it 2 stars, because it was well made and had a nice eerie feel to it and good visual images, but it should never have been made. It is a waste of film and your time."
1,Cheap thin plastic junk,"Bought this based on only 4 mixed reviews. Looks like something youd find at the dollar store for $2. Do yourself a favor and get a quality lantern,a coleman or something. I was almost relieved when it did not work right out of the box with 4 newly purchased batteries.I will be returning it immediately.Even if it did work, its so flimsy and poorly made im sure it would have fallen apart on the first camping trip. This is the first item im haveing to send back to amazon,process is pretty simple so far."
1,piece of junk,I have received this item broken. Supporting vertical wires were out of base and top . Couldn't put it back . Quality or materials poor.
3,Journey's Edge Dual Powered LED Lantern,"Gives adequate light, although I wish it was brighter. Also, on one of the units I bought the main switch fell off early. I was able to get it back on but the units look like extra care will be needed. The 3 stars is somewhat for the brightness but mainly for the construction."
1,Journey's Edge Dual Powered LED Lantern,I tried to contact the seller concerning the non working product as soon as I received it. It took over a week to be contacted after I finally wrote to Amazon. The lantern didn't work and they want me to pay shipping to return a $13.49 purchase. The company to be aware of is Overstock Toyz and Shop72.com. A match would provide more light that the lanten. It really is a piece of junk.Lessoned learned I'm out the bucks!
1,TERRIBLE - BBB grade is an F!,"I just got done filing a complaint to the BBB in Illinois. This lamp is a complete piece of junk. It didn't even work! I called the company and they didn't do anything about it. I received this lamp as a gift and the gifter didn't have the receipt, but we tried to explain that to the supervisor at MTG Inc. the distributor and they literally hung up on me. If the BBB grade is an F and I got hung up on by the SUPERVISOR - no wonder this product is now down to clearance price of $8.00 - DO NOT BUY!!"
2,Was working on a legacy PCMCIA driver...,"This book is filled with errors, is hard to follow, and generally incomplete. However, with some effort, I was able to use the book, the best available, to complete the project. Glad I won't be needing it again though."
3,"A useful source, but far short of what it could be","The big problem with Chockstone/Falcon's ""How to rock climb"" series is that too many of their books, particularly those written by John Long, seem to contain huge sections cut-and-pasted from other titles in this series.Alas, ""Climbing Anchors"" is no exception. If you have a copy of the book ""How To Rock Climb"", you already have about 50% of the matter covered in this book. What remains is useful, but hardly justifies the cost of a full book.If this book contained a section on setting up pulley systems, it might be more worthwhile."
5,Essential reading for trad climbing/natural anchor setup,"This book is extremely valuable for learning how to place protection or setting up anchors for trad climbing or top rope anchor setup. My friends and I carefully studied this book and went out and practiced placing gear and setting up anchors from the ground. When we went and took an anchor building class, we learned a lot of good tips, but the information we learned from this book helped us rapidly advance in our class. This book also is very helpful after you learn your basics because you can analyze various anchor setups and compare it to the analysis in the book. One drawback of this or any other book is that a picture is never as good as inspecting protection on your own at various angles close up. For this reason, you will want to go climbing with a more experienced partner or an instructor so they can give you more detailed feedback on your own protection placement skills."
4,Very good on gear placements; somewhat confusing elsewhere,"The first half of this book, which discusses protection and placements, is invaluable. However, when Long turns to complete anchors, the text becomes somewhat confusing. The section on opposing nuts using clove hitches, for example, may befuddle the beginner. The anchor analysis section is great in theory, but the black and white pictures are a little blurry and hard to see. Nevertheless, this is a very useful reference work."
5,Perfect guide for anchoring systems that will save your life,"In this day and age of punk kids, raiding the rocks and getting vertical with an attitude of ""well I've seen Cliffhanger, let's go"", this book offers a sensible if not manditory alternative. Climbing Anchors is what every aspiring climber needs to read to obtain the theoretical know-how of every anchoring system. If you are new to rock climbing, it is nearly your responsibility to read this book to develop an appreciation and understanding of all the mechanics and forces involved in the sport. Heed this advice and you'll stay alive while having fun. This is the best book of John Long's How to Rock Climb series."
1,I got took!,"I too was deceived by the hype. Don't waste your money (like I did)! If I could give less than 1 star, I would."
1,Too many typos - so ANNOYING!,"I've read the other reviews - everyone has valid viewpoints. Yes, it is a decent story. Yes, it is good to support young, first-time novelists. But does this mean you pay money to get a book FULL (and I mean FULL - eg.first 7 pages, 19 spelling errors and typos alone) of grammatical errors? When I buy a book, I expect that all I need do is focus on the story. However, with this book, you are constantly distracted, and disappointed by the errors. A simple 5 hour proof reading session would have surely removed most of the problems - it's pure laziness on the part of the author and unforunately, many won't be tempted to read him again. A real shame to shoot yourself in the foot like this. The irony is if you have a look at his book publisher's website, they actually offer an editing service. It is clear he did not bother to do this."
5,Just a good thriller.,"Many people seem to think this book is somehowlike the ""Da Vinci Code"", it is way better thenthat! I liked how the plot moved through viewpointsof many characters, and the time frame went inunison with the peoples story."
1,"disagree,disagree,disagree","I wrote my review and it was taken off the site. Why....because it disagrees with everyone.? Hardships of self-published books aside there are reasons why I didn't give this book more than one star. I noted that the plot was excellent. Other than that it was not well written, the characters were not believable and it was confusing. That's my opinion and that's what reviews are for.....opinion. The misspellings and typos were totallly distracting. I understand it was self done but to continually confuse ""there"" and ""their"" is not forgivable in my eyes. Sorry ! Have noticed the ""fake"" reviews such as ""superdad"" and ""deadcuz"" who both use the same idiosyncracy of ""?"" instead of an apostrophe. Coincidence? I think not!"
1,This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors!,"After reading the 6 reviews on this book, all giving it 5 stars, I decided to buy it. However, when I received it, I was very disappointed. There are spelling and grammatical errors on almost every page. I tried to ignore them, but there were too many. After reading the first four chapters, I gave up and quit reading it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone without it first undergoing a thorough editting."
2,Insulted by unethical marketing strategy,"Besides the numerous typos on every page (which I ""no"" are ""to"" numerous to mention) the writing is immature, the plot transparent, and the style, well, what style?!This might have scored a B- as a high school essay. It is in a different league from The Da Vinci Code, contrary to the hype the author or his pawns placed in the book reviews there. I am insulted by the author's unethical marketing strategy. He got my $6 bucks (for the digital edition) but that was a complete waste of money. If I were Amazon I would penalize the author by banning this book from the site."
1,Major Disappointment,"I bought this book on recommendations from others on Amazon. Usually, the reviews are on target. Here, they failed miserably. This would be a good book were it not replete with errors. The Black Coats took ""there"" guns, etc., throughout the entire book. At least the pain was diminished due to the fact that book was only 155 pages. The story was decent and the writer does have talent. But this book appears as if a rough draft was published without any revisions."
3,"Good, but not great.","The plot was great, the characters are good, the story was a bit confusing at times, and the suspence was intense. As far as the last person saying you're review was deleted, I would take that up with Amazon, cause they are the sole owners of a review as soon as it is submitted, and I don't think they did it cause you gave the book one star, you probably made them mad some other way. This book is a great read if you want something different, but for those of you that want something outstanding, this is not it, buy this book with an open mind"
1,Don't fall for the fake reviews!!!,"I too fell for all of the fake reviews. I can usually overlook grammer/spelling/syntax problems, but this was the worst book I've ever read in that respect! The book was very short; normally, that's a bad thing, but in this case, it was a relief! The plot was confusing and very uninteresting. My recommendation is that you ignore the fake reviews and listen to the rest."
5,Wonderful Historical Entertainment!,"This CD about Harriett Tubman is a wonderful way for anyone to acquaint themselves with this important American sheroe. Ms. Tubman's life and activities in leading the freedom movement of former African slaves is inspirational for all Americans and other freedom-loving and freedom-seeking peoples. As a Harvard degree-holder in Afro-American Studies, I am always looking for creative ventures, such as this CD by reknown actress Gwendolyn Briley-Strand, to share historical accounts to a media-driven world. This CD is helpful especially to educate youth. It will be useful to educators, as well, during February Black History Month. Take a listen!"
5,Wonderful Christmas music!!,"This Christmas music will make people happy all over the world. It's perfect for holiday parties, music for your car, and special gifts for loved ones!"
3,Don't buy unless you're replacing old ones...,"I bought these by accident thinking they were component cables which can't be found anywhere (not even through MonsterCables.com). I paid $20 to get mine brand new. That was about $15 more than they are worth. There is absolutely no difference between the image quality for these and Nintendo's stock composite cables. Although, the Monster Cables do feel considerably more durable.But, I can't stress enough, if you are looking to upgrade the image on your Gamecube, DO NOT buy these cables. You'll be wasting your money."
3,"Most of the info is good, but some is dead wrong","This book has some interesting and some good holistic advice and information, however, some of it is very wrong and could provide itself to be deadly to your cat. This book has a number of recepies for you to cook for your cat, and some of them, to my horror, called for Onion. Onion, as we know, can be deadly to cats, even in very small amounts. However, onion aside, most of the rest of the book was very interesting and helpful. Also just be aware that this book was published in England, so it calls for ingredients and products that Americans don't have easy access to."
5,Must Buy!!!!,"My professor wrote this book. She poured he heart into help people finding there personality type, strengthens and interest, so they could find there career path. The book helps you map you goals, as well. Even if you have your career in mind, this book can help you go to the next level in your career for personal growth."
5,Roomates CD is Great,Really like this CD....I have been listening to it over and over for the past couple weeks.
4,Does the job but very $$$,"It's a costly add-on that IMHO should be already included with all compatible cameras, but it does what it's designed to."
5,Outstanding (and now with a sad epilogue),"It's amazing: this one courageous woman who simply stood up for her beliefs on December 1, 1955 started one of the largest and most influential civil rights movements in history. This book truly reflects Ms. Parks' in her 'essence.' It is a small collection of her thoughts and experiences. Yet these thoughts convey a very personal and profound impact on anyone reading and meditating on them.What is sad (as I have noted in my title) is the fact that Ms. Parks recently passed away at age 92, just 9 days before I worte this; her funeral was held today in Detroit. May she rest in peace."
2,Rosa was better than this book..,"A little too quiet. There were some nice insights into an amazing and wonderful woman, but they are scant."
4,very readable,"The reader will come away with a good grasp of the major events of the conflict. There are times when youhave to flip back to a previous section as the book jumps around a bit, but overall a very readable short history."
1,poorly made,Broke after a year of usage. The retractable prongs wouldn't stay up. The switch that controls retractable prongs broke and the whole thing was useless.
3,"not bad, not great","I really dig the compact design on this surge protector, it works great and I like the LEDs that check for ground and protective state. The downside however is the construction is a bit sub par. The retracting prongs are a neat idea but they are a pain to extend and then they colpase when you are trying to plug the unit into the wall a lot, this is also where I see the biggest point of failure since I am not impressed with how sturdy the sliding mechanism is and am kind of expecting it to break eventually. The plugs on the sides are a bit difficult to get cords plugged into, as the holes don't line up with the channels inside the unit very well and it takes a bit of jimmying usually. I'd recommend one of the belkin products over this IMHO, but as of now it is doing the job it was designed to do."
4,Review on Tripp Lite Traveler,Excellent Surge Suppressor for a laptop but too large to use inside a travel bag. I wish someone would make a surge suppressor that is the same size or even larger but much thinner so it can fit better inside a travel bag.
4,Good Value,"The surge supressor works as defined, but could use a little more work on the plug slider. It fits perfect in my laptop case."
2,The piece was defected,I purchased this item from Office depot. My item was defected piece which I returned. It cost me around 10$ on shipping (both ways).
1,Be careful!,"The product doesn't have any voltage compatability ratings on the product itself or accompanying literature that I could find. On the web site, however, it shows the voltage compatability at 120 VAC. The product should therefore not be used overseas in countries where the voltage is 220 VAC."
4,Tripp Lite Traveler surge protector,"Tripp Lite Traveler. This product was recommended by a geek friend. Love the compact size , so easy to travel with. The only problem is it is difficult to push out the plug prongs. Needs a little bit of strength . Brought one for my Dad as a Christmas present."
4,Cracking the Zero Mystery,"This book is a soft cover production, and explains how the United States Navy recovered a downed Japanese Zero fighter plane in the Alaskan theater near Dutch Harbor. The Zero was nearly intact. It was then shipped on a Navy transport ship to the US Navy base at North Island, San Diego. There the Zero was restored to flying condition in about six weeks, and was test flown to determine its combat performance characteristics. Most importantly, it was subsequently flown in mock air combat against US fighter planes. These tests allowed the US military air arms to properly fight the Zero and win. Prior to capturing the Zero specimen, the Zero proved to be a superior fighter in the early stages of WWII in the Pacific. Using tactics developed during the mock combat sessions, and the emergence of newer Navy fight planes such as the Grumman Hellcat and the Chance-Vought Corsair, the Zero was decisively defeated in later air battles. This short book describes this story quite well."
5,RAW is 10 Jesus all by himself,"This thunderbolt of a tape was once entitled the Jumping Jesus Syndrome, due to Wilson's clever coinage of a leap in human intellect equating to ""1 Jesus"". Others have called this everything from the ""Quickening"" to ""the Omega Point"" to Terence McKenna's ""uploaded self into the multiplicitous realm of the Other"". Bob, as ever, doesn't say much about what it is, but rather what it seems to him to be in all its facets, these ""fast times"" we live in, and how intelligence seems to be increasing and time with it. Is it really? He reports from the edge. Brilliant, hilarious and convention-shattering."
2,Not what you'd expect from Lexicon - Bad Reverb Period,"Well, it was fun while it lasted, I had it all hooked up with USB going into my DAW recording program. I was running it as a VST/AU inside ableton, with digital sends going in/out of ableton/ my sound card.By the way, I just loved it when I'd type ""SLAP MY BITCH"" into the computer VST when prompted to ""save reverb program"" and it would print out on the Lexicon LCD screen!Well, after a few weeks, I really started wondering where was that BIG SOUND?? Maybe I missed some presets or something....no....actually all the presets sounded the same, like a cheap dirty tin can. I can only think that MX400 uses one reverb algorithm, not 17 (and a cheezy one at that!):HALL, ROOM, GATE....all the same dang tinny mcdonalds restroom sound).Save your money and get some beer and a hooker instead."
3,Works but gets lost on reboot,On a Dell desktop running XP this drive installed and ran with no problem but when the PC was rebooted it was necessary to power down and up the drive separately for it to be seen by the PC. Simpletech service said this was to be expected.Other external drives don't need this extra step and it means the drive shares are lost if it's on a network.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought this hard drive as my main storage source to carry all of my media (~100 movies, ~8000 songs) as well as thousands of photos from trips around the world. The Hard drive died upon start up the day I returned from a trip. After taking it to three different data recovery specialists, they all tell me that what I need is a ""Clean Room"" if there's any way for recovery. Clean room recovery costs anywhere between $700 and $4000!Do your research!!!Simpletech is just a brand name; the company that actually makes the hard drives is Hitachi, the hard drive itself is Deskstar (aka ""Deathstar"") which is (I've discovered) known for these types of failures.Bottom line, you get what you pay for (once again). If you're still going to decide to buy this hard drive, and your data has any value to you at all, buy a second hard drive of a different brand and keep all valuable data on it as back up... come to think of it, a secondary back up of valuable data is a great idea no matter what!"
1,Died right after the warranty did,"This product worked flawlessly for 13 months, then the drive crashed with all of my back-up data on it. While hard drives will eventually all wear out, 13 months is a premature death, and their ""customer service"" is non-existant. Buyer beware!"
5,Exceptional amount of detail,"I've been teaching Microsoft operating systems for 14 years and I've used all of the MSPress books, or almost. This is an exceptional book for the ease of the explanations and the step-by-step details provided. Northrup and Thomas explain exactly why you want to do something, then they tell you how to do it. They have step-by-step procedures for configuring a computer individually, using Active Directory, or editing the registy. The thing that I love the best is that they don't assume any prior knowledge of the product like many technical books do. They define each and every term that they use. I hope that this book, and others like it, set a new standard on technical writing."
5,The BEST TRAINING KIT.,"People interested in buying this book must know it is out of date. It was released in the age of Windows Server 2003, without service pack one. So it does not cover WSUS, but SUS. It also does not contain information about SP1 improvements and now SP2, however, it is a book about planning and implementing security strategies, which makes it a book above the time.If you have money and are interest in security, or if you are intended to pass the exam, buy this book.The text is clear and comprehensive. The content is pretty amazing which demonstrates de knowledgement of the author about what he writes. Such knowledgement is provenient from his experience working with Windows in exposed environments.This is not only a theoretical guide of security, but also a practical one. The excercises hep you to understand and record it in your mind.Finally, buy this book."
4,Great CD for kids,"I first used this CD with my children over a decade ago. We'd play it and sing along to it all the time. Now, I purchase it to have for my grandchildren and as gifts for new mothers. Joanie Bartels has a great talent for children's music. Highly recommend all of her CDs."
2,OMIT NAME GAME & THIS WOULD BE OK,"Ever since I was a very little child, I have detested ""the Name Game."" It is idiotic, annoying and has nothing to recommend it.I also disliked the ""Super..."" from Mary Poppins. It does sound atrocious and these two have cost this 3 stars."
5,Mississippi is Alive in Here,"Fans of Blue Mountain won't be disappointed in this CD. Cary has stepped it up a notch, and turned up the distortion a bit, but his old time country and blues background are still here. The guy can flat out play some mean guitar, and also write a great song. If you can catch Cary live, don't miss it. He is a treasure who needs to get the recognition he deserves."
5,Wore Out the First One!,This is a great tape when you put a little one to sleep. It is so soothing and relaxing. I have been playing this tape every night for the past five years. It has become apart of our evening routine. Now five years later the tape is worn out by use and I'm ordering my second tape. I'm even thinking of buying two because I'd like to give it to my child when he has a baby of his own.
4,Very nice.,"I like this CD and I'm glad that I bought it. If you want a collection of different lullabies, then I would recommend it. However, if you only can afford one lullaby CD, buy ""A Child's Gift of Lullabies"" by Tanya Goodman Sykes. It's the best that I've found so far."
4,Almost as good as Lulaby Magic II!,"I, too, wish you would carry Lullaby Magic II. Both are quiet and relaxing. A nightly ritual in our house include one of these two tapes."
4,"good but not as good as ""Lullabye Magic II""","I was looking for Joanie Bartels ""Lullabye Magic II"" (2nd version of lullabye music) with different songs which I think is even better than the original- but I don't see Lullabye Magic II on your list to order however. I can only find it in stores on tape and thought I would try to find it on CD through Amazon- would recommend that it be added to your list! Please let me know if you add it at some point."
2,"Does Not Fit ""All"" Upright Exercise Bikes as Claimed","My upright execise bike as a post with a 3-cornered plate that screws into the seat. This seat has the same hardware as a street bike; I bought it becasue it said it fits all and it does not. So if you have an exercise bike that uses a normal street bike seat, you will love this seat, it is large and cushy and otherwise an ideal seat for sitting for a long time."
5,The BEST Book For Children's Birthday Cakes,"This book is a 5-star book because of all the absolutely beautiful and very creative instructions for how to make the most beautiful birthday cakes and other party food for children. Food is usually the center of a party, and this one has amazing instructions of hwo to turn ordinary jello into a boat with a sail or make a sandwhich house complete with carrot windows and doors, a castle cake, dinosaur cake, whale cake, bus cake, etc.. All the instructions are here to guide you to making a party filled with very creative themed food. Great Book!!"
5,Learned insights,"Yehudah Levi received his Ph.D. from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and rabbinic ordination from Rabbis Y.Hutner and J.Breuer. He has been president in both Israel and America of the Orthodox Jewish Scientists. He has published many articles and books on scientific subjects, and in Israel set up the Physics/ Electro Optics Department at the Jerusalem College of Technology. In this work he looks into the scientific world of the sages from the perspective of one who has a real grasp both of Torah and of modern scientific learning. This work should be of great value for all truth- seekers who care very much about the relation of Torah and Science."
2,"Bought this kit because of the cute, small case shown in the photo. DOESNT COME WITH CASE SHOWN... grooming tools OK","The grooming tools are OK... Like any others you find at target, walmart, etc.... but I wanted THIS specific grooming kit because of the cute case in the photo. I thought it would fit perfectly in my jujube diaper bag pocket. Long story short, it does not come with the shown case. It comes with a large, flat square clear case (nothing you would use for keeping the grooming tools... just a throw away case).I kept it because I needed to use it but wouldn't buy it again or for anyone else."
2,Nail Scissors...,"We bought this set solely for the nail scissors, which are very useful. They are easy to use, and I never had to worry about cutting too deep, which was always a fear with the nail clippers. I wish that the scissors were sold separately because we have not used anything else in the packet."
4,Gato's sounds are timeless,"This collection is great to listen to any time of the day. Oftentimes I find some jazz too heavy to listen to in the morning, but the tracks from this collection are a wonderful way to begin your morning and equally enjoyable as a way to mellow out at the end of the day."
5,Antietam: The Lost Command,"The company name(Sound Mind Theater) says it all! ""Antietam: The Lost Command"" is an excellant production which is driven by penetrating sound effects, high quality scripting and voice talent.If you are looking for a return to old time radio suspense without all the static and commercials, this is it. Your imagination will be spell bound as this audio unfolds. The sharpness of effects creates fertile images for the mind to see.Mr. Davis, producer has given us an opportunity to revisit yester-year with modern compact disk technology. This medium and historically based fiction is also ideal for educational groups, Civil War buffs/groups and even local theater production.Thanks for the innovation...Joe F. Head Dean of Enrollment Services Kennesaw State University Georgia."
5,dvd,"i ordered this for a neighbor, i havent watched it.. but it arrived promptly.. he was happy with it.i guess thats what matters.."
2,MSI dvd,"if you have an old crappy tv and 20 dollars you wont miss this dvd is for you! very poor quailty. its good but i mean sooo poorly made it hurts to know i spent money on it. Don't buy this dvd go to youtube and watch the videos on there, it's about the same quailty. pixelated so badly through out the performence it makes it hard and not as fun to watch. save your money, go see them live and spit on the the band."
2,clock evaluation,"The product arrived on time and was well wrapped. It had a warbled, soft voice. It was a talking watch. Thanks for listening."
2,USB Combat Stick,I have not had great success with this joystick yet. I am a MAC user and trying to play Flyboys. The major problem is that I can not get the sensitivity adjusted to a usable point. It is either so sensitive that a slight twitch in my hand sends the control to the max. Or it is so non-responsive that I move the stick half way to the limit before it starts to move the indicator and then when it does move it jumps to the max. I have not completely given up yet and will keep playing with it.
2,no feeling,This joystick has no feel. The horizontal and vertical trim wheels are a joke at best. I had a Microsoft Sidewinder that was far superior. This joystick has a very plastic feel more of a toy than a real sim stick. It sets up easy and is ready to fly in no time but the lack of feel is disturbing.
4,Ayres Creates a Great Swampy Mystery,"E.C. Ayres creates a wonderful setting of swampy Florida and his characters fit right in. The cast of Lowell and Bedrosin are so opposite that they mesh well into a great mystery.Note: ALMOST ANY BOOK THAT WINS THE PWA/ST. MARTINS PRESS BEST FIRST PRIVATE EYE NOVEL CONTEST IS A SURE BET--Les Roberts(An Infanate Number of Monkeys), and Steve Hamilton(A Cold Day In Paradise)."
3,So so...,"This remote is too big to be used on a key chain, and too small to leave in the car. But the worse part of it is the vague feel of the buttons. There is no click or any positive feel when the button is pushed. It does open and close the garage door though."
3,Works great but paperwork included didn't match remote,"The remote we received must have been updated since the documentation was written, as it had a different type of battery inside than what the documentation noted. I ended up looking for and buying batteries that I didn't need, and likely won't have a use for in the future. The remote does work with our garage door opener, so the product itself is fine."
3,OK But not as good as the older model,Item works great but my origianl one worked at a longer distance and the response was faster.Great for the price anyway
1,not very reliable,"I brought this in Dec 2009, it worked for about 8 months then it started to not working. I changed new batteries twice and still nothing works. I never dropped it and it is only use twice a day. It is a disappointment and it is now sitting on the table doing nothing. I don't recommend this at all."
4,Good enough,"This remote control worked the first time I programmed the receiver for it. It worked with a bit of delay but not enough to complain about. The included coin cell battery CR2032 went dead after a few uses and had to be replaced. Replacement was difficult in that the metal clip must be removed to allow access to the Philips screw which holds the case together. Even though the case looks the same as the older model, the circuit board is different. After the battery was replaced, the remote worked again. For the price, I consider this satisfactory."
5,Perfect!,"I read all of the comments here about the battery being dead on arrival and how painful the changing process was, but I took a chance and ordered this product anyway.Shipping was fast, opened the box, pressed the ""learn"" button on the door receiver, pressed the button on the remote, and that was it. It worked straight away!I did look inside the unit and the circle battery does look like it will be a bit tricky to replace, when the time comes, but it's doable. A small price to pay for a deal like this.There is a slight lag with opening/closing the door when using this remote, compared to the original one I had, but it is less than 1 second. That's not a big deal for me. The range was fine as well.Highly recommend this remote to anyone thinking of buying it. The price is great and it works without any hassle."
5,Genie Garage Remote,"This is the second one I have purchased as we needed more. Could not be happier!!!Easy to program, small, perfect for our family."
1,Quit working right after return time ended.,"I purchased my replacement Genie opener from Sanford and Son based on all the great reviews. It worked perfectly at first, but quit working after only a few months. Of course, this was just past the return period so now I'm in the same boat I was a few months ago facing yet another purchase of an opener."
5,Works great w/ idiot proof programming...,"I got this remote for my Overhead System, which the remotes for it are terrible! It took literally 60 seconds to program the 2 new replacement Genie remotes. Climb up so you can find a certain button on your opener, called the ""learn code button"" (I told you it's idiot proof) press it once, press your new garage remote once then click it a second time, repeat with the other remote, boom...you're done. Simple and they've been working just fine. Directions also came in the box. They're not really sturdy so I won't be surprise if wear and tear gets to them. But we'll have to see. Overall: cheap,simple, effective. I got mine from Sanford & Sons w/ lightning fast shipping and don't know if it's standard but both remotes came with batteries installed."
5,Works great for me!,"I ordered this when the soft, spongy button on our original opener finally gave out. Out of the box it took about five minutes to ""program"" to our opener, and most of that time was getting the ladder out. The ""program"" process took twice to work, but it was quick and easy and totally painless. A BONUS: the center button is now hard plastic! I have just finished an order for a second remote for our other car."
5,Very easy to use -- quick setup,"Didn't take more than a few minutes to get this remote programmed and working with my door. Sleek, newer design looks great in the car too... :)no problems whatsoever..."
4,they are great,The delivery was fast that is good but the genie remote I order was a difference one front the one I gotand that is not good. Over all they are great
1,Bad luck???,"I promise I'm not posting a ""rant"" here; I just have had horrible luck with this transmitter (and receiver). Do yourself a favor, and get the Chamberlain system -- it is much more reliable, has the same security, and you don't get the range restrictions that the Genie systems have.I got to the point (after replacing the receiver and 3 transmitters) that I had to get out of my car, and walk up to the windows on the garage door to get the thing to respond at all. Even then it was a 10% chance that the door would open.Congratulations Genie, your Intellicode system works well -- so well that the consumer can't even open their own garage door..."
4,Good Opener,I notice a slight delay from the original but i can live with itif the opener does not work then change the battery which is what i had to do
1,Clicker,"Received the remote & programmed it. Worked a few times & quit functioning. Battery tested fine. Faulty unit, returned for refund. Purchased a Chamberlain universal & it works great!"
4,Great Replacement Remote,"This is a ""factory replacement remote"" that works. Day to day use of this product means that it has to be dependable and it is. My wife is a happy camper and that makes me smile."
4,Easy to program,"Hard to find remote in stores,not compatible with older models. This remote is easy to program and easy to use.A+ rating."
5,genie remotes,"i could not believe how fast my 2 remotes got to me ordered 7/2 received 7/6 they were new in box well packed and ready for use 2 minutes to program opener and was good to go, checked range and it was better than 300 feet i'm very pleased one of the easiest tranactions i have made"
2,"Works OK, but cheap design","I've used these remotes for 7 years, only problem I've had is the battery contact bent so that it didn't contact the battery, but this is easy to fix - all you have to do is bend the metal. In general, the remote is very cheaply designed, all the parts including the external plastic and rubber button are ridiculously cheap. I tried to use the better designed Chamberlain remote, but it won't work with the Genie, different frequency."
5,over price on shipping and handling!,"I order two Genie GIT-1BL remote control. It only took me a few minutes to set and operate the control. They both work perfectly....My only beef is when I chose the shipping and handling to arrive in 2 days. Aspdoor and A Whole lot more charge me $11.23, I was expecting UPS or FedEX but to my surprise it was sent to me by the USPS (Prority Service)... I Like the USPS. But I know that the USPS will charge you only $2.95 for this service and will even give you the Free envelope for the tow remote and come pick up the item for Free.... MY only problem is that I was overcharge for the shipping and handling of this product."
3,Works fine,The 3 stars are for the seller. The unit works but the packaging was cheap and the shipping was slow.
2,Works Until it Breaks,"This is the third time we've had to replace the garage door opener. After the first time it broke, Genie sent us a replacement and all we had to pay was the shipping. That one broke almost immediately, and so far, the most recent one purchased through Amazon is still working."
5,garage door handy,"smaller than i was expecting, much more sensitive button, don't have to press as hard. the range isn't too bad either."
2,Works ok but cheap,Received two of these remotes with my Genie Excelerator garage door opener purchased from Home Depot. The remotes range is very short and the plastic clip holder does not hold the remote any longer - falls out. Very cheaply made and is disappointing since it would have been so easy to design this right to begin with. Makes you wonder if Genie put a similar lack of integrity into the opener itself.
5,Easy to use,This universal remote control was very easy to get working by following the instructions included with the remote. My garage door opener is a Genie so I am not sure how well this remote would work with other brand openers.
4,As advertised,Product was the same as the one I've had for 10 years. Very dependable. But my local hardware store wanted TWICE the price I paid for the identical item.
3,Came with a dead battery.,"When a neighbor of mine paid more then 30 for his remote at a local hardware store, i knew amazon would give the better deal. Sure enough i found this one for less the $20. As soon as it came i was baffled on why it wouldn't work so when i opened it i saw that it had a battery. So after many attempts i gave in and went out in town and bought the battery. Unlike the old remote where it took the tiny version of a AA, this one took a 2032 and i had to remove the case to get to it, the whole time i was thinking all this B.S. for a remote. It works now flawlessly but it would of been nice if they but a charged battery."
4,Overhead Door garage door opener,The opener was purchased to be used with a Overhead Door (Legacy) garage door opener. It works perfect and I saved money.
5,Perfect Replacement,"Got these to replace the factory grips that were in pretty bad shape, have Hogue grips on some of my other guns and they sure are nice.Highly recomend them to anyone wanting a good grip."
4,Did the trick,"We purchased this product for a 3-week trip to Europe (planes, trains, and automobiles), and were happy and relieved to have it. We were looking for something that we could strap on and off quickly and that would leave us with free hands to pull suitcases and push a stroller around airports and train stations (where trolleys are not always available). One advantage is that we were able to keep the pac back attached to the car seat through the airport x-ray machines. Of course, there's no comfortable way to carry a bulky and heavy car seat:I'm glad my husband did all the carrying."
4,Easy way to get a carseat through the airport,"This is pretty straightforward - $40 seems a bit much for what it is, but it performs its intended function well, and anything that helps you get carseat, stroller, and all the other gear through the airport is much appreciated."
4,Fantastic option for travelling with a child and car set,"We used the Cheeky Monday Pac Back when traveling during the holidays at multiple airports with a toddler, the huge car set, stroller, and all our luggage. We couldn't have done it without this product. We were able to secure our carseat pretty easily and I carried it on my back while pushing the baby in his stroller without any discomfort, while my husband managed all the luggage. Truly a lifesaver.I recommend that you practice securing the carseat and getting it on and off your back a few times, so you don't struggle when it's ""go-time"" at the airport."
3,"Suits its purpose, low quality","I purchased this Pac Back for a trip to see my husband, who is in the army, in Oklahoma. It worked great and my son's car seat was a convertible seat so I was worried that it wouldn't fit right, but it did. Then I had to go to San Antonio on yet another trip. The stitching all along the shoulder/arm straps became undone. After 2 round trip flights, the Pac Back still works, but it is unsightly.... very poor quality I'd say."
4,It works just as advertised,"The backpack is easy to use and easy to store. The only trouble I had was that the Car Seat sticks out pretty far behind you (farther than usual for a backpack) so I kept bumping into things, or turning around and whacking my Grand Daughter who was standing beside me. It did free up my hands for luggage and her though so I am glad I bought it for our trip."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","The idea of towing the car seat in your back rather than in your arms makes this product very attractive. So, we got it for our Evenflo Triumph a couple of weeks ago. On the good side, it has waist straps and a lumbar pad, so you're not towing the whole awkward weight of the seat in your shoulders. However, the materials and construction are not the best. The first thing we noticed is that the straps that go around your shoulders and waist do not adjust easily, they are made of a coarse material that does not slide through the buckles, so you better take your time to adjust them before leaving home.Durability is a serious concern. Both straps were ripped by the end of the trip. The first one broke when we were leaving the first flight, the second one by the end of the first return flight.In my opinion this ""pac back"" is not worth the trouble. Maybe with better construction... but I'm returning mine and getting a luggage cart for our next trip."
2,Does not work on All car seats,This is a fabulous product and seems well made. It however does not work on ALL CAR SEATS. It does not work on the Maxi Cosi car seats.
3,Works well,"Was useful when traveling solo with my 2 kids and 2 carseats. One carseat was for an infant and could be placed in the stroller. I used the pac back for the second, larger carseat. So one baby and carseat in the stroller and the second carseat on my back while my 2.5 year old toddler walked. Made the airport experience easier. Downside was that it started tearing slightly after 4 flights.No reflection on the product, but if you're carrying a large car seat in the pac back, like I was, you had to walk a very straight line to get down the aisle of the airplane without bumping the seated passengers."
2,Falling apart after one use,"We've used this product once and it's already falling apart and ripping at the seams. My husband said it worked great for the first leg of the trip but by the time he got to his layover, it was no longer useful. We have the Britax Marathon car seat which weighs 17lbs and not the 45lb stated. The idea is fantastic and well worth it...if it works. If my mother-in-law cannot repair it before they return, I plan on seeking a refund."
4,"Great product, but doesn't work with Britax Wizard","The Cheeky Monkey Pac Back is a simple but well-designed and constructed product, but just as an FYI, the vertical strap that goes around the car seat is not long enough when fully extended for the buckles to come together. This is true for the Britax Wizard which has a very high back. It would be great if the company would offer an extension strap that uses their buckles.I would like to mention how excellent is the Amazon customer service, though, because it was so easy to return the item and Amazon paid for the return shipping!"
2,Poor Quality,First day I used this product it was great. Then I used it on my return trip home and the shoulder straps began to tear. Great for one use only! Hoping amazon will give me my money back.
4,Frees up your hands,"Used this on a recent trip - 11 month old had her own seat on the plane so we needed to bring the carseat. It looks kind of silly, but definitely frees up your hands. My husband ""wore"" the carseat, so he had both hands free to help out with the bags, stroller, baby etc. If you need to bring a carseat on the plane with you, I would recommend this."
4,Lightweight & easy to use,"This is actually the second one we purchased. We have loved the ease of use. It is lightweight & comes with a storage bag so you don't have to deal with straps flying around when it isn't in use. Once you have the straps set to your carseat size, they no longer have to be adjusted. I would recommend closing the latches & storing it in the storage bag at all times. One of our latches broke because a large bag was put on an open latch & it broke. I don't think this would have happened with proper storage because the latches are very sturdy."
4,"Lifesaver, but not built to last","Like many others, I had read the reviews and decided to purchase this for my frequent trips with a heavy car seat, stroller, bag, and infant. It is a lifesaver at the airport (unless you have the car seat that converts to a stroller, which I just got from a friend), but doesn't last for many flights. Mine tore after the 2nd set of roundtrips."
5,Very helpful!,"We used the car seat backpack traveling to the airport for Thanksgiving, and we had to take two trains to the airplane. I wouldn't have been able to manage without the car seat backpack freeing up my hands! It is easy to strap in the car seat and does a great job evenly distributing the weight on your back. The only thing it took me a little while to get used to is turning and not hitting people around me, because you have a wider turning radius!"
4,Great While It Lasted,"The Pac Back worked really well when we used it with our Britax Boulevard and really saved me life when I was traveling alone with my toddler. BUT, the strap buckles eventually broke. Granted we took the Pac Back on half a dozen or so flights before it broke, but a more durable product would be nice."
3,"Functional, but not durable","This product was a decent way for me to lug our gigantic carseat through the airports (although my wife was not able to carry it comfortably herself). Before we even got to the gate on our first trip, however, I noticed that the stitching at the top of the straps was coming apart. I am not satisfied with the quality, and this probably would not serve you well if you travel frequently with a carseat."
5,Noticeable improvement in pixel quality.,"Better picture quality on the Gamecube isn't cheap with the going rate of component cables averaging out to around $100. So what would be the next best alternative? I would say the Gamecube S-Video A/V Cable by Monster Cable does the job nice. Definitely improves pixel quality over composite. Yeah you could play your GC games on Wii with component 480p output, but you can't use the GBA Player on the Wii or play online mode in Phantasy Star Online. So if you need better picture quality on your GC, try these cables. These are the best quality S-Video cables you can get for GC and they also work on SNES and N64. [I ordered mine from Classic Game Source Inc as Refurbished and they arrived 3 days later in brand new condition.]"
4,Great product for Nintendo Gamecube,"I've noticed a definite imnprovement in video quality with my Nintendo Gamecube. Only problem is the a/v leads are too short. The inputs on my a/v receiver are spread out too far and I really had to strain the leads to get them to reach. Other than that, this would be a worthy addition to your video gaming collection."
4,"If you can't buy a Component Cable, this it's a good option...","If you don't want to pay about 80 bucks (or more) for one of the dozen of Component Video Cable available in market then this would be your better second option. Of course, if you can get a component cable for GameCube, give thanks to the Lord and use it, but if you are one of the unlucky, like all of us, who had to buy an alternative, you won't be disappointed ... too much."
3,S-Video is over-rated,Picture quality is okay. I can't tell if the picture and sound is really much better through the S-Video and Monster audio than the standard RCA composite plugs.
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a good seafood cookbook that I can use, what I got was a seafood cookbook that is more of a picture, coffee table book. Sure the color photos are beautiful, but many of the ingredients are way too exotic. How often have you seen paw-paws for sale? Do you know what they are? Sure, I may be able to go out in the woods of southern Indiana to get this ""Indiana banana"" when it is in season, but alas, I work full time and get most of my food at a grocery store."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!,Great service! I received my order even faster than expected! Condition of the book great!If I have to order another book I definitively try to purchase it from the same seller!Thank you!
2,Fail,"The mirror was delivered 10 days after the ship date which already put me in a bad mood before opening the box. I was worried about shipping a large mirror, but the packaging looked to be in good condition and I didn't hear anything rattling around.However, when I opened up the box and attempted to lift the mirror out of the box, the frame separated from the glass. The cheap cardboard backing was so thin that the staples (yes, staples) ripped through the cardboard completely.The color of the image on Amazon is misleading. This mirror frame is not as dark as the image suggests. It is more of a dark brown than a cappuccino.I tried to contact the seller first when the item was late and got no response. Then after I took the item out of the box and the mirror separated from the frame I sent another email and got not response. Ultimately, I like the look of the mirror and the size is exactly what I need so I have chosen to have the frame repaired here.Beware."
4,A very moving & honest book!,"As usual, Pramoedya succeeds in giving a very moving and honest portrayal of life in Indonesia. This book evokes emotions deep within one's heart. It brings out one's compassions for the writer, his family, and his fellow prisoners. It also gives a very good description of how successfully had the Soeharto's regime oppressed the minds of Indonesian people. When reading this book, as with reading any of Pramoedya's books, one gets the sense of how passionately he loves Indonesia, how great a hope he has for the country and the people despite of all the atrocious treatments he has received from the government. However, the average readers will need to have a basic knowledge of Indonesian modern history from the year 1945 to be able to better enjoy this book."
1,"Sadly disappointing, borrow it from your library for free.","I enjoy military novels, fiction or non-fiction, so I was very excited to get my hands on this book. Reading this book was a chore. There are six individual stories ""crammed"" into one book. The stories are too condensed and too rushed, they leave the reader with too many questions and not enough feeling. For grit and pain and joy, a book that screams at you and rips you, takes you over, I would suggest ""Jarhead"" by Anthony Swofford."
1,One star is generous.,"I read this book because I was impressed with Black Hawk Down, the book more then the movie. I did not enjoy this book at all. This book doesn't seem complete. I agree with the reviewer who said each story felt rushed. I would have rather had 3/4 complete stories instead of 6 incomplete. I also wish I had the answers to the questions that the book left me with. VERY FRUSTRATING."
4,A worthy addition to Black Hawk Down.,"This is a nice addition to the Black Hawk Down book and movie. Basically it is the story of six soldiers who were part of the battle in 1993. Yes, this book is not Black Hawk Down, but it does provide additional insight into this battle. I thought the six authors did well in providing their own picture of the battle. All six had different perspectives on what happened and this is shown through their stories.If you have one book to read about this battle, it would be Black Hawk Down. However, this is a nice addition for those interested in knowing further info on this infamous battle."
1,Worst futon ever made,"This futon is terrible. The frame squeaks like crazy, and you can feel the metal bars right through the incredibly thin mattress. Just awful. Don't buy this POS."
1,I will admit this was a hasty buy....,"I didnt do my research on this one, BUT When you are selling just a frame, DO NOT PUT SOFA IN THE TITLE AND HAVE A PICTURE OF A SOFA!!!0/5"
1,"Horribly uncomfortable, noisy, dangerous","I slept on of these for 8 solid months when I lived at my friend's house. It was the most uncomfortable godawful thing ever. It squeaks every time you move, and you could lose your hand converting the thing if you're not careful. Sitting or sleeping on a concrete floor is better."
1,TERRIBLE,"I've had this ""futon"" for 2 months now, and it has completely locked up when trying to close it. You can cut off your finger trying to make it fold out/in properly. It's definitely ""factory made in America"" or ""made in China"" as this thing isn't worth the material cost.STAY AWAY."
1,Deceiving buy.,"I had bought this futon on the 27th then read the reviews for it on the 28th and i found out that this was only a frame. Although it says frame in the title i think the company needs to do a better job of mentioning it ONLY being a frame and not the whole set. The pictures are deceiving. Now, a day later i called to cancel my order and it is too late and i have to pay $100 to send it back. I am no longer buying from this company. And i've learned my lesson to read reviews before confirming the order."
4,Enjoyable,"A quick witted yet refreshing way of telling her life story..I was not completely impressed with the way the writing ended the story..it felt somewhat rushed, my life in black and white gave me an insight on angela nissel..""she's a gem"""
5,"Don't Worry, Be Happy",I loved this book. It was absolutely hilarious! I was cracking up out loud ... on the subway that was particularly embarrassing. Ms. Nissel definitely has a gift. She is able to find the humor in even the most serious of subject matters.
1,what a disappointment,"What an awful book and what a letdown after hearing her interview on NPR where Angela Nissel apppeared like a humorous, open and light hearted person, none of which turned out to be true. After liking the first few chapters, it became very clear to me how race obsessed the author really is. There is a loooot more to life than the color of your skin and I found it extremely depressing that she is very biased against white folks. It is clear that she her disappointment about her white father having left her family has turned into irrational and often absurd prejudices against all white people. Her entire outlook on life is through the race lens; the author's generally high level of self absorbtion yields a potent mix that is not far from bigotry and racism.Keep in mind that I really wanted to like this book, too bad; I hope for Angela to find a white true friend that will open her eyes to the real world."
1,Warren Smith's heroics are matched only by his imagination,Warren Smith has written a brilliantly detailed and suspenceful male fantasy that would leave even Ian Flemming in stiches. This book is ridiculous! Shame on Presidion Press for printing it and Amazon from selling it. ...
1,Bad Beyond Description,"Warner Smith obviously never came within spitting distance of the enemy in Vietnam. It's a shame that Presidio Press, an otherwise respected publisher, let this piece of junk go out the door with their imprint."
3,mas o menos,es te albun esta mas o menos no me a rrepiento de aberlo comprado nieves de enero es el mejor
3,Fun for Kids,"I simply bought this because I wanted the Martian Hop Dance song. The instructor at Gymboree plays this CD every once in a while, and when I heard that song it brought back fond memories."
5,Wonderful sing-along CD,"I got this for my daughter when she was 10 months old. After listening to it every day for nearly three months, she and I both still love it. The songs are a lot of fun and easy to sing along with. Joanie Bartels has a very pleasant voice, as well. Nothing annoying or weird on this CD to drive parents crazy. Of the multitude of children's CDs we own, this is by far my favorite."
5,Fun for Toddlers,My wife's favorite Dance CD for our 17 month old son. We listen to it at the gym class he goes to and he really gets into the rythms. Fun CD for kids.
5,Fun Dance Music for Kids and Parents,"We love the songs on this CD! As a parent, I got tired of hearing little kids' songs. This is perfect because it appeals to my toddler and me. The songs and fun and upbeat."
4,FILTER- HEPA,"GREAT FILTER FOR THE HOLMES AIR CLEANER. THOUGH A BIT EXPENSIVE,IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ONCE EVERY 6-9 MONTHS."
4,At Long Last!,"The colorful story of the rapid rise and tragic early death of fabled singer-bandleader-composer Russ Columbo makes for fascinating reading. Lou Miano has done a first-rate job of researching the crooner's career, in the process shedding light on the early days of network radio, as well as records and film. Conspiracy buffs may be disappointed in the debunking of rumors surrounding Columbo's bizarre accidental death, but those interested in showbiz history will be pleased with this well-illustrated book. Columbo fans will be ecstatic that, at long last, a thorough examination of his life and work is available."
4,Well Researched and Ties Up the Loose Ends,"This well researched biography of singer Russ Columbo, who, had he lived, could have rivaled Crosby and Sinatra, provides a thorough look at Columbo's life, career, and death. The book provides a good history of how early radio and record deals were made. The author does what many biographies fail to do and that is tie up the loose ends. He lets us know what happened to Columbo's family members, girlfriends, business partners, and all of those who had an impact on Columbo's life. There are complete appendixes detailing Russ's radio and film appearances as well as record releases."
5,Everyone loves this watch!,I've received so many compliments on this watch! I love it too! People can't believe it's by Nike. It's sporty but looks elegant and hip. It was a little difficult to figure out how to set the time and date... the directions are iconic and a few words would have helped.
2,Not a text for beginners,"I was assigned this text for a junior/senior level industrial engineering course, and I didn't find it particularly helpful. The constant citations in the text were tremendously annoying, and the lack of organizational information at the beginning of chapters (i.e. no numbered list of topics, etc.) made it hard to use as a reference.Probably more appropriate to those who already have previous experience or training in this area."
4,Very complex,"This book is more useful to industrial engineers than business students. We had to use this as our business text for an inventory management class. There are some Ph.d students in industrial engineering who struggle with this, not to mention the rest of the class.However I do like the direct nature book. Everything is presented without a lot of fluff. The concepts are presented very thoroughly, and this is a well-respected text. However, it is not for the lay-person. The mathematics could be a bit less formal as well, but are probably necessary for the subject matter."
2,Very Technical,Book goes into great detail with plenty of math for examining inventory levels. This makes this book very hard reading. Does not spend a lot of time on JIT.
5,The King!,"If you play multiple Combat Flight Simulators you will not find a better Throttle. I've tried most and none of them compare to CH Products. Superior build quality and functionality. They will last you a lifetime of flying and fighting in the virtual skies. Works perfectly with Oleg Maddox's IL2 Sturmovik series, LOMAC, DCS: BlackShark, DCS: A-10C, Falcon 4.0, ect.Pair this with the CH Fighterstick and Pro Pedals for the ideal setup."
5,Classic Etruscan Art:,"Spivey's Etruscan Art has been out for a while, but it is still a classic. Well written in non-technical language with excellent photographs. This is an good survey of the Etruscan art pieces that have survived from 1000 BCE to 200 BCE. Definitely a best buy."
3,The ZEN Experience,"Wanting to learn more about Zen philosophy, I bought this book based on other reviews. I found the book to be somewhat more detailed than I expected. And ultimately I became somewhat feeling like Zen followers may not be that different than other religious followers, i.e. ""my version of Zen is right, yours is wrong"". I think I was hoping to find information that would lead me to a better place in the world. The book may be useful for its historical coverage of Zen followers but not as a tool to reach the Zen belief systems as the history can be off-putting at times."
4,Gives one an Historical Context,An excellent overview of the development of Zen and its place in the panorama of Buddhism. Best for those with at least some background in Buddhism. How can you beat the price?
1,Not interesting,I was expecting more from this book. I only got about 10 pages in. I got bored very soon and stopped reading it. Glad it was free. (downloaded on my kindle fire.)
2,"Heavy on Calories, Light on Content","I obtained this book after being smitten with the Nigella Bites TV show, and am disappointing with book compared to on the on-air version. True, the book contains the recipes I've seen on TV. In fact, it reads like a printed version of the TV script, and nothing else. Rather than being filled with more in-depth information and additional recipes that didn't make in into the short time of an episode (as I would have hoped), the limited content of the book is padded in metallic-inked graphics, more like a ""coffee table book"" than a cookbook. Most of the recipes are special-occasion, junk-food-type items; this is not a good basic cookbook. Nigella's earlier cookbooks do appear from a quick look to be more substantial; perhaps one of them would have been a better choice."
2,"Love her show, didn't think much of the book","I absolutely love her show on the Style network. I've watched her prepare so many recipes that i would love to try. I don't normally purchase cookbooks but loved her show so much that I made an exception. Bad exception. The book is nice but does not have very many recipes. For the price of the book, I would have expected much more. For this i gave it two stars. I've learned to go directly to the Style website for the recipes instead. The only caveat is that you must do so the same week she prepares the recipe on her show as the website does not catalog all of her recipes."
2,A great easy cook book,"Nigella Lawson is a good wholesome sort of cook, not interested in the glitzy, ritzy, fashionable, ego tripping and frankly bonkers style of cooking that is found in abundance in cook books these days, you know the sort of thing ""sea bream in tangerine and peanut sauce on a bed of wilted dandelion leaves"".She seems by and large to be interested in nourishing and old school food, here she presents a collection of punchy and unfussy recipes in her usual twinkling and engaging format.She is often accussed of being an ok cook and a great celebrity but I think this is nonsense, she is far to intelligent and interested by her craft to ever be intoxicicated by the cult of celebrity.She writes wonderfully well, so much so that a large dilemma is often deciding whether to cook her food or just read about it novel style! The photography is splendid too, the food and Ms Lawson looking equally stunning and deleicious.."
3,Good book but not as wonderful as the show,"I decided to buy this book after watching the show (also called nigella bites) which showed delicious recipes. I think not all of the recipes from the show are here because i have watched several episodes and they're not here. Anyways some recipes are quite good and delicious, the pictures from the book are ok( not as wonderful as bill granger's or jamie oliver's) if you plan on buying this book i recommend you to better watch the show and have a notepad and pen with you so you can write down the recipes."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book based on Nigella's two excellent previous books, both of which I own and have used. Nigella Bites appears to be an attempt to quickly exploit the buzz of her show. Do the math: the book is half the thickness of How to Eat, with larger typeface, frequent half and full page pics, whole pages devoted to a single quote, and 2-4 lined empty pages per chapter for your notes. I would guess that there is about 15% of the content of each of her previous works, and I am being generous. Avoid this tie-in and buy one of her other books."
1,not worth it.,deflates. uncomfortable. weird. are the words that come to mind. totally regret purchasing this. just taking up room in my closet now. abs are made in the kitchen and at the gym not with odd balls such as this.
4,Works great; Maybe Too Simple.,"Plugged it in and it worked right away on an OS X Mac running X Plane. No other software needed.Good, solid feel; doesn't ""walk"" around on the desk.No complaints, other than I wish I had gotten a model with more buttons."
5,"best joystick, period.","CH FlightSticks have always been the best game sticks, and now that Vista is dropping joystick port support, this USB version is king. Wide range of motion, precise, no drivers, impecable quality,... It's worth the price."
3,not a bad stick,"First of all, beware, this model does not have a twist axis for rudder. I'm not sure how I overlooked that. However I have since added rudder pedals. Frankly I like the feel of the Saitek ST290 better especially with it's hand rest. This stick feels a bit blocky and cheesy compared to that one. However I cannot find any fault with it's operation and it does seem sturdy. It could use more stick buttons for functions."
3,FAIR LITTLE COMEDY.,"Radio stars of yore, Edgar Bergen and Fibber McGee and Molly (Jim and Marian Jordan) are teamed in this cute and corny little 1941 flick which will be of interest to those who relish nostalgia. Bergen has his airplane factory built in Wistful Vista (Fibber McGee and Molly's fictional radio hometown). Halton is Bergen's rival and hammy Neil Hamilton (remember Chief Inspector Gordon on BATMAN?) plays Bergen's millionaire friend who buys Bergen's property to build an airport. Harold Peary - aka - THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE, is hammy but amusing as McGee's pal who unwittingly aids Halton's schemes to ruin Bergen. As Julie Patterson, 30 year-old Lucille Ball is vivacious and quite pretty as Bergen's secretary who almost marries Bergen's business manager, but predictably ends up the arms of Candace Bergen's Pop. Look for Sterling Holloway and frequent I LOVE LUCY guest player Charles Lane in bits."
3,"A good, but not great novel with a few holes. . .","In this novel, Mr. Bean has provided the reader with a ""serial killer"" set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin not long after the real serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Also surprisingly relavant to the times are the indications of child abuse by church officials.It is evident that Mr. Bean did, at one point live in Milwaukee as his descriptions of neighborhoods, etc. are quite true-to-life. It is also evident that not all of his research was quite as good as it could be. While towns, neighborhoods, and landmarks were quickly recognizable, his understanding of the hierarchy of the Church in Milwaukee was quite lacking.I found the book itself to be dark and disturbing, albeit with believable secondary character development and a sympathetic main character. I found the revelation of the actual murderer to be a bit unbelievable.Four stars for a reasonable mystery; minus one for using children as victims. Don't we have enough of that in ""real life""?"
4,Four Stars for All of Me!,"For all appearance sake, Serpentine Williamson's life looked picture perfect. She had the great job, some encounters with romance and a loving family. But turn the page and unfolds a story of a Nubian sister torment since childhood with her weight. Serpentines' story is the all-too-familiar one that today's woman face, trying to be the perfect size to fit what the media has deemed as the ""beautiful"" woman.In her quest to relive her life of her pain, she decides that taking her own is much less painful then trying to endure another pointless, senseless diet. This opens the door to another road that Serpentine must endure...facing up to the things, people and events that pushed her to the edge.Pages members immensely enjoyed this book, the characters and the storyline. Berry did an excellent job of providing the reader with a good visualization of the relationship between the characters."
4,Wonderful story told with humor and insight,"Serpentine Williamson needs to lose weight. At least that's what everyone is telling her. She is a TV journalist and is well qualified for an anchor spot but... her boss wants someone thinner.Her boyfriend, Carlin, says he loves her but...he is obsessed with with his ex who is a size 6.Her family is supportive of her but...they are always making comments about her weight.Finally she cracks under the strain of trying to be what other people think she should be and on New Year's Eve, she attempts sucide.It's a long road back before she learns who she really is and what is important. And finally in a truly beautiful moment, she has an encounter with Carlin which is totally satisfying.A highly readable book written with humor, sadness and honesty."
4,All of Me-A Voluptuous Tale,"You don't have to be heavy to enjoy or identify with this book. Nor do you need to be African-American. This book is for women. It's about meeting obstacles at every turn. It's about overcoming those obstacles. We can learn from our main character, Serpentine. She has come to some realizations in her life, as we all do sooner or later, and has to find a way to deal with these realizations. She also needs to figure out which of those realizations are accurate. You follow her through these and they are learning experiences.The highlights in the book, I believe, are the small introductions to each chapter. Some of these are pure poetry. Some carried more punch than the story line. They are thought provoking. They make you think about life.All of Me is worth the time."
4,"A Co-Cultural Interpretation of ""All of Me""","At first glance, ""All of Me"" appears to be a story concerning the life of a Black female television journalist with no intercultural dimensions. This could NOT be further from the truth. The story begins by illustrating the differences in culture and communiction via the main character Serpentine Williamson's conversations with her white male therapist Dr. Greeley. The beginning prologue, entitled 'Crazy People' sets the tone of the book. Serpentine states, ""I tried to explain to Dr. Greeley about Carlin,Mama,LaJune, the job and the weight....Unfortunately, he was more interested in doping me up than in hearing what I had to say."" Berry writes honestly and from the heart. ALL WOMEN who are concerned with the issue of weight and self worth would be doing themselves a disservice to skip this gem."
3,"Woo, Woo, Woo","I agree with another reviewer, needs some meat on its bones. There was nothing to sink your teeth into. I managed to get thru it, enjoying it at times, but wishing there had been more substance. Peace and love, Breezee"
5,A wonderful story,This book is my life. I could relate to most aspects of the book. The book starts out well and grabbed me till the end. The main character becomes your friend and you want to help her feel more confident. I highly recommend this book.
5,We need more book like these!,"She's done it again. Thank you Venise Berry for writing a book that not only addresses societal depiction of beautiful, but more importantly, the subconscious of women who sometimes choose to ignore their subscription to such ideologies. Serpentine was real. Very convincing. Nothing short of what I expected from the author. Like ""So Good,"" ""All of Me"" is definitely a keeper."
2,Only If You're Desperate To Read ....,"Let me first state, that Ms. Berry is a talented writer. I enjoyed SO GOOD very much.My bookclub read this book in May. We all wondered what happened with this one? I was excited about ALL OF ME, 'cause there aren't enough books out there exploring the ups and downs full-figure people go through. I felt that Ms. Berry had the potential to go somewhere with this story; but, she dropped the ball.I really cared nothing about the main character. Like a reviewer wrote, she glossed over on a main event in the story. In areas that she should have came out strong, she didn't. There were certain bits and pieces of the story that was good; but, overall the story suffered.Ms. Berry, you're one and one in my book. The next book will be a paperback..."
2,Diasppointing,"Although I found some interesting messages in this book, overall I thought it was somewhat disappointing. Some of the situations were not fully developed and I was very disappointed that a major event which occurs very early in the book was treated in an extremely cavalier manner. I was also extremely disappointed with the authors portrayal of Serpintine's last interaction with Carlin. The nature of her interaction with him and her response undercut everything Serpentine was supposed to have learned through her process of self discovery and self love. It demonstrated that she really had not learned much about self love and respect. Wait for the book in paperback."
2,Very Boring,"Although the overall message in All of Me was uplifting, the story was boring. I plowed through the novel with trepidation, hoping that by the next page something, someone, or some word would spark my interest, but I got to the end of the book, and nothing interesting ever occurred. I was very disappointed with the lack of intensity, and story telling that prevailed in this novel. Ms. Berry's first novel, So Good, was an impressive, interesting, and flowing novel. All of Me simply lacked spunk."
3,Cute,"Has its funny points and is dead-on in some points when she talks about the stigma of being overweight. But overall it went nowhere and was extremely light reading. The social commentary was nothing that everyone hasn't heard thousands of times. It's an OK read overall, but is not one that sticks with you or makes you think."
2,NEEDS SOME MEAT ON ITS BONES,"After reading So Good a few years ago, I was anxiously waiting to read Ms. Berry's new one. I must say that I was very disappointed in this effort. The plot was not smooth by any means; it skipped from one theme to another and seemed to be a hodgepodge of every magazine article relating to weight issues and biases against overweight people. Very cliche and predictable. The icing on the cake was the incident at the class reunion; so silly and ""thought about at the last minute"". Ms. Berry, next time fatten up your plot and give us something to chew on."
2,Disappointed,"While reading the blurb I thought I might find a deeper story between the covers. I am rarely one to leave a book unfinished; this one came close. I found it hard to feel any sustained sympathy for the main character. She consistently blames everyone for her problems (her mom, her men, the media), but rarely does the author reveal her consistently doing anything but looking for a quick cure to her obesity. The author's point about media influencing ideas of beauty (particularly weight)is well taken, but she takes no time in discussing the issue in terms of health and self esteem. How did Serpentine get to be a size 24? There are certainly deeper problems, and I felt cheated. I did not like the trite references to ""Serpentine Fire"", as if having your name as a title in a song is what validates you as a person."
3,ok,"This is the story of Serpentine, who is not happy with her weight or life, so she tries to commit sucide, but is not successful. She starts visiting with a doctor to talk to about her problems. This is novel of a woman finding out how to be happy for who she is."
5,"The ""Mature"" Hollies","I love all Hollies songs, at least all the ones I have heard and this one will now rate as among my favorites. Their songs have matured a bit from earlier releases and I personally think that ""Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress"" is the greatest rock song, ever, period, end of discussion.Someone is always comparing the Hollies to the Beatles which is OK. I mean, if you are going to be compared with someone, might as well be the best but I personally think they more closely resemble the Everly Brothers only the Hollies are better.If you want a great Hollies 1 CD collection of 20 songs, buy ""The Hollies, 20 Golden Greats"". It took a few weeks for Amazon to get it for me, but it was worth the wait. A much better deal that some of the other ""Greatest Hits"" from the Hollies I have seen displayed here and also at local stores.I am rambling far too much but I recently saw that the Hollies were still performing and just had the honor of having the number 1 cd in New Zealand!"
1,What a ripoff,I ordered these batteries thinking they were something special because of the 2100 mAh rating. After receiving them I was shopping for groceries and noticed that Energizer Rechargeable batteries are rated at 2500 mAh and are much cheaper. Don't buy these batteries when you can get more powerful ones at a cheaper price.
1,Nah,You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site. I did. They work great. Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries. Ridiculous.
5,Konica OPC Drum magicolor 2200,"The seller was prompt with the ship of the product. It was in the original box, the price and ship price were within comparible price ranges but enough better to encourage me to try their company and I am very pleased with the service overall."
5,Great Intake!!!,"I installed it on my 2002 toyota celica. Very easy install, took me about an hour. The instructions are very thorough and easy to understand. Performance wise it definitely makes a difference not to mention it sounds awesome...gives the car a deeper sound when given throttle."
4,Looks promising,Just got it in the mail today and it looks AWESOME. Shipping was fine and instructions are detailed with step by step pictures. A caveman could do this! Hopefully my boyfriend can I'm not putting it in lol. Overall solid looking product can post pictures and answer any questions after installation.
4,Great product and great results.,"I have been wearing these type of Truform socks for about 6 weeks now and I am amazed at how much better my legs feel. I have found that my legs are less fatigued and that the product is extremely comfortable. I would never go back to a standard pair of socks. Great product, great price and for me great benefit physically.Truform 15-25 Mens Dress Overcalf, Medium, Black (Pack of 2)"
5,BEST,"The Canon XL2 has been showing up in alot of complaining reviews, complaints realted to it's less than perfect imagery. From what Ive seen, the fact that the DVX100B is hard as heck to find says alot about which one is better. I find it very odd that a great number of these cameras are being sold by numerous retailers in Brooklyn who go by names like express, photosweep, Camera City....seems like one dealer is using multiple names and varied prices. If you need a DVX100B, its best to buy from an established dealer. BUT no one can beat the 24p quality of this camerta. Better deal than the new HD cameras which don't even have the 24p adjustment!"
5,From a real newbie....,I am a complete newbie to video and I love this camera. I had a tough choice to make when it came to spending this kind of $$ for a camera purchase. This one was reviewed very well on all the websites I checked (and I checked quite alot). The positives were echoed so often that I went with it over the others. I am quite pleased even though my learning curve still goes on. The picture qualitiy is excellent and I am learning to shoot better. The downside is I still have not received the DVD that came along with my purchase. The said it would take up to 8 weeks and I guess they intend on making it 8. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and can only say good things about the camera and the support and information about the camera and how to use it available on the net.
3,"Ok, but I'd recommend another","I bought this for my 8 yr old son and did not immediately notice that there is not a clip to hold a score card, so he has to either put it in his pocket or bag. I would recommend a bit larger cart, even for a kid, so that it will have a place for their score card. Other than that, the cart has held up well."
