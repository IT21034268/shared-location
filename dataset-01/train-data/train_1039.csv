5,Quite brilliant,"This is my favourite 70's Jazz album.A marvellous quartet of musicians, featuring Keith Jarrett on Piano and Jan Garbarek on Sax. A wide range of styles from the Gospel influenced ""Long as Your..."" to frankly undefineable (but brilliant) pieces like ""The Windup"". Spiral Dance is another stand-out track. The key thing about this album, is that it is an entirely accoustic album, made in an era when the trend in Jazz was for more electric fusion based bands.The musicianship is of the highest order, and the compositions are mostly written by Jarrett.Have a listen to the samples on Amazon - unless you're a die-hard dixieland/trad fan there will be something here for you."
3,Mystical? I don't see it.,"I was surprised to see reviews calling this book mystical. Joyner is so clearly anti-mystical and pro-christianity. I assume the people who think that he is mystical are familiar with the kabballah/kemetic concepts of the Tree Of Life and think (completely in error) that Joyner is trying to merge those belief systems with Christianity. I wonder whether these critics have actually read this book.I don't agree with many of Joyner's ideas, but still on the whole I value this book. His love of, and devotion to, Christ comes thru loud and clear.One point of contention I have is his claim that Jesus is the Tree Of Life. That does not make sense to me. If Jesus is the Tree Of Life, wouldn't God have driven man toward the Tree Of Life, rather than put up a flaming sword to keep man _away_ from the Tree Of Life?"
5,sanding houselogs,These discs work well sanding houselogs which have darkened with time. They leave some swril marks upon close observation but a quick go over with 100 grit would leave them quite smooth and looking good.
3,good grit but the hook&loop's sh*#,"These discs line-up well on my sander and have a pretty good grit. They do a good job for as long as they work- UNFORTUNATELY more often than not the hook and loop backing gives out long before the grit of the paper. I have had this problem with several discs now, sanding away wonderfully and suddenly the disc goes spinning off the sander and will never reattach and grip the same again. I am pretty disappointed because the paper itself seems to do a pretty good job, but I can't stand all the 'wasted' discs. I have never had this problem with the Norton discs, so I don't think it is just me or my sanders. For lighter use they might be great, but then why do you need a 50 pack?!"
1,Plan to throw it out fast,"This paper did not last long compared to the gator brand at Lowe's. Plan to trow it out fast, it does not last long and seems thin, and I think it wears out my sanding pad faster, I had to return it and after paying for shipping back, I'm still glad I got rid of it."
5,"Move Out Of My Way, I'm Spinning Around","History made again by Ms. Minogue! This single debuted at #1 in Oz & the U.K. simultaneously; she last accomplished simultaneous #1's 12 years ago with ""I Should Be So Lucky."" That should give you some indication how good this song is! Spinning Around is pop perfection, one listen is never enough. People here in the US that profess not to like Kylie have heard this, are singing it afterward & then asking where they can get it. Kylie sings this in a wonderful range, the tempo is foot tapping and the chorus instantly memorable. 2000's summer theme is here! CD1 has some good remixes and the video, CD2 has 2 great b-sides co-written by Kylie. One is the 60's esque ""Cover Me With Kisses"" ( vaguely reminiscent of the Madonna ""Beautiful Stranger"" style ) and the lovely midtempo ballad ""Paper Dolls."" A glimpse of wonderful things to come on the new album ""Light Years"" due out this September..."
5,Top Rate Fun,"It's rather strange that Ms Minouge has not enjoyed the fame that she so rightly deserves. She is really big in the tiny island of Singapore where I reside and of cos her home nation Australia where I have lived for a few years. ""Spinning Around"" must be one danceable pop/disco track that will become an instant classic and a hot club favourite. Dance tunes have gotten more and more electronic of late and this is a refreshing change- somewhat back-to-the-basic sort of song. My, the infectious hook is still spinning aroung in my head as I type this. Get both singles and get them now!"
5,Kylie is back and better than ever!,"For the last few years the music of Kylie Minogue has not been given the artistic praise and airtime that this Australian Diva deserves. Her last album, Impossible Princess had many great songs but received little airtime so it is great to hear that this great new single has shot straight to No. 1 on the UK Charts. This just shows that Kylie has survived the 80s, 90s and now is continuing to reinvent herself in the 00s. Go Kylie, we love you."
3,But will she ever hit #1 in the US???,"Spinning Around is a GOOD song, though it runs thin, after many repeated listen. The remixes on this CD single do not do justice to the song too.The only way, I reckon Ms Minogue could relive her American glory in the eighties, is to do a REMAKE of her SAW hit ""Locomotion"", remixed to a Y2K groove. Call it ""LOCOMOTION 2000"", if you want.Then, maybe, just maybe, she might be lucky enough to secure an American Billboard #1.But then again, the Americans aren't the ones with the best taste in music."
5,accessible help with depression,"As a clinical social worker, I frequently recommend this book to clients, colleagues and friends for help with their depressed family members. The section on anti-depressant medication is especially clear and easy to understand. Dr. Golant's recommended strategies are enhanced by his use of vignettes from his practice and personal life to make a very touching and accessible book."
3,Not nearly as helpful as previous reviewers suggest,"The author freely shares from his own past, though clear and active advice on how to advance a positive progression is absent. He tells us very short stories of patients who had the symptoms/situations he describes, but they all fall flat when one asks himself how to practically apply the story to himself.The most helpful book I found was ""You Can Beat Depression: A Guide to Prevention & Recovery"" by John Preston. Very well written, for both the sufferer and their potential assistants."
5,Exceptional Value,This is exceptional value - a 4 CD collection with a 56 page illustrated booklet. The re-mastered recordings are comparable to any in my extensive collection of Bix's work. If I were to criticise it would be the cardboard covers to the CDs but at this price I am not going to knock a star off.
3,Too Much and Not Enough,"If it is important to you to have every recording Bix ever made, this is a good investment.The problem is that on so many of Bix's recordings, he is surrounded by mediocre musicians. (For example: the Wolverines, Bix's first group, which is very well represented in this collection, are just awful.) And on a lot of the other recordings -- for example, the records he made toward the end of his life with Paul Whiteman -- Bix's performances are fresh and vibrant, but the rest of it is uninteresting or worse.If it is not important to you to have every recording Bix ever made, put your money down on ""Bix and His Gang"" (which I have also reviewed). Right now this one appears to be out only on vinyl. But if you can overcome that, you will be richly rewarded.The Bix Beiderbecke Story Vol. 1 (Bix and His Gang) - Vinyl LP Record"
4,Over the Top Feherty,"In my opinion, David Feherty is one of the best golf announcers working the circuit. I also like the columns that he writes for Golf Magazine, so I would have been surprised if I disliked his first fiction novel.I was surprised at how much I liked this book. The characters, although outrageous and over the top, are very sympathetic and you want to see them succeed, even though you know that both they and a place like Scrought's Wood could never exist in the real world."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. It was poorly written and jumped around too much. The book also had too many odd characters and the book did not flow well. Also I did not find this book at all funny or interesting. I believe the author should stick to golf commentaries and short stories.
5,GOLF IN THE KINGDOM on acid and nitrous oxide.,"I'm the author of THE GREEN and THE FOURSOME, written under the pseudonym ""Troon McAllister."" It's not often that I get jealous of someone else's writing, but David Feherty has a touch and a voice that is to die for. Never mind the ""professional"" reviewer who completely misperceives the point of this book (they would call LORD OF THE RINGS ""implausible""), silliness is the whole bloody point. NASTY ROUGH is pure whimsy of the best sort, with some parts so hysterically funny it would be just as well you didn't read it with other people in the vicinity.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,"Pretty funny, though a little over the top","David Feherty's comic novel about the loveable inhabitants of the Scrought's Wood Golf Club, and their raunchy adventures on and off the links is a pretty funny story, with a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled in amongst piles of bathroom humor.The writing is okay, though it leaves something to be desired, and even the most die-hard Feherty fan will grow weary of the barrage of bathroom jokes. Do we really need to know that a caddy pooped his pants in an airplane once (although the subsequent episode involving that caddy and a red sweatshirt is one of the funnier moments in the book)?I laughed quite a bit at this book, and even if it was a little heavy-handed with the toilet humor, it has some absolutely hilarious moments. If you like golf and David Feherty's sense of humor, then you'll enjoy this book."
1,terrible,"These are the worst glasses I've ever had. They are way too weak. One arrived chipped. Three broke the first time I washed them. Since then, (two weeks ago) two more have broken during use and I am afraid to wash them. Dont but these glasses. They just are too weak to use."
2,American Bulldog prologue with 10 chapters of generic filler,"The best things about this book are the pictures and the fact that it exists at all; was the ONLY book I could find on ABs. Although author seems knowledgable enough on subject, I got the impression this book was created in a hurry ( less than 1 day) to cash in on a demand for AB books. Basically there are about 30 pages specific to American Bulldogs and the rest(140 pages) could be about poodles, pugs or rotweilers. Also, considering all the name brand product illustrations and plugs throughout the book, it could have been offered for free as paid advertising. However, since I own an American Bulldog,or he owns me, the pictures in the book make it a keeper. I would have given it more stars for more dogs pictures and less product endorsements. Black-eyed Susan or Dick the Cruiser would have been a better choice for the cover."

2,"While the pictures are decent, the representation limited","While the pictures are decent and this the first breed specific American Bulldog text, the breed representation is limited as well as the authors analysis of different lines besides his own. Over all I was dissappointed."
4,Connecting head and heart with experience,"This book presents valuable guidance for every parent and grandparent, presented in an easy-to-read array of lessons and stories, quotes, good ideas, anecdotes, and photos. I found good ideas about how to reach out to my granddaughter 2,000 miles away, and how to talk with my daughter about my needs and concerns as a grandparent. Don shows us many reasons and ways to bring the generations together."
3,Cracked Me Up!,"While not quite at the level of ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People,"" I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times while reading this one. However, I must say I was almost disappointed to see Toby becoming somewhat more of a nice guy towards the end!"
2,My Hands Definitely Didn't Clap.,"Boring, not as good as the first one. Would make you think the first one was a bore too. Sorry Toby."
2,"Doesn't work on Windows 7, 64-bit","Be careful because this program doesn't work on Windows 7, 64-bit. The Product Features though claims it works with Windows 7, 32-bit.""* Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP, Vista, Win 7 (32-bit)"".but the System Requirements section doesn't mention Windows 7 at all:"" * Platform: Windows XP Professional / XP Home Edition / 2000""I'll try to update my review when I try to install it on the old XP desktop PC that I have."
4,Good & Fun,My daughter really likes this game. It challenges her math skills. The levels increase quickly which can be a little frustrating for her. Over all we like it.
3,Good book but a little light on info.,"After taking the MSF course I bought this book and others as a follow-up. My main disappointment with the MSF Guide to Motorcycling Excellence is that it little farther than the booklet that came with the course.The information contained in the book is obviously valuable and correct (given that MSF are the subject matter experts on motorcycle safety) but there is not a lot of depth to the material in the book. It is written in a push button manner lacking sufficient exmplanations of the ""why"" of the techniques it describes.If you are looking for a simple to read, basic guide to motorcycle safety this book is probably for you. If you know nothing about motorcycling then this is a good (if a bit expensive start).If you want to learn more, are detailed oriented, or need to really understand something before you can apply it, I would recommend looking for one of the other books on motorcycling that are available."
2,"Good, But Buy This Other Book Instead","Though this helped me to learn how to ride, I'm glad I bought ""Proficient Motorcycling"" by David L. Hough at the same time. (Thanks Amazon for recommending it!) It includes everything in this book and more. I found much of this book to waste too much time on theory that really didn't help you learn how to drive a motorcycle. The traction pie charts on the cover are an example--interesting, but how do apply it when I'm sitting on the bike! Just go with David Hough's book and save yourself a few bucks."
3,Take the course!,"This book is an incomplete presentation of the material the MSF covers in their basic riding course. If a potential reader is a complete motorcycling novice, this information is best obtained by taking the actual course and getting the practical on-bike instruction that comes with it. Once the basics are handled in the course, either of the books by David L. Hough would be more useful."
3,Sir Charles but where is the rest?,This DVD is about 45 minutes long. It shows highlights from Charles early days as a high schooler through to his college years and later onto his NBA days with the 76s and the Suns. There are some great highlights and interviews with Charles and other NBA greats. The majority of the DVD is taken up with the Suns battles with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.The DVD falls short in length and content. It misses Charles' days with the Rockets and his quest for a championship.
3,Charles Barkley,"This DVD was very informative about Charles Barkley life even prior to the NBA. I guess I expected more clips of the NBA basketball games and especially when they won the championship. If you are interested in learning about his life, when he began his basketball career in from high school to NBA, this is a good DVD. If you are only interested in his NBA career and want to see some of the more exciting games, you need to get a different DVD."
5,Not as scary as you thought,"A good introduction to Islam.Nice book for children. This will help introduce them to one of the world's major religions, particularly to their place of worship.Read the book, visit your local mosque and befriend a muslim - its just that simple"
1,Doesn't work at all.,"Doesn't work at all. That's pretty much all I have to say. It's like candle-waxy in colour (white) and texture, and just makes the skin look shiny without budging the make up."
5,Awsome product,"Great quality, Speedy, wounderful worry free experience, Very warm, get many compliments on the jacket."
5,Best book of prayer ever.,"I have had a copy for 2 years. People read it and wanted copies hence I ordered two more copies to share,Prayers for the modern day and for everyone Stan Fortuna a remarkable man. God Bless."
5,Loved it.....addictive!,Loved it and immediately started watching the next season about Venezuela! Addictive! Sent it to my friends as a gift.
5,still not watchin nbc,"Earl was refreshing and still is, gotta love dvd's. I'm still not watching nbc. They don't miss me I'm sure, but I don't miss them either."
5,"My name is Earl, season2",This product was received within a timely manner and my husband likes this series so he is pleased with his gift.
5,Ended too soon,"I watched Earl from the pilot episode and found it to be hilarious. I really didn't see it coming when it was canceled after the season 4 cliffhanger. At least the general format has lived on through Raising Hope, which is also a 5 start show."
5,Movie,This is a great show. You seem to have every thing i am looking for. Thank you for having the show.
5,Great Show,My Name is Earl is one of those few shows that never gets to serious and you are able to watch any episode or season in any order.
5,My Name Is Earl - Excellent Product,Thank you so much for this product. It was in perfect condition and my husband had a wonderful birthday because it came lightening fast and was here in time for his birthday and it was super cheap!! Thanks again!!
4,A second dose of Earl,"I liked season 1 a lot. Season 2 was pretty good, though not as good as 1. If you liked season 1, I'd say pick up season 2."
1,Pinball,"This game works fine if you use Windows 98. If you are using Windows XP or 2000, the game does not run at all. Very unhappy with game. No installation instructions or game instruction. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Recommended,"This 4-disc set installs each game on your PC, but then requires the proper game disc to be inserted for each game to be played... useless on a MAME arcade setup like I have because one cannot easily access the computer's CD-ROM drive each time one wants to play.Software companies that $sell$ me their software and then treat me like a thief by restricting my use of the programs don't set well with me."
1,Not Real Pinball,"I read the reviews that raved about this product but they were wrong. Pinball is about flippers, bumpers, and tactically nudging the table to get more play from the ball. It's not about inceasent boggie music, disembodied voices making pithy comments, flashing scores and pictures at the top of the table that distracts play, and prezel-shaped channels that limit maneuvering. About one thing the reviewers were correct: four disks for sixteen dollars is a great deal. The catch is the product is so high tech it isn't pinball anymore. I uninstalled mine and gave it away. What a disappointment."
5,Deal of the century,"This package includes all 4 highly acclaimed Empire pinball simulations. The Web, Timeshock, Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey. I am not going to even bother writing about each individual game as many on amazon have already done so for each. The manuals in this package are on the cds. To get all 4 of these wonderful simulations for such a low price is truly a great deal."
2,Does a great for about six jobs,"I decided to buy the factory reconditioned Bosch 129DVSK-RT because of the brand's reputation and that I also own a Bosch jigsaw and mitre saw which both have served me well over the years. Because of their reputation I figured that a ""factory reconditioned"" unit should be just as good as a new one however after about six uses, it stopped working. After taking it apart (it was recondition and so had not warrente) I figured that the speed variable control AND/OR the on/off switch had burnt out and so I ordered both new from the factory. After waiting a month for the parts I finally received them and promptly installed them. AWESOME! The unit work.... for one last job and then quit AGAIN. I again took it apart to try and trouble shoot the issue but to no avail (I suppose the armature or field are toast). So had I bought a new one, I may not have needed to go without a orbital sander for now ever a month!"
4,A Near Blues Classic,"This is one of Louisiana Red's better albums. He actually has a huge number of albums that have been released over the years, both as LPs, CDs, or both. Unfortunately many of his albums are on very small labels and are either hard to find anywhere or are out of print.He is a contemporary blues guitarist / singer, but sounds more like an old time performer. Great blues voice and an excellent guitarist. I've seen him live as well, and he is very intense. All blues collections should have at least three or four of his many albums. At least one live one. This one is a near classic."
5,This should be a current hit record.,"I heard a cut from his record on a local blues show. I listened to some other tracks on the Internet and then bought the album. The guitar work is pure 60's Chicago blues done in a simple and compelling way. His singing was always good, even as an old man singing at blues festivals. It is bar far the best I have heard on this record. He has a couple of social songs that retain their power 50 years latter. If you love 50's and 60's blues that sound great 50 years later--and that completely hold their own with current bans and styles buy this record."
5,witty and suspenseful,"PUTT TO DEATH finds pro golfer Cassie Burdette on hiatus from the tour, working as a pro at a snooty Connecticut country club. When two outspoken club members turn up dead on Cassie's first week on the job, she has to work overtime to figure out who's zooming who, who can be trusted and who might be out to implicate her in the murders. Cassie's problems with her neglectful father, her almost-boyfriend, Mike, and her new shrink are just as suspenseful as the mystery. In fact, the personal and the mystery plots dovetail neatly to provide a clever and satisfying ending. As always, the writing in this series is witty and full of pithy observations of human, and golfer, behavioir."
3,Cassie's on the case again,The third in a series (my appologies I previously wrote that A Buried Lie was the third). The characters and development are becoming a little formulaic. The country club setting and characters weren't as interesting. Although I could see the motive for murder coming the villian wasn't revealed until the end. It took an extra chapter to explain the motive behind it all. Still love Cassie and can't wait for the next installment.
4,A birdie for Roberta!,Being a hack golfer I loved the premise under which Roberta has developed Cassie the main character under real world terms.
1,"Mirka 6"" 6-hole 80 grit sanding disk",I ordered an assortment of Mirka sanding disks (different grit) for my Porter Cable 6 inch random orbit sander.The 80 grit was suppose to be 6 inch / 6-hole but has no holes.I tried to access the web site to initiate a return or replacement.The web site would not recognize my order number.After several tries I gave up.
1,The Essential Men At Work,i was very upset! i wish i had not purchased this item. the dvd did not play in any of my dvd player and i was ask to returned item and they have no received it back and i am getting charged for it! they should specify the dvd will only play in some dvd players.
1,Thumpkin and the Easter Bunnies,This is some of the worst animation I have ever seen. The cover is very deceiving. The faces of the characters don't seem to keep up with the words they are saying. There is no music in the background and so there are large stretches of silence. I doubt this could keep a child interested for very long. Very slow and poorly done.
2,Outdated,"I found the information basic and it's good for that, because certain concepts just don't change. The design ideas though were pretty outdated. I read it once and put it in the book drive bin."
2,Spots on discs,"My prior batches of Ridata DVD+RW's from Amazon used to be pretty good. My most recent order has been pretty bad - of the 25 discs, about 5 of them are now unreadable and have visible spots underneath! Other users also seem to be reporting this (on DVD+R batches as well) - I don't know if this is isolated to Amazon's supply, but be aware.Update Sept6, 2005: Now MORE of the discs are starting to get spots! I'm not sure what is happening. I am going to contat Ritek to see what they can do about it. Until then, I'd recommend avoiding this batch of DVD+RW's."
3,"Good Price for 4x DVD+RW, but quality is mixed","I've burned about 9 DVD+RWs from my spindle. I've had two failed burns. The burns failed and the disc cannot be erased. I've tried multiple programs and with no success to erase these bad discs. My hardware is LG GSA-4081B with latest firmware (v1.04). The other 7 discs have had no problems. Using DVDinfoPro2 I found the disc media info to be listed as Ricoh.I would not buy these again, because they are unreliable. The quality of these DVD+RWs varies too much to use for important data archives."
4,"No Errors, odd shadow","bought here on Oct 22, RICOHJPNW11, 25 good 4x burns(2 had to be full-erased to get them to burn)5 of 5 good reburns, all first try no errors on LG4120Ball full verify ok, no slowdowns shown on Nero DVDSpeed.Slight irregular shadow all around clear hub area on all disks.These are ~hubless disks."
1,power calibration errors,I have been using Fuji DVD+/- 4x and was attracted to the price of Ridata discs. These discs don't work on my Sony DRX-510UL. All I got was power calibration errors message. I had to return them. I am sticking with Fuji.
3,"Good product, but the rebate sucks","I have no problem with the product so far. But the rebate is way too bad. I got the DVD on December 2004 and sent the rebate right away. It is now almost end of May 2005, but I have not received my rebate yet. Although I have emailed and called several times, but still."
3,ac nyc ny,"so far every disk work fine 10 of them, no problemprevious poor reviews scare me, luckly my pioneer 109did a good job"
4,Same media as Memorex 4x DVD+RW,"The media code is RICOHJPNW11, the same as Memorex branded disks. Visual inspection shows no obvious defects and I've burned several with Nero on an NEC 2500A at 4x with no verification errors. At this price, they are not much more than quality 4x DVD+R's. I've ordered two more spindles."
4,"Fun, but a little misleading","Great game, involving and detailed. I found myself up at the wee hours of the night playing this game. Even had quite an itch to kill annoying innocents.Fallout 2 is great.Fallout 1....I don't know. I haven't played it. I bought this game because of the price and the compatibility with Windows 2000 advertised. But make no mistake, Fallout 1 is NOT supported by Windows 2000. So I guess that's 5 bucks down the drain.Still, 10 bucks for even just Fallout 2 is a great deal."
5,Why Haven't you played this?,These are excellent turn based RPGs and I found it awsome to find out all the back story to fallout 3 and New Vegas. If you liked Fallout 3 and don't mind playing something turn based then definately play these.
1,great game if it worked,"fallout one is awesome, fallout two won't install and neither will fallout tactics which is included in this pack. Dont waste your money. The fallout series is awesome in its detail and is one of the best old-school rpg's that you can really get immersed in....I just wish the format was better quality."
5,Best CRPG ever.,"If you're only going to buy one CRPG in your life (OK, it's a dual-pack, but anyway), Fallout is the one to buy. This hard hitting game whipes the floor with all those other games filled with grumpy dwarves, pansy treehugging elves and other inane fantasy clichés. Using Black Isle's own rule system, SPECIAL, probably the best CRPG system ever, this game delivers the goods when it comes to roleplaying and mutant slaying.Buy it!"
3,"Not too bad, for an older game","The game is pretty easy to learn to do, as in the mechanics of the gameplay are straightforward.I love RPG genre, so this fits right in with the other classics like Morrowind and Kotor, and My new favorite, the Witcher EE. I have only just begun to play, So I may have more to say at a later date."
3,Not that great,"The game is fun to play but has gliches, such as characters that block your exit of a room. Great game that needs a little fine tuning."
2,Fallout Falls Down,"This game had a great opening, but came with no instructions (a serious downside) and a steep learning curve. Once I got going, it became painfully aparent that the game was tediously slow. Unless you want to spend the better part of your life playing an outdated game, pass on this one."
1,Fallout Blindness,This is by far the worst game I ever started to play. I felt my way through total darkness in vault 13 killing all the rats and hoping things would get better. I then felt my way through Shady Sands killing all the scorpions ( in total darkness) hoping things would get better. I then felt my way around in vault 15 ( in total darkness) trying to find the elevator and decided this game was not for me. Spending hours feeling my way around in the dark trying to find places and things while fighting rats and scorpions is not my idea of fun.
3,john michael talbot CD,"This is a great CD but the quality could have been a little better. I have to turn the volumn up louder on this Cd in order to hear it. Otherwise, I am glad I made the purchase."
1,Save your money this toy is poorly constructed,"I AM TOTALLY UPSET WITH THIS ITEM. THE POORLY DESIGNED STRUCTURE OF THE FIGURE IS THE REASON WHY. THE BODIES ARE DIECAST, HOWEVER, THE LIONS HAVE WEAK/CHEAP PLASTIC LEGS AND JOINTS THAT ARE BOUND TO BREAK. THE BLACK LIONS' PLASTIC LEGS ARE NOT SUITABLE TO CARRY THE HEAVY DIECAST BODIES OF THE BLUE AND YELLOW LION. IN FACT, MY BLUE LION KEPT FALLING OFF THE BLACK LIONS' REAR LEG. IN SHORT THIS IS A PEICE OF JUNK!!!"
3,Looks nice but poor quality,"I purchased this for my ex for his birthday. He loved voltron as a kid so I thought he would like to add this to his collection of Gundams. It seemed fun putting it together and it looks nice but like everyone else said, it's not at all durable. You have to be very careful with it, I could never imagine this being a kids toy or being taken apart several times. For the price, I expected better construction. If you plan to just put it together and display it though you should be ok, unless you have cats like me that like to knock everything down."
1,Not toy quality,"My son is four and a half and was introduced to the Voltron series via DVD. It was his very first toy craze and all we heard about for months was how he wanted Voltron toys. The description says the plastic is durable but it is not. We kept the shield, sword and wings in the box since they were so sharp. We showed our son how to form Voltron and break it down into the lions and he was able to do it after two demonstrations; much faster than the adults in our household. We showed him where the weak points were, ""oh, Lance's legs, got it"" he said. Two hours of playing with Voltron on Christmas morning were all he got. The Voltron fell from a height of 19 inches (a cat knocked it off a short chair while I was watching) and both the legs broke off. This is completely ridiculous for the amount of money spent. Let's hope Super Glue lives up to it's marketing better than this toy."
3,Not the Real Thing,I bought this as a gift for my brother who is a couple years my senior. He loves this kinda thing and was very happy with it. My problem is that when i bought it i thought that it was exactly like the original toys that we played with as children. it's not. it's simply a collectable.
5,Great product. Works exactly as advertised.,This item works great. Its exactly as advertised. It should work for almost any 4pin connector if you install it correctly over the wires and not the tip. See the images I posted to see how it looks and works. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to drill holes to mount a bracket.
3,Hopkins Mag-Flat 48095,"Item probably OK with other Hopkins products, but it will not work with other 4-wire connectors because the cover for the connector must be attached the connector itself and not by a loop around the 4 wires as is the case with Valley, Reese, Draw-tite and probably all others but Hopkins. The packaging for the 48095 ( but not the Amazon description ) says that it ""can be used with any Hoppy 4-wire flat"", but it probably should say that it can ""only"" be used with the Hoppy."
4,Math concepts (rounding this time) in simple book format,"My children (ages 6 and 4) and I enjoy most of the Stuart J. Murphy Math Start books that we have read. In each one there is a single math concept taught in the format of a read aloud book.In this book, several coyotes are discussing several other types of animals they see. One of them doesn't bother to count them. While the others are counting, this coyote tries to eat one of the animals. She is never successful. ""She slunk. She crept. She jumped! She missed."" But she always gets close when adding the numbers the other coyotes got, because she rounds. Adding by 10's is easy."
4,She loves to slide!,"The teachers in my 14 month old daughter's art class read this book once and I thought it was a good book. I brought it and my baby loves to slide the pages in and out. She already knew how to say star, moon, and heart, but now she can recognize more shapes. I brought one for her little playmate, and the mom loves it too.Of course, I then had to get other Chuck Murphy books, now we have his whole collection practically. The Razzle series is only ok, prefer this series."
3,Kinda Boring,"I bought this book along with Slide 'N' Seek Opposites for my one and a half year old nephew, but didn't find this one very impressive. It compares shapes to images that look nearly the same; such as a yellow star to a boring looking yellow starfish, and a pink heart to a pink heart shaped Valentine. Since my nephew doesn't know what starfish or Valentines are yet, it just seems like he'll be looking at the same boring image twice.On a very good note, the book itself seems very sturdy so if he does like it, it should hold up well against him."
4,An eye opener for a Generation X'er,"Being a Generation X'er, this is the first book that I have read on this topic. I'm not comfortable with all the anger expressed in the book as it just supports the images of raging feminists which detract from the matter at hand. I'm a little disappointed at how women seem to be painted as not having any freedom of choice. I've always considered myself as someone who owes to herself to make a choice and to live with that choice - not to blame it on a system. All this aside, I found this book an education on a topic which I new little about. Ms. Greer is very knowledgeable on numnerous topics and it all makes for fascinating reading. I know have some stong feelings on the topic of being a woman - and I am thankful for the book challenging my previuosly undeveloped thoughts and feelings."
5,The Ultimate Test,"I'm using Greer's book as a ""prerequisite"" course for men who want to date me. Their reaction tells me nearly everything I need to know about them, and it also gives us something to talk about on our first date. So far, 2 men have read the book & both have turned out to be dyed-in-the-wool misogynists. Greer's excellent book saves me time & energy, & spares me the emotional drainage incurred by dealing with the typical woman-hating male."
1,"First, Do No Harm","First, Do No Harm. This should be a code for all human beings...no just doctors.I am a member of the AISSG (Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group. It is absolutely criminal to be allowed to write damaging untruths and get them published. How many lives will you affect? What good are you doing in the world? Is there any more noble purpose to our lives than to affect people in a positive way?The ""facts"" on AIS presented in The Whole Woman are absolutely FALSE! And what is more troubling is that they are damaging and an insult to injury thrust upon a group of women who have suffered enough abuse at the hands of the ignorant.Poor Show."
2,Frothy and frivolous,"Miss Greer deserves a pat on the head for this book. She is one of the few feminists who admit that women, not men, commit most abuse on children as well as half of all assaults on siblings or spouses. An interesting gripe in her book is that only 23 per cent of men will consent to cook when they have a female in the house. Maybe this is because hardly any women will service a car when they have a male in the house. I like Greer1s writing style. It is crisp, frothy and frivolous."
1,Empty rhetoric based on sloppy research,"I write as a member of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) Support Group. Professor Greer has not understood or researched the biological or social facts about AIS; and instead of checking the medical literature has merely quoted, out of context, from newspaper and magazine articles then added her own interpretation. The socio-cultural premises that she puts forward concerning AIS women, and which she pretends to derive from biological principles, therefore have no foundation whatsoever. I bought the book, read what she had written on AIS, and took it back and got a refund. I have no inclination to see whether the rest of her book is any better argued."
5,the whole woman...,"Germaine Greer in this book allows herself, as always, the space to connect with women in all their diversity. She invites you explicitly to disagree if you wish and doesn't give a damn if you do...The book is wickedly funny...i love the little quotes that pop up out of nowhere...and chapter upon chapter about women, about women and men, work, relationships, health, housework - Actually, that's my favourite bit. I love the lines at the start of the 'housework'chapter:""By the millenium housework should have been abolished. In a sane world meaningful repetition of non-productive behaviour would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive behaviour.""p.129)What a voice!Everytime a book of hers comes out I expect to be challenged...I don't always agree with everything - now that would be scary! But I certainly respect the depth and vision within."
1,soliloquize bable!,"This book was 384 pages too long! What Ms Greer spouted on all those pages could've been summed up on as few as 3 pages! Reading it was like being in a college lecture hall, listening to a professor talk on the over commercialism and consumerism that is plaguing this world. Granted equal rights and fair treatment for women in this mad world of ours is not even close to the ideal. It needs a heck of a lot of work. Work that can be completed as we celebrate that which is womanhood. Just because you like to wear makeup, and keep a clean house and like sexual intercourse, and I stress the penetrative part!, does that make us unliberated females?!"
4,Great for the price,"You can't beat the price and they are great for tea, water and bar glasses are a good size for drinks. We like how they fit in your hand. The shipping price was 1300, but it was still 10.00 cheaper than buying them at Target."
5,Thumb and finger impressions,I L-O-V-E the thumb and finger impressions that make them easy to hold! Both sizes in the box are useful.
1,DON'T BUY THESE!!!,"The other reviewers are right! Don't buy these! I purchased a set of 16 and have one left. I have NEVER had glasses that break like these. The shape of the base seems to be the problem. They crack for no apparent reason, at the base. I had one sitting on the counter, 5 minutes after I took it out of the cooled dishwasher, and it cracked. Another cracked while sitting in the cabinet, 30 minutes after being put away. Several cracked when we poured chilled beverages or put ice into the glass. VERY STRANGE! We really liked the shape and feel, but would not buy again! However, they were an experience!"
2,crisa Impressions,Glasses are very nice; sadly they do chip in dishwasher.great price makes up for this.
1,Dangerously fragile,"I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive. I placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use, and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done. I then checked Amazon's reviews, and found that this was a common experience. They're going back to the store tomorrow."
4,Very classic!,"Very classic beautiful. Good item to have when your entertaining. Do more than what it was designed for!!!!""! Elegance, classicis, most used glasses in my house!!!!"""
1,They All Broke!,"In 11 months, we broke 16 glasses. Do not buy. Glasses are pretty but they don't do you any good if they are broken?"
1,Fragile,"Beautiful and solid, but I have never seen or heard of a set of glasses that break so easily. Literally, these will crack simply from going through the dishwasher. We've hardly abused them and less than a year later we have to buy a whole new set. If you intend to hand-wash, enjoy, but otherwise they won't last long at all."
1,Your reviews must be fake-Can't Believe this Item is for sale,"It doesn't break, chip, or even discolor, but the base has a compound kick (depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside. This makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside.Why hasn't any one noticed? Where's the reviews? I own a dishwasher (gee-) and this is a very irritating function-having to drain the glass, dry again, and place in my cabinent-geez!Don't buy it unless you have maids and butlers. The again don't buy it because they'll get miffed too!"
2,Beautiful.....if you intend to never use them.,"These glasses look great. They have lovely curves. Unfortunatly, my set didn't last 3 months! They would break very easily. Often I would find broken shards of the glass in the sink after I had finished doing the dishes. I didn't even have a dishwasher. I was washing them by hand. So, if you choose them.....wash with rubber gloves.....several pairs."
2,They break and chip easily...,Washed them in the dishwasher and have tried washing them by hand. Unfortunately these glasses seem prone to breaking easily with hot water.Unfortunately I never learned how to clean dishes in cold water.
2,"Looks great, but cracks/breaks easily","I completely agree with the rest of the reviewers here; these glasses are gorgeous-looking -- simple yet chic -- BUT they break extremely easily. Rapid temperature changes seem to be the key, at least from my experience: I've had them crack and break at the base just by hand-washing them w/ hot water. Also, if you take them out of a hot dishwasher into a much cooler kitchen too soon after the cycle, they can break (again, at the base). All of this within the first couple of months after purchasing them.I liked the way these look and feel so much that I bought two sets of the short tumblers, but I now have only 4 or 3 completely intact glasses from the original 8. Although they're quite aesthetically pleasing and the price seems right at first glance, I suggest buying a sturdier glass set that won't have to be replaced w/in a few months despite careful handling."
3,Great glasses,"I love these glasses. They fit so perfectly in your hand when you hold them. I bought some for our office. I would love to buy some for home but I only want the 16 1/2 oz ones. Unfortunately, it looks like they have now packed them so you can only get the completely clear ones in sets with the smaller glasses. Do they do this because they know that no one would buy the smaller glasses unless they had to? Until they change this policy and let me buy just the larger ones, I'll stick with what I currently have. I would have rated them a 5 star if I could get the larger glasses by themselves."
2,Glass looks sturdy,"Most of the glasses came in-tact but two of them were broken. I'll be calling Amazon and see if they can ship two more glasses or I may have to return them and wait for new ones.The smaller glasses seem a bit more sturdier than the bigger ones..Again, for $22.49 I was hoping to get more value for money..The glasses have a slight bend(dent) and that gives you a good grip to hold onto..Update: Called Amazon and they said they would be sending another shipment. Its great Amazon is standing behind its products"
5,Crisa Impressions glassware,I love this set. The base of the glassware is thick and heavy which helps prevent the glass from tipping over when bumped. I also like the indentations on the side. This helps to keep a grip on the glass when it is wet.
4,Great Glasses,"I was skeptical about buying these glasses as a lot of the reviews posted here mention that they are easily breakable. I've been using them for a couple of months now and they're working out great for me. I dont have to take any special care of em, just use em and stick em in the dishwasher and they come out fine.Really nice looking too, got tons of compliments."
2,Awful-don't buy!,"These disks come without a paper backing! Instead, some idiot decided that they should be continuously joined with a 2"" wide strip of plastic . Incredibly poor idea. So dust get all over the unused ones, or, as I tried, I put them in a zip-lock, which just made the last one, the one you want, stick to the bag. Awful, awful, awful!!!"
4,Roobok Sports Shoes for Men,"There had been a two-month search for this style of Roobok men's sports shoe. Located on Amazon, made purchase and the product was delivered within a few days - on time. Size was right and my husband was happy with the purchase."
2,lasted 45 days before shredding,not particularly comfortable. Worse problem is the toe/sole pealed open after less than two months of light usage. I would buy another Reebok. This is a sad offering compared to 25 years ago quality.
5,perfect sneakers,"i ordered these sneakers for my husband and he loves them. he wears them every day, all day long. they are very comfortable."
4,Classic C resize,"I have owned a pair or two of these at a time for the last 14-16 years. I have two pairs now in older condition. I love 'em. The new pair I just recieved seemed to have a manufacturing flaw. These are the first I've ever ordered online. Both shoes seem small and I have same foot size last 40 years. The right is tight but the left is unbearably tight like it is a size 9 (I'm 10 1/2). Wierd. I tried for 3 weeks to hopefully break them in but can't stand it anymore. Amazon said send it back for a refund, so here they go. I will order another pair 'cause I like them that much. White reeboks are so retro, like me."
2,Very narrow,"I had to wear a ""B"" width as a child but as an adult have been wearing a medium, or ""D"" width, comfortably. I decided to try the New Balance because they were more affordable than the P W Minors I have worn for years. When these arrived I found I could not get them on because they were so narrow. I was very disappointed to not be able to even try these shoes and had to return them. I think it should be noted in the description of these shoes that they are narrow and need to be compensated for when ordering sizes."
4,Good quality shoes,"I have purchased these shoes before and they last a long time. The only negative thing is that the medium size isn't wide enough for my feet and I don' t think they come any wider. If a person is looking for a wider shoe, do not purchase these in a medium as they may be to tight."
2,Very narrow,I have bought Reebok classic for few years because of the comfort. These were more narrow then pumas out of the box. Looked good like always but very uncomfortable. Worn them for a week and still narrow.
5,Good shoe!!!,This is my 2nd purchase for the same shoe. I bought the 1st one a year ago. Served as my tennis shoe twice a week. Very satisfy with the durability. Pick a bigger size as the shoe is smaller than the size it supposed to be as most people suggested.
2,Man Made,I like this model of Reeboks and am still wearing my older pair to work outside etc.When I received this new pair they looked like they came from a discount chain. I was expectingall leather uppers. These are very little leather and mostly man made materials. To mysurprise ! They were made in Vietnam where I guess they can be made cheaper. Whathappen to quality 1st Reebok ?? Very Dissapointed and will never buy again ! Waste of money.
2,Disappointed,Why in the world would guys send me two different leg... the right leg of the shoe is smaller than the left. I can't wear the shoe for a long. I'd stained it before I realized that its too small. I would love to return this shoes... but I can't because I stained it... terrible service.
5,"Reebok Club C Tennis Shoe is my favorite casual shoe, then later when 1/2 worn it becomes my work shoe.","The Reebok Club C Tennis Shoe is my favorite casual shoe then when it gets about half worn becomes my work shoe. I have been wearing the Club C shoes for probably close to 23 years or more. They last and hold up very well. I hope they continue to make this shoe as it is a quality made shoe. Years ago I had tried other shoes but was not satisfied untill I bought the Reebok Club C I could not be happier.I will continue to purchase this shoe as it is a quality made shoe, holds up well and is a long lasting/wearing shoe no matter wheather used in a casual environment or work environment. It has a quality clasic look with style that is always in fashion and when it gets a more scuffed & ruffed worn appearance it is ready to go to work for a comfortable hard working work shoe 8 to 5."
2,sizing seems off,"I ordered these 1/2 size too big to ensure they would fit and with no return. They seem to be the right size, but there is a defect ofmr something in the way they are made. They really hurt my feet when I wear them. I went to a rebok outlet and tried some that were just fine. Better luck next time"
2,shoe way too narrow,too narrow 2 narrow return was easy enough but there were no wide sizes to buy so the choice was't very good
2,wrong size,"bought this shoe a few weeks ago, it finally arrived here in the Bahamas , but it was the wrong size.I wear a size 10.5 and the shoe that i got was about a 9.5/10, although it said 10.5. i'm now In the process of ordering a size 11 after i just sold the other ones to a friend.BE CAREFULL!!!!! ORDER A SIZE BIGGER..."
2,Should have tried them at the store,"When I opened the box, I thought for sure I had received a narrow size by mistake. After examining them, they only had a ""12"" on the shoe and the box with no width designation, so I assume they are considered ""medium"", but let me tell you, they are far from any medium I have worn. This is an obvious reason why one should try shoes on in a store before buying them on the internet - especially if it is something they haven't worn previously, or in a long time.The quality of the shoe is also sub-par in my opinion. On one shoe, the toe upper is sewn crooked and makes a strange folded crease in the leather when I wear it. After wearing New Balance for years, these simply seem cheap - and I don't just mean inexpensive (which they are).Bottom line for me is ill fitting, uncomfortable and inconsistent quality shoes equal a lesson learned in shoe buying."
2,wrong size,"Simply received the wrong size. I'm not sure who's at fault, Amazon or Reebok. I've been wearing this 'Gym Coach' sneaker for years and always bought it at Modells and always got the same size. The pair Amazon sent was too small. Returned these OK, but who needs the hassle? Next time I'll be trying on sneakers before buying."
2,Quality has decreased over time,"I have been wearing these shoes for years. I really like the classic look and overall make of the shoes. However, the ones that I received from Amazon seem to be made to less standards than others I have bought in stores over the year. Some of the seams look flimsy and in fact are splitting after only a few wears. Also, there was a scuff on the top of the right shoe when I received it. The laziness in me prevented me from returning the shoes, but the quality needs to get better or I will be finding a new go-to shoe in the future."
3,They are okay,They are easy to scratch up and they shape to your feet . Wouldn't recommend due to this and lack of durability.
1,crushed toes,"I have been a pleased consumer of Reebock tennis shoes for many years. They fit me well and wore reasonably long until I purchased these Club C shoes in February. What I thought was break-in discomfort turned out to be a sizing problem and though they are ordered and marked 11D as I have worn for years, they crushed my toes to the point of a bruise under the large toe nail. They are definitely missized, wrongly marked or whatever. Reebock has lost me as a customer and the replacement New Balance shoes I bought were ordered at size 11D and fit as size 11D just as one should expect to experience. NO MORE REEBOCKS FOR ME! They apparently cannot control their manufacturers quality of the products. They owe me for my pain, suffering and loss of Tennis Pleasure."
3,Reebok men's tennis shoe,"Love the look, but found it to be too tight......not anyone's fault, he needed a wider width and it wasn't available....."
3,The friggin shoes were not wide enough,"The shoes were not wide enough. I believe they are probably good shoes, but again, not wide enough. I hope this helps.RWBarrett@aol.com"
4,Great shoes!!!,I bought these Reeboks for my hubby for Christmas. He LOVES them - says they are the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn. He wants to buy another pair for work. Would definitely buy again.
4,Good shoes,The size 8 1/2 shoes I bought fit well and feel good. I have no problem recommending them.
3,eh,"These shoes are decent, but they are very tight and their kinda shaped weird in the front. Other than that their fine."
1,"Cheap look, poor quality","The shoe is looks cheap , anf poor quality, I made mistake of the way picture show, but I received it, that cheap shoe, shoe more like for children."
2,runs small,"The pair I received was running really small or was sized wrong. I have a pair of these in 10 M and they fit great, were very comfy and are worn out. This pair of 10 M was so small, I had to return them and pay return postage."
3,Not what they use to be.,My husband says that they are not very comfortable. He has been buying the same T. shoes for years. This time they just don't feel right or feel good. They feel cheep on his foot.
3,Not for arch problems,Insoles are permanently glued in so that orthotics can not be installed. Insoles in shoes give no arch support.Returned them
5,Reebok Men's Club Sneaker,These never go out of style and great for those with wider feet who like a good lightweight comfortable sneaker! This was shipped quickly and well packed. Would recommend this seller and would purchase from them again as transition was so smooth.
3,Good looks but..,I read a couple of other similar reviews. The shoes which I bought where a bit too narrow for my feet.After using it for a couple of times they fit ok.
5,reebok mens sneakers,My husband has always worn these Reeboks. It is getting harder to find them in stores. You usually have to order them. These are very well made at a great price. definitely would recommend!
1,Worn out and unwearable after 50 uses,I think most people will review items as soon as they arrive. Unfairly giving most items a better rating than they truly deserve. The true test should be after a long use of the item. I purchased these sneakers approximately one year ago. They were quite comfortable at first but wore out very quickly. After wearing them 50 or so times in the last year for just casual day to day use the interior heal began to wear out. A piece of hard plastic began rubbing against my heal making them impossible to wear any further. I expected far more use and comfort out of them. I definitely would NOT recommend these shoes.
1,to small,I ordered a half size larger from reading the reviews about the shoew being to small. Couldn't even get them on my foot. They are going back.
5,Great for a gift!,I purchased this as gift for my sister. She was really surprised and enjoyed the movies. Good movies at a great price!
3,thank you,"My girls love this four pack of moies you picked. There was fantesy, humor, reality and even a little crasy."
4,hilarious,I dont know spanish...so this is my only form..and it is so funny. especially with friends who understand you and talk back(but you dont know what they're saying). get this book!
1,Got a bottle full of broken glass,"I was pretty happy with my purchase of five boxes of this stuff until I tilted back one of the vials and felt something chunky. I reflexively swallowed, but immediately spat out the remainder. That's where I found two rather sizable chunks of glass that had fallen into my mouth! I am going to report the company making these to the FDA. The seller is not to blame, and hopefully this is a one of a kind incident but I through out four boxes unopened and the remainder of the first box I opened and would not ever risk using them again."
1,Bait and Switch,"Ordered 20 year old. UPC on the back of the box says 20 year old. Box itself says 6 years old. Bottom line, I was sold a false product."
3,"A little better, still room for improvement","If you read my review about the ginseng w/Royal Jelly product, you already know where I'm headed with this. Ya see, I've found ROYAL KING to be THE best so far. And, they offer the highest amount of ginseng in their products. Plus-the taste is so great. This product scores a three, because it's just a little better. Perhaps a fusion of the 1000mg.(of ginseng)w/Royal Jelly product is in order of this very product. As this product clocks in at about 5000mg.(ginseng)I'm not playin with anything less, from now on."
5,Wow! Even better than the original,"After playing the first Descent for a number of years, I decided to upgrade. Unbelievable! The graphics are awesome, the sounds fantastic and incredible enemies! I can't wait for a Descent 4! It just keeps getting better & better!"
5,Descent 3,"Amazon.com RULES! I always find excellent deals here, including the bundled jewel case set! That also explains why I've bought so much here and keep coming back."
5,5 star gaming,"I never played, or are playing, this game just looking at the box seems like the best game I have ever looked at through a window. I would like to play this game but have no money. If you would like to but this game for me just leave another review titled ""5 star gaming"" and your E-mail address."
2,Out of print for a reason.,"Although it did use it in preparing for my GRE, I don't think it added much to my score. The software is very outdated and not very useful. It's better to get one of the brand new programs available on CD. It's not even worth [what I paid], second-hand."
2,Way too short!,"This was definitely an erotic story. Hot gladiators, and Roman depravity make an exiciting mix. And, as it dealt with slavery, I expected rape. However, I was disappointed that that was all there was. Plus, this was a VERY short book, 109 pages with slightly large type. A novella. This will teach me not to look at the page count. This is not to say novellas can't be worth the money (""Cat Toy"" by Ilian Obidian was well worth the $10)Gladiator Magnus finds himself longing to free twin boys from abusive slavery (and have them himself, of course). Which begs the question what would they do together if they could get free? The reader never finds out. The book's conclusion, while not a screaming cliffhanger, ends just as things could've gotten really hot, not to mention have a storyline.So, considering how short it is, I would NOT recommend paying $10+ for this. If you can borrow it, or get it used cheap, it was worth a quick read-but not worth buying."
3,Great Erotica - but not much more!,"OK, I honestly enjoyed this book. Very short, only 109 pages, and filled with lots of gay sexual encounters. Some reviewers have mentioned it's literary value, and sadly, I must admit that there is none here. It's a good piece of erotica, and if sex is what you are looking for, you won't miss with this one. Sex 10, literary value 2."
4,Easily Read Enjoyable Mystery,"On the whole this is mystery, not at all humorous, and no more romantic than are most mysteries. The heroine is a mass of contradictory emotions reflective of the conflicts which are basic to the story. She and her cousin, who shares the spotlight in the book, have their problems, which unfold with the turning of pages. Both have had romances which went sour, both have Secrets which they fear to have revealed. There is the usual extended foreplay for the heroine while the romantic situation for the jilted cousin is less clear. The obligatory sexual scenes are quite brief and..... I can't say without telling what should be withheld.The author writes well, providing the average reader with some good characterizations and action which is intriguing (if somewhat confusing at times). I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers who like to get involved with what in this book are Two Ladies in Distress."
5,Love Stephanie Bond mysteries,I have read all of the Evanovich mysteries and all of the Grafton mysteries and was searching for a new author.....found her...Stephanie Bond is pretty darned close to filling the bill. Keep up the great work Stephanie.....and thank you!
5,Got your number,Really enjoyed this book. I will be reading more of Stephanie Bond's books. Easy read. Lots of twist and turns
5,"Funnneeee, Stephanie Bond is!!","Loved this book, not quite up to ""Our Husband"", but still extraordinary.Stephanie Bond is one of the brightest and funniest authors today.I have not found any other authors in the genre with her degree of talent and humor."
3,another classic .,"Stephanie Bond does not dissapoint in this novel, full of humour romance and mystery with zany characters a good read."
4,They're in Love?,"I really enjoyed this book, but it's not much of a romance. It's full of sexy and sinister secrets, compelling hints and lots of humor. I found Roxann and Joe completely likeable and respectable. Unfortunately, there is such a little part in this book for Joe and she is so good at blocking the few advances he makes that when she and Joe fall in love, you find yourself asking, ""Where was I?"" But buy the book, anyway. Stephanie Bond moves the story forward at a good clip and with firm control, keeping you reading and wondering and feeling fairly satisfied that all the pieces of her complex puzzle fit so nicely together. All but the romance."
4,Fun Read,The characters in this book were likable and fun to follow. They lead you on an adventure so you wanted to know what was going to happen to them next. I have recommended this to a friend that reads a lot. We are both active senior citizens who like a good romantic adventure.
4,Cute and fun. A very easy read.,"What I liked most about this book is the twists that inherent in it. The author begins taking the reader down one road and then there is a twist. I caught a few of them, but there were two that eluded me till the end. Loads of fun. A very easy read. I recommend it. I enjoyed it. I will be loaning to fellow Kindlers."
4,Ever made the wrong decision for the right reason?,"Roxann certainly has and now it's come back to haunt her. Of course it's hard to tell what exactly it is that's come back since there seems to be multiple issues. The issues are all solved, in part with the help of Detective Joe Capistrano and the guidance of an eight ball.Loved the pepperspray scene. Lot of threads throughout but they come together nicely."
2,One out of three...,"This is billed as a ""humorous romantic mystery."" I got through five chapters and hadn't yet found anything remotely humorous or romantic. There was a minor mystery, but by that time I disliked the main character so much that I didn't care if she solved it. I skipped ahead and read the last chapter, which cleared up the mystery in a really lame way and I didn't feel like I missed anything in all the chapters I skipped."
4,A must read,This story is a good mystery read and has a great message...sometimes fate takes you where you need to be and not where you thought you would end up...
4,Good light reading,"When I pick this type of novel I just want my brain to shut off from my problems and go down a little path with a good story. This book fit the bill exactly. I was entertained, the characters were likable, the story was great, there was that little build up and a little bit of suspense and it all tied up at the end. I have recently discovered Stephanie Bond and I really enjoy her style. I'll definitely be a repeat customer."
3,Mirka 220 Grit,"These discs work OK as long as the surface is bare wood. If there is any finish on the wood they tend to clog up very fast especially pine or spruce. The Norton discs last longer although it does depend on the type of grit that is applied to the disc. I have switched to the Norton 5"" discs for my sanding projects.JJK"
5,Helps with tick bites too,"We've been using Ssssting-stop for years, too. As others have said, it's best if applied soon after the bite, but helps with itching and inflammation even later. We live in an area with ticks, and it helps ease itching and swelling even on those bites -- for the dogs as well as for us.It does have a strong herbal odor. When I first put it on the dog's tick bite, she didn't like the smell and tried to get away. After a couple of times, she learned that it helped: after I removed the tick she'd wait expectantly to get the treatment! Worth the smell."
5,works great,It gets rid of the itchiness with no big red welts afterward like with the diphenhydromine or benzocaine products. A+
5,Better Homes and Gardens Step by Step Complete Cookbook,I received the book in time for my father's birthday and it was everything that was promised. The book was in great condition as promised and shipped promptly. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone looking to buy a book.
4,thought provoking and musically excellent,"From the cover jacket, it is extremely obvious that the viewer is in store more much more than the traditional ""Hoffmann."" Initially, I wasn't convinced by the staging concept as I am sure many traditional fans of the opera were put off. However, the longer I watched, the more feasible the characterizations became. The innate question the production begs is intriguing: would ETA Hoffmann be perceived as less than sane in modern society? To that end, the story fits surprisingly well in the asylum context. Musically, the cast is suberb and presents many of the foremost french singers of our time. Although probably not for the die-hard traditionalists, this performance is definately worth trying out for those who are interested in re-discovering one of the most beautiful French operas of all time."
1,The production is awful.,"Not only did I not like the production, I was offended by it. It really took away from so much of what I like about Hoffman.The music was wonderful but I agree with the other reviewers, I would rather have heard it on a CD than watch it. I will get rid of my copy when I can get another Hoffman on DVD.I thought the singer that sang Hoffman looked like Andy Kaufmann but sang like a god. I also enjoyed Olympia's voice a lot."
2,Interesting but who needs it,"If you love the opera and want to see it in any of the dozens of versions that are more or less what Offenbach had in mind, do NOT buy this DVD. If you're interested in the opera and ready to spend a few dollars on a very different version (among many other changes, much abbreviated), you can take a risk on this. But my guess is that very few people will watch it more than once."
2,I regret to have bought this one,"Don't buy it. The interpretation is not good at all and very annoying. Natalie Dessay has put before its prestation in very unconfortable position for nothing. In act I, the singers are wondering how to deal with their body ... All is poor quality even these singer usually are very good especially Natalie Dessay. A bad producer does a bad operaSorry for my bad English"
2,Grim and surrealistic staging destroyed enjoyment of music.,"If you have enjoyed the romantic settings and colorful costumes of other production of Tales of Hoffmann, this version is not for you. The whole opera is set in a grim, grey insane asylum of some sort with drab costumes and no furnishings beyond a few chairs and a ubiquitous rolling cart. The vocal perfromances are quite good, and the use of black artists very appropriate and interesting, but you may find yourself distracted by questions such as: why are so many of the characters bald, or why do they keep exchanging coats? If you enjoy really avaunt guarde productions, you may like this. Myself, I'm going to look for a more traditional staging."
2,painful and obscure,"The mathematics of finance is not trivial, but neither is it really all that difficult; nevertheless, Duffie works to make you think that it is.I maintain a scale of good versus bad mathematics writing in my head, against which I calibrate books I read. This scale stretches from, at one end, the faculty of Moscow University, in particular Israel Gelfand, Vladimir Arnold and Andre Kolmogorov, all of whom manage to explain to me hard things so that they seem easy, to, at the other, Darrell Duffie."
4,A tricky book,"This book, whilst being very impressive i didn't really find helpful as a learning tool. A good knowledge of the subject is required otherwise it is almost impossible to follow.I'm studying a masters in finance, and would say it goes well beyond what we need to know for such a course. Maybe maths & finance students would cover things in this.I am amazed that people actually use such a comllicated book in practice!!"
2,Assumes a lot,"This is a good book if you are already a runner of some experience. If you're not, it may not be for you. The book assumes that you already know a fair amount about running and training. If you don't, then this book is likely to be quite confusing for you."
2,"Better Choices, especially if you are new.","This book was very disappointing, not only in it's content, but also in its production. The content is not as organized as some of the other books on the market (Glover, Theil) and seems to gloss over a lot of fundamentals. If you are new to the sport, I would strongly advise another book as following this could lead you to injury. If you are more experienced, there are some concepts and suggestions that you could benefit from, but still look at options.The production of the book is another issue: Pages stuck together and several pages were placed in the wrong order, missing and duplicated. Frankly, if the publisher's qualtity is not that up to par, it damages one's faith in the quality of the content."
4,Hirt's--a trustworthy seller (Olive tree),"The olive tree I received was also quite small (as to be expected for the price). I am not exactly certain how I am going to train this tree because there are two equally-sized tiny branches on a kind of crooked base. Also, it is really taking a long time to get going, but hopefully it will finally take root and take off. Quality product, but just small and taking its time acclimating.Having sad this, however, I must say that I have ordered numerous plants from Hirt's over the last two-three years and have always been pleased with their timeliness and product."
3,Olive tree,I ordered two trees. One died almost immediately despite me taking care of them exactly the same and by the dicections. THe one that survived is doing ok so far. We will see what happens.
4,Nice so far.,"I bought my tree last year (probably around May/June 2011 or so) and it's been doing pretty well. Like falcomyun's review, I was a bit confused with the way the actually plant looked: one teeny little stump, with two thin branches growing from it with leaves all along the length of the branch. Unfortunately a year later only one branch has really took off and grown nicely. The other one just sort of stopped. I'm also unsure how to trim it to make it look a bit nicer. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Overall, shipping was great. The tree was packed carefully and arrived healthy. Almost a year later and it's still going strong, frequently getting new growth. I just wish it looked nicer like some of the user photographs."
5,amazing!,"I was a bit skeptical, ordering a plant from Ohio.... but these 2 small olive trees arrived in perfect condition. Great packing, as not one leaf was broken.Thanks!"
5,Healthy Olive Tree,"I just got my 4"" pot tree, and I have to say that I am delighted with it!The tree arrived in healthy condition, and well packaged to prevent shifting in the box. It's slightly taller than the 12"" quoted at, but that's nice :)Overall it looks like the tree is very healthy, and it arrived in great time."
4,Why it's so strange?,"My tree came with good condition a month ago, I really like its little leaves. BUT why it just has two branches? It grows well, on of the branches is very long and slim now. It's a little ugly. I don't know how to trim it, maybe I should cut the long one."
3,ti was what i expected,"i made my purchase on oct.6 2012 and got it on oct12 well packetge no bug no dead lafs or anything bad IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE ,but its well develop it was 21 1/2 inches when i got it and i waited 2 days to transplant on a bigger pot as of nov.9 2012 is 231/2 inches with a new leafs.it did not had any branches and dont know if i will get some when bigger but nice product for the price i have seen olive tree 3 foot tall go for 50 dollars so its all good."
3,not as large as I though,My tree have only one long twig. So I think the provided picture is some kind of misleading. But the plants that I bought is packed quite good.
3,Good,"I like this tree, but I thought it would come with a nice pot- it doesn't. Anyway, it's a nice tree, and be sure to know it produces little or no olives"
3,Not Sure Yet,"Not sure how to rate this yet. I just received this plant opened the box and had to go straight outdoors. There are little bugs flying all around the tree and the 3 leaves on it, 1 is dried brown and the other two have a white substance on it. I will rate later if the plant survives."
5,Loved this little tree!,Beautiful little tree. Arrived in great shape just begging to be potted and become part of my botonical family.Will order again.Price was incredibly reasonable.

2,Hindenberg?,"As a working sportswriter, like myself, the author should know that there is not a single player in today's NBA who would knock an opponent to the court, then utter the words: ""You went down harder than the Hindenberg!"" I doubt whether there is a single active pro basketball player that could even identify the Hindenberg, let alone use it as a taunt. (Who edited this novel?)That sort of preposterous dialog -- and the hackneyed romance between Dee and her coach -- made it difficult to fully to enjoy Lupica's well-intentioned little fantasy."
3,Not as good as Bump & Run,"After howling in Bump and Run, I couldn't wait to listen to Full Court Press.The first half of the book continues at a great pace with a slew of colorful characters. The last half was a let down. I enjoyed it, however, it wasn't as crisp as Bump and Run.With that being said, I would still recommend either buying or listening to this story."
5,Andrews Sisters are great,"First heard Andrews Sister on the Big Band station and fell in love with them. I'm in my mid 40's and this is the music I wish I had grown up with. You want uplifting happy music listen to these ladies, they will make any day a great day."
5,Andrews Sisters,If your looking for old forties music at it's best this is the album to buy. Their harmonies are just perfect even if we are talking old hi-fi style.
2,not so good,"knowing the quality or writers that the new yorker supported for many years, i had high expectations for white's work. it was a dissapointment. the poems were flat and fell short, and try as he did, he could not create the humor found in dorothy parker's poems. the sketches, for the most part, were meant to be humourous, but were not. there were a few good ones in the final section of the book, but if you want to read the finest that the new yorker produced, read john cheever's and dorothy parker's work."
2,Did not fit well,"This shoe did not fit well. The tongue of the shoe is way too long and hits the top of the foot making it uncomfortable. Again, I didn't appreciate paying the return shipping."
1,Did not live up to expectations,"Initially, they were not very comfortable. After I wore them for a month or so they got broken in and were very comfortable. Just around the time they became comfortable the soles seperated from the body of the shoe. From the looks of things it looks like the soles were just clued on. Maybe it is constructed that way to make it easier to resole. This is the second pair of resolable (sp) Mephisto shoes I have had this happen to. Generally speaking I like Mephisto shoes. I especially like the Mobils. I stay away from the ones that can be resoled."
2,Shoes squeak when I walk,"I initially like this shoe very much; however, they have begun to squeak constantly within the last ten days. I have exceeded the return period for the shoes. Very disappointing. I'm wondering if I bought seconds since the shoes sold for 50% off."
5,best of the best,I haven't actually worn this pair yet but the pair I have is 15 years old and I still wear them. They are extremely comfortable and sturdy. I would highly recommend them as a comfort shoe.
4,Libbey Radiant 16 piece Beverage Glass Set,"Because of a vast variety of company that comes through my home, this glass will serve as a classy but functional addition. The beveled glass is a plus for holding on to."
2,not what I expected,"While these sanding disks are ""self adhesive"", they have no backing. The come stacked in a pile and you just peel the top one off before you stick it on the sander. Do they work? Yes they do. You cant really grab a few and throw them in your tool box because of no backing. I am also concerned that the adhesive will dry out before I use up the 100 I bought because they have no backing.If I knew this was how they were being sold I would not have bought them,,,, unless they were about half the price I paid."
3,Provocative but Frustrating,"In this accessible and interesting book, Gazzaniga offers persuasive evidence to support his premise that the brain makes choices and begins to act before we are consciously aware of the fact. He suggests that an ""interpreter"" in the brain's left hemisphere constructs a coherent narrative of consciousness after the fact, which provides us with an illusion of free will. However, the evidence for the existence of this interpreter is strictly (if powerfully) circumstantial, and Gazzaniga never offers details as to where specifically he thinks the interpreter is located, how it would have evolved, and how specifically it functions. I also felt that his condescending attitude toward those who disagree with him kept him from seeing their evidence, and interfered with the effectiveness of his own argument."
2,The Mind's Gone,"If this is modern neuroscience...you can keepit.The author says he doesn't understand quantum physics...heck, he doesn't understand aanything except Newtonian mechanics and Darwinian happenstance. The only useful item in the book is his claim to have found an ""interpreter"" in the left hemisphere of the brain, which he sneeringly suggests gives you a (false?) sense of self.This may help real psychology to root out a mess of linear confusion masquerading as ""The Mind""."
3,Good fit and comfortable but could be better,"These shoes were purchased for my son who is seriously into Taekwondo. They fit well, are comfortable, and hold up well.The reason for 3-stars is based on laces that are placed at the direct point of impact when performing many Taekwondo kicks and the knot/bow point hurts his foot with every kick. The shoe tongue could have used more padding, or better yet, a design without laces is best for this martial art."
3,Pine Tree Low Cut Black Martial Arts Shoe,"Shoes are fine, but for reasons I don't understand, the order didn't go out for over a week after I put it in. There was NO indication this would be the case before I ordered. If I had needed the shoes quickly, this would have been a major issue. As it was, I could wait, but I didn't appreciate the delay. And the shipping charges -- given that I clearly got nothing even remotely resembling ""RUSH"" or ""OVERNIGHT"" -- were extremely high. I say, ""Shoes nine, shipping three."""
1,GODAWFUL,Groovy premise. Asinine story. I can't believe this thing won some prize (I can't remember which) for best scifi novel of the year. I want my money back from those judges.
1,Interesting.....,"A writer for the lost, troubled, souls that walk the earth. A must have for the heathen and closed minded. A bible for those that know the truth but fear it. I highly recomend it for anyone who wants to turn their eyes from the truth."
1,NO WAY,"I dont really see whats so funny about making fun of Jehovah.He is the god that created us all, and people still think its funny when authors come up with these lies and rediculous stories about him and his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON jesus christ"
4,Hard to define.,"It's a comedy. It's a drama. It's a social commentary on religion, sexuality and tabloid journalism. It's a heartwarming inspiration. It's a knee-slapping satire.The story is riveting, with plenty of unexpected turns to keep the reader guessing what Morrow has up his sleeve. But the real hallmark here is in characterization; the author has created incredibly believable people here despite the incredible premise."
4,Interesting,"What an interesting book! It will throw you through a couple of loops and you might even find yourself asking ""what the heck just happened?"". but don't you worry it is a good book. Well worth the read!"
4,Different,"I really enjoyed this story, though I didn't think it was as blatantly humorous as I thought it would be. However it brings up some really good issues about faith.It's also not really so much of an attack on god as it is on the people who use religion for their own agenda.Jesus is actually portrayed as a caring person, yet he doesnt exactly appreciate xianity that much either."
3,Star Wars Empire Srikes Back Tie Bomber,"Great toy when seen through the advertisement. Unfortunately, when my son began to assemble it, the rear top door doesn't fit."
4,Newer version is better,"This is a good vehicle, but I thought I'd point out that there's a newer version released in 2010 that is an improvement in every way. You can check it out atStar Wars 2010 Clone Wars Exclusive Deluxe Vehicle Imperial Tie Bomber."
4,"Gorgeous pictures, too much detail","This book is beautiful -- it has incredibly clear photographs and other illustrations. The down side is it has way too much detail. I am a first year dental student, and I find this book pretty much impossible to read. It's probably somewhat readable for more advanced students/professionals, but it's definitely not for my level."
3,I like it's look,"The fit of 6 normal soda cans is very tight, you may actually be dragging metal against metal to get a normal 12 oz can out. In a car that was around 75 on a six hour trip, I found the performance acceptable but only marginally so. It would have been colder packed in ice. I don't think that performance is traceable to Rubber-maid, I think it's just the best this technology does in achieving a transference of heat from inside to out. If true, then larger units of this technology that hold more cans would have a very disappointing performance by comparison to this Rubber-maid. I recommend it but don't get the idea it will freeze your soda (even the can next to the device). It might have a better use keeping food (like sandwiches with Mayonnaise) from spoiling while sodas can still be best served in ice. Doing that keeps the dry goods dry too.It fits comfortably in the seat and looks better than others I've seen."
1,Don't rely on this to keep medications cool!,Bought this to keep meds cool on a long car trip in the winter. Didn't stay on for 24 hours in the back seat of the car. Don't trust it!
4,Works great for work,I work in an office and I use this at my desk to keep sodas cool. It does a great job and I'm very happy with it. You have to buy the adapter to use 110v outlet.Rubbermaid Mini-Console Warmer/Cooler #VEC 222RB
3,I would rate it as an average general book about the Bible,"Sofer has a liberal bent. For example; instead of miracles he attributes the burning bush and parting of the Reed Sea to natural phenomena. Also, perhaps it's a gender thing but, the aspects he chose to elaborate upon were not the ones I found interesting."
5,Outstanding,This is a much needed book for Christians. I wish I could memorize it so that I could could say why I believe what I believe in an articulate manner like Dr. Lutzer
5,Decent quality,"These seem to be pretty solid, and last longer than some I've used. Price also decent, compared to local stores at least."
1,mirka sand paper,"I would never buy any mirka products again! I bought a 50 count of 120 grit 6"" 6 hole and Im wearing them out in under 5 minutes of sanding! Do yourself a favor and buy Sunmight instead"
3,not bad for the 'sale' price,"not bad for the price. Seem to wear out fairly fast, but compaired to other comparable sanding discs I would say they are acceptable."
4,More than just a hockey book,"My 6 year old son is a big sports fan and even bigger hockey fan. Even though he did not know Gretzky before reading this book, he loved the story from the first read. After hearing stories from his Dad about the Great One, he loved the book even more. I am very happy with my choice."
5,The Magic Hockey Stick Book,I Love reading this book to my grandson who loves hockey.That is all I have to say as I am not a very wordy person.
3,Expensive and mediocre,"The product feels and smells great, but so far I'm not impressed because of the price. I don't think it's any better than a drugstore pomade as far as results are concerned (I have thick kinky curly hair). However, it seems to have a lot of quality ingredients."
1,not satisfied,I don't like this at all. It smells funny and it is greasy and it doesn't do anything for my hair besides weighing it down. Now I have weighed down hair that is frizzy. Do not recommend at all.
1,Would NOT Recommend It,"I really don't understand the high ratings here, which prompted me to purchase this product. It did nothing for my hair in the humidity and functioned like any other hair ""grease"". The container is small and expensive and not worth purchasing. FYI - I have natural, pressed, African hair and it reverted to curly within an hour of the Miami humidity hitting my hair. It got even worse once the Jamaican weather reached it. Once my hair was curly again, it also did nothing to tame frizz."
1,Did nothing,"My hairdresser recommended this. Its a waste of money, and it is expensive. It did nothing for my hair. Morrocan Oil is much better."
2,What was I thinking,"I like the way my hair looks when I use this product. But the cost was outrageous in terms of value. I only use this once a week because I have to wash my hair at least 3 times to get the stink out. I actually went as far as adding Rose Oil to it to help take the stink away, but I can still smell it in my hair Sunday morning when I wake up. I have not gotten around to flat ironing my hair while using this to see how it would do with holding my hair straight but it does a good job keeping the frizz out of my hair. You just have to be able to like having your hair smell dirty and oily to use it often, otherwise you will have to wash your hair several times to get the smell out."
3,Interesante colección,"Esta edición de cuatro películas es muy interesante. El principal problema radica en que solo esta doblado en francés y no viene la edición en castellano de ninguna de las películas, donde solo podemos encontrarlas subtituladas, menos Papillon que está subtitulado en francés e inglés. Ahí si hubo un gran error de Warner."
4,It's a brake rotor,"It fits, and it stops my W body Pontiac. It would have been nice if it was coated to prevent rust, but I did that myself with cheap BBQ paint, hot soapy water, and a few hours one evening."
5,That's What I call (A Great Movie),"well.. when i read the review in a korean website.. I was kinda confused.. as i don't like gays stuff lol.. but when i watched that movie.. i thought: girls, u were going to miss such a great work becuz such a silly reason?? Thank God i had the carriege to watch it.. that movie is really great.. I can say, i consider it the best since 2000 (that was when i watched a movie with the same emotional effect)...the king and the clown.. really wonderful.. and lee jun ki was just like WAW!!!"
3,Good movie,"The King and the Clown goes back to 1504. It's a story of two men in love with each other and a gruesome king. Although I dont follow Cantonese, I quite liked the dialogues. I enjoyed the drama feel and being a period film, it does rather well. Had the film been a little more overdramatic and powerful, I'd have liked it more. It seems to sag, cause the characters seldom change, the end too predictable. Nonetheless, credit is worth to the actors and performers. Worth watching."
4,Great memories!,"This album provided some fun moments recalling songs from my childhood, particularly Beep Beep. Not sure if any of today's kids even know what a Nash Rambler is, so the humor of the song is probably lost on them. They just won't understand the smile on my face when I hear that song and some of the other fun tunes from the Playmates."
4,Which Beep Beep Is This?,"Beep Beep is indeed a classic. Not sure about the rest. Can someone tell me which ""Beep Beep"" is on this cd? The one I have, on the ""Bop Rock'N'Roll"" compilation is bowdlerized into being about a limousine and a bubble car. Rather than about a Cadillac and a Nash Rambler! Ruins the whole furschlugginer thing, if you ask me."
4,Great Comeback...,"I loved Carter's first book, but didn't care too much for her second book. This one is a great comeback for a talented author.Carter plays on the old adage ""birds of a feather flock together"" as she follows the lives of three close childhood friends into adulthood. The three friends are: Taylor, a woman who announced to the world she was gay at the tender age of 14. James, an aspiring politician who is engaged to Sara. Sara, who feels no passion for James.James and Sara call the wedding off afther they both discover new aspects of themselves throughout the telling of this masterful tale. Taylor is finally able to live her childhood dream. The only ""unreal"" part of this story is how James' and Sara's families react to the news. It's almost as though their families are comatose or heavily sedated, not ""normal"" (whatever that is).I'm now looking forward to Carter's next book. She's one writer you shouldn't miss."
4,High School Buddies,"Sara, James, and Taylor sitting in a tree. Who's kissing who?Sara and James are getting married and Taylor's been their friends since they were young. Sara and James were still her friends when she came out at 14.The wedding plans are not going well. When Taylor shows up sparks start flying and reality sinks in for all parties.Get all dressed up and join the wedding party for an interesting time. You'll enjoy this one."
3,Easy reading,"A romance about the relationship between three friends since high school, two women and a man. The romantic focus is on the two women.Taylor has known since she was fourteen that she was a lesbian. James and Sara, her friends, are fine with Taylor being a lesbian. James, the male friend and Sara are engaged to be married.James' family is pushing him toward a political future and Sara fits the family's plan nicely as the daughter of a well to do family.Things start to unravel when, yes, you guessed it, Sara acknowledges her feelings for her old friend, Taylor.James has a surprise up his sleeve to spring.There was a nice side story of an older lesbian couple and the mystery of hidden gold.Not a lot of character development. I didn't gel with any of them.No surprises in this story. I easily saw where this was going early in the story. Story flows and no mistakes. A nice story for a lazy afternoon without heavy angst, and a satisfactory ending."
2,Skipped over some parts,"To tell the truth, I struggled to finish this one and skipped over some parts. We get to spend too little time with Taylor, so the relationship development wasn't very deep."
4,Thoughtful romance,I enjoyed the book. It was not stuffed with sex. I enjoyed the historical storyline. It is a great lazy day read.
4,"Timeless, Familiar Tale with some Fact-Learning, too.","This durable, thick cross between a board book and a regular paged book for young children follows a familiar tale. Little penguin is born, doesn't follow parent's direction... gets temporarily lost... finds a wise creature of another sort who assists him in finding his way...begins losing feathers and then is refound and found out that losing his feathers is just perfect..Sounds like the lives of many of US, only in in Animal Sense as well as many other books and legends.The reason this book works is because it is timeless and you can engage any age child in conversation around the story, the illustrations, the situations the little Penguins is in which may be similar to the child's.I also learned a very fun fact right on the first two pages... so you might gain more than you think in reading this colorfully illustrated title."
4,"Book Was Great, Shipping Experience was Not","I have no complaint about the book itself. My shopping experience was very poor. I ordered two copies of the book, and only one was shipped. The packaging was covered with tire marks like it had been run over multiple times. I will be very careful about ordering books from this source in the future."
3,Tries to cover too much ground,"I was hoping for a book that focused on the 'real' experiences of a baby penguin, and the losing of the feathers does this, but the rest of the book is a bit diluted. The author tries to touch upon the baby being like its daddy and its getting lost, all while undergoing a physical transformation, but I would have preferred a more focused story. The encounters with other animals are extraneous, but I was hoping for something more informational than entertaining."
4,"OEM-like braking, better noise and dust","Performance-wise, I'd rate these pads around the same as the OEMs on my '02 VW. They are very quiet, and haven't noticed any dust so far, so if that's what you're looking for, they work great. For improved stopping power, however, you're probably going to want to keep looking."
5,"Work great, less wheel cleaning","I use these on my 02 VW jetta and 03 VW passat. These work perfectly and significantly reduce brake dust.I do not notice much braking performance difference vs stock/OEM semi-metalic pads in practice.As competition is increased nowadays in ceremic pads, you may want to compare newly intoduced alternatives. But these are (still) a great choice in terms of quality and performance, in the ""improved street"" category, and are just slightly more than semi-metalic OEM types."
1,Amazon is mistaken,I bought this set of back brakes for my 1999 Audi A6 after amazon said it is compatible with my vehicle. This set of brakes is NOT compatible at all and led to a very frustrating experience. Please please please do NOT take Amazon's word for it when they say it's compatible.
4,Great glasses with a durability problem,"Great glasses-Comfortable, light, I REALLY like the glass lenses- so much more durable than plastic!HOWEVER- the finish on the frame is ALREADY chipping!!!! I've owned them for less than a month!! I may be sending them back to Serengeti for that.Ed"
5,I don't want other sunglasses,"I bought these sunglasses 5 years ago. At that time I found them expensive, but I liked a lot the design (it is hard for me to find a sunglass that fits well). After five years I don't want any other sunglass: the photochromic and spectral selective properties of the glasses are amazing.Now I have lost them last month and I'm going to buy exactly the same ones again!"
5,Great!,These glasses are really professionally built; great for your eye I really love the Italian craftsmanship.Great buy!Grazie
4,Great picks,"These, as of right now, are my preferred picks. They are thin, very grip-able and maneuverable yet built good. They hold up to metal play pretty well but you will want at least the 1mm for heavy play. Very much recommend these, but I need a thicker version for what I play. You can play using any of the three corners, so they last 3 times as long as a regular sized pick."
3,photo album,"I like the cover - this is why I choose it to use for my daughters photos of her trip to Europe. However, the top and bottom of the pages com unglued very easily when you ""slide"" a photo in. I have ordered a second one as we need the space, but I am not happy about this problem."
1,Where is it?,Ordered 2 months ago and still have not received anything. How hard could it be to figure out how to speed up a subscription?
4,A good toy but not exact,The toy is actually perfect at standing and posing. It also comes with weapons which is great and flipable binoculars. What i'm worry about is the color of the figure. The color to to bright when you shine against the sun which kinda makes it look like a lego. but whenever you're at a [no sunlight area] the color looks exact. Other then that the figure is really great. Plus this figure is really rare to find in stores.
4,A scholarly but poetic history of earliest man,"Timewalkers examines the various theories of how humanity spread across the world. For such a work of scholarship, Gamble keeps things interesting with his quirky and nearly-poetic writing style. A vast amount of detail is processed, but never feels overwhelming. The earliest history of mankind is not an easy subject; there are many bits of evidence that don't always fit neatly together. Competing theories of how those bits might fit are examined, sometimes the results are conclusive, sometimes not, but the overall picture of prehistory is filled out. As a side note, for those with some doubts about evolution, this book will quell them. Many different aspects of Homo sapiens evolution are examined thoroughly, and the process is much clearer than when Darwin first developed the theory."
5,You Won't be Disappointed!!,"This was a Wonderful Surprise & I can't understand why it Doesn't have a Full 5 Star rating!! This book Combined with ""Marijuana Horticulture, The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible"" are the Only books you will need to have a Good Understanding of this subject.The Best of ASK ED is Wonderfully done. It's like having Your Own personal Specialist you can sit down & just start picking their mind for info. Done Very casually But don't underestimate Ed's knowledge!!! There were things in there I've never heard before BUT I'm Glad I know Now!! The pictures (although not Exceptional) are a Great help along the way. It a Fun book to read with larger print--Yeah!! I've got markers all over in this book!! Ed has been around the block a few times & he makes this a Fun But Educational delight.I Most Highly recommend this Book!!! When a question comes up, I say, lets ""Ask Ed"".....~Quillnink"
3,Revised for Cannabis Culture magazine,"This is Ed's old ""Ask Ed"" book which has been changed since he left High Times magazine to join Cannabis Culture magazine because of some legal battle with High Times magazine over the sharing of funds that where supposed to be left to members of the mag by the former editor who died under mysterious circumstances. This update is basically a deletion of any High Times related stuff in the old book with some new added Ask Ed columns from Cannabis Culture magazine. It is still a good book to have but Ed should concentrate on trying to do a new version of this book from start to finish. Nice update, just not that much updated really and was designed more to remove High Times references from the old version than anything else as far as I can see."
5,The Best of Ask Ed: Your Marijuana Questions Answered,EVERY question you have will be answered. The first book you should buy and read before you buy any others.
2,All photos are black & white making it difficult to see detail,"This book is the black and white version. The photos are poor quality copies, and very difficult to see the detail that Ed Rosenthal had intended on. Do not buy this book. Buy the color version, which is a very good book and the pictures beautiful."
3,"A fun read, but not nothing in depth.","I enjoy reading Ask Ed whenever I can find it and this book was fun to read. If you're looking for specific information, this is not your book. There are good questions, even specific questions, with some good answers however they are all written in a ""newspaper column"" format for those with a 10 second attention span. The other marijuana bible books are much better. Go spend your money on one of them instead: Jorge Cervantes or Greg Green are recommended reads!"
2,Defective Spray in Biofreeze Spray bottle,The spray feature does not work in the bottle I received. Ended up having to buy an empty spray bottle and pour product in it. For that reason alone I would not purchase Biofreeze in the Spray Formula again.
3,Hit and miss,"This collection of short horror stories is certainly a hit and miss affair - the 3 standout tales in the book are ""The Secret Shih-Tan"", ""Fairy Story"" and ""Suffer Kate"" - but even these are overly predictable. The rest of the stories fall below average. If you're looking for Masterton in his top form, this isn't the first place I'd recommend looking."
3,this book was good,This book was good you get to hear how things played out for other women who have gone before you. I also purchased a few other books to figure out what I was going to do. one of them was Divorce by Gloria JeanDivorceI feel buying these books helped me decide what I needed to do for myself.
1,"this item was a FAKE!!! It was a rebottled , not sealed, in re-used containers!!!!","DO NOT Buy...this item was a fake!!! I go to Kerastase salons often, and this item did not peform. it was re-bottled something, I don't know what!!! The bottles were not sealed. The person sending this out is NOT using the real product!!! Warning Fake product!!!!!"
1,Fake Product!,"I received 4 vials on January 3rd, 2011. This is NOT the product used on my hair at the salon! It is fake!!! Some cheap copy! It was not sealed or had a package. I intend to report these people to Better Business Bureau, as they are stealing money from trusting customers. This makes me angry!"
3,Very nice but not a miracle,I somehow expected for a little more from KerastasseThe product did good to my tortured hair but nothing outstanding
3,Great performances. Recording flawed.,"[...]I have to turn up the volume so high to hear the soft passages, then turn it down again when the music gets louder. It really spoils the enjoyment. Even at very high settings, the subtle details are practically inaudible.Too bad, since I like Maazel's and Isserlis's interpretations very much.It might just be my equipment, though it is very competent. So I recommend buying this CD, but keep your receipt."
3,Too Much Politics Against Early Utah Leaders,"This DVD could have been much better if it hadn't focused so negatively on the politics of early Utah leaders such as Brigham Young. I bought it because I wanted to learn about the transcontinental railroad, not to be harangued about someone's anti-Mormon views."
5,Cute story!,My husband is a police officer so my daughters LOVE this book! It's a very cute story! Shipped quickly and was in perfect condition.
3,Disappointing,"We checked this out from the library and were disappointed.We own 4 of the Big Books by Richard Scary. My son is 3 yrs old and can look/read them for 20-40 minutes a piece. A few pages are worn out from constant looking, pointing, and drooling when he was teething.For boys, I highly recommend ""Cars and Trucks and Things That Go"".This title was read once and forgotten. Glad it was borrowed instead of purchased."
4,Surprisingly refreshing,"I bought this book in a jumble sale and didn't expect it to be so entertaining and surprisingly refreshing! The female characters of the book are so different yet similar in many ways. They were all striving towards freedom of self expression and in the end they find it by completely different means. The addition of the male characters to the story line brought a nice but secondary spice to the book. This book just comes to confirm my belief that the truth is out there, sometimes we are just blinded by love, work or society norms and values that we can't just see it..some of us are lucky enough to realise it sooner than later.Thanks Philippa for the witty humour!"
2,not as good as the daddy version,"sadly, the storyline of this book is not good.because if you already have the ""i love you daddy"" book , that storyline rocks! our baby loves it and wants us to read it over and over again. and so it makes my husband look like a daddy rock-star compared to the ""i love you mommy"" book. i am embarrassed to read this one because the storyline makes her an overprotective, whiny, fun spoiling mother. the only good this book is for---- for a daddy to read it and make a mockery of the mommy."
2,Finally Singing Gets some Respect,"A very odd film, and the other reviewers are right that Rodney was too old for the part. However, lovers of opera may actually enjoy this flick for the singing (other than Rodney when he's not using the magic wine) and the respectful treatment of the world's greatest art form.I looks like Rodney or his producers actually knew something about the art of singing and liked it. Rosa, her mother and father and the other 'real singers' all are portrayed to sing beautifully, naturally, and sincerely. There's not a hint of the sarcasm and caricature that the typical Hollywood cultural ignorance could have applied. The movie accepts the thesis that bel canto singing is worthwhile on its own terms, and not just as a celebrity vehicle for the Three Tenors, or an art form to be marginalized by the mainstream of pop culture.Although I'm sure he didn't set out to make a music education film, Bravo Rodney!"
5,"Truly enjoyable, lovely","Similar to ""Christmas in the Clouds,"" truly a simple, enjoyable, special movie. Made us feel good. Typical funny Mr. Dangerfield, truly worth watching. We're going to watch it for the 2nd time this week. Highly recommend this movie."
4,not bad!,"Came across this at the library and checked it out. So glad I did! Surprisingly entertaining. OK, so Rodney at 70 or 80 being romantically involved with not one, but two, 30-something women...yawn! But, otherwise, really not a bad flick. Some laugh-out-loud goofy moments, and original in its own weird way. Watch it if you get the chance."
1,TIme and Money Lost,"This movie was proabably one of the worst films i've ever seen. To the person aka Mike Vegas, have you ever been on a trip to Italy? This movie was filmed entirely in California. WAKE UP!!!!This movie ranks along side the classic Stallone flick......Rhinestone."
1,not new,"bought as birthday gift and when opened at party the skirt pieces falling off; velcro connections on skirt not there; obviously not new (used, used, used); would not use this seller again!"
5,Lord Brocktree,"This is the thirteenth book in the redwall series. It is another great book in the redwall series. The story focuses on Lord Brocktree, a badger lord, who is on his journey to rule the mountain stronghold of Salamandastron. Along his way he mets Dotti the young haremaid and Ruff the otter. He also mets several other creatures whom he has adventures with. Meanwhile, at Salamandastron, Lord Stonepaw,Lord Brocktree's father, has to defend the mountain from the evil wildcat named Ungatt Trunn and his evil Blue Hordes. He is a ruthless killer who wants to conquer Salamandastron for himself and his hordes. The last battle in this book is absolutely spectacular. This is easily one of my favorite redwall books. All of the books that are in the redwall series are great. Brian Jacques is one of the best storytellers and this book shows his skill. I recommend this book to anyone ,if your a redwall fan or not, and this is a must have book that everyone should own."
4,Lord Brocktree,"This book is a must for Brian Jacques fans. It combined everything that is Jacques style: riddles, a quest, adventure, and battle. But I agree with the first reviewer, I think that the end of the book was very bad, and there were some other places where there could have been more added. Brian rushed the end battle, usually there is vibrant descriptions of swordplay, such as in the end battle of Mattimeo, and Martin the Warrior. These were the only bad things, and overall Lord Brocktree was a good book."
1,Lord Brocktree by Brian Jaques,"I was supposed to get this title instead I got book one in the Redwall series. I gave it to another child to read, but I was very dissapointed in the vendor and the emploee who picked the wrong book. Will not use them again. And now I have to order again to complete the group of books Alex likes."
2,Maybe 2 1/2...,"Lord Brocktree, to say the least, was a boring book. It was almost as boring as Legend of Luke. It could be because of the pages and pages of pointless dialogue, or maybe the same repeated plot that Jacques keeps using. Either way, this book was anything but put-down-able. I give this 2 stars only because I have a soft spot for Brian Jacques and there were a FEW interesting parts. But, if you want Classic Jacques, the true quality of his best books, read Redwall and some of the other earlier ones before you read Brocktree.In other words, Brian Jacques, what's with you lately?? Come up with a new plot!! And maybe the bad guys could win for once."
4,Lord Brocktree exciting and interesting.,Lord Brocktree By:Brian Jacques A very exicting book for people with big imagination. For people with high reading levels like 5th and higher. I really suggest this book.
3,Same Old Story,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Redwall series, but the author, Jacques is rewritting the same old story again and again. This one was almost worst than Legend of Luke. He is also going back to the old stories and legends. Why can't he come up with ENTIRELY new characters? I still give it three stars, though because even though it's the same old story over and over again it is still pretty good but getting a tad bit old."
5,Lord Brocktree by S.E.C.,"Lord Brocktree, by Brian Jacques is about a mountain fortress called Salamandastron that is under attack. A lone badger named Lord Brocktree and his friend, the Skipper of Otters try to take it back. The rest is in the book. I would recommend this book for all Jacques fans and fantasy-lovers. This story is a must have for 10 and up."
4,"A Great book, yet not Jacques' Best Offering","Well, i just finished reading Lord Brocktree, the 13th installment in the thrilling Redwall Series. In my opinion, this book is an outstanding piece to be added to anyone's collection of books. Although i enjoyed this novel, I couldn't help but feel like Jacques' rushed through some parts of the novel that he could've elaborated on. In his past novels, he focused on battles, and wonderful descriptions of swordplay, that would thrill even the blandest of readers, yet in this one, i feel that he went through them with too much speed, like he was almost behind on his deadline when writing it. That's my only complaint though, other than that minor flaw, it is a great novel, and everyone should read it. Also read ""The Long Patrol"", because it is the best novel in the Redwall Series to date."
5,lord brocktree,"This book is a thriller.Its full of fun, excitement ,and adventure.I personally got sucked into the the book and pictured the evennts that were happening in the book.I would strongly recomand a teen to read lord brocktree."
5,It is a great book.,Lord Brocktree is a fun book to read and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part of the book was the battle that took place at the end of the book.
4,Viva! Ann-Margret!!,"The songs on the CD highlight the unique bubbly and talented voice of Miss Ann-Margret. Except for a few slow songs on the CD, Ann-Margret proves to be the one and only female Elvis! These are songs you can sing along to and will play over and over again."
5,Excellent results,I have used Mirka coarse through very fine six inch PSA disks. All have performed flawlessly and produced outstanding results.
5,Product was worth purchasing.,"Having 8.5 years in body work in my past, I've run across some inferior products. This is NOT one of them. The backing kept it's tackiness, and the front grit performed it's job w\o flaw. I used this in working on my Corvette, and was very pleased with it's performance."
5,Abrasive Happyness,"You just can't go wrong with Mirka abrasives, so much better than the no-name cheapo stuff that may be less expensive due to cheap materials being used but they don't last or work as well as Mirka. I'll find somewhere else to skimp, I love quality abrasives too much to be stingy here."
3,Fantastic detailed presentation but unflowing,"I have read a decent amount of literature related to the Holocaust. Each book has been difficult, in its own right, to finish. However, an observation I realized with this particular book was that it is, in one word, choppy. The book was written by three different survivors of the Holocaust. Each of their stories well deserves to be read. However, the way it was formulated into this book makes it not flow. Each chapter has a different style of writing to it, since it was written by one of the three authors. Hence, that aspect made this book more difficult to get through. Once I got used to one man's style of writing, the next chapter was someone else's. I am not saying this is a bad book. On the contrare: what was written deserves to be read. However, this is not one book that you can just easily read to pass time. It needs to be sat down with and read carefully."
2,Not an uplifting read,"This book voices a strong opinion that I disagree with completely. It seems to exclaim that good cannot survive where evil is so overwhelming. There were, according to these survivors, no heroes at Auschwitz; those who did not die became ""totally familiar with the inexplicable and the abnormal"" and ""learned to live on intimate terms with the crematoria."" This book is not for those who choose to see survival in Auschwitz as a triumph of the human spirit. Anyone who claims that there were no heros of this tragedy has not read ""Facing the Lion: Memoirs of a Young Girl in Nazi Germany"", in my opinion a much better written book and FAR more uplifting."
4,and it's dishwasher safe???,"I collect wine glasses & goblets so I'm especially proud to give this item such a high rate. It's simple yet elegant which makes it great for every day uses or special occasions. And above all-it's dishwasher safe, so you dont have to soak them overnight or worry about trying to fit your knuckles inside the glass to wash it by hand. And Amazon.com offers them at such a great price. How can you go wrong?"
5,What Else Is There?,"You wander away from 'Double Jeopardy' wondering how &where the $2 mil policy was paid out, and from 'Hannibal' wonderinghow soon Lecter got Clarice sauteed and garnished up real delectable, and then you come across something like this, that's tight as a drum all the way through.There won't likely be a sequel. What could be clever enough to follow this aerial bouquet of murder weapons? END"
4,A Negligible Coincidence? I don't think so...,"I read this a few weeks or months ago and I have to agree the men cry too much but the modus operandus of Virgil did stick in my mind... but what if there was a thousand helium balloons somewhere ... well, fifty ... that suddenly weren't there any more and somebody mysteriously died at the same time ... wouldn't it logically proceed that, all things considered, those occurring simultaneously would raise some speculation ... ?"
5,Guns and Hankies,"That ""Drug Ministry"" is really something. Once the underground city is entered this dreamlike bubble transports us inside an enormity reminiscent of the first ""King Kong.""The characterizations are exquisite. The beauteous earth mother Ximena Del Rio makes a radiant heroine. It's a shame she comes on only after we get through the first hundred twenty some pages. A major weakness in the story. She gives it its greatest warmth. She is the strongest character.Virgil's crime scenario is intriguing. Hard to believe we could come up with a new way to kill somebody but this might be it.The men seem to cry a lot when they're not out on sorties destroying life and property. It's comforting to contemplate even terrorists have a tender side."
5,Some Gimmick !,"This is a pretty cool scheme all right !Guys, make sure we not tempted to test this system out on the ol' lady ... !Or gals, vice versa ... ? !Ooops !"
5,A view from Losers Anonymous,"A Cat's Full Nine is about places real and on the edge of unreal, about souls in suspension, lost souls refound. About the invincibility of fate, and the great extent to which we do make our own fate. It is about recognizing ourselves in somebody else and finding our solutions in the examples of theirs - or reconciling at last to what we are.. I never felt as close to a fictional character as I did to Virgil, just a would-be harmless guy who would readily do the right thing if it hadn't turned out to be so damned inconvenient. A shame, but not an undervalued stock in decisionmaking. Alas, as to what he has become, how many of us have to say ""there but for the grace?"""
5,Sing with The Ron Winans Family And Friends Choir II,"This album is wonderful. Every song on it is great. It may be the best of the Ron Winans Family & Friends Series. The album features Ron, Marvin, Michael and Deborah Winans, Vickie Winans, BeBe & CeCe Winans and Twinkie Clark. It is well-worth buying."
1,Not helpful,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is completely general, full of platitudes and obvious ideas. There was nothing in the book I hadn't already read on pregnancy web sites. It also expresses biased and one-sided social views. If your viewpoint is the same as the author's, great. But if you are just looking for all of the information available, this book is completely unhelpful.Poor quality production - looks like it was photocopied and slapped together. MUCH more helpful, full of facts and information :Pregnancy and Parenting after Thirty-Five: Mid Life, New Life (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book)."
3,"Worth getting, but you will find Cause and Effect or Intuition in your stereo more often","I'd actually give this 3.5 stars, but..........can't.I have had this album for over 6 years. If you appreciate the type of deep driving bass frequencies, rich resonant male vocals, and true synthpop, you will probably like this album.After a time though, you will find that this is not being played as frequently as Cause and Effect, Intuition, or Iris.This IS a good album, but is suited better towards excercise or driving in your car than it is for playing at home after a time. The beats along with the heavy synth bass lines are motivating, but the lyrics aren't quite as poetic/meaningful/soulful as Cause and Effect or Iris.Unfortunately, as with most all 30 second sample excerpts, the listening previews allowed by Amazon or other sites won't do this album justice."
4,Depeche Mode clone -- consistently good,"This first album by Seven Red Seven places them strongly in the category of American clones of Depeche Mode's synthpop sound. If you like the first albums by Cause & Effect (""Another Minute"" or the self-titled album), Red Flag's ""Naive Art"", or Anything Box's ""Peace"", you will love this album.In terms of sound, Seven Red Seven here is closest perhaps to early Cause & Effect, particularly in vocals. Like all the groups mentioned, the vocalist strives to emulate the British-inflected, deep, resonant style of vocal delivery associated with Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan."
3,good glasses,Really liked these glasses. Had some similar from Pier One a few years back but they broke. Bought these as a replacement to go with my blue dishes
5,Simply Beautiful,I bought two sets of these glasses about two years ago. They are beautiful! I bought two sets anticipating that some would be broken in the dishwasher or by children. They have been very durable. Only two have been broken...one by a friend and one by the dishwasher. I think that is pretty good odds for two years. We use them everyday and wash them about every other day. They are a great buy for the money.
2,"Nice to look at, but not durable!","I bought these about 4 months ago, because they got good reviews, and I really liked the color. However, they have not held up at all. The first two that broke, I convinced myself that we were too rough with them. One by one they went though. We bought two sets, and have 5 glasses left. Is it possible to get a bad batch of glass? I would give them 5 stars if I bought them as disposable glasses.If you own these, hold them up to the light, and you might discover cracks in yours too. They are not always easy to spot. And, sure they stack, but good luck getting them apart.Glad I got them at a good price, or I would be disgruntled, rather than annoyed."
4,"Libbey Cobalt Blue Glasses - Beautiful, but Pricey","I had cobalt blue glasses in mind for my next set... Libbey is an excellent brand that I've trusted for a long time. Well, the glasses are terrific! They are durable glass, yet beautiful, not barware. The blue is exquisite and does not scratch. They are truly blue glass..."
2,"Wow, I ordered a box of glass shards!","Don't expect these to be packaged very well. The box of glasses was placed in a slightly larger box and some bubble wrap was shoved beside the box on one side to keep it from shifting. It seems they have never shipped anything with the United States Postal Service before...Anyways, due to poor packaging, and the usual from the post office, I am the proud owner of some very pretty broken glass. I'll give two stars because the pieces were a lovely shade of blue.The item says it's from Target, so I'm going to see about ordering this at a Target so I can just pick it up at the store."
5,Really nice!,"These glasses are beautiful, and being stackable take up way less space in my tiny little cupboards! They are a bit tough to fit into the dishwasher because of the flared shape, but this is a minor complaint."
3,Cute and delicate,"These glasses are pretty and comfortable, a good size and feel. However, they WILL NOT SURVIVE a fall from the table or counter onto the floor. Infact, they will transform into this beautiful blue mist that covers your floor in a glass-shard carpet. If one of these beauties breaks at your house, be sure to have a broom, swiffer, and dustbuster nearby."
4,Libbey Cobalt glasses,"I am a ""blue"" person. I love the color blue. I used to be able to find these cobalt glasses in most department or dicount stores but not anymore. If you are a ""blue"" person, this is the only place you can find them."
2,These are kind of cheesy,I bought these because they look beautiful in the picture. I returned them because the glass was thick and not that evenly molded. They just had a cheap feel to them and my wife hated them too.
5,Passed a 4 year road test!,"I love the color, my family love the size (hold more cola)! We only use them for cold drinks but after nearly 4 years they're all in perfect shape. Personally I wish they were available in 13oz & had a sister set in green. Come on Libby! Please?!PS, I give 4 stars when I get what I pay for. Five is when I've gotten more!"
2,Glasses,"Nice color, but did not hold up to shipping at all. Of the 16 glasses 11 had broken in shipping!"
2,Beautiful but easily broken,"I, like the person above, really loved these glasses, such a beautiful blue color. However, one by one, they very easily broke and cracked. I would not spend the money on them, but find ones that are thicker and more durable."
5,Give it a try!,"In my search for a topical pain reliever, I've found that most of the typical drugstore items either smell, burn, are messy, and just plain don't work! I happened upon this item in an organic food store, read the package carefully, and gave it a try. True to the insert, noticeable pain relief takes about a week, but it is definitely NOTICEABLE! My arthritic knee, combined with Synvisc injections twice a year, is now functioning - not back to where it was when I was 50, but using Triflora as an adjunct to the injections and a once-a-day anti-inflammatory is a far cry from taking medicine 3-4 times a day and walking with a cane.Miracle drug? No. It probably will not work for everyone. But in my case, when used in combination with my regular medical care, I've managed to avoid knee replacement surgery for easily another year!!!!It's worth a try, and I'm glad I gave it a chance."
5,A SCI-FI WHOOPEE PILLOW,"Of course, The Rift is not at all profound. Or anything near sophisticated. Some may see this series as trash; well; it is trashy, but it's funny trashy. And unique and surprising. Even the CGI effects are surprisingly well-done. Just enjoy. Like. very well-designed, well-executed trash.(Oh, this review relates to The Rift's Second Season. There's a movie, too, and a few more seasons.I doubt there's every been a show like this on cable/satellite. Certainly not on broadcast TV. Are youan adolescent or a grown-up terminal adolescent? This funny, surprising well-done Sci-Fi spoof is for you.) If you've got a trashy sense of humor you'll give it five stars too."
4,tripping the rift,very pleased - meet all expectations - didn't realise it's censored - I believe the rating would have to change for public sale?
4,All We Need Is Another Chance,This CD is excellent for anyone that has an ear for nostalgic R&B from the '70s. It shows what can be accomplished even though mistakes have been made. Everyone has the ability to be a productive part of this world and this CD is an example of that.
5,It really works!,"I read this book, tried it on my hard-headed 16 year old son, and wow, was I pleasantly surprised at the results. To this day my son remembers some of those stories I told him. Then I used it on my teenage daughter, with similar results. Now I am buying it for a friend who is going through what I went through. This book helped turn Mom the Enforcer into Mom the Communicator. Thank you John Alston!"
4,"great product, low price",It works great. The cost was a lot better than getting from the store. Thanks
4,Good product!,Battery didn't fit exactly as I would have liked but well enough to hold a charge. Shipped very quickly. Car charger works great.
1,Melted,"Plugged it in (in the USA) and 10 minutes later it was melting. I opened it up and the freaking transistor is resting on the plastic casing, the source of the melt. This is just poor craftsmanship and I'm sure the majority of these work great, but beware."
1,Battery Charger,"OMG!!! This is absolutely worthless!!! The only thing I know was that I heard an EXPLOSION and when I checked, both the charger and the battery had exploded!!!"
4,"Cheap price, Works.","I received the product quickly, packed well.The quality of the charger is OK, but not really HIGH quality, but I knew that before I ordered it.It charged up the battery I installed in it. I have only charged the battery once, but I feel safe in assuming it will perform properly for an acceptable lifetime.The price was very good; however, I do not care for the practice of displaying a super-low price, and charging an extra-high price for the shipping. Even though the total cost was acceptable, I regard it as a slippery, deceptive practice."
1,Difficult to use,"My grandson has a similar one that works great. This one won't work with rechargeable batteries and runs too fast to blow bubbles with a fresh battery. Overall, an annoying toy to use with a two year old."
4,Old School HIDDEN Gem,"""Somebody's Gotta Win (Somebody's Gotta Lose)"" ALONE makes this CD, for it's an impossible hit to find and ITs the Album (Slo Draggin in the CLUBs) Version. The baseline has been used a couple of times in the New Jack Eras.The CD also includes ""Heaven Is Only One Step Away"" and the brotha singing (make that ""Sangin"") Lead has an Ole School Beggin quality that Keith Sweat can only dream of and it's also the Album Version.The other songs are OK but the above 2, 12+ minutes? Slammin like a WWF Wrassler on Steroid."
1,less than 0star.,Amazon said they were going to correct this totally wrong description!But they didn't yet?I got an sincere apology and proper action from Macy'sbut not from Amazon.I even didn't get a refundof shipping yet but I'm too tired to waste my time again.Dealing two companies is too hard.
1,Gamefest: Classic Rednecks,"What I ordered was supposed to be for Windows 95/98 & Windows ME, but what I was sent is only compatible with Windows 95/98 & DOS, so there is some false advertising going on here...therefore, I cannot accurately rate the game since I cannot get it to play in my system.This is bad business!"
3,Lots of entertainment for a small child,This DVD was wonderful for my little sister who is 2! She thouroughly enjoyed every second of it and it kept her very occupied!
2,Very Disappointing,"My daughter loves the Young Children's Concert with Raffi. We purchased the Rise and Shine Band video in the hopes that she would enjoy it as well. The accompanying Rise in Shine Band is horrible. It sounds more like a Hee-Haw video than a children's video. Raffi did not engage the audience well in this video. In fact, some footage shows children in the audience asleep because it is a painfully dull performance. He does not invite the children to sing sing along with him. It is just NOT FUN! It is painful o watch."
5,Save time and buy two!,"I've played this video so often since my daughter was a year old, that I wore out the original. She'll be three soon and still loves the songs and the dancing. It's a simple video mostly with just Raffi, his guitar and the kids in the audience, but that's all your little one (and you) really need. Enjoy!"
5,Raffi in Concert,FOr years Raffi never fails to know how to entertain both young children and their parents. This DVD includes all his best hits well performed.
2,Cheap compilation cashing in on the success of one song,"This is one of those 'greatist hits' by musicians considered to be one hit wonders, that one hit of course being the almighty 'Whip It', which is probably one of the most, if not THE most, notorious alternative hits from the 80's. The rest of the comp, while consisting of some great material, is a short affair of tracks seemingly tacked on without care after 'Whip It', but that's pretty obvious since the song's title is used in the title of the compilation, which is a pretty tacky ploy in itself.Basically, if you like the song Whip It and might consider getting into this truly awesome band, try going for their 'Greatist Hits' instead as a warm-up, which'll give you a much clearer view of the band's overall psyche and style, because if you do find you enjoy these 10 tracks you'll kick yourself for getting such a whimpy compilation."
4,"Good audio book, seller sent me a used copy though.","I really like the concepts in this book. It makes a lot of sense and can be put into practice right away. What I like about it is it helps put the information from other books into real use and helps you to set realistic expectations and goals on a micro level. I recommend it to everyone.The copy I received was used. The CDs were in good shape but the case was not. No big deal, but I do not appreciate paying full price for used items."
5,Game Changer,"The principle of a change in philosophy really works. Applying the slight edge ""Simple acts of daily discipline compounded over time, lead to greatness"" really works. And it is so easy to do... as it is not to do... but for once I think I have at least half a chance of being successful!!!!"
5,A big Edge with the Slight Edge,The Slight Edge is the best personal development document I have ever read the simplicity of the message brings everything into focus. In the very first chapter you begin to understand why you are where you are; it's a no brainer. Get your whole family to read this book.
5,Excellent,I really loved this book. It would be a perfect gift for every student. I think every single high school student should have to read this book.
5,Wish I had read this 20 years ago,One of the best business books I have ever read. Give a copy to a young person you know. I wish I had read this in my 20's not my 40's. I will be buying more to give to people I really care about.
3,Slight Edge Audiobook,"Slight Edge audio content was excellent, but it's abridged and not read by the author Jeff Olson. It's also not the audio of Slight Edge revised edition. Content was very good, but it's needs updating and unabridged."
5,Life Changing Book,This book has completely change my view of life! It is all within my means and ability to change the path I am on. It only takes making some everyday decisions over and over.
4,Amazing!,"If you want to learn how to move to the next level in your life or get that jumpstart and push again, get this product. All you have to do is pop it in your CD player in the car and listen to it on a regular basis, it will bless you and make all the difference in the world to your life. Its the little steps to big success that lasts a lifetime."
1,stanley hot glue gun,"I bought two of these glue guns, and on both of them the trigger failed within aprox. 8 hours of use. Once the trigger fails, the glue gun will not heat up. They are junk and you would be wasting your money if you bought one."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,"This heavy hot-melt glue-gun user was thrilled when she opened her new Stanley GR-100 christmas gift anticipating it would vastly improve her speed and gluing finesse; alas, the trigger on it is a great deal tougher to pull than my .38 (no mean feat - perhaps manufacturer wants you to carefully reflect upon the consequences of wanton gluing . . . )!!!! rendering it impossible for me to use at all! Gifter purchased it from off-beaten-track store and we never had time to exchange or get $$$ back for - save yourself a lousy experience and buy something else from someone easy to return to (as is in my experience Amazon[.com])."
1,STANLEY GR100 GLUE-PRO DUALMELT GLUE GUN,"I BOUGHT THIS GLUE GUN 3 WEEKS AGO.DID NOT HAVE MUCH LUCK WITH IT.IT DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH TO MELT THE GLUE TO COME OUT OF NOZZLE.TRIED DIFFERENT TYPES OF GLUE STICKS & SWITCH THE HEAT SETTINGS,STILL NO LUCK.BOUGHT A CHEAP GLUE GUN THROUGH TMART AND IT WORKS GREAT AT LESS THEN HALF THE PRICE OF THIS ONE.RATING 0 OUT 5 STARS.DON'T BUY AND KEEP YOUR MONEY."
3,Not as good as nails.,"While I do recommend this gun if you're serious about being provided with a yellow multi-tiered and scaleable way of sticking things together (and note, this does have 2 nozzles -- great idea!) I have to still reccommend nails even more highly when you're dealing with wood."
1,Total Disappointment,This book had a missing/torn piece on pretty much every page! Don't know what to do with it at this point. The $4.00 I paid for it is not worth my time and effort to return it. I will never order from this seller again... :o(
3,A basic French workbook.,"As far as workbooks go, this one is average. The activities are strongly tied to the book and only serve to reinforce activities from the textbook. It also does not add any better material than that already in the textbook. If it is not required by the class then I would not recommend it, time and money are better spent elsewhere."
3,DVD/Web Access?,"I am using this book as an independent. However, in order to use the website that accompanies some activities in the book, a course number needs to be entered. Without that course number, a DVD should be used instead. However, that DVD did not come with book. So it is impossible to do the video activities included in the book.It is a good book otherwise, as I used it to teach at the university in Florida. Customer service was great and I was offered the option of contacting them with any problem, which I did not do. They might have sent the DVD. I hope they do include it in any future order.Thank you."
2,"Works, but not worth the savings","Update: Covers popped off the sides of the handle assembly (snapped back on) on both clamps. The steel plate which grabs the shaft has bent on one of the clamps, significantly reducing the travel per squeeze. With pads glued to the clamps, these are OK for light use.It works and is reversible, but:- the grey rubber pads are pretty stiff and are always sliding/falling off- the release button is on the back of the handle, making it hard to avoid pressing it and the main lever simultaneously (in which case it doesn't work)- one of my clamps lost its screw which attaches the reversible arm and when I tried to reattach it I found that its too small for the nut its paired with (neither are stripped, but the screw just slides in and out of the nut without grabbing)I don't know how much I saved by going with these over the ""name-brand"" but it was not worth it."
3,"looks great, if you can actually put it together","Once put together, this bed looks great. It was a lot less expensive (I paid <$300 on sale) than similarly looking products by brand name manufacturers. The problem - fit and finish. It was extremely difficult to put it together. Parts simply do not fit. I had to try and try again just to put screws through, and make them go in right holes, and slowly tighten them little by little. Exchangeable drawer fronts are a great idea, but some drawers are not working right due to the same problem - bad fitting. After some modifications, I got them all to close, and slide reasonably well. Overall, I'm glad I bought two of these beds, saving a bunch of money, but I would not like to go through the experience of putting these bed together again."
2,Received the wrong charger,"Received the wrong home charger, car charger on the first order, did not wnat to go through the process of returning the wrong product. So I reorder the charger again, this time I have the correct one."
1,Aces of the Deep,"I ordered this game because i had played the earlier game with the DOS format. This was supposed to run on windows, but it didn't. I sent and received multiple emails to the manufacturer, but never could get it to run on my computer. I have a modern HP Pavilion computer that runs anything else I want it to, but not this game. They said it must be my sound card???And, of course, they wouldn't refund my money. I purchased this game through Amazon.com. I'm out about $50.00 or so. Live and learn.450.00 or so. Live and learn. The lowest rating I can give this game is one star, but I actually rate it as a 0."
1,Would not work with Vista,I was looking forward to playing this game. My MS VISTA would not support it. It might be DOS Based only.
1,Cannot send faxes or make copies,This is a cheesy machine. The very first fax we tried to send resulted in black pages sent to our receiver.Making a copy gave us the same results. Stay away from this fax!
5,Easy setup and works great.,Fax machine works great.You don't need a extra line or a other phone number.Machine has a mode that is fax/phone.Only one thing you can not use regular paper.The paper has to be purchase from Brother Company. Two rolls cost about $25.30.With that being said it is still worth it. If you are like me that receive more faxes than sends them it is worth buying.
4,Good fax machine,Works OK. Has limited features. Can't shorten paper length to match amount of faxed data. Features match cost I guess
5,Unbelievable - fantastic music for popular/ethno fans,Christine Anu has broken through typical pop music by integrating an island sound and funky lyrics to a fantastic voice. Production is excellent and her ability to take you to different moods is beyond reproach in her genre. Highly recommended! Christine - we want more!
1,Garbled Groves makes for haphazard reading,"The Kindle version of this venerable dictionary is a mess. It appears that the printed text has been scanned and OCR'd. It has many of the characteristics of a scanned document, including misspellings, missing apostrophes, spaces within words, page headers and footnotes embedded in the main text. Music examples are totally garbled. There is no way to systematically locate entries; predictably, searches on names and musical keywords produce hits throughout the dictionary. It's a pity, because this is a highly respeected reference work.Dictionary of Music and Musicians"
2,Not So Great,"I purchased this software after extensive research and trade reviews. I wanted to use it to design a basement finishing project. Although it draws wall lines ok, it is not very useful for depicting an electrical or plumbing plan. I had hoped to provide a useable plan to my contractor but am disappointed in the result. Also, the 3D view is very limited and almost useless. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Too bad 2 Rate.,It's too bad you don't have a minus scale to rate this product. Punch is the worst fraud in the pack. It is amazing that they are still allowed to sell this useless program. It is cartoonish and a waste of time and money. Broaderbund should be very careful about allowing other companies to use their name on these sorry programs. As a 10 year user of the 3DHA 4 program it is sad to see the name misrepresented.
1,How do I rate this MINUS 5?,"I've used an older version of this software for years designing kitchens and bathrooms for my customers. New version will not open old files and this is NO improvement over version 1 through 8. All the good old features that were easy to use are gone. I understand Encore might be owned by Microsoft, so you may need to take classes to learn to use the features; no more using intuition to use the software. I downloaded the software for $39.00 from their website, then demanded and got my money back. Bought it from Amazon, wishing it would work better...What a dreamer ;-( Don't buy it at any price. I may try to buy the old software so I can open my saved files."
2,Can't get it right,"I used a version of this product in 2000 that was good enough to create plans my contractor used to do a gut reno. Not so this time. Having tried several of these software packages, I thought I could get to an accurate new floor plan, construct multiple 3D views and manipulate decor with relative ease (e.g., in under 2 hours of trying). Unfortunately, inexplicable and impassable roadblocks kept coming up, making this a poor choice. Too bad, because it seems so easy to make it, well, easier than Autocad."
1,3D Home Architect Home Design Deluxe version 9,No I am unable to register the program due to it being a copy and no registration instructions were included. Therefore I could only use it free for 7 days. Did not do me any good.
3,Closet organizer,Great idea but very cheap material. It is a shame!!!!!!The material cames damaged but I installed it. Takes time and it is not easy for one person alone
3,Really just ok,Parts 3 and 5 were the best of all 5. The other sections were pretty ho hum. It seemed hokey and jumped around quite a bit in the beginning. Probably my least favorite episode so far.
2,iTouchless Bug Zapper,"I had this bug zapper for about two years. The activation button was very finicky and would not work very easily. I had to make adjustments to the power pack to get it to work. The on button fell apart a couple of times and I was able to put it back together. When the on button broke again, I just threw the whole thing away. This product is effective at killing bugs when it actually turns on. This bug zapper was more trouble than it was worth. I should have returned it immediately."
4,Electric fly sizzler,"This rechargeable electric fly swatter works well only when you can get a stupid fly to actually land on it by accident. Slowly swishing it through the air like a tennis racket doesn't work well cuz the flies sense the air movement and zip away. This would work well if the Asian manufacturer added some sort of fly pheromone on it to attract the flies to it instead of nearby food. A manual fly swatter is much more effective. But when this electronic swatter actually gets its chance to zap an aforementioned stupid bug, it works spectacularly well! BTW, the photo of this product shows a yellow swatter; mine is actually green and has a smallish head."
1,"Broke after minimum usage, NO WARRANTY!","Product started off good, but after less than 2 months of light usage it went kaput. After getting in contact with iTouchless, they informed me that there was NO warranty on item with only offering 15% off me purchasing another one with them. Blah. Crap product given its faulty performance and waste of money."
4,Love it!,This thing is rad! The flies don't stand a chance! Fruit flies do stand a chance though. They are small enough to get through the holes without being zapped. But oh well. Can't win 'em all right? At least the most annoying flies will be zapped and that is pretty satisfying after they have been landing on your face! Happy zapping!
4,Don't Bug Me,"This is like a Badminton racket with a charge. I really like that it uses a built in rechargeable battery. It does a great job of zapping unwanted pests in the house, porch, and patio.It doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as I think it should. Seems to lose battery power when NOT in use. After a good charge it works great!"
1,Charged once and then dead,"I got this little gem for Christmas '07 and didn't get a chance to try it out until just recently. Right out of the box, I charged it up and it seemed to charge. Unplugged it and drawered it for several months. The charge was gone and the charge light no-longer came-on when I plugged it in. What a disappointment. I went with this one instead and am very pleased:Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug ZapperFly zapping should be a sport!"
1,iTouchless Rechargebale Portable Handheld Electric Bug Swapper,"I only used this three times. It was great at first, but after charging it for the third time---it does not work!!! The light will flicker, but then it suddenly turns off. After a few attempt to push the button, the light does not come come on at all. This is a cheaply built bug swatter and I would NOT recommend it to anyone."
3,"works, but cheaply made","as soon as i took out the rechargeable battery, the little plastic piece that holds it in broke. but, i charged it anyway and it works fine so far. it zaps mosquitoes with a snap crackle pop!"
2,Worked well till recharging battery shorted out,"It kills bugs excellently, unfortunately when I attempted to charge the battery for the first time, it shorted out and sparked and now the swatter will not work. I gave it 2 stars and not one since it did last a month and brought at least 100 mosquitoes, flies, and bees to their grave!"
1,"Gone Bad in 31 Days, iTouchless has 30 day warranty",I charged this product once and it worked well. The charge almost lasted 1 month. Tried charging again and it doesn't charge. Called iTouchless and they told me that this product has 30 DAY WARRANTY and there is nothing they can do.
3,Find one that takes C or D batteries!,"These are nice, they make mosquitos POP when you zap them.However, if you're one of those who likes to have fun when you kill bugs, get one with either C or D batteries. They carry MUCH more power and will kill things like Cockroaches which AA battery-powered swatters will not."
1,Fly Zapper,"The rechargeable battery attracted me to purchase this item because one of my neighbors have a similar one. This one has many safety feature which prevent you from killing the bug so it's not as efficient. Just get the plain zapper, it shocks'em faster!"
4,Single handedly reducing the fly population!,"Works very well, and it is rechargeable! I charged it one time and it has been going strong since (about a month)."
1,Never got it! wish I could tell you!,I never received my Electric Bug Zapper - so I'm stil waiting to be able to review it. Thanks for asking.
4,The Very Thought of You,"Funny romantic comedy! If you enjoy Julia Roberts, you will enjoy this movie that is both lighthearted and fast-paced. The plot opens with a american girl(Potter), who on a whim to escape her current life, buys the first plane ticket anywhere for ninety nine dollars, and ends up in London where she meets brits Frank, Daniel, and Lawrence. It is a treat to see Joseph Fiennes in a contemporary film, (much different from the other roles we've seen him in so far) It will be interesting to see his upcoming work in Forever Mine and Enemy at the Gates."
3,Pleasant British Film,Cute British film that works due to capable and likable cast - Monica - Joe - Tom & Rufus. Some nice shots of London and OK musical score except one ugly number that appears to be theme - played a bit too much. Excellent DVD quality - pic & sound.
3,Delightful but don't expect deep,"At first I thought this film was going to be a typical British film with the typical uptight performances, but Monica Potter allowed a better blend to take place and it turned out to be a pretty much delightful movie. I liked the technique of telling the story in the past and then filling in from the present point of view. There's not a lot of depth here, either in script or acting, but it was a charming little romance. I would say if you're a Joseph Fiennes fan you'll really love it. One thing that was kind of difficult to get past was Monica Potter's resemblence to Julia Roberts. At times it felt like the producers wanted Julia but couldn't get her so we got Monica. Overall though a charming, light romance."
3,The Man is Handsome,"This is a cute date flick, pop the wine cork, and throw the popcorn in the microwave. Sure, the coincidence of three best London male friends falling for one Minneapolis blonde-haired woman in a few days is unlikely in real life, but film is not real life. If it were, we would be watching non-stop documentaries or less contrived reality TV.So I'll go along with the quirky, desperate attempt by little Miss Nobody, Monica Potter, Marsha from Minneapolis (a Mary Tyler Moore with a bad attitude) attempt to fly anywhere; just get me out of town and on to my new life where little people are appreciated. Then she meets in succession: the wealthy short person in the music business, his friend, the failed child actor, and Joseph Fiennes, a bridge teacher. I think they could have come up with a more believable occupation for cynical Shakespeare in Love, but the man is handsome and your date will warm up for later activities."
3,A Little Weird,This movie was ok. It was very strange though. I don't think i would recommend it. Joseph Finnes is of course wonderful. But MOnica POtter is wonderful too but is unable to play a wild girl (flashy clothes) it just isn't her. Acting wasn't bad.
3,Fun and unexpected,"Nice, breezy movie. Real chick flick. Even tho' a guy wrote it.Good job!Nice views of London, Love it!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading other's reviews, I thought this was a good selection for me. However, it is one of the worst movies I have watched in some time. It is pointless, and there is nothing funny or charming about it. Just totally boring. I felt like the actors were even ashamed to be in it. Don't waste your time or money if you like some semblence of a plot, good acting, and comedy. It has none of the above."
5,Very Thought of You charms the very heart,"I finally rented ""The Very Thought of You"" on a whim with some friends, after tiring of always seeing it on the ""New Release"" shelf and not knowing what it was about. What we eneded up watching was an endearing romantic comedy with great repartee and interesting plot development. The story of Martha (Monica Potter) and her unplanned trip to London causes her to meet lifelong buddies Daniel (Tom Hollander), Lawrence (Joseph Fiennes) and Frank (Rufus Sewell) who, independently and at different times, met and fell in love with her. The narrative moves backwards and forwards, gradually filling in gaps until we see the story of the three men unfold. Cute, amusing and very watchable movie, this is a great feel good movie to watch any time of the year."
3,A lark but not worth owning,"""The Very Thought of You"" is perhaps typical of the many chick flicks out there. It involves a couple of thoroughly enjoyable devices and concepts, though, that aren't always found in the common movie, such as mistaken identities; story telling through different sets of eyes; unfettered, spontaneous travel and Joseph Fiennes. I bought it on an extremely impulsive whim and regret it. Rent it, don't buy it."
4,the very thought of you,"i really hought this was a good movie;sort of like a british version of PRETTY WOMAN.monica potter reminds me a lot of julia roberts.ther were a couple slow spots,but on the whole a good movie."
3,"Really cute, but not a classic","This may horrify Joeseph Fiennes fans, who seem to be this movie's main audience, but he is not the best thing about it. No, neither is Monica Potter, although she has an easy charm and a truly gorgeous smile. The best thing about the film are the three hilarious supporting performances. Tom Hollander is great as an unlikely rock star and ego-maniac, Ray Winstone charming as the ""psychiatrist"" and Rufus Sewell constantly giggle-inducing as the unemployed and unemployable actor (the best scene has got to be him on the bus shouting ""I love my mother"" and hyper-ventilating about an upcoming audition). Anyhow, despite great work from these three, the movie suffers from being so outrageously implausible. Oh well, it's a romantic comedy, and it is a lot of fun. Just remember: T.H, R.W, and R.S. are the real stars here!"
4,I love this movie,"It's sweet, funny, and thoughful. Girl meets guy, and his 2 (jerky) best friends, each unaware that they've met & fallen for the same girl. She's unaware that she is also lusted after by the two best friends of the guy she's fallen for. Confusion ensues. Guy makes a life-changing choice, despite the fact that he thinks he's lost the girl, and winds up with the girl after all. The two (former) best friends are left behind, not realizing what actually happened.A bit confusing in the way it's told: in flash-backs, but all in all a great story about finding love in the least-expected of places, and not letting one's life stagnate."
2,Iron 10 shirts in 88 minutes,"This movie was recommended to me by my very intelligent sister-in-law. She said it was fun and uplifting but I would have rather been asleep for the 88 minutes than waste my time watching a made for T.V. movie that was shallow, simplistic, weak, and only had Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter going for it. Both are very attractive to look at but Fiennes must have been bored stiff to give this script his time. I agree with other reviewers that Potter looks like a blonde version of Julia Roberts. I'm incredulous that so many reviewers rated this movie so highly. I might have enjoyed it if I was home sick with the flu and half asleep but I expect character development, thought provoking ideas and real poignancy if the movie is romantic. I'm amazed people are so easy to please."
3,Pleasant Fluff,"The 'Very Thought of You' was one of those guilty little pleasures we all take in vegetating on a cold day while successfully procrastinating away from some project. I watched it on my laptop during an open house on a rainy day (very few visitors), and it was the perfect sort of movie for that particular situation. The plot is not complex at all (good for frequent stoppages), though the acting appropriately highlights the best parts of the script. It's an off-beat sort of romantic comedy from a screenwriter who should come out with better things in the future. Monica Potter and Joseph Fiennes give believable performances as hopeless romantics looking for a better life. Friends, foreign travel, and two minor injuries to Fiennes' character mixes up their plans."
5,a quietly surprising film!,"the very thought of you is amazing film because it is funny without all of the big gymics movies use today. the characters are more deep than most movies let writers take them. what is most great about this film is that the actors charm without seeming to try and light of the screen with picture perfect chemistry. Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter act so tenderly and real together that you believe, without a doubt, they are ment for each other. The film is small but don't those always leave you with the best and longest lasting impressions."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I really do love Monica Potter. This movie was a bit disjointed - I wasn't expecting that the story was going to be told in non-chronological order. It's sort of sappy, and I don't really like Potter's character, though Fiennes looks great. I'd recommend watching this if it was free, but I wouldn't pay a lot to see it."
5,"If you care about you're design career, you'll read this.","Mr. Barratt, if he were still alive, should have been knighted forwriting this book. His insight is a spring-board for so many otherthoughts. As the Amazon reviewer said, I also consider this work to besomething like scripture. It doesn't matter if you are amathematician, a musician or a web designer, this book will remind youwhy you got into your field in the first place. It will also lead youto higher ground."
5,Nice!,"Nice hand made hooks at a great price. They are a little smaller than I thought they would be but are working fine as towel hooks. I also bought a TP holder, and two towel racks and they are very nice too!"
4,A very useful practical guide,"this is a fine book in the tradition of ""guides to being on call"" - or maybe the ""guide to the perplexed"". I like the straightforward get to the point style, and the directness of the book makes this a useful book to have handy when confronted with some of the emergency surgery problems. I would only say it could have had a bit more on surgical technique, and one or two references would have been useful (instead there was almost a militant insistence on as few as possible). But I would recommend it for any resident who is on call, and I find it useful as a staff sugeon as well.Chet MorrisonAssistent Professor of SurgeryDirector of Surgical Critical CareMichigan State University"
2,Unsatisfying.,"John Bunting is a mild mannered, straitlaced, somewhat shy engineer. His world suddenly collapses when his fiancee, Ann Jackson, is tragically and senslessly killed in the crossfire of a gangland shootout.John's immediate reaction is to drink himself into oblivion. But then he decides to seek revenge. He vows to identify the hoodlum who fired the fatal shot and then kill him. To do this, John sheds his Milquetoast-like personality and insinuates himself into the very gang responsible for Ann's death.There's a lot wrong with this novel. The plotting is contrived and ham fisted. The motivation behind the actions of the various characters is obscure to the point of inscrutability. And the dialogue, though obviously painstakingly crafted, often lacks authenticity.Journey into Terror is a very unsatisfying novel. Not recommended."
3,Not good as I thought!!!,"I only gave this movie 3 stars because there is a FREAKING COOL 5 minutes motorcycle chase scene of PURE ACTION!!!The chase is about two motorcycle men trying to get a truck. It's FAST, VERY WELL edited and with a BIG EXPLOSIVE moment!! You can also see some few cool stunts and gun shots.BUT THAT'S IT!! The rest of the movie was TERRIBLE!!!! The acting was HORRIBLE!, 90% of the movie was BLAH,BLAH,BLAH!, and the story wasn't THAT interesting.If you like to laught at bad cheesy movies or watch cool motorcycle chases then this one is for you, but if you are looking for a good low budget action-packed film then pass on this one because the motorcycle chase is the ONLY action scene and is set in the half of the movie.Adios."
2,Assuming and presuming...,"The reader from New Haven erroneously assumes that I know nothing of the history of the era depicted in this book. On the contrary, I lived through the smug complacency of the Eisenhower years, and I know Wolff's characters all too well. And my original comments stand. There are no heroes in this tale."
2,A study of privilege and unapologetic arrogance,"There are no sympathetic characters here. A tale of Princeton in the fifties, it is the very mirror of unearned privilege and wealth, and the arrogance that is consequent to it. Wolff's Princetonians really do think they're ""all that"". Get a grip, Geoffrey; after all, it's not Harvard"
2,Disappointing,"I guess I shouldn't really complain because I bought this game used for [dollar smmount]. But even so, I was disappointed. The Mummy game has some interesting puzzles, but you have to put up with a lot of smarmy commentary from Malcom McDowell's character all the while. It really got old. Then I felt like the ending was so cheesy and abrupt that it wasn't worth the trouble of figuring anything out to get there. It was a true let-down. The Frankenstein game is equally frustrating. Lots of wandering around, having no clue what you're doing. Then once you figure out the puzzle, you want to kick yourself for wasting so much time on it. Because it really leads nowhere. Overall, both these games are decent pastimes, as long as you're not expecting high adventure or fast-paced entertainment. Which, sadly, I was."
3,Hey Now....,"I think some of the reviews were too harsh, so I decided I would write one. The game came out in 1997, I remember it being $14.99 when it came out and for 1997, it was pretty good. I play everything from Transport Tycoon (MSDOS) to The Sims, I am playing Frankenstien and I have played the Mummy 3/4 through. I find them both average games, not alot of brains needed. Tim Curry is great as the Dr., that alone is worth the couple of bucks! So for those of you who have been playing these kinds of games since MSDOS or WIN 95, you should enjoy it. As for kids(below 13), Frankenstien does have some things that aren't for them."
3,Buyer Beware,"Buyers should note that in some cases, there is a bug in the Mummy which does not allow you to complete the game. This was disappointing to me because I had enjoyed the game up to that point. Despite this drawback, Frankenstein did work all the way through and was enjoyable though not recommended for younger gamers."
1,Frankenstein,"I purchased the Mummy - Tomb of the Pharaoh, got Frankenstein free. Boy am I glad I didn't have to pay for it. I played and restarted over and over again. I finally reached a point where I just had enough of it. The maze is difficult even with a walkthrough. I finally made it and did everything I was told to do, which supposedly would straighten out the maze for future trips through it, but it never held. Good graphic, just frustrating."
4,Great games!,"The games are really fun! I just wish the dialogue and some of the acting were better. Other than that, the games are great mystery games. Sometimes I get really stuck, so these games aren't just for anyone. These games require critical thinking at times. I recommend these games to anyone who enjoys mystery games."
2,Good as a temporary diversion,"These games are okay if you're really bored, but their really not worth your time. Especially the Mummy game, it's really short and pretty unimaginative. Some aspects of Frankenstein are interesting, but I found it rather hard to get a hang of the game."
1,Oh my god...,"Is this even a game? All you do is control this little hand that's a pointer and click on random objects. It's really stupid. I couldn't even get out of the airplane on the mummy game. Not only that but on my other computer, some how, the mummy game made a directory called c:\mummy files\ and my computer was messed up for a while because of that. Maybe my version had a bug. But after it did that, my CD-ROM wouldn't work right because it couldnt find all it's files. For some reason my computer thought c:\mummy files was c:\program files so alot of my programs wouldn't work. Some are still messed up because when I try to run something, it can't find mummy.exe. So it's not only a really bad game, but the installation software is really messed up. This game wouldn't even be entertaining for 3 year olds. If you want a good family game, try something from Hoyle. Or if you want a good game filled with action, try Tomb Raider. These games are just an insult to video games."
3,family fun,For the money I am happy with both games. My children love to help play the games. These games are easy to maneuver around so it makes them a good price choice for the beginning pc gamer.
2,good deal,"For 10 bucks, I guess it will pass the time. I never got through either one of them. Dark and obscure. I did enjoy and get through Myst, Amber, and Gabriel Knight3. These were just so boring to me I gave up."
3,Begging for more,"This book has one main advantage: you hear excellent, native pronunciation, repeated twice, giving ample time for you to say the word. The book leaves you fairly unsatisfied for adult learners, where there are no sentences or expressions to learn. It might be a nice coloring book for children, though. Despite the fairly obvious picture cues/clues, not all of the words are translated in the glossary, and two much time is given to a dizzying array of kinship terms, the foreign learner hardly needs to worry about."
2,I bought this for the Title Track,"I bought this CD for the Girl-Boy song I heard on the radio. I found that song to be very novel and quite marvelous at the time for its marriage of breakbeat electronica with classical string instrumentation. The production on it is not the best, though. You can't up the bass to listen to the break-beats with any force without having the orchestral bass strings overpoweringly-thumbing out too buzzy-like. Well, this song lost its gloss pretty quickly for me. I think it's an interesting electronic novelty song now. I have since sold this EP to the resale shop. The rest of this CD sounded like an attempt to be a sort of electro version of They Might Be Giants. Mildly amusing at times, for the most part Mr. James didn't seem to hit the mark. I agree, these short tunes with his whimsically innocent vocals DO sound like scraps of sillyness he dug out from bits of crumpled paper perhaps lying around his floor. Probably an EP for fans only, but not essential for me."
2,CLASSIC TIME WASTER,This is an old horror film that someone told me that I had to absolutely watch in order to be an 'authentic horror film critic.' It was awful in my opinion. Hilarious moments but ultimately a time waster.
3,"Needed repair, Not as pcitured","I would rate as 5 stars except for the following:Upon receiving the Accu-Miter and unpacking, I first noticed that the item pictured was not the total item received. As pictured on the Amazon page the Accu-Miter is shown with the Manual Clamp, but not included in the purchase price. I would think an exclusion should be included in the description. I would still purchase the clamp as a necessary addition to the Accu-Miter.Upon assembly and setup of the Accu-Miter I found, like others, that the screws which hold the ""shot pin"" were stripped. After carefully repairing the problem the tool setup perfectly.I would recommend this tool as a necessary addition to any craftsman."
1,JunkDS,Accruate NOT!!! The adjustable stop is nice but try to set an angle. The shot-pin type angle setting has to much slop in it. I still have to make a test cut or three and adjust the angle accordingly...
5,The agony of blind dados: Gone,"If you cut dados on a table saw, you are cutting them blind and know how dificult it is to get the dados to line up on both boards. Fixing this problem is easy with a JDS Accu-Miter.First, all your boards are exactly the same length.Second, the Accu-Miter lets you put the dado in exactly the same position. Finally, the Accu-Miter provides the much needed support along the board while you make the cut."
1,Not at all what is advertised,I just today recieved a new accu miter miter gauge. I was really looking forward to getting a good addition for my table saw. What a huge disappointment. First off there is so much slop in the shot pin setup you have to make several trial cuts and moving one way or the other to remove the slop and get a square cut. ( not a repeatable or positive index lock ) . You can not index the shot pin to 45 and be even close even if you try to move out the slop. My very old craftsman that I wanted to replace is better.It's going back
3,I failed to read the fine print.,"***THEY'VE CHANGED THE PICTURE SINCE.The miter guage pretty much fulfills my expectations after some fine tuning. I must however take issue with this webpage's apparently willful misrepresentation of the product. I neglected to read my fellow consumer's warning and to my dismay I received only part of what pictured above, (no clamp/handle mechanism.) They say it's an accesory, but their available accesories list includes only magic markers. Only after a long and arduous series of phone calls does it appear that customer service is going to make good on their pictoral representation. My advice to them: change the picture."
2,Softwalk Mule Shoe,I was surprised by the tight fit of this shoe since Softwalk is supposed to be a brand of comfortable walking shoes. I appreciated the quick service of the vendor. Desertrose
2,Not practical at all,"The book is shellow. Gives an overview of so many subject that are not related, from device drivers to SQL and HTML, morover, a lot of the subjects that are covered, are no more than their man page or man page equivalent."
1,Is it possible to rate a book a ZERO?,"Please do us all a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.It is riddled with errors, poorly organized, and amateurish. Dear author, there IS a difference between cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, and you sir have it WRONG. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Personally I used Crush Step 3 and was very happy. Others I've known used Kaplan. Most use the USMLEWorld Question Bank.Point being, there are MANY good resources out there, they are all similarly priced, and the others are not FILLED with mistakes and inconsistencies. To even consider this book is doing yourself a disservice.I cannot express how bad this book is. If I met the author I'd definitely give him an earful."
5,Replaces Crush,This book is awesome. I predict that this book will replace Crush and knock down First aid.
2,Workbook,"This was a blank, lined workbook - with little to no instruction or written dialog for teaching. It arrived in great shape, good packaging, shipped well. I would buy from this seller again, but I wonder if the description was thorough enough to let me know what I was buying - as I would not have purchased a blank workbook."
4,Gurilla Glue tuff stuff tuff cleanup,"I used this glue on an ash benchtop I made for my shop. It foams while it cures and I had a bit of clean up the next day. Also wear gloves its ruff on hands, all in all a good strong waterproff glue."
1,Failed for me,"I tried this glue because my titebond had expired and the shop I was in didnt have titebond. I do not work for any glue company - just have used stuff in the past and it worked. The Gorilla Glue failed. I used it to bond small peices of metal like I had with Titebond many times without issue. The Gorilla cured for 48 hours. After which, I took the peices apart with normal movement. They just fell apart. Some people think they know everything and will blame my technique but its real simple. The glue didnt hold.. The remaining Gorilla Glue residue was easy to clean off anyway - it flaked right out of the joint. I redid the joint with epoxy and its fine now.Gorilla is going back to the store for a refund. Gotta let merchants feel the pain of selling crap. To much politics these days with stores only having certain brands.To my knowledge the titebond poly and gorilla glue are the same animal. One works the other doesnt. That aint technique - that's fact."
2,Strange Stuff,"I usually use Titebond, but, because of some rave reviews, I decided to try the Gorilla Glue. I went to it because I heard it gives you more working time. But after glueing up some boards, I gave them a test and found, to my absolute dismay, that I was able to pull the boards apart after the gorilla glue was dried! This is not supposed to happen. The directions tell you to moisten the surface first, which I did, but still, the bond was not strong enough for my taste.Also, the glue is IMPOSSIBLE -- and I repeat -- IMPOSSIBLE to clean off your hands. You MUST wear rubber gloves if you use this stuff. I got some of this glue on my hands when I used it, and it literally took a week of scrubbing every day before it was all off. This would be OK if the glue was really outstanding, but I have my doubts.I have decided to return to Titebond."
1,Sorry Glue,"I tried this glue next to Titebond. I glued 1 piece of Poplar to another piece of Poplar with each glue. Two hours later I tested both bonds. The Titebond held, the wood split. The Gorilla Glue did not hold, it pulled loose form the other piece of wood leaving a slick spot where it had dried."
2,More of a jam session (albeit a strange one.....),"I have purty much everything Tower Recordings did ('cause I love them). This ranks somewhere near the bottom for me, under Furniture Music For Evening Shuttles (their crowning achievement, in my opinion), the Planet TR disc (mystical & incredible) and The Fraternity Of Moonwalkers. I find it more boring than those, maybe because there's not as much diversity in sound or in song (a lot of jamming on a single riff), and there's no weird overdubs. Plus Matt sounds like he's doing his best Neil Young impression. I love Neil, don't get me wrong, but there's something off-putting about it. The tracks kinda meander, and every once in a while, you'll hear some cool keyboard strangeness or bizarre editing, which excites me, but as much as it pains me to say it, the best albums by them are the ones that are currently out of print. This is a little too conventional for my tastes."
2,The Saintly Smiling Pope was Whacked!,"Read, ""In God's Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I "". The poor ""Smiling Pope"" never stood a chance with these money grubbing harlots who whacked him!"
4,Must Know More About This Pope,"After reading ""In God's Name"" by David A. Yallop, I believe we should research more about the life of Albino Luciani. He was certainly for the poor, believed in total honesty. Some Cardinals claimed they had spoken to a saint, after their discourse with him.Unlike what was revealed in the book ""Murder in the Vatican"" by Lucien Gregoire, a book my wife and I called 'PURE DIATRIBE'. I don't understand how anyone can read Gregoire's book and pretend it was accurate."
1,Blades have been outsourced,"I am a paint contractor, and have been using SANDVIK scrapers for 15 years. The name changed to BAHCO, but they were still made in Scandinavia. The replacement blades were also made there... until recently. They still command a premium at $11USD, but have 1/10 THE LIFE!!!!! Where in the past I could use each blade (2 sides) for a MINIMUM of 40 hours with little resistance, I recently noticed my help complaining of dull blades after 2 HOURS!!! Upon checking. I noticed some blades made in Spain, but the majority are from Taiwan! WTF!!! It's a sad day indeed when the king of scrapers are now ""scrap"". I WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT."
5,Panasonic KXTG2550B,"I didn't know how far cordless technology had come until I finally broke down and purchased this phone. All my previous experiences with corless phones have been less than satisfying. The range on this phone is awesome. I can take it with me to the pool 100 yards away and it sounds like I'm using it 10 feet from the base. The caller I.D. function woks well and the phone is small enough that if you are used to talking on a cellular, this is the phone for you. I only wish the base could be wall mounted, but that is minor compared to the overall sound quality of this phone."
2,Not such a good phone...,"I bought the phone almost a year ago (around Nov-Dec of 2000). I love the way the phone looks. I even bought the headset so that I could talk 'hands free' with my family and friends. The phone has great features (caller-id, great phonebook, easy dialing.) However, the love affair is over.In the past couple of months the phone has steadly gotten worse. Lots of static and 'out-of-range' messages. I've bought a new battery for the phone figuring it was a bad battery. But the problems persist. Since DAY-ONE I've had the phone on a computer grade surge suppressor (and phone line supressor) to protect it from power spikes etc.I've read the other reviews. It seems that I'm not alone in the problems that I've had with the unit. I can't recommend that anyone else purchase one. Great design, but I've not been satisfied with the long-term performance or reliabiliy of my phone. I'm in now in the market to purchase a replacement phone. (NOT a PANASONIC one though.)"
1,Disappointed and discouraged....,"I must say that I even cringe to give this phone even one star. I have had my phone one year as of December. The beginning of December, my problems started. I am another victim of the ""out of range"" and incredible static problems. I can have the phone 1 inch from the base and still have it read ""out of range"". As a matter of fact, I had to switch to another phone during my phone call to customer service because this Panasonic kept making a zapping sound in my ear and they were unable to hear me on the other end! They extended my warranty so that I could contact a local service center. I am in a Chicago suburb, yet the closest service center is 1 1/2 hrs away! Try calling there....nobody ever answers, all lines busy, ..the message says to leave a voice mail, only to then say that the mailbox is full. What a waste. I can't believe this item hasn't been recalled. :("
2,time to buy a siemens phone,"My experience mirrors that of the reviewer below. After about three months, my phone would give me 'out of range' messages, even if you're standing right next to the base unit. It would typically happen after sitting on the charger for a long period of time. I tried changing the battery, and it seemed to fix the problem at first, but it soon returned.My phone was a refurb that I bought, so I thought the issue may have been specific to my phone, but reading the reviews here, I see that it's a problem with ALL of their phones. I notice that the newer Panasonic phones here seem to be getting positive reviews...it may be just because the reviewer has had the phone long enough for problems to surface."
5,Best phone I've ever owned!,"I love this phone! I have no idea what these other people are talking about. I owned a Uniden 900Mhz that would produce unbearable static levels when I was two feet from the base. Finally though trial and error I figured out that the problem was that the base was too close to my computer monitor and the magnetic field from the monitor was causing the static. The Panasonic 2.4 is unaffected by where the base or the handset is located and I think it's the best phone ever made. A friend of mine has the same model and we laugh we love our phones so much. Between the two of us we've had two dozen other models before this one and we both agree that this one far outperforms all of the others, not even close. You people with the out of range problems need to locate the base somewhere other than on top of your TV, microwave or the bottom of your pool."
4,One Excellent Cordless Phone,"This phone was well worth the wait for it to become available and the high price (MSRP) I paid for it!I can literally walk around my block while keeping a call going, and the battery strength indicator on the handset is an invaluable tool to let me know when recharging is needed.My only complaint is a software issue within the phone; after using the phone for any length of time, then hanging up, you have to wait around 20 to 30 seconds to allow the phone to go back into standby mode in order to use the built-in phone directory for your next call. This is a strange quirk, and frustrating if you need to make quick back-to-back phone calls from your directory. You may however simply direct-dial another number at any time to avoid this little glitch. Hoping they corrected this problem with the new KX-TG2553 series.Otherwise a truly fantastic phone!"
4,great product but 18 of 24 cans dented and dirty on the outside,"I purchased this particular flavor for a sick senior cat who is slowly loosing her appetite and weight, high calorie item. Good quality ingredients for her, I received the case, the wrapping and box were in perfect shape, but 18 out of 24 cans were badly dented, not leaking, but I won't be feeding it to my cat in case the food is compromised, also the bottom of the cans were all dirty, which I found strange and wonder how that would occur. This flavor is hard to find in the local pet stores, but I won't be purchasing cans online anymore."
2,NOT PLEASED,"The item we purchased was not the item we received. The picture showed a three ring binder with a world map design, they sent a generic green binder. They were willing to exchange it, but we had to pay the postage to send it back. Now we are stuck with a product we are not happy with. As you can tell, we were not pleased with the outcome."
1,YOU CANT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER,"I had decided on a perfect gift for xmas for my son who had been traveling through europe for 4 months.I wanted a photo album to hold all his pictures.I hoped to find just the right cover that might depict worldly travel. I shopped the stores and came up empty handed, so i tried amazon. With over a thousand photo albums to look at i found just what i was looking for. The pictured photo album available through amazon.I happily purchased it paying more for sipping than the item, but i found what i wanted.A week later a blue stripped photo album showed up. I called the company supplying the album and explained my dilema.Nowhere did it say that the type of album was what you were ordering and the assorted covers were at their discretion. The company agreed to a return ship label and full refund never asking if they could send the one pictured.Although i got my money back i didnt get the gift i wanted and spent a lot of valuable time for nothing."
5,Great Machine!,"I work in a public library and we use the 2400 to make the call numbers to attach to our materials - it's wonderful! We process about 1,000 items a month and this machine has never let us down because it's a real workhorse. It's one of those products that has performed exceedingly well in everyday use over many years and I highly recommend purchasing it, particularly becasue it is such a good value.Over the past 8 years, we have used a variety of Brother label machines and I intend to continue using them for a long, long time."
2,Girls Night,Girls NightThis was too much for me. Maybe I am a prude but I was disappointed in it. However the writing was good.
3,Eh,It was okay....I'm not into your basic predictable love story where the main objective is for a woman to get married again. Especially so quickly after meeting someone. If you are some one who is in to romance like that then you may enjoy this book. I also felt it was a little old-fashioned in some of the dialect which made the 38 year old main character come across as older. I like more modern and up to date novels though. Many women I know aren't waiting for some man to come and rescue them anymore.
5,absolutely loved it,I truly loved this book. O lived the characters and the way that they slowly build up to their relationship deepening. It wasn't just flash harm sex love happily ever after. It was a slow sweet build up to love. I also loved the secondary love story that proved that even older people can feel passion and love.
3,"Not bad, but not what I had hoped for...","""Girls Night"" had its charms, but it failed to really hold my attention. I found that I was flipping forward again and again to see how much more I had left to read. I felt that the sub plot overshadowed the romance. I had a very hard time connecting with Jillene and especially Vince. I did however absolutely love Jillene's daughters Claire and Faye. Vince's father Al was also a delight with his lady love Ianella. ""Girls Night"" was certainly not a bad read, but I wouldnt necessarily recommend it."
5,Simply Delightful!,"This book was just what I needed!According the the snippet on the author on the back cover of the book, this is her first contemporary novel. This is probably why I had never heard of someone who captivates so well!I loved so many things about this book - most of all, the warmth of all the characters. And everyone seemed so REAL. There is some kind of strange comfort to reading about Cheeze-Its, Barbie dolls, Al Pacino, Ray Bans ... I guess the pop culture references make the characters come to life.I really enjoyed Jillene ... she was not perfect, and so like a real life mother and widow. I loved reading about Claire and Faye (Jillene's daughters ages 12 and 10) the relationship was brought to life with a series of scenes that anyone who has a sister could relate to.Overall this was just a real pleasure to read, highly recommend!"
4,Enjoyable,Subtle humor at times. The dilemma of the pull of attraction vs what should be common sense. Love problems for the father and son. Would read something else bt this author.
3,"Girls Night - OK, Not Great","I enjoyed the sub-plots of this story more than what I assume was the main story. I suffered with the former cop turned author and his dilemma, wondering how he would resolve it. It was particularly interesting to me how the author portrayed the way the two generations feel about love or maybe lust. The story was slow in many places. It was OK, not great. If you can get the book at a price you're willing to gamble, go for it. You just might like it more than I did."
4,A romance novel with a real moral dilemma,"This book held my interest and was an enjoyable read. The main characters were realistic and likeable, (if a bit too perfect - you'll wait a long time if you're waiting for the guy), although the others were cartoonish. I liked the moral dilemma that the hero faced, which made the situation more substantive than most. Living as I do on an island in Puget Sound, I found the scene well-described. The free kindle book was a good way to get acquainted with this capable author."
4,Not a romance fan,Better than thought it would be. Not as predictable as some romance books. Book kept me interested as to what's to come.
3,Girls night was okay,"Girls Night was a good book,I could put it down and not get back to it right away. It was still a feel good book in the end."
5,Girls Night,I thought this book was spectacular!!! I could not put it down...the characters in the book were so real and could easily be related to. I can't wait for her to write another bookAnnette
2,get to the payoff,"I have to wonder how many pages the author was required to write for this book. The story line could have easily been wrapped up in 175 pages. The title itself leads you to think it will be a different book, but it turns out to be your typical romance with lots of sexual tension. The jacket of the book even tells of a different kind of story, leading you to believe that this book will be edgy. It made me edgy just to have to finish it. I could have skipped over the entire middle and still have been at the same place. Get to the payoff, already!"
2,Save your 8 bucks,"I started reading this book with high expectations due to the good reviews and can only say that I have not been so bored with a book in a long time. I found the plot formulaic, the heroine unlikeable, and, even though the book was marketed as a romantic comedy, it failed to tickle my funny bone even once during the entire reading. Despite the author's efforts to make the heroine seem tough, to me she came off as unreasonable and extremely incompetent. The only redeeming quality of the book was the likable hero but even that wasn't enough for me to recommend anyone to spend 8 hard earned bucks on this book."
5,I loved it!,"This is truly a fun read from beginning to end. Not only will you fall in love with Vince, you'll admire Jillene as she struggles to take care of her coffee shop and her girls. Jillene's not looking for love but that's exactly what she finds when the good-looking true crime author comes to town, and there's more than coffee steaming between Jillene and Vince! Don't miss it!"
4,Great Read,I enjoyed reading this book. I will be reading more from this author. Awesome. The kids touched me dearly. With the way they wanted their mom happy. Touching
3,"She's broke, he doesn't want to write the book....that's 300 page of the book!","I actually really enjoyed the 1st 1/2 of this story.Liked the slow build up to the romance, hated the hot/cold story telling though.Liked the dad's little love story, it was sweet. His actually had more going for it than his sons. If it wasnt so on/off, happening/not happening it would have been more believable.By about 3/4 of the way through I started skimming until I decided to just go to the end and founbd out exactly the ending I thought would happen.It's suh a shame because like I said, the 1st 1/2 I found great & didnt want to put my kindle down."
3,recommended by therapist,"this book was recommended by a therapist, and even though we are trying to read it, it isn't something you want to go back to."
2,Too long,"I think he could have written in 200 words or less that he hated John Orr, thinks cops are better than firemen, and thinks prosecutors should always have the upper hand.One thing he could have included was photos, to make the book less boring. And, he could have explained just how we went from the judge disallowing Orr's manuscripts into evidence to the prosecution being allowed to use them as evidence."
4,Disturbing,"A disturbing story, still well written and at times quite funny. I guess I was most shocked about the way the mind of this guy works, showing no feelings for the victims but instead writing a story about it. Shocking and disturbing."
3,What Wambaugh Does Best,"James Wambaugh has a long and somewhat successful history of writing both fictional and non-fictional stories. From Onionfield to The Blooding his style remains the same, detailed but fast-paced enough to always keep the reader interested with the feeling that he has been there and done all this before. The greatest criticism of Wambaugh is his sometimes quirky use of syntax, which leaves the reader with the question of what is the meaning of his sentence or paragraph. Putting that aside, as in The Blooding, Wambaugh makes a factual and sometimes boring story come alive for the reader of Fire Lover. He even did quite well in the middle of the book when he had to cover the second trial and all of its detail without being too repetitious and going over all that went on in the first trial. After all there is only so much you can write about a fire and keep the reader's interest alive. In all, I liked the book and give it my recommendation."
3,"Totally biased, arrogant author","This is the first Wambaugh book that I've read. I've heard lots of good things about his books. I work in law enforcement and have enjoyed other true crime books written by former law enforcement personnel, so thought I would Wambaugh as well. I had seen the documentary about John Orr and wanted to know more.However, although the author is an excellent writer, this book was very biased and Wambaugh comes across to me as very arrogant -- a trait that I cannot tolerate under any circumstance. In fact, his bias that police officers are better than firefighters is downright cocky.Although I knew the story of John Orr and felt he was guilty, while reading Fire Lover, I found myself wanting him to get off from page to page because of the cockiness of the writer.I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,Outstanding and Excitable,"As a huge Fan of his books, The Onion Field still the best and now Fire Lover, as a former fireman I can relate to the procedures and politics alike. I agree that the court testimony and trial lasted a bit too long. I'm glad to see that Joe is back and still capable of producing true crime books with everyday people doing unthinkable acts against others. Keep it up Joe!!!"
2,Just a few items,"Rather than go into an in-depth review, I'll just make note of a couple of things that I found to detract from this book. Wambaugh notes that John Orr set a number of fires over a period of several years. A chart listing the fires and their dates (and, even better, a map of their locations) would have made the narrative much easier to follow, but alas there's nothing of the sort. I repeatedly found myself paging back through the book when Wambaugh mentioned a fire that had occurred months or years earlier. Photographs also would have helped. Wambaugh notes that Orr's completely ordinary, undistinguished appearance made it easier for him to escape notice when he set fires in occupied businesses. It would have been nice if we could have seen for ourselves. Finally, whenever Wambaugh refers to a vehicle making a U-turn - which he does incessantly - he uses the very annoying phrase ""pulling a U-ee."" Please, a little less slang would be appreciated."
2,Strange,"Wambaugh returns with a fascinating bad guy, a fire captain arsonist, but the story bogs down in trial transcripts and we are left luke warm. Worth the read, but not up to the earlier works by the author."
4,Fire Lover :: An Excellent Book,"Fire Lover has a depressing and sad beginning, but later on, turns into a wonderful novel worth reading. Mr. Wambaugh gave a good non-biased description of the tragic events that happened those few years."
1,He just hates him......,"I have enjoyed Wambaugh's other true crime books, and watched for this one to go on the Best Seller lists. When it didn't, I decided to buy it anyway.....And I wish I hadn't. Wambaugh obviously despises the man he refers to as ""the fire lover"". He holds him in such contempt that this is in no way an unbiased account, but on the contrary it is a diatribe against this man. Admittedly, the ""fire lover"" has done some despicible things, but, please, let the reader come to that conclusion. Why write 338 pages about a man you hate? Spare me......I'll read a more objective account of this in the newspapers."
4,"Fascinating Story, Two Flaws","As someone who read and enjoyed ""The Onion Field,"" ""The Blue Knight,"" ""The New Centurions,"" ""The Blooding,"" and ""The Secrets of Harry Bright,"" I was happy to see that Wambaugh served us up another fascinating true crime story, one about someone who was probably the most prolific arsonist in American history. The story of how John Orr was brought to justice is intriguing and gripping, without wallowing in grisly details.I do have to deduct a star from my review for two reasons:1. Just as he berates the lawyers trying the case for subjecting the juries to too much detail, the author overdoes it himself on occasion.2. As a related point, some of the evidence Wambaugh cites would have been much easier to understand with some pictures, diagrams, and timelines. Yet these, as in his other true crime stories, are absent."
4,Very American!,"These chants not only demonstrate the intonation and rhythm of American English, they are American culture at its best. If you have been speaking American English all your life, you hear yourself and laugh because the small talk chants are so typically American. I have used the chants and worksheets with beginners and intermediate students in the upper elementary grades. The students have enjoyed them and the worksheets that go with them. At first, it's hard for everyone, but the students get the hang of it and look forward to new ones."
4,Good product,"I've had very good luck with this brand. I've used it for the last 5 years in woodorking, and thus far, my only complaint is that I wished it lasted longer (I'm cheap, and wish everything lasted longer)."
2,Nice Photographs -- Low On Original Information:,"While Baker-Kreuger's ""Toy Fox Terriers"" is 192 pages long, only the first 32 pages are breed specific, and ten of those pages were simply copied from the breed standard. Although there are a lot of nice photographs, there is very little original information presented. I would not call this an authoritative book on Toy Fox Terriers, but rather a cut and paste collection of general dog information."
2,"Toy Fox Terriers, by Sherry Baker Krueger","Some good pictures at the beginning of the book. But the rest of the book has no real insight on much else. The book closes with a lot of unnecessary information just on dogs in general--not the toy fox terrier. If you're wanting to buy a book on TFT's, then keep looking."
5,This is an excellent book from knowing TFT to training!,This book is very infomative. The TFT book will help you know everything there is to know about your TFT. It will help you train and take care of your puppy to an adult. The book also gives health care tips to breeding your dog. The book also offers some wonderful pictures of TFT.
1,Nothing like the Original,"John Kennedy's book was a real treat, but I am sorry to say that this book is not. Caroline Kennedy does her best to copy the idea and concept of her father's book, but the same quality material is not present. The Publisher's attempt to copy the past and to capitalize on the Kennedy name falls very, very flat. Sometimes imitation is not the best form of flattery!"
1,"Should have sold 142 copies to Kennedy Family, but...",This book gives 'cashing in' a bad name. Inept profiles of questionable courage. Caroline should be ashamed to trade on her deceased father's name this way.
3,Some profiles better than others,"The ""profiles"" in this update to JFK's classic, are varied in both their subjects and their presentation. These accounts are not uniform in quality. Most stirring are those with a personal flavor such as Bob Woodward's profile of Gerald Ford, wherein we see a hidden profile of Woodward as well. However, others seem either too detached or tediously narrative, such as Michael Daly's ""The Irish Peacemakers"" which outlines the alphabet soup of the political/religious strife in Ireland, but does little to connect the overall themes of courage to anything outside the situation.It is a good read, but not all the selections hold interest. I'd recommend particular excerpts for good classroom reading. I also commend the acknowledgement of politicians, leaders, and activists on both local and global levels."
1,Hyping the Kennedy Name for Dollars,"Well, I never thought I would see the day, but even Caroline is cashing in on the Kennedys. There was a lot of hype about this book. I think it would have been much, much more interesting if Caroline had written it herself, weaving her own memories and thoughts of these PIC Award winners, as well as their biographical profiles. Just having big name writers doesn't do it. That said, these are truly people who showed genuine courage in politics. The Congresswoman's story was most interesting and I would have liked to know even more. A new view of Ford is also shown. But again, just using her famous name instead of using these not very good but well-hyped writers...somehow I can't imagine her mother, or her brother ever doing that."
5,Rich in Color and Style!,"A wonderful reference book in styles and shapes of flowers, leaves, fish and colors. Great to use for resources by many artists. Birthe shows you how to break up a design into repeat patterns, sizes, and designs. She has wonderful flowing motifs. Great use of colors, soft to vibrant. This book should be in all artist library."
5,DVD Available - amazon.co.uk,"Just to let those looking for Riddle Of The Sands on DVD, it is available in the UK, Region 2 I know, but that is not a major problem!"
4,love this fim,"like everybody, I do wish this was available on DVD but it's still a great movie! I love trying to justify the plot to kids lol"
2,I hope you have the taps to thread your own holes!,"I have the original bar for the Accu-Miter and thought I would upgrade to the ""new and improved"" bar. Was I surprised when I found out the new bar was not tapped for the screws that hold the indexing pin on. Looks like the factory overlooked this ""small"" detail. Theoretically you screw the allen head screws down to tighten and spread the nylon spacers on the bar to make them expand and fit the miter slot. I tightened these screws until the allen wrench bent and the nylon spacers didn't spread a hair - another good idea in theory but not in reality. I will keep the bar, but I can see that it will take some ""rigging"" to get to work as advertised. Let the buyer beware."
3,Not as pictured,"The picture of the inside of this album shows a place for two 4x6 photos per page, each in a ""landscape"" (vs. ""portrait"") orientation. However the album actually only has space for one 4x6 per page, and only in the ""portrait"" (i.e. vertical) orientation. The album seems to be of a nice quality and in other respects appears to match its description, so if a 1 photo per page, vertically oriented album is what you're looking for, this is probably a decent choice."
4,"Great book, but will students use it?","I think this is a great book and I'll be using it myself here when I teach two courses called ""Learning Strategies for History. While I found it very useful, I'm wondering how useful a student attempting to use it alone would find this book. The suggested exercises are good but without feedback some motivation may be lacking. So, if you thought of getting this for your child or spouse or whoever who is having difficulty with a history course, do it but be willing to read it with them and give them feedback as they try to put some of the suggestions and information into practice."
2,"Good looking, but not very comfortable","I though it could be my favorate shoes, but it's not comfatable for walking even short distance. I just put it away and wear my ""easy spirite"" shoe every day."
1,?????????????????,"Hi, I just feel like giving this book a bad review because I don't like ferrets. They're vicious and they bite. Have a nice day."
4,Rescue Ferrets at Sea,My husband and I listened Air Ferrets on a long trip recently. We enjoyed it enough for me to order Rescue Ferrets at Sea and Writer Ferrets. They all seem to drag a little in the middle but they come to great conclusions and we enjoyed them very much. Had sent them on to my kids.
5,"AORTA, NICE RECORD","I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS RECORD, IS ALMOST CLASSICAL INTO THE ROCK MUSIC. IT IS NOT POP, BUT PROGRESIVE, SOFT TUNED, WELL PLAYED."
1,Really bad,"OK, Anna May Wong didn't get the part in The Good Earth which went to a European about 70 years ago. Get over it; most of us have! Typical academic whine in which everything is wrong and nothing is right with America. No credit is given for repealing racist laws, expanding tolerance and opportunity. Authors think the Weathermen and Bobby Seale had something important to say. Omits many interesting and most positive aspects of the Chinese immigrant saga in America."
2,Portable but flimsy,"This is a great idea, however not perfected. First we never even took it anywhere and in less than a month one of the keys stopped working. It does not give the feel of a piano and has no external power adapter so you will go through batteries."
1,do not buy,"I bought this, and it does not work. It has to be returned. Perhaps a model a little more expensive will be better."
2,the bull-in-a-china-shop of glues,"This stuff would be great if you needed to glue California to Arizona to keep it from falling into the ocean...for any other application, it's total overkill. I was warned about the foaming, but it foams AFTER you have everything set and clamped (or weighted down). If you're doing anything other than skyscraper construction or building weight-bearing walls in your house, buy something else."
1,"Maybe glue, but NOT good for woodworking!",Fine woodworking rated this glue as the poorest woodworking glue by far. Has less than HALF the strength of Titebond 3 glue (the best). I also found that it quickly dries up in the bottle.
4,Has its uses.,"This is a very good strong bonding glue formula, but I find that its not valuable in some applications. For example I used this to put a velcro patch on a piece of foam and it worked great. I have stressed the patch and no problems.However, in furnature applications this glue is a waste of time. It is as stated before tricky to use and time consuming. When you are glueing a project up I want to be done quickly and accuratly. This glue may give accuracy, but speed is questionable and the end result is sub par. It does leave a stain and it does leave allot of work after it has dried. My recomendation is to use a good yellow glue like titebond which gives a superior joint and it is easy to work with all around.So in summation think about the end result that you wish to achieve with this glue because it does have its place, but furnature construction is not one of them."
2,Gorilla Glue cleanup,"Gorilla Glue is a great glue, holds strong, but don't use it on ceramics! I used it to glue a ceramic/porcelain foo dog. An hour later I saw the hard, foam-like ooze coming from each seam! I ended up having to scrape it off with a sharp edged knife. For the remainder I had to use fine steel wool soaked in mineral spirits. It took a long time but eventually it came off."
2,Didn't work like original..,Tried gluing two pieces of like-kind plastics together and it lasted a day. Luckily I had just enough of the old original 2 part product left to make the repair.
4,Great sandals,I am very pleased with these sandals but probably would like not as much sandal at the front of the shoe but this is because I have very small toes! I love birkenstock clogs and sandals and find them very comfortable on tired feet.
5,Love 'Em!,I absolutely love my Birkenstock Floridas. I only wish I had bought them years ago. Comfortable and easy to slip on and go. Worth every penny. My only suggestion is to buy these from Endless--they have free return shipping (at least at the moment?!) if you buy the wrong size like I did the first time.
1,please buy better Birkenstocks,"I have been wearing Birkenstock sandals for fourteen years, and have loved every pair that I have purchased. Except these, which I will be returning immediately. I don't know what the upper portion of the sandals are made of, but it is not leather or suede, or anything that would last as long as I expect my Birkenstocks to last. If these shoes cost $25 or $30 I could maybe live with this man-made material, but not for $65 or more per pair. Please read carefully before you purchase your next pair of Birkenstock sandals, and make sure that they have leather uppers."
2,Not as described,"I always wear Birkies. I love them for their comfort as well as their great craftmanship. These Birkies were described as having leather uppers but they were the ""birko-flor"" when I received them. I don't have objections to this material, but for $98 I expect leather. Especially when leather is indicated. I can get the birko-flor cheaper locally.I see that Amazon has changed the description from leather upper to birko-flor. I'm glad to see that."
1,DON'T TRUST THE DESCRIPTION!!!!,"The description clearly said LEATHER uppers, and the photo was of LEATHER, too -- but the ones I got have SYNTHETIC (i.e., cheaper quality) uppers. In looking at comments on other items in this category, apparently Amazon has a HUGE problem with inaccurate description on Birkenstock shoes. They have just one generic description for each style of shoe which specifies composition -- but then they have all sorts of different ones actually for sale in that style. No way at all to tell what you are ordering unless the one you pull up specifically says in its ""size/color title"", ""Birko-Flor"" or whatever for that item -- but most of them don't, as they just say the size and color. Amazon needs to quit selling these until it gets it right!!! Free returns, but lots of aggravation, time, effort and disappointment involved. I can't get an exchange, of course, because I can't trust the description. Very disappointed."
1,wrong size,"I'm sorry, but I won't order Birkenstock by mail again. I ordered 37, which was supposed to be an American size 7, but I received a size 6. They are quite too small, but it was not worth the effort to return. I will wear them some in the summer, but, as I said, I will not purchase this way again. The comfort of Birkenstock is missing. Very disappointing."
1,Don't believe advertisement,"Advertised as leather-are not leather. I paid more than other offfers of same sandal because they were adverised as leather and paid for shipping expecting leather uppers. Shipping took longer than advertised and came in a plastic bag, no box to protect during shipping and to store them in."
1,"This is actually nubuck, even though it's not described as such","This is actually nubuck, even though it's not described as such. Also, the soft footbed apparently makes the sandal narrower, and consequently, uncomfortable"
1,"I love Birkenstock sandals, but.....","I love Birkenstock sandals, but Amazon keeps sending me the soft footbed instead of the original footbed sandal. There is a big difference between the two and I don't get the support I need with the soft footbed. This has happened three times. It says that it is a soft footbed on the box and on the sandal but it is written in German on the box and I think the shipping clerks can't read the German, and don't realize that they are shipping me the soft footbed. Very frustrating. I had to ship back to Amazon four times. I've given up."
5,"I love, Love, love my birkenstocks",I reccomend birkenstocks to anyone with plantar fascitis. Birkenstocks have taken the pain out of my feet. Now I have my black sandles for next summer and they look and feel great.
2,Misleading Ad,"The ad didn't state that these Florida Birks were not leather. I love Floridas but need leather to make my feet happy. I spent a miserable hour on the computer, trying to generate the electronic form so that I could return these shoes, but I got stuck in an endless ""amazon loop."" Finally, I found the customer service email request for a phone call, which I then quickly received. The amazon representative was very helpful, and I have returned these shoes for a full refund and ordered a pair of leather ones from ebay. The vendors that sell through amazon are usually great, so this experience was an anomaly, but because of the good outcome, I will definitely use amazon again."
4,The Baby of Macon,"DVD was in good condition but will not play on a DVD player, only on a computer, which is fine but important to know. The story is one that is challenging to watch and provocative in nature. Fine acting by Julia Ormond and Ralph Finnes."
2,Revenge,A Prince of the Church revenges the strange death of his son by sentencing the alledged culprit to death by mass rape.
3,Not what I expected,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the workouts themselves are fine,however,I did not like the music used in this DVD. It is a low,droning music with a bass voice chanting/singing. It is not conducive to a peaceful workout and instead became so irritating that I could not continue. There are only two options with the sound; instruction with music or music only. I do not know the workout flow well enough to simply turn off the sound altogether. Since the music is so distinctive and different from the usual, I think it should be mentioned in the description, or an option of instruction only should be available."
4,Short Segments,"I love yoga workouts with shorter segments. This workout is not the same relaxing stuff I have tried before. I actually find her yoga workouts more strength and challenging then her Pilates workouts, which make me feel stretched. The instructions are clear, although he is constantly reminded you about breath which can get old. I like that it's voiced over so the cues remain clear and audible. I do like her Weight Loss Yoga dvd better then this one though so if you had to choose, I would go with that one over this."
4,"A Moving experience, worth reading!","Should a young widow and her brother-in-law marry at a reguest in the first husband's will? Is this Biblical concept meant for today? Is marrying for convenience enough? The stuggles encountered by this couple are quite moving. Each seeks honor, but each finds the desires of their heart in the process. A good read!"
2,"T-9 good, rust remover scary","The Boeshield T-9 is a great product. Yes, it's sticky, but it even says on the instructions to rub it off quickly for a smooth surface. It contains a thin paste wax, so if you buff it a little it's even smoother. I haven't had a problem with it.The rust remover is a whole different thing. Yes, it removes rust some, not great, but some. However, it contains phosporic acid which will stain iron if used in small amounts. If you have a leak in your bottle (like me) and you set the bottle on your table saw, then it will literally eat pits into the cast iron table and react to form some funky crusty black iron oxide stuff that is really hard to clean off.My recommendation, buy the T-9 and hide the rust remover from yourself before you really damage something."
1,Crap!,"This product is crap! You'd be better off using kerosene and a tooth brush.I was told that this product worked great on rust, well believe me when I tell you that it did more harm than it did help, it left my machinery with leopard spots.I'm very unhappy with the results, you would think that for $30 you'd get a better product."
5,Good,"Ms Buth takes a brave stab at a tricky subject. My dad bought it to try to explain sex to my sister and me but handed his copy to me saying that confident talk was no substitute for reading it for myself. ... Still, it strikes me as a sound treatment and a useful guide."
3,A nice little extra filler,"DJ Shadow is back, and you can whet your appetite for his new full length cd, The Private Press, with this single. The lead track appears on the album, and is pretty much what you'd expect from Shadow. Disavowed is a nice change of pace, and features ex-Rage Against the Machine singer Zack De La Rocha on additional drums and production. The last track, Treach Battle Beats is merely the drum beat from Walkie-Talkie (on Private Press) with a few extra scratches and samples. This is definitly worth the $$$"
4,Shadow's Back,"This single is a great taster for the upcoming album. I want to hear more. ""You Can't Go Home Again"" suprised me. Very different from what I expected. It is a 'radio edit' so I imagine the album version will be quite an experience.The b-sides (?), ""Disavowed"" and ""Treach Battle Beats"", are more like what I expected. Do note ""additional production and live drums by Zack de la Rocha"" on ""Disavowed"".I only gave it 4 out of 5 but I've only listened to it twice so far. If it doesn't grow on me, I'm sure the full length CD will be great."
5,Fantastic Book !,"If you want to know how to make shoes or just want to know how shoes are made this is the best book that you can buy. Every page has beautiful closeup color photographs. Just by looking at the photographs alone shows you how it is done and there are many, many, photographs showing you every stage in the process of hand making a pair of men's shoes."
4,Gentlemens' Shoe Bible,"The great tradition of shoemaker's art is explained here with passion, precision and clarity. Contrasting with the venerable British bespoke shoemaker John Lobb, the sophistication and subtleness of Ausro-Hungarian shoemaker Laszlo Vass reflect the glories of an empire long gone by. A must for Gentlemens' reference library."
3,Handmade shoes for men,"Thank you. Difficulty is getting equipments and tools. More information would be appreciated. Some of them do not exist anymore, so where does one go?"
5,Good beginner's book,Good beginner's book .Shows the process and has more information on workshops to attend In case you really enjoy making your own shoes.
4,Great phrasebook for the traveller,"Like most Lonely Planet products, this is a well-organized and handy guide to the language."
2,If you have money to waste...,"This book is a novelty at best, perhaps something to browse over on the plane over to East Africa, or something to put on the bookshelf when yo get back, but chances are you're never gonna REALLY use it. Best bet is to print some useful phrases off the internet and take those along, and save whatever this book would cost for some Tuskers once you get over there. If you actually want to learn the language definitely do not waste your time, Baba Malaika makes some good dictionaries, and take a course at a university or just go live over there, and be prepared to put a lot of time into it.. But this phrasebook = WASTE OF MONEY!!"
2,Pretty useless in the field,"No real help in deciphering or translating Kiswahili as written in Facebook. Some of the cultural material was ok, but the book will fail you in the field as far as communicating in simple everyday Kiswahili."
3,A few errors from what I can see.,I was going through my personal copy of this book alongside my iPhone UTalk App and decided to check the book against its own dictionary at the back.Well it claims in the Quick Ref guide that Salama means hello yet it's own dictionary states that *Habari = Hello* and **Salama = Safe** which is quite worrying and makes me wonder if the book is actually correct and how many people are potentially learning the wrong words.
3,Pronunciation key is wrong,"There are many things in life I don't understand.This is one of them.On page 11, it says:""There are no diphthongs in Swahili (i.e. vowel sound combinations, like in English 'day'.)""Then, in chart below (paraphrasing), book instructs:""Symbol 'ay' will be pronounced like 'may,' so 'wewe' will be pronounced 'wayway.'""BUT WAIT, you just said there were NO DIPHTHONGS as in ""day.""Now you're going to have us pronounce EVERY ""E"" as an incorrect DIPHTHONG?(""Wewe"" is pronounced like ""e"" in English ""leg."" It rhymes with ""heh heh,"" not ""hey-hey"". Why? Because it's not a diphthong!)This might not be a big deal, except every time I read, I now have to ""auto-correct"" myself for the book's mistake (""ay"" is pronounced ""e"" as in ""leg""), every time.And readers who don't catch the book's error will be pronouncing with an unmistakable accent.Seems like someone there just turned off their thinking cap for a moment, and steered the whole book in a decidedly less useful direction."
4,Travel in Tanzania,"Very helpful for basic communication in Eastern AFrica; however, I would recommend also a Swahili dictionary, as this phrase book seems insufficient if one is interested in spontaneous dialogue."
3,It's not the movie,"When you order this movie check carefully. This is not Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" the movie; it is a USO show. It has talented actors and singers, but it is not the movie."
2,Bing Crosby's White Christmas,"I should have read the review first before ordering, It's so important and helpful before making the decision.There was only one Christmas song from this DVD,Bing Crosby White Christmas, the rest of the songs was before my time, the picture clarity was poor, I didn't watch it all. I don't recommend this DVD."
5,impressive,I have a camera takes beautiful pics but has a huge lag time between pics so i have bought numerous cards claiming to cut that down this is the only one that works it cut the time in half i love it thanks.
3,Regular product @ double-priced,"I use this in my digital camera. It works fine, a bit slower while taking pictures or copying them to my computer. I didn't face much of problem because I am not a photography enthusiast or a professional photographer. But, this is certainly not the product for professionals.More over, it's over-priced. It should be no more than $15 to $20.May be less, if the demand is too low! :-)."
3,Kingston Ultimate 120X SD card 2GB,"This review is for the Kingston Ultimate 120X SD card 2GB. I've used this card in my Canon SD870 and SD800, it does not increase photo times for those cameras. Nor is it any faster reading and writing to my laptop than a cheap SanDisk 2GB card (read 37MB in 5-6s, write 37MB in 10files in 14s). Not recommended."
2,Ultimate 2GB slower than my Elite 2GB,"Bought the Ultimate 2GB 120X card as a deal with the Canon A570IS. Set my Canon SD400 camera for continuous shooting and held button for 1min fixed focused on a stop watch. With the Ultimate SD was able to take 95 shots, and the camera frequently showed busy. With my Kingston 2GB Elite 50X card was able to take 121 shots in 1min and camera never showed busy. Both cards were low level formated in the camera. Got similar results using the A570IS, but didn't count the shots. I'm very dissapointed the Ultimate performed slower than the Elite! Maybe a just got a bum Ultimate card? Also got the same good results with a Elite 1GB card. Maybe I should have just stuck with Elite, or another brand..."
1,How could they ruin this?!,I was puzzled when IDS was dropped by bodybuilding.com and I bought it from another vendor.New packaging and totally new formula.If you can call shit a formula.Cholesterol jumped from 8 to 40 mg?!Fat 1g. to 3.5g.Carb 5g. to 7g.And calories jumped to 150 a scoop.AND IT TASTES LIKE ASS!!!Sicky sweet and no chocolate or vanilla flavour.Really IDS? Really?!No freakin love.
4,A Letter to Three Wives,"I purchased this movie for my father who recalled to me that he had tried to find this movie here in Australia. I found it here on Amazon and purchased it for him. I watched this movie with some hesitation as I am not familiar with old black and white movies. This movie from 1949 kept my attention throughout with it's slick photography, direction, and plot. I was impressed with the cast and the acting. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a well scripted and acted movie. The remastering to DVD was excellent even on playback to high definition screen. Five stars from me. (Daniel Hume)"
4,A Letter to three Wives,"I love this movie, but I still can't figure out when left with who. If you like comedy, drama and little mystery, you will love this movie. A young Jeanne Crain is the star of this movie, but they are some great looking ladies in this movie, and for you ladies and a young and dashing Kirk Douglas."
5,Finally on DVD,"Joseph Mankiewicz won two Oscars for this movie for writing thescreenplay and directing the movie. A year later he would repeatthis triumph for ALL ABOUT EVE. Even though the script could beconsidered a bit dated now it is still so witty and clever thatnobody cares. I always wanted to ask him why Thelma Ritter receives no billing even though her part was bigger than theones by Barbara Lawrence and Florence Bates. Darnell, Sothern andCrain have the best roles of their careers. This is a movie Ican watch over and over and never tire of it. I think my favoritescenes are in Darnell's kitchen when the train goes by. And wesee a great featured performance by Connie Gilchrist. Manythanks to Fox for finally getting this out on dvd."
4,A truly entertaining gem.,"Though the story of three women wondering which of their husbands has run off with the town man-trap may seem a little dated, the script and direction by Mankiewicz, and the top-notch performances make this a memorable pleasure.Mankiewicz would go on to create the classic ""All About Eve,"" of course. And if you've never seen the wonderful Ann Sothern play anything more than lightweight comedies, you have to catch this. The stunning Linda Darnell is also a terrific foil for blustering Paul Douglas (no relation to Kirk Douglas who also is very good here). AND the always sensational Thelma Ritter and the offscreen voice of Celeste Holm, both to later appear memorably in ""...Eve."" (Holm had already won an Oscar for Makiewicz's ""Gentleman's Agreement.)Well worth your time."
5,A classic black and white movie with great actresses,I loved this movie if just for the opportunity to see Linda Darnell. A woman's movie for sure but you won't be disappointed.
3,mind games about marriage,The narrator Celeste Holm is never seen as the husband stealinganti-hero of the movie. There very different woman have to face the realities of their marriages. This qualifies as a classic chick flick/ romantic comedy.I liked it but the acting in places leaves one thinking theywere just reading the lines?I enjoyed both Ann Southern and Linda Darnell in this movie.Kirk Douglas was a surprise as he was a tough guy/ action hero during this time?
3,Dated but interesting social document,"This is a film that has not aged well. The 1948 concerns of women moving in post-war American middle class suburbia are just not biting today. In fact the most interesting characters are those played by Kirk Douglas and Paul Douglas as two of the husbands. The ""clever"" dialogue is not that clever today - still it does have a few laughs. An interesting social document of the period. Includes a good commentary in the DVD extras."
4,Great Quality,"I bought this for an ""old"" friend that wore out his VHS tape. I was amazed at the B&W; quality image of a 1949 Academy award winner.I didn't care much for the story, but I didn't watch it all either.My wife did and she liked it.I think it is a chick movie in disguise."
2,The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.,"This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a ""pure"" movie review I recommend you also see the 'The Internet Movie Database'.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."
5,An innovative master of her art,"I discovered Kari's work on her Facebook page, and was excited to find out she had written a book. Sadly, the book is out of print, but at least you can still find it on Amazon from third party sellers.This is an instruction book as well as a beautifully illustrated book. Kari's techniques are advanced, but the instructions are well done and should steer most people through the process. She shows things like double walled baskets, the ""Hairy"" technique (where spokes protrude out of the basket in a delightful contemporary appearing way) and she uses dyes like a paint pallete.In addition, there is a wonderful gallery of photos from other basketry artists. I highly recommend this book!"
1,"Be clear: this seller is offering only one cable clamp in this package, not 25","I like this cable clamp product and have purchased it in the past. This time, when I wanted to get some more of them, I thought why not see if I can get them from Amazon.com? I found this item on Amazon.com and read the previous review which indicates that the consumer purchase a pack of 25 of the item from the seller. So, I expected that I, too, would receive a pack of 25 cable clamps from the seller.However, when the package arrived, it contained only 1 (one) cable clamp!This product usually retails for about $1 each. However, the seller is offering it for $7.19--a mark-up of over 700%.Do yourself a favor, and get this item, but get it direct from the company, or from another seller, at a more reasonable cost."
5,Excellent historical document,Paine did an excellent job of conveying Americans to fight for independence from Britain. This is a marvelous and accurate version of one of his most memorable works.
3,Not For Me,I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps and books. I downloaded this book and realized it wasn’t for me. It bored me very quickly. I downloaded other books such as Sherlock Holmes from Amazon’s library and am content with what I have. This book is not for me…but maybe you’ll like it.
3,"Oh lord, abook on common sense","Hard to follow the dilect, intresting reading once you get into it. Dilect could have been updated. Took awhile to read, but found this book to be rather intresting."
3,A classic although outdated political exposition,A fine enough theoretical pamphlet that to this day has some take away to it. It is equally dated however in its assumptions to the role of a monarch over that of an elected body.
5,good to have background,I enjoyed reading a book I have heard quoted so often over the years-from college history to lots of political discussions about why our government has become what it has become. Makes me feel a little more whole to have read this quick read.
4,Very good,"Very good. Nothing fancy, just the actual text of the flyer published and circulated by Payne. Easy to read. Very illuminating. Payne was very good at giving reasons to fight for independence."
5,Have Not Read It Yet? Be Ashamed!,"Thomas Paine's Common Sense was the first ""best-seller"" on this side of the ocean. More importantly, it captured the mind and spirit of the Revolution in a brief, readable format. Common Sense is not so much a book as it is a great essay that you wish would not end. Knowing his audience well, Paine traces the origins of monarchy to Saul (not exactly God's choice for the children of Israel) and, for Britains, William the Conqueror (""a French Bastard"" with ""armed banditti""). With wit and sarcasm, he destroys the argument that anarchy is the only alternative to monarchy, blasts the notion that the moral development of a nation is dependent upon the presence of a king and humiliates colonists willing to cling to a poor parent (England). Paine's approach to politics is entirely American and it is easy to see why George Washington called Common Sense his favorite book."
4,Amazing,"Amazing how applicable the text is to modern American government oppression. Through our elected officials we have visited the same harm upon ourselves as England desired in the 18th century, but our politicians have gone much further than the king ever did."
5,Timeless evaluation of the human prospective,"I read this in print many years ago, and forgot much of the content. The observations are timeless, and to the point, they apply directly to our own government and world governments today. It is scary to realize how much more fluent the author and his prospective early American readers were, than I am. The written words are beautiful, and convey deeper and more colorful meaning then any of the 20th century treatises I have read."
5,Another Gem From Thomas Paine,"In his usual clarity and tact, Paine makes a rational and reasoned case for independence. It is said that Common Sense was THE catalyst for uniting the colonies to fight against Great Britain. After reading it, I can understand why. A short but very powerful book. Definitely worth the read."
3,I started to get bored,"I wrote an essay on this book in high school, which I got a scholarship from it. Back then, I was into reading books. I just wanted to see what impressed me about the book to write an essay. My tastes in books have changed over the years and I am just not into reading that kind of literature any more."
2,Hard to Read - Lost Interest,"I thought this would be an interesting book to read but it was not. I tried to make honest effort to read it and told myself that I could overcome the language of the time, but I could not."
5,Common sense,In my opinion Thomas Paine was one of the smarter of the founding fathers. Along with Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. He put his name on a number of the most prestigous documents written in that time.
5,MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT,"Thomas Paine was a man truly blessed with a keen, observant mind. I rate this book on my 10 most favorite reads. Everyone would profit from reading this book. Thomas Paine is the TRUE father of our freedom JIM"
3,not for me,i did not understand this book. that is why i rate it so low on the scale.though other people may not agree with me i do understand
5,NOW it's considered common sense.,"This is a must-read for all Americans. These are the acorns of thought that grew into the oaks of our constitution. While we can look back upon the text and feel much of this is ""obvious"", during Paine's time it was provocative and even treasonous."
3,A long Read,It is an eye opener for those that don't know about Andersonville. It gets a bit long but nothing compared to what the people in Andersville had to go though.
5,I loved this,"It is fascinating and heart-breaking at the same time. You just keep hoping that there will be some escape for all of them, knowing the whole time that there isn't. It is hard to imagine what these men went through, and how their relatives might feel reading this. This isn't for the faint of heart."
5,Enlightening!,Brave men have fought And died in many wars throughout the history of this nation. We who were not present must rely on the accounts of those who were to expand our realm of understanding. In my opinion John McElroy took the ominous task before him with bravery and an eye for detail that leaves the reader with a vivid description of the horrors perpetrated by the south in an evil war which pitted brother against brother. It should be required reading for all who desire to know the real costs of war and the true desires lurking in the hearts of evil men.
1,Andersonville a Story of Rebel Military Prisons,A book that will keep you reading.it's shame we did this to our own people. Very descriptive.Enjoyed reading about our past
4,Andersoncille visited,I visited Andersonville prison twelve years ago. I was dissapointed in the lack of restoration as a historical site. Had I read the book I would have been much better prepared to realize the spiritual and educational value of the Conferate prision site. The horror of the experience of those confined is a crual testomoney of the sad treatment of American young men.
3,Couldn't finish it.,"The book is probabaly a reasonable representation of conditions in this infamous civil war prison, but frankly, I got bored with the story. It must have been tedious in the camp. The book is a bit that way."
3,Well written and understandably one sided,"The language the author uses paints a vivid picture of the suffering endured while in prison, which I enjoyed because it was interesting to me. Although it was written quite well I find it decidedly one-sided and understandably so. Several instances in the book contradict each other according to the author's own account. Sometimes the author goes a rant for an entire chapter about how a particular group of people are low-life and scum of the earth,which I found to be excessive when he could have made the point in a paragraph or two but he goes on and on. Most of the book is written with the same holier-than-thou undertones that is a northerner looking down his nose on the lowly southerner who can't read or write or do simple arithmetic. There are other chapters that linger on as well especially toward the end of the book. I would recommend this book but not to a young reader and with the acknowledgement of the statement above."
5,A Pleasure to Read,"I have always held that the best way, and perhaps the only true way, to understand the Civil War, or the War of the Rebellion as it was always called then, was to read the oral histories and the accounts of prisoners of war, which always are astounding in at least some regards. Andersonville is an example of a book that adds this dimension of understanding of this titanic conflict that shaped the nation. Well worth reading."
2,Disappointing,"I read Crumley's ""The Last Good Kiss,"" and that may have been his last good book. Anybody else may have gotten at least 3 stars but I think Crumley's gotten lazy. Any time Sughrue gets into a fix, he's always able to kick ass and fight his way out. Of course, any 70 year old Korean war vet should be able to take out a 30 year old FBI agent in top shape....sure. Believable. Hey, Crumley. This is supposed to be crime fiction, not fantasy.The author also seems to have a voyeuristic fascination with young women and drugs, in no particular order.Sex and drugs were used to good effect in ""Kiss."" Here, they're just cheap devices to spice up a basically very boring plot.So much more could have been done with the illegal immigrant/white slavery/child abuse story, but that was never explored. Just good ol' Sughrue kickin' ass.....zzzzzzz."
2,Crumley's gone sour,"The Right MadnessI loved earlier Crumley novels such as ""The Last Good Kiss,"" but he seems to have lost the detachment and sense of humor that made his scathing asides entertaining. Now his narrator's world is full of things he loathes and despises; you wonder why he lives there.Meanwhile, the narrator's friends are all super-hip, earthy, lusty and improbably talented. I'm afraid it reads like the sort of story a high-school kid might write in which he fantasizes about running with the cool kids, only in his imaginary high school his cool kid friends are all superheroes."
2,Tough Guy,"I do like Crumley's ""tough guys"" and Sughrue is as tough as they come. But I find many of Crumley's sentences so convoluted I have no idea what they mean. Like many ""tough guy"" writers, he sometimes uses a specialized vocabulary that, apparently, is known to tough guys (although not always to me). This is fine with me and rather adds to the charm of the ""tough guy"" genre. However, when used in conjunction with bad grammatical structure, I sometimes spend several minutes trying to decipher his meaning. Then I give up, feeling I have missed something important."
4,Don't be like CW,"Do not try to read this book if you are under the control of any substances, including a full meal. It requires your utter and complete attention. For various reasons I was forced to read it in fits and starts, mostly late at night. The plot is more like one of CW's nightmares than a linear narrative. But here's the Crumley magic--once in, even if you're totally confused, you can't stop reading. CW's voice remains as unique as the circumstances in which he finds himself and, ironically, even when you're lost within the plot you re-discover that Crumley is the master at rendering a sense of place. He knows the west and the northern plains and here takes you on a trip that would curl the most experienced tour director's locks."
5,This Japanese folktale receives Toriko Ito's warm drawings,"This Japanese folktale receives Toriko Ito's warm drawings as it tells of a little boy named Satsu, whose best friends are a puppy and a fox cub. Good reading skills or parental assistance will aid in this magic story of a boy who disobeys his parents and trades his silver charm for his life, encountering new problems in the process."
3,Don't be discouraged by this video,"I already know basic knitting. I rented this video from the library because I was interested in other ways of casting on, I only know one way, plus I'm left handed. This video is ok, but I think a beginner might get discouraged, please don't, just try other videos out there, and books as well. The lady instructors fingernails are a bit too long so it can be hard to see what she's doing at times, she has a slight nervous accent, the audio is not the best, plus she is working with a very difficult yarn that is not recommended for beginners. Worsted weight yarn is the best yarn to knit with as a beginner, some yarns like the one she is using can split easily causing a mess of frustration. Happy knitting."
4,Stronghold worth every penny,Stronghold is complicated but you will figure it out. It's good if you can read well. The graphics are okay and they are similar to the Baulders Gate game if you have ever seen it. Stronghold is more of a strategy game. It's worth every penny because I find myself wanting to go back and play it for hours. This is a fun game!
3,NOT ALL THAT,"This product is a good sealant but it might be better suited for garden tools than a cast iron surface.It isn't all that slippery as they claim in fact i've found it actualy causes friction.I did a simple test,I polished an area of my tablesaw with a good quality car polish and coated another area with top cote and then felt the difference. WOW the car polish was clearly the winner.I called the factory to see what they recommend using and guess what,? car polish again. This product will do great on tools you use outside or in the rain.It leaves an ugly white coating on anything you spray it on.Car polish is a whole lot cheaper and in my opinion better.It cleans polishes seals and reduces friction far better than top cote.Just do the test I mentioned and you will see for yourself. Now get out there and try it."
1,BEWARE!,"I had just received my new 15"" planer. I degreased it and put on two coats of Top Cote. I also did the tablesaw, jointer, bandsaw and Spindle sander. Imagine my horror when 4 days later my brand new planer had a coating of rust. So did the tablesaw, jointer, bandsaw, and spindle sander. The tools that I did not use Top Cote on did not have any rust (Mortiser, Drill press, etc). This product says it does not stain but it does. It leaves a milky stain behind. False advertising all around. Now I have to figure out how to remove the rust and then I'll use some type of paste wax. I'm calling Bostik tomorrow - wonder how far I will get?"
2,Bostik's Top Cote,"I agree with Bradley Keller's review. I bought this product to treat the top of my table saw. I was shocked to see a milky-white haze appear after application (I went by the directions on the can verbatim). It smells and looks like wax, so I figured I needed to buff or polish the top cote in. I hand buffed my saw top for about an hour and this took care of the white haze. However, it did not leave my surface as slick as I had expected it to. I too will use a simple auto wax from now on."
3,Bostik Top Cote,"Product arrived on time and in good condition. Top Cote is great for making a saw table, etc. slick. I am not impressed with its rust prevention. I live in Florida with high humidity and this product does not protect as well as wax. I doubt that I will purchase it again."
4,Entertaining Read,"I haven't seen the movie, but I read the book after having heard about the ""Lunatic Line"" -- the name given to the railroad from Mombasa to Uganda through Kenya. The book and the movie tell the story of how the construction of a bridge across the Tsavo River was imperiled by incredible attacks by two giant lions who killed 130 workers, and how they were heroically dealt with by the chief bridge builder and a white hunter. All it all, it is a book filled with excitement and awe. Assuming it's all true, it's an incredible story. Now, I gotta go see the movie."
4,Pure Evil!,"This is a sensational thriller which will also make you laugh. Joe has the meanest grandmother in the world whose sole existence in life is to torment him and make his life miserable. After bumping off various adult friends who actually cared about him Granny has plans for the ultimate evil. She convinces Joe's parents to take an overseas trip as she has plans to attend the Golden Granny Awards where she can compete for awards such as making everyone at the post office wait for the longest amount of time, the longest time to get on bus, most difficult shopper, the most unnecessary visits to a doctor and many more. The evil grannys of the world also have a new invention that will make them young again, all they need is the enzymes of a young boy, he will die of course in the process but what do they care, they all hate the young. Joe's granny is happy to make him the ultimate sacrifice."
1,Don't waste your money or time with Farm & Home Supply Center,"I ordered this brush and received a totally different product than what was pictured. The brush received was about as big as my fist, and would have taken a month to wash my RV. I returned the product, but Farm and Home Supply Center would not refund my cost to ship back to them. I am still out $8.70 for shipping it back to Farm & Home Supply Center. So, the brush was not as pictured;and I am out $8.70; emails to the company went unanswered; you make the choice."
2,Slippery,"The material is extremely slippery - my dog could barely stay on the seat. So, unfortunately I can't recommend this product. However, DogLikeNature is a great company to do business with. If you need anything else I'd recommend seeing what they have to offer."
1,Product should not be bought,Installed cover on rear bench seat and after short trip cover was ripped and straps broke off.
1,Yuck,"I expected a bulkhead type wall plate, instead it's a solder type unit, cheaply made. It will go in my junk drawer for now, but really I should just through it away."
4,"Clear, Crisp and Memorable","Being from Adam Wade's hometown of Pittsburgh has perhaps slanted my appreciation for his vocal talent. I remember hearing him on the radio when I was a child. Now when I play his songs on my radio program everyweek,(some 40+ years later) I truly appreciate his talent.The recording is a superb example of a great voice singing memorable songs with terrific arrangements. I truly wish Adam was still singing in the Pittsburgh area. I only regret I've never seen him in a live show, but this recording is the next best thing. Well done Adam and thanks. Mike McGann WJAS 1320AM , Pittsburgh,PA."
4,The Essential Songs,"Aside from singing, Adam Wade had dabbled in acting as well. He also hosted the short-lived mid-70's game show ""Musical Chairs"". The collection has the best of his Coed recordings....Highly recommended!"
3,The Spice Islands Voyage,The Spice Island voyage is parallel story for theauthories sailing experience in the spice islandand of the 1800 century Alfred Wallace.It's a facinating tale of two eras and how sociallyand environmentally the old and new world aremuch the same but changed in many ways. The bookis well written with references to Alfred Wallace'swritten submission to Darwin about the orgin of the species.Evidence is given that Wallace may have been themajor contributor to the general theory that speciesevolved because of the environment.The modern day adventurers build and sail an boatof an old Indonesian design. The voyage follows theroute of Alfred Wallace who sailed the same waters yearsearlier. There is a sad message of environmentaldestruction caused by the need of Indonesians to survive.The book is stimulating and created a want to read moreof Tom Severin booksBrian Tyhy
4,"...it works great, what more could you ask for","This is simple and straight forward. The roller works very well...I will tell you not to let the glue dry on the roller, while it may not stick to the roller it is not easy to get off once it does dry. When you are done take a couple of minutes and rinse off the roller in the sink.The rest of the attachments are a cool idea but the hassle of changing them out makes them less friendly to use than the standard nozzle on a regular carpenter's glue bottle. I love the roller and use it all the time and that makes this item worth having but I wouldn't get excited about the other attachments if I were you."
4,One Handy Tool,"I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this product before purchasing it but I decided to order it to put me over the ""free shipping"" cut-off amount. I have not been disappointed. The various heads allow you to put the glue where you want it very efficiently. The dowel hole heads and pinpoint applicator have been great. Also the roller head is very efficient for large glue-ups as the glue is distributed evenly and results in very minimal squeeze out. The only thing you have to stay on top of is cleaning the heads as soon as you complete the assembly of your project. It is not a big deal and nothing more than running them under some warm water for a few minutes. You're then ready to go for the next project. I keep it in a convenient spot on my workbench and would recommend it, especially if you are looking avoid to paying shipping charges."
4,Good product for the woodworker,Great gift idea for the woodworker in your life. I use it often and got it on sale with free shipping.
4,Useful Tool,"I was building a workbench out of 2X maple and needed to glue about 30 slats together. I bought this tool specifically for the roller attachment, and I couldn't be happier with it. The rest of the tips I haven't even touched, and I think it's probably going to stay that way because for most things using a custom glue tip seems like too much trouble.In summary - buy it for the roller or don't bother buying it at all."
3,Huh,"Sorry bout the boasting. I got a bit carried away. Becky's fine, but... I think Sarah Brightman, even tho she's approaching her old age, she's better than Becky, but she isn't that bad."
1,Woeful,This CD is a must not listen. Becky is the Johnny One Note of the prepubescent popera. Click on Handful of Songs and see if you can listen to it for more than 15 seconds. Save your money and buy Andrea McArdle's Broadway.
1,What Were They Thinking?,"How could EMI allow this? Well, after Ms. Carey maybe I understand. Becky, go back and be a young girl and live a wonderful life and forget this for a few years."
2,I beg to differ...,"I have to agree with another minority reviewer who was puzzled how this author could be favorably compared to LaCarre. LaCarre is so enjoyable in part BECAUSE of his complex, multi-dimensional characters. ""The Last Supper"" by contrast has single-dimensional people. The commies are distasteful....our heroes have unbelievable strengths that seemingly pop out of nowhere. Seemed like every other character knew not two but three or four languages and always with a native's accent. Witty if baseless aphorisms drop from his characters' lips at almost every occasion. I do admit getting intrigued by the twisting plot-line, so did finish the book."
4,East Meets West,"East Indian music with a couple of jazz songs included.""Making Music"" (the first song) is a 12-minute somewhat somber interplay between the four musicians,""Water Girl"" is a percussive worldbeat-type song featuring the tabla,""Toni"" is an ""ECM-jazz"" ballad featuring saxophone (the tone is excellent),""Sunjog"" is rhythmic jazz with each instrument entering in unison,""You and Me"" is an energetic tabla-guitar interplay and a great way to end the album,and ""Sabah"" is another song which leans toward jazz.""Zakir"" has some guitar later joined by some squeeling sax near the end of the song. ""Anisa"" is a 3-minute guitar solo followed by 6 minutes of solo tabla and voice."
4,Chaurasia is GODLY,"Most of the tracks are really, really good....my special words are about 'Sunjog'. It starts with a rather unconventional note from Garbarek...Pardon my ignorance (if any) but I was not able to conclude if it is incorrect mixing or playing or a deliberately inserted 'noise' to make the oncoming note from Chaurasia, nothing but GODLY. I should admit that the first times I listened to it, the start of flute will almost bring a drop of tears in my eyes.Must buy for anybody who wants to try Zakir, John and for anybody who wants to listen to any music of Zakir and John together, but outside of Shakti."
3,A seminal work by Ruth Rendell,"This is one of Ruth Rendell's first suspense/mysteries and while it may not compare to what she writes today, it is still a fascinating glimpse of early Rendell as well as a look into one strata of British society circa 1965. Ruth Rendell has a remarkable talent for characterizing interesting people and than confounding us as she slowly reveals their machinations and hidden agendas. I feel lucky to have found this book @ Amazon.com."
3,Looks familiar... isn't this a Mirari CDM372?,"Sometimes cheapie items can work better than the more expensive ones. I've had nothing but trouble since the day I got my Rio Volt SP150. Its so picky about what CD's it will play, sometimes I have to waste 4 disc just to get one that may work. This player is simple and doesn't have fancy features, but it plays WMA CD's and that's all that really matters to me. My whole music collection is in WMA for space saving reasons. You can fit more 128kbps wma's onto a CDR than you can Mp3's of the same bitrate. This is a functional cd player, now if only it had ID3 text display and a user adjustable EQ."
3,Suitable for helping with a Science Project...,Bubble Gum Science is suitable for helping with a science project. It has some interesting points of view. You get your moneies worth.
3,Washed-out video and mostly older material,"I ordered this to use in class and for my dad, a B-52 navigator for many years. Unfortunately, the video and sound quality left a lot to be desired, and the footage was mostly older Vietnam era material. It looked more like a edited home movie at times than a professional tape. This would be best only for enthusiasts who are willing to overlook the faults of the editors."
5,Great CD !,"Recieved the CD last week and i enjoy every track. Love this album, brings back many memories!"
3,not a good predictor of actual score,"I used this book mainly for the sample tests--but I found that I was scoring about 10 points worse on them than I was on actual, previously used LSATs or ones in other books. I don't think they use practice questions from LSAC, instead making them up (which does lower the price, but still...)"
4,MAN! YOU SHOULDA BEEN THERE!!,"This band was IT in Austin in 90-91. They released two major label records, neither their best. The best was the analog tape only ""Live at the Black Cat"".OutdeBox is the closest of the two Epic releases to what the fans were jammin to, partly because it was originally a Currant release.Here - is a revealing personal ballad from Kevin, great songBill Cassis is one of Texas' undiscovered talents. He is every bit as talented as Ian Moore or Eric Johnson.Kevin's song writing has always been great, but it needs Bill's guitar wizardry edge to make exceptional tunes. I'm glad they are collaborating again. Hopefully one of the music industry clowns walks away from SXSW long enough to catch Soulhat at Heart of Texas, and signs them."
5,Soulhat is Phenomenal,"I recently saw these guys live and was blown away. I went into the show with no expectations and came away a fan. Raw energy, musicianship, and pure entertainment. If not already there, this album will be on your favorite's list. It is one of those rare gems."
1,woefully inaccurate,"My wife took a look at this while working in the corporate sector, before she enlisted in the military. I took a glance through it, and that was enough.I'm sorry, but it doesn't grasp the male viewpoint. Harragan's take on men is naive and stereotypical enough to cause chuckles. As to her notion that the corporate sector is based on military organization...well, Romanian and English are both based on the Latin alphabet, but they aren't even close linguistically. The whole chapter about this assumes that of course no woman has EVER been in the military, and of course all male executives were, and of course young men who've avoided the draft or service (This was written in 1977) are in the same boat as women in that regard. I'm also a veteran and have worked in the private sector.I'm sorry, but no. There is an inequality against women in the corporate world, and I don't know what the fix is, but it's not in here.Highly misleading, badly dated and not recommended."
2,Mediocre First Single Off New Album,"As far as talent goes, I feel that Steps have a lot to offer. After running into their first CD, ""Step One"", at London's Gatwick Airport during the summer of '99, I just knew I had to have the CD. That is when I first got into the Steps sound. Now, over a year later, I still have a great respect for Steps....kind of an ABBA for the new millenium. However, with STOMP, the first single off of their latest album, I am a little bummed. The vocals on this one are excellent, and most of the credit I give the song is due to the singers themselves. However, the actual song itself is a bit boring and barely memorable. It is a re-hashed disco song with very little of anything too interesting. The first couple of times I heard it, I thought it was pretty decent, but now I am sick and tired of it. Not a strong offering from this U.K. bubblegum group."
1,THE AUDIO MASTERS APPARENTLY BURIED w/LINDA ...,"I fell in love with this singer in the '60s-'70s time frame while living in New York. She was way ahead of her time with her ear-piercing, soul-scorching vocals, but once I bought the CD I was in for the shock of my life. The master tapes must have been buried with Linda, because they're not here on disc! This disc is full of snap-crackles-and-pops and reminiscent of LPs found at a flea market! Shame on the producers and engineers attempting to pass worn vinyl off on CD."
4,Under Linda's Spell,"I purchased the Hypnotized CD and I found it to be of pretty good quality considering how old the music is with the exception of one song, ""I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow."" It should not have even been on the cd considering the way it sounds. The song is great but the remastering was just awful. Linda has so much feeling in her music. She was taken from us too soon, but her music lives on forever especially through artists like Teena Marie, whose style is similar and who is a power house in her own right. I have not heard any other artist close to Linda's style but Ms. Teena. These two ladies happen to be from different eras and are my favorite female recording artists. In saying, awaiting better quality cds of this beautiful and talented artist. One Luv"
1,Great Linda Jones music on horrible CD.,"Any fan of 1960s soul knows that Linda Jones was one of the greatest divas of her time and that (sadly) she never attained the success and recognition due her. While she never scored a major pop hit other than ""Hypnotized"" many serious soul fans feel (with some justification) that she was more worthy of the ""Queen Of Soul"" title than Aretha Franklin ever was. Unfortunately this CD (her first-ever U.S. CD compilation) does not do Linda any justice whatsoever because all of these songs were transferred from horrible-sounding, worn-out LPs. This is great music from a great diva that cries out for and is in dire need of better remastering."
3,This is not about Jurassic fishes!,"If you like fossils, don't think you'll find any in this book. This is about Recent fishes that some people, in an old fashioned way of thinking, call ""primitive"". I am not sure if I know exactly why this book has this title. Yet, he's not that bad at all: it has very nice pictures about aruans, sturgeons, bichirs, lungfishes, etc, and if you are an aquarium lover, I guess you will find some interesting informations about care in captivity."
5,great to give to a best friend,"Mailed this to my three best girlfriends randomly as a surprise, with a small card inside just expressing my gratitude for their friendship. It'd be great to include as a bridesmaid gift too. Attaching one to my husband's Valentine's gift too!"
3,cute,"it was alright...cute read, i was ex[ecting a little more after other reviews I had read, a little disappointed, but still cute"
4,book,"a great little book. product fit the description of the seller (slightly used) but was just fine. We used a few passages from the book as a reading at our wedding. ""I like you, because you're a good person to like"" yada, yada :)"
5,A Delightful Find,"My one-year-old daughter just picked this off the bookstore shelf, so I bought it for her. What a wonderful, sweet book! Later that evening I finally sat down and read it and it made me cry! Buy it for anyone you care about. It's just amazing."
5,A book for any age,"I was given this book as a child but it wasn't until I read it as an adult that I realized how special it is. Its perfect as a gift for friends, family, that special someone, or for yourself when you're feeling down. I read it whenever I want to remember how simple life can be or if I need a good laugh. I think it teaches you a lesson to live by: remember to be goofy sometimes and enjoy the silly moments in life with the people you love, I mean really enjoy them, like you would a parade, no matter what day it is!"
4,I LIKE... I Like You,"I like you...who could ask for even a better name for a book. This book, although childish in nature, is the perfect gift or example of any friendship... I Like you cause if I am going to throw up - you don't go and look at the birdies. This book explained friendship to me at the age of sixteen. A friend red it to me... and now I know we are forever bonded... Call me cheesy, but I like you... is a definite fun buy and read and keepsake."
2,Not the best,"Some of the stories are very high quality and fitting the girls that they are about (Addy, Kirsten, Josefina, Felicity). The heroine upholds a good ideal of what a good person should be. Others, it seems, indicate that the author was completely out of ideas (Samantha, Molly). I was a little disappointed in the Kirsten story as it seems incomplete. The collection as a whole is not up to the par of the previous sets."
4,A MUST read for young girls,"There are certain books almost every youg girl will fall in love with, books like Charlotte's Web, Anne of Green Gables, Little House on the Prairie and anything by Judy Blume, and now I wish than when I was young, these books had been available. Wonderful stories with characters that are loveable and comfortable, easy to relate to. This is a series of books that will brighten a child's world, and encourage reading by capturing their attention from the first page."
5,Great American Girl Short Stories,"History, great stories and authentic historical crafts! Not only that, but just the right size for girl-sized hands. A+++++++ Cannot be beat!"
4,Alien Visitor....an older gem of a Movie,"I think this Movie has been overlooked. It has beautiful, varied scenes of Earth. Maybe it is not the most exciting movie, but very thought provoking in an mostly Eco-minded way. A little gem."
1,"worthless, save for the unintended comedy in pretension","I have long been a fan of the best of Australian movies. So when this was recommmended as Aussie sci-fi, I took a chance. What rot. It is little more than a long commercial for radical environmentalists. I say that as one who loves the outdoors and bemoans urban sprawl that destroys wildlife. But both radical environmentalism, which far too often comes very close to hating the human race (oddly enough, except for the most environmentally destructive and least environmentally aware and concerned peoples: such as Marxists and black Africans and Haitians), and bad, boring, self-indulgent movies are revolting."
4,A full featured label maker for home or office,"This unit has a full assortment of bells and whistles, but you can ignore them and use the default/automatic settings and still have great results for many label needs.The unit has a number of preprogrammed formats for such things as file folder labels that help give consistent results.The automatic tape cut off is a nice feature.Be sure to get the AC adapter since battery life, especially when printing large size fonts will be a disappointment. The price of the adapter seems a little high which is why I rate the product 4 rather than 5 stars.The keyboard is easy to use and the process is fast enough that I see no need to have one of the more expensive versions that interfaces to a PC.All in all it has been everything I expected it to be."
4,bcieclipse bounces back with this one,"after ""curse of the dead"" i thought long and hard before i bought this set,but as it turned out this is a much better set than the last one. as always no widescreen and just ok transfers but a great way to build you a collection of b-z grade horror movies."
1,Bad design,I bought this and used it a few times using a cordless drill. It worked OK until the cable came loose on yjr back end (inside the plastic housing.) I tried several times to fix it but finally threw it away.I bought another one made by Rigid that looked similar but did not accept a drill. It was only hand cranked. It is completely useless.
1,Failed on first use,"This product has three feed rollers that control the cable and they are mounted on a plastic sleeve. The first time I tried to clean a drain, the plastic sleeve broke, rendering the tool useless."
4,Ridgid powerspin drain cleaner,"I have used several similar type devices before and don't recommend much, but I would this. The automatic feed and withdrawal is great! It will still bind and bend and twist if gets stuck. It is tougher than most of this size. The hand crank appears weak in attachment, but I cannot get used to and have previously underestimated the strength of modern engineered plastics. I would not recommend using a drill that is more than 500 rpm (just as they recommend). I have an older home that has ceramic drain pipes (I have replace about half with PVC) and have a larger drain cleaner that must be used from the outside. I bought this due to a slowing drain and bad weather. It pulled the small roots out from inside pretty well and got me by until better weather."
1,Doesn't feed well,"I own one, but it works poorly. The feed handle doesn't engage well, which prevents feeding forward or returning. Sometimes it works but you have to squeeze painfully hard on the trigger, which is too small."
1,lousy pictures,The pictures in the book are mostly close up pictures of the flowering plant. Can't see leaf or leaf structure or plant size within a natural environment. Would not recommend this book for plant identification.
5,Florida Native Planting,"The author created an excellent reference book on native Florida plants. It has wonderful photos, descriptions, and suggestions for planting and growing a native garden."
1,Poor quality control,I had high hopes since I have used their DVD-R's previously. The first disc had scratches and was damaged. It was also dirty with many particles present on the surface as well. The next few discs also were dirty. The product was returned to Amazon.
2,Scracthed discs abound,"Received item in securely packaged box and was surprised to find that about half the stack had damaged discs. The outside perimeter (about .25 to .50 inches) of the damaged discs were were noticealby scratched. I just tried burning and reading a test disc (using Nero DVD Speed) and it failed with a read error. Hopefully, the rest of the stack won't be as bad.Don't know who is to blame for the damage: manufacturing or shipping. Hopefully, this was just a bad ""set"", but I'll be buying my discs ""locally"" from now on."
5,Click Here To See How I Survived 7th Grade.,This was a great book.It was about this geeky 12 year old girl named Erin Swift.And her and her best friend Jilly were not on the same track for 7th grade.Well in the end Erin was acually happy that her and Jilly werent on the same track because it came out that Erin finnally learned who she was.And the meaning of Cheery flavored tootsie pops.
4,It helps!,"I'm a 6th-grader and I'm going into 7th. Anyways, I read this book, and it was truly hilarious. I can't believe how true it is! I mean, I've had this stuff happen already in 6th, and I can wait to see what will happen in 7th a.k.a. middle school (since my school goes to 6th). My favorite characters would probably be the janitor and Erin. I read it in the hospital and it was so cool! I really suggest buying this book."
5,read in paperback.,i have this book in phisical form then found it on the store.judt so u know amazing book...will be back*ominous laughter*
3,Enjoyable But Predictable,"I enjoyed reading this story about Erin Swift, who suddenly finds herself entering the seventh grade without her best friend Jilly being in any of her classes. That's bad enough, but when another girl calls Erin ""Jilly's puppet,"" Erin punches that girl in the nose. Not a good way to start off seventh grade. Erin then keeps a computer diary of all her thoughts and feelings about things. She finds herself interacting with students in a new way: a way she wouldn't have interacted with them had Jilly been there. This is an enjoyable read, but also a predictable read."
4,Click Here,"The book (click Here)I read was a very good book. I enjoyed it because of the fact it was about friends that did not get put in the same team and they were heartbroken and the ups and downs of their school year without each other, read more to find out about what it is like with out your best friends.Some parts are boring but over all it is a good book! I was going to stop at the boring parts but I kept reading it and glad that I did."
5,STIFF UPPER LIPS.,THIS MOVIE IS VERY VERY FUNNY. SEAN PERTWEE IS TRIFFIC AS THE COMMIN PESENT BOY. THE WOMAN WHO PLAYS THE HEROWIN IS ALSO GREAT. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. PETER USTNOV IS GOOD AS A OWNER OF A PLAINTION TEA IN INDIA. WATCH THIS MOVIE.
2,Tries not to be Stiff too hard!,"Facing old maid-hood at the ripe age of 22, young and fair Emily (Georgina Cates) is introduced to the black-suited, Latin-spouting bookworm Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal), a friend of her brother Edward (Samuel West). When sparks fail to fly (and Cedric is such a priss you'll wonder if he would rather be with Edward) the matriarch of the family, Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) packs everyone up for a holiday in Italy. Believing that a piece of England should always be with them, they also pack up the lawn and employ local ""scum of the earth"" handyman George (Sean Pertwee) to lug it, and a multitude of luggage, around.Stiff Upper Lips, on the whole, is a funny, but not hysterical, take on English period piece movies. It is slow paced."
3,"""She has warlike swans?""","You've got to hand it to the producers and writers; in living up to the claim that there wasn't a parody of Merchant/Ivory films ""..until now!"" they've picked up the wit, the repressed feelings, overly romanticised locations and the achingly fierce British class war. Now if only they could have done it a little bit better.The cast does a fairly good job, but that only covers so much ground, and the third act of the film suffers when you realise that they've run out of things to spoof.The humour ranges between the urbane and the lewd, but then what are you watching it for? My wife and I laughed quite a bit, and it has a healthy amount of quotable phrases, which says a lot more than some other films out there.All in all, its a cute diversion."
1,45 watt soldering iron/sucker,I am not a fan. The concept is great but the iron must be under powered for the amount of metal it has to heat. I let it heat up and tried it. It never got hot enough to melt the solder. I waited longer for it to heat and still nothing. It kind of worked when I used my other soldering iron with it but not well.I was looking forward to using it but has been no help to me.
5,not bad,this is very good for the money. I use it in Hobby's and work and does a good Job in both for the price.
5,Good Stuff,"I used the original Titebond for a bunch of edge-glued trim. It worked good, but I wanted to have the left over glue usable for exterior applications. I got the Titebond 2, it works great, takes a little longer to cure, but it does dry enough at 70 degrees to take it out of the clamps and finish milling it after 1 hour. I am more comfortable using a water resistant glue for an all-around glue. Cleans up well with a wet rag, sands good, and you can wet sand it (sand the surface while the glue is wet, and the sawdust will make its own wood putty. Works good on seams up to about 1/16"", just make sure that you get ALL the residue off the wood surface.)"
3,Why the Renaissance matters.,"Johnson does a great job of summarizing the Renaissance in a quick 150 pages. The book summarizes the forward thinking which resulted in a revolution in the sculpture, paintings, and buildings of this period. Man was outwardly focused during this time and shows developments in Italy and then in the rest of Europe.The problem that I find with these quick reads of a complex subject is they have so little space to explain the subject and adequately make it interesting. Johnson does a great job in the summary but fails to motivate the reader to other works which expound on the Renaissance.For those who need a quick read on this fascinating time in history, this is a quite capable book. It describes the advancement in literature, sculpture, painting, and building of this period."
5,"Learned, lively, engaging","I loved this book -- it really brought the Renaissance into crisp focus. Just a brilliant refresher course. Sorry to bash other reviews, but the one-star review below is bewildering: the guy slams Paul Johnson for including Dante as a Renaissance writer, when EVERYONE considers Dante an early Renaissance figure! A few may demur, but Johnson is squarely in the mainstream here. This short book is a noble effort, and invaluable."
5,wonderful,"Eminent historian Paul Johnson did a great job with this little book. The information he offers about the Renaissance is...informative...& interesting. He knows so much. His writing in this book anyway is completely readable, flowing from fact to fact. Not a single word misfires."
4,Eye Opening,"This is a book for people who wish to take a critical look at the Bible-especially for those who are believers. The import of an ancient book in our society, its truth in spite of the multiple difficulties of reading the work as fundamental fact becomes clear.Be ready to throw away your simplistic ideas about what the Bible means and what it says. The end result is a powerful read."
2,Wish it offered more,"Another reviewer mentioned that this concordance was the equivalent of the Strongs for the NRSV. I bought a used copy for $30+ only to discover that, unlike the Strongs Concordance, it doesn't provide the Hebrew/Greek word, transliteration, or definitions/synonyms. It does not even provide the Strongs number for each word so that you can cross reference them with a Strongs Concordance. This book only gives the references for every time each word appears in the Bible. I had expected more, both from the other reviews and because I own an NIV concordance by Kohlenberger which has all that information. Why include it all in the NIV concordance, but not in the NRSV? I'm pretty disappointed."
5,Subaru,"Balancer was for a 95 Subaru Legacy, fit perfectly and thanks to Dorman for making the hard to find products they do. Unfortunately the crankshaft was too destroyed from the old balancer problem to save the engine, but thats no fault of this awesome piece."
2,WOULD NOT PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THIS ITEM,If I were to buy a shower/outhouse again I would not pay the extra money for this one. They claim one person can set it up in 5 minutes but in our experience we can't set it up with 2 people in 5 minutes. The sleeves that the poles go through are so tight it is a struggle to get the poles through. There was really nothing about this unit that really impressed me and there are other versions that are only a fraction of the price.
2,Shower tent,"On the positive, a very well made shower tent. The negative is the very difficult assembly. I can assemble my six person tent in half the time. The rod couplers are too big for the tent sleeves making it almost impossible to slide the rods up to the top of the tent. This is even worse when you attempt to remove these rods as you cannot pull them out from the base without binding up each coupler and separating the rod.Had I not used it I would return it."
4,Good makeshift shower in deck,needed a makeshift shower in deck as my wife cannot climb stairs.Quick install and dismantle after each use.Slightly expensive. Would have given 5 stars if under 100 bucks.
2,Faithful but not good,"I've read all Jane Austens works several times. I really was looking forward to watch this video and was bitterly disappointed. Yes, it is faithful to the book, no denying this. But in every other respect it's just BORING. I like all the Jane Austen adaptions, especially the 1995 P&P Version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. This one is so totally the contrast to it, I can't even count all the negative things about it. Well, as I said before, the only good thing is the faithfulness to the novel.Why two stars? Because being faithful to the book is worth the two stars."
2,Very Poor acting and storyline,"This movie is in line with the content of Jane Austen's novel, but not the spirit of it. In one of her other novels Jane says, ""Let others dwell on distastefull subjects, I prefer to be over with them as soon as is prudent."" This movie dwells on the immoral and disgusting behavior of Fanny's suiter, Crawford, instead of Fanny's and Edmund's optimistic spirit that was shown in the book. The acting was on the level of soap-opera quality, and the scenery was not very good either. The movie also withheld the surprise element from the viewer concerning Crawford's attachment to another woman, which is the climax of the book. BAD BAD BAD!!"
4,A Faithful Austen Adaptation,"My wife and I have greatly enjoyed repeated viewings of the BBC Mansfield Park. We are both great Austen fans. We feel it is a very faithful adaptation of the book, and that is one of its real strengths. This is not a modern politicized, feminized, de-Christianized (or romanticized) distortion of Austen's art! No doubt the cinematography is not up to current big-budget Hollywood standards, but I really cannot fault the acting. LeTourzel is excellent, for example, in the crucial scene in which Fanny resists the pressure of Sir Thomas to accept Mr. Crawford. Hepton (Sir Thomas), Burbage (Henry Crawford), Smith-Wood (Mary Crawford) are also excellent, as are the characters of Maria, Julia and Aunt . If you want fast-paced action, this is definitely not the film for you. But most people who really appreciate Austen's book, will also treasure this BBC gem."
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed watching this video. The script is very true to the book. The casting was a little off but if you can get by that the rest was great.
4,Very Nice,"I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but this is not one of my favorite books. I was pleasantly suprised by the movie: it was true to the book, but I actually enjoyed the movie more. The Actress that plays Fannie made her a more appealing character than I remember her being in the book. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to Austen fans."
2,"terrible casts, bad screenplay, bad directing.....","this is the first jane austen's novel that was poorly done into a movie. i could never imagine that bbc would did such a bad job. all the casts are so bad, the screenplay, my god, is so bad that it would take a great deal of patience to watch along and stay in a sitting position. all the casts are so bad, none of them are likable unless you are just like one of them. what a terrible directing and acting. the screenplay, my god, is so bad, i just don't want to get into the details... stay away from this deadbeat and don't waste your lifetime in this pathetic movie, see other versions."
1,The WORST I have EVER seen,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There was absolutely nothing remotely atractive about this, the acting was bad, the costumes were bad. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was true to the book and it is one of my favorite Austen novels. At first I thought I was watching Night of the Living Dead that is how bad the acting was, but then I realized that the zombies on the screen were wearing the wrong costumes!!! If I never have to sit through Fanny moping about the house looking like a deer caught in headlights,it will be too soon. I'm real sorry I bought this movie before seeing it, but who knew you could go wrong with a Jane Austin movie! My copy of the movie is now where it deserves to be, hidden behind my row of favorite movies; Pride & Prejudice (A&E version), Sense and Sensebility, and Emma (A&E version)"
4,Are we watching the same movie?,"I have read all the reviews and I just can't believe what people have written. This was a great movie. Yes it had terrible cinematography and the clothing was not that eye-catching but it was extremely well-written and I found the acting more than tolerable. I didn't have a problem with Sylvestra's portrayal of Fanny. I thought she did a good job even if she was not handsome. Fanny was not supposed to be a great beauty. I love the actor who played Edmund. He made me fall head over heels in love with the character. I think the storyline adhered well to the book. I also liked the portrayals of Fanny's uncle and Mary Crawford even though I despised the character. The ending I will admit was disappointing. After a long movie it was not enough of a payoff. Otherwise, this is highly recommended."
1,Jane Austin must be spinning in her grave.,"This movie is a grotesque display of horrendous acting in its purest form. The actress portraying Fanny repulsed me. Someone should have informed her that she was playing the heroine in one of the greatest novels of all time, not some harpie on daytime television. Save your money, as I wish I had, and rent Sense and Sensibility."
1,2nd Disc didn't work,The first DVD worked fine... but the second we couldn't get to work. We tried it on several different DVD machines in the house. But never could get it to work.
3,Worth the watch,"Although this wasn't as well done as the A&E versions and other productions of the Jane Austen books. I thought it was a good story and you learn to like the characters more as the movie progresses. I thought it was worth the watch, but would love to see this one remade."
3,We Need a Remake! But this will do for now.,"Unfortunately, Fanny Brice in this movie looks like an old, worn out shoe. And if you can get past that for several hours, you will delight in Austen's fascinating whirl of characters and their touching moral character. I believe the BBC did credit to Austen's work in this, but Fanny needs to be a bit prettier. After all, she seduces the rogue, Henry,(yes, by her dislike and not looks!)but his eye would never be attracted to an ugly stick. This rendition clearly needs a remake, but it is worth the time and money invested in seeing this one until that time comes."
4,One of my favorites,"Overall I liked this version of Mansfield Park very much with the following exceptions: There were a couple of scenes I did not like, nor how the role of Lady Bertram was played out, nor specifically Fanny's crying scene."
5,Read reviews before you order,"Since I am a huge Jane Austen fan, I didn't want a dvd version that wasn't true to the story. I read several reviews and chose the dvd that the most people liked best. I wasn't disappointed and really enjoyed this version of MANSFIELD PARK. Thank you."
5,The Best Available Adaption,"Most reviews have covered the bases - this to me is the most faithful to the book, altho slow (like the book). Other adaptions either cut too much out or took too many liberties.If the viewer has read the book, she or he will appreciate the faithfulness of the characters, story and acting. If not, the story may seem boring and dragging, but the book itself read that way, at least the first time around.I highly commend this version above all others. It taught me to appreciate the book and read it anew."
2,True to text but hard to watch,"I would have to agree with the former posts that this movie is boring, also that a new adaptation that is true to the text AND has heart is in order. The scene where Fanny is crying in the schoolroom while Sir Thomas interogates her is tortuous. Fannys sobs are forced and go ON and ON and ON.... arrrg!Sir Thomas and Aunt Norris are played well. Miss Crawford is played with spirit but doesn't look the part, whith a different hairstyle I think she could have pulled Fanny off with more success. The others are pretty wooden performances.While the newer Mansfield Park is more entertaining, it is soooo loosely based on the book it doesn't deserve the name!Rent this one from the library while you wait for the REAL one to be made. (We can only hope it is soon!)"
3,A bit disappointing,"Very disappointed in the quality of the product. Bad lighting, some of the costumes were really bad, and even some of the acting. This is an excelent story that has yet to be as well done, as has P&P, or S&S. I give it 3 stars because it does seem to follow the book really well. I expected so much better from a BBC version."
2,Unbearable!,"This movie does stay true to the book in the events that happen, but I find this irrelevent when the lead actress is so bad that it completely ruins the character and story for me."
3,We Need a Remake! But this will do for now.,"Unfortunately, Fanny Price in this movie looks like an old, worn out shoe. And if you can get past that for several hours, you will delight in Austen's fascinating whirl of characters and their touching moral character. I believe the BBC did credit to Austen's work in this, but Fanny needs to be a bit prettier. After all, she seduces the rogue, Henry,(yes, by her dislike and not looks!)but his eye would never be attracted to an ugly stick. This rendition clearly needs a remake, but it is worth the time and money invested in seeing this one until that time comes."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I am an avid Jane Austin fan and found this to be one of the worst portrayals of her work. I couldn't even watch the entire movie, because the acting was so horrible. Don't waste your time or money. Try Persuassion or Pride and Prejudice, they are worth owning."
1,Disappointing in light of good material,"None of the characters, especially the main, seemed likable enough to care about what happens to them. Fanny was certainly in possession of a good character and strong moral compass, but seemed dim-witted (though sweet). You never get the feeling she's in love with Edmund, nor he with her. I was disappointed overall with the entire performance."
3,"Great version, not so great sound...","I love this book, and was overall pleased with this rendition of it. My only fault is the camera operation & the sound. There are times when the camera is shakey for a little bit, and the voices hard to hear. But if you can get over that, and also the fact that the actors are not glamorously beautiful, then you will either really like, or even love this version!"
5,Special Chopin...,".Vasary plays a Boesendorfer Grand Salle which has a wonderful timbre quite different from the Steinway.Vasary's timing and articulation are simply superb: he has a real insight into Chopin's ethos and telos: he renders the inner voicing exquisitely. Vasary's realizations suggest to me what Glenn Gould's Chopin might have sounded like had he played the Nocturnes, Ballades, Waltzes, etc.The sound is crystal clear; the set a bargan price.."
5,Rewarding,"I've loved these performances for a long time, and was delighted to see DG re-release them in a budget box. These are really ""salon"" performances, and I mean that in the best sense of the word. You won't find Pollini-pounding or Zimmermann-zapping here; what you will find is superb technique in the service of impressive interpretations. Highly recommended."
1,Unbelievable piece of JUNK!!!,"I received this and immediately found that the wireless mic section had very low output, not much above speaking volume and thus useless. I plugged in a mic to test the wired section which worked okay, not super-loud but sufficient for my purposes. I thought maybe it needed a charge but found that, when plugged in, the LED charging light never came on. I called Pyle in Brooklyn and they said I could return it at my cost and they'd take a look. I then contacted Amazon and was pleased to see that they would pay for its return and send me a replacement. But when I got ready to re-pack it I found that the mic cord I'd plugged in could not be removed from the jack--somehow locked in! I call Pyle and they were of no help at all, so I'm now sending back this unit (with my mic cord still plugged into it) for a REFUND. I sure hope someone at Amazon returns my mic cord as I requested..."
5,Wonderful Debut!!,"I was very impressed with the CD as this was before his prominence as Smooth Jazz's finest music composer. ""Sunset Island"" & his rendition of the Vince Guaraldi classic, ""Linus & Lucy"" were his best work on the CD. He gets plenty of help from Saxophonist Ernie Watts. Good luck finding this CD as it's been long been out of print."
4,Hand-Made Treasure,"This and other products from Eagle Emporium are little gems. They are simple, light-weight for wrought-iron, and very reasonably priced nice pieces. Delightful to find a good product not ""Made in China""."
4,cute hooks,These hooks are really cute and a good price. My only complaint is they didn't come with hardware which is clearly stated in the description
3,Let This One Into Your Heart!!!,"I began listening to Sam Riney back in the late 80's or early 90's. Poor Sam has never received the recognition that he deserves. He is an excellent sax player and even produced this CD. I like to try and review CD's while I am listening to them. And that's what I am doing now!!! The opening selection Let Me Into Your Heart is one of my favorite songs by him. Clearly it is the best song on this CD. The next 3 tracks are good as well. I could have done without the remake of Breaking Up Is Hard To Do...I don't even like Neil Sedaka's version. We Were Made For Each Other is an okay song, but overall the beginning of this CD is better than the ending. Let This One Into Your Heart if you like up tempo and smooth jazz styles!"
5,The Elusive Door,"I was touched by The Doorman. A tale in which the doorman, a Cuban exile, tries to enlighten the eccentric tenants of a Manhattan high-rise. Though Juan has reached freedom in America he has not gained acceptance and has also left behind the friendship of those he shared his suffering with. The tenants, lost in their mostly hilarious excesses are completely blind to Juan's efforts and their own cruelty. Juan ultimately interacts with the tenant's strange pets with interesting results. I keep picking the book up to read some favorite pages I have marked and consider it a book to read again."
4,Good filter,"I have an F-350 4x4 with the 4R100 transmission. This filter looks like good quality and fitment was correct. The reusable gasket on my pan was still in good shape, so I did not use the one provided with the filter."
5,Dremel does it again!,"I still have my 10-year-old Dremel tool but I wanted this one because it goes up to 35,000 rpm. And is it sweet! I like the soft grip body because it is more comfortable to hold and doesn't slip when my hands get sweaty. The faster speeds make the cuts smoother when I use the routing bits.I also like the way Dremel keeps coming out with new bits to keep the tool versatile."
5,Christmas dream,"I mentioned to my mother ONCE that I wanted this...and so I was stunned when I got it for Christmas! I use it for everything from clockmaking, to cleaning and refinishing antique jewellery and the like. Everything... literally everything. There are so many more attachments to get!... The ""flex shaft"" is a necessity for me, at least. So I reccommend buying this ""super kit"" which comes with that flex shaft. ..."
2,Variable Speed Switch cause of Malfunction,"This Dremel was great when it worked. I had the same problems that I see many others have had. The variable speed switch was not designed well and the tool is rendered useless after a few weeks of light usage. The tool was sent in for warranty repair 2 weeks ago, still waiting."
2,Hard to read,"The print is way too small, makes it difficult to read. Other than that it's great story told by great author."
1,Too Much Vibrato Makes It Cheap Melo-drama Interludes,"I wish I could give it 5 stars. I cannot,though. And no sorry here. I usually likes his performance. He deserves one this time. There is hefty strain on the melody line. Nothing falls near spontaneous or natural. He plays as if he is obliged to deliberately show off. Ave Maria is too bad in particular. I have never heard it played with so much vibrato as it is here. Ave Maria here is not the Ave Maria from Schubert. It sounds like from third-grade soap opera that you happen to encounter when turning the channels on TV. If that is the way you love it played on Ave Maria, then this disk is for you. Because music appreciation is very subjective. I am now hesitant between discarding it,keeping it, and giving it away."
5,WOW!!!!,"I have always been a big fan of vengerov's playing, but he has really outdone himself with this recording. It really has to be heard to be believed. Buy it now, buy it now!! you wont regret it!!!"
4,Is it Really Fiction?,"Is it really paranoia when they are out to get you? Those who ignored the message in the first publication should make it required reading now, as should anyone conducting business on the Internet today.The story line in Pearl Habor Dot Com is totally credible, much like the authors credentials. Understand too that Wynn has been there, done that, and, well, given away the T-shirts! The energy and passion that he demonstrates in his everyday life as a Security Evangelist is certainly revealed within the pages of this exciting story. I looked forward to picking it up every evening and wonder still how fictional these characters really are.Wynn, time to pick up the pen again!"
5,PsyOps Instructor,"This book is, in every way, a winner. It is not only a gripping read and great fun, but it is a truly well-written scenario for an information warfare attack against the U.S. Economy.Several years ago, in his bestselling novel Debt of Honor, Tom Clancy scratched the surface of economic information warfare. In Pearl Harbor.com, Winn Schwartau takes the reader through a weeks-long attack against the national information infrastructure.However, the book is not only a thirller. It is throught-provoking in a number of ways, exploring the true psyche of the hacker community; the dependance that Western Civilization now has on Computers; and the spectre of ""what if we had to live without it.""This book is must-reading for anyone who has anything to do with information security, homeland defense, or economic security.Schwartau's latest book is not only a thriller, but is a wake-up call that clearly shows the dangers of ignoring our critical information systems."
2,"Oh no another non-technical computer ""cyberthriller""","I borrowed my friends copy of this book, and I'm glad I did because it's not worth the 9 bucks. There is a reason that none of the pages are available for preview... if they were you wouldn't buy this book. If you look at the past reviews they are all by ""normal people"" and not ""computer geeks"". This is simply because these books are non-technical cyberbabble with no basis on reality. If you want a book that resonates with the quality of the movie ""The Net"" or ""Fear dot com"" then spend the nine bucks and jump on the bandwagon for some cyberposing. You're better off waiting until it comes out as a movie on lifetime... but hopefully that wont be in OUR lifetime."
4,Microsoft MVP 2005 - Visual C# recommended,"There are numerous upgrades between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0. Thankfully, this book focuses strictly on ADO.NET and how System.Xml is utilized with it. Not only do you learn about new capabilities, the authors do a good job of comparing new techniques/capabilities with those from .NET 1.1.You'll want to carefully review the more simplistic methods for asynchronous database calls, XPathNavigator, and notifications. .NET 2.0 is providing you with better and faster ways to work with data. You need to start getting familiar with them prior to the gold release this fall."
1,OUT DATED!!,"It was cheap because it is an old edition and out of date for I'm sure most any class. I didn't pay attention to rev level, first book back to grad school, was just looking for a deal. Use for reference only, it does have some different treatments to some topics."
5,A very cool blend of international beat with mantra,"This quickly became my favorite CD. It is upbeat AND soothing. I bought two so that I could keep one in my car CD player and still have one for home. Each track starts with a short explanation of the sound (mantra), and then blends into a very hip, international sound with the mantra in full form. Everyone I have played this for has REALLY liked it - even my 9 year old niece - and she's a tough critic! But she's right - it really is fantastic!"
5,Fun and Unusual Combo of Mantra & Techno Beat,"I stumbled upon a number of cuts from the ""Dancing with Siva"" CD in the free music download section of Amazon and was immediately intrigued by the combination of mantra with an edgy world/techno sound. This isn't your typical soft, soothing, chanting CD - and that's what I love about it. At first, I fell in love with ""Triumbakum"" and ""Sharaba"", but after a few plays, I can't really say I have one favorite in particular. ""Vasi"", ""Saravanabavaya"", ""Kleem"", ""Sharaba""... Who can choose?! They're all great. To me, the music itself is hypnotic and engaging; so if you're not a fan of mantra music, the mantras seem almost secondary. If you want a musical style comparison, one could sort of be made to Bhagavan Das' ""Now""."
4,First Purchase From Amazon,"The book I received is pretty good. It's worn, definitely used, but it will do the job. I would definitely buy more books from the seller I bought this from; they wasted no time in sending it out, and they were realistic about the condition."
4,"Strong, But You've Got to Work Fast","This glue seems to be a staple amongst professional woodworkers. I like the bottle design, which squirts the glue in a more controlled fashion and is easier to clean. Here is my summary of pluses and minuses:1. This glue is very strong.2. The glue sets very quickly, so you have less working time.3. If you get a lot of squeeze-out, it's difficult to clean the glue off the wood. Heavy sanding is necessary to remove traces of the glue.But if you are careful, this glue pays off."
1,This stuff kills!!,"Please do not buy this product either on Amazon or in pet stores! It is responsible for killing two of my rodents. I found my hamster dead of an infection because the red fibers got wrapped tightly around his leg/foot. His foot was black and necrotic and smelly so I'm sure that was his cause of death. A similar instance happened to my pet mouse just days afterwards. PLEASE do not put your small animal at risk by buying this product! It is poorly made, dangerous and should not be on the market."
3,Ok but the package is very small,"This product is ok. My dwarf hamsters liked it a lot, but the package is very small and will only last one to two weeks. There are much cheaper ways to get soft bedding for a hamster or gerbil."
4,Good book seller,"This is a used book, quite old, but in good shape. It is as it was represented by the seller and it arrived quickly, and well packaged."
3,Nothing new,"This book comes across as another scholarly work simply complaining about the Supreme Court. He seems upset that the Supreme Court often decides winners and losers rather than focusing on equality and pushing conflict into the legislative arena. However, aren't courts supposed to decide winners and losers in cases? Would citizens really support a court that simply refused to at least attempt to settle controversies. Looking at just Brown v. Board or Roe v. Wade isn't very informative because those ""big"" cases really only constitute a tiny fraction of the Supreme Court's - much less the entire judiciary's - workload. I suspect Burt's analysis doesn't extend very far beyond these ""hot"" constitutional cases."
5,Not only for cereal,"I use this product to make veggie burgers and a sweet potato/chick pea salad, both are low fat with good plant based proteins. Since recipes include spices they are both quite tasty."
1,not what I expected,"It's a book that tells you what you have to do after you die. It's a preparation guide for the last trip. Most of what she writes is not from her near death experience, but from a mix of other sources on what you meet after death. I was very disappointed."
5,"Brilliant, complex, ""listening-to"" electronic","The most musical electronic group I have ever heard. I have long searched for other artists with this level of complexity in their beats, melodies, and everything all around.Difficult to classify - sort of trance, sort of breakbeat, very melodic"
4,Joseph should do more,I really liked this soundtrack. LoDuca takes you on a musical journaey throughout the film. All you have to do is turn on your stereo and close your eyes and listen and let Joeph LoDuca do the rest. The music is fast and at times slow. This is a really great buy!
4,Excellent... but not quite fully original.....,"I too, greatly enjoy this Soundtrack... it is really... uh... ""killer"" ...I realized right away, however that at least 3 of the ""songs"" on it are very similar to some of the Indiana Jones Trilogy Soundtracks...I say BUY it... It'll be worth it!!!"
3,OK But where's the lines?,This soundtrack is ok but not what I expected. Yeah all the music is there and it is GREAT but where are some lines from the movies? A movie like this with so many excellent one-liners deserves to have them on the disc Pulp-Fiction-style. That soundtrack had a good mix of lines/music. THAT is what a sountrack should be. Period.
1,Another Low Budget Music Production,"LoDuca's commercial music productions always have evidence of being made in haste with low budget. We can inderstand that music, as just background, is not the main thing audience are caring about. (they are watching more than listening!!) LoDuca is lucky that his mediocre music could be assocaited with movies and people want to hear because they love the movies. Then, what is the meaning of being a composer?"
4,Muy Bueno es Army of Darkness,"Army of Darkness is such a funny movie...this score (soundtrack)gives it that extra...something. Joseph LoDuca and Danny Elfman have such contrasting styles, you can tell instantly which tune is ""March of the Dead"" I love this soundtrack, and this is a must for anyone who is a lover of fine soundtracks."
4,Hail to the king baby,"if u are a fan of classical music or soundtracks, you must buy this one.... excelent tracks such as building the deathcoaster and gimme some sugar baby will make you go back again to the magic of the evil dead trilogy..."
5,bloom me away!,"It's difficult to believe that this is the dirty, disgusting, punks who are so bad on stage that they make their selves spontaneously puke. Black Lips demonstrate in Let it Bloom that they are actually musicians; they have shown in this CD how they have matured in writing and producing music. Their sound is original, yet eerily familiar. When they get their act together, Black Lips can produce great stuff. Let's hope they choose to keep it up."
2,Left us HANGING in a bad way!,"This has 4 movies on 2 disks. Miss Congeniality and Miss Congeniality 2 were funny and the disks worked perfectly.My husband and I were watching Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. We were enjoying the movie, and half way through, the disk totally messed up (sound and video) and would not forward to any other scenes. To this day, we still do not know how the movie continued and ended. A week later we put in Two Weeks Notice. We were enjoying this movie, too, and half way through the movie, again, the disk did the SAME thing as the other movie. My husband had to rush out to Blockbuster before they closed to rent this movie so we could see the rest of the movie and the ending! Disappointed that a brand new (not used/not previously owned) disk would do this, and leave us HANGING!"
4,Love all movies on this DVD,no sooner did i order this product that i received it in the post. These are some of my favorite movies
5,sandra bullock 4 movies (why not),"have not viewed this collection yet.but going by previous times SANDRA always gave a good performance my favorites speed,miss congeniality.divine secretslake house.premonition.so what ever she throws at us fans we'll take the cuz"
1,Low Quality DVDs,"I love these movies, but the DVD's keep getting stuck and skipping. It seems like a good deal, but not if they don't work."
4,Bullock Comedy Collection,"This collection has very good movies, I love Bullock. The only down side with this set is that the DVD's aren't labeled so you don't know which movie you are putting in."
5,What a great account of Bali!,"Having just returned from my first visit to Bali, I have been anxious to read more about the people, culture, traditions, and religion. This book is an excellent recounting of one couple's experience living with a Balinese family. It was almost like getting to return to Bali for another visit. The writing is clear, concise, and illuminating. I truly enjoyed this book."
2,A Little Bit One Oclock,"I found the book plodding, boring and the writer self absorbed. It didn't capture mystical island of Bali."
4,I bought this for Tanktics,"We first found Tanktics sort of by accident at a local computer store, it was on the clearance shelf and clearance priced.Tanktics is an old game, but my wife and I find it a lot of fun.It definitely ""adds miles"" to your mousing (you have to mouse a LOT), but we like the game's quirky sense of humor - you command a bunch of tanks and employ sheep to power your part production. Haven't tried the other games in the collection - getting Tanktics was my only goal."
4,works in our condo mailbox,"fit perfectly. Came with several different sizes, so it will most likely work for you. smooth action. keys are standard small mail-key size. happy with purchase"
2,My opinion,"This is a good tool for the average home owner, and it does have some good features. It needs to be a little more heavy duty for serious tree work though, bigger rope for pulling,and heaveyer pulleys. Does cut good."
4,Dunlop 426 P Triangle Picks,Items arrived quickly. Picks are good for mandolin. I prefer to use Dunlop Ultex regular size 1.0 for guitar playing.
3,Average Product,"The dictionary itself is good. However, the recording sounds like she is still learning how to pronounce the words. More clear and American accent is necessary."
4,Electronic dictionary,The Franklin speaking dictionary i purchased was in mint condition and delivered on schedule. I am happy with my purchase and it serves it's purpose. The only issue I have is the speaking voice coming out from the speaker is not very clear. Perhaps in the future the audio sound and clarity of the speaker can be improved but overall I am satisfied with the service and product
1,Franklin SCD-1890 electronic dictionary,This unit was very difficult to read; font was too small and could be obliterated by glare from ambient light. Background lighting would be a big improvement. Fortunately the seller allowed me to return the unit.
3,Speaking Dictionary,"For the buck you pay, this speaking dictionary seems reasonable.This has Thesaurus, Dictionary, Grammar and Word builder games etc.Calculator, unit conversion and clock function are extra nice features.This is little bulky to carry. Sound is not of very good quality.I did not like the pronunciation generated on this dictionary, not that much clear. I wish I had bought non speaking dictionary with nice phonetic symbols for pronunciation instead of faulty speaking system. Anyway if you don't care about speaking function, this is a good dictionary for its price."
4,Speaking dictionary,"This is a great product except for the ""speaking"" feature. While the rest of the features continue to work with full power after a few applications the speaker gets weak and then disappears altogether. I would recommend a glare free screen as well. It has to be viewed from various angles at times under different lighting conditions. It has numerous features and overall is a good design."
5,Franklin SCD-1890 and the 2100,"This is my fourth Franklin dictionary and I`ve retired the first one. I gave my oldest daughter the second one , my youngest daughter the third one (SCD 1890) and I kept the fourth one (SCD 2100)which has more definitions ,antonyms and synonyms. I needed the one with the most info because I read for the blind occasionally on WLRN Radio Reading Service.These are excellent tools and I wish they were around fifty years ago. 5 Stars+."
2,Basic Thrills,"Years ago, when I was in college. I purchased a Franklin Language Master LM4000. It was the greatest. It lasted about 20 years. It was far superior to this new model and less pricy. I'm not impressed with this model at all, but it will have to do until they make another that will satisfy my needs like in the days gone by."
3,Could Sound Better,"Franklin SCD-1890 Speaking Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th EditionThis product is wonderful but could be better if speaking could be more pronounced and understood especially when using tool for Spelling Bee. The mechanical sound distorts the word."
3,my_view,"This is a fairly decent electronic dictionary that I've found useful.It isn't exactly compact, but small enough to be carried around.The lcd of this device can be easily scratched. I've once put this is inmy bag and rode my bicycle. Once I got to my destination and took outelec. dic. I noticed that the lcd part was some what scratched, a case would of been nice. Overall I find that this device does what it's suppose to."
3,Needs tweaking,"This device has the potential to be great. That being said it needs some help. The backlight on the LCD is very poor and makes it hard to read. This coupled with a small font really creates problems unless you're using it outside. The speaker isn't very good and has too much static. It is an awesome reference tool. It has so many books and translators and that almost makes it worth the money. If it just didn't look, feel and sound so ""cheap"" it would be great. For the price it should have a carrying case at least."
3,Needs a face lift,I would like to start off with it meet the basic requirements I was looking for in a handheld. The features are very simple to use and extremely user friendly but my issue is the lack of color on the screen. Compared to my other handheld devices It rates a 1 out of 10.
4,Good area of application with little under execution,"The Franklin SCD-1890 Speaking Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary is very convenient to have at hand and serves the purpose 70%. The drawbacks come to mind first - very slow, uneasy typing mechanism and poor graphical interfaces. Also the number of words one can store is mere 40, which I found to be insufficient. Plastic is also cheap and does not look good. But nothing else is available and hence needed to buy it and mostly serves the purpose. Has been a really handy tool of looking up words at home."
4,Good buy,Bought this and it turned out really good. Was a lot of functionality at really cool price. The reading aloud feature also worked well for the dictionary.
1,Franklyn 1890 Dictionary not received,I ordered a Franklyn-1890 Electronic Dictionary on 8-20-2008 that was in srock and to be shipped on 8-22-08. It has not arrived.I sent an email to m-kat@rambler.ru on 9-13-08 but no reply. It was not rejected.Very deceitful service.Charles Kirk
5,works for me,"Good value for the money. No problems with any of the features. Cheap enough that you won't mind if it becomes obsolete or gets destroyed in a move, as so often happens."
5,Ideal for students and the non-specialist general reader.,"Archaeology has conclusively documented through the discovery of fossil remains of early humans that Africa is the cradle of homosapiens. Human Beginnings In South Africa: Uncovering The Secrets Of The Stone Age surveys 150 years of archaeological research that depicts the progress of paleolithic and neolithic humans, piecing together the evidence showing that the roots of South African society stretch back into the very beginnings of the stone age. Highly recommended for students of archaeology as well as non-specialist general readers with an interest in human origins, Human Beginnings In South Africa presents an up-to-date text that is enhanced with black and white photography, maps and diagrams."
5,Memories which must be kept 'real',"This book is already a treasure and one I can love and then bequeath to another art and tradition and people lover...At the end of October in 2003, I was in Milwaukee to see this Quilt exhibition. Friends of Art from Indiana University drove to Chicago and then on to the marvelous museum in Milwaukee to experience the Quilts. What an awakening! That day I bought a Video. Since that time I have purchased the DVD and (when I found it online) the hardback book The Quilts of Gee's Bend! What a treasure! I am overjoyed to have this book and to have had the viewing experience! [I also use the USPS stamps and the book of postcards!] --Sarah K. Robinson"
5,great collection of American Art,"I am an Alabama native. I have visited Gee's Bend, Alabama many times, but mainly to EAT!! They have more than pretty quilts in Gee's Bend. I have seen the quilts but because I love quilts and even tried unsuccessully to make one but, not being an expert, I guess I did not appreciate how popular the Gee's Bend quilts would become until I saw the story on CBS's Sunday Morning about the quilts being on display at the Whitney Museum in New York. The current quilters visited the opening at the museum and song those old gospel songs to their many fans.The book itself is filled with stories and lovely photographs of the quilts. All the quilts are hand-stitched, of course. I couldn't imagine anyone creating such beauty with a needle and thread.I am so happy I pre-ordered the book from Amazon. It will be a prized part of my collection."
1,The True Beginnings of Modern Art,"I was fortunate enough to see the Gee's Bends quilts when they toured in Houston, and they are astonishingly beautiful. The women who made these quilts found an artistic outlet in their functional craft, and these quilts represent the truest form of modern art, sewn well before painters used oil and canvas that mimic the quilt designs. This book does a beautiful job of presenting the quilts for the enjoyment of all those who can't see them in person."
3,More like E-Commerce with bCentral,"In and of itself, this isn't a bad book. It's very informative and I would have to say that it's bound to be extremely helpful for beginners. I only THOUGHT I needed more help with FrontPage. When I started looking through here, I realized that I was already chapters ahead. The only problem is that it's not really about ""e-commerce"" in the broadest sense of the word -- It's about e-commerce using bCentral. If you weren't planning to sign up for bCentral, the other Teach Yourself Visually book by the same author will probably teach you just as much."
2,very disappointing,"Implausible stupid plot, predictable boring characters.For the most part I like reading Eileen Wilks' urban fantasy series and I have a certain tolerance for fluffy romances if the story is well written and has humor, so I took a chance and purchased ""Expecting and In Danger"". The title tells you all you need to know about the plot. I got about 2 chapters into it and I had to put it down. The whole set up for the plot is ridiculous and the principle characters are angry, clueless & lame. It did not hold my attention at all."
3,smells great just not right for me,THIS IS A GREAT SMELLING LOTION AND MAKE YOU FELL SOFT BUT IT WAS JUST NOT THE KIND I NEEDED
4,"Smells nice, does the job",This smells nice and helps the tan without being overly bronzing or fake looking. I bought this in October and tan every week and I still have a lot left.
5,absolutely spectacular,"this book is a great picture of poetry by one of america's best living poets. funny, touching, and above all, poetic, strand's new book is definitely worthwhile to anyone interested in poetry."
2,Book not as great I had hoped.,"This book was highly recommended to me, but I thought it was pretty low-level, eclectic, impressionistic, juvenile, an over-all dissappointing. If you're looking for something like Aristotle's Poetics, you will be dissappointed too. If you like a patchwork quilt of emotive, faux elitery, then you will find your reflection in this book."
5,The Rhinemann Exchange,"The DVD was 4 hours of factual information. My husband, a disabled veteran of WWII, and I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. The story starts out in 1939 and leads up to the start of WWII and continues on from there. My husband plans to watch it again in the event he missed something the first time."
2,Robert Ludlum would be disappointed,The series has a good plot but is poorly acted by one and all.Robert Ludlum's book is much better to read than sitting through this poor attempt to bring his written words to life.
1,The Rhineman Exchange DVD,"Ipurchased this dvd on dec. 21,2011 for 5.75. My account was charged 17.00. please correct this mistake. Purchased from Amazon."
1,Weaksauce,"A lot of over (or under) acting. Director doesn't make you 'believe' that the main character really is a secret agent. Mainly about a guy that sleeps around with all the women he can find. He's like a male prostitute but without the money. You hear that he sleeps with a married woman. Rather disgusting to see a producer/writer that would allow that in a film with his name on it; disgraceful for my money. In all, the movie seems like one that the producer didn't put a lot of time and thoughtfulness in to. More like he was lazy and figured the Americans apetite with 'sex sells' would get the movie watched."
4,Consistentsy with flair,I like this cd as much as their last. Different but with the same style and flair. Not a dissappointment
3,damn good music!,"actually got to see these guys live on new years eve, nyc, 2006.""Talk To LaBOMB"" is a great new album. smart, sexy, angry and totally different to their first offering ""Brazilian Girls"" which was still different, but soft round the edges and melodic with great words. this one is protest, it's hard, sometimes fast and rude but bloody entertaining!listen to ""sexy a**hole"" and tell me you don't like it? weirdo!"
5,Awesome,I fixed a small wooden table that I use in my classroom with this glue. This glue is holding tight.
2,Super runny and weak,So much oozed out of the joint I was gluing that maybe there was nothing left. It only held a chair arm in place for a couple of days.
4,"Gosh, I enjoyed this book","I grew up reading the works of Ditmars and Kauffield (sp?), dreaming of the day when I could visit some of the places they went to, and do some of the things they did. This book managed to capture some of the same feeling of wonder and yearning that I experienced all those years ago. Unlike those books, this book gives a good general overview of snake biology and evolution, and the photos are so beautiful that they brought tears to my eyes. Dr. Greene's anecdotes and writing style bring the subject wonderfully to life."
5,Very Informative,A well put view into the world of the serpent. It lays it out so even us laymans can understand it.
5,Five stars for the original...just buy that.,"The original ""Darkman"" is one of the best,and underrated films of all time.Liam Neeson shines as the main character,playing Darkman.Unfortunatly,the other two films just flat out suck.Not only because Neeson isn't playing Darkman in them...okay that is the main reason.But still,overall the other two films just don't have the same feel to them as the original had.Maybe it's because of Neeson not being present in them.Bottom line,the original is the best and only good one in the trilogy,and I would recommend just picking up that,and not even wasting your time with the the sequels."
4,beggars can't be choosers,Parts two and three not so great.Three was primarily a vehicle for Fahey and the drama was somewhat forced.
1,It Was Good While It Lasted -- That's What She Said,This broke about 3 weeks after I got it. What a disappointment ... that's what she said.
1,lousy,Batteries didn't work when it arrived and it's not even the real characters' voicesLousy. The Michael Scott sounded like a woman with a hoarse voice. It really was That's what she said....cause it for sure was not a Steve Carell's voice.
1,don't waste your money!,It was broken when I received it and took a week longer than it was supposed to to arrive.
5,perfect!,We kept loosing our c-fold towel keyes and now we have bought these for extras. They arrived quickly and work great.
4,fun and deep,"I've only read one story from this book, but it inspired me to get the whole thing. Very good humor along with a subtle but profound spiritual message (if that makes any sense)."
4,Good 50's Ballads,"This CD contains 20 tracks recorded by the Five Keys for Capitol Records from 1954 to 1958. Although there is one excellent uptempo track, ""Ling Ting Tong"", the best cuts are the mostly doo-wop ballads ""Close Your Eyes"", ""The Verdict"", ""I Wish I'd Never Learned To Read"", ""I Dream I Dwelt In Heaven"", ""Out Of Site, Out Of Mind"", ""Wisdom Of A Fool"" and ""One Great Love"". On these there is excellent lead singing by Rudy West and good harmony from the rest of the group. This CD is dragged down by 6 tracks from a 1957 album with sappy ballad arrangements backed by a big band and a chorus. Only one of those cuts, ""To Each His Own"", is anywhere near the quality of the rest of the CD. The uptempo tunes are so-so. The liner notes are sparse with no discography."
4,Fabulous harmony from a seminal rock and roll doo-wop group.,"Can any body sing ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"" better than The Five Keys? I doubt it. Other beautiful songs include ""Close Your Eyes"". Great doo-wop!!"
4,Smooth Sound,"Despite the fact that many groups try to copy their sound, they're original, distinct and stand alone. The dynamic and romantic music of the Keys cannot be duplicated."
3,"Hard to wind, soft ticking, looks nice","This is a 2nd big ben for me. I have one from many years ago that looks almost the same but the body and buttons are very different. Winding this one is difficult, whereas the original is very easy. This one has one winder for the clock and and another for the alarm. The winder for the clock is too close to other the nobs even for my small hands. It is windable, but not easily accessible. The ticking is quieter than my original clock. The unit back is plastic where my original is metal. It is running a little fast and I will work with the adjustment screw to get that regulated. I am happy with the clock and plan to keep it, I am disappointed with the placement of the clock winding gadget."
1,Plastic Imitation,This clock is in no way a 1964 Big Ben Classic clock. It may look like one from the outside but is a cheaply made plastic imitation.
3,Not the quality of 1964,"The newer Big Bens are not as good as the older ones, especially the winding and time-setting mechanisms. Older models' keys are set far enough apart for regular-sized fingers and in a layout that is intuitive (example: combined time set vs. alarm set pull-out buttons rather than two separate buttons). The old models did not require a separate winding key for the alarm. The old models also had an alarm volume adjust which is now just LOUD. The mechanisms feel cheap and tinny, too. Made in China like everything else.I like non-electric, non-battery wind-up clocks. If I had known how this one operates, I might not have purchased it.If you have an older model that is overwound or needs oiling, it might be worth it to go to a clock repair shop and have them tinker with it rather than replacing with this new model."
1,Lost time,"What a piece of crap! After two weeks the alarm stopped, then it fell apart, literally!Do not but this clock!"
1,bummer of a clock.,hard to wind. Alarm is way to loud with no way to turn it down. very dissapointed. The service was great but did not like product.
4,"Cheap, but practical","This spring-wound clock was just what I was looking for. It's cheap, relatively sturdy, and it has an alarm loud enough to wake the dead. Be sure that you want a loud alarm if you buy this as an alarm clock. My only qualm with it is that it seems to have a short lifetime: about a year or less. Therefore, I recommend any purchaser to hold on to the included warranty: if the clock goes bust within a year (which it very well might), you can send it in for a new one free of charge. Good for travel, as you don't need to set the time every time you travel somewhere, as I have had to do when the backup battery of my electronic alarm clock ran down, as it inevitably did."
3,Hard to find Clock,"This clock was purchased for elderly friends. Their Big Ben clock of many, many years had broken and they could not find a replacement. They do not have a computer, so I offered to look for it online for them. Amazon had several. They picked the one the wanted; Amazon sent it. It arrived quickly. Everyone is happy with it."
3,Big Ben no classic,"The appearance is what I expected, but the floppy rings for the winding keys are awkward to use and the ""knobs"" for setting time and alarm are hard to turn."
3,1964 Big Ben Classic,"Big Ben needs diligent wind up every 12 hours or so. Otherwise, you'll lose 10 minutes or more from what is the actual time."
3,Not as nice as original,"I ordered this clock as a replacement for the one my Mom had for years. She had an old one that finally gave out. This clock is suppossed to be the classic Big Ben, but it is now made out of plastic. The original one is made out of metal and is much heavier and sturdier. They have also changed all the keys on the back of the clock, making it more confusing for an older person. I was disappointed that it was made so much cheaper than her other one!"
4,Big Ben alarm clock,Have always loved Big Ben alsrm clocks. The ticking sound lulls me off to sleep. No way to sleep through the loud alarm!
2,It works...but it's cheap,"It keeps time and the alarm works but it's really cheaply made. I had a Baby Ben growing up (one made in the mid 1970's) that was made of steel and I tried to destroy that thing as a little kid. And I was never able to do so.This version is the sterotypical product you would expect to get from China, super cheap and not very sturdy."
4,ALMOST as good as the original.,"This clock looked identical to the original in the picture, but it was not quite the same when I actually got it. Like everything else in our world, the materials used are cheaper....parts that used to be metal are now made out of plastic and put together in China. It is also larger and the alarm is louder than the original which is OK....I guess they figure that if you are old enough to have owned an original that you must be half blind and deaf by now. My husband owned his original for decades and it JUST finally quit working........I doubt this one will last nearly as long. Apart from that, it looks great in our country cottage style bedroom and you never have to worry about it not working if there is a power failure provided you remember to wind it every day."
2,Old School Clock,"Love it, but the hands do not glow enough to be seen at night. Feh. Like it otherwise, BUT this is a deal-breaker.To the landfill it goes!"
1,Works OK for a little while.,"I was looking for a real windup Westclox Big Ben like my parents owned in the 60's. Unfortunately, this is a pretty cheap imitation with a plastic case, and I'm guessing really cheap internal construction. Anyway, it was OK for about three months, but is now losing hours a day, sometimes just stops after less than 16 hours. I'm going to try one of the Sternreiter windup alarm clocks. They are actually made of metal with brass and steel gears inside."
1,Not so pleased,"Had a 60's Big Ben like this bought in early 60's. That one lasted over 30 years. Have had 2 Repos like these and they are crap. Each one only lasted about 9 to 10 months. Have had others too (wind up one) which don't even last a year. Have hearing problem and electric buzz clocks don't wake me up. Do what you want, but remember I warned you not to waste your money"
1,Big Ben Classic Keywind,"I purchased a keywind clock and found that the turn knob for the time set is nearly impossible to turn (we have to break out the tools to turn it). This is a complete hassle, so we called the manufacturer Focus Electronics INC. Needless to say, Focus Electronics is the most unfriendly company to its customers that I have experiance in 78 years I purchased a defective clock! When I called costomer service there attitude was ""ho-hum""; so whats new? They said ""It is your clock so deal with it."" STAY AWAY FROM FOCUS ELECTRIONICS AND ANYTHING THEY SELL!!!!!"
2,Critique,"This is a second rate product, inasmuch as it requires daily winding, Its time-keeping ability is too coarse and requires daily adjustment."
1,not worth it.,"buy this clock only if you want to wind it up every time you go to sleep. knife depot should let the consumer know that this is not an electric clock, and they dont tell us for good reason. youve got more to worry about than the FOUR steps it takes to set this thing and the ticking is so loud, go ahead and order some earplugs while your here. thanks a lot knife depot."
3,Yellow board buddies,These are well made and will probably work just fine when I figure out how I'm going to mount them! They do NOT fit on any kind of standard fence and even the track you buy is Rube Goldberg at best. If youre thinking you'll just clamp them on and go forget about it. This is definitely an afternoon's project and I dont feel like drilling a bunch of holes in my fence. Look closely before you buy them.
4,Board Buddies,I've been using these for twenty years in one version or another. I concur with the prior reviewer as far as deteriorating quality. The cast iron will crack if you give it a hard blow. Older versions were made of aluminum which held up considerably better.I can't imagine making a rip cut with out these. I can live with the lesser quality because the stellar safety performance offsets it.Purchase the tracks that go with it and I like the green wheels too.
2,"good for wood fences only metal fence no,Woodstock",First of all I think that the board buddy is a good idea. Safety is always an important issue with me.The board buddy is well made. In saying that I gave only 2 stars because the board buddy is a pain for people with metal fences. I have an expensive biesemeyer fence on my saw . I'm not about to drill holes and tap them in my fence to put in a track so I can use the board buddy.(fence has no pre-drilled holes ) I think that this should have been something that Woodstock should have stated in their description or made an adapter . I had to go online and research this to fix my problem.I was very disappointed that I couldn't use the board buddy when I needed it. I would not have bought the board buddy if I knew what I know now. I would have done something else. Good wood fences are not cheap unless you make one . It is something that a good wood worker can do and I'm not at that skill level yet. Not happy with Woodstock.
4,Board Buddies work well,I installed the board buddies on my table saw fence which fortunately had t-tracks on the top. Had to mount them on small pieces of plywood and then mount the plywood to the t-track. The work better than I expected.
4,Board Buddies,I purchased one set of Board Buddies and two 12 inch tracks. They came very quickly. I installed one track on my saw fence and one on my router fence. They have been working very well. I especially appreciate the way they hold down the rail and stile parts I have been making on the router. I would recommend them with one bit of advice. The 12 inch track would be a little short for table saws with 10 inch blades. The 24 inch would be better.
2,featherboards out-perform buddies,"I recently bought the board buddies and will return them. They do not pull the board into the fence as described by other people without tremendous down pressure being applied, resulting in having to stand directly behind the board to push it through, which we all know is dangerous. The anti reverse wheels actually do reverse (turning on the threads and not their own spindle) and I wouldn't trust them to stop kickback. Adjustment is a pain in the neck, I'm constantly catching my nuckles when adjusting the wingnuts: frustrating!However they do work very well for holding the board down vertically if used in conjunction with a traditional featherboard.These are gadgets that simply don't perform anywhere near as well as traditional featherboards."
5,Must-Have for the table saw,"Great little addition for any table saw (I purchased the green wheels for my shaper as well) - you'll probably need the track for it. Holds down, pulls towards the fence, and prevents kick-back all in one! Well worth it!"
3,"Good book for young children to ""read""",This is a small durable book made of cardboard pages with bright colorful pictures. The shapes in the book are identified by name and are a texture for the child to feel.
4,Who's the publisher?,"Nice reproduction of an old Catholic prayer book by an unknown publisher (Loreto?). What throws me off is the Gospels, Epistles and Prayers for the Sundays and Feasts of the Christian Year section, pp. 589-718a, where the King James Bible is used instead of the Douay-Rheims Bible. What gives? Something is bogus."
4,Love em',"I love these lipsticks, they make your lips feel so moisturized and color lasts forever. It does however seem that all colors turn my my lips pretty much the same color. Very slight differences, but I still love them."
4,Great book about breeding,"This book has good information from a solid breeder and it looks good too. A crazy purple budding plant wraps around the entire cover and it looks tasty. Inside there's useful charts and illustrations. PLUS, the color photo section has some nice photos.Sure, this information has been in Cannabis Culture Magazine, but I don't have time to read through back issues and find all the articles (if I even saved them all). I like having all this information in one place.I like this book. If you want to know how to go about breeding and stabilizing marijuana, you will like this book. DJ Short knows what he's talking about. His writing style is casual and straight forward. The book answered all of my questions about breeding and had some interesting asides and thoughts from DJ Short. Good stuff."
5,Love this Book,"It's extremely basic, but most people can't do the basics properly so this book is awesome."
3,It is what you think it is,"DJ Short is ""famous"" for a reason. He's an innovative breeder and his book is informative. Not a must-have for beginning growers."
4,it was good stuff,"I LIKE THE PART THAT BREAKS DOWN THE FLOVRS IN CERTAIN CATERGORYS ,WOULD OF LIKE MORE INSIDE ON recessive traits,and things to look for in certain plants for jus more inside maybe an extra chapter"
3,Disappointing item,"I bought this along with my Accu-Miter, thinking it would be a great addition to the miter gauge. Unfortunately, the clamp knob to set the height of this clamp cannot be tightened enough by hand to prevent the clamp assembly from coming loose on the post it's mounted on when the clamp is engaged. Also, when the clamp is tightened, it tends to lift the bar out of the saw's slot, allowing the stock to shift in relation to the fence. I have replaced the height knob with a standard hex head bolt, tightened with a wrench, which solves that problem, but unless the clamp is adjusted for just the right height (which is not that simple to do), the problem of lifting the bar and shifting the stock which I mentioned occurs. All in all, it's a good idea in theory, but I don't think it works that well. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,"Applause - One More ""No"" Vote","These are excellent performances of these concertos for Brendel. I particularly like his rendition of concerto no. 4. I'd also like to comment on the sub-issue going on in these reviews. Sorry Thomas, but I'd have to agree with the others on this one. These recordings would have benefited from the removal of the applause for the reasons cited. Like Thomas, I sometimes like to kick back, close my eyes and fantasize that I'm at a live performance when listening to a good recording. The fact is though that a recording is not a live performance. And even if it was, applause is not part of the performance. It's the audience's response to a good performance. The ""electricity"" felt at a live artistic performance is what elicits applause from those listening. It's based on such things as the beauty of the piece itself and the high degree of execution performed by the artists."
2,LIARS CLUB,"Although the stories of other inmates were extremly interesting, I cannot help getting the impression that Mr. Taylor was lieing about his own accounts. He periodically put other inmates down saying they were not strong, cool, or street wise as he was, yet everyone else seem to have a better deal than he did. My oppinion of Taylor is, assuming all the stories are true in his book, that he is bitter and is putting down the system that probably saved his life. Even though no one knows for sure, I classify this book fiction. Sorry."
3,THE LIARS COLONY,"I think you'll agree in this book that these ""snitches"" should have wound up in ditches!One who goes by the name ""squeegie"" (his picture is in the book)...BIG LIAR!He simply wanted to be in the fed protection program so he made up this elaborate story about a friend of mine and testified in court that got my friend ""the chair"".He is a MURDERER,if you ask me.People like this always wind up back stabbing when their heads are on the chopping board,as my now ""sentenced to die"" friend says.No telling how many innocent folks he has killed and will kill.Pretty good book though if you like fiction."
3,Great,What wisdom. Very wise and makes you think. Like. Due to it is short. Great book for fast read and thought
3,So-so; good idea not quite fully executed,"This book made me hope it would be good because it was a good idea to take the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin and apply it to business today and seeking to gain wealth. I found myself skipping past the in-between content to find more of what Ben Franklin had to say. It is hard to put today's writing alongside the brilliance of Franklin's so I give the author kudos for courage, but it didn't quite hit the spot for me. By the way, Franklin's Autobiography which contains his list of virtues is one of my favorites. It was part of the inspiration for my book series mentioned hereafter.Connie Neal, author of many books found at www.amazon.com/author/connieneal"
4,Nice summary of Franklin's book. But ... What's with the hat??,"Please read the subtitle on the cover: ""A 52 Brilliant Ideas Interpretation"".It's not Franklin's book. It's a discussion of 52 ideas from the Franklin's book. On that basis, it's a nice read.But why is there a stovepipe hat on the cover? Did the publisher get confused between Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln? I should see if they have an interpretation of The Gettysburg Address, maybe there's a three-cornered hat on the cover!"
3,Pedantic,"Franklin's book was definitley worth the read, but many of his thoughts have been regurgitated in many other self help business like books."
4,"It's not the actual Ben Franklin Book but ,more like someone's good book report on it!",I heard the actual Ben Franklin book was pretty good but only about 5 pages...This book is actually pretty long ...and I skimmed it and didn't see the actual text of Ben franklin's bok but rather tips the author gleaned from reading his book...It's pretty good for a free book!
5,Ben Franklin's wisdom,"I was surprised at how useful this book is for us now in this time. Ben Franklin was not only one of the most accomplished men of his time, but one of the riches. It's surprising that his keys to wealth are to unlock your potential as a human being and not ""investment strategies."" This is a great little book."
4,Franklin's Words are Classic,"This is a great book, small in size to fit into a pocket and well presented. However, some of Franklin's Middle English can be distracting. Editing the English, as is done inThe Way to Wealth and Poor Richard's Almanac (Nayika Wisdom of the World Series), would be a good improvement."
3,Good Advice; Hardly a Book worthy of Ben Franklin,"Had brevity been among Franklin's chief virtues, he would have indubitably been pleased with this work. The Way to Wealth accounts for approximately fifteen minutes of reading from cover to cover. Franklin's celebrated wisdom shall never diminish, yet this book merely accounts for a tiny element of Franklin's true sentiment.Among the good points, Franklin illustrates the amusement found in those who complain of the hindrance of taxes when idleness takes a far bigger piece of productivity. He stresses the importance of controlling your vices, watching expenses, and avoiding all forms of personal debt.As this was merely a segment from one of Franklin's Almanacs, it was clearly never intended as a full book. I recommend passing on this and seeking out some of the superior books on Franklin's principles such as ""Benjamin Franklin's: The Art of Virtue"" which covers significantly more thoughts from Franklin including the entirety of this book."
2,"Long On Wisdom, Short On Value","The words of wisdom from Benjamin Franklin are priceless. Unfortunately, at $9.95 this book offers little value to the buyer, since The Way to Wealth can be downloaded off of Google for free. The book is approximately 4""X7"" and only 30 pages long. The book is so small, it is easily missplaced in between other books on my bookshelf."
2,Just Be Tight Wad and Wear Old Garments.,There is not much to the book.Don't go into debt.Work Everyday.Save your money.Stay away from the Jones.O yea when you need a new jacket...wait another year to buy it.15 minute read I wish I had save the 3 dollars the book cost.
5,The Way to Wealth,"I think that The Way To Wealth is very good. Benjamin Franklin includes a lot of useful saying in it like, ""It is hard for an empty bag to stand up right."" After he writes a saying, he explains it. It's contents could very well be true to it's title."
4,Beautiful illustrations!,I enjoyed this book more than my child. It was a bit too scary for him. The illustrations are beautiful.
2,Didn't like this one,"My kids love scary stories, but this is a little too post modern for them. I wasn't crazy about the artwork and the story barely makes sense. My kids will sit through a lot (rudyard kipling, chapter books, etc.) but not this one."
3,5 year old spooked,"I got this for my 5 year old around Halloween. The story is kind of strange and the illustrations are quirky but very dark. I personally liked the story (turns out not so scary at the end). However, my 5 year old son was really spooked. The next time I suggested reading it, he said he doesn't like it because it's scary and dark... Maybe we'll try again next Halloween. I personally liked that it teacher time and you can have a discussion about 13-o-clock."
3,reel 2 real review,I bought the single when i went to France and saw the video and really liked it very much it was in 94' . It was a really good dance beat
2,A whole lot of nothing,"First of all, the research and information in the book is good. The author did a good job, it's obvious he did his homework. The problem is, there just isn't enough there, and he's not a very engaging author. The book is terribly boring and the philosophical inferences he makes from anecdotal historical hearsay is just quite a stretch. He gets even more lost when he speaks of modern cynics vs. Diogenes' Cynics. It's obvious this guy knows people as well as he knows entertaining writing.I can't tell you how long it took me to get through 200 mind numbing pages. You're better off reading the encyclopedia or even dictionary entry for Diogenes. At least that way you don't get this guy's attempt at writing. If I have to read ""defacing the `currency'"" one more time, I'll kill someone. Okay,Luis E. Navia, we get it. He defaced the value of society by being a jackass. Now stop saying it over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over...."
3,George Carlin Forerunner,"This is a book about a 4th century B.C.E philosopher of the George Carlin school. If you think, like I do, that George is the wisest thinker in America today, then this book is for you.This book has a limited audience, I admit. I would have preferred to read a good historical novel about this guy rather than a cold book of facts.(Added the following in July 08)I can't believe the people so far who voted against the above review actually read the book. I believe it's George they don't like. That makes me feel really, really good. As the late George Carlin once said: ""If there isn't at least a few people who walk out of my shows in disgust,I kinda think I'm not doing my job.""I wish I could end with a Carlin greeting to the naye-sayers, but I'm afraid I'm too timid."
3,"Biographical/Historical Account of Diogenes, Based on Author's Own Interpretation/Research","If you are interested in Diogenes' chreia (i.e., anecdotes, stories, etc) per se, then look somewhere else. On the other hand, if you are interested in the historical account of Diogenes the philosopher (Biographical/Social-Political/Historical Context), this book would suffice. In other words, the author's aim is to reconstruct the historical/social/political context in which the philosophical movement -known as Cynicism- emerged and its influence on Diogenes and his conversion."
3,Kindle edition lacking,"The book is great, and I enjoyed it, but the Kindle edition has a serious flaw--the links to the footnotes are non-existant."
1,Warming - not a romance!!!,"Just a quick work of advice: this is really not a romance, but a mystery and not a very interesting one at that. Romance is in the background. SInce this is the first in a series of stories about the couple solving mysteries, I would save my money and wait for the last book to come out since I would guess it will be during that book that the romance will really bloom."
1,Glad it's not still available,"This is the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon; unfortunately, since it was a gift to my daughter, I just yesterday (2-18-13) had an opportunity to use it. It left the lettuce wet, which makes sense, as the water stays in the bottom bowl and apparently spins up right back onto the lettuce. I have had one I bought from Target about 10 years ago for $7.00, and it works beautifully, as the bottom bowl drains right into the sink, and the lettuce is perfectly dry."
4,Get the 2 tape set,I recomend buying the Chrysler 2 tape set instead. You get this tape and one other for the same price.
5,Compelling Reading! A bestseller for sure!,"What a fantastic book! Hilary tells the story of her uncle and his life in Cuba with solid writing and superb prose. ""Hemingway in Cuba,"" by Hilary Hemingway, is sure to rank right up there with best of Earnest's literary works. Look for this book to top the NY Times best-seller list for a long time.I urge you to purchase this book right away! Great reading! Thanks, Hilary!"
4,Obszerna publikacja,"Album bardzo bogaty w ilustracje, niestety czesto jest ich kilka na stronie. Jest w nim duzo reprodukcji rysunkow, szkicow, akwareli czego brakuje w innych wydawnictwach o Hopperze. Kupilem ten album w miekkiej okladce i to byl blad. Zdecydowanie wygodniejsza bylaby twarda okladka. Ksiazka typowo dla fanow tworczosci Hoppera."
4,Comprehensive and up-to-date reference for MTs,"This book just came out, so it's really up-to-date; the info is thorough and comprehensive, and I've only run across a couple of unusual abbreviations/acronyms that haven't been in here. Well worth the purchase price and invaluable to MTs and anyone dealing with medical documents!"
2,Alec stole my music!!,"I saw ATR at a festival some years ago and was blown away by the power of energy, aggression and the in-your-face attitude of the band. I went back home and bought pretty much everything they released and I like it. When I saw that Alec Empire's new album was out I bought it. It was about 1,5 years ago I think. At first its the same energy as ATR but...Stealing (not just sampling) is not ok. For example: Listen to ""Vulgar display of power"" by Pantera and you will know what Im talking about. Write and produce your own damn music or at least filter your ""samplings"" a bit. Thief!I give this record a 2 becouse of there is a couple of decent songs on th first CD and the ""artsy"" nature of CD no 2."
1,Alec Empire?,"This is not the Alec Empire that the origional Tech-Terror fans of 'The destroyer', 'Squeeze the Trigger', 'Generation Star Wars', or 'deathfunk' will know. This is Alec Empire Attempting to please Atari Teenage Riot Fans buy realeasing an album in the same style, and if you are an ATR fan, go ahead and buy. But for the original fan's sake alec please stop singing and do what you do best which is shattering our eardrums with lightspeed drumloops, samples of women screaming and robotic profanities."
4,Great Little Hold-Downs,I just installed a pair of these on my shaper. The only problem I had was that I thought the Board Buddies tracks were sold in pairs. They are not. Since my shaper is small I cut the track in half and mounted both halves on either side of the spindle. I tested the wheels out and they seem to hold the work piece down firmly. This is important especially when you are forming the entire edge of a board such as in making raised panel doors. I highly recommend that anyone with a shaper make this investment.
3,"Great idea, hard to set up.","I bought these for a shaper. I spent a solid day configuring these wheels and building the proper mounting blocks. They do indeed help, but it is a thin line between having enough tension to keep it against the rail and not being able to pass the material under the 2nd wheel.This theoretically should require less setup time for repeat work, but I find featherboards work better for me, since I make a lot of short runs."
3,not a jack of all trades,"I'm sure that ,being the woodworker folk the smart people they are , they can conceive a way to adapt these beautiful products to work. For me .....I made the mistake of not buying the rail, so me too spent a full afternoon trying to adapt them to the table saw and the shaper fence. Buy the rail.I often work with thin stock , and my fences are too tall , so the wheel can't reach down all the way. Re-design the fences is only a part of the problem ; You can't effectively use a push stick with these rollers installed.The spring is much too strong for thin stock although You can partially tune it.I bought the yellow type too , anti-kickback. I hope to have another free afternoon sooner or later...."
5,Everyone needs these!,"These board buddies are a great safety tool, a great extra pair of hands where you don't want your hands to be...on any saw or other machine that cuts wood. It keeps the board moving through the saw straight and steady without any danger to limbs. I highly recommend!"
1,This is NOT AN HERBALIFE PRODUCT. SHAM,"This product is a sham! I have been using Niteworks that i bought from Herbalife and what i bought here is not the same product. Taste, texture, smell are different. I will be reporting this to Herbalife. What i received looked just like the real thing. Upon opening it, i tasted it and immediately spit it out. It taste like a mixture of the artificial sweetner 'Equal"" with a protein powder. Folks, dont buy this product online. By the way, i also bought their HERBAL TEA from Herbalife, i also returned it. BUYER BEWARE"
5,Stopped my chest pain,"I had high cholesterol and was experiencing chest pain on my left side (Heart). After using this product for 3 months, my chest pain disappeared and my cholesterol dropped 68 points. I cant wait to get my cholesterol checked again in another 3 months. I did combine this product with eating grapefruit every night so I am not sure which did the trick but together, they probably saved my life. I could not be happier. Thank you Dr. Ignarro."
3,"General content is great, but format'd have been better","I love author's language and his way of explaining things to the reader. It really works. The overall content of the book is very useful. But, I can't say the same thing about its format. This book is big and not in an ""easy-to-use"" style. I think it should have had ""easy-to-use"" reference format, since it is a ""Screenwrites's Bible"". It really is one of those books, that you have to refer over and over again, while you are in a process of writing. Also, the author does not give much info about how to market/sell your work; he only points out quite obvious things and general directions in regard to the subject. Despite the flaws, this book can really help you to start out."
4,Valuable,"I'm not a big fan of books that claim to teach people how to write. However, this book deals with formatting issues that many people who have never written a screenplay will be confronted with and it answers their inevitable questions succinctly.If you aren't new to screenplay format, this book will probably not be incredibly useful to you (though it might have the odd answer to the odd question); but if you are about to begin your first journey into the world of the screenplay, this book will prove to be very valuable."
4,"Good beginners book. Explains everything clearly, and simply","It is just like the David says, there are many little books all in this one book. Although it often refers to other films ideas, instead of explained the ideas and functions, this is where it can be a little to basic in a sense. But saying that, it helped me out a lot when it came to presenting my idea in a professional manner. The book also has a very good resources section, where all you lucky Yanks get plenty of address to write to for additional info on course, compo's, and agents/studios. This book is very good, even better if you are a beginner, like me, although maybe not so good for the experienced writer."
5,Of the hundreds of good screenwriting books-buy this one!,"Of the hundreds of good screenwriting books--buy this one. Everything is easy to understand. The material is well organized, you can find just the inf. you need on writing great dialogue, formatting, marketing and so much more! The questions in the front of the book alone are worth the price of the book: As a reader, I wish everyone bought and read this book before writing word one. As a writer, I turn to it often. You want more than the basics of screenwriting? Start here, you can't go wrong"
5,A really good book to have,"if you're just starting to write, having this book will be of immeasurable value to you."
3,the screenwriter's Bible,"Excellent guidelines, exhaustive, well written : a friend which makes you do miracles in screenwritings. It encompasses many of the issues that we might face. It addresses the non specialists and makes them excellent experts in the field. Easy, clear and constructive."
5,Makes me feel like I'm ready to start writing.,An easy read for potentially daunting subject matter.It lays the foundations very clearly.It also successfully balances creativity with a practical scientific approach.
5,Highly Recommended!,"As the author of ""Screen & Stage Marketing Secrets"" I highly recommend screenwriters to read ""The Screenwriter's Bible."" This book solves many of the problems of properly formatting screenplays. The book solidly sets up the structure of the story you are writing in the proper script format -- precisely what agents and production companies need to submit a script to higher levels of management for a green light. If you follow the advice given in this book, you will have a screenplay with the major critical elements installed. This will satisfy story analysts. You'll be satisfied with the results, too! This book is of high value to the screenwriter, as a properly formatted script will be recognized as a professional submission in Hollywood. Professional submissions are a prime critical element that gets script's sold!"
5,A great help.,"This was very helpful in every aspect from formatting to Marketing plan. If you want to learn how to write a screenplay, buy this book."
4,Great place to start,"I was already a writer before tackling screenplays, so I was not looking to this book for advice on how to write. I needed help with the dos and don'ts of the screenplay format and that's exactly what I got. ""Elements of Style"" it isn't, but there are many good tips about how to handle characters and story in the screenplay form. If you are a new writer or a slave to prose, this will help.The book helped me understand the differences between the scripts you read in script libraries and the spec script you want to write and sell. I found out that even my latest upgrade for Screenwriter 2000 software includes by default things that are not format-appropriate for spec scripts. How much time and trouble did that little tidbit save me? [price]bucks very well-spent."
3,Review,"It is a good guide but would have been much better if it included agency listings. I recommend it as a guide to preparing your script to be sold, but not as a resource with contacts."
5,BEST BAR NONE!!!,"I have read three editions of this authors book strating with the gren one up to the current one and they just continue to get better.The author really knows what he is talking about.This book on ""spec"" screenwriting is, in my opinion, the best around."
1,kindle,"Actually I was never able to download this product so I ordered the book which I love. I looked and looked for a receipt with the link and it never came and there was never a confirmation email that I could respond to or complain to, so I was not happy with this. I've had absolutely no problem with previous kindle orders but this one gave me nothing. I hate giving dings if I can work it out another way, but so sorry."
4,I am famous,"In the two weeks since i bought and read this bible, I have become a celebrity superstar. see me this fall as creator/writer/star of Fill Me Up. A new comedy about the price of gas in the U.S."
4,The Bible,And what a great bible it is. Very informative. This guy knows his stuff. Very helpful. Highley reccommended
2,"Examples, no simplistic worksheets","I own this book, and it's terrible. Many of the so-called examples are extraordinarily simplistic. The likes of which I'd not seen since grade school. No joke!And, perhaps most remarkably, there are no real worksheets given to help write. A far better choice for beginners is The Screenplay Workbook: The Writing Before the Writing, by Jeremy Robinson and Tom Mungovan. It will give you a much stronger set of story creation tools, including some excellent worksheets on plot structure, and has plenty of worksheets to start your writing. But whatever you do, avoid The Screenwriter's Bible."
2,Don't care for it,The writer likes to make this book all about funny quotes from his wife and nephew. It is a total turn off. I quit reading it. I want instruction not a campy book of quotes.
2,A Lot Of Hype....But Not Worth It!,"Very disappointed in this purchase. High unorganized and hard to follow way to write a book. What the heck? I buy books to help me, not confuse and irritate me! Some good points but mostly my anger speaks more about this book than anything."
3,"Good, but a little too flip and high-handed","Along with his meat and potatoes, author gives an ambsolutely horrible ""example"" of a script. Meant to be funny, but commiting too many mistakes that novices will take to heart as models to follow. Samples of SUCCESSFUL scripts (not just the author's own ""phone-it-in"" examples) are absent. One ""inside"" trick that he fails to mention is that ""reverse-adapting"" a novel from your script (much easier to sell to a publisher) puts you on the fast track to getting (nay, DEMANDING) the right to do the first-draft screenplay adaptation. (Which, obviously, you already have ready to go!) For specific tips on adapting your idea into a highly commercial, salable novel, read ""Seven Strategies in Every Best-Seller""--which also gives practical insights into creating compelling characters who appeal to an audience and whom A-list actors want to play."
5,"If you ever want to sell a screenplay, you need this book!",I bought this book hoping to find out the basics of screenwriting in preparation for an upcoming college course. I was pleasantly surprised to find a comprehensive volume of information. Every aspect of writing AND selling a screenplay are covered. This book will remain a permanent part of my personal library!
4,"Nearly perfect in design, perfect in quality","Ordered the bag from Big Frog Mountain through Amazon and got it quickly and well packaged. The item actually shipped directly from Engel in Jupiter, FL. The quality of the bag is top-notch. Would have given it 5 stars but the bag interferes with the latch on the frig lid a bit. It makes it kinda hard to reach between the frig and the cover to latch and unlatch the lid. Not a huge deal, but a big inconvenient to access the latch. I'm afraid it may mess up the inner foil surface of the bag over a short period of time."
4,Kiss the Night Good-bye,"This book is part 4 in an early series written by Keri Arthur. After reading her current series (the Riley Jenson Guardian novels) I wanted a better look at her work.I was very impressed. Her characters continue to grow and evolve from the first book to this one. The storyline, while it stands alone, works with the entire series.An excellent read!"
3,Not the best but it's ok I guess,"Some of it is pretty good, and for $1.99 I shouldn't expect to be amazed. I should have previewed the tracks online before buying this. The collection is full of ""Gerbil McDoof Remix"" and some of the remixes are as dumb as what they're named. If you're expecting a BEST OF BRITNEY collection, pass on this. I should have used the restroom a couple hours ago, darn it just look at my bed! Ugh this number 2 stain might not come out with bleach. Also, lame remixes done in a studio isn't what I was wanting either. Frustrating!"
4,"Never a Britney fan, but impressed by the sound","I picked this up because, first, Amazon had the mp3 on sale for real cheap, and second, Richard Thomson once did a brilliant solo acoustic cover of ""Did It Again"" in an interview I heard. Mostly when the name came up around me it was someone citing her career as somehow being example number 1 of what was wrong with the music biz. What I hear in these songs is that a lot of time and talent went into the sound, the production if you will. It's really smooth and has a lot of interesting musical bits all fit together perfectly. It's only in the few slow numbers where things break down for me, like it's trying to make me think it's gotten all moody and confessional and I don't believe it for a moment. But the next song will be another celebration of dancing and flirting and making out and we can forget about all those troublesome real feelings again, and surely there is a time and place for that."
3,"Not good, not bad, just generic","I concur with Santa Fe Listener on this one...this is classic Muti, preferring not to take any chances, remaining true to his belief that the composer, rather than the conductor, should do the talking. While his performances don't have the same creepily synthetic quality of later Karajan, nonetheless it has the generic, all-the-notes-in-right-place flavor which makes it all too easy to forget after a short time.As a cycle, it is nicely affordable & certainly doesn't run roughshod over the music, so it at least has that going for it. I guess it would a good starter set for the novice, but for anyone already familiar with these symphonies, there are far better sets (my own personal preference is Walter) from which to choose."
3,cheap book,saved a bunch of money versus buying a new book. book was clean and not to torn up for a used book
5,A great book,"I read both the French and the US versions of this book (the latter is an updated and expanded version of the former) and nowhere does the author say that the United States should not have fought WW2 (as claimed by another reviewer). In fact, the author is much more sympathetic to the US than the average French person. This makes his warnings all the more important. In addition, this book is perhaps one of the best analyses that one can find on the ""War on Terror"". All in all, a great book."
5,An outsider's view,"This nifty little book is a quick read that gives the reader an analysis of the current global war on terrorism. The author gives a broad overview of the underlying etiologies of the war which flow from the events of 11 September and America's response. If you would like one unifying theory of this war we fight, this is the book for you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is a very poorly written book. If you follow the instructions, none of your programs will work. If I could give it a ZERO stars I would. I wasted my money on this book."
5,Love it!,This was so good on thin Italian bread toast. It's also wonderful as a pasta sauce. I added black olives and sun dried tomatoes.
3,Maybe worn a little more than advertised,This is a nice watch but I bought it because it was only supposedly worn a few times. Judging by the wear of the band and the lack of a Hamilton box or paperwork I am assuming this watch was older and worn more than the buyer suggested. I am keeping the watch.
3,coldcut gone dance floor?,"this was totally unexpected ... the tracks on this album are focused around a dance floor sound, it's not the coldcut you know from classics like ""say kids"" and ""beats and pieces"". instead, it's all a dancable beat ... crazy, and not at all what i expected when i tuned in.hard core coldcut fans, avid listeners of solid steel and ninja tune afficianados will want to give this one a full listening before they plunk down some cash for this one. i expect many of that crowd who tend towards the hip-hop and breakbeat sound of coldcut will be disappointed with this collection."
4,Dance mania,"This is one of the best dance tracks from 80's. Just hope to find allso those long 12"" versions allso, but even these album edits are great!"
4,Great look!,"I really like this shelf. It was very easy to install if you have the mount right on the stud and cable management is very nice and covers all the cables as expected. I have never had an issue with the product in the 2 years I have owned. I am able to take the cover off the cable management area and make changes without issue. The shelf is very sturdy and is quality glass. I have a DVR, DVD player, Apple TV and DVR expander drive all sitting on it without any problems."
1,Just Marketing,"They announce five brushes in the photo, and speak in the plural of the characteristics of these brushes, but it is really a marketing trick . It's just a brush and it is junk..."
3,A little too basic for me,"Beware that several of the cool sounding recipes you might see in the table of contents are tricks; once you actually turn to the correct page to see how the author has managed to implement something you might have formerly believed to be impossible, you will be greeted only by a placeholder paragraph stating that what you want to do IS in fact impossible. Why on Earth would you waste paper printing this?The other, less cool, recipes are pretty standard faire, and if you have any experience with Apache whatsoever they will probably not be very useful to you. Complete newcomers however will probably find it somewhat handy, though I'm not sure it's worth the price even for them."
1,Not beginner friendly,"The kind of solutions this book gives are not aimed at someone like me, new and uncertain when it comes to linux. This is a dissapointment for me, as I have normally always been very pleased with O'Reilly books."
5,Bought 6 of it already!,"This paste is as good as eating the olive itself.Although I haven't tried in pasta yet,I highly recommend buying it.I love eating it with crostinis or on the top of my saltine."
4,confusion is abundant in these reviews,"Yes, it's got no commercial potential, yes it's arty, yes it's not always catchy, but it is worthwhile for the SY fan. My version is just 1 track which makes it that you have play it all @ once, but it was originally a tape just so you could paly a couple of minutes @ a time like Vocabularinist's tapes are now. You have to remember that SY were not a pop group back then so this & GOO are diametrically opposed while both good. If you pay attention, there are great live versions of Confusion is Next, Burning Spear, & spaced out instrumental pieces + it will probably shut up that Pantera fan who thinks SY aren't hardcore enough."
2,I can't find the word to describe it,"O.K. maybe 4 stars if you're a hardcore fan but if want to get into Sonic Youth? Do not buy this, you will be deluded and think they're not good which they are. The other review (the ONLY other review) said GOOFY, yeah, really, really goofy and weird. I agree. There are no vocals, just a bit of shouting and stuff, at the end it's pretty good, oh and in the middle they talk about burgers or something. This CD is like a non-vocal Portishead with a bad cold. It's old stuff, go for the new."
1,No subtitles,"I feel deceived as there is no subtitles available for the whole feature, in contrast to what is stated on the box!!!!"
3,No subtitles,"Planet Earth from BBC does have subtitles. Plus its dialogues seem very repetitive. Like ""The sun is hot. Its like really really hot. Its surface is a bazillion degrees hot. Its the hotter place on the universe."""
3,The Universe,"Not normally a fan of space documentaries, but this one was highly interesting and easy to follow. I especially liked the easy analogies that they used, making previously too-difficult information go down a bit easier."
5,Great set,I got this for my husband and he just loves it. The content is easy to understand and very informative with all different subjects from the different seasons.
5,Master woodworker,Have had other saw blades that claim that they are the best on the market. Since using my new Forrest Woodwoker II I can say without a doubt that it is probably the best blade for the home woodworker. The cuts are so smooth that little sanding is required. I plan to buy another blade in the near future in order to have a spare on hand when I have to get the blade sharpened. Thanks again for a great blade.Ron May
5,Previously skeptical,I was previously skeptical that the Woodworker II blade could be as good as people raved. My first use for the blade was cutting hard maple. I had a hard time distinguishing between jointed edges and edges cut on the blade. I'm skeptical no longer - silky smooth cuts.The carbide welds had some wierd wire-like protrusions - but that doesn't seem to be a problem at all.
5,"Surprised, but shouldn't have been","I have read the reviews of this saw. I just couldn't see myself paying almost $100 on a saw blade. Then when I was able to get a great deal on one I decided it was time. The results of the quality of this blade blew me away. I was very impressed with the smoothness of the cuts. I ripped some oak stock and crosscut some plywood with glass smooth results on each. I will never buy a cheap blade agian. I would recommend this blade to anyone shopping for a new saw blade. Even if you are not a very serious wood worker, you can buy this blade and it will outlast and way outperform 3 or 4 cheap blades."
3,Mmmmmmm..... Not so sure.,"I received my blade and returned it the very next day.It had a wobble, which made cutting feel very unsafe.A blade with this reputation and price should not wobble.Also, the one cut that I made on 1/2"" ply was ragged.The blade that came with my Bosch TS cut cleaner.I use premium Tenryu blades, and they are a pleasure to use."
5,Unbelievable!,"I read many of the reviews of the Woodworker II blade but I couldn't believe all the gushing.I found the blade on sale at Rockler ... and I needed to replace my original blade on my contractor saw so I went ahead and got it. As soon as I installed it I noticed that it was more ""straight"" than my original blade.Once I made my first cut I was sold. I couldn't beleive how smooth the finish was. I'm not sure if they do some special stuff with the tooth shape or what, but man does it look good.This blade has lived up to the hype.Now don't get me wrong though. You are still cutting wood. Sawdust is flying, noise is being created, electricity is being used. . . . This blade is not supernatural, it just does a very good job (and for that much money it should).Bradman"
5,Great Blade,I'm new to woodworking and needed a good blade to help not to tax my contractor saw motor and this one does well. I have a Ridgid 3650 and I've ripped and crosscut some 2x4 Douglas Fir for a recent project and the cuts were nice and smooth and clean. This is a great combination blade and I look forward to years of use.
5,The best for any price,"After buying two different Freud blades for my miter saw and not liking the quality I read some reviews for the Freud to see again if there was something wrong, I discovered one review that said I should forget the Freud blade and go straight for the Forrest WW11, I did and I can say there is not a blade out there that can hold a candle to this blade. when I opened the package I thought I bought a used blade because it had been personlized, the teeth are so large and sharp you must handle it carefully or get cut. So I installed it and you would not believe it, It is spot on true and with only 40 teeth it cuts so smooth it looks like its went thru the jointer. so if you are looking for the very best look no further, put this blade on your table saw and you can cut anything, anyway."
5,Best Blade Ever!,"I resisted buying a Forrest blade due to cost. Then I saw (pun intended) a great sale on amazon and went for it. Best blade I've ever used. Crosscuts are smooth as glass, rip cuts are a dream. Just make sure your table saw blade is parallel to the fence and the miter gauge. This blade has cut everything I've thrown at it flawlessly; hardwood, veneers, A1 plywood, melamine, you name it, and it excels at it. Watch amazon.com for blade sales, well worth it."
5,Great blade,"I spent some time looking at reviews in both magazines and online before I purchased this blade. I was very glad I did choose it. The quality of the cut on my old craftsmans 3/4hp tablesaw is excellent. I have cut maple, red oak, cherry (no burning), ebony, pine, doug fir, bass, assorted plywoods and masonite with it and found the cuts to be very clean with almost no tearout on the backside, even without a zero clearance insert. One of the interesting things I did find about this blade is that it doesn't sing, or scream though the wood as some other blades I have used. Its sighs through. Very quietly."
2,Why Has The Original Version Changed?,"I have a ""Weekly Reader BookClub"" version that I found at a garage sale about 25 years ago. It has been well-read and much loved over the years.When I saw the current edition in a bookstore recently, I thought I would replace my worn copy. My reaction to the current edition was, ""What have they done to this story?!"" I realize the movie's release probably has something to do with the changes. For me, though, the name change from Liz to Andi, and Sadie's name change to Friday, ruins it. I will stick to reading the 1971 edition; I just finished reading it to my sons and they loved it, especially the illustrations by Leonard Shortall. As for how Hollywood butchered this wonderful story when they made it into a movie; well, better not go there except to say I won't waste my time or money! I'll re-read my good old book!"
4,Very Original Storyline!,"What a fun childrens' book! Both my brother and I liked ""Hotel for Dogs"". It was a charming, childhood story. After all, wouldn't every pet-loving kid relish in the idea of creating a hotel for doggie visitors? Sounds like a terrific idea to me. I wish that I could join in the with the characters in the book. If you're looking for a fun book with new original storyline concepts, this should be the one you pick up."
1,Accelerated Reader - Warning,"Don't get bit if buying this book for Accelerated Reader tests -- the ISBN of this version is different, and as stated above, the character and text have apparently changed!As of this review, there is no updated version of AR Quiz No. 60565 EN for this version! Avoid this version for now if you're purchasing for AR purposes.(The one-star rating is only for this reason, and not for the quality of the book itself.)"
5,No Wrinkles,I bought a while ago and recommend it to everyone. Works great on not only fine lines around the eyes but I also use it on that line between my eyebrows which is no longer there. I'm trying it on the fine wrinkles above my lip now. Great product
2,Seemed to make more wrinkles,My eye area seemed to become crepey and a lot more wrinkled after using this product on several different occasions.
1,Save your money for a better Product,"The ""Q10 Advanced Wrinkler Reducer"" does not work. It really dried up my baggy eyes. I stopped using it after the first use.Instead, I tested it on my hand. you know. just to make sure. And I was right, it does NOT even work on my hand. it sucked my natural oily hands.Conclusion: Do not use this product on any part of your skin. Save your money and look for a better brand/product."
4,A Good place to start,"Whilst other reviews might criticise this book for not going into enough detail, it does work out as either a good foundation for further study, or simply as an interesting insight. It covers most aspects of the war, providing unbiased and clear points, with summaries to help simplify the arguments. It demonstrates the sudden changes and shocks that this new, technological world war presented each of the powers, particularly the stubborn Japanese Imperial code, and how the ordinary soldier was affected, often fatally. The book presents a range of careful individual personal profiles, mirroring the events, that so-often suffered from similar flaws, and in turns leads to an intriguing summary of the simple problems that were magnified into major flaws in planning and procedure. This is a good textbook, or a good read."
5,Good Start on an Interesting Topic,"The only trouble with writing a book on the errors made in WW II, is deciding which ones to throw out. The amazing thing is that after all was over, we won.The book is well organized and tries to apply some structure to the errors, but it could easily be twice its size. For instance where is Kasserine Pass, the Hurtgen Forest, the whole strategic bomber campaign (well, part of that is covered here), Operation Cobra (where the highest ranking American officer, Lt. Gen. McNair, was killed by our own Air Corps)."
3,not a bad precis of the obvious mistakes of ww2,Macksey gives a good overall summary of some of the major errors of the war.....the only problem I have with him is that he seems to think that German defeat of soviet Russia may have been a good thing. I consider this to be a little worrying as bad as Stalin was he did not deserve to have his people slaughtered on mass
3,"Nelson, old school","I guess I'm spoiled by the internet age media. For a design book, I felt the illustrations to be dated (because it is dated). Of course, my impressions would be different if I found the designs more compelling. Instead, I found many of the furniture designs and color schemes to be childish, non-functional, and in short, somewhat kitsch. They struck me as immature or incomplete attempts to render the spirit of Bauhaus movement and De Stijl coloring. All of this may be forgivable, if there was a solid text to go with the illustrations that explain the philosophy behind the design. But, beyond the introduction, this, too, is lacking.However, the book is a neat little tome - could make a good miniature coffee table gift."
5,A great book!,I highly recommend this book. It is a great auto-biography of the brilliant actor Paul Henreid. It's a great and interesting book to read.
5,planetarium,"I dont know what I was really expecting to get when I ordered this software. This certainly wasnt the sort of software I was expecting to receive.I was expecting something that was perhaps a bit colder but, what I received was an exceptionally user friendly product that has provided me with hours of entertainment.This is a great product for children, too. But anyone with an interest in astronomy should definitely buy this."
3,excellent supplement,"An excellent supplement to a course on Egyptian history, it should be used with a more politically focused book or by an instructor who likes to spend hours going through the rulers and the major political/military events. The book does concentrate on a few periods in Egyptian history, but then the evidence does not allow for much detail. Written in a fairly clear manner, a good instructor will find it useful and students will find many sections of it more interesting than the lists of pharoahs."
5,OLD SCHOOL SOUND,"THIS WAS A TALENTED GROUP. I LOVE THEIR HARMONY, ALL MY FAVORITES,THIS IS A MUST HAVE, CD, IF YOU ARE A TRUE HARMONY LADENED LISTNER."
1,Piece of crap,"Every page has a black mark every few inches on the left margin. The ink is not bright, clear & crisp. Instead it is light, as though you're almost running out. Sheesh! Several pages come out good. Then several pages come out bad, with a light gray tinge over the entire page (you see this when toners are running out & starts to streak unevenly)--this is like a light even streak over the entire page. Since I don't have a backup, I'm stuck with using this crap! Won't be purchasing from this company ever again! Would give 0 stars if the option was there."
1,At your own risk,"This product worked for a few months, but then I started to hear a terrible grinding noise in my printer. I thought there was something wrong with my printer, but when I switched out this toner, all the terrible noises and printing problems went away. When I contacted the company, their response was that my request was outside of the 180 day warranty period, so the One year warranty on this page is a lie. I now have useless toner that almost ruined a perfectly good printer. Very shady and purchase at your own risk (you might end up losing your printer)."
5,Excellent toner cartridge order,The price was excellent and delivery was very prompt. I installed the toner cartridge on my Samsung ML-1740 and am 100% happy with the printouts.
5,Excellent quality,"I have used this toner for the last three weeks now. So far, the print quality is excellent."
5,Great Deal on These Toner Cartridges,I bought two of these cartridges for my two Samsung Laserjets. These produce the same quality of print as the original cartridges manufactured by Samsung. The cost of two cartridges was cheaper than one cartridge at Office Depot or Office Max. i.e. About $50 for two compared to $160 for two Samsung cartridges.
2,It works OK but out of toner very fast,"SAM REMAN ML-1710D3 works very good but out of toner very fast. I bought this for replacing the old one that I bought from the same seller. I love the previous one, but this time I bought 2 and I was unlucky both of them were out of tone in 6 months. I rate 2 stars for this product"
3,Didn't live up to my anticipation...,"Due to the amount of difficulty that I had in actually acquiring this book, I think I elevated my anticipation for it to an unreasonable amount. It picks up not long after The Various Haunts of Men ended, and here the focus revolves around the series' titled man character. Unfortunately, the plot isn't quite as intricate as the first novel in the series. The ending's lack of a resolution also is a bit frustrating. But since this is a sequel, there should be more information in the next book. The parts of the plot that are revealed in this installment were surprisingly predictable, but it definitely is still a gripping read. It just really is a much simpler story than the book that precedes it in the series. Hopefully the third book will be more like the first one than this one."
2,Why do I keep buying Susan Hill's mysteries after reading this book?,"I could tell by the pages left in my Kindle thatthere wouldn't be much of a resolution for this mystery.Little did I know there would be NONE! The greatestmystery about this is why Simon became a detective.He never thinks outside the box. His ""guv"" is alwaystrying to promote him, but why?Still I continue to buy and read Susan Hill's Simon Serrailer novels becauseof her other characters like Simon's sister Kat, her children, andothers in the community of this cathedral town. The quality of Hill's writing andher psychological insights keep me intrigued, but Susan if you writeanother stinker like this one, you might turn off this reader for good. Don'tdo that because I'm one of your biggest fans."
1,MUCH INFERIOR SEQUEL..........,"Susan Hill's VARIOUS HAUNTS OF MEN was a revelation. It was well written with exceptional 3 dimensional characters, a great suspense building plot and had a very unique atmosphere about it as it made its surroundings more than real. It was honestly one of the best books I have ever read.i was thrilled that this was a series and had much anticipation with reading this second in the series. It did follow up where the other left off. It is well written in its own way but is nothing in comparison to the first. The suspense does not exist here. The atmosphere does not exist here. And most importantly it is not written in a way where you care about the characters.SPOILER - The main character from the first novel is not present here and it seems her heart was what carried the novel. There is no character as interesting in this book.Somewhat well written but very subpar pschological novel."
4,Excellent Crime Series,"I thoroughly enjoyed Susan Hill's Simon Serrailler series. Her characters are well-thought out : complex, quirky, engaging.She ties all three books (The Various Haunts of Men, The Risk of Darkness, and The Pure of Heart) together extremely well. They are suspenseful, intriguing, and at times, heart breaking. I recommend all three highly - but be sure to start from the beginning with ""The Various Haunts of Men""."
3,**PLEASE FLAG SPOILER REVIEWS**,"I immensely enjoyed Susan Hill's book Various Haunts of Men, and was browsing reviews to see what readers thought of the new one. I've already come across two spoilers. Obviously, this robs the reader of the enjoyment of discovering for himself and as the author intended, a plot development or key revelation. Avoid Pineapples review for Pure In Heart spoiler, and Bukowsky for Haunts spoiler - two interesting reviews expcept for that. (Rating note: Not having read the new book, in an attempt to leave the rating average as uneffected as possible, I gave the book 3 stars - average?)"
2,"A study of uncommunicative relationships and life chances, more than a crime novel","I started off enjoying this book and thought I was going to like DCI Simon Serrailler as he seemed a caring, likeable chap with a deep love for his severely handicapped sister and a fondness of art. However I didn't feel we really got to know him any better, other than to find out he obviously has problems with relationships, possibly a mixture of his strange uncommunicative family and his job, and was actually a pretty disappointing character.I found Susan Hill's descriptive writing conjured up scenes and images in my mind very easily, not flowery descriptions, just everyday believable ones. However the story line all felt a bit flat and I kept thinking things would tie together somehow or there would be a satisfying end but it was just the opposite. I can cope without having everyone living happily ever after but this left me feeling cheated of purposeful story line."
2,What just happened here?,"When I saw I had fewer than 50 pages left to read, I wondered how everything was going to get tied up with so little of the book left. I see now that I was right to wonder. Quite a few storylines are opened up in this book and few of them, including the main one, are resolved. The characters are well done but it's as if the plot is an afterthought. I found ""The Various Haunts of Men"" also a bit unsatisfying; I may give the author one more chance, but if after a third try I have the same experience I'm done."
2,ultimately unsatisfying,"Hill's book is well-written, but ultimately unsatisfying.What is the point of a mystery in which nothing is ever resolved, or even explained?Although the characters are intriguing, the reader is left frustrated and disappointed in the end."
1,"Depressing, unsolved mystery","I was thoroughly disappointed with the outcome of this book. At the beginning, the characters were fresh and the scene was set for a good mystery. About halfway through, the book seemed to take a bad turn. Characters and actions rambled on and on while the plot went nowhere. I finished the book out of curiosity, but was sadly disappointed when no true conclusions were reached, and the mystery was left unsolved. Sad, just sad."
1,Not really worth reading,"I read the first book The Various Haunts of Men, which I was not thrilled with, however, I thought the second one would finish the first books story, not so. This book is a completely new crime, which, of course is never resolved. The main character is flat, unpersonable, too handsome, too talented, too boring.The excitement of discovering a new author was soon deflated, this 2nd novel is the last I will read of this author. One sees the crime from different eyes, nothing is ever resolved, we see this in our own daily lives or in crimes that are in the news, I read mystery books for resolution, for closure, for believing in good wins in the end. Sadly this is not the author for me, if you like being left hanging you may enjoy the author."
5,Timeless Blue-eyed Soul,This CD reminded me of how fine the sounds of the Mag Men were. I am amazed at how well their work has held up over time.
5,One of the Best!!,"I must have seen the ""Men"" a hundred times at the Raven in Harrisburg in those years, and they were even better live than in this marvelous CD. The first song I ever heard them do was Eddie Holman's ""This Can't Be True,"" which blew my mind and made me a soul music fan for life. Both Buddy & Dave were incredible singers, but if you listen closely here you will hear that the third star was Bob Angelucci's drumming, which elevated some very good songs to soul music greatness.Don't even hesitate----if you even moderately like 60's soul you will love this CD!"
4,Spooky! by EU from North Boulevard,"I reviewed the book Old Willd Place. I rated it four stars because it was very spooky and was about real ghosts! The only thing I would change is the ending with the old mean lady. The story is about two kids that have ""something bad"" happen to them and they have rules to follow. You don't really figure out the bad thing until the middle of the book. It was a very different way to tell a ghost story. Don't read it at night! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves ghost stories, probably ages 10 and up."
5,The best book ever,I could read this book 1000 times and not get tired of it. If you like a spooky book read this one!
4,Thought provoking,"Have you wanted to go into the old house at the end of the road? Have you walked through the woods and heard footsteps in the leaves behind you? Have you sat on a bench in the fall sunshine and heard a sigh beside you? Have you wondered about spirits that may lurk around you? Have you stared at a pale, thin figure with dark, wide eyes and thought...real or dead? You will thoroughly enjoy this book of dead children, banshee screaming dead old lady, murder, snakes and creepy broken houses. A quick read...but best done in the day!"
4,Great ghost story,"Lissa Morrison is a young girl who comes to live with her father as caretakers of the old Willis place, a run-down country house at the edge of the woods. Diana and Georgie Eldrige have been living in those woods for many years and Diana is excited that the new caretaker has a girl just her age to be friends with. But things aren't as they seem and the old Willis place keeps a very dark secret which Lissa must discover for the sake of her new friends. Can she help them before it's too late?Very well written and suspenseful. A highly enjoyable read."
2,written for younger people,I didn't realize it was for what I would call the Pepsi Generation. I tossed it after about ten pages.
4,"Diana,Georgie,Lissa and Miss Lillian","Diana and her little brother Georgie live on a farm.Not in a nice warm cozy house with there parents,in a shed,in the woods,completly alone!But they use to live in a nice warm cozy house with there parents,but then the bad thing happened!So now they survive by them selfs.Some parts of this story are very spinechilling,other parts are sad,and the entire story is wonderful!"
5,Smooth!,"Buy it! This is a sweet blade. The price is scary. The lower tooth count raises questions. The reality is it is the best general purpose blade. The price is in line with the performance it delivers. (Maybe the price should be higher to indicate the quality!) The tooth count, well who care how many teeth it has, it the results that count!"
3,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews and waiting for the right project, I was disappointed in the way the Woodworker II blade burned Brazilian Cherry from the very first cut. Thinking there might be something wrong with this particular blade, I purchased a second one at a local woodworkers' store. The result was the same. My Freud blades performed better but were both dull by the time we unveiled the new stairs and railing. I saved hours of sanding by giving up on the Woodworker II. It may be the best blade in the world for certain applications. If you have one of those, buy it. If you want to rip hard woods that burn easily, consider an alternative."
5,Nice blade.,"Cuts are not glassy smooth, but they're much better than those from the relatively cheap Oldham blade that I had previously. -has too many teeth for ripping hard maple--tends to burn. I'd buy another."
5,A whole new level of quality!!!,"I am getting ready to build new kitchen cabinets and I realized I needed to upgrade a few things in the shop first. I built a cabinet for my bathroom (out of cherry) and was consistently getting burns on the wood - and I knew I had to do something with the blade as everything else on the saw was dialed-in. I had been using a freud and it did me fine for a number of years but I had read enough to know Forrest was the top end blade. I bit the bullet and ordered the WWII and WOW! Ran some scrap cherry through and the cut WAS like it had already been finished - I wouldn't have had to do ANYTHING and what a huge time saving that will be. Turned around and ordered the Chopmaster for the new Milwaukee miter saw I just bought also! I hated spending all that money but each item was worth every penny (plus some)! Anyone considering this purchase, that enjoys making sawdust even a little, I would tell you to just do it! You really won't regret it!"
3,slightly dissapointed,"I finally decided to buy the ""Cadillac"" of saw blades. When it arrived I was concerned with it's ""used"" apperance. I examined the carbide and the teeth were all very sharp and had plenty of carbide. I guess I expected better from all I had read about Forrest blades. Here are the results. 1) Severe tear out on the bottom of Maple plywood while using a zero clearance insert. 2) Burns 3/4"" thick Maple easily if there is the slightest hesitation during feed rate. 3) leaves saw marks on the sides of all solid woods ripped, from pine to hard Maple. The blade I was using prior to the purchase of this was a glue line rip Freud. In my opinion it was a superior product. Forrest blades can be re-sharpened more often but that does not make up for the lack of quality results. All the blades I use are used in the same saw, same fence, same inserts etc.In my opinion I will buy the Freud again next time."
5,George Lewis's mind is quite finite.,"I bought the JET 708100 JWTS-10 WorkShop 10-Inch 1-1/2 Horsepower Contractor Saw from Amazon. I loved the saw, although the blade was awful for the finish type work I usually am accustomed to performing. I had always heard that the Forrest blades were the best, and after several hundred cuts (still sharp) I agree. The lack of splintering on a piece of ply is amazing for a 40 tooth blade. Highly recommended, will save you money in long run due to quality and versatility.*In reference to my title, the George Lewis negative review about how the saw blade was a rip off because of lack of diamonds is what is wrong with the world. The Amazon price on this blade is a great value for the moderate to professional woodworker."
3,Can't say I know what all the fuss is about.,"There is nothing to complain about with this blade, but I say save your money. The difference between this and the $60 Freud I was using prior is barely noticeable."
5,"Wonderful, Awesome Product","This is the cream of of the crop, top of the heap, A Number 1, superb blade. It cuts as well as everyone says. This blade is noticeably stiffer than the blade this replaced. UPDATE: I've now cut 1000+ linear feet of hardwoods with this blade. The cuts are awesome!! Not a single machine mark! Boards are ready for glue up. No need to make a stop at the jointer. I'd give this 6 stars if I could!"
4,Very nice but unforgiving.,"When cutting hard maple this blade will give you cuts as smooth as glass as long as the wood does not wander even a few thousandths away from the rip fence otherwise it will burn the wood. So as long as you are perfect..it is perfect. It is a very good blade but it is not as ""forgiving"" as other blades I have used over the years. If you use a dial indicator (or other methods) to assure your fence is parallel to the blade, and you feed it perfectly or use featherboards, you will be impressed with the quality of the edge it leaves. On crosscuts it leaves a really nice edge with only the very slightest fuzzy which will fall off with a touch of your finger leaving a perfect edge. I bought the blade because of all the ""hype"" I have heard about it over the years and although I like the blade very much, it may be a bit more expensive than other blades that will do a similar job."
5,Well worth the money in my opinion!!!!,"I had recently bought a Jet 3hp table saw and also bought the WWII blade...I was so impressed with the quality of the cut that I went out and bought the 12"" Chopmaster and the 8"" dado....I recommend their blades to anyone that I've encountered...I only use these blades for the better grades of wood...for cutting up 2X I'll use some Freud blades which do fine for that purpose but don't even come close to the Forrest Blades...For those of you that have burning problems...you must not have your table saw set up right...cause I cannot see how you could be burning your wood on cuts when I don't experience this nor do a whole bunch of other people...Get the Forrest Blades you won't regret it..."
5,Cuts like butter,"Using this blade in a Jet Contractor's saw. I expected some improvement due to the great reviews and write-ups I've seen on this saw but was just plain amazed at the difference right from the first cut. I was using a Freud glueline blade, and still having some burning in hard maple. Tried changing the speed of feed, and continually checked the blade alignment. Finally I decided to spend the extra $$ and try this blade. I am not sorry and will be hard won to try any other blades. I'm thinking now of eventually upgrading my chop saw blade, and even the dado set to replace the one I have. Nothing less than superb!"
5,Just for Fun,"Immediately after installing this blade I shaved a paper thin slice off of a piece of 3/4"" ash. I'm talking a piece thinner than a lightweight business card. The cut was glass smooth with absolutely no tearing.This is an extremely impressive blade."
5,Smoooooth ...Splinter free....cuts,"This blade truely is outstanding. For a combination blade, it does everything very well. The resulting cuts are very high quality. Rip cuts and cross cuts in hardwood, softwood and plywood all come out smooth and splinter free.I've used mine on several projects and it's still very sharp and yields great cuts. I expect that in the near furure, I'll have to send it back to Forrest for a quality sharpening. So, I bought another Woodworker II for backup."
2,Don't hit any knots,"I bought one of these Forrest blades about 15 years ago after seeing a demonstration at a woodworkers show in Portland, OR. I was very impressed with the demo, but about the fifth time I used it the tips flew into dozens of pieces when it hit a knot in some cherry wood. I threw it away and have not bought any Forrest blades since.On the other hand, I am very impressed with the 12 inch Rigid blade that came with my Rigid miter saw. The cross cuts are truly as smooth as if sanded with fine sandpaper, even after extended use."
3,OH WHAT A BEAUTY!,"I have had this blade for nearly a year now so I can fairly rate it. unless I got a lemon, I can't see what everybody is raving about, yes it cuts smooth but I don't get the mirror finish I read about, it seems to run out a bit more than they claim and so far the thing it does most is burn, burn and more burn! it doesn't matter what you cut or how fast you can push it!, I've run philly mahogany, cocobolo, coyote, oak, pine, bubinga, zebra, you name it and I've burned it!, needless to say it is probably the least used blade in the arsenal. if you don't mind changing blades alot you can dimension and then thin trim for a smooth glueable edge, it won't burn as bad on an 1/8"" cut. but if you have to use the jointer you might as well save money on your blades. I was stoked when this blade came in and now I can stoke my wood stove with the waste.in my opinion the only people proud of this blade are the people that get a hundred dollars for it!, hats off to ya, great marketing!"
2,BEWARE,"BEWARE OF THIS BLADE. IT IS A KICKER!! Yes, the blade cuts like butter. However, their is absolutely no anti-kickback protection.I just broke two fingers using this blade to rip 1/4"" pine on a properly set-up Delta Contractors Saw. I've never had any problems on this saw with the less expensive combo blades with anti kickback. This blade has been a kicker from day one. For me, it's coming off and going into the trash can. If you do buy this blade, make sure you spend the extra several hundred dollars to buy a good anti-kickback protection system."
1,Great Blade - Poor Retailing,"Forrest blades are great. Have been using them for years and love them. This blade arrived on time but had been previously opened and the package closed again with tape. The blade was rusty, covered with sandy gunk and some of the blade teeth were protruding through the wax covering. One of the teeth appeared damaged (the carbide tip). Sent this blade right back to Amazon and ordered one from Rockler."
4,Seriously funky.,"Combined rythm, funk, and carribean grooves make this one an essential for the collection. Very, very, funky baby."
5,Best sign language book for students,"I have been taking ASL for the past year, and this is by far one of the best books I have seen. It shows the difference between signs for ASL, Signed English, etc. I have checked this book out of our local library three times, and now have decided to buy it for myself. It includes many signs for words that have multiple meanings, and explains the difference for each. I highly recommend this book."
3,Not what I expected!,"Book is hard to follow. A lot of names, need an index at beginning to keep track. Story does not flow. Certainly not as well written as many other books of this type."
4,Baby tent,"We got this tent specifically for the beach since our pediatrician recommended we don't use sunblock until baby is 6 months. Until now, we were taking our big, bulky, adult camping tent and setup was a huge hassel. This play tent is simple to setup and it does block the sun very well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the velcro closures are cheap and the netting is very thin. Our baby is stil little, immobile and not able to pull on the tent material. I am sure he will be able to bust out of this easily once he can pull himself up and push."
3,Good quality for a toddler tent,"I did a bit of research before I purchased this tent as well as read quite a few reviews. I finally settled on this. I promptly took it camping with us after recieving, It was handy for play reasons and is extremely durable. I would compare it to a cheaper version of an adult tent for quality sake. My only complaint would be that there's no way to zip the tent, lack of a zipper. Instead it seals with three strips of velcro, which doesn't work well when your camping. I would have liked to zip it. For this reason we mainly use this tent to keep goods such as food, or other camping items. It's not waterproof, but I hadn't expected it to be. It would be appropriate for a play toy as one would purchase it for."
4,Kids love it,My 6 mth old and 2 year old love this tent. There is enough room for them and it is great for the beach.
2,i would prefer a bigger tent,"We thought a smaller tent would be ideal for a baby, but in actuality you need a bigger tent so you can also be inside with him/her at all times. Also this tent provides barely any releif from the sun at the beach.Overall its not a bad tent, just not practical for most situations. Reccomendation: get a sligtly bigger ten."
2,Piece of Crap,"This broke before we ever got to use it. Was annoying and difficult to put together. Really small to!! SAve you money, but the big one that shades the whole family."
4,Surprisingly tasty!,"A friend made me pancakes out of this mix when we came over for a ""breakfast for dinner"" night--and I was surprised by how normal they tasted! Now, granted, it's not wheat--but it's not bad. Even the husband liked them, and he's quite picky about GF cooking (we've been burned in the past). It's nicer than having to buy the individual flours and mix them yourselves, and the flavors blended nicely--and no gritty bean flours!"
2,Bad aftertaste,"I have been gluten free for almost ten years, and this is probably # 5 in the top ten worst substitutes I have ever tried. It had a weird, bitter aftertaste that was very prevalent in the waffles, not as much in the sweeter coffee cake but still very off-putting. Also, the cake batter was too thick to pour and I had to smear it into the pan. Hodgson Mill needs to change this produce or lose it all together. It is sad because I love their gluten free oats, buckwheat cereal, flax seed, baking powder, xanthan gum, etc. I would try Pamela's multi-purpose baking mix, it tastes more like the real thing."
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"A BAD mix from a GOOD company. Hodgson Mills makes many good products. This IS NOT one of them. It is NOT the ""gluten free"" version of Bisquick or any other quick baking mix. There is nothing quick about this. All that is in this product is a few varieties of Gluten free flours. There is no sugar, baking powder, baking soda, egg, guar or xanthan gum (nothing to hold the finished product together for those of you who are new to Gluten Free Baking). Items you try to make with this mix as is will fall apart and taste bad. In other words, this is a mix you HAVE to experiment with in order to make things come out looking or tasting good at all. Most of us who have to eat Gluten Free foods are looking for shortcuts like every other busy person on the planet. This mix will add to your busy time, not relieve you. Try Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix or the Gluten Free Pantry Baking Mix for a better experience."
2,Bitter aftertaste with chocolate chip cookies,"Being new to GF cooking, I purchased this recipe to make my GF toddler the chocolate chip cookies from the recipe on the box. The consistency is fine but there's a very bitter aftertaste. When a two year old doesn't even finish one cookie, you know something is wrong! it may be better in other recipes, but I don't recommend the chocolate chip cookies."
5,The best,"My wife and I are vegan and she has celiac so that leaves a lot of baking to be done at home. This flour mix doesn't have a ton of garbanzo flour like a lot of the others, and if you've baked with that before you know it leaves a slightly bitter taste, no matter how sweet of a pastry you've made.There's not much else to say about an all purpose flour, but if you have celiac or avoid wheat/gluten this is the best one we've found for flavor and ability to mix."
5,Excellent with the right recipes,"I received this baking mix as a gift, and I tried it with a soft and chewy molasses cookie recipe. I shared the cookies with a mixed group of friends: some that have to eat gluten-free some that do not. They all loved the cookies and no one mentioned any bitter after taste that another reviewer mentioned. I would recommend these for dark breads, cookies, and cakes, of the spice variety, such as banana bread, zucchini bread, molasses cookies, gingerbread cookies, carrot cake etc. This works well for dark colored doughs and should work well to bake a gluten-free alternative to whole wheat bread. I would NOT recommend this for light and fluffy buttermilk pancakes, white cakes, or other baked goods where a few simple flavoring ingredients like chocolate chips or peanut butter need to shine through. For the right application, this is a whole grain, healthy, easy-to-use gluten-free alternative to traditional flour mixes."
4,DVD - Playing house,"This item arrived timely and in good condition. I saw this movie on TV and and thought it was cute. I mostly attracted the actors in the film.I haven't actually viewed the DVD yet, so cannot comment on the quality."
2,Standard T-bolt clamp,Nut and threads are weak as compared to Murray brand. But if strength isn't what you need it works fine.
5,Great Help for IEP,"The COACH was a great help in putting together my daughter's IEP. By following the quidelines you are able to organize and decide what is most important to your child and you when planning the IEP. COACH. also, is a big proponent of inclusion which is what parents of special needs children are wanting. Using its format you can plan a very workable education plan and the child can be educated in a regular classroom the majority of the time. We have been doing IEP's for years but using COACH made this years IEP much easier."
5,Excellent quick reference tool,"This JCL publication has all the parameters and statements most often used. The book also presents the most efficient and effective means to code the most common JCL parameters and statements. Olivia Carmandi hit the bullseye, writing a book that contains practical day to day answers in an easy to use format and size, an appealing tool to the busy IS professional.This is an outstanding book that addresses and responds to the needs of its target audience in a very time efficient, practical, and helpful manner. Five stars."
4,Board Buddies Track,I purchased two 12 inch tracks with a set of Board Buddies (yellow). They work well on my router fence and table saw fence. They make it easy to switch the hold down parts between machines. My table saw has a 8 1/4 blade so the 12 inch track is long enough. Saws with larger blades would require the 24 inch track.

4,Excellent Book on Welsh Witchcraft Ritual,"Although this is an excellent book on Welsh Witchcraft Ritual, I am slightly disappointed in its treatment of Druidic ritual. I can see that the author knows his stuff, but he didn't expand on his brief description of The Druids and their Rituals, it sort of left me hanging and wanting more. Is the author going to re-publish this book. My copy is a little worn. Is he going to revise it so that it includes more Druidry? I like the druid section on their web page: http://www.tylwythteg.com/druid1.htmlAll in all a very good book."
1,who are you kidding,It would probably help him if he actually knew anything about these countries. My dog knows more about Celts. This is full of ridiculous claims unsupported by any sort of evidence. The author simply selects what he likes and can cope with and rejects the rest. It's funny reading but if you are after truth buy a real book. Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd
1,Make your own,I made my own inserts from a railroad car window which is half inch thick polycarbonate. They fit and work very well and didn't cost a cent.
1,Dreadful!,"I cannot hear what others seem to in these badly recorded (seems that the performances were from 1974, with one in 1967, according to the box, and some of what I so dislike may be due to bad engineering and microphone placement -- but that's hard to credit for everything that's wrong here), listlessly mis-performed, flat out bad intepretations of the string quintets. One would think that these works were meant primarily for solo violin with ""back-up."" Nonsense! Penguin Guide complimented these players' performances as ""admirably conceived."" I have no idea what that means. Played this way these wonderful works would rapidly find their way to the trash heap (as my set of these performances will today). How can the simply overwhelming G-Minor be played so badly? I grew up on versions from the Julliard Sting Quartet (with a fifth -- Trampler, I think) on LP and went to this set hoping for better. I will continue my search."
2,"Extraordinary performance of No. 5, Atrocious sound. Violins wrong side.","I have never heard such a good preformance of ANY string quartet or quintet. Rating each movement from 1 poor to 5 I have never before rated such a recording 5 5 5 5.The treble on all these recordings is so distorted to be almost unlistonable. Also the louds are usually far too load sounding nothing as they do in in a live performance. The parts of the other performances I could stand hearing to the end had much poorer performances, perhaps Mozart's fault since many of the themes are trivial and repeat endlessly. Over half the quartet recordings in my large collection have the violins on the wrong side. This does not bother me now since,having biwireable speakers, I have the B speakers reversed. Absent such speakers banana plugs can be quickly changed but that is a big bother. Otherwise, listen with headphones."
3,Convenient but my foot slides too far in,"This thong is comfortable and casual but I feel like my foot slides too far in, leaving a gap at the back although it should be my size."
3,first stoner/doom band,"I'm looking for all the cd's of the great cult bands like st.vitus,obsessed,count raven,they had a contract with sst records and hellhound.st.vitus is one of the greatest doom bands i ever heard The cd's are very hard to find"
5,Exceptional History of this Railroad,"John Signor, the author of this excellent history, is a well-known author of books on the Southern Pacific railroad and is currently the editor of both the Southern Pacific Historical and Technical Society's journal ""SP Trainline"" and the Union Pacific Historical Society's journal ""The Streamliner"". All of his books are comprehensive, informative, well-written, and illustrated with hundreds of interesting period photos. This book is the best reference available on its subject and is a 'must have' for anyone interested in the LA&SL; Railroad, its history, or its operations. Related titles include:Donner Pass, Southern Pacific's Sierra CrossingTehachapi, Southern Pacific - Santa FeRails in the Shadow of Mount Shasta: 100 Years of Railroading Along Southern Pacific's Shasta DivisionSouthern Pacific's Coast LineBeaumont Hill, Southern Pacific's Southern California Crossing"
3,This is the 81206F model not the 81206P model,"If you are looking for the new 120 tooth ratchet, this is not it. They ship the 81206F model which is 84 tooth vs the new 120 tooth model. They really need to make the ad more clear. I was really looking forward to giving the 120 tooth set to my mechanic father in-law ... shoot"
5,Great,Great product - I love the price and the quality of this product. I am working on a variety of projects and love these little brushes for so many things!
1,Cheap Item,Pass on this one. Immediately sent back once I saw how the featherboard is held in the miter slot. I coould easilly snap it in 2 with little pressure. Got a magnetic version that works great - but much more $$$.
2,"Push block and stick are fine, featherboard stinks",I'll keep this short and sweet. The pushstick and pushblock are fine. The featherboard is garbage.
1,Half a Star,"I rate this half-a-star simply because it was a 'set' as advertised. That is the only thing the manufacturer/distributor got right. The push block and the stick can be made at home for cents. The featherboard mounting system is a total failure. There is no way you can lock the featherboard to the table slot and have it be a reliable, working accessory. I'm amazed this set is still offered for sale. In my opinion, the loose and unreliable featherboard is quite possiblly an accident waiting to happen. Not mine. It is at the landfill."
2,"Cheesy, even for the money","This package may seem like an inexpensive bargain, but the items are all inferior, even in light of the price. The featherboard, in particular, is virtually useless. Given that, 7.50 each for a cheesy (and short, relative to a 10' table saw blade) push stick and block is kind of stiff.I advise you to take a little extra time and find the individual components you need for what you are doing. This may be easier in a venue that contains a greater selection of woodworking items, or you could make them..."
1,Junk! Junk! Junk! - You get what you pay for!,"The featherboard was complete junk. I was able to 'assemble' it, and inserted it into the slot on my table saw. Each time I was about to run stock past it, it would come undone, come unassembled, or just not do what it was supposed to.If you buy this set, you will end a mediocre push block, and stick. The ones I have made from hardwoods are way better than these."
1,Useless,Agree with other reviewers - featherboard is a useless and dangerous piece of junk - should be removed from market.
1,Junk Product,"Received it as a gift - like most reviewers I agree that the screws are wrong, they don't fit the slot properly and make it difficult to insert the slider into the table guide. I will probably throw it away and not dissapoint my daughter.Also one of the turn-screw threads was filled with plastic - took me fifteen minutes to clean it out enough to thread it on.The push stick is rounded slick plastic and I would have to put some rubber or something on the end of it before trying to use it.The cheap plastic has sharp edges and must be trimmed and cleaned up for any sustained use.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT"
1,Cheap plastic,"If I had seen this in a store I would not have bought it. Feather board will not prevent kickback, does not lock securly into the miter slot. pass this one up make your own."
1,miter guage review,"This is probably one of the poorest made table saw accessory I have ever seen. I purchased it to replace the gauge that came with my craftsman saw only to find that it was worse. It is cheaply made, fits together poorly and will not hold an angle. (bump it, and the slop in the pivot allows it to move about 3 degrees). The only redeeming feature is the hold down, which is a good idea, but it doesn't work. The adjuster slips under moderate pressure and will allow the work to come loose or shift. If you're a SWMBO buying one for your spouse, just make sure you insure the heck out of him first!"
3,Needed Work,"The slide bar was to tall for the grove in my table saw, There was a 1/16"" gap under the miter on both sides, I ended up having to use the old bar from the original miter gauge that had broke, I used the Woodstock's slide for a template for the old slide, Drilled and tapped the holes I needed to mount the Woodstock miter gauge to my old slide, I then had to make 2 custom spacer washers for the pivot point screw and the adjuster knob for setting the angles, Now the updated unit sits perfectly flat on the table with no play whatsoever.Now the Woodstock works great."
2,Read the library's copy.,"A better title might be ""Why You Won't Get a Job in a Big Firm Unless You're Perfect."" The book does a good job of describing what law firms are looking for, but spends very little time telling you how to get one of the jobs available. Written by a former recruiting coordinator at Baker & McKenzie, its purpose seems to be to make recruiters' jobs easier by discouraging anyone other than the best of the best from applying at all. Read the library's copy if you must, then turn to ""Guerrilla Tactics for Finding the Legal Job of Your Dreams"" by Kimm Alayne Walton for some serious advice"
2,"Should be ""How To Get a Job on a Law *Farm*""","Apparently, if the firm has less than 200 lawyers, it's not a ""law firm"" according to this author. This despite the fact that 90% of all legal jobs out there are in smaller firms. Go figure."
3,Decent resource,"While I thought this book was decent, there are other guides to law firms that provide a better inside view of each firm's hiring process. One good example: The Vault Reports Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms."
4,Christmas-y and adorable,"I bought this as a gift for my best friend and she really loved it. I bought a set of snow men for myself and they are adorable to. I wish I had purchased one of the bears for myself as well. They play a cute Christmas tune and move and ""dance"" along. Great gift idea."
4,Cute Christmas decoration!,"For the price that I paid, it was very well worth it. Animated with sound, our younger grandchildren, ages 3, 4, & 7 would watch it over and over. Very cute!"
1,Complete Organ Concertos,I find this recording a little insipid. There is no doubt that there are better recordings of the Handel organ conceertos.
5,RIOT SOUNDS!!,"The soundtrack to a backstairs revolution which will scare your parents but will probably die at the first hurdle. But that shouldn't stop you trying, right??!!! More astounding sexy tunes from the mighty Alec, the late Carl Crack and the eternally hoarse and disturbingly seductive Hanin Elias (whose solo album is also superb), not that the others are not of course (too much eyeliner). ATR have continued to be a breath of fresh ox in the constant pollution of newspeak bull we seem to be fed constantly! The news of the banning of this album in Germany is particlarly disturbing! As a huge DHR fan myself I can't say this is my favourite, but tracks like ""Destroy 200 years of culture' are simply of classic status in popular music, of a much needed kind in this Celine Dion obsessed mire of flatline chaff. Electrocute the mainstream! Buy Future of War!!! And wear lots of shiny black clothes!!Check out EC8OR too, (with the disturbingly seductive Gina V. D'Orio !!!)DIGITAL HARDCORE!!!"
4,great comparison of contrasting leaderships,"Excellent comparison of the way leaders should lead compared to the way current day ""leaders"" think they should lead. It is exciting to see scrpture brought back into the work place. All true leaders shuld read this book. Not only on what to do but what not to do."
4,hobbies,Item works its what I needed. Every think was explained. I wish I could tell morehow much can you say about a featherbroad.
1,Junk,"The majority of the reviewers have called this one right. It's junk! Don't waste your money. The one I purchased had issues from the start. The greatest of which is that one of the adjustment knobs does not hold tight. Upon inspection, I quickly saw why. The knob has a mickey mouse set up consisting of a phillips head screw in a plastic chase. As you try to tighten the knob, the theory is that the screw will remain in place as the knob threads down the shaft and snugs the plastic adjustment arm. It works, sort of, with one knob. However, on the other knob, the screw simply spins. Solution?.....remove featherboard with your strong hand and hurl directly at nearest trash receptacle!"
1,I was sorry to see it was made in America,"I received my Big Horn 'Deluxe' Featherboard today. It was missing one knob. Both slots where the 3/16"" bolts ride were heat warped so that the bolts would not slide from side to side. The feathers were also heat warped from the manufacturing process. Someone spent a lot of time and energy to refine the plastic chemicals, create a mold and build a machine to injection mold these things, assemble 2 bolts, 2 plastic locks and in my case one knob, bubble warp it with a pre-printed cardboard back and send it off to internet marketer, where I ordered it, someone picked it off a shelf and packed it in a box and after 3 days of shipping, it arrived at my door to end up in my recycle bin after a useless life of 5 minutes. It's of a quality one expected from Tiawan 40 years ago. I was sorry to see it was made in America."
2,Threw Them Away After a Few Uses,"I purchased these featherboards because I just wanted something ""simple"" for my router table. What a mistake!As you tighten the screws, the plastic bends and gets cut up. After just a few uses, it's all worn out. When you try to slide this featherboard inside the miter slot, it bends and twists. They have a sloppy fit inside a standard miter slot, which actually makes them dangerous, because they can slide around during a cut.The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they are cheap."
1,A piece of junk,"I unpacked it, I inspected it, and I immediately repacked it for return. It was either heat damaged or extremely poorly made, the feathers are so flimsy that I was afraid to use it. The screws that are supposed to tighten the the tool in the ""T"" slot was so tight in the threaded knob that I could not tighten without the screw spinning. Shame on Amazon for selling such poor quality."
2,Look for an Alternative....,"The price seems good, but it's still not worth it. Product is flimsy and poorly made. I bought it for use with a Craftsman table saw and it will not fit into the slots in any useful way. The slopy fit probally makes this product dangerous."
