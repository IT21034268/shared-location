1,"Too, too bad","Very dark, dreary movie. Must have been cut in half and quartered because it did not tie together well. Obsessed and Overdone with nudity and sex."
2,Crappy Story + Naked Meg Ryan = YEAH!,"What was this story about? I can't remember! What I do remember is a very cute Meg Ryan completely naked...and for a 60 year old she is put together extremely well. What was that 16 Candles quote...""Perky!""Not for kids. YEAH!!"
4,Pretty good movie but creepy,"I saw this movie last October and liked it. Meg Ryan is definitely starting to show her age (after watching ""When Harry Met Sally""). ... I think the first time since ""The Doors"". Jennifer Jason Leigh plays her sister in which something horrible happens to her (finds her head in a sink). Anyway, the movie was good but don't know what this director's cut will be like. Will have to rent it."
2,In The Cut,"NOT Meg Ryan's finest,women are great,but maybe not as directors!(Jane Campion)Reminiscent of Eastwoods Tightrope.Seedy Lower Manhattan,and girlhood fraternity with sex workers well portrayed but already well done many times before.Afficianados of Ms Ryan's range of acting skills will be duly pleased.Police role somewhat as a cliche,ending cuts short and ill defined.Another art house effort."
2,"A boring, poorly-made movie","Meg Ryan is Frannie, an English teacher in New York who gets pulled into a murder investigation when the head of a young woman is found in her garden. As she deals with an old boyfriend who won't leave her alone and with her neurotic, damaged sister, she falls into a charged sexual relationship with the detective investigating the killing. More bodies appear and Frannie has reason to be suspicious that the cop she is attracted to is the killer.In the Cut is a dull movie. The mystery of the killer's identity is spread out so thinly over the whole movie, there is no suspense when you figure out who it is. The sex scenes between Ryan and Ruffalo are gloomy and forced. I didn't believe the supposed attraction between the two. There are a lot of arty set pieces in the film to try and trick you into thinking there is some important subtext here, but there isn't. It's just a boring, poorly-made movie."
1,The Worst Film in Years!!!!,"If I could give this film zero stars, I would do it without hesitation.""In the Cut"" is unoriginal, unintelligent, and disgusting.In a quest to prove that she is more than just America's sweetheart, Meg Ryan fails miserably as Frannie, a character that you just care nothing about.The usually terrific Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Jason Leigh are suprisingly limp as Frannie's cop boyfriend and beloved sister, respectively.How could Jane Campion, who brought us such masterpieces as ""The Piano"", ""An Angel at my Table"", and ""Holy Smoke"", make such a steaming piece of crap?[...]Stay away at all costs!"
1,Astoundingly Bad,"I guess this is supposed to be an erotic thriller. Meg Ryan has some fairly intense lovemaking scenes and appears nude, so maybe the term ""erotic"" fits. There's not a single thrill in this movie, however. The characters are flat, undeveloped, lifeless, uninteresting and not particularly likeable. The story is laughable -- disjointed, dull, uninteresting ... You get the picture. How this ""story"" ever made it to the screen is beyond belief, but I guess it should encourage anyone interested in being a screenwriter -- if this sold, anything will sell. This really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad ones."
3,"Okay movie, but Meg Ryan looks good","The movie by itself is really nothing special. Honestly, by the end I really didn't care about how it ended. The one bright spot is the perfomance by Meg Ryan. She really pushed herself and showed more acting chops than I assumed she had. This is not the Meg Ryan were used to. She wasn't perky and spunky like she is in other movies but the way she plays down the role proves that somtimes less is more. Those sad eyes and pouty lips left me with a strange mix of arousal and sympathy. By the end of the moive I just wanted to give her a hug and hold her in my arms.The love scene is not as graphic as other reviewers seem to think. I thought it was sweet and tasteful. Bottem line, rent this movie or buy it cheap because its good enough to watch once."
2,"what about ""in the butt""","I was very disappointed with this. It had rave reviews for Meg Ryan, which I must admit,for her as an actress this was very different for her. She pulled it off really well. But as for the movie,give it a miss. Jennifer Jason Leigh (whom I loved in The Hitcher and Single White Female) does herself no favours by saying yes to this role. Meg Ryan acts very well. If you're a fan then this movie is good. The ending is abit of a shock but the story is not thrilling, it's not intense, it's worth a miss."
1,"""In the Cut"" belongs IN THE TOILET","A good director, a good cast... how could they have messed this one up? Apparently, the producers of this movie were unaware that it's important in movies to have stuff actually HAPPEN. ""In the Cut"" is one of the most idiotic, most predictable, and most fatally boring movies I've ever seen. And unlike the so-bad-it's-funny-as-hell ""Killing me Softly,"" this movie is just terrible in a very ordinary way. Ugh."
3,"Predictable, though unusual","Maybe the full frontal of Meg Ryan and a little of Mark Ruffalo is what puts some off here. I found it a breath of fresh air, compared with most Hollywood thrillers. It's the usual murder mystery, and you know that all the red herrings put before us are just that, until the end, until the real killer is revealed as the one with the least amount of screen time. It was refreshing to see perky Meg Ryan looking her age here, though she reverts to her old self in the extra feature. No more baggy eyes and mousy hair and sagging breasts. Jennifer Jason Leigh, as far as I know, plays her real crazy self here. I have seen Mark Ruffalo in a number of his films and I really appreciate his acting. Very subtle. Kevin Bacon's small role as a rejected boyfriend who is losing his mind is actually the scariest thing in the movie. The soundtrack helps us know when to be scared and when not. This is off the beaten path for these people, so for that reason it's worth watching."
4,"Very riviting, dark and exciting","Watching Meg Ryan and Mark Ruffalo is worth the price of admission. It is a dark tale with sad people, but it is spellbinding and the performances of these two people are extraordinary. He is so dangerously sexy and she is not like anything we have ever seen in her before. In many scenes she looked like Nicole Kidman who was originally slated for the role and is credited as one of the producers. The book was complicated and Jane Campion does a very good job of bringing it to life."
2,"Meg, you need a new agent!","I wish I could say this was a good film. I happen to like watching Meg Ryan. I wanted it to be good. I won't complain about the film style. I won't complain about the acting. I won't even complain about the direction....and maybe I should. No, this movie's largest trouble is in story. You could sum up the story in two sentences. Okay, maybe three, if your middle sentence is a two word sentence fragment: ""gratuitous sex"". The writing is weak. The characters are either underdeveloped, or their decisions are unfathomable. I felt like it was two in the morning and I was watching a ""B"" movie on Skinamax. I'm sorry Meg....if I had it to do all over again, I'd rewatch Prelude to a Kiss or When Harry Met Sally. Please forgive me, I tried."
1,...doesn't make the cut,The cinematography was great. That's the nicest thing I can say about this film. There was just no reason to like any of the characters. The gratuitous sex and nudity was slimy. I think they were going for gritty...but it was just a waste of time.
4,Hated the book,"Because I hated the book, I was curious to see how they would make it into a film. Then I learned Jane Campion was directing, and was intrigued. Halfway through, I still wasn't impressed, but I waited. There is a quiet beauty to the film. The way Campion captures small details, like the way the protagonist would see them. I think it would have been horrible if it was completely true to the book. The additions are what make this film. The poetry in the subway. The garden outside her window. Meg Ryan playing against type. Mark Ruffalo is wonderful in his role, not giving the end away. And I loved the ending. I felt unresolved at the end of the book, and this ending made me happy.This movie is not for everyone. There is a lot of gore, and violence, and sex, but I think it was done well. But, I think attention was payed to the important things in the character's life. In some ways, I like it more every time I see it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,STUPID!! I REALLY LIKE MEG RYAN & WAS SHOCKED SHE WOULD PLAY IN SUCH A STUPID MOVIE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!
3,The Truth Cuts,"Look. We all wanted to see Meg Ryan without her clothes on. So here you are. Enjoy.Is it a good movie? Who cares! Your years of waiting are over. Yes. That is right.... Meg is Nude. Praise the angels on high. Its time to rejoice.The movie pretty much sucks. Live with it. Yet bottom line, the pay off is worth the price of admission. Was there any other point to making this movie other than to see Meg topless? I think not, my friend."
1,Shouldn't have made the final cut.,"Let me break it down for you in a nutshell, people. It's a murder mystery in which the film's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is. But, she has her doubts. But she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy's arm. He has the same thing. But what does she do? She has sex with him. Sex, sex, and more sex. If you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him? Plus, 50% of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk. I don't think this was a perfectly planned movie, to tell you the truth.Final Verdict: It's easily forgetable and needs to go right before it starts."
2,Interesting but falls short,"This movie has a dark, seething style and seems to be going somewhere or saying something, but devolves into a standard direct-to-late-night-HBO slasher movie ending. Meg Ryan, however, gives an interesting performance, with her usual hyper-cuteness suppressed."
2,DIRRRTY movie!!!!,"Oh my goodness! My jaw dropped when I saw this movie.I believe that one should be atleast be 21 before endulging one self into this poor excuse for a movie. All this is a sex show. And a BAD one.Trust me, you'll want to CUT your self after or CUT yourself while you watch this ,movie I am fine with the nudity as long as it it is done with in good taste. Coming from me, that is a huge statement. CUT stars rising star, Mark Ruffalo.And he shows all that he can show and so does Meg Ryan. Filled with GRAPHIC and TASTELESS sex scenes, this ""thriller"" or what ever this was intended to partray, I really couldn't tell given that this was basically one of those adult movies and given that this movie had NO plot what-so-ever. Good acting, AWFUL writting,FILTHY dialog and EXTREMELY PERVASIVE language. I Basically as I said prior, this movie is just glorified adult material."
1,yuck,"what a depressing and crude film. this genre of psychological thrillers is really turning into a horror one. so sad that Meg Ryan put herself through this. I'd recommend checking out something uplifting instead. 'Invincible' by Werner Herzog comes to mind - that is very good.And furthermore, isn't it pretty stupid that the villain turns out to have a cop investigating his crimes. If there is any plausibility in this it is never brought to the surface. (There is no plausibility - just a bad storyline.) Also, how stupid of the villain to go after his cop buddy's g/f and her sister. Talk about wanting to get caught. Let's give ourselves a little credit as an audience people and not get sucked into some shoddy stories. Blah."
3,Comment about Ang Poon Kah's review,"If I had read the reviews before seeing the movie, I would be really ticked off with Ang Poon Kah's over-revealing ""review."" Whether or not the plot was predictable was beside the point. You just don't reveal the end of a movie. <sarcasm>Amazon, thanks a lot.</sarcasm>"
2,Don't read this unless you've already seen it,"In The Cut is a sexually flamboyant modern day noir-style thriller with a large sense of eroticism and atmosphere, but very little sense of story progression. Undermining the raunchyness and all the (...) scenes is a fairly boring and uninterersting crime story that literally goes nowhere. I was hoping for a better ending that would've brought meaning to the 60 minutes of scenes that bored me to death. Sure, there would be a a hot scene or two, somebody would get mangeled and then it repeated that for 45 minutes. By the time the 3rd or 4th victim was killed, I really could've cared less about the story of desire and obsession between Frannie and the detective. I just wanted to know what the movie was getting at as far as the killer goes so that the movie would end and I could get on with my life. In the end it would all tie together, but I didn't really care by that time, I just wanted it to be over."
1,Set your sleep timer...,"This is a long, boring, dry film that drags out until the end. Set your sleep timer to about 60mins so that when you doze off you can aleast get a good nap in. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS!!!"
3,legal porno? how far can they go!,"Ok, lets cut to the chase, the unrated dvd is basically porno-most video stores cannot or will not carry this dvd.-In the future Meg should think about what she is doing-she will not win an oscar for what she does here-she needs some grooming tips!What I do not understand is why the studio did not tell the truthabout what they were releasing-alot of video stores had to return this product to their dist.Perhaps in the future we can have some truth in advertising!"
1,Boring and a lack of an interesting plot,"From the beginning I started falling asleep. Couldn't understand from one scene to the next and everybody seemed bored, uninteresting and the story did not make any sense. Is this a thriller or a macabre attempt to create a story that isn't even interesting. Why was her sister killed? Doesn't make any sense. Very dark and very long... Poor effort on every one's part at making this movie interesting."
2,"AN EROTIC ""THRILLER"" WEIGHED DOWN BY ITS OWN DEBAUCHERY","""In the Cut"" is an excruciating ""erotic thriller"" (or that's what it was at least going for) about a college professor who becomes involved with a New York City homicide detective investigating a string of grisly murders.Would have been great to see Meg Ryan change her chick-flick love-comedy stereotype for something more meaningful, but this unnecessarily coarse script isn't it. Not even with the same stylish visual rubric that ""The Piano"" was wrapped in (same director.)Sadly, helped by an unremittingly cheerless script, this urban-noir tale suffocates under the weight of its own self-importance. Sleaze does not make substance, and outright lewd banality cannot be shrugged off under pretense of faux weightiness -- the obvious poverty of this script is still evident through the liberal dose of raunchy sex scenes and pretentious dialogue.May be a worthwhile rental, but I wouldn't cancel any plans for it."
1,If she only had a brain,"Jane Campion continues her brainless quasi-feminist propaganda that like most feminist thinking makes no sense at all. You've seen it all before folks, including an adaptation of ""Portrait of a Lady"" so poisoned by her contempt for men that it makes a nonsense of the women in the story - including the heroine - who like them. And who could forget the complete mess that is ""Holy Smoke""? Even ""The Piano"" was victim feminism 101.When Campion stops making men into nazis from some old war movie she'll make a good movie. She writes like a martian who has never met a human in its life. Forget it!This thriller is entirely unbelievable, and flawed by having no connection with any possible reality whatsoever, except for those who share her prejudices. A total mess. And ugly looking too."
1,"More Perils of Pauline, more Campion Camp","A female director (Campion) and 2 female producers (Parker and Kidman) give us a frank look at some kind of unreal female version of a male fantasy of a sexy slasher movie, whatever that is. Trash talkin'. Plot telegraphin' from the first 10 minutes. You know what the twists will be. Our Pauline just isn't interesting enough. Bad. Baaaaaaad. Desperately seeking sexy without actually being appealing. What were they thinking, if anything?The Piano, at least, had some quirkiness.Yeah, dumb is a good tag for this."
3,Deveoping Meg Ryan's bad girl image,"Along with her movie about boxing (""Against the Ropes"", 2004) this is the movie she chose to change her image from the ""You've Got Mail"" good girl to more of a femme fatale with a strong sexual persona.The flick stars Ryan as the object of desire and Mark Ruffalo as a cop with manly desires. You're supposed to believe Ryan is a teacher than likes to make bad in dark places with police investiagor Ruffalo, who passes on his good boy image too. Both actors are badly miscast in roles they can't carry out because they are both such marshmallows!There's no real sex in this package, just a lot of spontaneous make believe stuff going on in dark corners of ugly buildings. If this was the vehicle that was supposed to turn Meg Ryan into Lena Olin, it didn't work.She seems more comfortable as a sexpot bad girl bitch type in the boxing movie that followed, where she was actually very sexy. Check that one out to see more on her transformation."
1,Lousy Mystery & Thriller,"Save yourself a couple of hours time and 20 bucks. I like thrillers and mysteries a lot, but this one is over the limit. The movie kept dragging and dragging without a meaning.In the first half an hour of the movie, Meg knows about the killer. Strangely though when she discloses it to the detective, all he got to say is ""Come down to downtown"". That is after a couple of murders and the murder suspect (according to Meg) shares something with the detective. Tell me about loop holes.Probably the writer, producer and director thought that a murder mystery with cheap and abundant sex will make this a blockbuster. Well, they were wrong.Bottomline: Save yourself the pain and humiliation and go see some other movie. Heck ANY other movie."
1,Meg Ryan can do better!,"Worst movie that I have ever seen with Meg Ryan, lousy plot and ok acting. Meg, you can do better (and have)!"
1,Truely horrible,"Jane Champion does a wonderful job shooting women alone.Her photography gives Meg Ryan and Jennifer Jayson Leea lovely, languid [attractive] feel.And that's it. This is the only good thing about the movie.The plot, such as it is revolves around the romanticentanglement of Meg Ryan's character Frannie Avereyand Mark Ruffalo's Detective Malloy. Unfortunatelythere is no chemistry between them at all. Meg Ryan comesoff as a very confused and disturbed person who surroundsherself with unappealing people. Into this mix is a grisleymurder, which Malloy investigates. Unfortunately, again,the plot makes no sense what so ever. Truely horrible.I'm sorry I ever saw this terrible film and wasted almosttwo hours watching it. Those two hours, I might add, seemedmuch longer.So, save yourself the pain: stay away."
3,A Different side of Meg Ryan,"After many years as a popular main stream actress, Meg Ryan, in this film, decided to show us what she's got and whats she's got ain't bad. It's almost but not quite worth the price of admission. Ryan, playing the quiet, somewhat apathetic English teacher, Franny, gets romantically involved with Detective Mallory, played by Mark Ruffalo, during a murder investigation.Director Jane Campion does a comendable job of develing the hot and cold, sometimes steamy relationship between Ryan and Ruffalo but at the expense of the overall story line. Apparently she decided to exploit the erotic aspect of the story and concentrate on that rather than properly develop the suspenseful angle to it's full potential.She does try to create more of a thriller feeling toward the end but it hasn't been properly set up and it falls short in that respect."
3,All men are beasts,"A disturbing mood, disjointed photography, and a puzzle hold the interest for a while, but the ending is a disappointment. Not a nice guy in the whole movie, and why does she stay with the one she ends up with. Men have to be chained up to be trusted. You'll see what I mean."
2,"I CAN""T BELIEVE THIS IS R","I saw this film on regular tv in the UK and wanted to buy a copy for a friend back in the States as I thought it made a real statement about women, how they think and feel, how they are seen and perceived and a lot about the women who made the film. In the version I saw it was extremely explicit but very sensual and these scenes helped create the plot and atmosphere. I was SOOOO disappointed with this R rated version - it was cut to ribbons and if you blinked you'd miss an essential plot point - it wasn't even worth giving to my friend as it is a travesty of the film I saw.Perhaps I should have had the Director's Cut - but not being familiar with the differences, I assumed an R was what I had seen - if this is an R I can't help but wonder what the non R is like and how little it could offer in terms of nuance and atmosphere."
2,Pass on this one,"This film reeks of 'trying too hard.' From too many random, disconnected shots (woman in wedding dress in subway, flags, pouring sugar on the table in the diner etc) to heavy-handed plot development (ramming red herrings down our throats) this film just doesn't work...on any level. Characters that are more like caricatures, unbelieveable in their words and deeds..."
2,If you read the book,"you will find this slow and unpleasant movie does not have the psychological tension the book had. The characters are never fully explored and developed; Meg Ryan is wooden rather than detached, Mark Ruffalo, while a bit dark, is much more likeable than dangerous, and the viewer will wonder what's up with Cornelius! I found the sex dull and gratutitous rather than obsessive and my husband, who did not read the book, thought the whole movie confusing and eventually ""silly."" Beware, readers of the book, this ending is different as well."
1,In the Cut,"This crap absolutely reeked! The story made no sense and Meg forgod's sake keep your clothes on, you are years past nude scenes."
5,Who needs a story?,"Okay, this movie gets five stars form me. It might not have been the best movie ever made. The plot might be thin, the performances might be grim....but I've been waiting over 20 years to see Meg Ryan naked (one breast in ""The Doors"" doesn't count) and if I've got to watch a bad movie to see it, I'm going to do it ... !"
3,Palpably pleasurable pain,"3 1/2Even if only packaged with audio-masochist-completists in mind, the flimsy but balanced double-dose of death diversities certainly begs far further examination than many are willing to invest but most definitely not enough to build a cult over."
5,Brilliant black metal drone jazz,This is the first ever naked city I gotAnd its fantasticI love the bonus disc..its almost Drone metalThe first disc stat of with a brutal guitar riff..and the excellent vocals.;of the japanese singerI didnt know what to expect..but if disk 1 is just to crazy for youEnjoy the much slower and great disk 2I love it very very much!
5,Not for the faint of heart,"John Zorn and Naked City are at their best on these two recordings, which challenge listeners with genre-bending playing and compositions. The players' virtuosity is evident but never flaunted or wasted over the course of over sixty tracks.If you are easily offended, you might want to leave this CD in a paper bag; the cover art of Torture Garden includes images of Japanese Sado-Masochism and the Leng Tch'e side has photos of a man being slowly executed by being cut into 100 pieces."
3,Well....,"It had potential. There are some great ideas here; little bits and pieces of the less-than-a-minute songs that really caught my ear. And then... that was it. Many songs are simply unlistenable. The vocals are sometimes amazing, and other times disgusting, and the same with the saxophone. What Zorn was thinking when he threw sax into a grind mix.... is far beyond me. I think he was on some hardcore drugs when he did some of this stuff. (He'd start writing something good, shoot up, then keep writing.)I give the album/s 3 stars because there is some good stuff here that I thoroughly enjoy listening to. This work is by no means genius or mastery, but it can be incredibly entertaining sometimes.I will admit, however, that some of the songs (especially speedfreaks) must've required AMAZING skill to play.Highly recommended for fans of grindcore. Not as much for anyone else.Leng Tch'e makes good background music, not so hot for active listening."
5,"The ""benchmark"" B-36 book!!","Finally! The B-36 book I've waited decades for. I liked the first-person accounts in Jacobsen's ""Convair B-36"" but was a little disappointed with the technical coverage. ""Magnesium Overcast"" tells the story of the aircraft with text and tremendous photo coverage. The photos of the 1952 tornado damage are especially interesting. I knew there had to be photos out there somewhere! This is a book I'll refer to many times. Thanks Mr. Jenkins!!"
2,"Pictures, Drawings, and Charts too small to make ou details","After reading the many five star reviews for this book, I purchased it. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! A large portion of the pictures, drawings, and charts are too small to see in detail - many of the pictures are 2"" x 2"" - being very difficult see. It appears that most, if not all of the reviews are for the hardbound version of the book, not the paperback version - which seems to be a fraudulent practice."
4,Needs more meat,"The photos in the book are worth the price of admission, so it shouldn't be a surprise that the accompanying text is so flat. The book focuses almost entirely on the technical side of the aircraft and completely ignores the political, military, and economic forces that shaped the B-36. There are no crew accounts of 30 hour missions. There are few indications of how the B-36 was used (or more importantly, why it wasn't used). In fact, one gets the impression that upon leaving the factory each plane was just rotated back to the factory for an endless series of upgrades.Still, the detail here is marvelous. Photos and diagrams are provided for nearly every important part. Changes are often detailed down to individual planes. While the book does have a tendency to get bogged down in model numbers and lingo, it still manages to impart a sense of the majesty of this huge and innovative airplane."
2,Very Basic Overview,"This book is a very basic overview of the keys to client service. You could just read the chapter titles and you would get about the same amount of information as reading the chapters themselves. Given, the title does say ""things you already know"", so the author indicates that none of this should be news... but I would have liked to see some more concrete examples of how to put his advice into practice.For example, under the one page ""Chapter 10: Make your clients feel at home"", the recommendation is have the receptionist greet them and offer them water ... concluding with ""Never overlook the importance of making a great first impression."" Sure, okay. But what can the client service person DO to make the client feel comfortable? And in this day and age, not all clients are coming to your office, many interactions are via email or phone... what then?"
3,Year of the Drinking Game,"Okay, line up as many shot glasses as you can find, play the movie, and you drink:-every time Mickey Rourke's character says something racist-every time Mickey Rourke's character mentions spare ribs-every time Ariane has a gratuitous nude sceneEven if all you've got is lite beer, you'll be hammered by the time Capt. Stanley White gets his transfer orders in the third act."
1,Year of the drag,"Let me start off by saying I've seen this movie only twice. The first time I was impressed, but only recently realized I had only seen the last third of the movie. After viewing it on cable recently I cannot believe I ever liked it in the first place. Two problems are: the editing is atrocious, Cimino cuts from one scene to another too abrubtly and the chemistry between Rourke and the tv journalist is non-existant. Also the ending left me shaking my head, and the plot was a bit hard to follow. Finally, Cimino relies too much on gentle guitar music, like he did succesfully in ""The Deer Hunter"" Beleive me there are no tender moments in this film."
3,Not Cimino's best effort>>>,"I still like this movie, but I wish they would have left out some of the storyline [I think the trip to Burma could have been left out].I would rate this higher, but the movie digresses too much. I would have preferred to have more of John Lone [who's exceptional!] and more Mickey Rourke.Still, it was enjoyable."
4,yr of dragon,"I am a mickey rourke fan, at least the early movies. He will always get my attention. I enjoyed this flm espicially ""black Powder Ma"" it came on time and is in good shape"
5,See How Good Looking Mickey Looked Before Plastic Surgery,"Okay, this one didn't make a blockbuster list, but I worked in it and it holds sentimental memories. I just wish that Mickey Rourke had never gotten plastic surgery to look younger. I think he would have age very handsomely.This is cops and gangsters, organized Asian criminals. Trust me, they are scarier than American Gangsters."
4,Great Movie,"Mickey Rourke is absolutely great in this movie. He portrays the NY cop so well you think you are watching a live version of the actual guy. Totally convincing!!!The story is great and the atmosphere is superb. Whatever happened to movies like this? A little dark, real ""on-site"" settings and a great cast.Tremendous film. Let's get it on DVD soon. It is one of the few movies I NEED for my collection."
2,Highly Unappealing,"I feel compelled to write this review in light of the glowing commentary provided by some other customers. I found this movie unpleasant to say the least. Though it had some interesting ideas, there was not a single appealing character in the film. While some might call this ""realism,"" to me this was just poor scripting. I've seen films that made unpleasant people who are still appealing characters (such as the Usual Suspects or Resevoir Dogs) but this movie couldn't even make a ""tough policeman"" type appealing. I cannot deny that the up-in-arms attitude of many Asian American groups towards this film are uncalled for, but at the same time I found it self indulgent, dull, and, as my title says, highly unappealing. Though I'm apparently in the minority in this view (judging by the other customer reviews) I feel obliged to make it known, and to mention that everyone who I watched this with agreed with me. I guess I'm trying to say that this movie isn't for every one. :)"
5,"Movies like this can't be made anymore, 5 stars","This is a really great movie what I love about it is that the drama in it is completely over the top. Its about a renegade cop who disregards his own superiors to take on chinatown and take down an up and coming chinese gangster Joey Tai played by the guy from the Last Emperor. Its a bit of a stereotypical movie but its what movies are supposed to be. Its really dramatic and violent as hell, his wife gets killed, one of his partners get gunned, and meanwhile he starts a romance with a chinese news reporter feeding her tips to run stories about the chines emob and piss them off, they rape her lol, The cop played by Mickey Rourke is an absolute Tornado everyone around him gets hurt. Watch this movie they don't make em anymore like this."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun but not as easy as it sounds!",How hard can it be to get your partner to guess a word using only a one word clue? HA! Harder than you think! That is what makes this game such fun to play. Game has to be played with 4 people. The scoring can be difficult to keep up with and I didn't care for the score pad design but the game is STILL worth it. Brings back memories of childhood watching the show.
3,not for the vocabulary challenged,"This game is fun, can cause laughs but requires alot of thinking. I wouldn't suggest this game for people with small vocabularies."
1,Password-New 5th edition,"This game is so cheap looking, compared to what it used to be like 30 yrs.ago. Just alot of cheap cardboard."
1,What junk!,"Boo-Hiss. What a major letdown! The constant theme when we tried to play this game was that it was too hard and nothing like the television show. Everyone's interest quickly faded. The scoreboard is cheesy, and why isn't there a timer? Simply awful! Do not buy this game you will be sorry that you did. I would also like my money back, and all of it! Including the shipping!"
1,Endless Games Gored A Great Game,"Having all of the Milton Bradley and Pressman editions of Family Feud, Endless Games' latest version is the weakest of this bonafide classic home game. The nostalgic feeling of making bell sound effects while pulling the slides has been silenced with a couple of crayons and a wipe-off board with no feet to prop up the board on the floor or table.To their credit, Endless Games has released several quality games, i.e. Concentration and Password, but their Family Feud edition is a dud. With the success of Louie Anderson's ""Feud"", my hope is for an updated edition with a deluxe plastic game board."
4,Let&#65533;s start the &#65533;Family Feud&#65533;!,"Endless games has this bad habit of either doing a good version of a game... (i.e. ""Password"") or a bad version of a game (i.e. ""Pyramid"" or ""Price is Right""). This one falls somewhere in the middle. While all of the elements are there, the 'on the cheap' production which has everything made of cardboard makes this inferior to the old Milton Bradley versions of the game. Check various auction sites for those, or buy this version if you absolutely must."
3,Needs Improvement,"The board and method of recording the answers is too small for the players to see. I used a large poster board which worked fine. We played it on Thanksgiving and I wasn't sure if the game would be easy enough for children to play but it was; a 9 year old got all of the number 1 answers on fast money. Overall, we really enjoyed it."
4,The great Family Feud,"This game is great, fantastic, superb. It is a time where you do not answer ""yes"" or ""no"". You come up with wondrous, interesting answers. Fun for all ages this game is so great. I give it 4 stars!!"
2,very old answers,"couldnt relate to answers , very oldplus is not user friendly , you have to keep erasing the board and re writing on it.very old fashion"
3,Classic Feud Game,"It's not like the TV Show, but it still good simple game for a medium to large crowd to having Feuding fun."
3,It was somewhat disappointing,"Classic Family Feud 4th Edition--The booklet with the survey questions is all you are paying for. It comes with 3 (small and smaller) pieces of cardboard labeled ""STRIKE INDICATOR"", ""SURVEY SAYS"", and ""TEAM 1 / TEAM 2"", and a dry erase marker. For the price, I expected more--a timer and/or buzzers, perhaps a magnetized game board for the ""strike"" pieces...so it was somewhat disappointing."
1,unhappy,I was very disappointed with my Family Feud game !! I could not believe it didnt come with a timer or a bell! What good is the game without these 2 items?Hopefully this will be addressed and I will be sent the 2 items.The game is useless without them!! Very Disappointed!!!!!!
4,The computerization of society,"Who is interested in the subject comunication will find this book really interesting. The title itself it's self explanatory, it talks about how the globalization of the information will affect the world. The book was written in the early 70's and the authors, Alain Minc and Simon Nora, predict most of the things that are happening today. I do recommend!"
3,Not essential,"I would say this is a good reference but I have to say that I've owned it for 3 years and have probably used it 5 times. I'm more likely to look at the Unit's policy than to rely on this reference. I give it 3 stars because it does have a great deal of information, but that information changes all the time!"
2,Disappointing,"The seller said that this was brand new but it came in less than perfect condition. It was wrinkled, ripped, and the cover was crappy."
2,Very disappointing.,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Goonies. I really love it. But, this soundtrack is very disappointing. I bought it because I love the film so much, but it's really not very good. Of course the Cyndi Lauper track Goonies Are Good Enough is great, and the one track from the score by Dave Grusin is very nice, but there needs to be more of it. Most of the other songs in the film are fairly unmemborable. I wish they had released the whole score."
4,A gem of a book. It glitters like a prism in a window.,"Subtitled ""Inspiring Comfort in Every Room"", this book is both comfortable and exciting to read. Each idea is presented simply. There is no talking down to the reader. I found ideas and concepts that I had never thought of; ideas that I had forgotten; and some old favorites. Sure, home decorating inspirations can be found everywhere from imposing fashionable magazines to weekly tabloids these days. I want a copy of this book because I am sure that I will forget some really great idea contained in it. And this book is STUFFED with great ideas."
4,"Fantastic, But Fragile","I truly LOVE this Kit!! My only issue is that I have serious probs with the putting together of the hands & fingers; they do not stay, nor fit properly on one, but I was able to correct the other. Still, I had to use some glue to keep all the fingers from falling out. That was a surprise! The flexibility is both a plus & burden; some of the parts easily slip off more often than not.The 'wings' are very heavy, of course, but they will not stay locked in place, or have enough tension to have poseable fun with them. Maybe it's just me, and I screwed this thing up somehow. Otherwise, it's a project to put together, so be very patient when working on it!Had no probs with delivery or timely manner or receiving it. Good Merchant. I am so looking forward to buying more Gundam Kits from this Merchant!"
5,Great Quality but slow delivery -.-,"the quality of the model kit is pretty good BUT, the delivery was pretty slow, but i will give this item 5-star anyways ;)"
3,"*** for $1.76 offer; if alot more $$$, look up ""Collectables"" label sets","Possibly the most recycled rock music in history, available all over Amazon: 1964 remakes and covers, by Little Richard. None here match the '50s originals, although Tutti and Molly actually pack more excitement, with the singers' deepened voice blending beautifully with all that good ""Churchy"" echo.The covers are of Penniman pals like Fats Domino and Larry Williams - jazzed up renditions, with a high ""fun"" factor.The sound on the covers is substandard.[review based upon Amazon ""samples""]"
1,"10 songs? What is this, the millenium collection?","A CD can hold almost 80 minutes of music. What's this, about 25 or so. Jesse James used a gun; these turds use deception."
3,Too thin so they bend easily!,"I use the needles for trigger point therapy. These bend too easily. They are painless because they are thin, but I recommend the purple type."
1,Very generic sounding,"Ok i'm not gonna lie here I didn't listen to the whole album but the songs I heard on the Stooges my space page far from impressed me. It sounds like a dull and uninspired generic Iggy Pop solo record..""My idea of fun..Is killing everone"" Just to let everyone know I am a huge Stooges fan and own the original presses of the first three albums and the remastered and remixed versions and a lot of bootleg stuff. I would say listen to it before you buy or else you're just gonna be trading it in. It pains me to write this when I heard the Stooges were making a new album I was ecstatic but now i'm just thinking of what could have been if drugs didn't ruin the first two incarnations of the band. The shows they did at the Wiltern and on Jimmy Kimmel were excellent though. Sad"
5,SCHNEB THOSE WHO ARE NOT FANS...,"Wow, my husband, who is a genius, turned my on to the Stooges recently. I can't believe what I have been missing all my life! They are so fab, I had to go out and purchase all the older great stuff I missed. The new CD combines the brillance of early FUNHOUSE with dashes of that wonderful Detroit madness. WOW! If you liked RAW POWER, but loved some of the more obscure stuff, this new CD will make you toot like a greyhound. Yowser!!!"
1,Ick,This is a bad record. And the saddest aspect of this audio nightmare is that it will forever be a part of an otherwise perfect discography.Unlistenable at any volume.
1,a very bad cd,"a very bad cdwhere the the new music of the stoogesI believe I am back in 1969Nothing newOnly bad stuff from the first till the last numberThe can do better,Why did they noet do it?There is more than 90 years of music with these 3 guysRegards, John Grooteman"
3,OK for stooges,"I'll make this review simple. If you like the stooges punk sound, I believe most of you will like this, except for those who still expect him to be cutting his chest with razorblades in a musical sense. I wasn't a big fan of the 3 chord punks in the day but this album actually has 6 songs that I like enough to bring back out and play from time to time. I don't feel as though I wasted my money, but I don't feel it was my wisest choice either. If your a stooges fan, give it a try. If your not a stooges fan best to buy something else."
3,Not exactly the promise shown on Skull Ring or Telluric Chaos,"Lots of the British press were going nuts about the official reunion of Messrs. Osterberg and Asheton after getting back together for a few of the tracks that made up Skull Ring. Somewhere between the Who (dreadful) and the Police (probably the least of three evils) in terms of how reunions sound fell this album.There aren't any instant classics on here like ""Down on the Street"" or ""TV Eye"" or ""Search and Destroy."" It doesn't really go into the old neighborhood until ""Free and Freaky.""It sounds like, well, three middle aged guys and a Minuteman playing on a new Iggy album and if you are a fan of Iggy in any stage of his close to forty years of recording, you'll find that enough of a reason to buy this. I did.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
2,Gimme Boredom!,"First I gotta say that I love Iggy and have enjoyed most all his solo work-post Stooges. The best and most brutal recent solo effort Beat EmUp kills both this and the Somewhat less offensive Skull Ring. I dont believe It has anything to do w/ Iggys age so lets just dispense w/ thatgibberish! The music on this disc has no hooks whatsoever. Maybe repeated listening will make me enjoy it more but right now I am not sure its gonna get that chance. I tuned into an A&E; special on skinheads and it reminded me of the music represented here (without the lyrically racist angle).Sadly, without that message you get nothing as is the case here.It sounds mostly like a contractual obligation that they were forced into doing and Iggy is giving them what they deserve S**t! To even mention the brilliant NY Dolls comeback disc in conjunction w/ this should be a crime !"
2,Is this the best they could do?,"Jesus, I love the Stooges and I love Iggy. I even listen to some of Iggy's weaker stuff because he does try new things but this album is a real cop-out. Nothing new, just a tired rehash of a sound that's a pale imitation of their first two albums. None of the songs truly rock and Iggy's voice is just plain bad on this. Where's the Down on the Street? Raw Power? Not one of those caliber songs on this album. You can see it on the reviews on this board--everyone's making excuses. I wanted to like it too but they simply didn't deliver. I'm going to see them next month and hope they don't focus on this poor material."
3,I don't know. I REALLY want to love this album but...,"...somehow it just doesn't grab me no matter who many times I listen to it. It's got all the right components - Iggy at the Mic, slick, wah-wah guitar, one of the best bass players in the business, and certainly good drumming, but somehow this disc never becomes more than the sum of the ingredients. This is not Iggy's best singing. The lyrics seem forced at times and are not particularly memorable. The songs have the primal overdriven texture of Stooges songs without really having the feel of the Stooges songs. It's worth getting to complete your Iggy collection, though, if you're a long time fan."
3,so-so comeback,well well well. the stooges are back. iggy is in good from but overall this could have been better. the asheton brothers make a great racket but it is mreo noisy than energezic. we would have expected more from these guys. maybe (probably) it is the dismal production of albini that really kills it all. also the song titles are not that great (i.e. awful).
4,"Not bad, not brilliant","Looking for the 60's Stooges? Gone. I'm glad Mike Watt is here. It's a valient effort and some songs hit their stride but it's not the gem one might hope for. In the end, it's about the song writing for most bands and they just didn't come up with memorable songs. I like a lotta the Stooges material from back in the day and even more the No Values and Soldier solo lps from Iggy. I'll stick with that but I'm glad I bought this disc. Worth hearing but will repeatedly listen to those solo albums way more over the years. Have already."
4,IT'S WORTH IT!,"If you are a Stooges and Iggy fan, you will like this album. It is raw and it will remind you of all the good stuff they have done so far. In fact, I did not like the album a lot at first since I only listened to the 30-sec samples here on Amazon. However, if you take your time and listen to the whole album, you might change your mind, as I have. I understand some reviews have been pretty negative, but I disagree and can't have enough of this record now, which by the way is 3-sided. I wonder why they did not spread the songs throughout the four sides of the double set. Why waste that precious space? Were they in a hurry to release it?"
3,"Disappointing, but hardly surprising","You were expecting a great Stooges record? Never gonna happen, but not a terrible Iggy record. Ron's got some great riffs and Steve blows his brains out.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City instead!"
4,"More in the red, please","Great record, but does anyone else notice that the vocal track is a little low in the mix?"
1,i cant believe the stooges did this crap wish it never came out,they should of never got back together to do a studio album this sounds nothinglike the old stooges its complete crap but iggy is the man i would of thoughhe would never be dumb enough to put this out i guess just old age getting to himi still love iggy and the stooges are one of my favorite bands but i just cant believe they put this out i wish it never came out
2,This is not raw power or fun house,"Well I have to say after listening to this album I'm so glad i didn't plop down my money for it. The Stooges are great but this album is not. Stick to the old stuff and maybe their next one (if there is one) will grasp the true essence of what the Stooges and Iggy are all about. If you are a die hard fan and want to listen to anything they put out then you won't be let down. But for the rest of you put in Fun House and drift away to Loose, 1970 or any of the other awesome tracks on the LP."
4,"The Stooges old school proto-punk, nothing less nothing more!","The Stooges fourth album ""The Weirdness"" is just an old school throwback album. A lot of raw music with some gritty vocals. Don't expect some kind of musical masterpiece. Just sit back and relax and listen to some three chord rock n' roll as only The Stooges can provide. A couple of songs are pretty weak (like ATM) but the rest makes up for it. Recommended if you like plain old rock n' roll by one of the genre's innovators."
2,Don't be swayed by the true believers,"I could go on endlessly about why this effort has no merit, but I'll let other reviewers here do it for me. On the other side, their are a fair number of reviewers who claim ""credibility"" by saying that they come from Detroit and wax ad nauseum as to why this is such a great return of the fabled Stooges...""you had to be there"" and that sort of nonsense. Let me just say that I'm 56 years old, grew up in Detroit and Warren, saw their first concert at the Grande and witnessed them (and the solo Ig) innumerable times over the years. They we're indeed a mesmerizing force at the time and, the truth be told, changed the musical landscape. Unfortunately, you would never know it by listening to this uninspired drivel. I give it two stars out of misplaced respect and the fact that two songs on the CD are OK (""My idea of fun"" and ""The weirdness"")."
5,A must for Classic French Movies lovers...,"If you like Fernandel, these are two classic French movies you will not be disappointed with , provided you understand French without subtitles. Mario, first a sheep shearer then a dog groomer, becomes little by little a famous lady hairdresser on the Camps Elysees. A lot of laughter and emotion, Fernandel in one of his best leading role. The Mouton a Cinq Pattes; Monsieur de Saint Forget an elderly man had quintuplet 40 years earlier whom he had not seen for 25 years. The local town mayor wants to reunite this large family which happens with all kinds of funny episodes."
5,Where Are My Socks?,The City Drive rocks your socks off. This album is unbelievable. Truely something everyone will love. Hi yo!
1,"Total rip-off, this is a leaflet..","Do not waste your money...this is a pocket pamphlet...empty of anything worthwhile...SOOOO SMALL...should be priced @ $2.00...no more..very old info and vague descriptions..my copy was dog-eared, faded, and sun burned"
2,Not What You Think Your Getting,"I have been trying to order a copy of Portraits of Conflict: A Photographic History of Arkansas in the Civil War. The book was printed in about 1989 as part of a state series by Univ. of Ark. Press. On two seperate occassions, I have tried ordering the book online at Amazon. Both times, although listed as the correct item, the order has been filled with the Mississippi edition. This item is a review of the book, and not a ""read only"" purchase of the book. This item is absolutely useless. You can't return it. You can't cancel it."
4,It has Western Movies on it,I've been looking for the The Olympics version of 'My Baby Loves Western Movies' since I lost the 45 at a party almost 50 years ago.The CD is OK.But Western Movies is my pride and joy.Now if I can only get Dave Van Ronk's rendition of 'If Yous a Viper'.....without having to pay $130 for the CD...
5,Worth the price!,"Can't go wrong! Like the previous rating I read, the clipper was quiet, didn't pull hair and did a great job. For the price, how can you lose?"
4,"Great, but...","Everything is great although the cutter is somewhat bulky and heavy.I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but this razor *sometimes* cuts hair with pulling. I guess it is just my hair since the hair is semi-curly. I had experienced this pulling a few times during my haircut, but this was not a severe problem since the pain associated with these events was relatively minor."
1,It's cheap,"When i cut my 6 year old son's hair, my son screamed with hair being pulled. The motor is also loud, my son couldn't stand it. I returned it anyway."
2,Should have spent a couple bucks more,"I use these clippers to cut my hair. I use them with no guard so my hair is probably around 1/8 of an long. I have to go over every part of my head at least 3 times to get a decent cut. They bog down to the point of completely stopping all the time. If you are looking for some clippers just to touch up sideburns and that sort of stuff then this is fine, but if you are really going to cut your hair with it then spend the money and buy something a little more commercial."
3,Beautiful Cards,"The graphics on the cards are beautiful, but for a beginner like me, the book was not so helpful on the meaning behind the cards and layouts. Recomend for a already know-how tartot reader."
4,Cards Were Stuck Together,"The cards are beautiful, always been a big fan of the Rider-Waite deck. My only complaint is that when I got them I had to spend several minutes carefully separating each card as they were all stuck together. Once I got them separated it took a few times shuffling the cards to get them to easily shuffle together. All in all though, very good deck. I don't use the tarot books but for some one that has never used the cards before I would suggest looking through the book to get an idea of what each card is especially for the Major Arcana and to familiarize oneself with the suites."
4,All You ever wanted to know......about Tarot,"I have always used this Type of cards , I bought them for my G daughter just to learn and leave mine alone, wish the book was bigger like the one I've for many years,,I recommend them as a start kit."
5,Universal Waite Tarot Book & Deck Review,"This is the first Tarot deck I ever purchased. As one of the Golden Dawn designs, a very popular one written about and used to illustrate many Tarot books, it is quite a good purchase.It is one of the modern Tarot decks which includes illustrated minor arcana cards in addition to complex art of the major arcana, and when I read about Tarot divination and esoterica and Tarot symbolic images, I open the deck and review what is said in the book. I am quite certain this will help me to learn the secrets of the Tarot."
1,Not REALLY the Waite Tarot,"This is not really the Waite Tarot. It is only based on the Waite Tarot.Also, the cards have a slick feeling that I do not like.If you know that these cards are not truly the Waite Tarot, maybe you will like them. I went by their name only, and so was disappointed. This should teach me to read the fine print."
4,Better than the original,"As other reviewers have said, the coloring on these cards is excellent. I found the original Rider-Waite deck to be garish and distracting; this is much better. The finish is very slick.The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, written by Arthur Waite, is included in this set (or can be purchased separately). It was written around 1910, and the first 70 pages are almost impenetrable unless you know something about the Order of the Golden Dawn and Waite's background. Skip that part and just read his description of the cards. You will find that many other authors have simply re-summarized Waite's original descriptions.This book (and some version of the Rider-Waite deck) belong in every tarot library. But this book is perhaps not the easiest place to start."
3,Beautiful Colors,"The Universal Waite Tarot Deck is beautifully printed. The colors are much more vivid than on the Rider Waite, and the backs are nicer (Black with gold star bursts, instead of blue plaid). My main gripe is the US Game systems Copyright printed on the front of the cards. It totally destroys the feel and magic of the cards. I have many other decks that do not have the obnoxious copyright statement printed on them."
2,terrible,"so the product itself would of been wonderful, if it was packaged correctly. it was in original packaging so would look amazing but the seller just badly wrapped the box for the cards and book tightly and ended up bending it in half almost and ruining the nice box that everything fits into so its no longer usuable and the book is all bent up. need to learn how to package correctly this is unfair. the stuff might of been new when they had it but after they packed it it was so damaged it just looks terrible. I also didnt realize the cards were colored in like little biblical drawings not that the pictures are biblical but they way they are colored with like colored pencils the pictures online did not look colored that badly so they had to be edited to look better or something."
4,Provocative stuff,Pretty hot stuff if you like that kind of thing. Kind of a psuedo rape theme throughout the book.
1,static,"This album sounds like Bastard Noise just recorded radio static for hours on end. The tracks are monotonous; only a few tracks have vocals, which are made up of unintelligible screaming. Save your money and don't buy this garbage."
1,incomplete and a waste of time,"this book is one of the most uninteresting books connected to skateboard culture i have ever seen, it could have had SOOOOOOOOO much more in it, and the variety of stickers is just pathetic, you could find cooler collections on Ebay for christ sakes!"
1,ATTENTION - Before you order this,This product is not what it appears - It is not very clear that it does not actually include any stickers at all. It is simply a book looking at pictures of stickers. DO not buy if you are expecting stickers
3,good,"disappointing i thought it included stickers , stll a cool little book though ... ... ... ... ... ... .."
5,Helpful!,We are planning a trip to see Laura Ingalls' home in Missouri with my daughters after reading the books and this is very helpful.
3,"Good source for touring sites, rehash of some old material.","If I were to take any books along with me on a LIW journey, it would be this one. The reason for a lower rating is because I was disappointed in a rehash of what to find at the Little House sites that was already published in another of Anderson's titles."
3,Cheap way to tune your bicycle gearing,Gearing is personal and you might need a few of these rings to dial in your preferences. Then when you have found your comfort zone you can buy a nice 1/8 inch crankset for your fixie/bicycle.
3,"only 3 good tracks, but they're really good tracks so your call...","Only 3 good tracks on this CD: Truth and Rights (Thievery Corporation so of course it's good...); Samba Love (Kaskade - my favorite track); and 7 Days Without Kanan (Garth Trinidad). These 3 tracks are great!However... all the other tracks are throwaway/forgettable/or not good at all. Some big names came to the plate on this CD and struck out: Marques Wyatt; Louie Vega; Miguel Migs; Mark Farina. This CD should have been solid full of hits, but these guys dropped sub-par tracks. Sorry, but that's how it is."
5,"Basic cable...Fits the bill, without emptying your wallet!","This 50 foot cable did just the job I needed it to. I had to run it across a relatively large room through the ceiling to connect to a TV on the other end. It works great, and I have a nice clear picture. For this price, what do you have to lose?"
4,NOTE: This CD comes with a 2nd disc - DVD concert footage,I saw these guys perform LIVE and there is no other like them. Elvis impersonator as a lead singer and covering Led Zeppelin tunes? How can 5 million fans be wrong?
5,Great quality,"Had bought this same set at a local Oneida outlet store but only bought one set. Love the quality and look and feel of this flatware. They've been run through the dishwasher countless number of times and it still looks like new. Couldn't find it locally anymore so I turned to the Internet. The name was different but thanks to reviews and such, took a chance that they were right in that this is the same set as the original one I bought and it was."
3,"Good, but not worth $30","Like the other review said, the tape always comes apart. I would not have wasted 30 dollars just like that, so I bound up the thing with tape. The gadget ideas are creative (and good to little brother-proof your room too!) and it includes spy kit cards that have little did u know things. it also has a 6(or seven or eight, i forgot) page spy ""training manual"" that has tips on how to use your gadgets and other stuff. Overall, I think this toy is great, but should just something like ~$20. You decide whether you'll buy it or not."
1,HORRIBLE,"If They say, a sturdy spy kit i guess they mean the box becaues everything falls apart in the kit. It is cool for a little while but then it doesn't work. Worth 5 bucks. With that money save it up for some real spy gear for a micro cammera or something. DO NOT GET"
1,Ultimate Junk Kit,"My son was jonesing for this kit, so I got it for him, but never heard about it again (he took it to his mom's house). When I asked a month later, he said it wasn't any good, that nothing worked, and that it broke. I'm only here because I was thinking about getting the Ultimate Car Kit for him for his birthday, but now he says he doesn't want it!"
1,spy kit,I am going to try to return it. The kit is worth about $3.00It falls apart and your kid cries.
1,Not authentic,"coconut soup, tomatoes and potatoes? in a book which allegedly features the recipes of a german mystic who dies before 1200 A.D.?The recipes sound nice enough!but this is NOT hildegardis stuff.So, since that is waht I was looking for it was an epic fail even before I found teh chocolate cookies.So this one WILL be returned, because, it is simply false advertisement"
5,The best Manfred in years,"This new, live, recording is sensational. The sound packs a wallop, the playing is nearly faultless, the conducting strong. Best of all, there's no hanky-panky with the score: no cuts, and no orchestration changes like so many conductors do. Of the Manfred's that have come our way recently, this one is the best as far as I'm concerned. The most amazing thing is that this orchestra can play this fiendishly difficult score so well in a live performance. Ok, so the playing time is short, for a Manfred of this power I'll overlook that."
5,treble clef flatware review,"Love it, love it, love it! Coolest looking flatware i've ever seen. Feels good while holding the pieces too. Only problem is, it makes me want to eat more often!"
5,Just what I was looking for,"This silverware is great. I absolutely love it. It reminds me of being in Tuscany with a bowl of pasta & a glass of wine. The best part is that it does very well in the dishwasher, a must for me. I am very pleased."
1,Look nothing like the picture,"Just a warning, these look nothing like in the picture.Not sleek and shiny, very dull.very clumsy looking and oversized in my opinion...a friend of mine thought they were barbeque forks. too bad because i was really excited about these too. all the raving reviews and beautiful pictures...sigh"
2,Huge,"Just a heads up, this flatware is quite oversized. The soup spoon is too wide to comfortably eat with. I love the style, but unfortunately the dimensions are overkill."
4,"Solid, well crafted... maybe not for everyone","I love this set, but there are two drawbacks that may be flatware ""dealbreakers"" for some. First, the perportions are unusually large-- I almost never find myself using the large spoon or fork. Second, the finish of the handles is matte, and feels a bit like a chalkboard, which I've been told can be unsettling and uncomfortable to use. The weight of the pieces is excellent and well-crafted."
2,Black finish doesn't look stable,"Lovin' this pattern, and I have a similar set formerly known as ""Lily"". This version of Treble Clef is not of such a high quality. The black finish appears to be eroding off already (had them about a month) I would still buy them though. I will probably end up liking the rough, ""distressed"" look. But if you desire a ""perfect"" look, then steer clear of these. 2 out of 5 stars."
5,Perfectly Beautiful,"I have had this set for a year now and was a little concerned at first with some of the reviews I read before my purchase. I'm happy I chose this pattern ... it is beautiful to the eye ... has no problem with going thru the dishwasher (as a senior citizen, I love my dishwasher) and I have had no problems with the finish. I don't change dinnerware or flatware often ... same set of Pfaltzgraf dishes for 20 years ... just added pieces. As for my flatware - I simply did not have enough pieces when we had our large family all together so I looked for sets on Amazon. I also purchased the matching cocktail pieces for my set on Amazon's wonderful 4 for 3 sale and use them often. Each of our children has dropped hints that they love my set ... whenever they visit I get compliments! So nice to be Stylish!! I enjoy looking at the table each time it is in use and look forward to many happy years together based on the quality."
3,SEEING IS BELIEVING,"The picture doesn't show the actual size of them..I like the knives, tablespoons, and the forks but the teaspoons are too big..they are larger than a usual teaspoon...the handles are sleak and very comfortable in my hands and they fit nicely inside the cutlery tray. Even though the teaspoons are larger than regular spoons I still love my set. If I had known how big they look I may have still bought the set. I love the knives cause they spread the margarine with 2 swipes across your toast whereas regular knives takes me at least 3 or 4 swipes..."
3,Works... If you stay at it.,"Seems to work (or run them off,) as I would bait each active hole EVERYDAY for about 5 days and finally started noticing that some of the active holes were no longer active. I think the key is to check each day and re-bait until you see no more activity. I use sand to fill the holes so that it makes it easy to determine if the hole is still active or not.Don't expect to use it once and your problems are gone.No biggie, but it comes in a plastic bag and not a bottle as shown."
2,Clear as mud...,"Many of the songs on this release sound like alternates to the versions that became popular.Sound quality on most,if not all, songs is terrible,very muddy and muffled.Save your money."
5,This imaginative book has the creativity to keep kids alive.,"I'm a kid and watch the Magic School Bus on TV. The books are even better! When Arnold gets lost in a hurricane on one of Ms.Frizzle's wacky field trips, the kids need to know the parts of a hurricane to find him. I thought it was creative and funny to include a radio that knew everything and could dance. By the time Ms.Frizzle's class goes on the real field trip, they have become experts on hurricanes. The weather team is amazed at the intelligence of the students. This book is great because it's not like those other books that lag on and on about one subject without any excitment. The Magic School Bus books make subjects like hurricanes, fun to learn about . I liked how the kids knew more than the weather team. I give this book two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!"
3,"OK, but not brilliant","The string sections are very nice and worth the whole thing, if the whole album were only consisting of such nice written work I would give it 5 stars. However the samplings and tapes on this album seems to be misplaced, tossed in over a coffee break and placed there to fill out some gap. Especially so the ethnic ones, and they are most often insignificant to the whole structure. Some sound effects and percussion are of interest but doesn't reach the heights that Zorn can produce. It's still an OK release but not the best of Zorn, yet not the worst either."
1,"Good for its time, now hideously out of date","The information contained in The Paper Trip, and it's sequel, Paper Trip 2 might've been valid in the 1970s and 80s, but now is very much out of date. It does give interesting background information on methods of ""paper tripping"" that did work at one time but don't now. When the US Govt. got wind of Paper Trip, they plugged many loopholes. That's when Barry Reid wrote Paper Trip 2, to get around the new government safeguards. Now, in the 1990s and going into 2000, these methods may or may not work in the hinterlands of America, but forget about any major city. There are other resources out there- seek them out. Use Paper Trip as a historical reference, but nothing more."
3,An engaging main character in a familiar story.,"While much of the drama was obvious, typical of many other books dealing with the Jewish experience in America, the inner life of the main character most certainly was not. I enjoyed being inside Harry Catzkers head. His honesty and imagination make him highly sympathetic and his conversations with Aba in the cherry tree are utterly profound. This book reminded me very much of the writing of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Chaim Potok. I felt so comfortable in this world that i was sorry when it had to end."
3,"The Best Small Parts Drawers, Though Not So Good","I've used Akro-Mils ""Steel Storage Cabinets"" (frames are steel, drawers are plastic) for decades because the tough plastic drawers were deep and came in multiple sizes, and the cabinets were pretty solidly made. In the current version, drawers come in a few colors and have a transparent panel. Unfortunately, compared to my old Akro-Mils cabinets, the new ones are more cheaply made in every respect. The result, I suppose, of an absence of competition."
3,???,"i'm not sure if these songs are sung by an elderly woman or by a child (there is a small boy pictured playing the organ in some of the album's small photos, wearing a white and black furry dog costume; but i seem to recall reading somewhere that this album was made by a woman). these curious little songs are odd, to say the least, in their non sensical and whimsy execution, but charming in their unpretentious approach. comparisons to The Shaggs would be right on...but with a less tuneful ermm..articulation(?). hmmm...not sure if that's what i'm trying to say. this album confounds me."
5,Alert! Videohound's Review is WRONG!!!,"This is not the Smoke soundtrack, like the Videohounds review leads you to believe. It's in japanese and has nothing to do with the movie Smoke. It's songs about a dog! In Japanese!"
4,Great divorce or break-up gift,I gave this to a girlfriend who just went through a tough divorce and she laughed so hard when she saw this! It was a hit at the party! LOL
4,A little humour in the kitchen.......,"I have bought this item twice, both as gifts for others. The knives are a better quality than expected, and the design speaks for itself.I was pleased with the overall quality of this item.Both recipients loved their gift.I suspect they can also use it to vent after a frustrating day.A great multi-purpose gift !"
2,"production is good, but the vocals ruin the album.","The two stars is for the production only. The vocals and lyrics are horrible and get no stars. Decent production, wack vocals. Never should have had vocals on these tracks."
1,Gray out,"Worked fine for the first two years. Then all the pages started coming out with a light gray background. There doesn't seem to be any solution to this on the internet, and Panasonic customer support leaves a lot to be desired.I paid a lot of money for what I thought was going to be a high quality, reliable printer. But just ended up with another piece of junk. I wonder if there is any good one out there?"
3,"Decent, but not what I expected","The game has decent questions and a nice box. I assumed that, like other games packaged in similar boxes, it would come with a box of cards with questions. I was wrong, it came with what looks like 8.5x11 paper stapled in the middle to make a booklet with questions. Does it make the questions any worse? No, but I was disappointed. We used it for a game-show style activity for a group and I had to go through 20-40 questions before I found 5 that were appropriate for the group."
2,Watch the show,"I think watching the show is more fun than this game. Not enough questions to make it a game you can play often. And, no Bob Eubanks!"
3,More players the better,The game is fun and exciting. Some of the questions can cause arguments or get you in trouble with your spouse or significant other. The more the couples the better. Enjoy.
3,Worth it!!,"I love how much fun this game is! It was way too complicated after people started getting drunk, too much writing and thinking lol.. But for a quiet game with no drunk guests this is fun. May be a little to personal for some, be advised this games asks about sex a lot!"
2,Not As Fun As the Gameshow,"While this board game did provide a bit of fun for our group of couples, we found the questions for the most part quite boring. They were divided up for men and women along stereotypical and old-fashioned gender lines. They were clearly also geared ONLY for heterosexual couples. Obviously, this game has not been updated for the '90's, nor was it as much fun as the original gameshow. We ended up making up our OWN questions which were much more entertaining!"
2,"Mildly amusing, but out-of-date","While we did have fun playing this game with a few other couples, the questions were sooooo old-fashioned. For example, ""Who was the last BOY your wife dated before you were married?"" The questions really need to be updated to be relevant, but it was a good distraction for an evening. Not really worth the price tag, though."
4,Lots of fun...,You have to have this game if u don't know your significant other this will help you to get to know them!!!!
3,yeah,yeah t's ok but it leaves something to be desired if you are looking for floss records then it has some good tracksabout it.
3,delightful,"This little book is totally delightful reflecting on real life issues that we all encounter everyday. Bits of wisdom and many a'ha moments so real in a salon. I really like the layout, its is so readable at a glance. You can grab a story on the go and leave with a smile feeling that you and your best friend just shared a secret!"
3,a good book for new kyle fans,i just finished this book and i found that it is a good book to get some back ground on the early years of kyle's green lantern adventures.it's funny how far kyle has come along.i missed the early years(having read the title the last two yaers or so).i found that the book had a good start to it but then it slowed down in the middle.the ending how ever was great!kyle finds out what it takes to be a hero while in a great battle with grayven. this book is deffently worth checking out!
3,An Interesting Read,"I bought this book expecting an introductory wiccan book from the African-American perspective. To some degree, that is what I got. It was a truly informative book about what broght the author to wicca. I enjoyed reading it. It's just that I thought it would be a little more of the nuts and bolts with regard to practicing wicca as a black person.A previous entry stated that the book was full of typos. I didn't see any and the thought process with in the book was not at all disjointed."
2,"I, too, wanted to love this book","Unfortunately, I found it a rather bland read. It is definitely good to have a book out for black people and other minorities who feel they are completely alone on their chosen paths. Also, the grammar, and lack of a proofreader, makes one feel as though the book was rushed to be put out. I do not want to put the author down, that is not my intention. I certainly think there will be better constructed books coming out in the future, and while I applaud the understanding that there needs to be a book out there for minorities, I cannot applaud the horrid use of the English language."
4,Non-stop action!,This is a terrific little thriller. Very realistic action and hard to put down. I recommend it.
3,Back Cover,"Selina was determined to protect her uncle from Adam Tudor. It was clear from the start that Adam was determined, devious and very dangerous. And that he'd even use his powerful sensuality as a weapon-one Selina could not hope to fight.His sensual onslaught heightened her sense of fury at his truly Machiavellian scheme of blackmail and revenge. Adam had made her his pawn-in a battle from which there could be no surrender. An no defeat."
3,Poor Recording Quality/Excellent Singing,"This is a case where the performers do an excellent job in singing, however the recording is live, it has not been Digitally Remastered and the overall sound does not give you the true quality of the voices nor the orchestration. I would suggest this recording to those who are looking to solely here these artists in the recording and nothing more. If you're looking for an excellent recording I would suggest the one by Deutsche Gramaphone with Hampson, Te Kanawa, Murray, Furlanetto, and Levine conducting."
5,Wonderful!,"Our old one broke and we were looking for a new one. The old one was a ""screw-pull"" this is Le Creuset. Not sure if the latter company bought them but it works like a dream. Many thanks."
4,The Price is Right for this game!,This game is very hard to set up all the pieces. When you put the dials together it rips the cardboard. The Prices all not acurate for the items. The showcase could be improved. The game is fun to play for all ages. The game is for 3+ players. But you can still play it more than 5 times and still have fun.
4,Cool Game,"I think that ""The Price is Right"" is a cool game show and a cool game. What boggles me about it is that they have never made a video game or Cd-Rom version of it. They came close when they made the hand-held version of the game (which I have), but still no cigar. I wish they did make a Cd-ROM version of this game and others like ""The 25,000 Pyramid"" and ""Password"", and especially ""Press your Luck"". They would be really, REALLY hot sellers!"
3,Not in Love,"Maybe my hopes were too high, maybe I've just been drinking the other types of chai for too long.... but I am not really liking the Big Train. It's kind of thick and chunky, albeit very spicy. Much better with a splash of milk or milk substitute. But then that sort of defeats the purpose of an instant mix."
3,Meh.,"I bought this mic in a three pack awhile back. I recently got into home recording, and I figured I would use one of them for recording vocals/micing a guitar cab. OW! My ears hurt... the highs and mids overpower like you wouldn't believe. The mic is also really muddy! While of course this can be partly fixed with EQ, it's really annoying spending a long time fixing it in post. It doesn't give out much of a signal even when boosted pretty nicely with a preamp. I do have to say the mics are REALLY durable, solid, and heavy; in fact more than a 58. All in all, it's an okay mic and if this is what you can afford to do recordings, get them only because there cheap. This is absolutely no 58 and not even a PG48... But if you want to spend just a tiny bit more, I say get another mic."
4,OK for amateur. Cable not included.,"The mikes work fine, though not very sensitive.Cables are not included.Separate purchase cost $9 more each."
2,Size Totally Wrong,The quality is great but I gave them a low rating because of the deceiving fit.I've purchased Mootsie Tootsie shoes many times and have worn a size 8-1/2 for 35 years. I ordered these online out of convenience since it's hard to find a place closeby that sells them.When I tried them on they feel more like a 7-1/2. They're not just the type of fit you know will stretch out in just a few wears - I can't even wear them they're so snug!Now to play the game of returning them to the nearest store as recommended by the seller.
3,Not true to size,"I ordered these shoes on-line because I had a pair or Mootsies Tootsies loafers (not Mallory) in size 9M that I absolutely loved. They were so comfortable, leather, and lasted forever, but after many years they were showing their wear and I need to replace them. The Mallory loafers were leather and also very comfortable. Unfortunately, the 9M was too big for me. Leather relaxes with time, especially on this style of shoe, so this 9M was definitely bigger than my original size 9M Mootsies Tootsies loafers. I had to return them.After this experience, I will never buy a pair of shoes on-line unless the shipping is covered both ways. Trying on this pair of loafers has cost me $16.05 in shipping costs!"
4,Sinister Cinema Edition - Well worth the price.,"In contrast to Alpha's edition, Sinister Cinema's release has a much more atmospheric and authentic musical score.There is brief distortion on the print near the start of the film but this lasts a mere few seconds.Otherwise, the picture quality is fine with no washed out or over-dark scenes."
3,Cool look,"This is a cool looking sword. Not even close to sharp though. There is like no blade. You would have to sharpen it if you even wanted it to have a sharp blade. The other thing, make the handle full metal! No wood should be on this sword at all."
5,First paragraph my son wrote was breathtaking!,"My son does not like writing. At all. We've struggled all year long with it, and I've had no idea how to even grade it, and what his 7th grade expectations were. This program makes it all crystal clear. From the brainstorming exercises, to the actual end product, I am very pleased. We've only been through one lesson, and I am hooked. I will use it on my daughter when she is in 7th grade as well.I like that every day is mapped out for you, doing just one or two small things at a time, my son doesn't get overwhelmed. His expectations are right at his level, and he turned out a very well written paragraph for his first assignment!"
3,Description,"Kimberly Freeman was worried to death when her fiance, who had gone out to Sierra Leone in West Africa, seemed to have disappeared with-out trace, and she decided the best thing to do was to follow him out there and see if she could discover what had happened to him.In Sierra Leone, however, she met another man, of a very different kind -- the domineering Dave Nelson, who had a low opinion of Kim, her fiance, and indeed the whole situation between the two of them. And he added. 'Don't run away with the notion that being female gives you any special immunity where I'm concerned.'Kim would rather have ignored Dave altogether -- but now could she?"
2,Gee! Haven't received it yet.,Ordered on August 26th. It is now September 04 at 7:00Pm. Really? Is this coming from another country? My credit card does not reflect this time lapse. You need to try harder! P.S. There is no tracking available when you click on the track package button. Not on Amazon or the company.
4,Oneida Colonial Boston,"My original of this is about 12 years old and I'm delighted to add more place settings of the same design. My only reservation is that there are very slight differences from my earlier pieces (e.g. thickness of the knife handle, Oneida logo placement)."
5,Love our flatware set!,"The Oneida Colonial Boston 24-Piece flatware set more than met our expectations. In fact, we bought several sets we liked it so well.The flatware is high-quality, the right weight and size, and makes our table look out of the ordinary.The look is somewhat plain but I don't like anything ornate. It looks excellent with everyday tableware and also with my more expensive tableware.If you like the look of this flatware, then you won't disappointed in the quality of the product."
1,Beware of the description,"This is not a DVI-Digital(Single-Link)connector, it is a DVI-I connector. the description for this is wrong. also, after further research, it turns out there is no such thing as a dvi-d to vga cable, you can not convert analog to digital without a expensive box."
5,Recently got a pair for 350 Free Shipping,Bowflex website had these suckers on sale for 350 and I had to pick them up. I can resell them for that on Craigslist.. These things are amazing! I've only had them about a month now so I can't say for sure how they hold up in the long haul. At first I was nervous because they weren't working. The dial would click over and the weights would stick. After wiggling they finally came up. This stopped after the first use. Just an FYI keep playing with them a bit.
4,Bowflex SelectTech 1090 Single Dumbbell,"Great piece to have in the gym. Easy to use sometimes gets stuck, alittle bulky but great to have.There's not so much laying around the gym,A lot more room to work out."
4,great space saver,"Although a little bulky to lift with, these weights are a great space saver. 90 lbs is all the weight you need unless you're on steroids. The handle is a little more uncomfortable than the selecttech 552's with more ridges. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. On the pricey side, but pays for its self in a couple of years without paying for a gym membership."
5,Outstanding product,"This is a truly excellent product. I've used a pair of these for months and they have performed admirably. The dial works simply and accurately. They are very well made and tough. Obviously do not drop these on the floor, but they are the best engineered adjustable dumbbells I've ever seen.I highly recommend purchasing the stand - I can't imagine trying to use a pair of these without the stand.For me personally, the diameter of the hand grip is a bit small, but I have large hands. Also, there is deep knurling on the grip which can be uncomfortable until you build up a bit of tolerance. Most ""man hands"" won't have too much trouble, but it can cause some soreness with extended use.All-in-all, tremendous utility and value for the home gym."
1,100 lb dumbel,"I thought I ordered two dumbells each 50 lbs. The package came as one dumbell weighing almost 100 lbs. I was unable to lift the dumbell out of the package. The cd was how to lift two dumbells. How does on exercise with only on dumbell? I will keep it but will not order anything else from amazon com.I could not remove the strap holding the dumbell down, so I had to cut the strap even though I rermoved the screw on the buckle."
1,carefull,I'm returning this product.. When i ordered through my phone i thought i was getting two dumbells giving the fact that all of the pictures on the site have two dumbells illustrated.. Little to be knowned that it is for only one.. Sport's Authority has the 55.5 for the same price.. What a hassle.
5,As good as you can get for 90lbs,Very solid and well engineered product... Here are a few points:* The handles have a bit of a rough grip. When you are using the dumbbells at their max weight it can tear your palms up a little.* I don't recommend getting the stand for the 1090's. The heavy weight makes it awkward to maneuver at that height.* I purchased the Weider Club bench (about $100) to go with it and it works great!* I've searched all over and this is the absolute best price I've found.
2,Love the weights and the stand. Hate the straps,"Length:: 1:30 MinsI have the original adjustable Bowflex 552's with stand purchased @ 2009 and recently bought the 2012 model with stand. The weights have been re engineered, but the stand is exactly the same including the straps. On the originals, the strap lay perfectly flush with the base while sitting on the stand. The stand on the new model is a bit more squared and raised. They did not however redesign the straps to fit.When I called Bowflex and warned them that this is a recipe for injury and the ensuing lawsuits, they simply said they knew what I was referring to and have not had any complaints. They also said they had no reason to change it unless more people were to complain or injure themselves. I told her it was a backward way of doing business. I also warned her that I would put the facts on youtube."
3,Not so great,"I bought the bowflex 1090 about a month ago. At first I really liked them until the locking mechanism got stuck. After figuring out how to rotate the dumbbell back to normal I was happy again. Then, one of the dumbbells was not locking like it should causing some weights to fall off. This really sucks when you have to do repairs in the middle of your workout. I think one needs to go in for repair but I am still using it with special care. I love the things other than the above mentioned problem."
1,Used for two weeks and a weight broke off.,One of the weights broke off. There's a latch that keeps each weight in place and the plastic stressed and the weight dropped. I have one used old design and it works fine. I'll look for another used one.
3,OK but...,"I have purchased a number of these dumbbells and they are great for home use. However, I also have them for our gym at the office and they are constantly being damaged by carelessness and the plates are expensive to replace every time a 5 cent clip breaks from misuse. Bowflex needs to fix these flimsy clips."
3,Fragile,"For something so heavy it seems very fragile. I am not a huge fan of dropping weights, but it would be of comfort to know that I could if I needed to."
4,"Great, But Not Perfect","Let's cut to the chase...if you don't have the space or cash for an entire rack of dumbbells, you should definitely buy these.Pros-The positives of these weights are obvious, space savings cost savings.Here are some areas of the SelectTech 1090s that I think can be improved upon.1. The grip. The grip is extremely abrasive compared to other dumbbells2. You have to be very precise when putting the weights back in their cradle. If you don't line up the weight just right, it won't slide into the cradle and you'll have to maneuver it a bit to get it to slide in. When your arms are exhausted and you're holding a heavy weight, this can be tough.3. Occasionally when you dial in your weight on the dumbbell it won't lock in right and it will try to pick up all 90 lbs when you have clearly only dialed in say 40 lbs. So you have to adjust the dial again and pull up. This doesn't happen often.Overall I am happy with my purchase but I think Bowflex has some tweaking to do."
4,If you like Yamantaka Eye...,"This is one guy with no instruments doing things with the human voice that few save schizophrenic mental patients and Yamantaka Eye of the Boredoms can spew forth. Babbling, screaming, droning, groaning. The first track, ""Zakuro"" is so amazingly hilarious you won't stop grinning for days. Tzadik rules, as usual."
2,Will men PLEASE stop pretending they can think like women,"""I wanted to sketch the vaginas of every girl in my class.""Oh yeah, that's how a 14-year-old female talks/writes.I've been one. I've known many.I've read many works by Lester, and I've read many many books by men pretending they can get in the minds of females. You can't. Please stop.The book had a great premise (2 stars) and was completely unconvincing just the same."
1,Stop,"When Dad Killed Mom by Julius Lester was boringly predictable. The title gave away too much, if I had not read the title the book would have been more exciting and it would have been more fun to read it. Personally I do not enjoy books that are predictable and boring, but I would recommend it to someone who was square and enjoyed reading something unentertaining (that's just my opinion). It was also kind of weird like with the whole bathroom stall thing and stuff. It was interesting to read about their very messed up situation but all in all it was kind of deranged and freaky and something I don't like to read about in my free time. I had to read it for an assignment and I probably would have stopped reading it after like the first chapter if I had a choice."
1,Get a Clue!!!!!,"I am appalled!This book not only disurbed me but made me sad and angry as well. I am anrgy that anyone would find this book appropriate for ages 12 and up.It saddens me to think that an award winning author would want to expouse children to the details in this book. The language is bad enough,but I could have lived with that. The underlying incestual comments and accusations wanted to make me scream and nowhere in the book does it say or let a 12 year old child know that this is inappropriate behavior. This book was depressing to me especially thinking of the middle school age children that have or will read this book and have no one to discuss the disturbing content with. Parents need to be VERY AWARE about allowing this book to be read by their impressionable teens and preteens.. AT THE VERY LEAST READ IT FIRST so you can discuss the book with your children."
3,Oedipal and Electra Complex,"Although Lester's novel, ""When Dad Killed Mom"" has an appealing topic (a death of a parent), it seems as if Lester devotes much of his attention to the Oedipal and Electra complex. Because of this, I would recommend this novel to mature adolescent readers. I would also discuss these two complexes lack of validity."
5,***amazing***,"hi, i'm 13, and i started this book last night. i finished it at 5am. i couldn't put it down. it was so amazing. what i really liked about it was that it was written in the childrens' point of view, and it's very realistic. for example, the girl, jenna curses all the time and stuff, but that's the way it is in real life. i hate when books make it seem like all kids are all 'goodie too shoes' the feelings and emotions are very real and i recommend this to anyone. it was terrific."
4,Wow!,I have read a lot of books but this is one of the best by far. Lester's portral of jeremy and Jenna's reaction's to their mother's death is amazing!
2,Expected More,"Upon purchasing this book I thought it would be very indepth and full of emotion. I found it to be more superficial than anything else. Still read it, you may find it more appealing."
2,Could've been better.,"I thought that the book was only OKAY, because there were some parts that I believed were gross and kind of sexual. The book was about a teenage girl and her younger brother who have to deal with their dad killing their mother. The book switches from Jenna's (the girl) point of view to Jack's point of view(the boy). In my eyes Jenna was a mean little brat to her mom, although Jack seemed to love his mom and respect her. Jenna was into GIRLS and their bodies. Jack loved to paint just like his mom, so when she died he took over her studio and went there to paint and to think of her in the hard times he endured."
2,A Mediocre Modernization of a Classic Tale,"I came into this book with high expectations, but found myself very much let down. The plot was unsurprising, with a series of affairs and abandoned children, and in that it evoked Oscar Wilde's classic ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", one of the great gothic plays of all time. Unfortunately, whereas Wilde's play has touchingly poigniant scenes as the truth comes out, for instance when Jack realizes he has been telling nothing but truth his whole life, and comments on how terrible this is, this book seems to make light of the gravitas and realism of its premise, particularly in the courtyard scene. I reccomend it only for serious Wilde scholars."
5,Unforgettable,"I bought this for my teenage granddaughter. It was recommended to her and she said she couldn't put it down. I haven't read it, but she said it was good."
4,You gotta read this book.,"""When Dad Killed Mom"" is a tale aobut two kids who go to school one day and it is totally normal and they find out later that their dad has killed their mom. If you like books that you can't put down then this is the book for you. Julius Lester sure knows how to write page turner."
1,Didn't work for me...,"The item description doesn't tell you how big the map is when unfolded. I was surprised to find that the entire United States is displayed on a sheet that is barely bigger than a legal size sheet of paper. The map itself is only 9 1/2 inches from east to west -- I can cover the entire map with my outstretched hand. Thus the crowded Northeast section of the country is so small and packed with data that you'll probably need a magnifier to see much. And in such a small size, there is almost no detail; the only highways marked are the major interstates. If you aren't sure that Nebraska is north of Kansas or that Idaho is east of Oregon, this might be what you need. Otherwise, I suggest looking for something larger and with some useful detail."
2,Dances around the heart of the matter,"This book really didn't work for me. The author is clearly inspired about the topic of improvisation, but there's such a lack of depth and rigor to his exploration that the book came off to me as a lightweight, new-agey sermon. Nachamanovitch dances around the subject with gusto, but he always avoids diving deeply into the heart of the matter."
1,must have music book,this book is absolute a must for shy musicians who want to play in jamsessions or in other public places.It is a mix from bhudist thoughts and daily life.It gaves me more selfconfidence in playing and acting.
1,Writing this review is a better use of time than reading this book,"I have to read some chapters from this book for my class at College, but I decided it would be a better use of my time to review it on Amazon instead. I would not recommend it. You could even have my copy when I'm done with this class."
5,This book can change your life!,"I love this book. I have read this highly readable book more than 25 times in the last five years. So much that I took its message to heart, as I will specify below. The book suggests inspiring stories, tips, and lessons for making yourself more flexible at the core. Let Go - this is the central message of the book. Letting go of our preconceived notions can improve our sense of autonomy, and help us play freely the game of life. Like a god. On one inspired moment after reading this book, earlier this year, I let go of this great book. So it won't any longer be a crutch I hold on to in every moment of difficulty. I have recommended this book to all my friends."
5,Deep and satisfying,"A feel for the deep insides of creativity, no matter what path you walk in life. Life can be lived as art, and this book shows you how. Every page a blessing."
4,Free Play for Life,This book has many reasons why someone should just let go and see and feel life through a different lense.
3,The book is great but...,"I too agree that this is a great book. However, the one I purchased on here is missing multiple pages from some of the chapters. The pages are literally ripped out which is unfortunate considering I am reading this book for class."
4,Heavy but worth it,"Free Play is intellectual and heavy going, but if you take your time and let the concepts settle into your mind, it's worth it. NOT a quick read, not light reading. No way is this a how-to book. Nachmanovitch has read more and thought more about the nature of creativity and art than a whole truckload of university professors, although he's probably also spent a zillion hours discussing it with that truckload of professors. This book could change your life if you are an artist of any sort and serious about it. I do mean any sort of artist - painters, sculptors, musicians, actors, composers, writers - all of us."
4,"For artists, or Anyone wishing to live creatively","A detailed, thoughtful exploration of the creative process and the requirements for true improvisation. Filled with references to both Western and Eastern ways of thought. A book of substance."
4,Got me thinkin',"THis publication is a descriptive diatribe on the ""cosmic"" nature of improvisation. It is not a manual that ""teaches"", but rather a collection of bits & pieces of information that are collaged together. There are good points in the book and it is extremely well written by a PHD holder who obviously is an expert in the field.I was hoping the book would be more of a manual of ""how to"" but it was still very useful as a ""mind opener"""
4,Anyone know anything about a video DVD?,"I saw the video for ""Since I Left You"" on channel 25 today. It's also online - well worth a peek.http://media.theonenetwork.com/plist33_asx.asp?type=music&speed;=300&videoid;=theavalanches_sinceileftyouI'd love to own a DVD copy. Anyone know where or how that may be made available?"
5,Brief Review,Timeless album that can't be categorized any more than it can be duplicated. Groundbreaking in its scope and anonymity. 'Since I Left You' is great.
5,Please make a new album,"It is hard to believe this album is as old as it is. I wish more bands made music this way. The whole album is an exotic trip for your ears. If you have checked out clips of this album, they do not do it justice it needs to be experienced in it's entirety. ( In other words don't buy mp3s)"
5,hm,Very progressive electronic sounds. Interesting listening experience... Wide range of samples. Lets say - a good one ;)
1,WHO SAID THIS IS BIG BEAT,I am wondering who is in charge of setting the tags and categories for the music here.This album is an absolute disaster. THIS IS NOT BIG BEAT MUSIC NOT AT ALL.
3,Overrated,"What a dissapointing album. I bought it simply because people comapared The Avalanches to The Propellerheads, and that is a terrible comparison. The Avalanches are like a funkier version of Thievery Corporation. They are nothing like The Go Team or The Propellerheads, other than they use samples. The album TRIES to be fun, but it fails. It's not an album to drive to, it's not fun or fast paced. It's trip-hop and ambient, it's not drum and bass nor breakbeat. It's not closely related to techno. I was really dissapointed, even after my 20th listen to the album. I thought it would grow on me, and it hasn't."
1,No customer service at all.,"I bought one from a reseller and it leaks under household water presure, seller asked me to contact the manufacture, manufacture does not respond at all. So I ended up with an expensive leaking plastic bottle.If you must buy one of these, make sure you can return it in case of problem."
1,EZ-Flo Garden Hose Injector,"EZ-Flo Garden Hose InjectorI would like to return this injector, it dose not apply fertilizer at a constant rate."
4,Its difficult to review,"Its difficult to review -- i really like DP since i was a child. There is a special feeling for this band. I cannot be objective judging a band that means a lot to me. I like the album. I know that maybe Gillan's voice is now a little weak, that Morse is different to Blackmore (note : Not best or worst, just different), that i miss Jon Lord a lot.. but it is still Deep Purple and i really like it. As i mentioned above : Cannot be objective. However, i recommend this album to everyone. ""Rapture of the Deep"" is one of the best song ever in the history of the band. I mean it. Highly recommended."
3,spill and spell review,It's a really fun game. The only problem I can see is that the timer should measure off a bit more time. The timer that came with the game is really of much too short a duration. Thank you!
3,Music for the brave!,"The idea of this CD is much like the style of John Cage. If you take a piano and insert various objects in between the strings, you produce an array of unusual sounds. This process is called a prepared piano. Well, Tome has done somewhat the same thing, but with a CD. By placing pieces of tape on random areas of a CD, a resulting sound is a series of stuttering noices and silence, and the result would be different each time the CD is played. This is definitely not for mainstream audiences. Most people would be turned off by something like this (I wouldn't even listen to it all the time). However, if you are the adventurous type and/or interested in experimental music, it's worth checking out."
1,Missing many details,"This book seem to cover most of the topics about Visual Cafe 2.0,but most of the important details were left out. The author tried to attract the buyers with the fancy content and introduction."
2,"great, inexpensive amp with rare feature UPDATE:poor quality","UPDATE: after about 3 years of very gentle use, the amp failed. I suspect faulty power supply capacitors. Very poor quality, I have never had an amplifier that failed like this, most of the time I upgrade for new features. Very sadOriginal:I purchased this amplifier on a whim because it features surround sound decoding matrix called Circle Surround (it decodes FL, FR, FC, SL, and SR channels from a single stereo input). I much prefer Circle Surround to any Dolby product.This amplifier, aside from rare decoding, offers DD, DTS, and PCM digital decoding and has very quiet amplifiers for each channel. The amplifier is also very user friendly to set up and use. Furthermore, it provides me enough digital and A/V inputs."
5,Great for Adults Too,"I gave this book to my entire business unit. I think most books on business, how to make a company better, etc. make things too complicated. If you really read each point in this book, it just applies to everything we do in both our personal and business lives. It's how I want my co-workers to behave and treat others. Take for example, the first one- ""Jump right in or you might change your mind about swimming."" In other words- Sometimes don't anaylze too much, just do it. Or ""Ask why until you understand""- In other words, if you don't understand, keep talking until everyone does.....etc.. A GREAT BOOK!"
5,Great Words of Wisdom!!,"This is a wonderful book. It is full of wisdom we sometimes forget as we get older. I have given it as gifts to many people for graduations, and birthdays. I appreciate the words and have re-read this book quite often."
5,Great collection of wise words,Great collection of wise words from children. Makes a wonderful gift for parents and teachers.Simple sayings but filled with childlike wisdom.
5,The kids loved it!,"As a second grade teacher at the closing of the school year, I found it difficult to keep my students on task and learning. However, after obtaining two Science Spiders books, I was able to provide the children meaningful and fun activties that kept them engaged and learning. The last week of school, we made salt and flour volcanoes, put in the baking soda, and added red food colored vinegar to watch them erupt (as outlined in ""Surprise Explosions""). The children were delighted with their volcanoes and took them home. Then out of the ""Secret Tricks"" book, we tried to lift a yardstick with a newspaper covering it (broke the yardstick), and the kids just roared as kid after kid and finally me, tried to blow a piece of paper into a bottle. I now plan to purchase the rest of the series for use in September. I'll also be recommending this series to our district science committee."
3,You buy this for the 2 piano chamber,"As the Borodin in the SQ3 is not up to par with the excellent,may I use that subjective term , definitive :-) Kronos/complete sq's/Nonesuch. Schnittke presents too many difficulities for this group to match the Kronos.The piano quintet is very well performed. As the review below notes, Ludmilla Berlinsky is stunning on piano, the music rises above the actual instruments, the Borodin seems to pick up on her leading and fairs better in both the piano chmaber here.The piano quartet is raely recorded and if you are a fan of the romantic era(which mostly I'm not) you'll really enjoy this Mahler/Schnittke piano quartet.I think I'd give it 4 STARS now that I'm editing this review."
1,Unable to Load Software,"Unfortunately, my Operating System (Windows XP) is too current to load this software, so the product has been useless."
4,Another fine book back in the days when Hawai'i Five-0 was the best tv show on!,"Superbly written Robert Bowen, Five-0book with well illustrated cover withMcGarrett and Danno (the James MacAr-thur one!). Highly recommended! Whenis the feature filn gonna finally comeout?!"
5,An Irreverent Romp,"A fascinating, heart-warming book that takes an irreverent look at Jesus' adult life and ministry. Although it is long (619.5 pages in paperback), the story easily carries you along and bids you to keep turning the pages so that you don't miss a thing.I really enjoyed ""The Passion of Mary Magdalen"" and the prequel (""Magdalen Rising"") wasn't too bad either. (I think the best part is that there aren't any consistency errors between the two books!) I wish Ms. Cunningham would hurry up and finish ""Bright Dark Madonna""--I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to know how Maeve's story ends...especially since she finally goes back to Pretannia! (Hopefully to confront the druids...even if the only ones left are her friends and classmates!)"
5,This is a great book,I picked up this book because it did have an irreverent slant. I'm not quite finished but I love this book and will be recommending to everyone. If you are very strict in your religious views on Christianity you probably won't like this book. It made these biblical people more human and real. It actually makes me want to read a Bible to see what was written compared to this fictional tale.
5,"Breathtaking and heartwarming, this book touches the soul...","This is one of the most powerfuland beautifully written books I have ever encountered, andbrings to mind the powerful and beautiful women I have hadthe honor of encountering in my lifetime. I hope you willread it. I also hope you will be able to meet the author inperson, when she visits a city near you on her book tour.She is a real delight!"
5,Mary Maglalen,"Fantastic story and detailed narrative! If you loved the Mists of Avalon, you'll love this! Great book to read over the winter..."
1,A Low-Brow Romance,"Nothing more need be said. If this is your genre, and you like a feminist slant, you will like this book. If you don't want to waste your time reading drivel, skip it.Illustrates the problem with on-line purchasing of unknown works. I never would have bought this book if I'd been able to peruse it, as one can in a bookstore."
5,Good High Energy Workout Music,"This cd is not by the original artist and the songs are sometimes very slightly different in beat from the ""radio"" versions so that the beat is 125 to 135 per minute. There is a good selection of music and I guarantee you won't be able to sit still when you play the music. My form of exercise is dancing in the livingroom and this really helps me keep my heart rate in a good target zone."
1,You get what you pay for!,The first story was so boring and senseless that I couldn't read all of it. I didn't even try another story. I shouldn't complain because it cost me nothing.
5,very informative,"I am a student at West Virginia State College University. I am in Mr. Samples, Children's Literature class. I chose to read this book as an honor book for a caldecott winner. I am not a huge dinosaur fan, but I loved this book. It made it even more fabulous that it is all based on a true story. The pictures were just as great as the book."
4,Pretty good monopod,"I bought this monopod for my wife's d5000, and she likes it a lot. I think it may be a little bit too much plastic, and the quick release plate doesn't match her slik tripod. Otherwise, it does the trick."
3,Singers a little mature,"I was expecting a typical Broadway Kids album but was surprised at the maturity of the voices and the adults on the CD cover. Surely these are BK alumni rather than current members!! The quality of the voices is not always the best, but the karaoke section is quite respectable and acceptable for, say, vocal recitals."
1,music again !!!!,"more new age nonesense diluting and destroying whale sounds, why do they do it ? money, because without the whales the music is laid bare as the droolings of utter mediocrity and they have no marketing angle. they are implying that whales arent good enough by themselves, ii needs their masterpice music to reveal the real meaning of whale sound ha ha ha !!! when in reality its the othe way round, whales dont get royalties so i suggest a donation to WWF instead of buying this drivel."
5,Dinner Party: The New Entertaining,I go back to this cookbook time and again and I am never disappointed.
2,"good intention and useful, but disastrous C++ example code","I agree mostly with the other reviewers to say that this book is useful to someextent for its brief review of molecular simulation and more so for the chapteron object oriented programing.However, I am really annoyed by the bad job done on the actual C++ examplecode. While the class structure done in UML seems OK, the actual code is of avery bad style and very misleading. I object to the fact that the code is still fartoo procedural and encapsulation and information hiding have not really beenused at all. I found this really misleading, since I wanted to use the code and adaptit to my own needs. There are some pretty dodgy style conventions also, such asthe inclusion of header files in header files, inconsistent class structure.Beginners beware and keep a proper C++ for scientists and engineers bookon the side."
1,"Disappointed, stock discontinued.","I was appreciably disappointed that Amazon could not deliver on the matching queen bed set ordered. After stringing me along a month that the queen set was coming, Amazon abruptly announced it was unavailable. I went directly to manufacturer Rose Tree who advised this line is a discontinued one. I was able to find the matching queen set at Dillards, but at a substantial price increase over the Amazon order."
5,Two presidents not compared often enough,"""John Milton Cooper...blends these contrasting and kindred elements into a masterful portrait of two of our most intriguing presidents,"" David Kennedy in the New York Times Book Review, November 20 1983. TR and Wilson are often considered to be the same, especially in the in the domestic realm. The New Freedom was simply an extension of New Nationalism. But Cooper espouses the differences through analysis of both important domestic debates and the politics of war and internationalism. For anyone interested in studying Roosevelt, Wilson, and the Progressive era this book is an important read."
3,An interesting read but requires prior knowledge,I read this book for my history class at The University of San Francisco. It is worth reading if you want a very in depth look at the lives and careers of both Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. The only problem with the book is that it assumes you are already knowledgeable about this era. I found it very helpful to read a history textbook along with the book in order to better understand what was happening at this point in history. Otherwise the book was well written and easy to read. I recommend The Warrior and The Priest to anyone who is interested in the exciting life of TR and his rival Wilson.
3,Basic Insight into Roosevelt and Wilson,"Warrior and Priest, by John Milton Cooper, Jr. is a basic overview of the lives of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. If you have read any other works on these two men, then this book will be a disappointmnet. I have read extensively about Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and found this account to quite boring and tedious. I would only recommend this book to a reader who is totally unfamiliar with these two great Americans."
1,Utter Nonsense,"Don't waste any money or time on this alleged book. It's nothing more than technobabble, and a poor example of that. The author obviously has spent considerable time on his theories; however, he glosses over flaws or, more often, conveniently ignores them. Pretending errors in one's work don't exist is not part of the scientific method."
4,Good folk music sampler. Same tracks as another CD,"This album is of Bhutanese and some Tibetan folk music. It is a good sampling of a bunch of different folk instruments and singing styles.This album, called ""volume 2"" on its spine, is EXACTLY the same as another CD with a different title ""Tibetan Bhuddist Rites form the Monasteries of Bhutan, volume 4"":Tibetan Buddhist Rites From The Monasteries Of Bhutan Volume 4: Tibetan & Bhutanese Instrumental and Folk Music. Very confusing as one is named vol 2 and the other vol 4. Both comprise an identical set of recordings made by John Levy in 1971. The one on this page is a few dollars more expensive as of this writing. Both have 99% the same liner notes, albeit in different formats (this one a foldout, the other one a booklet)."
3,"Watchable,","but closer to borderline. It Ain't no Mondo Cane, for sure. (Then again, Mondo Cane 2 wasn't any Mondo Cane, either). However, there's enough here to keep it relatively interesting, and with Boris narrating, it's never dull! For the price, it's worth it!"
4,i don't know jack,"I don't know jack about jazz music or mingus but I do know that walrath played with charles mingus and carries on a lot of his independent and hard to pin-down spirit and that the first track is a revisit to a piece he wrote for charles mingus quintet that appeared on ""changes two"" cd. a lot of critics liked this cd but i find it hard to get."
4,Good product!,"This product is exactly what they promoted, and It came to my house very quickly. I gave it 4 stars because i like the product and the shipment was accurate and quickly."
4,Great little tripod,"This is a very nice, small, inexpensive tripod that will work well with small camcorders or DSLR cameras. It is somewhat fluid, however it is a far cry from a 501 fluid head that I have on my Manfrotto. If you really want fluid shots for panning, this is not the best tripod for you and although it will be more money, I would recommmend that you invest in a well built Manfrotto or similar brand which you may be able to find on craigs list at a decent price in your area.This sony tripod is good for the occasional pan and tilt, and if you are planting your tripod and letting the camera role this is a great option. This is also great for travelling being that it is small and perfect for photography. I hope this helps!!!"
3,Not shattering but sharp,"It is easy to fault a few of Zorn's ideas as being completely sensationalistic without compositional merit to back it up, but even if there is a bit of that here as well, Kristallnacht works from a varied palate and is paced well enough to effectively produce an attainable avant-garde journey as opposed to some of his fractured output which doesn't compute a total."
3,Well-executed,"Great concept musically, but Zorn loses respect for ripping off the brainchild from Gary Lucas, who conceived the idea two years earlier with his original song, ""Verklarte Kristallnacht "" performed in Berlin to an enthusiastic crowd and rave reviews. Zorn should at least have the integrity to credit Lucas."
2,Looks Great but Terrible Receiver,"A beautiful looking tabletop radio in its wooden cabinet, but a poor receiver. Many FM and AM stations in my area (Eugene, OR) would not come in clearly. I tried several different antennas and different locations in my house with the same result. Other ordinary tabletop radios in our house have no problem pulling in these same stations. A big disappointment."
2,AM reception disappointing,I bought this for AM DXing. I was looking for the exceptional reception in the write-up. I have a $25 radio which is just as good. I only useit for AM so I cannot speak to the FM performance.
2,Not even close to a Bose,"I bought this radio based on all the great reviews it received. Reviewers raved about the sound and how it picks up so many channels. I needed a radio for my porch and was convinced by all these reviews that it would do as well or better than Bose for a much lower price. I was tired of moving my Bose back & forth from the kitchen. So I got it today, plugged it in, set the channels and found that it did not pick up many of the FM channels my old Bose brought in clearly. Then I compared the two side by side for sound quality. The Sangean does not have the fullness or quality of sound of the Bose. I am sending it back and will put out the extra money for another Bose."
2,hate it.,"My Boston Acoustics radio died. Super simple to operate with aa battery backup and amazing sound. Great reception. Set the alarm - press the alarm button and twist the dial. Set the clock - press the clock button and twist the dial. Soft orange non offensive easy to see non sleep disrupting digital readout. Extremely disappointed that it had been discontinued and knew it would be hard to replace that perfect little beauty.Chose this one. What a nightmare of complicated programming. 14 buttons and 2 knobs on the front. Where's the one labeled time, to set the clock? Where's the one labeled alarm, to set the alarm? Just a bunch of cryptic labels like ""set"" I'm not an Apple fan and don't own any apple stuff outside of an old iPod but I finally understand where Steve Jobs rage against buttons was coming from. My wife wants to know if the alarm is set. I can's say with any confidence that it is. We'll find out in the morning."
4,Good but not intuitive,"I do like this radio - it has good sound. It does have good features although Imostly use it for NPR while I'm at the computer. I love the remote. I would definitely buy it again.Buyers should know (and some sellers mention this) that the color is not what anyone would call walnut. It's lighter in color and closer to unfinished maple than blond oak or maple.My one (very small) complaint is that there is no reason to make any device which requiresone to read the manual to set the clock. Other than that, you could plug this in anduse it without ever being forced to read the manual. All devices should have threededicated buttons -hour, minute and am/pm in my very humble opinion."
5,A Real Radio,"I wanted an ""old-fashioned"" table radio. I did some research and ended up with the Sangean WR-2. I am VERY pleased with it. Not too big or too small, sleek and simple design and blends in with the room. Great sound and I really like having a remote for it! I'm glad they are still making table radios in this day of advanced technology where everything is tiny and has earpieces. Thank you."
2,Excellent radio; Terrible clock-radio alarm.,"Radio has excellent sound, and pulls in weak stations; HOWEVER, the alarm clock radio is extremely inconvenient to use. If you want to disarm the alarm so it doesn't wake you on Saturday morning, you have to go through four steps to do so. All of the buttons are identical, and the labels are very difficult to read. If you want to change your wake-up time, you have to go through six steps. Plan on having the Owner's Manual in one hand while you push confusing buttons with the other. I use the Sangean to go to sleep by, but keep a more convenient and reliable clock radio on the other side of my bed to wake me in the morning.Also, some of the features are only available in Europe, so I paid for some features I can't use. Great sound, but you might find more convenient performance at a lower price."
5,Great radio,"I purchased this radio (Sangean WR-2 Digital AM/FM Tabletop Radio, Walnut) for use at work. With other less expensive radios I had a hard time receiving a radio signal, not with this unit. It has a great audio quality. I would highly recommend this radio to anyone who wants a high quality sound in a radio that is not overly expensive."
5,the best of mono,I could not have been more pleased.The sound fills the room and is crystal clear. We use it in the Dining room during breakfast and it sounds great. I was going to go with analog but I am glad I didn't. I had thought about stereo and I'm glad I went with mono.
3,"Great as a radio, not so great as a clock","I bought this to replace both my alarm clock and bedroom radio in one, and it delivers on half of that equation. It has great sound both for radio broadcasts and iphone, without broadcasting interference from the phone. The looks are nicer than the all plastic clock/radios, like the ihome, and the remote is very useful. However, even on the lowest setting the backlight is strong enough to read by at 4-6 feet away, which is like leaving a light on by your head while you try and sleep. This means we generally leave the backlight fully off, so the clock can't be read at all until you turn it on. Also, as several folks have noted, the default setting is to display the station info, which means you are sleepily fumbling around with the remote to figure out what time it is when you wake up. I researched and returned alot of options before settling on this clock/radio and I still think it is the best of a mediocre field."
5,Nifty Radio,"After much ado with getting Amazon to accept my credit card, or vice versa, I got my radio and it's just what I wanted. Easy to use and attractive cabinet with good reception and sound. It has pre set station ability and I like that, too."
4,perfect bedside companion,This clock/radio is a perfect fit on the bedside table. It has great sound. Easy to program. The one drawback is that you cannot see both the time and radio stations at the same time. You have to push a button to see the time seperately. Another plus is that you can set the backlight to various options including off. We got rid of the old radio because the light kept us awake! I highly recommend this unit to anyone. Very nice!
3,Sangean Tabletop radio,I wear glasses and the display is very difficult to see without putting my glasses on--which I normally don't have to do with LED displays. Sound quality is good. The Boston Acoustics version worked much better for me.
4,remote problem but fantastic radio,"Great sound-- clear + crisp!! I bought it for my elderly mother to place on top of the fridge in the kitchen. Since she is only 4ft 11 inches the remote control was an easy solution for her to turn the radio off/on and manage the stations, After 4 months the remote died. A replacement battery didn't seem to remedy the situation. Not sure where to buy a replacement remote."
2,Sangean WR-2 Sound Stopped After 9 Months,"I bought this radio through Amazon in May, 2012, and really liked it. However, 9 months later, the sound has stopped working (February 2013). All the RDS, etc., still works, so it's receiving the signal. Just no sound. I was using the FM antenna that came with it, but when the sound stopped I hooked it up to my giant FM antenna (in the attic). Still no sound...I'm going to send it in to Sangean since it's still under warranty, but I would think this radio should last longer than 9 months. I will update this review with the results of returning the product."
2,Be Aware!,"If you want this to use next your bed - i listen to Coast to Coast AM-with George Noory- I advise you to get something else. This has a blinding blue light that will light up your room when the power is on. They must have done this so you could easily find the power button at night, but I'm not exagerating-you will feel like you are in a neon lighted porn district in Amsterdam when you see how this lights up your room. I through out the box and will have to try and sell this for whatever I can get on ebay.Also, while the reception is better then a normal radio-it is not great. If you want better-they make you buy a antenna add-on-what a rip off. I had a big klunky GE Super tuner $45 and it was better the this. Another thig is whe you touch any of the buttons on the front you will experience static.this should be priced around $80 for what you get."
2,Very poor am receiption on sangear WR-2,"I am returning my second Sangean WR-2 radio. I reordered because I did not believe that a radio that cost that much could have almost nonexistant AM recieption. I tried an external antenna with little improvement. We are in a remote area, however, A 40 year old radio and a $18 dollar boom box both received a usable AM signal in exactly the same location. I bought this for a xmas present for my wife who likes to listen to talk radio. I thought she would like the many nice features on this radio. The FM has good sound. This is the only reason I gave it a two star rateing. They apparently forgot that you have to receive a signal before you can make it sound good."
2,Even the company can't make the alarm work!,"I'm a smart girl and thought I could get the alarm to work despite the instructions written by someone who is not fluent in English. After weeks of trying on my own, I got a company rep on the phone (in California). He fiddled with his unit but couldn't get the alarm to sound.It's a lovely item, and the sound and reception are superb. But without an alarm, it's doing less than half the job."
2,Not as great as the reviews say,The small orange power-on button has a very bright white half moon glow on it. It's irriating at night as if some one has cracked open the bedroom door. Original purchase and this replacement that I received are both like this. Weird design for such a costly Taiwan made radio to have a button that looks like someone never finished coloring the plastic orange on button. Rich deep bass sound but you never can crank up the volume if you want to blast a song. Volume dial goes up to 60 on the dial but it's not much louder than when the dial is set a third lower at 40 on the volume dial. Like the white enclosure as it matches my white kitchen applicances where I moved the radio to.
4,good quality radio but poor number contrast,We are quite happy with the radio except that the black contrast for the time & stations is poor & you have to be fairly close to make it out against the backlight.
5,Sangean WR-2 Digital AM/FM Tabletop Radio,Purchased for my mother. She needed something easy to operate. This radio has very good rich sound for a small unit. It is very easy to operate with lots of extra features.
4,What I hoped it would be,"I was looking for a radio that gets good reception with a quality sound and is simple to operate for my kitchen. This radio accomplishes those goals. To be sure I purchased an external AM/FM antenna at the same time . Although this radio has better reception than my previous radio, I get even better FM reception with the external antenna."
3,"""Enclosure"" is not ""wooden;"" it's plastic!","Given the desciption of this radio, I was disappointed to find that it has a plastic, not a wooden, case. And the settings (e.g., of alarms) are unnecessarily complex, as many people say."
3,OK Radio,"When I selected this radio, I was looking for a radio only - not a clock radio, not stereo, not a receiver, etc. The Sangean WR-2 was as close as I could find. I would rate its ability to pull in stations about average. Adjacent channel rejection/selectivity/station drift is excelent. Sound quality and general apperance is very good. Features which have no value to me are the clock radio function (complicated - if I had wanted a clock radio, I would not have kept this one) and the traffic function (silly). All this amounts to an average rating of 4 stars for me but . . .There are two items that made the unsatisfactiory list and lowered my rating to three stars. First is the RDS display. It flashes a continual series of jumbled letters the entire time the radio is on (even if I turn it off, it returns the next time I turn on the radio). My second issue is that the price is too high. A fair price for this table top radio would be about $60."
3,Sangean WR-2 Digital AM/FM Tabletop Radio Reception,"Sangean WR-2 Digital AM/FM Tabletop Radio, Walnut is a nice radio with sounds and looks. This radio was supposed to be good for long range reception, it does not. You will also have to purchase an extra antenna. I do not know if the extra antenna does provide the long range reception area."
5,"Great Sound, Intelligent Design","I own 3 Sangean clock-radio's (love the warm sound) and this is my favorite. I like the classic design, and all the functions are easy to use. I wish there were more RDS stations in Boston area that gave traffic info (are there any in the U.S.?), but not Sangean's fault.Alarm isn't really that hard to figure out, but I don't use it because I like to have ability to have different alarm times for weekend (which other Sangean's offer). Too bad, as this would be a great bedside unit since you can turn off the backlight completely with a dedicated button."
3,Too Unfriendly for this user,The sound is great.Alarm system is hopeless.Does not display time without changing the screen which is highly inconvenient.Screen is too bright for use in a bedroom.I regret that I did not heed the reviews on the alarm system and look harder for a different radio.CG
1,"Lovely to look at, but miserable AM reception","The old radio we had in the kitchen when I was growing up achieved better AM reception than this. Even the radio in my cheap car (Hyundai Sonata) gets better AM than this.I live in a rural area without sources of interference. The radio is on the second floor, near a window. The building is wood-framed. There is no possible excuse for the pathetic performance of this radio! And, yes, I tried an external AM antenna.After dark, it does not, and apparently cannot, discriminate between distant stations. Rotating the radio (to orient the internal ferrite rod antenna) makes only a marginal difference.During daytime, a station that I can hear clearly on my car radio comes in with enough background hiss to be almost unlistenable on the Sangean.All the money seems to have gone into the box, which is very nicely done. But I didn't buy a radio just to look at it."
5,great radio,"everything as advertised. arrived days before promised time, well packed, everything in perfect condition. i'm very happy with this radio. one puzzling thing: how is it that all my favorite FM stations were already programmed with the pre-set buttons? are you psychic? or did someone else use it before me? hmmmmm.nevertheless, i have no complaints."
5,great radio,"I'm going to keep it simple. I own a Bose radio and this Sangean. Hands down the Sangean wins. It sounds better and it's a lot cheaper. Even if they were the same price, I would choose the Sangean."
1,This is NOT a HD (Hyper-Digital) Radio,"I wanted a HD Radio that would receive all three HD channels recently offered by my local NPR station. I went to Amazon and searched for 'tabletop HD radio'. The first item that came up was this Sangean radio, which I ordered. Upon arrival, I found that it would not receive the three HD channels. I called Amazon who referred me to the state-side wholedaler who advised that the radio is digital but NOT HD (Hyper Digital). The wholesaler said that he had received several similar calls, so I'm not the only one who was misled by the Amazon listing. I returned the radio to Amazon for a full refund, and then bought a used Polk Audio ISonic HD radio through Amazon, which was considerably more expensive, but receives three HD channels offered by NPR and several other stations. I think this Sangean is probably a fine digital radio, but it did not meet my needs because it is not HD."
2,Sangean WR-2 review,The radio did not meet my expectations. The wood was not even close to a walnut look. The reception was marginal. I did not consider it to be user friendly.
1,sangean digital Radio,I purchased this radio for my husband as a birthday gift and the radio is too complicated for the two (ederly amateurs) of us to operate. It was terribly frustrating and my husband is an attorny and I am a college graduate. The directions in the booklet would not even help us with the time setting.We happyily returned the item to your Amazon Returns address.By the way your 1-900-226-5170 number is disconnected so that was not helpful in returning the item too. The radio cost around $139 with the mailing price and I hope I get all my money back. Do not sell that radio.Elaine Knox
5,Great Radio - Would buy again.,"I love this radio. The reception is great and I live in radio syberia. I would recommend this for AM/FM. I want to get a antenna, but so far I am pleased even without one."
4,Solid,"It is quite true, as an early review points out, that the procedure for setting the alarm on this unit is unnecessarily convoluted. But it is no more challenging than many of the complications that any computer owner deals with routinely. And this annoyance is overwhelmingly offset by the radio's overall quality. In appearance, sound, and control manipulation, it radiates solidity. The sound is effortlessly clear, and includes more deep bass than has any right coming out of a box that small."
4,WR-2 Humane Waking System is GREAT.,"I purchased this Sangean specifically for the HWS. It is soooo nice to be woken gently as the volume of the radio increases. That was worth the price by itself. Sound quality is very good from the front firing speaker. Operating instructions leave something to be desired. The unit is a bit large and heavy for a clock radio.Pros: Humane Waking System, attractive cabinet, very good sound quality, antennas included.Cons: Operating manual, tiny remote (I don't use it), somewhat complicated operation.Tips: I had trouble with the LCD display light illuminating and waking me instead of the music from the radio. Even at the dim setting it's like a landing light from an aircraft. To keep the lamp turned off when the alarm sounds be sure to have the display light in the off position when setting the alarm and when resetting it."
4,Very noce,"I bought this for my wife, as a kitchen radio. It works and sounds better than I expected. Reception is good without external antenna. I would recommend this radio to anyone who wants a compact stationary radio. I'm planning to hook-up my wife mp3 player to this radio also, but have not gotten around to it yet."
5,Excellent Radio,Completely happy with this purchase! Excellent reception of FM and AM - quality sound - many excellent features - I really like the remote control feature! Only negative is the radio speakers are not Stereo although the headset option is Stereo. A little pricey but worth it.
3,I'm returning it,"I had high expectations for the sound quality. However, I was disappointed. I hear bass, I hear highs, but nothing in the mid-tones. My ears are hungry for the well-rounded sound of Boston Acoustic, and I will probably buy another of that brand."
1,Not a HD radio!,"Not a bad unit, but much of the marketing is misleading, including Amazon's listing as a hit for ""HD radio"". Mine was given to me a year ago by someone who still thinks she gave me a HD radio."
1,what a rip off,first you need a EE degree to understand this monstrisity. it does not pick any radio stations as claimed . its way overpriced. its clunky-heavy and for no good purpose. save your money.boy am i sorry i bought this dud.
4,If I only lived in Europe - revisited,"I must admit, it's a nice looking radio. However, I have no idea how it sounds since mine arrived with a European power cord and I live in the US. It's heading back to Amazon and hopefully the replacement arrives with the proper power cord.UPDATE: Raising my rating from 1 to 4 stars. Once I received the correct US version, it turned out to be a nice radio. Great sound quality. Took away one star because the buttons and their functions are not intuitive. For example, I have to pull out the manual to do certain functions like reset the time for daylight savings."
4,AM,The AM mode is not as good as I thought it would be. Nice sound. easy to work. Nice looks. FM ok.
1,sent damaged units three times,"This looks like an excellent product, but I've had a terrible time trying to get an factory new one from sangean through amazon. The speaker was dented on the first; the case was dinged up on the second and third, clearly the result of prior use. When paying $140 for a glorified clock radio, I think it's fair to expect mint condition!"
2,poor design,"excellent fm, poor am. too many very small buttons. difficult to set and erase alarms. alarm buttons should be set on top of case. screen colors should be changed."
4,Great for the office,I am using this in my office on the 11th floor of an 18 floor office building and it gets great reception (unlike my last cheap alarm clock radio). It has good sound even without the stereo sound that is only available when using head phones. The only thing I wish it had were more presets. FM1 and FM2 like in a car would be great. Overall this is a great radio and I'd buy another.
4,Very impressive,Easy setup. Intuitive usage. Great sound for such a small unit. This was my second Sangean and I definitely recommend.
3,It keeps pulling electricity after turned off,"This radio has a nice look, but I don't like that the face stays illuminated after I turn it off. I have to think it's still taking electric. It only turns off when I unplug it. I purchased this as the area where I live gets only static in a regular radio. It's slightly stronger as I get a few stations. It's not what I hoped to find."
5,Good AM Reception,I have been looking for an AM radio with good reception for a while now. This one meets my needs. I'm using a 20' wire as an external antenna.
2,"There are a few good recipes, but...","There are some faves in this cookbook, but I find myself forever correcting her recipes, especially when it comes to length of time in the oven. I am making the tuna casserole right now, and it says to bake it for 25 min. At 20 min the cheese was exactly how it was described, but the cauliflower was still totally hard and uncooked! 20 min later, and I am still waiting... By now the cheese is getting burnt. This is not the only recipe that needs a lot of fixing. Good thing I know what I'm doing in the kitchen and can substitute and adjust cooking times as needed.I also agree with the odd ingredients that others have mentioned. I have probably only made about 10 or so recipes out of the whole book, partially because I don't know what half the ingredients are."
3,Good Cookbook,I haven't actually made anything from this cookbook! I either cannot find the ingredients or I would never use them. I'm not into using of a lot of fat in my cooking even though on the Atkins diet it's not a big deal. I'm just not going to use it and that renders most of the book useless to me. It's a very well written book and if you don't have a problem with what I've listed above then you will enjoy it very much.
5,I can't believe I can have this!,I have always loved sweets. It is what usually sabotaged my dieting attempts and my attempts to live a more healthly life. I made the Holiday Carmels from this book and I knew I was hooked. I have used both books by this author and found the information to be very helpful in watching my carbohydrate intake. I feel as if I can throw out all my other cook books with this one and her first one on my shelf!
5,Wonderful Cookbook!,"I began low carbing 6 months ago and I have to say that Sharon's book has made me forget I was ""dieting."" Wonderful tasting, easy to make recipes that are sure to satisfy even the non-low carber. I never feel like I am missing out on any food, because this book has it all. A wonderful book, fit even for this cooking challenged reader. A++"
5,Popping & locking will never go out of style!,The greatest display of breakdancing since Breakin'II: Electric Boogaloo! The group comes across as truly down-to-earth and warmly witty as well - real crowdpleasers and truly an inspiration. Let the bass kick!!!!
4,Fun soup bowls save my lunch when the phone rings.,These bowls are ideal for spaghetti or soup and so many things. I like the wide lip that helps prevent spilling and drippng. I also appreciate being able to reheat in the microwave. So often when I am having a nice bowl of soup on a cold day the phone rings and my meal gets cold. I don't like having to pour it out of the dish and reheat it then pour it back. Now I just pop it in the microwave and I'm back on track with lunch. I chose the periwinkle color but think I should try other colors too. They are fun to have around and easy to clean afterwards in the dishwasher.
5,Satin Sand Dune Flatware,I ordered this because of the good price and secure site. I was not disappointed. The package came very quickly and in good order. I would use your site again.
2,Use Once and Discard......,"I purchased these to sharpen chain saw blades. Very disappointed with their durability. After sharpening one chainsaw blade (16""), the diamond dust was essentially completely stripped off the shaft, rendering them useless for further sharpening. I'm going back to using the grinding stone version of the burrs . The stone wears, but at least I can sharpen the blade 5 or 6 times before having to replace the stone burr."
2,What'sThe Big Deal?,"I don't get the whole MENSA sponsored puzzle book thing. These books, and particularly this one, are just plain bad. Doesn't MENSA have any better puzzle writers than the ones currently writing? Isn't Terry Stickels a member of MENSA? Now his puzzle books have something to offer. Anyway, MENSA, you can do better."
2,Surely the answer is 5.5,"The question asks ""How many horses did the owner SELL"", not how many did he get rid of.Assuming (although not stated) that he ended up with no horses left:To the first purchaser, he SOLD 3.5 and GAVE AWAY 0.5.To the second, he SOLD 1.5 and GAVE AWAY 0.5.To the third, he SOLD 0.5 and GAVE AWAY 0.5.So the total number of horses he SOLD is 3.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5.5"
4,"Not bad, but not perfect","The watch face was a bit pinkier than I expected, and the band itself tends to wear more like a loose bracelet than a watch, but hey at $50 for a nice pulsar, what's to complain?"
2,Beware of Changed Title,"This 4-DVD set contains two Documentaries, but for some unknown reason, Millcreek Entertainment has changed the titles of them, superimposing new digital titles on the screen. The two documentaries should be called ""Crusade in the Pacific"" and ""Crusade in Europe,"" but inexplicably they're retitled ""War in the Pacific"" and ""War in Europe.""Also, Millcreek has placed their logo at periodic spots throughout each episode. Since these are public domain documentaries, there's plenty of other, intact editions available."
3,WWII Fan?,"If your idea of good television is World War II documentaries on the History Channel, then you'll like this item. A lot of the films included are US propaganda films from the war years but that gives a different (if skewed) angle. The quality is decent. You might want to go for one of the lower-priced ""new and used"" ones."
1,Deceptive,"If you are real World War 2 Fan , you will not appreciate it.I think it is taken from some propaganda films done for the troops.I am very disappointed."
4,An interesting fragment,"This slight novella tells the tale of Johannes Climacus, interspersing philosophical investigation with his personal information.Kierkegaard is considered the father of existentialism, and it is just as evident here. The attempt to impose a static philosophy on the process of becoming leads to philosophic untruth and irrelevance. There is something of aesthetic brilliance in the dialectical fortresses they construct, but no individual could ever be contained in those propositions.It is in the form of Johannes Climacus that Kierkegaard expresses his revelation. The book is skillfully constructed and witty.For someone interested in Kierkegaard's thought, but turned off by his monstrous, enigmatic books like Either/Or, I would recommend this book. This is philosophy that reaches the individual but never forces him into a system to regurgitate."
5,one of my favorite books,"I first read this book when I was probably 11 years old, and have read it I don't know how many times since then. Tristan Jones had the soul of a poet, as well as a natural ability to evoke the spirit of a bygone era seen through the eyes of a boy coming of age. Filled with colorful, sometimes heart-wrenching, often humourous anecdotes, this wonderful book has won a permanent place in my heart - very highly recommended."
1,Has a major problem,"The sidewinder controller just so happenes to be my favorite controller. Although I liek it because of how it can be used, there is a major defect with them. I warn you I went through 3 of these controllers and all of them broke within 6 months. The controller out of no where will start glitching and USB will not recognize its even plugged in. It will connect and disconnect about every other second.Although the controller is nice to use, because of its durability I rate it 1 star. Unless you don't mind replacing your controller every 6 months, than I will reccomend it."
2,Sappy Stooges at less than their best.,"THE HOT SCOTS; FUELIN' AROUND; and HULA-LA-LA are the three films packaged. Not top Stooges, but enough of their incomparable schtick comes through to make it worth buying."
1,ONE OF THE WORST 3 STOOGES TAPES EVER!!!,"These are definitely three of the WORST Three Stooges shorts ever. None of them are funny at all!!! Not once did I crack up laughing like I usually do. This is especially disappointing for those who are fans of Shemp like I am. These shorts were pathetically done. ""HULA-LA-LA"", which is the worst of the three, was pointless and did not make any sense at all. In fact, some of the main natives were played by white people who just happen to speak perfect English, which is VERY STRANGE and STUPID considering that they are supposed to be South Sea natives.I strongly advise any three stooges fan, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE!!! IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!!!...In fact, I would give it ZERO stars if I could."
3,"Really it's 2 stars, but I give it 3 for the DVD.","Thes guys are ok at best. The singer needs to go and the band members need to stop imitating Dave Matthews Band(sax especially). Also the whole reggae attempt is pretty weak( especially the ""reggae"" lyrics). They do try hard though, so let's give them some credit for that. Expect less and you'll probably get more out of it. These guys are not the ""jam"" band they're sometimes advertised as."
3,"Great Value, Bad Format",The cd is great. Dvd is a bit grainy but still good. the only problem is the audio cd is recorded in dolby digital. I bought the cd in to play in my car but my player will not play it. I have an eclipse 5445 which is a decent cd player but it will not play cd's in dolby so... i was dissapointed in that. they should have recorded the audio cd's in regualar stereo.
4,Pretty Darned Good,I think this is an good album for live. Well done and energetic. I'd recommend it.
3,Good to OK,"I finally went and saw the band O.A.R. the other day at San Diego State University. I had been hearing about this band all year from my friends, but have only heard a handful of songs off the good old iPod. As a fan of jam bands I was impressed by O.A.R.s stage presence and posititive attitude. They were a little weak instrumentally, but overall I had a great time! Anyways this review is about the album 34th & 8th. After seeing the band live I let this album pop my O.A.R. CD collection cherry. After listening to it a bunch something sounds like it is missing. There are not many exciting songs and I swear the singer is going to ruin his vocal folds. I enjoy the album every now and then, but will not add it to my top albums to play. I think the playlist is lacking and I wish the lead guitarist (not the singer) would be less timid, both live and on the album. If you want an awesome Jam band, try Umphrey's McGee or the fathers of it all, The Grateful Dead."
5,Friendly Village Colander,An attractive & useful addition to my Friendly Village Collection. I already have the enamel teakettles on my stove. I'm using the colander as a fruit bowl as it looks so nice on th counter.
4,golf instruction,Detailed & good. Nick Faldo is noted for his in-depth understanding of the golf swing & how to play the game.
3,Fair to OK,"Faldo is/was a great golfer. Open champion. Hit the ball beautifully. Stood over 6 feet tall. Big, Strong. Had a good ghost author. I got the impression while reading this book that Faldo is/was a natural player. That he played so very well, but didn't really know how or why. In other words, a natural, by feel, athlete. I am not. I like more detail. I was disappointed. Faldo's book is an interesting first read, but it is not a reference I will return to."
2,"Not really a best of, more like a remix of",When you think about the best of Nas you think of at least a few tracks from every album not half the tracks from Illmatic and Nastradamus. What makes things worse is that almost every other track is remixed. I thought that in the best of Nas they would at least have tracks like Silent murders or Memory lane but whoever put this trash together was thinking of something different. New York state of mind and I gave you power isn't even on this and they call it a best of. It's embarrassing that they put best of on the front of this CD. You don't need this cause if you're a true nas fan you already have the best of Nas.
2,Where is it from?,"I was very excited to order this ring holder for my daughter's wedding shower. I knew it would be special given that the web site said it was made in Ireland, and we are of Irish descent. I thought it would make a nice family heirloom. When it arrived, however, it was marked ""Made in Slovenia"". I feel duped."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A compilation of DC's One Million event. This is something that is really only average, with probably the interesting part being what will two Batmen get up to, particularly when one is from so far in the future.As part of a celebration, the current Justice League get invited to the future by the future League, but who is really manipulating what."
1,Bleah!,"One can only hope that Mr. ""Channeling Chekov"" was being sarcastic; this is an incoherent mess that should never have been collected in its present form."
1,"Poor design, arrived broken. ATD fails.","I oped for this washer instead of the plastic Harbor Freight model, which was the same price. Both are Chinese-made, which is impossible to avoid with tools like this.The metal tub / tank is nice, feels ""shop-grade."" One star for a nice paint job. However, the fitting which holds the nozzle to the pump is plastic; mine arrive broken despite adequate packaging. This fitting is the one thing that should be metal, it could easily be stressed as you move the nozzle around. I laughed when I realized the company name was ""Advanced Tool Design.""I ended up with the Harbor Freight model which feels like it will fall apart after a little use (typical for that brand) . But it works."
3,Marking time,"""The Resistance"" lives up to the others in this series in terms of Rusch's world building and characterization, which remain consistently strong. However, this book gives the impression of being more of an interlude in the action, while characters move from Point A to Point B, than a vital part of the development of the story. It seems to simply be a set-up for the next book in the series. I've read many fantasy series, and I've rarely had the sensation that the author is just marking time until the next novel, but I get it here."
4,There's no resisting this book!,"Finally! The 4th installment to the story of the Fey is in! I have loved this series from the very begining. This book is less action intensive as some of the others but it was necessary, you can see the beginings of a wrap-up. The royal family of the Blue Isle are finally united. Rusch does this artfully with more than a few surprises. Oh I can't wait for the 5th book.Can I tell you a secret? I want the Fey to win."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Rugad the Black King has been successful in his attack on the Blue Isle, but to ensure his total domination he still has to deal with his hybrid great grandchildren, Gift, and Arianna.Arianna in particular, it seems, may harken back to some of her female ancestors in strength, and will likely be a big problem."
4,"a very good book, but fell just short of the others.","I have been faithful to these books since i read the first one. I loved it. the only reason i did NOT give this book five stars was because after reading the other books this one seemed sort of like the weak link in the chain, but it still is a good read."
4,The clean-up,"This book cleans up the series by tying together all of the loose ends that were hanging. Some more of the mysteries are solved, and more powers discovered. I am at a loss though as to why the animosity within the Royal family. It seems like the two children, particularly Gift, being raised by the Fey, could have known of his sibling's existance... Oh well, I guess that is why I am the reader, and not the author."
2,Much as I LOATHE Cameron Crowe...,"...what he ""quoted"" the late great rock-journalist Lester Bangs as saying ref the Doors: ""The Doors? Gimme a break! Morrison was a drunken buffoon!"" is, sadly, correct. Manzerek, Krieger, & Densmore were all consumate musicians, but Jim Morrison...well...""flew too near the sun,"" I guess...(I know, ""mixing metaphors"" there, citing Procol Harum when ""discussing"" Jim Morrison) Try to locate ""Alive She Cried,"" and that's probably all you'll need...although I STILL have to say that Oliver Stone casting Vile Kilmer in that stupid Doors movie was about the most idiotic ""casting"" dear tawdry, tacky ol' Hollywood's had done, until it ""cast"" Tom ""Phildelphia"" Hanks as the ""tuff guy"" in the equally repugnant ""DaVinci Code."" Say it again: your money, buy the ticket, take the ride...if you must continue to dredge up a ""performer"" who's been gone since WAY before America lost its integrity."
3,Far from The Doors at their best,"Live In Boston is easily the weakest live Doors album yet. Jim is drunk and his performance seriously suffers. I was able to tolerate (and even enjoy) most of it, but I would not be surprised if someone shut this off after a few songs. Sadly, Jim only gets worse as the show goes on. A lack of pro-recorded shows and the ability to market this as ""Jim Morrison at his wildest!"" are the only reasons why this show is being released.If you have all the previous live Doors releases and don't mind hearing a very rough performance, go ahead and check this one out. I've enjoyed listening to it, but I'm sure it wont become a favorite. There is much better live Doors material out there.If you don't own any Doors live albums yet, start with Live in Philadelphia or Live in Detroit. Both of those shows are vastly superior to Live in Boston."
4,Roadhouse Booze,"""Live in Boston 1970"" is the rough-edged ""warts and all"" Doors release we've all been waiting for. Jim Morrison feels no pain during these unpredictable Boston Arena concerts - propelled by the brilliant playing of Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and John Densmore. The results are occasionally sloppy, yet often compelling musically. Jimbo really lets loose with his stream-of-consciousness rapping and engaging blues covers. When considering his inebriated state, it's amazing that Morrison performed two shows in a single night. Historic document, indeed."
3,"Not for the uninitiated, but not nearly as bad as some of these reviews say","I was kind of wary of this one because of all of the feedback on Morrison being so wasted that his performance suffers, but those comments are exaggerated. He does slur a bit from time to time, but it's doesn't deter from the songs. Far from it, a lot of the songs are uniquely rowdy and energetic. Of the three discs presented here, only the third is dispensible.If you have enjoyed prior Bright Midnight Archives releases, I think you'll like this. Really beautiful packaging and liner notes as well. If you are new to The Doors live material, I'd suggest picking upIn Concert, Live in Boston is for the fan who wants to hear everything."
1,worst concert I ever heard.,"I went to the second show that night. The show started late on account of a fire next door. Morrison was so drunk,and incoherent,that the cops shut the show down. That's my one and only experience with The DOORS. Still loved them though. There has never been,nor will there be a performer like James Douglas Morrison. God bless theLizard King!"
1,Really Awful,"I was excited when I saw this CD set was coming out. I bought The Doors In Concert several years ago, so I was hoping this was more of the same. When I listened to this new release, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Jim Morrison is so obliterated through most of it that he mumbles lyrics and is totally out of key. I guess the surviving members of the band must be hard up for money to put something like this out there. Frankly, they'd have to pay me to keep a copy. Don't waste your money."
5,My favorite LIVE album by THE DOORS....,"of all the LIVE albums by the doors, this one is my favorite....great songs, Jim sounds awesome, Fun to listen to!!!!! doors fans, you MUST have this one...."
2,JIMBO PHONES IN THESE PERFORMANCES,"WHILE THE DOORS PLAYED WELL DURING THESE PERFORMANCESI'M AFRAID THE LEAD SINGER RUINED AN OTHERWISE ENJOYABLEAFFAIR.THE DOORS ARE PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL-TIME,BUT I WISH I HAD NEVER PURCHASED THESE CDS.I AM ASHAMED THAT THE DOORS CHOSE TO CAPITALIZE ONSUCH SUB-PAR PERFORMANCES BY THEIR LEAD VOCALIST. EVENRAY MANZAREK BEGAN SINGING AT CERTAIN POINTS TO TRY ANDBOLSTER MORRISON'S LACKLUSTER VOCALS.NOT THAT IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE, BUT THE THIRD DISC ISLESS THAN 30 MINUTES LONG, WITH ONLY 2 SONGS (WITH A DISMALAUGMENTED LIGHT MY FIRE) PROPER SHOWING UP. I WOULD HAVEGIVEN THIS ONE STAR IF NOT FOR THE STELLAR MUSIC. UNFORTUNATELYJIM RUINED THAT WITH HIS SLOTH-LIKE VOCAL PERFORMANCES."
5,An Essential Reference Tool,"After I read this as a book borrowed from the library, I knew it was a book I had to own because of its value as a reference book. Although the clothing featured in the photographs is basically outdated fashion, the countless line sketches illustrate basic principles of design that are true for style which surpasses fluctuating fashion trends. In essence, if you know your figure strengths and problems, this book will help to educate your eye to recognize the clothing to flatter your assets and remedy/conceal the problems. It is brilliant! There is no padding-- defined as excessive wordiness and photographs--in this book."
5,The very best.,"I first used this book as part of a class on wardrobe at my local college. This is also the true story of the author's journey to understand image in today's world. It is the very best guide I have seen for buying the right clothes for your body, and chock full of hints on maximizing your assets and minimizing your body faults. Highly recommended."
5,EVERYONE should read this book,"If you are not sure or just do not have a clue as to how to dress yourself, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!! Do not let the cover fool you, I know it is outdated, but the information inside is not. IT will help a ton in buying the right clothes for your body, but also for your personality and show you how to put things together so you look polished. I know that image consultants have this book, all their principles mimic everything that is written in here. A must have for everyone!!"
4,Excellent overview,"For someone who has difficulty finding clothes that fit, as well as those who sew and want to be sure the styles they select will be flattering, this book is an excellent place to start. Also provides recommendations for different effects, based on very minor changes in line, neckline, etc, which illustrate the sort of adjustments one can make to save a wardrobe without having to start completely over."
5,Best Set To Date,Just finished viewing this NEW offering of some great shows from the 1950's early 60's and the best set I have seen to date for the money. Rick sings in some and the quality is good to excellent. Just a great set with some shows featuring the original integrated commercials...good buy.
3,Ozzie and Harriet Classics,"I found the overall quality (audio and video) to be good with the exception of a couple episodes where the sound and video quality were not that good. On a few of the episodes, the video is very dark. But overall, it's a nice collection of the 'early' years of Ozzie and Harriet Show. Young Ricky Nelson was comical in his role as a typical 13 year old or so with the quick comebacks and answers. I'm glad to have this dvd, especially now that none of the Harriets are with us anymore with David Nelson's recent passing."
5,Ozzie & Harriet Classics,The thing I like about this compilation is the fact that most of the commercials have been left in. They are as much a walk down memory lane as the show itself. After viewing this 4-DVD set I got the 12-DVD set put out by the same people. (Mill Creek) It has 100 episodes. So I'll be watching a lot of Ozzie & Harriet...and old commercials in the near future. This is a GREAT compilation.The Essential Ozzie & Harriet CollectionOzzie & Harriet Classics (4pc)
1,Trust me on this one.,"Extremely painful to watch. This is an old French film (dubbed) that was made on a very, very low budget. The quality is as low as I have ever seen and the story is sooooo bad you just can't sit through it. Special Effects are so bad my 12 year old could do better. Do not waste your money here. In fact send me a prepaid return envelope and I will gladly give you mine."
2,A little disappointing,"While the presentation of the product is nice and the price is affordable, the razor does not produce a comfortable shave, and the brush does not compare with badger hair brushes. The one highlight of the set is the shaving soap, which does smell pleasant and work effectively."
3,whats the hold up?,Ok well i ordered this part 2 weeks ago and it has yet to ship since this is the only place i could find that would ship my part overseas i had to order from this company.. not to thrilled on the fact that it has yet to even be put in a box.

This book is essential in today's world where women are constantly striving to achieve a sense of balance without making sacrifices within their careers."
1,This book stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book contains very little information of value for the golfer looking for great golf. There are much better books with more useful information.
1,Tiny Butter Dish,"Purchased this for Christmas and the first thing I noticed was how tiny it was. A stick of butter barely fits inside the cover!! Butter gets all over the sides of the cover because it just isn't well proportioned for a regular stick of butter.I also noticed the color is not even or consistent - I purchased cinnabar and it really didin't have an even coverage of that color. Perhaps the other colors fare better?Overall, I was very disappointed in this purchase, especially as I thought it was a bit overpriced."
2,Butter dish,"Butter dishes seem like a mundane thing until you start searching for one. I reject out of hand all those with no handle because I know from experience that without a handle the lid is difficult to remove. This one seemed like it would fit the bill, but the problem with it is that it was designed poorly. The dome of the lid is not tall enough. A standard cube of butter cannot fit inside without being smashed slightly and you end up with butter on the inside of the lid. This one will do for now, but my search continues for the perfect butter dish."
2,Pretty - but small,"Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly."
3,Smaller than Butter!!,"This is a nice butter dish. Unfortunatly, it is shorter than a standard stick of butter (land o lakes). When you put the cover on a stick of butter, it actually sits about a 1/4"" off the bottom, so the butter is never covered."
2,Butter dish not tall enough,It looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it.
2,Where's the Room,"Looked like an old butter dish my grandma used to own so I sucked it up. Was disappointed when it arrived. Will not hold a stick of butter. I buy the COSTCO brand butter and once it is placed on the dish, the lid will not close as the cube hits the inside top of the lid. Could probably set two cubes end to end but it is not tall enough inside."
5,great product,The butter dish fits our needs perfectly ! The lid fits quite well in the groove and the little knob makes it easy to use--with less chance of dropping the lid. The red adds a little spark of color on our dark kitchen countertop.
4,fiesta covered butter dish,worked well with the rest of my Fiesta dinnerware. This was a hard-to-find piece.
2,Fake?,"Butter dish is okay but it does not feel like the real deal. It is lighter weight than my other Fiestaware and does not seem as well made. As others have mentioned, it is a little small and always getting messy as a result. Logo on the bottom not the same as my other Fiestaware. Suspect it is counterfeit."
3,RB,"I do like this butter dish. The knob on top is very useful as I have arthritic hands. However, it is too narrow and not deep enough for the normal size of butter. The only butter I could find to fit is Yeo Valley organic butter and then you have to cut it in half lengthways, which is fine for me."
4,skinny butter,"I love Fiestaware and was super excited to get the butter dish! It looks just like the picture, however it kind of smooshes the top of the butter when you put the lid down. Maybe it was designed for thinner butter? I still love the look of it! ..but be warned, if you don't want butter on the inside of the cover either cut it down or buy skinny butter."
2,Not great,"I ordered this is plum from amazon. They shipped the 2 pieces wrapped together, nothing seperating them. Obviously a mistake on their part. The dish arrived chipped on the top part because of the way it was wrapped. Amazon sent out another right away. At my request the new one was wrapped seperatly. When it arrived the bottom had major glazing flaws, white spots in 2 places. However, I have no doubt I was sent a used one when I paid for a new one. Probably one previously owned by another reviewer who said they sent theirs back. It smelled funny and has water spots and lots of dirt. I decided to keep it since who knows what may be wrong with another one if I tried to get a replacement. It is too small for the butter I buy. I read some reviews where people say its too small, some say its perfect. It depends on the butter you get. I will need to buy different butter or just use it without the lid. I love my fiestaware but this piece was a disapointment."
1,butter dish,Very disappointed with this item. You cannot see in the pictures of it that it has a lighter trim and I wanted an all black item. This looks cheap
4,butter fits nicely and handle on top is perfect,"i think this butter dish is great! i read some reviews about butter not fitting in it so i was a little nervous, but one of the long slender sticks of butter fits fine. a short fat stick of butter might not fit. the handle on top of the lid is perfect to pick the lid up with and its easy to carry. nice design too."
5,Sunny Bright,Everyday when I see this bright yellow butter dish sitting on the table I think of a sunny summer day with yellow snapdragons in the garden and hummingsbirds drinking dectar from the flowers.
2,it had a small chip in the bottom of the butter dish,"When I received itm, it haD A SMALL CHIP ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BUTTER DISH. i NEEDED IT RIGHT AWAY, SO I USED IT,THANK YOUMICHELLE LUSSIER"
2,not what i was expecting: too small,"it seemed like a great idea. the color looked good.upon receiving it, i noticed the color was not as bright as on the picture. not a big deal but it isn't as nice.the real reason i gave only 2 stars is because :1) the top size does not match the bottom size (the top never covers the base completely. the is always one side uncovered, or both.2) when using a 4 oz butter stick, the top does not close. the lid is too shallow to cover properly a 4 oz butter stick!!A little wider and deeper top would have been better."
2,messy!,"nice looking, yesbut so narrow that the butter gets everywherethe idea was to have a covered something to keep everything neat and tidyfail!get something bigger"
4,Looks great but doesn't fit a stick of butter,"I love the Fiestaware, it looks great and the color (green) is very stylish. However the lid of the dish is not large enough to fit the stick of butter. The butter rubs against the lid and mashes the butter slightly. Not really a big deal, just means your butter is slightly misshapen, and the lid gets buttery. There was another review about this issue that I missed. Overall, I still think it is a good looking and mostly functional butter dish, but it is interesting that it doesn't do its single function very well.I guess you could cut the butter in half before putting it in the dish."
4,Small but pretty,"This butter dish does hold a standard quarter-stick, but you must carefully put the lid back on in order to avoid smearing it. There is a red butter dish online for half the price, which I also ordered, and I like it better."
2,Gorgeous! But too shallow!,"As pretty as this looks on my counter top, it's practically worthless as it's too shallow to contain a stick of butter without getting butter all over the lid. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it. A bit pricey too."
5,Matched great,"Matched my dishes which are not Fiesta. Had trouble finding a black butter dish, because local stores did not carry this color."
3,not big enough,"I am just getting into fiestaware. I like the look, feel and weight of this product, but wish it was bigger."
5,I love The Orvis Fly Pattern Index,"I really love this book. The pictures are great. It's fun to pick out one of the flys and then try to make it. The way the book is bound allows it to lay completely flat, which is helpful. The instructor at our fly-tying class said this was the only book he took out with him. So, after looking through his for awhile, I had to have one. I got a fantastic low price on Amazon, to boot, and couldn't be more happy with it."
5,wilton multi grip clamp,very nice and easy to use clamp; used in pairs they hold you project off the bench. both ends are ajustable for quick setup and use.my only complaint is they are now hard to find.
2,Not what they said,"I bought this modem because they said it would work with Windows 98. I just use the internet to check mail and read news, which was perfect for my old computer. However, when installing it said I didn't have the right version of Windows 98, even though I had previously put all updates from Microsoft on my machine. The error message said I needed to download the updates from the internet, but how could I do that, if I couldn't connect to the internet. My old modem broke. I used my account elsewhere to make the purchase.I had to update my machine.Won't buy from them again."
4,Buy from 'PartsforyourPC',It's a dial up modem. It works like it should. PartsforyourPC gave me a great price and has awesome customer service! Thanks Jeff!
2,Princess Birthday party,I got theses cookies for my daughters Princess Birthday party.They are very cute but they taste very bad the girls took one bite and left them.
3,sad,"I was very disappointed in this recording as it sounds, in parts, like a boot-legged recording. As the ear becomes accustomed to the sound, it improves, but I would not recommend this version."
5,Tegan and Sara always good,"I love this new album. This is definitely more pop than their other albums, but it does not disappoint. The production on this album is amazing. Please check it out!"
3,Frustrating sketches never form an entire album,"I just can't get into this album. The songs float through the listener - blink and the record is over. It's frustrating, then, that so many of the songs feel half-formed and bland. The stand-outs are ""Hop a Plane,"" ""The Con,"" and ""Like O, Like H"". The rest is nothing remarkable - uniquely Tegan and Sara, but nothing I can savor. Pieces throughout the record never form a cohesive whole."
4,best record,"I think this is tegan and sara best cd they have put out . Tracks like nineteen , call it off and back in your head to name a few are just great songs you can relate too."
3,Not quite as advertised,"While both the picture and description describe the shank as working with the quick release mandrel, the shank is NOT included with the saw. I purchased both this one, from Amazon, and the 2 1/8, which was sold by Geroy's. I returned this thinking the shank was suppose to be included and just missing. The second 3 7/8 also arrived without a shank, along with the 2 1/8, also without a shank."
2,Did not meet my needs,"The idea behind this dog door is great, but the execution is lacking. First, the measurement says it will fit a dog with a shoulder height of 14"" - my dog is 12"" at the shoulder, and there is no way she would fit through. While the entire piece is large enough, the actual flap opening is rather small and she wouldn't even go near it. Also, the electromagnetic ""tag"" that is supposed to go on the collar is ridiculous. First of all, it's very bulky and rather heavy, which I don't think would be very comfortable for a small dog or large cat. Secondly, the loops in which to string the collar through are too small for any collar with a buckle. I would have had to buy another collar with a very slim profile and more of a belt like buckle. Overall, I had to buy a regular dog door to replace this one. Generally though, installation was rather straight forward and I did like that they provided various screws to use dependent on your door thickness."
3,Difficulty in Installing the Dog Mate,I did have problems with the installation of this item when I installed it through the wall of the house to allow my dog easy access to the outdoors.
3,"Works, but not for both dogs.","I bought this based on reviews from this site and others. We have two dachshunds. It works fine for the smaller one, but the larger one can't get in position because the magnet hangs too close to his chest and his nose is a bit too long. If his legs were two inches longer and his nose three inches shorter... well you get the idea. Not such a great door for dachshunds. I did manage to get it to work with a large and expensive rare earth magnet but thought that might be bad for the dog so the tabs are taped so it will always swing open both ways."
2,Connecting the pictures,"Once I realized that the stories connect interesting but random photographs, I could not get away from the feeling that the book was not ""real"" stories. Instead it felt as if it were an assignment. I could not finish the last story."
4,Welsh in form,"If you like Welsh's previous novels and are happy with more of the same then you'll enjoy Glue. The characters, narrative, and story have all been done by Welsh previously. That said, the character portrayals are magnificent. The book is funny, touching, and brutal throughout.Nobody portrays the underclass in a more genuine way than Welsh.I would like to see Welsh expand his horizons. He is a great talent but is limiting himself.To those previous reviewers who were outraged about the animal cruelty. There was a very definite point to it, showing what some of the characters were capable of (Doyle and Gentleman). The lives of some of the characters is not pretty or politically correct. The world is like this. Closing your eyes is not going to make it go away. If you don't like it I suggest you stick to Winnie the Pooh."
4,You'll want to shower,"I always feel filthy after reading Welsh, and I frequently check my nails for grime while turning the pages, but its a good kind of filth, like layers of pleasant hangovers or fragments of memories from substance-induced benders so you put off showering until the throb in your head subsides. Welsh's growing strength as an author is the interaction and bonds of relationship between his characters. This is what makes Glue and Trainspotting enjoyable romps: you get sucked in to the mayhem and mania of his characters decadence. You also get sucked into the relationships and find yourself siding with one character, wincing at another, or ashamed at another just as if the characters are taken from your life and not fictional. The relational capacity of the narrative propels the novel and sets it above earlier works like Filth and Maribou. Finally, Welsh's use of time bridges nostalgia for the past while providing hope for a future."
5,"Glue, Scottish youths' trips to manhood","Glue is a well written story of four scottish youths and how they grow up and change in the environment of Edinburgh's slums. It is quite direct in descriptions of what they do and how they do it. The major obsticle to easy enjoyment of this is the use of heavy Scottish dialect. However, the reader will find these youths do not have a 1000 word vocabulary and after a difficult beginning the reading gets quite easy."
2,Weslh Imitating Welsh,"I hope this isn't true, but if ""Glue"" is any indication of the current state of Irvine Welsh's creative juices, than he is in a state of disrepair, or worse, decline. The novel is Welsh imitating Welsh. He tries to convey the best aspects of his earlier work - the slaggin' Scot slang of the urban poor best found in Trainspotting, provocative scenes best found in T-Spotting or Maribou Stork Nightmares or Acid House - but it comes across as trying rather than being, a fatal flaw for any writer, let alone one as previously charismatic as Welsh. It's tired writing, without any real edge, cliche-ridden to the point where Welsh brings back characters from the T-Spotting. Sad to say, these are the only interesting scenes in the novel. Stop recycling, Irvine, it's bad for your health and mine."
3,Good but inferior to early works,"When I first read Trainspotting I was blown away. The language, incomprehensible initially, soon slipped into a pattern that I could understand allied to a cracking story. I duly read all of Welsh's prior and following work and picked up Glue on its release here in the UK.I found Glue to be heavy going yet still persisted to the end. Welsh's mix of Scots dialect and plain English does not allow for speedy reading and at times I felt like giving it up. Yet Welsh always seems to produce at least one character that you have to follow to the end. In this case the man in question was Juice Terry (fa they Juice lorries, ken?). Hilariously over the top - repulsive to know but great to read about.Sadly, Terry's attractions are diluted by some of the rest of the book. The cameos from the other books seem forced and unnecessary. The other characters raised no emotion in me.Pick this book up for Terry, just don't expect another trainspotting."
3,Pretty Mundane,"Welsh has finally dropped the ball. After putting out a seemingly endless string of amazing material, ""Glue"" is a fairly major disappointment. Basically a near-500 page character study, Welsh seems to have lost the plot, or at least forgotten to include one here.The characters are fairly interesting, and there is plenty of memorable dialogue, but unless you're someone who is fascinated by endless descriptions of attempts at getting a shag, binge boozing, or silly football fights, you'll probably be disappointed with this one. It's all a bit too mundane.If you're looking to get into Welsh, you would be better served with any of his other work (Trainspotting, Marabou Stork, Filth). Long time fans may be disappointed as well..at least, this one was."
1,What happenned?,"I was a big fan of Welsh in his previous novels. I truly thought him as the talent many claimed him to be. I didn't enjoy Filth much, but this Glue needs some cohesiveness. It's as if the author figured if he called the novel glue it would miraculously happen in the content of the book. This is my third attempt to read this book. I again gave up. This feels more like an anthropological text then a novel. I get a lot of background, the hows and whys these people do the things they do. But he doesn't give me a reason to be interested in this world. I hope he goes back to his old self in his next novel."
4,All Welsh is good,"This is a very good read, especially for Irvine Welsh fans. Story line is well constructed. There are maybe some excess fillings but they all contribute to make the novel richer and the characters more lively."
1,Animal Cruelty Unacceptable,"I've read all of Welsh's previous works, and loved or at least strongly liked all of them, but Glue is crossing the line for me. The detailed animal cruelty did not add to the story, and after reading the part about the boy ""shagging"" all the girls, I feel that his objectification of women in combination with animal cruelty to be more than I could swallow. I stopped reading the book. It was too disgusting. I think Welsh has crossed the line of good taste, and is now aimlessly shocking readers."
4,GONI REVIEW,"I recently bought the 2 goni set with the 12"" and 8"" goniometers. Although the 12"" is very handy for big joint measurements and femural/tibial torsion I wish they made it out of the same elastic material as the 8"" goni(which I LOVE)The 12"" goni snapped so easy just in my backpack between my books.Just a little bend and....snap. I think a 12""flexible goni will do the trick. It is easily moldable with the body parts you need to measure."
5,i love it,cheap but does its job. the smaller one is a bit soft but the big one is well worth it for the price
4,Goniometer Set,"Thanks so much for the fast shipment however, it was received it a ripped box and the goniomenters were bend. I am still able to use them therefore it's ok."
3,Gonimeter set,"The goniometer is wonderful-But on careful inspection-it was missing the 8"" goniometer. It was suppose to be a set and one was missing. I sent an email from my confirmation email and have not heard anything back. Please advise who should be contacted.Thanks you,Ida Smith"
1,never got it,"never got this item. after contacting the seller, i was sent information for delievery confirmation, but it never made it to my house, so i am assuming it was a USPS issue?"
3,Layout needs reorganization,"Update: I am tired of the layout. This book makes you flip back and forth a lot. For example, a paragraph on page 63 will refer to a diagram on page 68. Why can't they put the diagram on the same page as the paragraph? Or some question will refer to the some specific page of another chapter? A simple reminder printed on the side of the page will save a lot of time. I have never flipped back and forth so often like this and I have been in college for more than 10 years. Maybe the British like to save paper and Americans prefer convenience.I major in biology and pharmacy. I am reading this book plainly as a hobby. The author has painstakingly made this book as easy as possible. There is a few places I have to do some algebra but that's about it. Hopefully I will finish this book soon. Then I will get into calculus and advanced calculus, vector, tensor and review my linear algebra. I want to be able to appreciate relativity in its original glory."
3,Too much for amateur scientist,"I'm fascinated by gravity. What causes it, how it behaves, how does it relate to quantum mechanics. But for someone other than an advanced (graduate) student, it's too much. The descriptions are all in math, no verbage particularly, except to tell what the math is about.If you're a graduate student, this is probably an excellent text. But not for the above-average amateur (but well read and knowledgeable) scientist."
5,Superb,"Excellent roleplaying guide for any Old Testament story. Covers play as any of the ancient peoples of the Bible and during any period, although there is an emphasis on Israelites and King David. Detailed events system makes village and farming life interesting. Bronze age army combat resolution captures the feel of the ancient ballads. Heroes dominate the ancient battlefield like champions from the Trojan War. Very, very well done and worthwhile for anyone interested in roleplaying the Ancient World."
2,Not enough,"This video includes only 40 actual minutes of 'exercise' and therefore is NOT a 55 minute workout as claimed. Too much time is wasted on stretching and not enough on toning and strengthening. She hardly gives you any time to switch from one position to another and get adjusted, and she only does 3 - 6 repetitions of most exercises, and only one set. It doesn't feel complete to me. (I'm a 28 year old female)"
1,Absolutely Ridiculous,"Despite the title, the ball actually gets in the way of a good strech! I had to put the ball aside for some of the moves. Moreover, I almost fell asleep during this workout. It's not challenging nor interesting. DON""T BUY IT! And please, if there is a good balance ball workout out there, let me know. This is not one of them."
3,"Not a true ""workout"" but good tips for stretching routine","I bought the ""Deluxe"" DVD version of this video at Target. I concur with the sentiment of the other reviewer: the moves illustrated in the body of the video are practiced way too rapidly to be of benefit as-is. And because some of the positions have you reclined on the balance ball, it is difficult to see the correct posture without craning your neck. More importantly, you have to tune out the narrator's instructions concerning breathing; due to the rapid pace of the moves, you'd end up hyperventilating if you followed her voice to the letter.This video might constitute a workout for those out of shape but for those in reasonably fit condition, it won't qualify as more than helpful tips for new ways to stretch. But as a morning stretch routine, and if the moves are practiced a little slower than is on the video, it's an invigorating way to start your day."
4,Nice looking but small,The dish is very nice but a little small. Probably worth getting the larger version of this.
4,Works well but a little bit *too* tall,"This is a well-functioning, high quality baby gate. You can rest assured that your little one isn't going to escape. However, at 39"" high, it's tall enough to hit a door knob, preventing a door from shutting if installed in a threshold. 36"" would be plenty tall -- in fact, other manufacturer's label their baby gates as ""extra tall"" at that height. We didn't realize this would be an issue until we decided to replace the door to our baby's room with a new door with a standard knob hole. Otherwise, this gate is great. Just make sure you measure and that you don't plan on replacing the door with one with the knob hole at a different height level."
4,"Strong, but Narrow gate","Overall, this is a good product. It's strong, not flimsy at all. However, the gate is very narrow so, if you use it, put it somewhere where you do not have to carry anything through it like a car seat or stroller. The gate combined with the height make that extremely difficult. Also, make sure the walls you will put it against are exactly even. We bought it for the downstairs, but will move it upstairs."
5,Kittymom,"This is the greatest thing and to think I waited this long to finally find and buy one. It keeps our five cats from getting into a part of our house that is off limits. It's high enough where they don't want to jump over it.Would recommend for children or pets.Well made, and easy to assemble.Delivered promptly and in A+ shape along with a video on assembly and extra parts."
4,Works well for kids and dogs,"It was super easy to install--we didn't even need the plastic brackets that came with it, as the tension was more than sturdy to keep it in place. I love the swinging feature since it can swing both ways. However, I just wish it had a feature to prop it open when not needed (naptime for my son for instance). We may purchase another so we can have one at each side of our kitchen to keep my very adventurous 22 month old out of harm's way. I'm also glad we got the extra tall as he likely would have figured the mechanism out if he could see it at the lower level."
4,Dreambaby Swing Close Gate,"This gate can be a little tricky to install if you have uneven walls like I do. It makes it difficult to find the exact position on the wall and correct amount of pressure to apply on each mount. Also, I suggest to use the wall brackets or it will peel paint, and it will take a week or two for the gate to settle and then you need to adjust it again. However, once you have found a good position and adjustment the gate works very well. I love the fact that my nephew cannot figure out how to open it and I love that it swings shut behind me so he can't follow when I am carrying something."
3,Not great for Cats,I purchased this gate after reading several reviews on different sites. Several people mentioned that this gate worked well for their cats. I assume that those cats are old and fat or young and small. My cats are two years old and they jumped right over this gate soon after I installed it. I gave a rating of three stars because the gate is of good quality and may be able to serve other purposes... not necessarily for cats.
2,Not safe,"The base is a tripping hazard - both I and my wife have tripped over it.The way it is mounted to the wall is unstable - the plastic cups that bolt to the wall are too shallow to prevent the gate from dislodging from them (especially on the top - see below).The friction system using the adjusting screws is solid enough on the bottom of the gate where, thanks to the (extra tall) base, the screws push against an uninterrupted piece of metal(the base). On the other hand the top is a lot looser, especially on the side where the extension is not used, causing the tall thin set of rods to flex and dislodge from the cup. If you try to tighten it, the gate is impossible to close. On top of it my 2 year old son managed to loosen the adjusting screws on both sides of the gate causing it to open even without the safety latch."
4,Great gate!,This gate was simple to install. It is very sturdy. My puppy has been able to hop several gates and knocked down those he couldn't jump. This gate holds him in well and is easy to unlatch for me. I am using this gate for dogs so I think the ease of the latch may not be great for toddlers. It is a great buy. If only I had bought this one before the five others. I also bought the Carlson 0941PW Extra-Tall Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door for the entrance to the cat room. It is also strong enough to keep the puppy out and has the benefit of a cat door. I recommend both.
3,Doesn't work with my cat,"I bought this gate to keep my cat out of my bedroom. There are plenty of reviews that said it works with other people's cats. It did work for the first few months, but then my 9 lb cat found out he could jump up, touch/land on the top of the gate and hop over. He seemed surprised when he did it the first time and now that he knows he can, there's no turning back. My cat was a stray before I got him, so it's possible he picked up some tricks and learned some creative jumping when he lived outside.Now I've loosened the knobs on the gate and I keep it up when I'm outside the bedroom (the cat doesn't want in unless I'm there) and I remove the gate from the doorway and shut the door when I want to keep him out.Overall, I think the gate will work for most people and maybe even for people with heavy cats that can't jump that high. For my purposes, the gate is ok."
3,"generally like it, but....","I bought the security gate to prevent our Italian Greyhound from entering parts of the house in which we don't want him, and for that it's just fine. My only comlaint is that there is no way to leave the gate open without it swinging shut. Even a small bungee type device would be a good addition (and I'll probably figure out something on my own)."
1,Disapointed,"I had high hopes for this baby gate. With 5 children, I've tried more than I can remember. After my experiencew with this gate,I've realized that no presurized gate can stand up to the constant opening that happens in a busy family.This gate worked fine for the first few weeks, but within a month the rubber grips on the pressure mounts began pealing off. Once they were gone the gate slipped all over the door frame no matter how much pressure was on it. It also scratched up our woodwork. Lesson learned. I will use the wall mounts in the future.Another complaint is that there were no replacements parts readily available, and within a month I had to spend $33 to order them from the only place I could find online. The manufacturer is in Australia, and I could not find any contact info on the website to ask for replacement parts."
5,Relentless toddler proof!,I have a very tricky 18month old who likes to stack things outside gates to make an escape - this gate has thwarted his attempts! It's a GREAT height where he can't try to open it. Total peace of mind! Really solid construction and super easy to install (although I didn't use the wall discs - those are a pain). Highly recommend!!
5,Perfect for what we needed.,"We have been looking for a gate to keep the cats out of our bedrooms while being able to keep the doors open throughout the day. The height is perfect and the bars are close enough they can't get through. We have 32"" doors and this fit perfect. Great product! The product is built extremely well. We will most likely order another two of these."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent product. It feels very sturdy, a lot like a professional iron gate. It doesn't seem to rattle and the auto close feature is very nice. Make sure you look at the measurement ranges to be sure it will fit your needs, but if it fits, I highly recommend it. This is the first five star review I have given."
5,Love this gate!!,Not only does this work great it looks great as well. It's nice looking and tall so my son (1 years old) won't be able to reach the lock on the gate or climb over. A lot of other gates are very low and would really defeat the purpose of keeping my son out of the Kitchen. Because in a few months he would be able to climb over the low gates.Overall A+ in my book.
4,Great Gate,Great Gate but a little hard to open. I must left up on the gate while releasing the latch inorder to open it. It looks great and closes by itself every time.
5,Nice gate!,Easy to mount and very sturdy. The gate opens easily and closes securely. I use it to contain 4 large dogs it is very effective.
1,DAMAGED!!,"I bought this gate because of all the great reviews on it. I was very disappointed as soon as I took it out of the box. The whole gate was damaged and bent. It was bent so bad that the gate would not close and left a 3 inch gap between side and the gate. I would of returned it but I didn't want to deal with the hassle and the $20+ to reship it. So my husband did his best to bend it back into the correct shape. So as of now, the gate seems sturdy but we have to be careful opening and closing the gate due to it being warped. I think this gate would of been awesome if we wouldn't have received one that was damaged!"
3,Careful if Installing in a Doorway and You Want to Close the Doorway Door,"This is a well built product. However, the description and installed picture of the product (vendor website) would appear to be misleading.The picture shows the gate installed in a doorway (the door is clearly visible). It would imply that the gate would be properly clearanced for a standard height door knob.Again, this appears to not be the case. If you need to install this gate in a doorway and still have the ability to close the doorway door, verifying the same with the vendor or manufacturer might be a good idea."
3,"Okay gate, but a pain to install.","We bought this taller gate to use in our childrens' room at night, as they were escaping and getting into things in the middle of the night while we slept (think, broken eggs on the floor). We got the gate and it was bent all funny (although the box said it is supposed to be bent) and it was a pain to install. Installation was HORRIBLE.Once it is installed, though, it works fine. We occasionally have to tighten the rods on the side, but for the most part it works well."
5,Best gate ever,Super easy and quick to install.. Soooo strong! Our dogsJump it and it stays strong! Looks great and actually has a little style to it!
4,STURDY!! SHARP LOOKING!!! NO DIRECTIONS NEEDED!!!,GREAT BUY....NICE PRODUCT...THROW OUT THE DIRECTIONS AND DO BY COMMON SENSE FROM THE START!!!! tOOK 10 MINS.BUILT STRONG AND LOOKS LIKE I SPENT TONS OF MONEY ON IT!!!!
5,works well,"I placed two of these gates in standard doorways to keep my Greyhounds and Danes from bringing to much traffic/dirt in several carpeted areas of the house. Tall and strong gates. One of the Greyhounds (""Quinn"") is very persistent and will scratch at the gate. The gates have held up will to his persistence. These seemed to be the tallest gates I could find, as well as included the extension pieces (if needed).My wife (110#'s and in her late 50's), had a bit of a problem opening them. Some minor adjustments and piece of tape seems to have resolved this issue. Another draw back is lack of one feature, which I had wanted. Other gates have a feature of being able to stay open, if pushed all the way open. This would be nice during routine daily tasks. Simple solution is to place something in the way of the gate, which is a minor inconvenience."
4,great but dont expect to use the screw in's in length is 27-27.75 inches,This product is great BUT I was expecting to be able to use the screw in mounts and not have to use the adhesive ones.You CAN NOT use the screw in mounts if your opening is between 27-27.75 inches (you can if its larger) But it seems to be doing the job.I have a 20 month old 3foot 4 inch son (daddys a monster :) ) and hes very strong he can't push it off even without using the screw ins.
5,I LOVE this gate!,"I bought this gate because my toddler is an escape artist. It's extra tall, and he can't climb over it. He also can't get a good foothold on the slats, which is great. It' was really easy to set up, we didn't have to use the screws/cups to mount the gate, so there was no need to put holes in the door frame. My son rams into this gate with his pedal cars and ride on toys, and the gate has yet to move. It's easy to get open, even with your arms full. I LOVE the fact that it automatically swings closed behind me. I will be purchasing a few more of these for around the house."
2,ChilliDad,"I have had this up for only a half a day and I am about to replace it.The base stands 2 plus inches on the ground which is a clear tripping hazard, and for the lock to work properly, the fence needs to be adjusted exactly - and even then I dont trust it to stay like that. It took me awhile to play with the extensions before I manage to even get it close to the locking position and I am in construction.It is also very loud when it shuts, and may wake or disturb a sleeping baby"
4,"good gate, but sizing wasn't correct","the website said it went through 42 but the way the extensions work, it goes to 39 and then jumps to like 47 - we had a 41 inch opening so it didn't work for us and we had to return it."
3,"Looks great, but its deffective","Just opened the package to set this up, and the top latch its even close to being together. It will latch from the bottom and not from the top. What a hassle this thing is going to be to return, its heavy and large, and I am very upset that its defective."
5,black gate,"I am a daycare provider and needed a gate that was sturdy enough for all the kids i care for. Love the taller height b/c they cant climb over it. Very sturdy gate, kids cant knock it down, love that you only have to drill a small hole in the wall. Easy ti install. Love this and will buy another."
5,Pet Gate,"So this gate is suggested to be used as a baby gate, but works amazingly for cats. Everyone kept telling me not to waste my money on a gate because my cat would only jump over it....so untrue. This gate is perfect for keeping my cat in a certain part of my house when I'm at work. I didn't even have to use the screw attachments to bolt it into the wall. It is so sturdy and doesn't knock over. The only thing that I would change about it is how easily it shuts itself closed. For moms it would be helpful but when I'm home it gets annoying sometimes. But definately worth every penny you pay."
4,Great tall gate for dog,Good and sturdy! It is high enough that our dog does not jump over! Easy to install too!
1,Cliched story with really horrid CGI,"Dragons of Fire and Ice is your typical story on about two warring kingdoms who eventually come together for a better cause. One represents the Dragons of Fire and the other Dragons of Ice. Eventually an evil wizard forces them to join forces to save both kingdoms.I could have forgiven the cliched story and lame voiceacting if the animation was average to good. But it's not. In fact the CGI is poor by even early 90's standpoint. This would have looked bad 10 - 12 years ago. Some say that kids will see through that and like this. I disagree, animation has come a long way since we were kids and with 95% of shows and movies featuring outstanding to really good animation (both cell and CGI) I believe the target audience (once again tweens) will look at this and walk away, or watch it once and walk away. This is not recomended, a lot more effort should have been put into this. Completely unforgivable."
3,Is there a way to excise the inappropriate slide guitar?,"An excellent collection of boleros and other Cuban favorites is marred by the absolutely inappropriate guitar playing of Ry Cooder. He has performed a great service by introducing North America to these fine musicians, but unfortunately could not put aside his own ego or lack of musicianship."
3,Such a shame Ry Cooder felt he had to,"Stunning vocals by Ibrahim mingled with aweful, fumbling guitar by Ry Cooder. What was Ray thinking, especially on track 2? I agree with some of the other reviews on the ""hawaiian"" feel to Ry's playing... Thankfully, his input isn't apparent on all tracks, although this album is not as polished as the original buena vista. I'm dying to bring this CD with me on my next visit to Cuba and ask the local Cubans what they think. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that it isn't too difficult to find musicians of equal caliber playing all around Cuba, pretty much any night of the week. If you love the music and are from any other country than America, go there for the ultimate musical experience."
3,my least favorite of all the BVSC discs,"I don't want to take away from Ferrer's artistry by critizing this album, but the song selection is so ballad heavy that I find it ponderous. What I like best about all the other Cuban records is the drive and the energy. This disc was just too slow paced for me, song after song. I admit to my personal bias, so if you like ballads, by all means buy it. After hearing Ferrer's incredible version on the Putamayo CD of ""El compositor se equivoco,"" I was incredibly let down by this CD. Cooder was getting on my nerves as well on this recording."
4,An excellent album from one of Buena Vistas best.,"Ibrahim Ferrer's excellent voice comes out on this album. The mood is exception with ""Silencio"", the duet with Omara Portuondo. ""Aquellas Ojos verdes"" and Bruca Manuigua are also classics on the album with Ry Cooders authenthic touch. ""Cienfuegos Tiene su Guaguanco"" was a different and welcomed upbeat turn. Why four stars and not five? The song selection could have been a little better considering Ferrers talents. Songs like ""Marieta"" and ""Nuestra Ultima Cita"" could have been recorded better or even left off. Overall, the album was an excellent attempt on Ry Cooders part in getting Ibrahim Ferrer heard on his solo album, even though his Buena Vista contributions were significant."
3,Why Ry?,"Would someone please, please, please, please, tell me why, why, why must Ry Cooder insist on including his intrusive electric-slide guitar on what would otherwise be a great record? All props to Ry for bringing this stuff to the fore, but like any casual drinker, you have to know when to say when."
4,This one has grown on me.,"The ""poor"" production is what makes this recording enjoyable!I feel like I'm walking the streets of Havana!Ibrahim Ferrer has a very raw style of interpreting these gems!""marieta"" and ""que bueno baila usted"" are my faves.To have glossed over this,would have been a betrayal to the live sound captured within."
2,Very poorly mastered,"I am Cuban, and I know cuban music well. Ibrahim is not at his best in this CD. The musicians sound terrible. My high school band sounded better than this. The track ""Aquellos Ojos Verdes"" (a very old tune) leaves you with a belly ache. Especially when you remember how it used to sound when played by the bands of old.There are a couple of redeeming tracks, though. Those that were originally part of the ""Buena Vista Social Club"" tour and didn't fit into that CD. One of these is ""Cienfuegos Tiene su Guaguanco."" Or ""Que Bueno Baila Usted"" where the tune is ""borrowed"" from the great Beny Moré.Oh, yeah almost forgot. You'll hear a lot more of Ry Cooder's Hawaiian tunes (which I consider almost an insult to cuban music) in this one."
5,Astounding.,It's difficult to accurately describe the tremendous musical accomplishment the BVSC and Ibrahim Ferrer achieve on this album. Mr. Ferrer's voice coupled with the smooth yet precise playing of the BVSC combine to create a record that is timeless in its harmony and diversity. An instant classic.
3,Over-arranged and under-rehearsed,"This is an enjoyable album, though the quality is not as consistent as in ""Buena Vista Social Club"". The songs are over-arranged; too many layers of unnecessary string and background vocals. Wish they'd kept it simple and straightforward, as they so brilliantly did in the BVSC album. Also, the recording seems under-rehearsed; lots of out-of-tune sounds and the band is REALLY lax with its tempi."
5,The Best of the Lot,"This was the first one I listened to (of the BVSC series or the indivduals that comprised the group) and it probably is the best of the lot. This is very good music. You actually get the sense that they are making the music for the pleasure they get from it. They aren't looking for some kind of hit, just music they have enjoyed, in the hope that you too will get some pleasure from it.My personal favourites? It's a toss up between ""Bruca Manigua"" and ""Guanteque Campesino"". Awesome ... you know when it is so good you tear up just a little bit ...?"
3,It's Ballad Time-sigh,"I tend to agree with Michele Hernandez's review of this CD. There are just too many ballads. The boleros had me on the verge of nighty night. A let down from BVSC, primarily for it's lack of diversity. If there were more songs like ""Marieta"" or ""Que Bueno Baila Usted"" I think the CD would have been better. Maybe it's a personal style bias but valid nonetheless because too many ballads will have you on the verge of unconciouness! Some of the ballads are superb, like ""Como Fue"" but there just aren't enough of them, there are just too many syrupy love songs. I played this without hearing it first at a MLS soccer game tailgate party and was quickly asked if I had anything else. If you want to turn the lights down low and go for that intimate moment put this on, but you'd better be with someone exciting as you might fall asleep otherwise. Don't get me wrong I like boleros but in small quantities, at the right time."
4,More good songs than your average collection offers,"Gee, I rather liked Guarache Campesino (although I haven't heard it in its pure form) and I flipped for Chan Chan (on the other album). I love Ry & think he deserves a lot of credit -- for making this music accessible to a broader audience and for bringing these Elder Statesmen of Cuban music to the stage again."
1,Disappointing once again!,"For the record! Here is the breakdown of the royalties. Ray Cooder 50%; the Cuban goverment (the agent) 45%; the non-Cuban technical staff 5%; the performers 0%. Ray Cooder is only exploiting the Cuban performers for his own profit. This is common knowledge in Hollywood. There is no doubt a lot of feelings coming out of the performers, but that is all. They were never part of the top Cuban performers group in the Pre-Castro era. The quality and technics are poor; the duets are never in sinc. I have better recordings in my private Cuban collection. Try the just released ""Cuba es musica"", a 4 CD collection from Venezuela and Colombia. Ray Cooder's hawaiian sounding guitar does not belong in traditional Cuban music!"
4,Nice Latin Music,"I never heard of this group before mainly because I do not listen to Cuban music, but they were plying this CD when I was in the bookstore last night, I liked what I heard so I bought it. Very nice. I like it."
4,"Great man and music, poor production","Fans of the Buena Vista Social Club movie will enjoy this CD because the recording of these songs that was the structure of the movie (they recorded the BVSC CD two years earlier). Ferrer is an enjoyable song stylist. His version of ""Que Bueno Baila Usted"" is every bit as lively as Beny More's original and stands out as one of few upbeat numbers on the CD. I am sad that they did not show the recording of that song in the movie because the studio was probably hoppin'. Ferrer went from shining shoes and trash removal to international superstar in two years and at 73 years old. That's enough right there to buy the CD.The sound quality of the CD is poor. That's surprising since even Cuban CDs recorded at EGREM, the state run studio usually are of very solid quality. On some songs, you hear a hiss that is reminiscent of the Dolby B days of tape recorders. That's a shame."
5,Calphalon Saucepan,"This is a great saucepan and has been a great addition to my cookware. The quality is great, it seems to evenly dispurse heat and it is nice to be able to ""peek"" in without having to remove the lid. I would recommend this product."
1,Hat too big!,Don't waste your money! Cheaply made and its too big! Didn't like it at all and falls off!! Don't buy!
1,An error that should not have been made,"One word, ""Crayfish"". Yes this is a real word, but I have never heard anyone in New Orleans or the state of Louisiana use it. For all the research she is claiming to have done, and for working in New Orleans, it seems she would know the locals use the word ""Crawfish"". This one little error says a lot about her research and what she knows about New Orleans. Another author romanticizing a city and era they know nothing about."
1,Disappointing,"This book is was not written in an enjoyable format. Martha Ward jumped from person to person and date to date and back and forth and all around. She also injected her views on people and places without presenting proof of validity. They were simply her views, but the way she wrote them in, they could appear to be factual."
1,star wars galactic heroes drapes,Dont be fooled by this item its just a blue curtain with the starwars logo on it. On the listing it shows you other images and shows the starwars figures on the fabric that matches the comforter and sheets ect but there no where to be found on the curtain! This item is exrememly misleading and my boys were very disapointed with there BLUE curtains!!!! I honestly dont undersyatnd how people like this stay in business!
2,"Disappointed, misleaing","VERY disappointed! The curtains took 6 months to arrive, then instead of getting the Galatic Heroes curtains with the Star Wars images, what I received was blue curtains with the Star Wars logo screen printed instead.The picture did show curtains WITH the images!!! That is what I wanted but not what I received."
2,ESTAFA,"A los verdaderos fan de HDS NO se los recomiendo, en el dvd obiaron el concierto del Palacio de los Deportes de 1993, lo cual salio en la caja edicion especial de flor de loto, solamente esta el concierto de La Riviera de 1995, no se porque EMI LATIN estafa a la gente de latinoamerica, nos creen pen&*^@$, cuando EMI de España SI incluye ambos conciertos en el dvd."
3,No compren este..compren la version espanola,"Apoyo a carlos chavez...no gastes tu plata en este disco/dvd..la version espanola es mas completa y viene con mas canciones tanto en el dvd como en el disco.... si van a gastar en esto mejor consigan la version espanola...no se cual es el problema de la gente de emi. acerca del disco es bueno, el dvd mejor que el cd...el cd es completamente en directo y no tiene arreglos asi que el audio no es 100 porciento el mejor...pero es aceptable."
2,Low quality videos that are mostly not even cardio!,"I got this set for free - thankfully since the quality on these DVDs is generally so bad I can't imagine paying for it. Grainy film quality, blurry instructors, and in Martial Fusion the instructore actually manages to go off the green screen and have parts of his body dissappear.The Martial Fusion and Step are the only true cardio workouts here, and they are moderate workouts at best. This appears to have been cobbled together in a sad attempt to make more money without putting in much effort. Skip it, there are much better workout DVDs out there."
4,Easy reading for a dry subject.,I love reading about Southerners during the Civil War and their lifestyles and this book filled a void. I was afraid it would be really hard to read and very clinical but Ms. Massey made the subject entertaining as well as enlightening. She has a great style for a history and social studies writer.
1,Is it really supposed to work?,"We ordered this because we remembered our older kids loving it and wanted our yougest son to have it. Well, we never got it to work on our computer. Maybe it just doesn't work with updated software (Windows Vista), but it was frustrating."
2,Very disappointing,"As someone who does pregnancy and birth photography, I was so excited about getting this book...and so disappointed when I actually looked at it. There are only 45 pictures total in this book...and most of them are mothers in other cultures holding their infants. This would be fine if it was a book on cultures and infants...but it's not very good when it's in a book that you expect birth photography. The reason I gave this a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating is because there ARE a couple of nice breastfeeding photographs...however, even most of the infant pictures are disturbing and not nice to look at (photos of babies left alone in cribs in an empty room while they cry alone, or otherwise not being nurtured and loved). I did not like what I saw, and felt cheated that I'd spent $12 to see it."
3,"Yes, Not 'No Soap' On This","The product itself is excellent-lots of gentle soap embedded. I did not realize before I bought it, how much rinsing and drying would be involved. Better description would help understanding. It is useful only at a sink or in the tub, which really did not suit my purposes."
4,fun live show,"Roughly 45 minutes of music on this live CD. A nice version of ""Street Corner Serenade"" by the great Wet Willie, and a fun version of ""Trudy"" by the hosts of the Volunteer Jam, the Charlie Daniels Band. Dobie Gray surprises with an impassioned version of ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" and Delbert McClinton shakes things up with a very cool version of ""Standing on Shakey Ground."" Less successful are the contributions by Ted Nugent and Rufus Thomas, and even Willie Nelson doing ""Good Hearted Woman"" is just so-so. But there is also an enjoyable cover of ""Higher and Higher"" from Jimmy Hall of Wet Willie, and the underrated Leroux (or ""Louisiana's Leroux"") do their hit ""New Orleans Ladies."" All in all, a good slice of live musical history. It would be nice, however, to have all of the ""Volunteer Jam"" albums on one set instead of seeking out these separate editions."
3,I Actually Prefer The Second Season,"I know the WOTW fanatics are going to go nuts over this review because I'm going against the grain but I always though the first season was too campy and silly and derived way too much from the 1953 movie.The second season with it's dark, paranoid, chaotic, Blade Runner-esque atmosphere fit the concept of an alien invasion much better. The dim lighting(from filming at a more northernly latitude in Vancouver) was a precursor to the dim lighting in the early seasons of The X-Files and currently on FRINGE. It gave it more of a ""spooky"" and serious tone.Hopefully Paramount will release the 2nd Season on DVD."
2,Good series let down by bad transfer,"Although not a great series, it has it's moments, especially where episodes directly tie into the 1953 film. The show contains some genuine creepy moments and is entertaining in a quaint 80's fashion. However, what really lets this box set down is the picture quality. The picture is washy and looks like a 2nd generation video copy rather than a DVD transfer. I don't know weather this is due to the way the series was originally filmed (on videotape maybe?)or whether no effort or expense was put into creating the discs (after all the price is very cheap for a 6 disc set)."
3,War of the Worlds The Complete 1st Season,"This show was presented as a continuation of the original Martian invasion, which occurred decades earlier.When watching this show, you must definitely keep in mind the time period in which it was created. Modern CGI and special effects, makes this show look like a ""B"" movie.I gave this program a 3 Star rating, because it has lost its appeal since being viewed through the eyes of a young teen. Unlike Star Trek (TOS), this is not a show that transcends time."
1,A disappointment at best...,"Okay let me start with the fact the I purchased ""war of the worlds the entire series"" from rare TV. It was expensive. When I got it, no cases thus no artwork. Video quality poor. I saw this and assumes they had brought up the video quality. Wrong-o!The only improvement they made was the cases, keep case, and the menus. No captioning (I am a little hard of hearing) audio is the same as the set I have. This is not amazon's fault it is the producer. I think Paramount should get it together.That all I have to say."
3,Poor Picture Quality,"I only so far have watched the first ten minutes of ""The Ressurection"" and had to stop!It's as bad if not worse than my old copy on VHS tape.Playback BTW on a Denon DVD1920 with HDMI connection to a 42"" Panasonic Plasma in 1080i mode.Back to my T.J. Hooker DVD boxset that yield a pretty good picture with the same setup."
1,Okay....,"I find it strange that every good review on here, claims that the first season is better than the second. I would have to disagree. The first season is crammed with poor acting, terrible plotting and dialogue that would make you scream. In comparison, the second series killed off the worst offenders and shifted the action to an urban wasteland, bringing a completely different focus to the alien menace.I found it was a far better plot device to remove the military support from the main cast and cut them loose to fight the aliens alone in a nearly ruined urban nightmare.If this were the second series, I would buy it. The first season does nothing for me."
3,Good just to have it... but come on.,"This show hasn't held up well but it did have a lot going for it, as the aliens were actually brutal and therefore more threatening unlike Star Trek where it is all talk. There are some episodes where it is obvious they didn't have a lot of money, but they still got along. I liked season two better, but this one was still fun to watch again.For the real deal though, go Galactica."
4,"Ahhhh, 80's nostalgia","This series came out when I was 11 years old. I loved it then, and I love the DVDs now. The quality is not the best, but I am able to overlook it. Extras would have been nice with this DVD, but extras are hard to come by with older series, unfortunately.I recommend these DVDs to viewers who have seen the show when it was on TV, or new fans who want a taste of what Sci-Fi was like back in the day."
3,Still not bad,"I remember first watching this series as a kid when it first aired in 1988; 20 years later, the 1st season is still pretty entertaining to watch despite some bad acting and dialogue (though still far superior to the awful 2nd season). Having just sat through the episode with the alien baby (""Unto Us a Child is Born""), it still amazes me that the explicit gore from that one episode made it past the censors for regular TV airing back in the '80s."
5,Excellent Sci-Fi,"I waztched this every week when I was a kid until season two came along and changed everything. However, with the price of this season being so reasonable, and a few more years under my belt I am prepared to give season two another chance. I hope it is released on DVD too."
3,Great show - mediocre DVD,"The first season of War of the Worlds was really very good for a low budget sci-fi TV show from the late 1980s. Good stories, likeable characters, and a quirky sense of humor make this a fondly remembered favorite. The second season, however, should be avoided at all costs.Sadly, the the picture quality of this DVD release is quite poor. There's considerable color bleeding and artifacting noticeable, especially in darker scenes. It's quite distracting. The image is often too soft and it's extremely difficult to make out detail. Audio sometimes appears very slightly out of sync. And why, oh, why did Paramount see fit to cut out the little sequence at the start of each episode where the alien hand encompasses the Earth? Clearly, very little care was given to this release by the studio.I highly recommend this show to any sci-fi fans, but the DVD release was a bit disappointing."
5,This made my night,"YEAH!!! I've been waiting for this to come out for a LONG, LONG time. These characters were the most appealing of any sci-fi series since the original Star Trek. I saw it at 12 and literally chose my career because of Norton Drake. ""Eye for an Eye"" is an absolute classic. (I quit watching near the start of the second series; the very color of the show went morbid, it was like some post-apocalyptic quasi-religious BS. But considering what's on TV these days, I might just give it another chance if it comes out!)"
4,Great series. Not so great DVD transfer.,"One of the very worst video transfers to DVD I've ever seen. Murky and muddy at best. This series deserved far better. Shame on you, Paramount. I'll be leary of any future releases from your studio."
1,Do not buy this DVD people,Screen quality is VHS or less. There is no reason to by this DVD other than nostalgia.
2,I can't believe I used to watch this,"I was happy when this came out, because I used to watch this every saturday night while I was waiting for my wife to get home from work. Man! Just goes to show, beer does make you dumber. The acting was horrible, the dialog was horrible, the production values were horrible. Wow, how could I have mis-remembered something so thorougly? 2 stars for the nostalgia aspect only. If you don't have some similar reason to buy this, save your dough."
1,I wish I had listened to the bad reviews,"They were right on the money. I've watched the first 3 episodes and this was a horrible waste of money. This has to be one of the worst sci-fi shows I've seen. Now I realise why I had never heard of it before this dvd release. Everything about it is terrible. Especially the acting. The 4 stars have been some of the worst actors in the business. Hopefully they didn't find much work after this as they are an embarassment to everyone in the profession. Aside from the that the writing is terrible and totally unimaginative, and the direction is incredibly lame. There are no special effects to speak of, except those left over from the 1953 film, just a few gooey make-up effects. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,Good Premise. Bad Execution.,"The basic premise and the story ideas for this low-rent series aren't bad. In fact, they're rather intriguing.What does this show in, however, is some terrible acting and even worse dialogue...particularly the lines spoken by the Martians.All-in--all, the series reminds me of one of those bad cliff-hanger serials that we used to watch on Saturday afternoons."

2,Something Missing,I think my mind must have been going through an eclipse when I purchased this movie. There is hardly any substance to the story. The eclipse phenomenon isn't very realistic either.
4,A truly unusual little film...,"I've remembered certain moments from this film from seeing it on TV as a child, and swore that I'd track it down someday and watch it again, see how it holds up.It's an odd one, primarily memorable (to me) as a film that doesn't show you the monster at the center of its story until nearly the end. The first Alien followed a similar approach, to great effect.Well, that part is true, but the new pleasures for me as an adult were its quirkiness, its attempts to serve as a psychological drama more than a horror film, and its subtle indictment of the privileges of aristocracy. Very glad I tracked it down."
2,No.,"Atmospheric. Execellent style and staging (borders upon Val Lewton country), but not enough substance to satisfy. Silly script with an even sillier solution to the mystery. If you've seen The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 -- the one with Basil Rathbone) and The Wolf Man (1941), then you've already seen this done better, although those earlier efforts didn't have as much attention to detail on setting up a misty sense of doom. (The misty doom was later used by director John Brahm with a beter script in The Lodger.) It's sort of like seeing an early template for Hammer horror. 20th C. print on DVD is awesome, and it's nicely packaged with good language/subtitle options. I'd recommend it as a curiosity piece for fans of pre-1950's era horror."
2,New Style,"If you are a Bad Boy Bill fan, you can instantly notice the change in style. Its not as ""housy"" as his last CDs. It has started growing on me, but I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,BAD CD,I was disappointed with this cd.It didn't have the beat to keep you hopping like his previous cds.The best by far is Bangin theBox Vol. #3. That cd is really bangin!
2,WORST CD,This cd was a disappointment.It didn't have the beat that keeps you hopping.The very best thus far is Bangin the Box Vol#3. Thatis a bangin cd!
3,Wonderful Jump-starter,"Beautiful lesson in prayer. Bible verses and prompts gave me material for daily prayer. The real ""win"" however comes in the commitment to writing my prayer needs and then tracking God's hand in those matters. This book helped me to record and truly see the tangible effects of supernatural things."
5,This set is from another world.,"This Calphalon set is another concept to cook. Probably you'll think it's a joke, but believe me, food tastes different when you cook on this cookware. And one important point is that for this price offered through Amazon, never in the life you will have another opportunity to acquire such quality of cookware."
2,Calphailure,"The set looks so great as a hanging piece, however, is about useless as a funtional piece. The pots are greedy and hold everything; no really, non-stick is not even relevent here! The clean up is insane, I have to use a special cleanser to maintain the copper and then if not used frequently I have to re-polish the set.I have more modern Calphalon that are wonderful however this set was impractical."
2,If You Live in Britain,"While the author did present good sound background and structure to understanding the angel financing market, I wish I had known beforehand that much of the information was based on experiences in Britain, not the U.S. I would not have purchased this book -- especially at its price. Many of the tables and references were in pounds, not dollars, and entities British, which required translation. I just couldn't relate beyond the basics. Sorry. Not my cup of tea!F.Lee"
1,Probably Good If...,This book was on the syllabus for my senior seminar class. We never used it. It is currently sitting in a storage bin. It's probably a good resource if your professor will actually have you use it.
5,GREAT Cd,"...I am VERY impressed, when I first saw this CD I looked at the cover and thought. ""Oh God, this looks a bit cheezy"" With a CD cover with all these LA Bimbos, fake breasts, and vapid expressions on their faces. But let me tell you, this is one of the best progresive house CD's I have EVER heard in my life. It clicked from the very first track and just kept going, not one bad track here. Darker, harder (not too hard), progressive, creative with seamless mixing and no cheezy vocals to ruin the vibe. DON'T LET THE COVER FOOL YOU! GET IT!"
1,Shipped a USED product,"Seeing as these are car brake pads, I was severely dismayed upon opening the package that the product had been opened before and there were possible signs of it being used. These are BRAKES. I expect them to be NEW if I'm going to be installing them on my car. I am extremely disappointed and will be asking for a refund."
3,Tapestry of How Buffett Thinks About People,"If you own Berkshire Hathaway, it is worthwhile to buy this book. After reading it, you will be incredibly impressed by the all star managers (business boy scouts) Buffett has working for him. And you will never have to worry again about what happens after Buffett (may this not happen during my lifetime).By piecing together the various aspects of the individuals, you'll begin to understand the type of people Buffett finds ""honest and competent."" One of the harder aspects of investing is evaluating management--this is an insight into how Buffett thinks about business people.For the investor, the section on Lou Simpson (since so little is written) might be worth the price of admission.However, there are many investment books I'd read before this one."
5,Great workout for toning,"Great workout for toning... The compilation video is a great start. Once you are more advanced, I recommend purchasing the three separate videos from the Balance Ball series that concentrate on abs, lower body, and upper body. A great buy!"
3,too small,"I followed the weight and height guidelines and purchased the small kit, however, when I inflated the ball and began the program and followed the DVD guidelines, I found the ball was too small. If you are over 5'0 tall, I would bypass the small and order the medium."
4,REALLY for beginners,"Though Abs section is reasonable for intermediate level, all other parts are very easy. If you never tried balance ball and never did much of fitness, than it's for you. Also too much relaxation for me. May be worth to do sometimes."
4,Easy and useful,"I have found this book to be useful and user friendly. It covers not only the typical grammar and punctuation questions, but information on document design and formats. It also includes model documents for letters, memos, and others. One table of contents lists subjects alphabetically and one lists them topically. Everything in the book is listed alphabetically: Bias-free Language comes right before Bibliographies. The beginning page of each entry includes a light blue box with the rules listed. Then each ""rule"" is expanded in a clear way with examples. I have found the answer to almost every question I've had. And they have been so much easier to find than looking up each mention of a topic from the index as you have to do with some style manuals."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"These songs are all re-makes of the originals. If what you want is the originals, please purchase other Jimmy Dean CD's, as this one is not the one that plays the original hits, only re-makes by Jimmy Dean later in his career."
1,Remakes - NOT ORIGINAL recordings,"If you're looking for the sound of the original recordings, look to a different CD."
2,Review of 20 Great Story Songs,"This CD has some great songs on it. Unfortunately, they are not the origional recordings. If you're ordering for the song selection, this would be a good choice. If you want to get the origional recordings, you may be better served ordering Jimmy Dean's greatest hits."
3,20 Great Story Songs,Find the cd one to recall some of J Dean's older stuff. The song I was looking for was on it. Thanks
5,Bard's Tale... Great Game!!,"My son and I fight over who's going to get to play the game first... it's a lot of fun. But keep in mind, this game isn't an easy win... your character gets killed a LOT at first... but it gets easier as you go along, and once you figure out your strategy it's a breeze. You play magical tunes to call forth creatures to help you thru tough spots, and once you get about 1/2 way thru, the creatures you call can really make a difference on the outcome of the game. Play the right tunes to call forth the right players, and winning is a BREEZE!!! And search EVERYWHERE... you can find some great weapon upgrades and lucky tokens to make winning even easier. Now that I'm 1/2 way thru, my character hardly ever dies."
5,Buy this classic,Its 2012 and i still play this game. Awesome story best voice acting in a game ever and it will plain out make you laugh over and over. Im a true gamer and play everything from sports to fps to rpgs so i know quality. Buy this game and give it a chance you wont be disappointed.
4,I am in this movie!,"My three kids, my wife, and I were all ""extras"" in this movie. It was filmed mainly at the Stuhr Museum in Grand Island, Nebraska. Annie Pavelka (the real Antonia) lived about 40 miles south of Grand Island. Although this is not one of the classic films of all time, it is one of my favorites because of our experiences.I believe this adaptation is fairly close to Cather's classic. I had my doubts when I heard ""Doogie Howser"" would be one of the stars, but he really did a pretty nice job. Jason Robards was very good in the film, as was Eva Marie Saint.""My Antonia"" is one of my favorite novels as Cather paints a wonderful picture of Nebraska in the late 1800's. This film does a nice job of carrying forward that portrayal.My guess is that this film will become a staple of high school Academic Decathlon teams across the nation as ""My Antonia"" is the novel for study in the Language and Literature portion of the testing."
1,Too much pop,"In their latest attempt at rock, Biohazard once again puts too much of an attempt for a pop-like sound and spirituality than just plain rocking...songs like these just don't make the cut."
4,this isn't a biohazard reveiw but.......,If you think these guys are a rap/hardcore/metal crossover act you would probably be a lot more impressed with E-Town Concrete.They do that better than anyone even if they are trying to sell out.Anyway suppport Biohazard they may be big and all that but they've paid their dues and never forgot where they came from. peace
1,This CD was terrible!,"I really tried to listen to this stuff, but I can't get past the 3rd song without almost falling asleep.I think its called salvation or something. Anyways I ended up using this for a one way ocean frisbee.If you want to waste your money you've come to the right place."
3,ok for a broad list,"This book does have a rather thorough list of companies and organizations in the DC metro area. But, I also must concur with the above review to some extent. Most of the listing don't have any descriptions and *really* need them. And, the groupings are of limited help, for ex. Airbus and the International Food Policy Research Instit. are both listed under ""International"". Its best just for flipping through and hoping to get some names and urls for places that you might have overlooked."
1,Better off using a phonebook,"I was very disppointed with this book. I have a hard time imagining this would be of use to anyone. There is scant information and the few listings they have are poorly orgainized. For example: interior design, graphic design, architecture and civil engineering firms are all gathered together under the heading 'Design & Enginnering'. The listings are then arranged alphabetically and no description of the firm is offered. Unless the company conveniently has 'architecture' in its name, you'll have no idea if you're sending a cover letter to an architecture firm or a graphic design studio. These disciplines are far too different to be lumped together! I found more listings in my field (and with more information) by opening up the yellow pages."
4,A great work...with one flaw,"I'm afraid I'm not enough of a, um, ""music critic"" to see all the complex problems with this work as described so prolixly by some other reviewers. So let me just say I loved it. Beautiful, fascinating music, beautifully recorded and enthusiastically performed.The flaw? At one of the most quiet and tense moments in the work, some retard in the audience lets out a huge cough. I mean a ""drown out the orchestra""-type cough. A minute before or after and it would have been merely annoying. This one shatters the mood and I hope the guy was quietly strangled behind the symphony hall later by Rattle and Maw. I can't help but wonder if there would have been a way for the audio engineer to digitally remove the damn thing some way after the recording.Anyway, if you have a reasonably open mind to modern composers, this is a must-buy. Just be prepared for the Cough of Doom."
3,Nicholas Maw and Odyssey,"Nicholas Maw is an interesting composer but not as interesting as the conductor, Simon Rattle, believes in his foreword to the recording. The music of Odyssey is disappointingly dilute; a lot of it is opened up and developed too slowly to generate much fire, only Part III, admittedly the longest, really focussing on what it intends to do. It is as if the composer, like Havergal Brian I'm afraid in his Gothic Symphony, believed that length is its own justification. Maw's The Ruin, for solo horn and chorus, is far more focussed. Nevertheless Odyssey is worth having as its composer's testament and magnum opus."
5,Perfect for beginners,"This book have the basics of neural networks (NN) treated at undergraduate level adequated to students of physics, mathematics or engineering. The relevant concepts are all explained and it recquires no previous knowledge in the area from the reader. It is a perfect introduction to the theory of neural networks for those who are iniciating in the field and have no experience with NN."
4,"In the film business, this record is what's known as a ""merchandising tie-in"".","This is the soundtrack to thedocumentaryabout Robert Crumb. The album features ragtime piano instrumentals played by David Boeddinghaus and ragtime guitar instrumentals played by Craig Ventresco. In addition, there are two scratchy old recordings by obscure blues singer Geechie Wiley. The music here is quite enjoyable, probably even more so if you are interested in music from the beggining of the 20th century. Here is the track listing:1. Ragtime Nightingale2. Sensation Rag3. Harlem Strut4. Abraham Jefferson Washington Lee5. Belle of the Philippines6. Last Kind Word Blues7. Radiator Cap Blues8. Gabby Glide Medley9. Frog-I-More Rag10. Cocaine11. Won't You Fondle Me Medley12. Pass the Jug13. Skinny Leg Blues14. Buffalo Rag15. 35th Street Blues16. Mabel's Dream17. Wall Street Rag18. Hateful Blues19. A Real Slow Drag20. Comic Montage Stomp21. Someday Sweetheart22. Rag Pickings23. Black Diamond Rag24. Ragtime Nightingale"
4,Awesome,"This cd is too good for words. Except the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there first cd was 20 times better than this (if possible) so all hardcore shootyz groove fans need to pick up this import, its well worth the money, and maybe more.Peace"
3,too soft,this cd could have been better. it is too soft compared to j.i.v.e. Some songs are good but they have softened down there flow.
3,Let Down,"This CD has so much potential it makes you rip your hair out when they get to the choruses. On mad for it, the beginning is excellent, but the chorus is horrible. i turned it off after the first part. L-Train is the only song with a good chorus on the entire cd. NYC minute rules...until u hit the chorus. It makes me so mad to hear excellent music like this all of a sudden go sour with the crappiest choruses i have ever heard. They remind of 80's soft rock choruses. Can't say i was real impresses with this cd. L-Train is an excellent song though."
2,DONT BELIVE THE HYPE!,"all i can say is that this CD has the absolute WORST choruses in the world. Their song mad for it is tight, but the chorus is one of the worst i have ever heard. I can't believe that people could rate this 5 stars. L-Train is an awesome song, but thats it. Forget about this cd."
2,Don't listen to the hype!,"I read all the reviews below saying ""if you like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, you'll like this."" Forget that! These guys can't rap like them, they don't got good beats like them, and they they'll never be as famous as them because of it. Buy this cd only if you like Shootyz Groove. If you like rap meets rock music go somewhere else."
1,Needs improvement before you can use it,"I have Grady White 20"" boat and used this sock to slow down drift in 2' waves and 7-10 mph wind. This sock was broken during first hour of use. 2 belts fell off. Almost 1 foot of stitching came apart. Material is Ok, but quality of assembly is awful. I'm not a specialist in stitches and showed it my wife for inspection. She told me that we have to redo all stitches with backing material before it can be used. The original stitching is not designed to hold any load even in light winds. Re-stitching will cost 30-50 bucks."
5,Gorilla Amp,"Great little practice amps,plenty of volume and easy to service if you have problems,such as the 1 fuse that I have had to replace once.This is my 3rd Gorilla and what can I say I love em."
5,Very fine live performance.,A lovely performance. The opening movement played at a stately tempo which indulges the solo lines. A fantastic piece. I practiced with this CD and a supermute to prepare for reading it with friends next weekend.
3,caged fury,hi this was a good movie on tape when i bought the dvd set caged fury had lines in the movie my tape plays better then the dvd if any one has a dvd of caged fury with out any lines for sale please put it up for sale very poor copy of the movie thanks frank
3,Subtitles missing,"Rang De Basanti is a very excellent film! I originally rented it from Netflix and was so blown away I had to purchase it. I am from the USA, but am a big fan of films from India. I have watched many and bought quite a few. I say this so that it is clear that I am not a first time purchaser. I purchased an ""all region"" version with English subtitles. Although I am used to innacurate translations, I must say that I am very disappointed with this particular DVD. They dubbed in Hindi (I think) OVER some of the English parts and there weren't any subtitles for these parts of the movie. Other parts of the movie just didn't have ANY subtitles, and I don't mean a line here or there but large sections. As I said, I LOVE this movie, but English speakers beware. I don't remember if there were any Region 1's available, but if so, buy those!"
4,Classical vintage fun,"Crocus lives on a farm with Mr. and Mrs. Sweetpeas and all the other farm animals and he rules the land with his sharp teeth. When he gets a toothache and has to have ALL of his teeth removed he is, to say the least, despondent. When Mr. Sweetpeas realizes that the other farm animals are losing respect for Crocus, he has the dentist make four long rows of special sharp teeth and Crocus visits the dentist to have them put in. When he returns to the farm, he has gained back the respect and trust of all of his friends and once again becomes the ""lord of the farm""! Another wonderful Duvoisin story that stands the test of time, Crocus is a colorfully illustrated and basically wonderful story for all of us who have something that makes us special."
4,It's a shame it's out of print...,"Robert Roland Stanford Tuck, or R.R.S. Tuck. Along with Douglas Bader and Adolph ""Sailor"" Malan, one of the top three flying commanders at the RAF between 1940-1941.He was shot down and taken prisoner in January, 1942, when his score was already 27 German planes shot down. Maybe he would have become England's top ace...Some reviewers below said that TUck was not very famous. Yes, that is true, mostly because the RAF made an absolute effort to avoid any ""ace race"" between their pilots. The status ""ace"" was not even recognized by official doccuments.I also agree with a reviewer below that states that the book could have some information about Tuck's future after the war."
1,A TOTAL RIP-OFF,"When I bought this, at it's low price, I figured that it was a couple of years old, but not over 10 YEARS!!!!!Heck WIN 95 was the newest thing around then. There was NOTHING in the advertisement that even hinted that this was such old software. When I tried to ""enlarge"" the pic of the box, it was even a bit smaller!"
5,Rawk!,"A fine first effort, Surrenderender starts off with the hooky ""Saddest Star"" which sets the tone for this rawkus collection of tunes. Singer Franklin Morris has a voice that is both unique and familiar; the texture he provides with his wide range ""from a whisper to a scream"" keeps the listener engaged throughout the duration of the CD. ""Get Your Guns"" and ""Title Track"" round out my favorites here. Grab this CD now as it's destined to be an Indie Rock classic that will no doubt be picked up by a bigger label. Be the first on your block and spread the word..Murdocks are here to stay."
4,Murdocks Rock,"I love this album. I saw the Murdocks while they were touring for Surrenderender and they were amazing. Frank Morris' voice is unique. The band incorporates the rawness of Nirvana, the angst and appeal of Weezer, the total pureness of the Pixies. Frank Morris can scream on key, and kill you with his pain while not underestimating the intellignce of their audience.Be sure and look for the hidden track, ""June Sonata.""It's beautiful.This is their first album. I'm looking forward to their next project."
3,Daughter's boyfriend gift,He loves this spray. It is very hard to find in our area. I do not care for the smell.
5,Love,I love everything about this CD. The music is fantastic. The words are very biblical and encouraging. I can't stop listening to it.
5,Beautifully Kim book!!!,"Anyone else out there who loves the infectious Disney show Kim Possible would really dig this cool book. It basicly contains two episodes of the show, Bueno Naco and Tick-tick-tick which are two of my personal favourites, Kim fights Shego in the end of each, it's so cool.Every single page is beautifully rendered in full color and the printing is top notch. I think that the comic book style layout of the the story has a really fun feel about it and overall this book would be a charming addition to any KP fans collection."
1,discolored first time I used it!,"I bought this from Amazon, and as soon as I got it, I used it to make pasta, I did not have the heat on to high, (I never do) I drained the pasta and when I went to clean it, the bottom of the inside was discolored and splotchy! I returned it to Amazon the next day, and was refunded my money. I'll spend a bit more money and get a All-Clad pot."
3,A pleasant journey,"I'm not sure that this film would appeal to many critics more used to today's array of special effects and endless violence.For those however, who like the gentle touch of the oldies, then this film does have a little charm.A pleasant enough journey of intrigue and twists. . ."
1,Definitely *not* a filmed version of Flying to Nowhere,...a wonderfully bizarre book by John Fuller. The imagery is spectacular.
2,You'll get what you pay for.,"I was excited to get such a beautiful set of copper pans for such a low price, however, I was disappointed. They are lightweight (not much copper), and they don't conduct heat nearly as well as my more expensive copper pan. But what is even more disappointing than the food sticking (especially in the fry pans--I can't make a crepe in these without ripping it) is the horrible yellow color they are turning. While my expensive copper pan has developed a beautiful deep red patina, the Calphalon pans have ugly yellow and brown splotches all over them. I wished I would have just saved my money on the Calphalon set and bought just a couple of well-crafted copper pans instead (Mauviel, Falk, or Bourgeat). I feel like I got cheap copper pans at a cheap price."
1,??????????,"My wife and I got these as a wedding gift from my parents. We've been ""trying"" to cook on them for over a year and are yet to have something not stick. Even fresh vegetable will stick. We have a calphalon ""nonstick"" pan also and that even sticks. Even on the lowest possible setting on the range everything sticks. I'm not sure why the $20 target brand i used in college worked better than the $500 calphalon set. You're wife will try to convince you how great these will look hanging up above your range, but they are pretty much non-functional."
1,Fiction - not fact,"Timothy Dalton's bio of Jones, ""Wayward Sailor,"" proves that this wonderfully written and evocative book about life on a British warship in World War II is fiction. Dalton cites official records showing that Tristan Jones, first-person narrator of this supposed memoir, did not join the RN until 1946, when the war was over. All of Jones's books are novels, some spun virtually from whole cloth.I hate fakes. One star.If, however, you want to read an outstanding novel of the war at sea, ""Heart of Oak"" won't let you down. Its take on the period is very convincing (obviously!) and Jones clearly makes good use of the stories he must have heard from his real navy shipmates in the immediate postwar period.I love well-written novels. Five stars.But I hate fakes. One star."
1,No Good,I love Gaiam products but I have to say I pump up the ball every time I go to work out and by the end of my workout I would need to add more air. It also includes a DVD and a VHS to give you a sample of the various exercises you can do using the ball. The VHS had no sound so I used the DVD and it was very short and didn't give me a good enough tast. This package is definatly not worth the money.
2,Boring DVD,"Love the ball, hate the DVD. So boring and not challenging in the least. I was very disappointed."
5,Latin AND Greek. Wow!,"I love it.When I'm a little stuck for a Greek word, the facing page in Latin is definitely a welcome resource. I'm relearning Greek after a long time and this is just what the doctor ordered.Personally, I'd prefer less of the critical apparatus and more text on each page so as to leave room for vocabulary in the back. You'll need a separate lexicon if you don't already have one...but if you're searching for the ""Novum Testamentum"" you probably do have one.I highly recommend this!"
4,Great.,"If you liked Marks album ""Shangri-La"", you'll love this live CD. He sounds great and the versions are all a little different."
4,Good addition,"I'm losing track of all the Mark Knopfler selections I might be missing but I think there are selections here not on other albums. Most songs on this album are on other albums by him. I thought this Radio Sessions would have extended versions but this is not the case, ""Boom Like That"" for example, is actually shorter than on ""Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler."
5,Another MK winner!,"What can we say? He is an incredible musician! We have never been disappointed by him. The tag, Bards and Minstrels, says it all! We think he must have lived a previous life during the Middle Ages with the content of some of his many songs. Keep going Mark, we love you!"
4,One Take Radio Sessions Review,Some very good music herein. A couple of disappointments but overall a great CD
5,Great Holster! You have to work in in though....,"I got this for my S&W; j-frame, with a hammer. When it arrived I thought it w defective or that I had gotten the wrong one because I could not get the retention strap around the hammer and to snap. I pulled and stretched the leather for about 30 minutes, and finally I got it to snap. After I got the leather worked in that first day, now it fits perfectly. It snaps and unsnaps easily, but not too easily, and it provides a very secure and tight hold!Just take the time to work the strap in."
3,try No Nonsense instead,"I bought these panties to have breathable wicking underwear for outdoor activities. These are somewhat uncomfortable because the elastic pulls on my skin, and the waistband is gathered. I bought the No Nonsense Microfiber Bikini PantiesNo Nonsense Women's Microfiber Bikini Panties, 2-PackNo Nonsense Women's Microfiber Hi Cut Panties, 2-Packat the same time, and they top these 100% because of the non-binding waist and leg-openings, a must for strenuous activities, and also do not show panty lines as much as these. The Vanity Fair Microfiber Hipsters are better than cotton for wicking and breathability, but are not the best out there."
4,Excellent Album,"This is the second of the Spacemen 3 discs I picked up and I like it even better than the first. The first was The Perfect Prescription, which is unbelievable. Both albums are phenomenal choices for everything from late-night listening to all-out rockin'. The tracks range from dreamy psychedelic wanderings (Honey, How Does It Feel, So Hot) to feedback-laden assaults (Suicide, Revolution). I've seen a lot of comparisons to the Velvet Underground in the reviews and I have to agree. It's got a very British garage-band minimalistic sound mixed in with incredible post-production and downright guitar genius.I'm a huge fan of Spiritualized and I am totally enjoying digging into the band's roots. I've also been checking out the other post-Spacemen outfits: Reverberation, Spectrum/E.A.R., Sonic Boom, and have liked all of it so far.This album is definitely worth buying."
5,"Spacemen 3: ""Playing With Fire""","Overall, this is a terrific album by one of my all-time favorite bands from the space rock sub-genre of alternative. And thanks to having found this here on amazon.com, I was able to complete work on a recent show of Under The Radar for the internet radio station, Flashback Alternatives, which featured psychedelic rock from the 1960s and 1970s, as well as space rock and neo-psychedelia, along with synhtpop/new wave and futuristic space pop from the 1980s and 1990s. For more information on the show, please feel free to visit this link: [...]"
4,songs with vocal are v.pretty,"i was driven to listen to spacemen 3 because of spiritualized,& the music written by Jason in ""playing with fire"" was quite simliar to spiritualized. ""come down softly to my soul"" & ""so hot.."" &""lord,can u hear me?"" are just perfect. the other pure musical tracks are just ok. b.t.w. personally i'm not into the more noisey tracks & the vocal of sonic boom in their ""Taking Drugs To Make Music To Take Drugs To"""
5,Answer To A Prayer,"Finally there is a comprehensive book in plain English that addresses how to sell books for the self-published author. Ms. Coleman-Willis' detailed reference guide will be a constant companion for those who desire to get their intellectual property into bookstores, libraries, book clubs and more. As an author, I was impressed with the volume of helpful information. I highly recommend this book to authors and publishers alike."
5,Beautiful!,"My 3-year-old has Jabberwocky memorized, and we love poring through this book while he ""reads"" it. It is completely unlike any popup book I've ever seen, with 3 layers of depth to the pictures. It's difficult to even describe, and I think it's the children's book we'd save in a fire if we could only save one."
1,Disappointing CD,"This is a lousy recording with crowd noise, bad recording levels, and terrible quality. I am sorry I bought it and have since gone with a better ""classic"" collection which better represents these fantastic harmonists. Do NOT buy this CD! unless you hate the Mills Brothers."
1,Bogus,"In my opinion, this is not in anyway, shape or form; any configuration past, present, or future, an authourized recording by The Mills Brothers. If a recording like this was released under the name and likeness of Frank Sinatra (may he rest in peace) it would be considered a crime scene. As for the Ink Spots, I am not sure whose protecting their reputation, but I beleive the originals would turn in their graves! Perhaps a different title could be used for this recording. I suggest ""The Butchering of Great Artists"". If this was medicine, someone would be sued for malpractice."
5,Great for Non-Experts,"I'm only a dabbler in classical music - I own may 2 dozen classical CD's total.But this is at the top of the list. I can't get enough of it; when I put it on I have to stop what I'm doing and just have to sit down and listen - and this after many many re-playings.Sorry I don't have the vocabulary or knowledge to explain why this one is so good. But if you're looking for your first string 4tet experience, this one certainly worked for me!"
4,"Mom, You're the Best!",These little sayings really can make Mom feel great! It's really a great gift. I love the full color illustrations as well.
5,I LOVE NICKY D.,"I met Mr. Nicky D. last night at my dad's party for his work,I like the way nicky sang that song Mrs. jones, I think he isa nice man. He gave my mom and dad this cd uptown mood. he isgreat!"
5,Excellent Ryan Cohan work,"Simply Ryan Cohan at his best. You will love this album. If you are not familiar with Ryan Cohan and his group, give them a try."
1,Bilge of the Communist studios,"The Communist era is best known for grandiose pompous art, that can be enjoyed for some of its dramatic flair, aggression or harping over class inequities. Unfortunately this book showcases none of that genre. It is a selective presentation of unimaginative talentless minimalist junk, mostly printed in black and white. The Soviets did have some original strains of modern art in their propaganda machinery, but little of it is reproduced here. This is just a sad cocktail of unoriginal ideas - borrowed from the West and executed poorly (an artistic equivalent of industrial rip-offs of Western consumer goods from the same era). If you want to see some original and funky modern Communist posters, see ""Revolucion: Cuban Poster Art"" by Lincoln Cushing."
5,"The ""Original"", before the ""Dummies"" book","For me, this is a very useful book and it covers a multitude of subjects pertaining to raising chickens. It isn't the ""last answer"" you'll find a need for but it is a very good 'starter' book for 'newbies' before they bring the first baby chick home. I'd bent lent a copy and found it good enough to order my own copy so I could refer to it as needed."
2,We're not a colony anymore,"The information would be really good if it were directed at an American audience. Breed, food sources are problems since this is an English publication!"
2,Not really that good,"I purchased the book thinking it was an account of what happened to Thomas Andrews on the last moments of the great ship. Instead I found it a "" reincarnation "" story, and some aspects confuse me. For example there are some metal properties which were not discovered until 1947, yet Thomas Andrews amazingly knows them in 1912. The author has written a good book, and I was happy with his author ability, but if your looking for an account of Thomas Andrews, a real account, this isn't the book for you"
5,A dramatic account that has the ring of truth.,Interweaving the regression tape with the general narration gives the listener the eerie sensation of being a fly on the wall while Thomas Andrews goes through the overwhelming realization that his ship and most of her passengers are doomed.
1,A Wild Imagination,"This book is a good example of jumping on the Titanic hysteria bandwagon. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the first author is the reincarnation of the Titanic builder. There is no evidence that there is such a thing as a past life or past life regression hypnosis that is genuine. The authors obviously did some homework on the Titanic and put together a nice little story laced with some wild imagination. There are no secrets here that were not available to anyone who had wanted to do a little probing into the life of the builder of the Titanic. In short, the book is a hoax, albeit more entertaining than the recent dismal movie."
2,both views,"This is my first time reading Sara Craven, and I have to say I was disappointed. The marriage proposal out of the blue could have worked - IF - she wrote about both sides of the story, but not just the heroine's. I understand Chessie's belief on the relationship with Miles Hunter to be a 'working relationship', but the story could have opened up a lot if Ms. Craven revealed Miles' character. Before the accident, he did lead a normal life and now the restrictions put on him and how he feels about it might have increased her rating a little.I have to agree with the other reviewers that the sex scene was mediocre good. Well, it was the best in the book. Linnet - the bitchy lady - again could have worked if it was explained more; and Alistair if the author wrote about Mile's prospective and if he was jealous.If you want to read it, go ahead and pick it up, but I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,They sell returned goods,I was very disappointed with this item. This is clearly a returned item and packed with a broken box. This is a prestige item and is a gift. I paid full price but got a used item. Go buy direct from Waterford you pay full price and get brand new stuff.Too late to return as this is a Christmas present for my wife. I have to tell my wife I got it from Amazon.com. Shame on you Amazon!
2,Seams split easily,"This is a comfortable tube and has a heavy gauge vinyl, however out of four, three have split seams the very first time we inflated them. No we did not over inflate. The tears are in the seam for the cooler lid. I called the manufacturer and was told that they would not replace them."
2,Misleading photo,The photo shows 4 pans however this posting and price is only for 1 pan. I was very disappointed when I received this single product at home. Make sure the title states set of 4 before purchasing.
4,Hot Hot Hot,"Great compilation of stories. Definately some keepers here that will forever run rampant with your imagination. And don't worry - the stories each live up to the cover art, with twists and turns that elevate this collection of fiction above mere erotica to great writing.Definitely a keeper."
3,Ick,"You know for S/m it was a wonderfully done book and all but...it's written too darkly. Which sometimes is a good thing. But I think that erotica should have an air of lightness to them. If you like despair and no hope of happiness, or like people getting brutalized then this gem/coal lump is for you.Remember, well written. But bad form. Bad bad form."
4,Interesting,Smitten: A Long Time Ago...in a Far Away Land...Interesting documentary. It wasn't all that enlightening. It did explain Diana as a complex person a little more than others. Consider we are all complex people entangled and weighed down by our created and learned baggage.
1,Incredibly Offensive. Huge Disappointment,"I've been a huge Lewis Black admirer for a long time, spending money on concert tickets, books and dvds, and was excited to receive this dvd. But now I feel like a complete schmuck. I was horrified at the ""gynecologist"" sketch. Apparently he thinks that women who go to the gynecologist just sit there in the little rooms completely naked, all juiced up and waiting for somebody to screw. It certainly wasn't comedy, so I guess it was supposed to be soft porn. I was going to send it back and get a refund, but I'm going to destroy it so no one else will have to see it."
1,Stay away from this.,"I love Lewis Black but this is a piece of garbage. The are not any laughs in either these two stupid, worthless shorts. If I could I would give this zero stars. There are no redeeming qualities about this dvd."
5,I like this pitcher to use when I have company,This is a darling pitcher. I use it when people come over and it is just what is needed.
5,Love the style!,"Love the art deco style of this pitcher! Although I have many Fiestaware dishes, I only use this pitcher to decorate in my kitchen. So glad Amazon had it in black as I could not find it in black anywhere else."
5,"Lovely, with minor imperfections","As is the case with all Fiesta, this piece contains a few minor blemishes. Nothing that I count against it though, as I think it adds to the retro charm. A lovely piece to add to your collection."
1,Fiesta Pitcher,"I would love to be able to review this item.But, I ordered it twice in Scarlet, and twice I was sent the wrong color and had to send it back. I gave up."
5,I have always wanted one of these !!,"And when it came up on my Gold Box offers, I couldn't resist ! And it is great !! Heavy duty without feeling too heavy, this pitcher makes any occasion a bit more special !! And it looks great in my yellow kitchen to boot !! Stylish, slightly retro and looks beautiful ! What more could you ask ??"
5,Black Pitcher,"It does function well, hmmmmm... kinda like a pitcher, and looks great as an accent with my black appliances."
5,Truly a great read!,"As a part-time professional magician and performer, I loved this book for its attention to historical detail and Mr. Karges' real love for his art. But my enjoyment of the book doesn't stop there.It is truly a wonderful book. It is full of joy, of clarity, and a love for life so strong and enduring that it almost glows. He captures in a small yet meaningful way what it means to love, and be loved, by another... what it means to find a path in life that gives others, as well as yourself, great happiness... and what it means to leave a legacy for others in the future.In short - buy this book. You won't regret it."
1,Painfully disappointing,"This book is just not what it claims to be: a tale of real magic. Its authors make this claim: that Uri Geller wields powerful paranormal talents. He doesn't. Uri Geller is a pathetic fraud, and portraying him as not just sympathetic but as a heroic truth-teller and magician is just flat-out wrong. I hoped for an awful lot more than this book delivers."
1,Not The Real Thing,"These people probably legitimately inherited the name ""The Ink Spots"" but, to those of us who grew up listening to the originals, they don't even come close to the style and substance we enjoyed. Go and look for those recordings - available on Amazon - and ignore this group who are about half as good when imitating the original group and who are sometimes even poor when doing material in a style the old group would never have attempted. I've bought these recordings before, to my dismay. Get the real Ink Spots and forget this poor imitation."
1,Wrong Pan,"This Calphalon omelet pan is a dreadful mistake for anyone who is accustomed to flipping the contents of a pan. Mine, despite being brand new and treated extremely well, was and is very sticky. You can't separate the egg from the stainless without a crowbar (be sure to use a wooden one, to avoid damaging the pan). No amount of oil will help...Also, and this is far more disturbing, the edge of the pan is at a very light angle, does not have a steep angle to help the flipping process....so if you decide to saute vegetables or anything in small pieces, if you try to flip them, you will need to snap your wrist like a bronco rider pulling the reins of an unruly horse.... and you will still lose a piece or two, unless you get it just right... Furthermore, if you surrender and pull out a wooden spoon, the very short wall of the pan will ensure that you spill at least some of the contents onto the stove when you stir.Pretty pan, but altogether the wrong pan for cooking."
1,Henkel 1481 Duck 3/4-by-12-Inch Hook & Loop Fasteners,"I used the hook & loop fastener to attach an 8 1/2 x 11 inch,6oz whiteboard to the fridge. It fell to the floor after 3 weeks. I will not recommend this product."
3,Strike Freedom is not the best build ever,"I purchased this model as my first from the SEED/DESTINY universe. It's not a bad model, just a bit fickle. The gold colored movable frame skeleton is pretty sweet (its a dull metallic PET plastic not the super-shiny plastic that the shine and color flake off). That is about where the good ends with this model. The antennae break way too easy, barely touching them while posing the model for the first time snapped the right hand side of both the white and yellow right off. The model is super back-heavy due to the massive DRAGOON wing system, the only thing that offsets this is the giant stand that comes with it (but this is far too tall for my display). The model itself can barely support itself standing up let alone hold up it's weapons. All in all I would say avoid this kit unless Strike Freedom is your absolute favorite Gundam (Destiny is a much better build)."
1,Dont buy it,OK when I was building this model I was so excited till I got to finishing the legs I noticed the feet have no support and this model was ment to be on a stand where he fails big time are the Dragoons(jets) on his back are so heavy you cant keep him in a pose and he has a very hard time holding his weapons he is a nice expensive brick is all he is.any model with the big backpacks dont buy you cant do much with them this model was just a heartbreak for me since I love the seed series.Wing Zero Custom is the same way but not as bad there nearly the same kit with diffrent look.If you want a kit for having in any pose with no problem my advise is Burning Gundam or ZZ Gundam(stay away from full armor mode its another expensive brick)
3,Rather pointless and overrated garage psych...,"I have a lot of 60's albums and especially in the psychedelic genre, so I decided to look this up after some raving reviews. But it is a very bleak and disappointing affair, never really pulling it off. I would say that about half the album is good with strong melodies, but then unfortunately it gets off in the wrong direction into pointless jamming, drumsolos and other stuff that quite quickly makes me switch cd. Not even close to a classic but worth checking out if you like tripped out monotonous acid rock which goes nowhere. Overrated!"
4,Great Buy,"I bought this set for my mother and she loved it, so much so that I bought the next set. If you enjoy period drama then you can't really go wrong with this collection"
2,The images freeze and I would prefer lose caption,I love the stories and I had some on vhs but this is a very poor quality and you cannot enjoy it the ou should. Also no close caption
3,FINALLY ON DVD!!!,"OMG, it sure took them long enough to finally start putting her other films on DVD! I don't like all of her stories, but i do like many of them. Not that i read a lot, i don't, but i love watcbing films...esp. period films. Am just glad that now we'll get the chance to have them in a better format...and, in boxed sets no less!BTW, am giving this set 3 stars because, even though i have not seen it yet, am hoping they did a good job in video transfer. But i gave it 3 stars just based on how much i like her stories."
3,Not as good as I expected..,"I love the West Coast. I love Snoop, Nate, Kurupt, Tha Eastsidaz, all of em on this CD (except for D12, and Tha Angel's arn't that good ethier). But I felt like this CD was a dissapointment. It was on Snoop's label, Dogghouse, and saw the roster, so I picked it up. I was dissapointed alot. It's decent, but nothing ground breaking. Snoop is doing to much.. he needs to take a break for a little while and get those creative juice flowing better again. The production isn't that good ethier. Though I have to admit that it's a pretty good idea to have the soundtrack of the movie, actually have something to do with the movie than just background music. But it was poorly excuted. I don't really plan on seeing this movie anyways, but that's really because I'm not a horror flim fan. I'm looking real foward to ""The Wash"" with Dre, hopefully the soundtrack will be pretty good too. Anyways, still got mad love for Snoop and all them. West Coast -- Southern Cal-i-fornia 4 eva!"
5,scared of these bones,"a improvement over the last 2 snoop projrcts,lots of artists kokane i'm feeling, i'm feeling letoya williams, this whole cd is tight, but snoop will never live up to his doggystyle days, d12 talks about doing drugs the sequel yo purple pills,where slim talks about dying cause of drugs, like i said tight, nate dogg fans will love his contributions to this soundtrack, and for the old heads there is the classic william devaugn be thankful for what you got."
3,Meh...,"Bought this thinking it would be similar to the original Kingdom Hearts Strategy Guide. Simply speaking, its not. Poor layout, lots of fluff, frustrating gummi and synthesize sections. I mean, it definitely helps if you want to complete the game 100%, but overall the guide is just... meh."
2,Fluff and Fancy,"If you're a fan of KH1 who enjoyed the KH strategy guide by Dan Birlew, then, like me, you may find yourself frustrated with this Kingdom Hearts 2 strategy guide. The first game's guide provided information as a glossary and as a walk-thru. If you had a question about something in KH1, you could easily find and turn to the corresponding section of its guide for answers. Why didn't the writers of the sequel's guide stick with what worked? I can only guess that they were more interested in style than substance. This book is fat because it is inefficient, full of fluff and fanciful designs that make finding information cumbersome and frustrating. Using Deats' guide, unfortunately, is a distraction from the game rather than a quick reference. I love the Kingdom Hearts series, but I didn't buy this guide for fanfare and souvenir. It will probably be best to go to a gamer's website and download a copy of someone else's guide and/or walk-through as this guide is sorely lacking utility."
3,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"I had high expectations for this guide, only to discover the book was far from perfect. The guide appears to go in-depth of Kingdom Hearts II, but hardly covers any ground. It has plenty of beautiful pictures, but not even that can make up for the walkthrough. The walkthrough is weak since it is only composed of a few pictures known as ""key points."" The boss battles are covered and the strategies they list are somewhat helpful. What hinders this book more is its lack of coverage regarding the Underdrome and synthesis. If you are to purchase this guide, expect to use only the bestiary and the Drive coverage."
3,Enough To Get You Through,"This book will no doubt help you get through the game, but it has terrible orginization, such as character bios being scattered throughout the walkthrough. All mini game information is also scattered, some being several pages after where the mini game originally appeared. The major downfall to this book is that it will not tell you where items or maps are. You're left to explore all that for yourself, so hopefully you've played the first and know to explore, explore, explore. Other than that, the actual walkthrough part is alright and there is good information and level up charts for the characters and forms."
4,I got this for my sister.,She got the game also and says it helps out a lot especially with this type of game.
3,"Great game, bad guide","While the guide has great map layouts, it is in no way as comprehensive as it claims. Every KH fan would know that item synthesis is a intergal part of the game. They provide nothing on the subject besides the materials given. Many, many mistakes has been found in the book. I guess thats what we get since they rushed it out."
5,Favorite out of the series,"Out of the ones that I have read thus far, this is by far my favorite! Morrigan is indeed impulsive and arrogant, but she's also strong willed, caring and pretty confused about her feelings a majority of the novel... but, that's what makes the story so great---she actually seems like a real person! If she only portrayed characteristics that embodied perfection, she'd be absolutely boring.Another reason I loved this novel was because it was friggin' hilarious at times. I almost died laughing when I was reading about her skills at cooking and cleaning. I also like that all the books in the story end well, and so I'm always content--- other than wishing they never ended. Can't wait to finish all of this author's novels!"
2,2.5 stars - don't let this though deter you from reading book 2 of the series,"I did not like the heroine who was basically a shoddy National Enquirer type of reporter, It was hard for me to find where she would be a great match for the future King. Felt if she had been more written up as the clever hard nosed business woman from a super high tech planet there might have been more of a premise or a main character whom you want to follow and root for. Instead Morrigan just got worse with her gullibility (she just totally buys her husband's story that she is an indentured slave) and lack of class.The good news is that book 2 is worth reading, so don't let this one discourage you."
1,clichés and plotholes galore,"I didn't have high expectations reading this book, but despite that, I was sorely disappointed.Morrigan is annoying, impulsive, arrogant, idiotic. She's supposed to be a reporter but doesn't do research and is ignorant of the planet's cultures. But wait! HUGE GAPING PLOT HOLE ALERT! In the beginning of the novel, the catty other brides-to-be made a big deal about Morrigan finishing her uploads first, unlike some of them who didn't even bother watching a single one. So why did she suddenly become the fish-out-of-water can't-do-anything-right helpless heroine trapped by Mr. Caveman and his customs? WTH? Her ignorance of their customs and deliberate insults bordered on racism. If you were a /supposedly/ smart, independent, sassy reporter, do you think the right way to fix a misunderstanding is to be the biggest bitch on the planet?I read this for the porn, but jfc the characterizations were absolutely horrid."
3,not what i expected,"i ordered 2 of these ottomans to complete the decor for our covered lanai. i was surprised to find out the cushions are green - based on the picture, i was expecting them in cream - but fortunately we have green in our decor.they aren't the sturdiest of ottomans, pretty light weight and move very easily. my younger kids are constantly trying to sit on them, but the ottomans always slide back making the kids fall on their butts! but i guess you get what you pay for.i did attempt to return the ottomans, but the shipping costs more than the ottomans themselves!"
1,Watch out,"Don't get fooled, I'm surprised Amazon has not caught this. Clearley bootleg. $199.00! C'mon man. I have all of these cut's that you have listed plus more!!! Like 2000 more. I am willing to give copies away for free without the art work of course. Does not take much to create your own cover art work. You must really need some money dude!! Whay don't you buy all my stuff!!"
1,not great,"major error in acid base sectiontoo tediousbadly organizedincompletenot enough application opportunity--- and i had the dvd's toolet's find the most complicated way to explain as little as possibleok so i did learn a couple of things ...but overall...rather badthough it's a bit annoying, i like exam krackers much betterthe audio cd's do have some minor errors but are still much less painful for studying"
5,Really keeps things warm,"This is a big, ugly, plastic beast. It will win no awards for beauty. It does, however, do something absolutely amazing--it allows me to cook pancakes, waffles, or tortillas and actually sit down and eat with my family. I used to hate making pancakes for breakfast because I'd be stuck over a hot griddle while everyone else ate, or I'd have to heat up the oven to keep them warm. This thing keeps them hot throughout the entire meal. I do get some condensation dripping from the lid, but a small washcloth placed on top of whatever I'm making soaks it up and it isn't a problem. For such a simple thing, this gets used a lot at my house."
4,BIG tortilla keeper,"I wanted a tortilla keeper to keep tortillas warm for my family meals. I was expecting it to be about the size of the containers you would find at a Mexican food restaurant, but was surprised to find that it was much larger!I think it would hold about 3 dozed large( burrito sized) tortillas. besides the size, I am very happy with it and have found that it works well for rolls and muffins."
5,Excellent Product,"Its better than I thought it would be. Very happy with the Product, and it does keep my Tortillas very warm. I highly recommend it."
4,It Works,"Purchased this as present to go with a new tortilla maker. It works great to keep tortillas, pancakes and waffles warm and moist. I purchased the large one and would recommend that anyone buying one of these do the same, it makes much more versatile."
3,average tortilla keeper,"After all the reviews, I decided to order for this. Practically,it isn't warm enough for tortilla.I used several times but unfortunately this doesn't work for me very well. I don't know whether I didn't cook much of tortillas so the temperature doesn't keep it as suppose to be or what. usually I cook 8-15 tortillas and right before serve, I use microwave for 30-60 seconds to keep warm. this happens within an hour, but when we eat, tortillas are getting cold.disappointing but since I bough, I will use for a while. I don't recommand this product."
5,The Really Ribbed Abs smells like CK1,"The Bod Man Really Ripped Abs fragrance has that clean fresh ""just got out of the shower"" smell, that mimics CK1.Well worth the price if you like that smell."
2,P U !! Have you RE-FORMULATED Bod Man?????,"I used to LOVE this spray -- it was fresh-smelling, macho, sexy in an understated way, and made me a MAGNET. Everyone around me LOVED it.But now, this new batch in the tinted dark-blue bottle with the black spray head -- is NOT the ""Bod Man Really Ripped Abs"" I used to know and love.It's pungent, tinny, sharp, overpowering.What happened..................?I ordered two bottles and although I probably should return them, I'll try diluting them with water -- with the hope that maybe that will cut the fragrance a bit so it's usable.But I am VERY VERY disappointed."
3,No Digital Copy included!!!,"I ordered this ""Digital Copy Edition"" for the iTunes Digital Copy primarily, with the thought that I could use the Blu-Ray disk when got a Blu-Ray player.Well, the version I received didn't come with a digital copy. The seller NEVER replied to my inquiries about it. It's been weeks now with no reply at all.Ultimately, Amazon refunded my full purchase price without asking for the disk back.So, I ended up with a free Blu-Ray disk, and using my $15 refund was able to purchase the digital copy directly from iTunes.I would rate the movie closer to 4 1/2 stars as I consider it a great update on the old campy classic franchise. As much as I enjoyed some of the installments in that series, I really felt like this version updated the characters very well and brought them into the new age of horror/slasher films we've come to enjoy in recent years."
1,Now this was a remake that didn't cut it...,"Trust me when I say that I am a true fan of anything that includes Jason Voorhees. It's true, he's even my background on my computer! But when I saw this, I just couldn't stomach it. Now it wasn't exactly a movie I hated with a passion, but it's definitely only a one-time watch for me. If you're familiar with the old Jason, you probably won't like this - obviously. They had a few of the same kills as they've already done in the original movies, which I thought was really lazy. I mean, a part of the film maker's favorite things to do with the series was create NEW and INNOVATIVE deaths amongst the characters. Not to mention, Jason decides to keep one of the campers chained up in his house and not even kill her... yeah, right. Like Mr. Voorhees would be caught dead letting anyone live. I don't know, I guess I just need to stick to the old movies. That doesn't mean I'm gonna pass up on making fun of the sequel when it comes out though. Not a chance."
3,Toooo Many Friday the 13th's,"I personally enjoyed the original Friday the 13th that somewhat set off a trend of teenage slasher movies..it was something new at that time. However now we have countless such slasher movies with just more inovative ways to kill a person..add to it some more nudity & camera angles..the fear & suspence element is missing.we have seen remakes of our favourite horrors like; Halloween, Omen, Friday the 13th etc..when will some really good film maker/studio attempt to remake the best of them all..THE EXORCIST?!"
1,WOW!...TERRIBLE Movie!!!,I LOVE blood and gore dont get me wrong but this movie just did nothing but dissapoint me the entire way through....Sorry Jason but this was garbage!
4,Friday the 13th at it's best.....,"I have to say that Marcus Nispel really hit the mark with this Friday the 13th remake...it's dark, creepy & Jason in all his infamous glory in the right mixture without being too over-the-top such as Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' remake. I know these days that a lot of people want GORE, GORE, GORE but to me that DOESN'T make a TRULY good horror movie. Yes some gore is necessary in a horror movie, but you only need enough to get the point & the rest has to be emphasized on the atmosphere of the story..in other words the characters, the scenery, the plot. And without a doubt Nispel picked a place PERFECT for Jason to wreak havoc on his young victims. If you didn't know, Nispel directed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake & as you watch this film you can truly see the similarities in terms of scenery & even plot lines but still this movie stands out in it's own right. GREAT story & imagery to bring new life to an old fan favorite horror series."
2,Blu-Ray version is garbage,Just going to make this quick. There are so many blurry scenes in this blu-ray that it is ridiculous. I am not sure if the dvd is just as bad. Either way just be prepared.
4,Sequel Not A Remake,3.5 - The first time I viewed the film I didn't really care for it too much but after I watched it again I really ended up enjoying it. Its a great ode to all the other friday the 13th films and they did a little history lesson at the beginning which I thought was cool especially if somebody hasn't seen the others. I would definitely check it out if you like slasher films. If you enjoyed Friday The 13th hit yes!!!

3,Cut Above .... Ahh...,"While Jason over the Yrs has looked Dead Tired.. in this Edition of Friday the 13th.. He Appears to have run out of energy as well and while chasing one soon to be victim , he stops and pauses and then throws the hand axe the rest of the way and well you get the idea.... So a cut above ...... 3 out of 5 well you get it..."
5,Good,"Can't argue with the movie, it followed the old Friday the 13th very well and added some more good stuff to it that it didn't destroy the movie/story."
2,it was just ok,NOTHING SPECIAL HERE. THE ENDING SUCKED. I WONT SPOIL IT FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN IT YET. IT HAD A VERY BIG OPENING WEEKEND BUT DROPPED LIKE 70% BY WEEK TWO. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR RENT DONT BUY. THE WRITTERS DID A GREAT JOB WITH FREDDY VS JASON BUT NOT WITH THIS FLICK.
3,Damn,"First off, i'm a HUUUGGEEEE Jason Voorhees fan and have all the Friday the 13th films, this remake wasn't too bad, I was just disappointed that the kills werent creative enough or as gory. I mean you had the frolicking teens, the sex and nudity(all necessary for a good slasher pic,lol), but the kills were kinda bland, it was cool to see Jay setting traps and running at people, it's just I wanted the ferocious killer Jason from Freddy VS Jason(like when he killed the dude on the bed..gruesome, lol), other than that it was a cool, pic, if you're a Friday fan get it(at least it's not another ""Jason goes to Hell""yuck)."
1,poor,"The most amateurish book I have ever read on health and diet. I really got the impression the author had done a little reading on these ideas and then decided to write his own book. Here's a sample of the writing style - on the topic of the Islets of Langerhans (the structures in the pancreas that produce insulin) he says ""Instead of picking on these little guys because of the funny name, you should know that these guys produce... insulin"". As for his diet, it's either well-known information (don't eat excessive sugar), or is stated without adequate justification (like eating complex carbohydrates in the day and protein at night). I'm not saying it's incorrect, I'm saying it needs justification and discussion. And as for the diet itself, with a title like the Evolution Diet, you might wonder why it contains amongst other things Cheerios, popcorn, Triscuit crackers, and diet root beer."
2,A waste,"This was a pretty amateurish book, IMO. I'm not an expert, but the timing of when you should eat various things seems dubious at best. Hunter/gatherers ate what was at hand. If they killed a large animal in the morning, I doubt they waited til evening to eat it.But what made this book the most amateurish was the extremely poor English usage. It seems like at least every page had an extra ""it"" where it didn't belong, or lacked ""the"" where there should have been one. I think this was caused by a failure to proofread. I cannot take any writer seriously who publishes a book with this many errors. After about 1/3 of the way through, I just scanned the rest of the book, having lost interest."
1,The Evolution Diet by Stephen Morse,"This book seems to have been written as a vanity publishing venture--as if a young man with leisure was told by his friends : ""You sure know a lot about diets, you should write a book."" I read the book thinking it would be related to Loren Cordain's ""Paleo Diet""-given the title-but the author seems to not know about the Paleo diet, which is the REAL evolutionary diet book. Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Pulsar watch,I love my watch. Had a little trouble setting it the first time but finally got it right. It is a beautiful item of jewelry as well as useful. Would highly recommend it to anyone. Wonderful congenial company to do business.
4,Very good read. Highly recommend but...,"I loved this story. Very tense, a compelling story. Well written characters and plot development. I am looking forward to reading the next two as well. My ""but..."" refers to two egregious errors: twice ""collaboration"" is used where ""corroboration"" is meant, and the all too often error ""just desserts"" is used instead of ""just deserts"". The first error I cannot fathom, unless the character has made this mistake?! The second is all too common. Deserts is what one deserves, not what one gets after supper. Don't let this comment keep you from enjoying this great story! (this refers to the kindle edition)"
1,Poorly done,This book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors making it annoying to read. The story is obscenely predictable. I will not continue this series of books.
5,A winner!,"My son desperately loves anything Star Wars, but being as he is only 5, we limit him on what he can have. The Galactic Heroes collection is wonderful. The pillowcase comes with Darth Vader on one side and Yoda on the other. They aren't the highest thread count, but what 5 year old cares about thread counts? They are soft enough and just adorable!"
4,Love poems will just make you feel good!,The cover is very eye-catching. I have always liked poems and have written poems and this book was excellent. I loved the variety and the images too. I like poems that rhyme but also enjoy poems that don't rhyme. This book contains short poems that are delightful. Very well put together. Recommended!
4,Wonderful Betty Hutton,"This DVD contains two of Betty Hutton's best films, The Stork Club (1945) and The Perils Of Pauline (1946). The former is the best of the two. The music is terrific, and the chemistry between Barry Fitzgerald and Hutton is something to behold. Perils contains too much soap opera, and John Lund is almost a statue. But Betty shines once again in the musical numbers, proves herself to be a fine comedian, and she could act! Enjoy. One wishes Hutton had signed with a better film company, for her talents were formidable, and few of her films display them all. Paramount's musical numbers, especially the choreography, pale badly when compared with MGM's."
2,Good Group - Bad Collection,"Although Vee-Jay released 20 singles by the Spaniels over the years with almost all having 2 good or better sides, this compilation of 24 tracks contains only 16 different songs by the Spaniels. I like ""Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight"" and ""Peace Of Mind"", but 3 versions of each in 1 CD is rediculous. Save your money and wait for a real collection of Spaniels music."
5,ladies you know the truth hurts,"I think both songs are really good. When I first heard TLC's NO SCRUBS I thought here we go again women male bashing. But respect must be given where its due because the song did hit some home truths right on the head, then thankfully no pigeons did the same with a devasting blow because you ladies know the truth hurts. On that note little else needs to be said."
5,Finally!,"This book helped me gain enormous insight into myself and also create a compassionate space in which to parent. It is not an easy read, but it is important and well worth the effort. I've read some beautiful parenting books, but what many of them lack is what this book presents so beautifully. Until you can understand yourself better, all of the good intentions in the world will just crash down, leaving you feeling like a failure. I am so grateful that this book found me."
2,Sheesh.,"Anyone who has spent even just ten minutes in therapy and/or has one remotely sensitive bone in their body does not need to read this book. The title should have been ""Parenting From The Inside Out: Duh, Your Past Experiences Inform Your Relationships And If You Don't Know That Then You Are Not Old Enough To Be A Parent"".I found that the one author's recount of coldly stabbing sick children with needles during his internship, uncaring to their cries of pain, lent more insight into the way HIS mind worked and why someone like him would desperately need a book like this. The self-congratulatory tone makes it all the worse.Any kind and caring reader who is in touch with their own feelings and understands themselves is wasting their money. If you want to know how the brain works on a technical level (also included in the book) you can get just as much info on Wikipedia and save yourself the dough ... and a more than a few eye-rolls."
3,"Good insights, slow read","This book has many honest, pure, good ideas about parenting, and each is thoroughly researched and supported.However, not a single idea seemed fresh, and none changed the way I parented. This may be because the book was laborious to read. I found myself far too often bored. And I really wanted to read and enjoy this book in order to become a better parent.I guess I am a good enough parent already."
1,"Terrible, Awful, Disgusting Book","This book is a christian book, it doesn't say it on the cover, but talks about Adam and Eve, etc. That is not what I found awful about this book.This book, on page 70 or close to it, recommends that if you have a ""back talking 5 YEAR OLD"" to let the 5 year old get beat up by the neighborhood bullies, and that will teach him not to back talk. I didn't read any more of this book after that. I was too disgusted by this advice. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Any book that advises you to let bullies teach what a parent should be teaching by beating up a kindergartener should be banned from stores."
3,book - Parenting from the inside out from Amazon,"The book came really fast. The mail service was good. The book was recommended to me by a friend, but I'm not sure I like the book. I am not real motivated to read it."
5,Enterprise Series... worth the $$$,"I bought this series on Amazon, mainly because it was $40 cheaper then anything I could find on e-bay.I'm a Trekker so I'm bias. So I won't go into detail why I think this Trek series was one of the best of all the all TV Trek series.Ah, the item itself... beautifully packaged. The plastic containers that each of the 4 seasons comes in, looks like the old tricorder Bones McCoy or Spock use to sling over their shoulder when they would be part of a landing party. The disc themselves are in a deep blue DVD holder case opening like a book, with 5 ""pages"", one ""page"" to store each disc. A plastic sleeve slides over that to keep the DVD holder case from opening (like a book).There is a booklet with each season summarizing each episode.This item will probably follow me throughout my life. Maybe becoming part of my future library."
3,For the love of Scott Bakula,"I caught some episodes of Season 1 and decided I wanted to see more of Capt Jonathon Archer and the first Enterprise. It was also cool to have a lesser-known Rod Stewart song be the series theme song. (Which by the way was also in Patch Adams.)So while I don't regret getting the 4 season set, I did not find the entire series compelling. Good enough, but nothing ground breaking besides the ""retro-continuity"" fixing why klingons don't have bumpy foreheads in the TOS, etc.I also liked the Brent Spiner guest-star episodes (big fan of Spiner).I thought the Temporal Cold War was a bad idea, and the Xindi War was an unnecessary diversion."
3,"Finally Got the Packaging Right, But...","After ~loving~ ""The Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"", (and ~hating~ the disgraceful DVD packaging) I was really looking forward to this. But ""Enterprise"" appears to cater to the Dateless-Wonder/Teenaged male segment of the Trekkie populace.Seems like every other episode contains some juvenile scenario with the supermodel-Vulcan science officer T'Pol getting rubbed down with decon-ointment or in the throes of accelerated Vulcan mating drive with some hapless (& geeky & chubby) doctor.And the soundtrack is an awful, awful Christian-Rock ballad.If you are a 13-year-old male and like the idea of a supermodel falling breasts-first into the face of her captain when the ship gets jarred, you'll love ""Enterprise.""It's not horrible, but nowhere near as good as TNG, VOY, or TOS."
5,DOUBLE THUMBS UP FOR STAR TREK,Star Trek: Enterprise: The Complete SeriesONCE AGAIN GREAT SET OF DVD'S FOR THE MONEY. THE DVD BOXES ARE INCREDIABLE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE COMPLETE SERIES SO IT WAS GREAT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THEM BEGINNING TO END.
4,False Expectations,"The biggest problem that I saw with Enterprise was that it took place after all the previous series. People's expectations and preconceived ideas as to what the show should be is the biggest downfall to this series. I can't tell how many times I heard people preface their comments with "" I like the show but it's isn't like the original"" or ""it doesn't compare to TNG"". Enterprise is a good show. The plots were fine but I think people didn't let go of previous series and judged it against them. Scott Bakula's character was great and the relationship between Trip and Tapal was fun. The ending to the series stank because there were so many potential story lines that could have been explored and weren't. Given that it still was pretty good."
3,not as pictured,"While the series itself is fine, the item I received from the vendor was not the one pictured but a much cheaper version with all 4 seasons in one box that was manufacturer in Asia. The menu on the DVDs did not work properly. The breif discriptions on the episode were missing as was the art work, etc. Unless you are willing to accept these failings I would strong recommend that you make sure that the vendor you are dealing with is selling the official USA release.However the vendor agree to a return of the item and refunded my money."
3,Typical Poor Quality from Amazon,"I was not pleased that the first disk contained several commercials, even before you were able to get to the Enterprise content. Most annoying. The series was great, and shouldn't have gone off the air. For me, this collection was a chance to see all the episodes that I hadn't seen. It was like having the series in new release again. The most disappointing part of this collection as purchased from Amazon was the fact that all the so-called, ""Extra Features"" were not viewable, for some technical reason. You only get to ""see"" pixels of the features. This was true of not only this ""Complete Seasons 1-4"" of Enterprise, but of all the complete seasons of all the Star Trek series I've purchased from Amazon. They bait and switch you. They say they've never been used, or are original product from the manufacturer. Which may be true, but these DVDs certainly are not error free. I was very dissappointed. I would not recommend buying any DVDs from Amazon. Look elsewhere."
1,Move Forward,Star Trek needs to learn to move forward not backwards. I couldn't stand Enterprise. I think this series was a waste of time.
1,Buy all 4 Seasons & Pay More than Buying Individually!?!?,54.99 x 4 = 219.96vs.249.98Am I missing something?
4,Best of the spin-offs,"I was so sick and tried of bad Star Trek spin-offs, that I didnt watch this show when it was on the air.I recently started watching it in rerun's and discover it was really a great show. So much that I wanted to own it myself. Though they roughened the final show. It was disastrously bad. Bad mistake to include anything that had to do with TNG. This show could have spoken for its self in the end."
5,The perfect ending for the Star Trek Series,Perfect; I'd forgotten a lot of the episodes and this made me remember why I enjoyed this series so much.
5,Star Trek Enterprise as Good as Any,"The Star Trek Enterprise series was totally enjoyable. As the series went on I was able to get into all the characters and really liked the relationships between them. The quality of the dvds was great, and being in widescreen was a plus. I will watch the whole series again, and would recommend it to anyone who is a serious Star Trek fan."
3,Possibly the worst packaging ever,"When will the studios figure out we don't want elaborate DVD/Bluray packaging. We want simple, consistent, easy to access packaging. Not irregular shaped, hard to access, overpriced packaging. This series has some of the worst packaging I've seen. Whoever designed it an green lit its production should be fired.And this is yet another grossly overpriced Paramount product. Dear Paramount. Simplify and cost reduce your Star Trek series packaging, cut your price in half, and your volumes will double and you will kill the pirated DVD market. Wake up!That being said, fun series. Way better than the ratings indicated.Packaging - 1 starContent - 3.5-4 starsAverage (as a sold packaged product) - 3 stars...I just can't get by this disaster of packaging!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,This Series needs to be seen in it's original Hi-Def,"Disappointing on DVD. When this series appeared on UPN it was shown in Hi-Def. According to IMDB, this series was shot digitally in 1080P/24. I have a 70 inch Top-of-the-line Sony HD-TV (KDS-R70XBR2). The network HD showings were spectacular, especially the opening. The eye-poping picture you invite your friends over to see what Hi-Def truly is. The DVD release of Enterprise was not as good as most of the TNG DVD movies. I enjoyed the series in HD on the UPN network. I would buy the series on Blu-Ray when it is available in that format."
3,Star Trek New Generation,"It would be easy to view if it was easier to move from the just watched episode to the next on the disc - unfortunately, it only wants to play the one just played -how is it done?"
3,GREAT MOVIE,I CAN ONLY REVIEW THE SERVICE I RECEIVED AS I HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE YET. HAVE BEEN STUDYING AND LOOKING AFTER MY FAMILY SO NO TIME. I ALWAYS RECEIVE GREAT SERVICE FROM AMAZON THAT'S WHY I RETURN TO THE SIGHT. I LOVE TOM LONG SO THE MOVIE SHOULD BE AWESOME.THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT CONSIDERING THIS MOVIE IS AUSTRALIAN IT'S A BIT SAD THAT I HAD TO HAVE IT IMPORTED TO AUSTRALIA. I COULDN'T GET IT HERE!
5,Great Quality at a Reasonable Price,I have several Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper Pots/Pans. LOVE 'EM. Cooks great and looks beautiful. You can let the copper age and wear or use the polish to keep them bright. Great mid-price product if you can't afford the very expensive French brands.
4,"Quilting Patterns, NOT Quilt Patterns","Oops! Shame on me for not paying attention to the product description! I assumed ""Quilting Patterns"" meant ""Quilt Patterns"" so was somewhat chagrined when book arrived. However, it's a keeper. Found brief comparison between Lancaster County Amish and Midwestern Amish Quilts to be quite interesting."
3,"Quilt patterns are not ""quilting"" patterns!","What I thought I was buying was a book of Amish QUILT patterns but what I got was a book of patterns you use to do the actual quilting-- not how to construct quilt blocks. Another reviewer had the same issue with the terminology. Perhaps something can be done to specify more clearly the difference between the two terms-- novice quilters might not know. As it is, I bought another book with actual Amish QUILT patterns so I hope that is what I am looking for. Otherwise the book itself is very nicely laid out and the ""quilting"" designs overall are fairly elaborate."
2,"if looking for hard, solid facts move on","Giroux's book restates much of what he says in his other books (only with a few Disney anecdotes added). It took him two pages to say what could have been said in two sentences, and I found those same two pages popping up over and over again. I grew tired as I read, I was looking for substance. By the time I was half way through, I was skimming looking for him to say something new (he didn't)If you're looking for dirt on Disney, read Schweizer's ""Disney: The mouse betrayed"" Schweizer's book includes documentation of a pedophile problem at Disney, lack of safety at Disneyworld, Eisner dirt, criminal activity, Disney's link to porn..."
1,So poorly written that I couldn't get past chapter 2...,"I have a number of advanced degrees and am generally considered to be intelligent and extremely well read. This point is relevant only in so far as the fact that I could not get past chapter 2 of this book makes me wonder just what audience this author intended the work for. I found the ideas interesting and provocative, although I think he makes some significant leaps in his conclusions regarding Disney's attack of social justice. However, I just couldn't stomach the dry, hubris filled sentences that are laced with 4 syllable words. This book reads like someone's dissertation and really, who reads though for pleasure. Disapointing!"
5,The young MLK,"Volume 1 of the King papers goes to 1951, when M.L. King, Jr., was 22. There are childhood letters to parents, but more interesting are student essays from Morehouse and Crozer, which show King gaining confidence and sophistication as his education progressed."
4,sacred rose tarot deck,"this is an excellent intermediate deck. i really loved the designs and the vibrant colour. also, the meanings of each card are quite open to the reader's interpretation. (which as we all know, is quite important when the picture can differ from the meaning.) this is a great deck to advance to. and i consider it the ""sequel"" (hee hee) to the hanson roberts tarot deck. i highly reccomend both of them!"
3,The Fifteen Years Later Affair,"In true The Man from U.N.C.L.E fashion ""The Fifteen Years Later Affair,"" delivers the spy game with wit, fashion, and fun. A must for a true The Man from U.N.C.L.E. fan.."
3,"Not Too Disappointing ,","It was nice seeing the movie after so many years, but it was not what I would call classic Man from U.N.C.L.E.Not Bad, Not Great ,"
4,Talk about nostalgia!,"If you're feeling a bit nostalgic or just wondering what 'Ducky' from NCIS used to look like in his prime, you might enjoy this DVD. The special effects are very simple compared to today, but the movie is fun (I don't think the show ever took itself too seriously) and if you were a fan of the series or just want to see an example of what the series was like - this DVD is just what you are looking for."
2,Tired U.N.C.L.E. movie,"I watched this a couple of times, and the movie just doesn't work.Vaughn and McCallum are just too old to reprise their roles. Generic plot, and too much bad humor.Go to seasons 1 and 2 to get the best of U.N.C.L.E.Not recommended."
4,Nostalgic Stuff,"""Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair"" was a welcome affair. It is hard to go home again but Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo and David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin pull this one off as best as they can. Yearning for their days of glory this reunion TV movie plays about as well as one could expect. Yet it does capture some of the charm of the original series at times. It gets some endearing moments with the help of one of the original composers Gerald Fried.Open Channel D."
3,MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. DVD,GOT THE DVD. GOT ONE PROBLEM THE SELLER DID NOT EMAIL ME TO LET ME KNOW WHEN HE GOT THE ORDER NOR DID HE EMAIL ME WHEN THE ORDER GOT MAILED OUT.
4,Dispensationalists take note; your time really is short!,"Having many cassette tapes I have madefrom listening to John Noe and other'Preterists' (i.e. fulfilled prophesy)Christians on John Anderson's fineVoice of Reason show, I was familiarwith Mr Noe before reading his book.I can vouch for his sincerity andstudious approach to what is a sur-prisingly simple subject! Simply put,Mr. Moyer also wrote a very good reviewwhich I hope gets widely circulated.Mr. Noe is correct. It all transpiredin 70 A.D. Period. All is complete inJesus!"
1,ATD-8527 NOT A GOOD CHOICE!,"Unit arrived badly damaged, no chance to refuse delivery, just found it in driveway.NO packing around unit, just a thin cardboard box. NO PACKING at all. ALL 4 corners were damaged. Bent so bad top would not open. I fixed it up to save sending it back, just too lazy as I really should have returned it. Also found out AFTER I got it that it only can use [motor/pump I assume] water-based cleaning fluids. Having a hard time finding them and likely will not work very well as cleaning agent. Also be aware, if your not already, that this 40 gallon unit holds 20 gallons of fluid [max] and that could cost in excess of $250 to buy. If I had it to do over I would have bought another brand that could use non water-based cleaners and likely a smaller size to cut the cost down on the amount of cleaner needed to buy. Like I said, NOT A GOOD CHOICE!"
4,Great,"this is the second best Ehit album to date I think anyone looking for a cure to their gangster rap fetish ought to snap this one up with a quickness. I think his teaming with binky brings out a welcome new sound which only other songs on the album illustrate. Much better than automatic at that as ""automatic"" is cool track no 2 is cooler as is ""me and my bitch"" and ""keep your hood tight"". Bottom line buy it!"
2,Is not what I remember,"Well this CD is ok. But I wish people would really review the products much better. Some people might say that this CD is MC Eiht one of his best albums, but I think that this is not true. Even do you get MC Eigt rapping in one or two song is not worth bying this CD. I don't remember MC having a weak Cd like this one. I Remember him as a hard ass rapper and hard ass rimes but this Cd don't show his talent. Get it if you like Mack 10 Style of producing songs and rapping. If you want hard core rap from MC from Compton get Music to Drive to, By Compton Most Wanted."
2,Gyeaaaaaahhhhhh,"Gyeahhhhh! That's all I hear at the beginning of every single song...its pitiful, and all of the beats sound the same. I Like the song ""Thicker Than Water"", and then I like the Outro because it's one of the funniest I've ever heard. The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is because he is a veteran in this west coast rap game, and he has done much better then this. He should be back up soon."
3,too much a christian slant,this book seeks to validate (through footnotes) biblicalfairy tales. If the translator would have just stuck to the writings it would have made the read a bit more entertaining.
4,ABUNDANT FAITH!,"If you are low on faith in God or want to read a christian book this will be a JOY to read. The story is about Anya who faces a very devastating event and has to deal permanently with the repercussions of that event in more ways than one. I won't spill the beans about the challenge she is faced with, you'll just have to read it for yourself. The read is worth it. I must say I admired Anya's faith through it all and it encouraged me to increase my own faith in the Lord with my own personal challenges. I would have given the book a 5 star but the part in the book where the man gives Anya 3 $20's threw me for a loop and it was never clarified. Was Anya a prostitute? All in all it's still a good book and worthy to be read and enjoyed."
5,EXCEPTIONAL!!!!,"If you read Temptation by Ms Murray, then you already know how well she can incorporate a message of christianity into fiction and not be preachy.In Joy, you will not be disappointed. From page one, you are captiviated by the plights, the trials and tribulations of Anya and Braxton. A Christian couple engaged to be married, but it appears they may be unequally yoked and that could affect their relationship.Throw in a little mystery (stalker) and a few distractions (handsome co-worker), some family issues (Madear and Sasha) and you have a great novel that will keep you turning the pages, neglecting everything else you need to do.Scriptures sprinkled throughout the book that Anya relied on, can help anyone overcome obstacles they find in their way during their walk with God.This book I highly recommend."
3,left me wondering....,"this book was not a good sophmore attempt by Ms. Murray. my only issue was that it seemed predictable in parts, and did not go into enough depth in others.i understood Anya's faith and her desire to be all that God wanted her to be...so then why did she not see through her shallow, boring, and low-life fiance before the end of the novel???and what was considered to add suspense to the plot to me came off as poorly written. there may be a few women out there who would have made the same decision that Anya did if put in that situation but i personally don't think so!the author attempted to write a 'feel-good about God' book but i throughly disliked how naive she made the main character seem.her first novel 'Temptation' was much better.hopefully her third offering will be able to hold my attention"
5,All things work for the good of those that love HIM!!!,"Victoria has done it again! This is a phenominal book, written in true exellence!!!!! Once again,as with Temptation, I was up until the wee hours of the night unable to put this book down. This book tested my faith and encouraged my faith! This book reminds us that we never know how faithful we are until we have to be faithful. This book brings scripture to life and shows us, God can use any situation or circumstance for His Glory!"
5,Great Book.,This is a great book. It is very well written and it keeps the reader engaged. It keeps you guessing until the end!
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All I can say is this woman Victoria Chirstorpher Murray is a great writer. She knows how to lay out a book. This story will give you inspiration u never thought u had. I'm telling u have to read this book to know what I'm talking about.
5,a joy to read,Mrs. Murray could not have picked a better title for this book. This book was indeed a joy to read. I let this book sit on my shelf for about four or five months before I had a chance to read it. I am sorry it sat there as long as it did. Mrs. Murray's characters were so realistic. I wish I could have given it more stars. I must say again this book was DEFINITELY A JOY TO READ.
3,Couldn't get into it,"I've heard raves about Ms. Murray's work, so I ordered this book. Just didn't work for me. I like Christian fiction with real characters, but I couldn't personally identify with any of these Christians. Nor did I like them very much. Didn't finish it. Maybe I'll try it again later."
3,"The ""Joy"" Never Came..............","I purchased this book based on the reviews and that it was a Christian book, I wanted to broaden my approach to reading. However, I found that there wasn't enough character development surrounding certain characters and overkill on the others. I felt as though I ended the book with a lot of questions not being answered. Perhaps there will be a sequal?"
2,mis-wired,"The harness I received did not work and after some testing it seemed to be a bad relay which PIAA replaced; as soon as they were restocked, which took about three weeks, but that did not solve the problem. The second relay also seemed bad and after opening up the relay I learned that the 30 amp fuses were blown so I started to search for a short in the setup and learned that the wiring at the one end of the harness where it plugs go into the lamp plugs was reversed on one of the plugs, causing a short in the system. I could not remove the connector from the plugs to reverse them but was able to reverse the connection coming off the lamp which solved the problem. After explaining this to PIAA they did offer to have me return the harness in exchange for a new one but at this time I had already expended more time than I desired on this installation. The folks at PIAA were supportive."
2,weight loss book,Save your money. Nothing in here you can't find already on the internet. No great secrets. I read it once and have nevered picked it up again.
2,Somewhat useful,"I found this a bit of a disappointment after the quality of the Sybex Airwarrior II guide. Although there are some useful tips (especially modifying the open file system), it could have been a lot better."
1,Superficial and unhelpful,"Except for charts showing, off-road speeds, turret traverse speeds ans a scenario creation guide, this book tells nothing that a cursory glance at the manual and 15 minutes playing the game won't tell you. A severe disappointment is the lack of in-depth descriptions of campaign scenarios. Anyone with even a slight knowledge of WW II armor warfare will want to pass this by."
3,The Pres Redway Story,"THE PRES REDWAY STORY is a well-researched tale of the American Revolutionary period, rich in authentic details of life in the military and on the farm (many Revolutionary soldiers served for limited terms only, returning to their farms or businesses after their term was up). Although the enthusiasm of the young hero, Preserved Redway, and his girl friend, Polly Hall, for running strains credibility, other elements of the tale are solidly grounded in historical records, memoirs, letters, etc. Drama is supplied by the romance of Pres and Polly, set against the uncertain fortunes of war and the treason of Benedict Arnold, himself the respected hero of the Battle of Saratoga. In addition to Arnold, the reader will meet such notables as Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Sam Fraunce, the free black owner of famed Fraunce's Tavern, the redoubtable General Israel Putnam,and George Washington himself. This is a book for the history buff."
1,unwearable strapless bra,This bra has been stitched badly. It hurts to wear and has a big lump on one side.
1,I agree with Lois.,"I can't speak to the stitching, but the shaping was terrible and it was uneven. I would not recommend this bra, although I would recommend WonderBra in general because they make my favorite bra (the WonderBoost). I bought this deep plunge one at Kohl's and returned it the same day. What a disappointment!"
1,BRUCE HELMER'S SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL PLANNING,GARBAGE. SEEMS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN SELLING ANNUITIES AND CHARGING FEES.
5,For dog lovers everywhere it's a tug at the heart.,"My daughter read this book first and passed it on to me, knowing that I would love it. And I did. Lou Dean writes in such a way that I felt that I was seeing the world in a way that was new yet familiar. Any one who has ever loved a dog will relate to her tale of growing up with a best friend whose tail always wags when you enter the room. A friend who loves you for yourself and for no other reason. I cried and hugged my own two dogs during the last chapter. Cuddle up in your favorite chair with your best canine friend and lose yourself for an afternoon. This is a short, well-written coming of age story that I recommend unconditionally."
5,Touching tale of a young girls journey into womanhood,"I finished this book in two days. I could not put it down. This book recounts Lou Dean's life as a young girl and the troubled life she lead with a drunk mother. Her only comfort was her companion and friend her loving dog.If you are an animal lover, you will LOVE this book.Lou Dean is a talented writer. I wish she would write more....I would gobble all her books up!"
2,Greedy,"The initial design/engineering/materials/manfacturing/etc. endure just as intended: PLANNED OBSOLENCE.Replacements are limited, overly expensive, just as crappy as the originals, etc. - you're stuck.Unless you switch entirely to a different toilet - you can expect these problems over & over & over.Good Luck!"
3,TOTO handle every 3 years,"I remember the last Toto handle I bought only a few years ago through a local store (I may go there again today).Today I ordered 2 each on Amazon with 1 day delivery (arriving tomorrow).I am taking the broken handle assembly apart and only installing the new pot-metal handle handle, the plastic fulcrum piece, mounting screw, and rod are OK....its just the pot-metal handle slot that wears out.Toto should have put steel piece in the small slot in the handle to handle the wear and tear.Agree...order 2 each of these...and just install the handle piece that wear out...that way keep this Toto going for many more years."
1,what do I do now?,"I too receive a product the plastic case it came showed the product # thu 004-01..but the item was the wrong style and the wrong color..I can return it but how do I insure that I can get the correct item?TOTO THU004-01 Trip Lvr For St701Cst854884, Cotton Whitethe actual item I got was colonial white and a different design"
2,Not at all as described - disappointing,The frame did not come inside gray flannel drawstring bag & packaged in a heavy white moiré box embossed with silver lettering as described- no gray bag at all & in a plain navy box-very disappointed!
2,HUH? Why titled double helix?,"Only after page 200 did the mention of a virus even come up except for one sentence before that. Doesn't belong in the double helix series. Ridiculous, and not even much of a plot but more about sex and dumb jokes."
4,The 2nd Best of the Double Helix batch,"I consider this the second-best of the Double Helix novels, although you'll be quickly confused if you haven't kept up with the New Frontier novels. Peter David is a very capable storyteller and manages to keep things exciting to the end."
3,Ok but doesn't belong in double helix,This book would have been a good book as a regular book w/o being in the double helix series. I really hated Calhoun and how he seemed to be ale to do anything. I mean c'mon thats not realistic
4,A Deadly Virus That Could Destroy All!,"I have read all of the Star Trek: New Frontier books, and I think this one is one of the best! The plot was the best, the characters were commendable, and Jellico finally gets a close look at McKenzie Calhouns fist! Captain Calhoun's James Bond spy act was stupendous, as he tried to stop the evil from realeasing a deadly virus that could destroy all, called the Double Helix. McKenzie Calhoun meets up with Captain Picard to create a dramatically suspenseful book that will capture every science fiction fan alive!"
2,not that great,"i'm a fan of peter david, but this had to be one of the most convoluted trek books ever, i like the characters but the story felt idiotic and there never seemed to be a reason why they were all in this story...the characterisation of shelby and her interaction with riker was off the mark, she was not the same character"
4,Great piece but it DID change colour!,"The wife and I received this as part of a wedding present. It soon became my favourite piece of equipment in the kitchen. You can cook almost anything with this and, eventhough there will be a quarter inch of gunk stuck to the bottom, this will clean right off when you wash up.One slight criticism: both sides of the pan have changed colour; the bottom has gone more coppery, the top has taken on a dusty look to it. Still works fine, though."
5,WICKED AWESOME!,"Diru is one of THE best ever visual kei bands as far as anyone should be concerned. . . .Embryo is one of my favorite Dir en Grey songs ever for some reason. . .nope, wait. . . .I lied, I just love diru! The video rocks if you ever get to watch it, take the opportunity. . .but embryo really is a great song and dir en grey is worth the money any day. . . .so BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT!"
4,Finest piece of cookware I own,"I've always liked the Calphalon products, but I lost my whole set a few years ago. When I found this piece on sale at such a reasonable price, I snapped it up. I've never enjoyed cooking so much in my life. The copper heats the pot evenly and quickly. It's a dream to keep clean. The lid fits perfectly.The only thing I don't like about this piece is that the weight distribution on the handle is awkward. I have RMI which weakens my wrists and makes lifting and pouring off liquid difficult. A more ergonomic design to the handle would have been better.However the ease of cleanup, the perfect heat conduction, and the outright beauty of the piece make up for any awkwardness. I love it so much I'm asking for the rest of the set for Christmas!"
4,"A decent pot, made in China","Yes, this pot has a solid feel. However, in design and manufacturing standards, it's not on par with All-Clad, or those Cuisinart and Caphalon products that are made in the USA.The weight of this utensil (5 lbs empty, about 11 lbs when filled with 3 quarts of water) paired with the relatively short handle make it slightly awkward in some situations. For example, its size make it ideal for cooking pasta for one or two people, but in that case I would have preferred that the pot have a second (""helper"") handle or at least a longer single handle.As others have noted, both interior and exterior finish are brushed, rather than mirror finish, making it slightly more difficult to clean. However, I disagree that all other finishes look the same after several months. Mirror finishes remain so if a good quality paste copper cleaner is used.On the plus side: The lid of this pot fits well, and the handle of the lid is convenient.Overall, good value, but not 5 star quality."
4,Really Cute Movie,"This movie is very very cute- and pretty well done too! I am a long time fan of garfield cartoons, comics, and the holiday specials. I thought it had a good story-- although some crude humor like a lot of burping etc. but it is funny how they do the animation along with it! If there is anything weird in this movie--- the excellent computer animation makes up for it. Really neat story. Nermal-- one of my favorite characters, is a boy in the movie-- that's well.... different. But an overall very cute and well made movie.-- much better than the garfield movies on the big screen in my opinion."
3,Garfield Gets Real!,"Garfield returns in his first full CGI Movie and it is a disappointment! I like the overall plot of Garfield coming out of the comics and into the real word, but the script is a little slow. Garfield is now voiced by the talented Frank Welker and all the supporting characters resemble their comic strip counterparts unlike the two live movies.The movie isn't great, but I still enjoyed it."
1,Do not bother!,It was really slow as far as action or storyline for parents and for kids. And really not fun to watch.
3,"kids should like it,but it has some pretty freaky looking characters (2.5/5)","i don't quite no what to make of this film.this is Garfield's first CGanimated movie.i thought it had some amusing moments,but nothing laughout loud funny.the story is very simple,so kids will be able to followit very easily.the voices were very fitting for the characters.the CGin general looks nice and pretty.that's the good news.the bad news?someof the characters look quite freaky,almost scary,i think..i also foundthe movie very slow for much of the time.i realise i'm much older thanthe target audience.for kids,if they don't find some of the characterstoo creepy,they will probably enjoy it.adults might like it too,and ifnot,at least they know their kids are watching kid friendlyentertainment.for me,i give Garfield Gets Real a 2.5/5"
1,Cheap,Cheap piece of pine is stained to look like rosewood or some other type of resonant wood. Does not sound good.
5,woodblock,This company is amazing to deal with and the prices are fanstastic. This Hohner Kids Wood Bock with Mallet is fine for adults to use. I belong to a drumming circle and got a larger one for me and got this for my 2 year old grandson who loves to bang on pots and pans...this will be quieter!
4,good block,Not as smooth as I thought it would be and only gets a good tone in a small area but all in all makes a nice sound and easy for little hands to hold.
2,Does not sound good.,"This does not have any cool sound, Its like hitting a 2x4, Very annoying. Dont buy it. Would of gave it 1 star but I could use the stick for something else"
4,Smaller than I expected,"Just a quick heads up....This thing is pretty small. It would be great for a kinder class, but I was expecting something a little more substantial."
1,misleading title,"the product purports to be hardwood. In fact, it is a stained pine block. Since pine is a soft wood, it doesn't have the durability of a true wood block instrument."
3,Nice plot.,"It was odd seeing David Janssen as the pursuer instead of the pursued. I bought this movie because of Janssen, and his days as (the original) Dr. Richard Kimble,, and while I readily admit it was fluff, it was an enjoyable movie. If you remember, and enjoyed him as Kimble, you'll enjoy him in Warning Shot. The men, like me, will also enjoy viewing a young, beautiful Stephanie Powers and Joan Collins."
5,The Life,"Great book,this is my second time owning it. It's very funny and I recommend this book......A must read. Thank You."
2,I'm being generous,"This book falls far short of the intended mark of teaching conduit bending and cable tray systems and its price is certainly way out of line. I was looking for a book that would be beneficial to give as a present to my apprentices as I train them and it will definitely not be this one. Part of the book looks like a parts catalog. I really don't care about knowing the specific part numbers and if I need one that I don't know off hand then I will look at a parts book. There are some beneficial points in this book but they are so basic that you could easily teach them on the job to an apprentice in a day, if it even took that long. Considering price and information available, my recommendation would to be buy the old standard Benfield Bending Guide and use the remainder for lunch."
1,Waste of money,A waste of money! Starts a topic then leaves you dangling. Wish I could leave less than one star.
4,My wife liked this...,"... although I'm not happy with the fact that the description does not mention where the watch's movement was made. Granted, at this price point...The blue mother-of-pearl face is elegant."
2,Pulsar Women's Diamond Collection Watch,Pearl face is too dark. It's hard to see at night. overall it's not pretty as I expected. plus can't read the time.
4,Fully Detailed ?,"My nephew always wanted a coffeetable book on his favorite car the NSX, but couldn't find one. I got him this one and he's totally satisfied with it thinking at first it was just photos until he opened it and noticed how detailed it was. He's big on info and specs and says this book has it all from concept to production of every genation to the future of the NSX. He's a 'debater' type person and now has an informative official book to back-up his bragging debates about the NSX even though it'll be years before he can afford to own one. THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY BOOK OR MY INTREST."
3,"Yeah this is worth 500.00, right?","OK so ya trashed my first review but the question remains, what makes this compilation of magazine articles worth 500.00 on a book originally published for 50.00? Answer me that, censors and redactors!"
4,Great background on the making of the NSX,"I've been a car fanatic since I was 6, so I love books that have great pictures and stories of how a car is made. This one didn't disappoint. I recently bought my first Acura and wanted to dive into the history of the brand and its most storied car. I thought it was a great read and would recommend to Honda/Acura and other car fans alike."
5,Acura NSX book,"The book was in excellent shape and was exactly what I expected. I own an NSX and this is a great discussion of the conception and design of a superb car. Great service, good price. Thanks Amazon."
3,too sweet,"Again, I blend. Must be the Chemistry in me.I use a chai tea bag and add one tablespoon of the big train chai packet."
5,Soothing green tea,"This product is very tasty! I enjoy it so much that I also ordered the Chocolate variety. The Green Tea is so soothing and filling, brings relaxation."
3,3 Pack is misleading,It takes 3 heads to replace all heads on these razors. I bought this thinking a 3 pack meant 3 sets of replacement heads. It is not. For the price I could of bought this elsewhere and saved money.
2,Two Words,"Snooze Fest. Especially coming off the last trilogy of Vulcan internal conflict. The synopsis sounds amazing but don't be tricked as I was. This episode lacked production, had a bad guest actor, the plot points were contrived (Archer would never make that call), and the history lesson was too vague to illicit interest. It had potential but it didn't have enough meat on the bone to make it watchable. I have to recommend people pass on this one."
5,"WOW, No one has mentioned it yet...","Well there is only one reason for writing this review,that is besides the fact that the prison cell they havein the 2150's is an enviable apartment from my point of view.Well now that I have hit the arbitary 20 word minimumfor responces...DATA! IT'S DATA! Yes ladies and gentlementhe only person to shagg Tasha Yar... Brent Spiner."
4,decent!,i tend to find vulcan storylines a little dry. the high command is so uppity and superior. this episode surprised me by being able to hold my interest.
4,Great pickup,"I started watching the first season of Enterprise on DVD and I was hooked. Many retail outlets dont sell them in their stores and Amazon was the best place to get the series. The third season ended in a very climactic fashion and you were left with a cliff hanger come the start of the fourth season. The more you watch the 4th season, the more you realize that UPN made a mistake cancelling this show. The characters were really getting developed as well as story lines that bridged the gap between Archer's era and Kirk's era. The final episode was a little trippy having taken place in the 24th Century on the Enterprise D's holodeck. Just pick up this season..."
4,The Best and Last Season,"By far, season four of Enterprise was its best. Under the writing direction of Manny Coto, the fourth season did a much better job of embracing accepted Star Trek mythology and using it to develop the series. One of the best story arcs was a three-episode run featuring Brent Spiner as Dr. Arik Soong, the ancestor of Commander Data's creator Dr. Noonien Soong. The episodes revolve around a group Khan-esque supermen left over from Eugenics Wars and Soong's attempts to bring several Augment embryos to life. The second great story arc of the season was a three-episode story about the re-embracing of Surak's teachings on Vulcan and featuring the introduction of a young T'Pau. These three episodes allowed Jolene Blalock a great opportunity to really embrace her role. I wasn't a big fan of the final two episodes, but overall this season was their best."
5,Enterprise Fourth Season,I love this TV show. I think that Enterprise was one of the best in the line of Star Trek shows. Scott Bakula is a great captain and the rest of the cast make this show perfect. The show Enterprise answers a lot of questions that were unanswered in Next Generation and makes things a little clearer. I just wished that the show had continued on longer. I really enjoyed this series.
5,Star Trek Enterprise 4th Season,Good product. The crew is loosening up by this season. A bit more sexual content than previous seasons so not as appropriate for younger viewers.
2,Confused,"Honestly, I was confused by this episode and never figured out the point. It shows a mirror universe and that's it... nothing to tie it to the other universe or nothing to show how it ties to the rest of the episodes. I thought it would be like when DS9 had episodes for an alternate universe and they tied together but this wasn't like that at all. It seems like there should have been a Part III to make it all come together and make sense."
2,Choppy and not instant,"The episode was fine, but ""instant"" wasn't instant and was choppy and pixelated. I doubt I will waste money on an ""instant"" episode again. This was a good example of why to buy a DVD or check it out of the library."
1,Worst finale ever.,"I am very disappointed with this finale. Gosh, how I wish the writers would have taken a script from the 'Voyage' finale, pack in some action, give the series finale some life, it totally deserves it and not this mediocre bs of a script. Even 1 star is too generous for this crap."
3,Why so Much!!!,"I liked the series very much.I think it needed something (like maybe a different captain?),but I liked it anyway.My problem is,why so much money for this series.Like twice as much as any other?Why???"
2,You really need to be bold for this one.,"If you bought the rest of the series, you will want see this one as well, if only because you are like me and grew up with ST.The cast of the Enterprise took some getting used to at the begining but by the 4th season we were totally involved with the characters and were emotionally invested in the story line. It is a pity that so many good ideas got wasted and not developed any further in this season.There are excellent performances from extremely good actors like John Billingsley, Jeffrey Combs, John Fleck. It is a pleasure to watch and to listen to them.The last episode was not satisfying in so many ways with characters out of, well, character.In fact, as a family of 4 we decided to imagine a better ending and keep it at that.Watch for the reconstruction of the original series bridge: it is remarkable.Don't have any high expectations from this one but go with the flow and you will have a good time anyway."
1,I can see why this was next to last episode.,"After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series, they ran out of ideas. This one is so, so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception. Whose twisted fantasy is this. Lol. And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show. The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames. This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball."
3,"Ok, but not Great!","We ordered the clippers to continue shaving my sons head at home. There isn't an adjustable blade on this one, so our choices are too short or not short enough. Beard trimmer was great for the hubby!!"
4,Cortadora de Cabello,"Me gusto mucho la presentación de este producto, funciona bien y tiene los implementos minimos para realizar de manera correcta un corte de cabello junto con un buen manual explicativo para principiantes como yo, sin embargo pensé que el sonido de la cortadora iba a ser mas silencioso, pero no fue así."
4,And also GOOD for the price,"Use this on a weekly basis. Holds up well. The trimmer is great for around the ears. Just the right amount of accessories. One minor flaw is the case could be a ""little highe/longer. Just a tad."
1,Its a shame,its a shame that i bought this product thinking that what was promised in the product description was exactly what the customer will get. But i actually gave it away to a friend so he can play with it. The product didnt not met mine expectations i will have to buy another one due to the fact that this product just didnt even work to trim my bear which is a lot to say
1,terrible item,"This was my second Wahl product and I am still disappointed. The first item I had was beard and mustache trimmer I received as a gift. Didn't work, slow speed, didn't cut. That was more than ten years ago so I thought I'd give 'em another try. My mistake. Same problems. I've used Norelco and Conair and they've worked just fine. I recommend those brands, but do not purchase Wahl."
4,Great Product,Great proudct for the price! I have saved the purchase price many times over in home cuts already!
2,To loud to be useful,"I bought this trimmer to trim my dog, but it is so loud as to be unusable. It is loud enough to require someone standing right next to you to yell to be heard. It is louder then my vacuum cleaner and lawn mower. You'd think it would have to be sporting a gas powered 2-cycle engine to be this loud. There is an adjustment screw on the side, but this only helps slightly, and mostly changes the cacophony's proportion of buzzing to rattling.As far as clipping ability: they seem fine, but their usability is largely hampered by the need to wrap multiple bath towels around them to tone down the noise.I bought these a few years ago, tried several times to adjust them or work around the noise, then gave up and put them on a top shelf. I recently saw them sitting there and thought to myself ""they couldn't have been as bad as I remember"". My memories were accurate."
1,CLIPPER THAT PULLS HAIR,"I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son's fast growing hair. He's got thick hair that we like to keep ""buzzed"" short. The first time I used the clippers, he complained that they really pull at the hair. I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed. The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair. I've decided to send it back. Reasonably priced but not worth the pain. NOT RECOMENDED FOR THICK HAIR."
5,Great haircutting combo!,"I am a ""brother"" who has not been to the barbershop for 20 years, because I cut my own hair. Ever since I started doing that, I have only used Wahl clippers, and I have never been disappointed. The price is right for this cutting and trimming set. I use the plug-in clippers for the basic cutting, and the cordless unit for perfecting my Quo Vadis. I highly recommend the set. The smallest guide comb is made of pretty flimsy plastic, but that is my only complaint."
1,useless product,"When I used this clipper, it would stall while trying to cut my hair. The motor and blades would stop moving. Since my hair was only about 3/4 inch long and I was cutting it to 1/4 inch, I don't see any use for this clipper. It cannot perform it's intended purpose. I will be returning it for a refund. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else."
5,Very good set,"Bought it because I'm traveling and I left my older Whal set at home. So far works perfectly fine, just like the other one I've got."
5,Excellent purchase,"I had this machine from a few months ago and is really good. So far I had no problems with it and is a good quality item, once you have all the pieces on the bag it's really practical to travel with it"
3,Sin caja,"No me enviaron como aparece, vino un modelo sin tijera y sin caja para guardar. el estuche es un bolso"
2,ok for price,The trimmew was fine . the clipper was not that good. it pulls if you go too fast. Probably lacks power. Price sometimes makes a differance. Kept it for the trimmer but will continue to use my old clipper
4,one smart toaster,"I love this toaster! This is my second T-Fal toaster and it's a big improvement over the last one. I really like the way it grabs toast and centers it. The shape is fun, creative and looks great in my kitchen (even the lettering matches my red and white decor). While it is true that one side tends to brown more than the other, it is not a substantial difference. You have to be pretty picky about your toast in order to have an issue with this. The stop, reheat, and ""frozen"" buttons are ingenious. The reheat button is especially handly. The price is very reasonable. I don't like the regular plastic toasters and would lean more towards something with more style, like chrome, and end up paying more than double what this one cost. All in all, I thought it was a smart buy."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"At first I was thrilled, thinking I had just purchased the Cadillac of all toasters. However, I was wrong. It only took a couple of weeks for this thing to blow a gasket. The buttons for the reheat and bagel options decided to light up one day and stay on, resulting in burnt toast on one side. For the money, this thing sucks. I find that you can't get a good toaster anywhere, however a $15 one is a better bet than this one. They claim it's much more than they sell it for, but don't know why. I've just resorted to the fact that I will buy a new cheap toaster every couple of years. Maybe I will reinvent the toaster and become a millionaire. It doesn't seem like a very complicated appliance. But nobody can make a good one."
2,"Looks nice, worked fine for about 5 months","I purchased this toaster as a Christmas present for my parents, based on its attractive design and features. Unfortunately, by Memorial Day it was unusable. When one pushes down the lever, it does not ""catch,"" and thus never starts toasting."
4,"Great toaster, but ...","This is my second because I liked the first so much, but the original would not hold the bread down after 5+ years- the clip or something could have probably been bent to fix it, but I found it impossible to get inside. The first one this time around had a loose handle and again could have been easily fixed, but Amazon speedily shipped me a new one which is fine. Too bad that things are being made with fasteners that nobody can open once they're in place."
2,Only one side of bread browned,I bought this toaster and although the features are nice and convenient it only toasted one side of the toast. I tried waffles and bread and each time only one side got brown. I returned it within a week
1,junk the damn toaster,"I purchased this white T-Fal toaster from amazon after reading the rosy reviews. Unfortunately I didn't start using it soon after the delivery as I was busy. Later I opened it and plugged it on, to my disppointment, it wouldn't heat!!. I was not only angry on the manufacturer but also on amazon for shipping this piece of junk!!!!. Please save your money for another brand and do not buy appliances from amazon hereafter."
2,Broken in 9 months,"I really liked my black Avante toaster while it was alive, but it only lasted for 9 months and now refuses to toast anything."
1,poor construction,"It lasted less than six months before completely giving out. Started out with uneven toasting...ok, could live with that. Then, the toast would pop out sporadically. Then, not at all.Finally, wouldn't even stay down when inserting bread/bagel - nothing. That's when we finally gave up on it altogether. Incidentally, only two adults operated it, so it was not handled frequently or roughly. Also, it looks cheap - plastic, not sturdy. Would not recommend."
2,It only looks good,"I bought this toaster because of the looks and unfortunately, that's all it has to offer. The biggest problem is it takes FOREVER to toast. Even when it's ""warmed up"" it takes way too long. It also toasts very unevenly -- part of the toast is dark, other areas are completely white. Also the levers that lets you boost the toast up out of the toaster after it pops up are very cheap and get stuck almost every time you press them down. You have to pull them back into position.I do like the way it looks -- everyone comments on it, but I always respond by saying, ""yes it looks good, but it's the worst toaster I've ever owned."""
1,Possibly the world's worst toaster,"If you've read the other reviews here, you're probably getting the picture: this is a poor product. I agree with all the others: the toasting process is very unpredictable. Sometimes a ""two"" setting will get you perfect toast, sometimes it gets you burnt bread. Sometimes one side will toast, sometimes both. You have to babysit the toasting process at all times. The only good feature is the ""stop"" button and believe me, you will have to use it a lot. Of course, not if you're smart and don't buy this awful thing in the first place!"
3,"Needs refinement and reliability, but overall, still a toaster","Make no mistake, this toaster will toast bread, bagels, english muffins, etc...but why the high price? If my recommendation is based on the toaster alone, then ok, it's a toaster and does its job. But the price to value ratio is out of bounds.The slots are wide, but not too deep. The heating elements are good, but heat unevenly. I can't seem to find the correlation between the number on the dials and the lightness/darkness of the bread/toast. The push lever doesn't seem to do a very good job of lifting the bread out of the slots. The plastic feels cheap. On the plus side, it does look good with the chrome and the push buttons. Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this toaster based on performance, but rather on aesthetics and design. The choice is yours."
4,inexpensive and good quality pants,"These pants are comfortable and well-fitting. Since my son takes Jiu Jitsu, I reinforced the knees with fabric from his older pants that were made of a thicker canvas-type cotton. He has been very happy with them and likes them so much better than his old ones, that always were drooping down or falling down with the odd tie waist"
3,Get what you pay for,"These were very cheap pants, and as the saying goes; you get what you pay for. Everything seems to stick to these pants because of the cheap material. They are sufficient for just a workout, but far from something you would want to wear in a demo or any display!"
1,Poor customer service,"I placed my order and it was shipped on time however, UPS left it on my doorstep and someone took it. I contacted the seller, a week went by and I received no reply, so I filed a claim. After filling the claim, the seller contacted me and said they just received my email. They told me that if I dropped the claim, they would reship my order via US mail so it wouldnt be left on my doorstep again. I agreed and dropped the claim. A month went by, I never received my order and the seller never replied to any attempt I made at contacting them."
3,martial arts pants,Quality of the material is not what I expected. They seem too crisp even after several washes.
2,Way too new-agey for my tastes,"Look, it's jerking off without release. I'm not sure what mushrooms these guys are on, but nothing in the DVD makes me ""see colors"" when my ""gateway to my consciousness"" is being stroked. It's a couple of average naked dudes touching each other's meat like they were at a 5th grade bible camp."
1,No reason to buy this DVD.,"I found this a total waste of time and money. The examples shown were extremely repetitive and limited. The techniques for couples were exactly the same as the techniques for a solo. The entire DVD was more about breathing together as a couple and the extreme basics of body massage. It was supposed to be transcendental but only mentions a few points of yoga. It never explains chakras and for that mater actually NEVER EXPLAINS anything at all, it just presents one or two basic touch techniques. This DVD is slow paced, boring and shows nothing new ."
1,"Warning: blade frames WILL rust, wicker disintegrates","Nice looking fan. Installed it in a guest bedroom in a waterfront residence in the US Virgin Islands. Figured it was just the ticket. Wrong! Four years later the metal frames of the fan blades have rusted and the wicker is disintegrating such that the fan has literally sprayed our white walls with rust particles now requiring new paint to cover.This fan was rarely used and remained in a room that was generally closed to the sea air. Don't even think of placing it in an area with ""Caribbean breezes"". Replacing the original blades is no option since they cost a much as new fan. I've subbed classic wood blades for the originals.I note that Hunter now has a similar model with plastic blades simulating the wicker effect. No big surprise there."
4,Nice piece for a nice price,"I really like my fan. Our walls are more like a creamish color, the fan has a little pinkish shine to it. I tought it would be more creamish. But i am still happy that i got it. Good price."
1,Don't expose this fan to a Caribbean breeze,"Nice looking fan. Installed it in a guest bedroom in a waterfront residence in the US Virgin Islands. Figured it was just the ticket. Wrong!

3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this fan planning to mount it outdoors. Amazon states it can be mounted outdoors but on arrival it is clear that it is intended only for indoor use, it does not have a damp rating. When I unpacked the fan, I discovered that the lamp fixture was rusted. I followed instructions and called Hunter who said they would ship me a new light fixture; when it arrived they had only shipped the glass globe. I painted the rusty lamp and mounted the fan in my family room where it looks and performs very well; otherwise I would have given it a one star rating."
2,what a mess,"When paying full price for a book, I expect that it will be in new condition. This book arrived with more than half of the pages destroyed. It went staight to the trash and I will never buy from this seller again!"
1,Confusing,"I've bought this produt thinking it was for the new ipod with video.it's not easy to know to what kind of ipod is.My friend just bought the same thing in a regular store and i decided to buy the same, that's why i tried to buy this.Says case for Ipod 5g w/ video.first of all i don't know a ipod with 5g i tought was a mistake.then a returned the item, like 15 days ago and i didn't receive my refund yet.that's why i'm saying this"
3,Cool Effect... Not for Protection,"After looking into almost every case on the market, I decide to buy this case.Pos: Looks cools, you will get wows from people you show it to. Due to the shape of the case (see con) it docks easily, even to iTrip. Case is attached securely but still comes off when you want it to. Has two back covers for 30GB and 60GB, 80GB.Con: If you want to protect your iPod, do not buy. This cheap plastic shell covers the front and back of your iPod but leaves the scroll wheel completely exposed, as well as the bottom connection port. If you drop your iPod, it was receive the same damage if there was no case. The mirror effect darkens the screen, so turn up the brightness (drain the battery) to watch movies. Griffin claims the back cover is ""rubberized"", but it is still slippery. It scratches as easily as the iPod itself (mine came pre-scratched for my convenience). For what you get, they should have knocked $10 from the price."
1,See it before you buy.,"I ordered this for an apple ipod video 5g. I have one for a new ipod nano and it is beautiful. The first one arrived with scuffs on it. They couldn't be removed. When I looked at the packaging, the same scuffs were on the packaging. It appeared that the packaging had rubbed on the screen, damaging it. I returned it easily to amazon, which promptly sent out a replacement, even before they received my product back. Sadly, the replacement had the exact same problem. I returned it, too and looked locally. I found one left locally. I looked at it and sure enough, it, too, was scuffed. Griffin has changed the packaging on the later versions (for the nano, etc) of this item and the new packaging seems to protect the screen just fine. If you can find one of these undamaged, they seem to hold up well, but getting a good one might be tough."
1,Don't Bother: Poor quality and not as advertised!,"When my item arrived the screen was scratched, but besides that the picture didn't ""shine through as if by magic"". It was difficult to view videos because the screen was so dark and it was so reflective all you saw was your face shining back at you. Even if it was free it would not be a good case. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
3,Scratches,I have returned one and received a 2nd. There were still scratches on the item inside the packaging.
2,Looks cool on the web site but not functional in real life.,"Pros: Looks cool at first glance, easy to remove cover.Cons: Difficult to watch videos, impossible to see anything in sunlight. My case already had a large scuff in the middle. Doesn't protect click wheel.I'd recommend getting the Belkin Brushed Metal case over this one."
3,"Good, but could be better","I bought this product based upon the wow factor. When I got it, i put it on my ipod nano. I was very excited, but that feeling soon left.Pros: Looks cool, and people are amazedprotects the screenCons:In direct sunlight, you can see through the ""metal"", so it is like a cheap regular case.The case darkens the pretty screenscratches very easily and shows.Overall, i would go with a nice flip leather case.1 + 2 stars for wow factor3 stars for the protection of the screen"
4,Its a case that few have ever seen....,"I will admit this case draws lots of attention to your ipod. I can't say that I have seen anything else quite like it. The case does make the ipod a bit larger, so if your going for stealth this probably won't work. I have dropped my ipod a few times and the Griffin Reflect has saved it from sure death. The chrome screen is very sweet. I have the 5.5 Gen iPod, and the case required me to turn up the brightness in order to see it at full tilt. The only down fall to the case is the chrome finish is a bit fragile. I still rated it 4 stars because I expected there to be some scratching and flaking of the chrome finish. However depsite its fragile nature the case has really endured quite well. I have a couple pixel size spots on the chrome over the screen area. So far so good. Enjoy!"
4,Good Value,"This case is very simple to put on and remove. It gives the iPod a nice, sleek look while keeping the entire thing protected. The only issue with it is that it increases the thickness of the iPod and will not it allow it to fit into some docks forcing you to remove the case each time you want to use that specific dock. Other than that, great product."
2,Wasn't what I've expected,"First of all, the back of the product is black, it doesn't appear at the picture and the front of the case isn't as pretty as it appear in the picture."
2,Scratched,"Mine too was scratched out of the box. I wouldn't really care except it's scratched right where the screen is and is fairly large. I bought it simply to put in a Bose Sounddock because I didn't like the fact that the screen was exposed. It looks really sharp there (minus the scratch)Has anyone got a non-scratched one? (ie, is it even worth trying to replace it.)"
2,Problems,I thought that this case was going to be actual chrome--but is plastic. I was unable to see the screen unless I turned it on. I was unable to see the screen when I was outside--it was too dark. The corner cracked the first time I attempted to put the case on. The case would not fit over my ipod thin clear plastic covers. I suggest not to buy this product.
2,Coonts' brother-in-law,I bought and read this on the stength of Coonts' remark on the cover. After reading the book I figure Rovin must be his brother-in-law or something. If you can suspend your belief in the laws of physics you may like this book. Previous negative reviewers have made a point of commenting on the silliness of the tech and the 'military' conversations. The outright ignorance of naming conventions for ships and shooting off an RPG or even TOWs at an aircraft the shooter is hoping is traveling above the speed of sound is too much to take. The facts would have been so easy to check. Rovin is too sloppy to support. I won't be buying in more of his 'work'.
5,What a great read!,"I used to read Tom Clancy novels around his Cardinal in the Kremlin book era, and I stopped reading his books when he began doing the joint book efforts. I was looking for a selection of new authors to read at the beach, so I picked up Rogue Angel. It was a wonderful book to read; I was totally engrossed in the story.I enjoyed that his characters weren't perfect in every way - it made them much more believable, and I appreciated the patriotism that both the military and civilian characters displayed.It's a great book, and now I'm looking forward to reading other Jeff Rovin books!"
5,great outdor rug,"I HAVE HAD THIS MAT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL, I PUT A CABANA OUTSIDE MY BACK DOR AND THE MAT COVERS ENOUGH SPACE TO PUT CHAIRS AND STOOLS ON TOP, IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER ROOM EXTENSION."
5,This tape is so uplifting!,"Not only is this tape uplifting but you can just feel the spirit of the Lord flow through this CD. The songs are wonderfully written, the music is super skillfully played, and the choir sings under the annointing and with power. The title track, ""I Surrender All"", WOW! It is hard not to let yourself be caught up....."
3,Not for CAPM test takers,"If you are preparing for the CAPM exam, then this book is not for you. The CAPM *ONLY* covers the material in the PMBOK 3rd edition. This book covers other theories, definitions, and math equations. You will waste your time studying some of the material here and not cover the PMBOK material enough. I recommend to read the PMBOK 2 or 3 times and also buy the Q&A's for the PMBOK 3rd edtion. Perhaps the PMP test is different."
5,Love Chris Knight.,"Another great one from Chris Knight, I love this guy, raw, real music. You believe he lived every word he sings."
3,A Pretty Good Album?,"I'll start out by saying that Christ Knight's 1998 self-titled debut album is one of the best ""alternative country"" albums ever. Knight has an awsome gravelly voice, and his lyrics are reminiscent of a rural Bruce Springsteen. In fact, on ""Pretty Good Guy,"" he elevates the lyrical content to the point where the songs play like a collection of down and out short stories, several of which take disturbing turns with their violence and mayhem. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of the catchy hooks and choruses that make the first album such a masterpiece. The sound of this album is much less polished, which is more befitting of Knight's voice, but the grooves just aren't there. Like with his debut, Knight's sound skirts the border between country and folk, though on this album the songs tend to be slower.If lyrics are more important to you than the music that supports them, then this is the album for you. Otherwise, I recommend taking a pass."
5,Great follow-up album,"Chris Knight's CD ""A Pretty Good Guy"" has a raw, gritty feel to it that echoes strongly of fellow Nashville outcast Steve Earle. Knight's amazing songwriting skills and captivating lyrics don't hint around a subject like other story song singers. He goes right for the jugular of the message he is sending. This is why he is so popular among a fringe group of country music fans. Unlike his first CD, ""A Pretty Good Guy"" has more passionate and personal lyrics that speak about more than just people' misfortune. They are much more encouraging than previously (except for a couple of songs). Chris Knight would be secured as one of the best songwriters in country music if the industry was not so leary of his take on music. This is a great CD. If you like listening to music with a message, Chris Knight is a singer you should give a chance."
3,Simple and Clean,Purchased the Spartan for my son because it is simple and clean (good first knife). Would like to see the philips screwdriver blade in-lieu of cork screw though.
5,Best knife for traveling/camping,"Over the years, I have bought about 10-15 of this same model (some I lost, some were gifts). It has everything that a reasonable person would want. I use the standard red colour myself. However, there are three others in my family unit, so I bought them a black one, a translucent blue, and a translucent red. (Other than the outside plastic, they are functionally all the same.) The main knife blade is very sharp, and does not dull quickly."
5,Stay simple,"Jack Leonard's story is mine too - I've carried this precise model knife since my parents brought me one from Europe in about 1964. I am probably on my 9th or 10th one. This knife is optimal - enough blades but not so many that you list as you walk. (And, yes, one blade sharp and the other abused.) I am re-ordering this model even though I'm carrying a backup model that is identical except for swapping out the corkscrew for a phillips screwdriver. That's not good enough - you can improvise the phillips but not a corkscrew!"
3,It's ok,"I found this book difficult reading. It is choppy in the way that it goes from the author writing, to old newspaper articles that you are reading from. I would have preferred to just hear it told by the author. It got repetitive because there are a few different articles in each chapter about the same kind of creature, so you are basically reading the same info 2 or 3 times each chapter."
4,A must read for all would-be Managers,"Working for the world leading consulting firm, I was advised by my Manager during my last performance evaluation review to work at the improvement of my Leadership skill ... but he didn't clearly specified what he meant by that or how I could achieve that goal.On a business trip in the US, I was lucky to discover that ""Leadership isn't something you're born with. It's something you learn by reading Dogbert books"".I'm now reading and training hard, having discovered that in my ""Dilbert's principle""-managed Company, Dogbert's advices are the only thing able to propel me at a management position :-)"
5,It all makes sense now,"After spending the last year and a half working at four verydifferent jobs for four very different ""in-duh-viduals,"" thisbook somehow managed to clarify exactly what is going on ina boss's mind. All those seemingly random last-minutedecisions, all those bizarre comments about synergies andemployee empowerment, it's all a plot by stupid bosseseverywhere. Read the book, yes. Understand what motivatesevil bosses everywhere, perhaps. Try to emulate, I think not."
2,The downward spiral continues (More Management for Dummies),"Dogbert relates how to become the perfect incompetent manager. Similar to the Dilbert Principle where the incompetent manager is described. Not nearly as funny or fresh as the Dilbert Principle, which in turn pales in comparison to the comics. More stupid {management policies}/managers interspersed with some genuinely funny strips. Fairly short, and really, not worth the money. This is a disturbing trend for a deservedly popular comic strip, and I shudder to think of the next in this line of pseudo-novels (Catbert's Guide to HR, Ratbert's Guide to Incompetence?). An impassioned plea to Scott Adams: stick to comics and the DNRC newsletter, long spates of writing aren't your forte. Not recommended"
4,The Dilbert Attitude,"If you've ever been in the hi-tech rat race, you already know that the Dilbert comic strip is a documentary. You may also have started to wonder how all the pointy-hairs came to hold such similar sets of bizarre beliefs. Well, your worst fears have come true. There is a secret cabal of pointy-haired teaching, and this is its text.About half of the book's volume is reprints of Dilbert comics showing the eerie illogic of the pointy-hairs. Those are interleaved with cynical advice to the would-be boss. Topics include motivating without actual reward, ignoring the conflicts between inane wishes and physical laws, and creating a workplace free from any risk of productivity.Adams's cynicism is good for a few laughs, and certainly voices the nerd's-eye view of workplace foolishness. A lttle goes a long way, though, and his later books tend to drive the joke into the ground.//wiredweird"
3,Seen lot of this elsewhere,"Although a great fan of Scott Adams & dilbert, I have seen too much of this in the daily papers & ""the dilbert principle"" - a much better book"
4,"Funny, I didn't realize I worked with Dilbert","So I bought this book because I was having one of ""those"" weeks at work and thought well what a pick-me-up. Low and behold, I started reading this and realized that Dogbert must have been using my work as his model! LOL. I finally understand why I can't get anywhere at work, I'm applying logic! Anyway, it's a great laugh and worth the price, as always if you like Dilbert, you'll love Dogbert. I also love the evil Catbert, but I'm afraid he'll steal my soul. Enjoy"
4,Early book on criminology and forensics,"""Following 'The Century of the Detective,' Thorwald carries his engrossing story of Science versus Crime into new fields. The first part of the book highlights the use of increasingly refined tests of blood and other body secretions in detection work. The second part centers on the detection of clues contained in the so-called microtraces, such as dust, fiber fragments, plant particles, sand, earth, crumbs, hair."""
3,beware of tape pulls or skips,"First the bad news - in symphony # 97 and to a lesser degree # 98 there are the equivalent of skips (as if some of these were recorded on 78s) and repeated notes. I am not familiar with the original LP pressings which very likely had the same defects. To some extent this ruins the enjoyment of some of the most remarkable Haydn recordings ever. For the 12 London, my favorite is till the Beecham set. For those who don't notice (the defects are hardly noticable), buy with confidence and enjoy. For those who don't notice the defects, these are five star recordings."
3,flatware set,I was disappointed in the quality of the flatware. It started to rust in spots when I washed them in my dishwasher. I now have chosen to hand wash them which is not a happy alternative.
1,Worthless,"According to the instructions, the batteries should last between 11 and 16 hours. My first set of good batteries were worn out after 4 hours. The second set of batteries were gone after 40 minutes. It is absurd for the manufacturer to say that there is something magical about their own batteries. The good thing is that Amazon quickly refunded my money."
3,Beware of Product Description...No Radio!,"Let me first say that the product description is wrong. There is no AM/FM radio... just the CD player! Regarding the CD player, I was expecting more bass control besides the 3 options and although I don't like loud banging bass sounds, this wasn't close to my expectations. I wasn't crazy about the audio output from the ear phones either. I will try another set and see if it's better. I guess I shouldn't be complaining with this product due the very fact that in 2011 I'm buying a Walkman. But having said that, for what it's supposed to do, I wasn't impressed and would not recommend as well as being overpriced!Review update: After a couple hours of use, the right speaker blew out. I guess it couldn't handle all that Bass!"
3,players works fine but problems with car adapter,"The CD player works well and does not skip, but I had to send the car adapter cassette back to SOny to be replaced because it kept popping out. The new one seems to work."
5,great,"Sony DEJO17CK WALKMAN PORTABLE CD PLAYER W/CAR ACCESSORIES, I use this all the time and now they are hard to find in stores, so I went online and bought several. I listen to books on CD's during the day."
2,Cd Player,The product is of poor quality it skips constanly.I would not recommend this product to any one.I thought it was my cd's a first but I have tried several brand new cd's with the same problem.
4,Expected more of the buttons,"This is a solid CD player. When listening in the dark, I found the volume up button really hard to find. Sometimes I can't sleep, so I listen to music in the dark. I have had the silver version previously, and found the buttons a little easier to identify in darkness. The batteries are installed underneath where the CD is inserted. At first I thought that was strange, but after many hours of use, I found the exterior to be cleaner looking. I would recomend the Energizer Lithium long life batteries if you listen to music very much. Also consider some high quality head phones."
4,Decent price for an Old Fashioned Walkman,"I doubt these things are selling like hotcakes these days even though they look like pancakes. For my purpose, this worked perfectly. I bought this for a football BBQ tailgate party to attach to a sony boombox. The cd player on the boombox had started skipping and this seemed like a resonable fix instead of buying another full priced box. I always record a mix cd of all the punk, alternative and classic rock songs that I enjoy and it makes for a great time with the beer, hamburgers and hot dogs. This little walkman does the trick, doesn't skip, and made my BBQ a success...or maybe that was just the beer...who knows? All I know is that I'm happy with it."
5,Perfection,Item is perfection on earth. Item was received on time. I'll certainly purchase again from DataVision in the future. Outstanding value!
4,Works well,"I like it. Sounds good and remembers where it was on a recording if I turn it off for a few days.I wish it had a belt clip, but it fits well in a fanny pack."
1,The most important feature wasn't true,"The very first item on this list of features is ""Cd-R/Rw Playback"" and that, plus the Sony name, was the main reason I spent the extra money for this player. Unfortunately it has proven very finicky about which home-burned CD-Rs it will play. If that feature wasn't the first one listed, implying it is its strongest suit, and if it weren't so relatively expensive, I would award more stars, but I feel like I have to send a message to other buyers: YOU CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY COUNT ON THE Sony NAME."
1,Never worked,"This product looked great and came with a lot of accessories, however, no matter how long the unit charged or how many new batteries were used, the product never worked. The CD just spins around, soundless. The volume does not work nor do the track buttons. Do not waste your money on this product."
4,Ok little player,"It's an OK player-very nice sound I think. Buttons are not so user friendly. Too small and closely spaced. I don't use it outside the home, but I wouldn't want to have to locate all the buttons by touch while driving. My Panasonic of 9 years was better all around-it just died. So this one's OK for my use-worth the money . In the end it's all junk from China. I bet this won't last 9 years. What suckers we are in America to feed cheap products from China.Allison"
1,Terrible Sound Quality with Cassette Adapter,"I got this to use in my car with the cassette tape deck adapter. I have to turn the CD volume to maximum and then turn the tape deck up to about 75% to hear a reasonable sound level. Then if I forget to turn the cassette volume down, the radio sound level is Way too high when I eject the tape adapter.Perhaps all CD players are like this, this is the only I've had any experience with."
1,CD player sucks,It says that it can play CD-R/RW but the R/RW has to be Audio meaning you can have a lot of tracks on one CD. I bought mine at Best Buy thinking I could replace my old CD player which skips tracks. When I could play it and have no sound I contacted Sony about the problem and they told me that it can play CD-R/RW if only it's Audio. That was a waste of my money buying this stupid thing when all my CDR/RW's are MP3's. I'll make sure the next CD player I buy is able to play CD-R/RW.
4,good head banging music,"Somewhere between thrash and avant-garde jazz, Zu creates some very compelling music. Not for you if you are of the faint of heart... otherwise dig in for a great ride."
2,"Cute, but frustrating","My daughter loves her Chou Chou doll and was so excited to get this outfit for her ""baby."" The overalls are very cute, but have a major design flaw: The fake snaps on the shoulders actually get in the way of the velcro underneath, so that the shoulder straps simply won't stay fastened. The doll is constantly falling out of the overalls and I am constantly re-dressing her. It's terribly frustrating for my daughter, and I'm planning to buy a couple of real snaps and fix the darn thing myself. I caution anyone else against buying this outfit when there are so many other cute clothes available for the Chou Chou doll."
3,Part of Mexican Pop Culture,"Mexican cartoon El Chichicuilote was created in the late '80s, getting involved in the children's music scene soon after. In 2001, 12 Chichicuilotazos con Banda reached Billboard's Latin Top 50, becoming the most popular Mexican character singing traditional and popular songs. ~ Drago Bonacich, All Music Guide"
3,Brief and Mediocre Overview of Worship,"This book is more of a ""light reading"" title for a person who just wants a quick summary of the importance of Christian worship. There are no detailed instructions or intense discussions of current topics, just the authors' thoughts on the need for a renewed emphasis on worship. I read this book because it was included with a worship kit I purchased. It's not bad, but I doubt if I would have purchased it alone."
5,Shepard Avenue,"Little did I know that when I picked this book for my Kindle Fire, that I would be spellbound. It was everything I want in a book and held me captive until the end. A wonderful read!"
5,I loved this book!!!,"I've been downloading many free books lately on my kindle, and this is the first one I would have definitely purchased. I am an avid reader of just about anything, but romance, usually reading at least three books at a time, and I am still thinking of these characters three days after finishing. This would make a great movie. I will definitely be checking out this authors other work. You will not be disappointed in this read."
2,"""Shepherd Avenue"" Disappoints","I was disappointed that ""Shepherd Avenue"" did not meet my expectations of Charlie Carillo's work based on my having greatly enjoyed his four other novels. I understand that this book was the author's first effort and I am glad that he did not give up after this one. The characters are not developed as fully as in the other novels and the story is exceedingly depressing with an ending that leaves one hanging."
4,"Good book, but sometimes sad","This story of a young lad dropped off at his grandparents in Brooklyn, NY after the death of his mother and his father's desertion, is not always a happy read. I loved Joey's spunk and ability to survive in a dysfunctional, often cold environment. You will not like his grandmother, but his grandfather makes up for it. I felt such empathy towards Joey due to the cold, cruel people thrust into his life. He is a survivor, but sadly, did it have to be so hard? Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the book despite all of the hypens. Someone please edit this book and reissue it."
4,Shepherd Avenue,This was well written and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The author's concise and yet descriptive prose takes the reader through the emotive story of a young boy abandoned by his father following the death of the boy's mother. He is taken in by his grandparents and forced to adapt to a lifestyle and neighbourhood he is completely unfamiliar with. A very good read.
4,Very touching story,I enjoyed this alot. A young man comes to realize that being a man doesn't mean ignoring feelings or isolating himself from them. And the bigger lesson - Grandpas are people too. Well worth a read.
5,"Wouldn't be without it, after 20 years!","I fell in love with this product 20 years ago when I worked for Shiseido. The bristle tips are rounded, unlike most cleansing brushes, so there is no abrasive feel (or effect) on the skin. However, the brush helps to thoroughly clean, gently exfoliate, and massages the skin. The overall effect is clean, smooth, and vibrant. I've only had to replace my brush twice in those 20 years, so though they're expensive, they're also long-lasting."
5,Shiseido Brush,"With super sensitive skin, I was looking for a cleansing brush that would remove my makeup without making my face burn. This brush is perfect. It is soft on the complexion but firm enough to remove all traces of makeup. Great purchase for anyone who must be careful what they use on their face. Seller was excellent and I received the brush shortly after ordering."
3,"Feels nice, but doesn't do much","I've only used this a few times when I was searching for an alternative to the Clarisonic. It feels great on your skin, but I'm just not sure it does anything for my skin. There was absolutely no change in my complexion or softness."
4,Great Facila Brush,I've been using these brushes since I was 17. They are great and have always helped me keep my skin looking good. It's amazing how much more dirt and makeup comes off with the use of this brush vs just your hands. I have since moved to the Clarsonic but I still take this with me when I travel.
2,Beware,"The product is as described in some respects. The colors do not have the same appearance in person, as pictured on line. The organge really appears as individual red and yellow fibers. It was way too colorful. I ordered through a secondary seller on Amazon and so could not find an alternative rug to reorder. the return shipping cost was almost as much as the cost of the rug. So, I am I still trying to sell it myself. Beware of the appearance and the returnability."
5,Great kickboxing DVD,Not really for beginners though. And don't be fooled like me because I actually bought this one thinking it was different than the one I got a few years ago with a different cover....it wasn't. Still love the DVD though.
5,Wow!! Like Clancy but BETTER!!!,"This book rocked!! I got it from a friend of mine and had to buy my own copy! The action sequences alone are worth the price! This book has everything, Action, espionage, jets, cars, women, and music. And it's funny, too!! Like the Tom Clancy books, but it doesn't go into the political stuff, so it's even BETTER!!! Starts off a little slow, but when it picks up....hold on!! And the author says there's ANOTHER ONE? And what's the ELITE EAGLES mentioned on the copyright page? BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
3,Cute,"Its a cute dress,but runs very small,I ordered a size up and its too small for me.Gonna put it in my yard sale."
5,I Love it!!!,"I own this product and I love it!! It is so fun. It works well and it is a great conversation piece whenever my friends are out on the water with me. I paid a little more than you can find on here sorry to say, but it was still well worth it! 5 Stars all around!!!"
1,Save yourself the aggravation - DON'T buy this product,Unfortunately I bought this camera elsewhere also and payed much more for mine. There is a reason that they have LOWERED their prices (to meet there LOW Quality!!) This camera has serious wiring issues - too many connections to get fowled. I only owned it one year and it has been sent to the shop twice (in the shop more than on the boat)- and is still there. The service is ABOMINABLE - they currently can't locate the camera that I shipped them in August (now December) - despite having USPS confirmation and assigned repair number. (The two people with whom I have had contact in regards to the problems have also been very rude!)I would highly recommend looking into the Sea Viewer camera line before wasting your money on this JUNK !!
2,Heavenly scents but Very disappointed.,Shipped on time. Packed in cut up then taped together boxes. Perfume leaked in perfume box discoloring the cloth interior. The gold and black bottles are opaque so you can't tell how much leaked out. I was surprised the bottles were larger than what I expected. All of the scents are heavenly but don't last very long. I was very disappointed and expected a better product considering the price. Especially in duration of the scent.
4,Sharks by Andew Cleave,"This is one of the most best illstrated books i've ever read. The detail of the photos makes it a great book, if you like to look at the pictures. There is plenty of information and lots of interesting facts. For someone who wants to get a close look down a throat of a Great White this book has the photos for you. I highly recomend this book for people with sharks on the brain."
1,Slowest shipping ever!,"Not only was the poster a tad bit bigger then the advertised size (which makes in look wrinkled in a frame), but they took FOREVER to ship it! It came wayyyyyy after the estimated delivery date due to them shipping it late. I would NEVER order with this seller again!"
5,A Quiet Relaxing Visionary Ethereal Sound,"This CD is a must have for all those who love soft, beautifully created ethereal sound. You can listed to five minutes of track two on What's Up on Planet Earth dot com. The sound is truly Heavenly and majestic. I listen to this ALL the time. You can write, heal, or lie awake envisioning with it."
4,highly readable,William Dunham's book never fails to entertain or enlighten. His sense of humor is sharp and his writing is style is crisp whether he is guiding the reader through a proof or commenting on the absentmindedness of mathematicans. (I cracked a few smiles over the mathematical personality chapter.)
2,Too Much Rhetoric,"I had to read this book for calculus, and it was hard for me to get through a chapter without cringing at Dunham's rhetoric that he is constantly using. In an academic writing (and in a mathematics book no less) I would like to see a lot more objectiveness. Dunham forms biases and writes accordingly; for example, he absolutely fawns over Euler yet can only mention a fraction of Newton's accomplishments. Please Professor Dunham - when writing about logic, write more logically!"
4,Amusing Non-Technical Book,An amusing non-Technical book for laymen. Covers the history of math and the many colorful personalities involved in creating it. Has an error using a complex integral.
3,"Good, but lacking in depth","Although I enjoyed this book, particularly the historical accounts of mathematical figures, I was disappointed with the lack of mathematical depth with which the subjects were treated. If you want an equally good book with more depth buy Journey Through Genius by the same author."
4,"Fun, easy read for those with some college/high school calculus","This was a very fun read! It brings you through 2000+ years of mathematics and demonstrates some brilliant mathematical reasoning, e.g. Archimedes, Euler, etc... The chapters are broken up into very small and digestable sizes. Dunham did a great job! Buy now and have fun!"
4,Watercolor 2,A very good guide for learning watercolor painting as a hobby. Would suggest viewing the Simply Painting Introduction to Watercolors. The two DVDs provide an excellent introduction to hobby painting.
2,Book Review,"This is a great book for some who is more into the theory and not applications in digital filters. The examples are simplistic. If you are looking for a book in practical applications, this is not the book for you."
5,Good for developing insight into dsp fundamentals,"Some years ago(!) Hamming held a seminar/workshop which I attended. This book was the handout. As I remember, he said that this book was a result of teaching students at the Naval Post Graduate School where he found that the students were smart/bright/quick, but just rusty on their math. As a result, the book is not intended for the same audience as Oppenheim and Schaffer.One item that appears to be unique is Hamming's short piece on differentiating filters (the noise increases with frequency when the signal is differentiated, and practical application typically is not interested in the higher frequencies).This is not a cookbook for implementing digital filters. It is a good book for developing insight into the math and development of the basic dsp filter. I still pull it out to look up something, from time-to-time."
3,A romance writer and a dude--just the right stuff.,"Michelle Garrison is a romance writer facing her greatest challenge, an editor who thinks her work is stale. Grudgingly, Michelle leaves New York for a western dude ranch sojourn straight out of the worst western romance. Tag Martin is a rancher being forced by his grandmother to marry in order to keep his ranch. At the last minute, the friend he planned to marry in a fake ceremony elopes and arranges for him to marry a complete stranger. When his friend and ranch hand finds a woman wandering along the road, he assumes the woman is the bride-to-be. The woman, however, has no clue as to her identity but agrees to marry Tag to help him. As the newlyweds work the ranch together, feelings begin to grow and flourish despite the lies and misconceptions threatening to tear them apart. The developing relationship between Tag and Michelle is the saving grace of this book. They are likeable despite the trials and tribulations they must suffer."
5,Not from China,I'm sick of hearing about all the poison the chinese put in dog food so as to make a buck. It was truly refreshing to find a product that contains nothing from CHina and the dog loves it and it's good for him. What a deal!!
5,Special treats!,"Before our new pup arrived I bought toys, grooming aids, cleaning products, bags of food and a variety of treats that are bite-size and on the soft side. Callie likes these Chicken and Venison Jerky Treats so I use them as ""special"" treats for special behavior and cut them up so they are tinier. I would certainly add these treats to my ""must have"" list for Callie."
5,You Must Buy This Book,"You must buy this book if you want to find out how movies work, i.e., how they enrich our cultural experience and how they are made. Kawin's textbook is pleasantly readable by anyone interested in the cinema. It contains a wealth of information from film appreciation to film production (including explanations of various special effects!) to film studies. Every aspect of the cinema is clearly explained and illustrated with examples, and the book contains many still photographs, 96 of which are in color.I think this is exactly how a ""how-to"" book should be written. I only wish it had been updated to reflect advances in the 1990s -- this book was first published in 1987 and reprinted in 1992."
3,how movies work,"I had to buy this book for a filmmaking class. It was okay but I felt that the book was a little dated and that it could have been better if more diagrams were used. Also, some of the principles behind film, such as continuity editing and filming, wasn't explained that well. My teacher had to assign us additional material explaining the principle better. This was the case with several important principles on filmmaking. It would also be nice if a CD was included with short clips on films explaining different aspects of filmmaking."
4,Fun,I love ordering from Amazon I have recently purchased another product. The game is exactly what my son wanted.
4,Good game,"fun game play, fairly good storyline, fast shipping, short game. this game was delivered on aug. 18, i'm very close to finishing it and its the 30th. pretty fast shipping for super saver, it was purchased on aug. 11 and came on the 18."
3,"If you like arena battles, you're all set.","I am really disappointed with this game (and I loved the other Ratchet & Clank games). This game just moves from one arena battle to the next (in the form of very small planets), so you don't get the adventures you do with the previous games. There is a cooperative mode where two players can play, but you need a big tv because it's like watching a couple of microbes run around."
4,iz fun but...,"it dosent have along enough adventure... but im not sayin it sucks. I like bast things alot. In fact those kind of games are the only kind I buy ever ever (besides combat raceing).But next time make it harder and longer(and a little less guns).And I am very very fond of the co-op mode but have clank use the wepens you already bought and use the commands and have a weapens called the electro blade i mean make 12 year old in nead of freind, who needs to know that his voice counts. : [ (please)..."
3,It is OK,Not what I was Expecting. Not made by the same People who make the first Ratchet and Clank.And in Good Condition.
4,Great,"This game is different than the other R&C games, but that's okay. Why? Well, because it's a good game, and a good addition to the R&C series! It focuses more on combat and less on platforming, but I really see no problem with that at all. Some of the controls may seem a bit funky, but you can adjust the controls so no real problem there. I would'v liked to have Clank with me like in the other games, but as I went along I didn't really think of Clank that much. Just kind of a momentary thought. This really is a good game, and I would recommend it. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,"Good, but please give us more of a story and more Clank next time!","I like Ratchet & Clank and I've got all four of the PSII games.They're fun, funny, engaging, clever, witty, amusing, challenging and interesting.This new game looks fantastic and the weapons are great.The challenges are interesting, but I miss:1. A good story.2. Clank, who is only a minor character in this one.3. Captain Quark, who has been developing into of R&C;'s most loveable and amusing characters.4. A good story.This current game has some excellent qualities but for a player with a normal TV and no broadband/cable internet connection it is pale in comparison to the other R&C; games.Please, please, please bring back the Ratchet & Clank of old - defending the galaxy and blowing up stuff and providing us with plenty of laughs along the way. Captain Quark is one of the best characters in the series, too, as well as Al, Helga and Skid."
3,"Unwelcome changes, but still a decent ride","Sooner or later, the creators of the Ratchet & Clank series were bound to try a few new things. This is one of those changes which didn't work well in the innovation department. If you've never experienced a Ratchet game, you'll likely enjoy this much more than veteran players, simply because the mechanics we've grown so used to have been altered here. And it doesn't feel as intuitive as the other game controls are. But when you whittle the gripes away, it's still Ratchet doing his thing. And that's always some good times."
2,Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry Disappointing,"No ressemblance of the Ratchet & Clank games 1 thru 3. It's a great game with great graphics if all your into is short progressive battle challenges. I own and played the first three series. I COULDN'T WAIT for DEADLOCKED to come out......I counted the months. The first day it came out I purchased it. It took me only 20 hours to complete it whereas it took me 40-60 hours for R&C games 1 thru 3 at an equal level of challenge. Again, if your into battle challenges, get it....if you think your getting a R&C 1 thru 3 parity game you'll truly be disappointed. I'm still bummed."
1,NEVER ORDERED THIS CRAP!!!!!,SOMEONE changed my order!!! I AM SO FREAKIN' ANGRY THAT I WILL NEVER BUY CAT TOYS ON AMAZON AGAIN!!! THE SELLER WAS A REAL JERK!! AND MAY I ADD BLAMED AMAZON FOR CHANGING THE ORDER!! I DON'T NEED THIS INSULTING SHOPPING!!! NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY CAT TOYS FROM aMAZON OR THIS SELLER!! AND BY THE BY THIS LOOFA CAT TOY I THREW IN THE TRASH-IT WAS DIRTY AND CRAPY AND DISGUSTING- I WOULD NEVER ORDER THIS CRAP IN THE FIRST PLACE LET ALONE GIVE IT TO MY CAT! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! ps the catnip so called catnip i dry and old must be SO OLD I WOULD VEVER GIVE TO MY CAT!! BEWARE
3,Lo comercial de Susana Baca,"El disco contiene ejemplos buenos de ritmos como Landó, festejo y baladas. la bella voz de Susana Baca es una garantía. Realmente éste no es el mejor trabajo de Susana Baca. Pero el mérito es que con éste disco se abren las puertas del reconocimiento a la música del Perú Negro, que era hasta ahora poco conocido. Si no puede encontrar los discos ""Espíritu Vivo"" o ""Susana Baca"" de la misma cantante, éste es un buen comienzo para adentrarse en la música de la Costa Peruana.This cd is a good start for anyone interested in Afro-Peruvian music."
4,What do Hilary Clinton and Ann Richards Have in Common?,"They've overcome one of the double binds that confront women leaders. Jamieson examines five double binds or Catch-22's that can block women from success and reveals through personal stories and scholarly research how these double binds can be overcome. Any woman who wants to be a leader needs to begin by understanding what these binds are and how to confront them. As Jamieson says, ""the double bind is a strategy perennially used by those with power against those without."" Whether you call a bind a ""double standard,"" ""a no-win situation,"" or a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" understanding the ""binds that tie,"" can help any woman better position herself for success."
2,not great quality,"The picture looked like the stainless steel variety of HC, but the quality seemed cheap when I got them. Will do for general use, though. But if you have a critical application, go to a good hardware store and get a real HC."
3,Stories of stories 4,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening."
1,Uninspired performances in paltry sound,"Disconnected of context and isolated, these choral numbers don't make much musical sense. The composer obviously meant them to either compliment the overall musical texture or heighten the ongoing drama. All of the recordings appear to be pulled from previously released performances from the late 80s. Muti employs his usual paint-by-numbers artistry, with little style or drama to speak of. His Anvil Chorus is particularly rancid. Engineering is a further drawback. The choral sound is dry and distant making this one of the least sumptuous Verdi experiences."
5,"When life at the office is getting YOU down, read this.","Excellent book for employees and bosses - there may even be some real (scary) wisdom between the cartoons. On days that life in the office is getting you down, or if you ever fear you're taking life in the officetoo seriously, this book is a sure antidote. And, laughter is after all, the best medicine."
3,Only for people who work in a cube,"I usually enjoy Dilbert comics from the paper and expected a lot out of this book, but it didn't meet my expectations. Some of the comics are really funny and made me laugh out loud. However as I progressed through the chapters, I found the same basic theme repeating itself over and over again - that managers are idiots with bird sized brains and their only purpose in life is to make their employees miserable. To make things worse, Adams' prose and business advice is quite bad to read through. Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because I work in an office with few people who are all technical - no HR, no marketing and no sales. But I could relate to many situations described.This book is strictly for office goers."
4,"Good, but could use some improvement.","This book is supposed to be a mixture of words and comics. Unfortunately, some comics are too good for Adams to resist: he just can't use them only once. Other than that though, it is an interesting book, with both humor and, sadly, a bit of truth"
2,Not much help in keeping me awake while driving to work!,"The audio cassette is ho-hum at best, so I guess I should not really complain that it is so short ... < 1 hr. Scott Adams' speaking style is uninteresting and unstimulating. I had hoped for some of his cartoon humor and style to get through. Not a chance!The first half (side) seemed more of an attempt to justify this forey into book writing & only the second half (side) got down to the subject matter. While I agree with some of Adam's criticisms of modern-day save-your-business rituals, he seemed to discount each really insightful and on-target point with silly attempts at humor that weren't funny enough to be effective.The tape is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. The book??? I'll wait and borrow the hard copy from a fellow lemming."
2,Just becase I did'nt like it does mean that you wont.,I didn't think this book was particularity funny or useful. The jokes are obvious and easy to make. The books is well organized but honestly I just got board reading it. Weather your looking for books that are funny or about business environments I think there are better ones available.
3,Pages damaged on new book,Any Dilbert book is great but this was supposed to be a new book and interior pages were stained. I had to ship it out in a gift box so I didn't have time to return it or get an exchange.
3,"good book, good condition, good delivery time","Received it promptly, book was in good condition but the pages were made of low quality paper - dull n thin; you get what you pay for!!"
3,Dilbert Principle,"This book is wacky, zany, and humorous. Sometimes impossible, it portrays the picture of the workplace in the future. Workers are non-traditional and sometimes with out-of-this-world attitude. The elderly will have a hard time to accept the would be scenarios. The conversations are not typical of our grandparents' days. A warning to educators and authorities. They have to rethink their policies and programs if they want to avoid a future society like this."
5,Great!,I am a huge Dilbert fan and I think that this is one of Scott Adams's best. Keep up the good work.
3,Way too true!,"This book was all too true. Each chapter is a sarcastic and very accurate look at office politics, antics, trends, fads, useless people, etc"
2,Disappointing.,"Scott Adams should stick to comics.This book is funny, but most of his insights are better conveyed in the comic strips accompanying the text. Save your money: buy a collection of his comic strips instead.Adams OA5 management system has some good points but is naive."
2,Poorly Written,"I was in the courtroom for this entire trial, so it was interesting to see someone else's perspective on this horrendous case. In addition, Smith shares information that was not shared during the trial, which puts an interesting spin on things.However, this book seems fragmented and is poorly written...perhaps Mr. Smith was attempting to rush to get a book out about Longo first? It is in need of some editing!Also, I did not appreciate Smith's commentary near the end where he partially blames Longo's faith (and, it seems, faith in general) on what happened.This is an okay read for people who are fairly familiar with the situation, but I'm not sure anyone not familiar with the case could follow it."
1,Love Daddy,Reads like written by a newspaper reporter-No personal feel for the victims. Not even pictures of them! The last Carlton SMith book I will buy.
1,Religious Spin,"The author's focus on the religious background of Christian Longo appears prejudicial and sensationalistic. Outside of the personal statements attributed to Mr. Longo himself and one paragraph quoted from a web site, Smith's information regarding the Jehovah's Witness faith seems to have been gleaned from only those expressing an unfavorable opinion for which the basis of which is unknown.Mr. Smith irresponsibly uses Longo's religious affiliation as a scapegoat. This is a poorly researched and inaccurate depiction of this particular faith which is featured so prominently throughout this book."
3,Not Smith's best work,"Usually Smith does a much better job of making the reader care for the victims. This book is sorely lacking in that area.Also, the 7 murder charges (when there were only 4 victims) was never explained. I think more could have been done to expand on the way a ""cult"" can mentally affect a person, as many people read true crime for the psychological aspect.Not much time was spent on the trial, either, and I always look forward to that (especially the battle of the experts). This book merely summarizes the 6 weeks of the trial in one short chapter."
4,"Love, Daddy","Although this is an older story, I recently got a hold of this book to read. We live in the area that this took place and I remember that Christmas and the horror that was involved when a picture of little Zach showed up in our local paper. When these murders unfolded, it left our town very scared and heart broken. Here we were about to celebrate Christmas when our thoughts turned toward these children that would never see one again. This is a very good account of this creep Longo and Carlton Smith did a great job telling this story."
3,Pre-reading review.,"Clearly, this is more of a ""preview"" than a ""review."" However, those who offhandedly condemn the author for laying blame at the feet of Longo's cult connections cannot know the psychological and emotional toll they took. The kind of fear-inducing indoctrination used by this group's leaders (common to cults) cannot be so quickly dismissed.I'll be back to comment more intelligently when I have finished the book."
5,:0),"You know while reading this book i wondered what the title has to do with the book but towards the end it made sense...I thought it was a good read, I like Nicolette very strong and independent woman all in all a good lovable story about a princess and king....."
5,WONDERFUL HISTORICAL DRAMA,"This is a truly wonderful story of a single woman's fierce battle against the oppressive and corrupt government during the early 1900's. She blazed the trail of freedom and more importantly, revolution, that completely altered Chinese history. It's a remarkable movie filled with action, drama, revenge and sacrifice . An absolute must see"
5,Powerful Performance,"This CD clearly captures Eydie Gorme's vocal brillance. Eydie is known as a singer's singer, and her performances, here, are a pure joy to hear. From the lovely I Got Lost in His Arms (Barbra are you listening?) to the jazzy You're Getting to be a Habit with Me (eat your heart out Diana Krall), Gorme's considerable vocal power, incredible sense of timing and lyric interpretation cannot be denied. In addition, the sound quality and the fine arrangements of Don Costa makes this CD a must for anyone who enjoys classic standards sung as they were written to be sung."
5,just as great as the last two!,"i deff give this cd a ""2 thumbs up"" all of barlowgirl's works have been magnificant. i've loved seeing their music evolve from their debut to another jornal entry, to this. i love the distinctive sound they give their rock. my fave songs are i believe in love and one more round."
2,a near-disaster!,"I LOVE BarlowGirl's music, and the ""Deluxe"" edition has a very GOOD music-video DVD, making it a must-have item! But the music content on this album is their worst! Common sense says you ALWAYS put your BEST song the first song on an album! But did their producer do this on this album? NO! There is only one AMAZING song on this album: KEEP QUIET! (How can I keep QUIET"") KEEP QUIET is a DYNAMITE song! It is one of their best songs! So why did their producer foolishly put it as song number 4, when it SHOULD have been the album's first track number # 1 ! And million voices should have been track number 2 !Yes, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this deluxe album for the DVD! Which is WELL-WORTH owning for the incredible music videos, it contains! Yes, I'd definitely by this deluxe edition again, for the music videos!"
2,A major disapointment,"I am a huge fan of the first two BarlowGirl albums, but I must say this one is lacking severely compared to the first two. It starts off with one great rocker, and then immediately goes into two slow songs. After that it never really caught my attention because there was nothing there to get my attention.The remaining seven songs were all mid tempoed to slow songs that I just did not care for. I hope this is not the new path they are going down. This album is defnitely for a different crowd than the last two were. I desperately wanted to like this album, and I have been eagerly anticipating it for some time.I will put this disclaimer in here. I am not a fan of most bands in this genre. I like Killswitch Engage, Megadeth, As I Lay Dying, and Underoath, so maybe I am the exception and not the rule, but I doubt it."
2,More of the Same,"Honestly people, in case you haven't noticed, this album is exactly the same as every other album Barlow Girl has come out with. The songs all sound the same as they did before, both lyrically and musically. There's a good reason most Barlow Girl fans are between the ages of 10-14: they don't understand what good muisc is yet. There are only so many times you can say the same thing over and over again without becoming repentive, and they wore that out halfway through their first album. I'm hoping someday soon they leave the music business altogether."
2,Crikey Moses!,"What can I say? This is a crazy, crazy book. I read through it and thought, ""Hmmm, interesting."" Ginny goes through lots of phases in life, basically adapting to the people around her. She never speaks up for what she wants and the book never really goes anywhere. I guess that's the 'existentialism' ? side of it. The main message is 'Try everything in the world and be a chameleon and maybe you'll er...uh... end up at square one... a puzzling piece of fiction!"
5,"A poignant moving novel, achingly real and humorous","Ginny Babcock is the ultimate slacker, years before it became fashionable, or worse yet a media term to wrap a journalistic flag around. This book follows Ginny's misadventures, recorded with wry accuracy by the protagonist. A woman who is very intelligent but unable to make a niche for herself. What makes it so poignant to watch as she careens around from role to role is the hard fact that her mother dies slowly and is unable to provide Ginny with any profound relevations as the turbelence in her life grows to epic proportions. With the conclusion, one gets a strong sense that Ginny eventually straightens herself out."
2,Extremely flimsy,"Bought this for my nephew, who loves Afro Samurai. It was the only one I could find with a sheath and for the price, I figured I'd give it a shot. It didn't last long, maybe 2 weeks. Not worth it, even for the price."
1,Not ninja,"Aside from being very flimsy, it isn't even a ninja sword. Ninja swords aren't curved they're perfectly straight. Katanas (which would have been just as ""cool"" to name the thing) are the ones that have a curve. It makes a decent ""generic Asian"" sword for a kid's costume, but otherwise it's a waste."
2,Flimsy and breaks easy,"I bought this sword because I needed a good, plastic sword to spar with. It arrived on time, but the blade is very flimsy, and in fights it often shook back and forth. It was fun to fight with until it broke (Which was in 3 weeks.) If you want a sword to spar with, keep looking. You might even want to take a look at a boken (wooden sparring sword,) those look really good with costumes, and hardly ever break (only after intense boken-on-boken battles do they crack.)"
3,Who drank coffee before shipping this?,"Yes, I love, love this place setting. However, whoever the shipper was who shipped this place setting to me as a wedding gift also loved it. He/she loved it so much that he/she decided to use the saucer for his/her coffee before shipping it. The saucer was completely stained with coffee when I received it. Yuck!! I had to put it in the dishwasher immediately. I requested other Fiestaware on my wedding registry and now I'm wondering whether I'll be disgusted with more dirty dishes when I receive them. :("
2,White glaze scratches easily,"My husband and I ordered twelve place settings of Fiestaware in persimmon, turquoise, sunflower, heather, and white. We are very pleased with the purchase and love how the colors look together. The only complaint is that the glaze on the white plates seems to be more fragile than the other colors -- after only a few uses the dinner plates were covered with very dark knife scratches. The Amazon review says that scratches from flatware can be ""easily removed with a nonabrasive cleaner"" but I haven't been able to get them off. I have also noticed some production flaws (small bare spots, etc.) but these are minimal, and overall I think that Fiestaware is a great deal. I love how the dishes can go into the oven and how they don't get hot when microwaved. Also, we're very clumsy and haven't chipped a piece after 6 months of use. I'm giving 2 stars specifically to the white setting (and most people are probably not buying Fiesta in white!). I'd give 5 stars to the other colors."
3,Firsts or Seconds?,"I ordered 8 place settings last December and really do like them. I got a screaming price so I guess I shouldn't complain but I really feel the dishes I received are seconds. And I believe that Amazon know they are. The logo on the bottom of some of the pieces are smeared, and there are glazed over imperfections.I really can't believe that HL would like this quality to be thought of as their best. And Amazon should be ashamed by thinking its ok to sell seconds as long as you don't claim them to be first quality in the description."
5,my new china,"During the remodeling of my kitchen, I decided I needed new china. I purchased FiestaWare in many colors, and it looks beautiful with the new colors in the kitchen. I was extremely please with the service I got when ordering from Amazon and the prices are the best. Thanks for a wonderful internet ordering experience."
4,well made functional dinnerware,we own over fifty pieces of fiestaware about half of which is tangerine. we have fun mixing colors. all of the fiestaware we have received has been perfect.when the 20 piece sets are marked down and come with a free additional 5 piece set...you cannot beat the price for this quality! plus free shipping!
5,Fiesta Ware USA Made,"We recently purchased a cabin to retire/refire to and my wife was wanting new dishes. Probably a good idea. I just stipulated that she only purchase dishes MADE IN USA. So she began her quest. Fiesta Ware in made in West VIrginia and is a very nice shape. She went with multi-color set. Now she ""collects"" them as she finds the additional colors to fill the set.It has been fun for her and I actually get into it a bit. At least I pay the VISA bill. I like the fact that we are purchasing dishes made here in our country. They are quality made. They do not chip. The colors are very nice. And we get tons of compliments, as it is different. I like the set being different.Well made. USA made. Nice colors. Packaged well. Great sizes. Functional. Fun."
2,"So sad, so scratchy","I purchased eight 4 piece place settings in cobalt. No doubt, the color is beautiful! However, every plate that I opened had little scratches all over already, just in packaging. On the dark color of the cobalt, the scratches in the clear glaze really stand out. I can't imagine how badly this would scratch with everyday utensil use, if it scratches so easily just by stacking.For that much money per place setting, I was expecting more. So, sadly, I won't be keeping these :("
5,Made in the USA,"I purchased 2 - 4-piece place settings of Fiestaware, lemongrass and tangerine, for my daughters for Christmas. They had both expressed interest in Fiestaware and I thought this would make a gift that I could add to for all gift occasions. They were quite pleased and so was I. The Fiesta ware is beautiful and more importantly made in the USA (as a matter of fact our own state, West Virginia). I will purchase more place settings and serving pieces in the future. Thanks Amazon for carrying this merchandise."
2,"Fiesta 4-Piece Dinnerware Place Setting, Ivory","I wanted 4 dinner place settings of the Ivory, Fiesta 4-Piece Dinnerware Place Setting. I was mailed only 1 dinner place setting. To have a complete 4 dinner place setting with 4 piece dinnerware place sets it would be 30 dollars each dinnerware place set and I would need 4 totaling $120.00 dollars and that is too much money for me to spend on dinner dishes. Today it is snowing to return to the post office the one place set Ivory Fiesta 4-Piece Dinnerware Place Set. I plan to return the item to the post office when the weather is better. I do need the mailing return address for the Fiesta 4-Piece Dinnerware Place Setting, Ivory. Please submit the address to my email roseschulte@gmail.com. Thank You, Rose Schulte"
1,Damaged plate,I received the yellow Sm. plate in damaged condition and dont know how to get it replaced. Also I did not get the free promotional pasta bowls as offered with 4 piece set. Please advise at once as this is a xmas gift.Thank youJohn
1,Where's my other package?,"I ordered four ""Four Piece"" settings in the cobalt.Three boxes were delivered before Christmas (on the 23rd)but I am still waiting for the fourth box tobe sent. It is now the 27th."
1,Unknown,"Haven't received it yet. It's been a month, according to info from you it is due to be shipped in the middle of october"
1,broken item,I was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and I needed to send it back for a refund.
5,Pictures do not do them justice!!!,"I bought 6 of the 4 piece colbalt placesettings several months ago and they have been great. When the arrived I was happily shocked at how different they were than the pictures Amazon.com has of them. They were a much richer deeper blue with swirled accents of several different shades of lighter blue, a very nice appealing contrast. I have gotten several different compliments on them from some of my guests.The dishes are also quite substantial in both size and thickness a big plus for a guy like me. I have dropped several of them on the floor from the counter and they have held up to the abuse of myself and my two roommates (wish I could say the same for my glasses).I can't wait to add to my beginning collection."
3,"Fiesta ware is great, but CHECK COLORS BEFORE YOU BUY!","Fiesta ware is great stuff, but be sure to check colors before you buy a bunch! Fortunately, I thought of this ahead of time and ordered a small saucer for only a few dollars before going for the full place settings.Shamrock is not nearly as light as it appears on most of the Amazon listings. Check the manufacturer's website or find one of the darker looking pieces on Amazon for a more accurate color."
3,I love fiesta,"They seemed to be seconds though as I have every set made over past 50 years and these had bumps, etc. in the glaze."
2,Etched and worn in a period of months,I have owned these dishes for about 3 years now and am already looking to replace them. They look like I have had them for 30 years--etched terribly from the use of silverware. I am embarrassed to use them with company. I will never buy fiestaware again. What an expensive lesson!
3,surprised to find cup chipped,the two sets of black fiesta wear was packaged so good but i was surprised when my daughter opened them up and one of the black coffee mugs had a chip on it. i can't believe this happened because it was packaged so well. i did not want to send it back for a replacement of the one cup.
5,Fiesta 4 place setting/white,I love the Fiesta Ware. I ordered the 4 place setting which has a mug style cup and not cup and saucer. Other dish settings had the cup and saucer and the cup wan't big enough and I never used the saucers. This was at a very good price. My old dishes were almost 20 years old and I had shopped several times for what I was going to replace my old dishes with and I love my choice. I can always add to it over the years and it will never go out of style. You can get replacement pieces which will save in the long run. I will never have to shop again for any thing else.
3,Imperfections,"After finally purchasing my dream dishes, I purchased 8- 4 piece place settings, I was disappointed. The dishes were covered with a thick coating of dust. Under the dust were several imperfections. Didn't realize I was purchasing, non-1st quality merchandise. The price was too good, so I am settling."
5,Others State Poorly Packed for Shipping...,"I am not going to bore you with my comments on Fiesta...I love it! As far as packaging goes, I didn't have any problems with my orders (all 3 shipments arrived safely.) For the price and promotions offered, you can't beat Amazon!"
3,scratches over time,It's stoneware so you know it's going to break and it's heavy to hold. I've had these for a few years now. I stack them in the cupboard like I've done w/ other dishes like Oneida (porcelain) or Corelle (glass). The surface of the Fiesta will scratch over time when stacked unlike the others I've owned. So they won't continue to look nice over time unless you take an extra effort to make sure they don't come in contact w/ one another. I'm getting rid of them.
3,"Beautiful dishes, but better deals on Fiestaware elsewhere","I purchased the 4 piece set in turquoise. The color is amazing, and despite a badly beat up box, the dishes arrived safe and sound. Being a new Fiestaware buyer, I was dismayed to see our local department store running a special on a 5 piece set for exactly the same price. Weirdly, this set from Amazon does not include the saucer for the cup.It's totally my fault for not checking into this beforehand. It never occurred to me - I figured a set of Fiestaware was the same no matter where it was purchased, and would contain the same pieces. So, if you want the full set, for the same price (or less), shop elsewhere."
5,Beautiful dinnerware,American made and is solidly constructed. I would love to collect all the pieces for this. Great choice of colors.
4,Peacock is a winner,I ordered this setting to go with pieces I already have in other colors. Love the peacock blue. I think it is my favorite color so far. Red I think will be next. Only problem is I am running out of cupboard space...
5,Great dishes in fun colors.,"I absolutely love these dishes. I have complete sets in Cobalt, Plum, Shamrock, Sunflower, and Tangerine. I have pre-ordered the Scarlet and can't wait to receive it. They are very high quality and can stand up to some major abuse. The colors are rich and vibrant and have slight variances that make each piece distinct and interesting. You may read reviews about the ""flaws"" in Fiestaware but I feel that this helps to lend to the charactor and charm of each piece. I have never encountered a flaw that was either unatractive or made the dish unusable. If you want a unique place setting that will get you compliments every time, these are the dishes for you."
4,Fiesta Dinner ware,We use Fiesta for our everyday dishes and have for many years. We have given our daughter a starter set last year for Christmas and this last order was to add to her collection. We love their durability and style.
5,As the Years Pass the Compliments keep coming.,I have these in 8 different colors. I started getting them around 1995 a 5 pc set at a time. I choose them because they are timeless. They are so much fun to mix and match the plates. I also have the flatware.When guests walk into the kitchen and see the lively table it always beings a compliment.They are so durable that I have not one crack or chip yet.I highly recommend the set. Mixing and matching is so much fun it makes them new everytime.
5,Fiesta is the best!,"This set arrived shattered. I was disappointed and immediately contacted Amazon. I could not believe how quickly they responded, or how well. They sent me a replacement set the next day, via overnight shipping. It arrived in perfect condition. I do think they could save themselves some trouble if it were packed better, but after their great customer service I didn't really care too much. Also, Fiesta really is the best. The dishes rarely break and put other dinnerware to shame. I have pieces that are original that my father gave me, and new ones I have bought myself. They compliment each other wonderfully. I'll never buy anything else."
1,Color is not accurate,"The color here looks really light green, but in actuality it is a true shamrock green. The difference is huge from what you see here and on the Fiestaware web site. It's more grass-colored. The quality is fine, but the color is seriously misleading."
2,A copy is a copy sometimes,"Although I would buy other pieces compared to the original Fiestware, this line is a dissapointment. I bought two (4) piece sets in Cinnabar and Cobolt. The color is on the weak side and the Cinnabar bowl had an imperfection in the glaze. I just didn't have the time to return it.Like I said, I would buy more because I love the array of colors but this is an ok knockoff and nothing more if you're familiar with the originals."
1,Fiestaware Persimmon 831 4-Piece Dinnerware Placesetting,"Really poor color matching. The cups weren't even the same color category as the plates. Some pieces never arrived many weeks after the order. Trying to return it introduced us to the nonexistent customer support department at Amazon. Their emails don't accept replies (I wonder why) and just try to find the form for submitting a message - it's buried so deep in their site I'm suprised it wasn't crushed by the weight of all the pages above it. And then, when you do submit a message, no one reads it...you just can a nonsensical canned reply. In the future I wouldn't buy anything from Amazon I couldn't afford to lose."
3,Want me to rate this?,I'd love to rate this product. But I ordered it in November and now its January 6 and I still don't have it nor have I received any info on when I might receive it (the website says estimated ship date is between December 10 and December 18). So much for it being a Christmas present...
4,Mugs are great,"I prefer a mug over a tea cup so the 4 piece place setting was the way to go for me. I also have the Java mugs that are just that little bit bigger with the handle longer so you can slip a couple fingers in and hug your mug. Fiestaware is durable, sturdy, and long lasting. The design is clean and simple. The colors can be combined in endless combinations to suit your every mood. The Sunflower is a bit to yellow for me but I mix it with the other colors and it adds a ray of sunshine to the darkest day. The color is the reason I didn't give this 5 stars."
5,Beautiful,Her voice and music is amazing. This CD brings calm and peace and allows ones mind to clear and then focus on inner peace.
3,Lonely hearts,"Back Cover description: Tate Montgomery Needed A New Life. And Johanna Patterson was the kind of woman who could make him leave the past behind. But how would he ever convince this reclusive spinster to open up her heart to him and his boys? It seemed to Johanna that she had always been alone. Until the day that Tate Montgomery turned up at her farm with a ready-made family, and an offer that would change her life forever.The book moves well until the sister-in-law shows up. I found that part of the story annoying. Johanna grows to trust Tate, she grows to love the boys and they put their pasts to rest. I didn't find myself crying, so maybe I missed something that the other reviewers saw."
5,"great book, loved this story - recomend to history reader buffs","Loved this story, give it a try and you will like it too. This is a dream guy, story told in a way that make you wish for times when men were men without over powering the women."
5,Good story,"I'm beginning to think a lot of people who read 19th century novels like this one think the stories should fall into a fomular where everything is perfect and ends equally as perfect. And, when they don't they give them a bad review. This book is well written and the story is realistic, and as far as I'm concerned that's what counts."
2,Good-Bad Movie,"Belushi is soooo embarrassingly bad that his performance actually makes the movie worthwhile.The film overall you ask ? Well, there's a very good reason for its relative obscurity...it's just awful."
3,Its Sahara...but not really Sahara,This has been a difficult movie to find over the years so nice to see it available and in great quality as well. Personally I dont think you can compare it to the original which was an absolute masterpiece but its a decent film in its own right and well worth having in your collection.
5,Most Talented! Keep on watch!,"This young man is a phenomenon! He plays like a god indeed! Must be perfectly ambidextrous, to have such nimble hands! If he keeps up the good work (which sometimes is not the case with highly talented people), he will go very far! I keep all my fingers crossed for him! Very enjoyable! Also google him, you can see some very nice videos about his work and progress."
4,Reviewed By Alan Gerrard,"Vic Deakin is a vicious crime boss. He is also a psychopath with a mother complex. A doomed robbery and the eventual death of his ailing mother starts to push Deakin clean over the edge and into the waiting hands of the law. A tough, brutal thriller, written by James Mitchell under the name of Barlow. Made into a film called ""Villain"" in 1971 starring Richard Burton."
5,Excellent low budget Indy,An extremely well crafted and beautifully shot small film. Big budget films should take lessons from these guys. As an industry participant I can really appreciate the acting and the artistry that went into this project. Sundowning is very moving and engaging.
4,Sundowning,"I have worked in the field of aging for over 20 years. Few films begin to touch the issues that families face when dealing with an Alzheimer's-like dementia diagnosis. Although all situations are different, the film makers do a nice job of portraying a real life-like family situation and their reaction to this disease and the implications on the family dynamics."
3,Inspiring,"The first book I read in my journey towards raw. I found this to be much more helpful as an inspirational story of how a raw lifestyle can heal and allpw one to reach their optimal life. However, as a course of study it is more drastic than anything else I've read. However, it is understandable because his situation was extreme."
5,I am so grateful!,"I am so grateful to Matthew Grace for all he has contributed to my life and my future...and I haven't even met him! After reading his book, I went to his website ... which is listed on the copyright page of his book - and I was thrilled to see that he has tapes from his lecture series available. He has made such a contribution to my health. Thank you for that."
5,this is the best!!,i got this about a week ago and my brother and i can't get off of the computer. What all of the other people say is really untrue it so much better gameplay then the '03 version. it never gets boring!P.S. IT IS SUPPOSED TO SKIP THE PARTS IF YOU PRESS THE SPACE BUTTON!!!!
2,disappointed,I was really disappointed in this game. I thoght that this was not as good as the others.
1,One star is being generous,"The 3-d graphics although an improvement, are hardly worth the effort. The gameplay is hard and frustrating, the option to save is gone and so you have to finish the 2 hour marathon in one sitting, the characters are bland and ""robotic"" as one fellow reviewer had the good sense to say. Backyard Baseball 2005 is a far worse than the prevous years."
1,Not compatible with certain workstations,"Beware of purchasing Backyard Baseball 2005. This version requires DirectX 9.0 and a driver that is compatible with 9.0. I just finished the run around with Atari Tech support and the burden is on me to update my XP machine which has been unsuccessful - they do not have a patch - shame on them!I loved their Backyard 2003 versions, but will avoid purchasing their sequels."
1,Worst of the Backyard Baseball series,"I just purchased this product today for my seven-year-old son, and I must say that this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever wasted $19.99 on. We own the two previous versions of Backyard Baseball, as well as Backyard Football 2002 and though they were simply wonderful products. We were very excited to get the latest version of Backyard Baseball, until we got it home and tried to run it. I has failed to run on three computers, a Sony PIII 600 running WIN98, and a Gateway P4 1.9ghz and a clone AMD Athlon 1100 both running XP. On the Sony and AMD the game simply quits at random spots, or when the space bar is pressed. The Gateway bluescreens during the introduction. Since this is the first version with the Atari label on it, I can only assume Atari 'tweaked it', ruining the gaming pleasure for thousands of children.Don't waste your money. Buy the older version. It works great!"
5,Great game!,"I just picked up Backyard Baseball 2005 for the PC and I must say, it's quite a cool game! All the locations you can play in are quite cool looking and varied, and the pros as kids are hilarious! I love me some Ichiro! I'm about halfway through my first season and I can't stop playing it. Check it out!"
5,great and fun,i love this game. i dont have it but i played it at a friends house. i love choosing a team and then choosing the posisions also i am soooo good at batting. my mom ordered it for me so i cant wait. i could seen more features to this game if my friend was not a hog and let me play more(she loves baseball and i dont blame her)you should get it even if you never played the sport.
2,Tegan and Sara-This Business of Art,"I was disappointed in this CD as I love the 3 newer releases from them, it is ok, but I would not recommend it."
5,Absolutely Stunning....,"This CD is amazing! from the opening track ""the first"" to it's closing track ""superstar""! It's Brilliant. I have yet to see them live but from what I've heard they are amazing! Tegan and Sara have to be the freshest and most brilliant act I have heard in a long time. Even though this album is their second, I'm sure there will be alot more to come. Their first album containing 7 of these songs and ""divided"" which is one of my favourite songs sung by the twins. If you have yet to hear this album go out and buy it now you wont be sorry!"
5,"Better than clean underwear. Well, maybe not that good...","I say move over all you wishy-washy, lyrically transient, vocally programmed army of female ""singer/songwriters."" Tegan and Sara are more than just a wrinkle in the fabric of music (or lint in a belly-button), they are more like those huge creases that are left in the shirts ironed by coping husbands when their wives are sick. The only thing better than Tegan and Sara's ""This Business of Art"" is licking brownie batter off your fingers. But licking brownie batter off your fingers would only rock to its fullest potential if you were listening to Tegan and Sara while doing your best Homer Simpson hoovering impression."
3,Okay - Not Great,"I am a huge Tegan and Sara fan.As I listen to The Business of Art I feel like they don't quite ""know"" themselves yet. It sounds more like Melissa Etheridge/Alanis Morsette than Tegan and Sara. It's a good album but not as great as The Con/Sainthood."
5,Some of the most amazing music I have ever heard,"I dont normally listen to this kind of music and I tend to like music more to the tune of Korn and Rage against the Machine but these two girls have the most beautiful voices I have ever heard and somehow their songs are able to convey wit,emotion, and excitement so easily that it amazes me (ie My Number, Superstar). I only caught a few seconds of ""the First"" on Much Music and that was enough to get me to buy the cD. I was hoping to see T & S when they came to Ottawa but I got kicked out of the show because I had no I.D.(I lost my wallet for real!) so I havent had the pleasure of hearing them play live. Buy this Cd then get their other songs off Napster(cleaver meals, welcome home, our trees) as their first cd Under Feet like Ours is almost impossible to find."
1,"good book, poor condition","The book came in a timely way and had good designs. Too bad pages were stuck together with coffee and it kind of smelled of mold. Oh well, I can make good borders...."
3,Durability issues,"These gloves are good for running, but won't keep your hands warm if it's too windy. My only concern is about their durability. I've used them last winter for running (in Fayetteville, AR) and while traveling in Montana (Glacier and Yellowstone) during the end of Spring. The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure."
4,Perfect for what I need,We have two PitBulls who regardless of the weather need to get their daily run in. I had been wearing bulky thick gloves that just did not seem to work well with a leash in each hand. I have worn these everyday for the past week. The weather has been anywhere from 15-45 degrees. So far my hands have not gotten cold. It has been pretty dry so I am curious to see how they do in rain or snow. They have held up great so far with a 50lb Pittie in each hand.
3,Good for Spring Usage,"I bought this product for protecting my hands from frozen winter in NY. Well..... didn't work effectively. Luckily, this year (2012), we didn't get much of frozen weather so it's all cool! I highly recommend to use this for spring running! 50 or 60 degrees! Not recommended for 40 degrees or under! Get something else!"
2,Twas good until the final battle,"You have to be an expert to kill the final colossus, even after reading the online cheats and guides. The final battle goes far beyond challenging to just simply annoying. I liked the game until this final battle. The save points are non-existant except after you kill a colossus, so be prepared to spend lots of hours playing the same final segment over and over again unless you are an expert. The hardest of the first 1-15 monsters took me a few hours to kill (each), but #16 has been defeating me for over a week and I've re-played it dozens of hours. I consider the final battle a design flaw which ruins the overall game because what good is it if you can't finish it?"
3,More of a demo than a game,"Apparently a lot of people really like 'boss fights'. If you're one of them, this game will probably blow you away. Personally, I hate the stale old cliché of the 'end of level boss', and this game doesn't really have anything else to offer.The graphics are artistically interesting, but the frame rate drop is horrendous at times. The landscape is a vast wilderness--beautifully rendered, but ultimately inherently empty and dull.The fights themselves can be frustrating. If they were inserted into an actual game they would be great, but after finishing the first my immediate thought was dread that I had a dozen more like that ahead. I view 'boss fights' as the chore you have to perform to get to the next interesting bit of game, and in this case unfortunately there's no interesting bit of game in between them."
2,Boring,"All it really is is fighting these really huge beasts. The horse is really hard to navigate, there's nobody to talk to, no buildings to go into and the big beasts you have to fight are really hard to fight.But running around the landscape is kinda fun. Some of the scenery is really pretty but if I had played this before buying it-I would not have spent 20 bucks on it."
2,"Challenging ""Classic""",I couldn't beat it. So I forfeited my right to continue. I don't cheat (also known as strategy guides).-PabloG.
1,Wow Amazing Yaddah Yaddah Yaddah,The Low Down:No little peons or mini-bosses. You are sent out to hunt 16 Collusi to bring your lovely lady back from the dead. That's it. And wow is it a spectacular ride.Story: Nice and no messing around.Animation: Breathtaking. Honestly.Originality: Imagine a Tetris you can kill. How's that?Play: The first eight are daunting; but not really that bad. Then 9 Steps in. Imagine a game set on Medium difficulty and half way through shooting up to God mode. Very Unforgiving.
1,I don't get the popularity.,"I have played and beaten this game, and I honestly have to say I don't get the fanaticism. This game is comprised more or less of huge stretches of empty land, no characters to interact or battle with other than the collosi themselves, and for the most part, had a horrid control system and the camera angles were equally bad. To honestly sum up this game, it's nothing but 16 boss fights and 5-6 hours of pointless travel time just to get to the bosses. And the reward for actually beating all of them? Sure, the girl gets brought back to life...and your character dies. So it's a really horrid ending too. Visually? Soundwise? Sure, the game is fantastic, but if you're wanting actual 'depth' to a game, this game really isn't for you."
