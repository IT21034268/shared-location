5,Amazing,Ok ok not quite as good as TSC but still amazingly unique and heavy. BTBAM have not lost their touch. Alaska is a bit easier to get into and still ultra progressive and heavy. The vocals are a bit more diverse. Selkies is a masterpiece! If you like hardcore music or progressive music you HAVE to check these guys out and listen to at least 3 songs! If you like BTBAM this album won't dissapoint.
4,rockin,"Well I'd say that this album is pretty sweet. At first spin I thought, ""Hmmm... this sounds like loud nonsense."" But with the second go around I heard what i was listening for. The guitars are layered and killer. Super heavy. The drums will destroy you're brain. Very intricate. The bass pummels you into submission and totally drives it all. The vocals are harsh most of the time but just when you've settled into this they switch it up on you.There is quite a bit of randomness that they incorporate into their songs. But the randomness is awesome. At first I kinda thought it was immature until I realized how well its done. Just listen to the opener ""All Bodies"" and hear high pitched riffs during pounding heaviness that almost sounds out of place but totally ties it all together. The breakdowns are amazing. They can be epic at times even, hence ""Backwards Marathon"" (which might be my favorite on the album.) These guys totally rock out. Its well worth the cash. Heavy, poetic metal. Buy it."
3,The only good songs in this album is Selkies and Backwards Marathon...,"This album is pretty much way different than their previous albums: The Silent Circus and the self-titled ep, and not in a good way. They actually went from uniqueness metal to just original metalcore. In my opinion, the silent circus actually defeats alaska 100 times over. My reason? The album, the silent circus, not only transitioned from hard to soft and had an entire track of singing, but in the hard songs they actually had crazy breakdowns, a delayed breakdown (very rare but kick ass), and overall, pure talent. I'm not saying alaska sux, i'm just saying that it sounds way different than the silent circus. So, to those who are getting into this band, take this advice. If you were to choose to buy Alaska first or the Silent Circus first, I'd recommend u buy the Silent Circus and the self-titled ep first, and then, if u want, Alaska."
3,Well....,"Best Song: The PrimerAlaska's good, but it's also mad [...] from the band Wintersun as well as power metal titans Rhapsody and Dragonforce. This will break new ground, and will gain them fame and title, so anything I have to say won't matter. But still, nothing compares to their first record, although Alaska is sooo much better than The Silent Circus. I agree also that Between the Buried and me is nothing like Mars Volta or System of a Down. Paul Waggoner is a good writer, but hasn't a chance on someone like Herman Li from Dragonforce. Finally, Tommy Rogers needs to realize that he is not Mike Patton."
2,I was expecting a lot more...,"First of all, quoting Morbid Angel when talking about this band is very stupid. This isn't even remarkably close to being technical extreme death metal.Secondly, what happened to this band, for Christ sake? The singer is singing in a so ridiculous affected voice that it makes me laugh so hard. ""It's raining... IT'S RAINING!!!!"" Hahaha... Jesus, that falsetto is so funny. It sounds like The Darkness singer.The vocals are a joke. The metalcore scene is becoming a joke because of bands who once were agressive and original, and that now are becoming Dillinger Escape Plan's new sound rip-offs.There's no originality in clean vocals when the singer can't sing. It sounds dumb and mellow. Every 2 minutes, there's a breakdown. I'm sure their fan base will grow larger now. As for me, I really liked this band from their previous releases.Listen to Glass Casket's new album for heaviness. Please, metalcore scene, stop this trend."
3,I Have Claustrophobia,"Between the Buried and Me's ""Alaska"" was described as many as ""claustrophobic"", and I must agree with them. Musically, the band continues to experiment and break new ground, and it sounds amazing! Unfortunately, I can't say that I enjoy Tommy Roger's growling...his singing on the other hand is fantastic, but his growl begins to wear on the listener. There are some standout tracks though...and the first one being ""Selkies: the Endless Obsession, following close behind (in my opinion) would have to be ""All Bodies."" Between the Buried and Me are an amazing talented and experimental band, I enjoy their music just as much as any metal head out there, but would it be too much to ask for if Rogers could experimental more with his growl? That's just my opinion."
2,MISLABELED,"It's an excellent album, and I do love this band.However... as this review is about an Amazon purchase, I do feel a need to comment.The title implies that it is a cd album which also includes a 'bonus DVD.' There was NO DVD included in this case. In fact, there is no place within for one, and there was no mention of a DVD on any of the outside shrinkwrap. So, this leads me to believe that for some reason Amazon has it mislabelled.At first I thought they sent me the wrong item, as in perhaps they sent just the cd and not the cd/DVD combo. But no, even the packing slip mentions 'bonus DVD' after the title, and a search on Amazon for a different version of Alaska brings up only the mp3 download version of this album.So, if you're buying this because you're excited you may get to see BTBM recorded live, or videos or something, don't bother. If you're okay with the fact that this is just a single cd, then buy it (it does say 2 cds included in the description)."
4,awesome,the cd is good. the silent circus is i think better.but i dont know much. the cd is way fun though.
4,Its time,It is time that this genre gets a bit of a wake up call. most metal today is so boring and one sided. this si a great album.
1,Cheaply made,"I bought this digital camera for a vacation and have been embarrased ever since over the cheapness in quality of this camera. The battery door falls off and the batteries run out quickly. It doesn't stay on for more than a few seconds, causing the picture taker to miss shots over and over again. I spent a good deal on the camera with a upgraded digital card and now it is rarely used because it's such a piece of junk. I won't buy another Vivitar after this one. It's worth the money to buy a better brand, like a Canon or Nikon. I have a Nikon Coolpix now and I love it! Wish I'd spent that money the first time instead of on the Vivitar."
1,what a piece of junk!,"I bought this camera for my 8 year old son because he was justbeginning to show interest in cameras. I assumed all digital camerashave a photo viewer window that will show the photos as you take them.The only thing I made sure was that it is pc and mac compatible. So,everytime the photos are taken they have to be downloaded to a computer to discard unwanted photos...The buttons are hard to use and what a disappointed. I'll take the lossand buy my son another digital camera!"
5,Mets Car Flag,"Flag was exactly as I expected and is a great way to express my love for the Mets! Now I am always able to find my car, even in parking lots:)"
2,Spend your money on environmental writing with substance.,"Mediocre, with a few moments of good writing, but the entire theme is contrived. Spend your money on real environmental writing, for example Paul Shepard and Jerry Mander."
3,Does not fit mountain bikes,"Bought four of these (2 mountain, 2 road). Fits the road great, but not the mountain. I have had to deflate the mountain bike tires to get them to fit. Very misleading on the part of the manufacturer."
4,Works just like it says,"Works great hanging a almost any bike from the wall. It wont hang anything with fat tires on it, also dont hang it to high because when you do this the tires will roll down a little and get caught up in the spokes. So pay attention when you take the bike off the rack or you could damage your spokes."
5,Awesome Rack!,"This works PERFECTLY!.. It is super easy to use and looks great!..**WARNING** As other reviews have mentioned, this will NOT fit a full size mountain bike tire.. My hybrid bike tire fits PERFECT though."
2,Bigger than it looks,This is larger than it looks and didn't on the beam in my garage. There are smaller hooks out there that do exactly the same thing. Keep this in mind if younger working In a tight space.
4,Good product,"A nice, simple solution to getting a bike off the floor in a an apartment where space is at a premium."
5,Works well,"Not much to say, worked great for me. Stayed in the wall, didn't damage my rims, and helped save space in my tiny apartment."
4,Brunner's Art Does It All,"The art and the color win this series, plus a little Eastern religion thrown in. Dr. Strange overcomes the personal fear of his imperiling situation, which is crucial to his struggle to get back to the ""real"" universe with his girlfriend Clea, manservant Wong, and life as he knows it. The underestimated opponent Silver Dagger is a good physically agile foil to Strange's retiring meditative nature, and Strange's ""reunion"" with his allies, the Defenders, adds a unique twist. The plot is a little simplistic once you get over being awed by Brunner's artwork, but I first read it when I was 12 years old and it was right at my level then. Each comic book, too, had to have a limited amount of closure until the next issue to avoid too much frustration (back then a month was a long time to wait), so that adds to the excitement--you think it's over but it's not.My favorite line in the whole saga is: ""Do you not yet underSTAND that I am a Sorcerer Supreme???"""
3,popculture and beyond,"This book is a collection of early Dr. Strange stories Marvel Premiere 9-10 and 12-14 as well as Dr. Strange (vol 2) 1,2, 4,5. I dont think they hold a candle to contemporary stories, but if your looking for a bit of nostalgia its a decent read. These stories set the stage for Dr. Strange's transformation from apprentice to sorcerer supreme. My recomendation for someone looking for a good story in this genre would be Neil Gaiman's Sandman, the most recent Captain Marvel books, and the Earth X series."
4,Mark Eitzel still rocks,"Mark's work with the Greek instruments takes one back at first, but then the familiarity of the songs begins to grow that extra nuance by performing them this way. It's a good addition to the Mark Eitzel fan's collection."
4,"A great find, but don't buy it here","As a longtime Eitzel fan who's been a bit disappointed with his last few efforts, I was pleasantly surprised. The Greek instrumentation adds a sort of world-music timelessness. Well worth tracking down. But try to pick it up at the UK version of this site -- saves money, even with shipping."
2,Disappointing,Quite disappointing: just one B&W picture and a little bit of informations for every boat. Money almost wasted.
3,chris craft: the essential,Book was OK for a referance type for the early years of chris craft. just pictures and data on each boat. No details or informatived storys on anything. But it is very interesting and can settle alot of discussions.
4,Chris Craft Essentials,"This is a very good book for someone who wants to look up information on most any Chris Craft boat. It is unfortunate that the pictures are black and white and not in color. It is also somewhat disjointed in the layout. It goes from years to types of boats to years and I feel would be better representated if it went by year.Thanks,Richard"
2,"Okay, but not what I was looking for.","This appears to be a comprehensive guide to all boats manufactured by Chris Craft, however it did not provide the history or details that I was looking for. Simply provides a one page sheet for each craft detailing basic specifications."
4,if you're not put off by other people's dirty laundry...,"...this is a film for you. If you enjoy old school film noir classics, good writing and you have a foot fetish, this film is for you. The double entendres and one liners, which are cleverly woven into the dialogue will appeal to grown-ups, while the the use of puppets in lieu of actors makes it a perfect stocking stuffer for kids of all ages. You might say, ""one size fits all""."
4,watch it more than once,"Like the classic film noirs that it spoofs, if you only view this once all the pieces may not fall into place... but they do. It's just a lot to take in (the puns, plot and puppets) with only one viewing. I've watched it 3 times now and I catch something new each time. If you're not a repeat movie watcher, one viewing will give you laughs and a good film noir storyline, but for me the deeper meaning was more apparent after the second viewing."
4,a fun airsoft gun,Hi i am 1 years old and have fun with airsoft guns. I dont play in leagues or anything like that but just fool around with friends. I have to say these guns are just for fun they are like 150 fps and more around there but u cant even hit like from 15 20 feet somone with a little wind. But what is great is for inside the house little trick guns that only hurt a little . IF u want to use these guns for like more then foolin around i dont know what you are thinking. The shiiping is amazing fast and good quality plastic for 5$ a gun
2,Nice monitor not so good TV tuner,For the price the unit has a decent display but the TV tuner is the worst. All local stations tuned in with the attached antenna are snowy and even the strong stations had a lot of interference. When connected to CATV cable was only able to get local stations and reception was still just as bad. Probably would be a good monitor but is not a good TV.
2,Problem,One of the casters did not hold. it broke loose and cause me to fall. The other three are fine so far the chair is NOT stable
3,...grapes?o.0,"...Okay..so my roommate and I opened it and..it smelled like grapes. o.0..We were like..O...kay.. And like other reviews say, yeah, it's huge >_< Like a big..grapey..worm..Don't get it if you're small waisted!"
4,Very happy,"Just tossed a more expensive shower head in the garbage. It didn't have enough pressure to wash the soap off of you, let alone wash the shampoo out of your hair. It was also falling apart. I then ordered this Water Pik Shower Head based on reviews. We've had it awhile now and we are very happy with it. Great pressure, after a minor adjustment, and it seems to be holding up well. No complaints."
3,"Dynamite Cop...it isn't as ""dynamite"" as it seems","I bought this game thinking that it would take up hours of my time, and that it would be fun. I was right in thinking that it was fun, but the game is WAY too short. There's almost no strategy in this game... if you know how to mash the buttons repeatedly for a long time then you'll beat this game in about twenty minutes. Sure there are a plethora of weapons to use, and you can play with a friend cooperatively (or against each other) but it won't entertain you forever. Although you get to chose from three players (and chose from three differennt starting points) all routes in the game are basically the same. If you like fighting games with tons of weapons, then get it. However, if you want to be satisfied with a game for more than twenty minutes, I'm sure you can find something better..."
4,It's an awesome game!,"SEGA has done it again! They have another killer game for their Dreamcast. It's graphics are great, it has addicitive gameplay, and it has really cool weapons."
4,Fun But not very long,The game is simple. It is very fun and exciting because it has tons of cool wepons and very cool hand to hand fighting. The only bad thing about it is that it is a very short game. If you like endless gun fights and arcade style fighting this game is for you.
4,"Bad game, don't buy it","Rent it first! within a half hour of sitting down with it, I beat it. It's so short! graphics are horrible as well"
2,Author stikes me as needy,"While this book did expose some of the very bizarre practices of the Mormon church, it stuck me that the author was focused on which religion is ""true"". I would rather have had the author just tell us about his Mormon experiences and leave off the part about how he had now discovered that the ""truth"" lay in Jesus Christ. I couldn't help but wonder when Jesus might get a little old for him, or rather when some of the practices of fundamentalist Christians might start looking a bit bizarre. In short, I feel that the author is a spiritually and emotionally needy person who can't get through life without a crutch, be it Mormonism or Christian fundamentalism."
4,very insite-full,"I found this book to be very heart felt, kind and gentle as a way of introducing a non-mormon into the core of the religion and also provoking mormons to consider the things they have been taught and the way they have been taught. I feel that Christianity became an option... a true belief is not so until one CHOOSES this belief out of options. This man considered something else and came to find his truth. That is the most important thing that anyone choosing belief or faith should do. The bible says test all things and cling to what is good. I dont think blind faith without proving it in your own life is faith at all. This book may help mormons to consider other options based on Mr. Spencers story and come to find the truth-not what someone else has told them, not what mom and dad and grandma and grandpa did, but what an individual human knows as truth. Without asking one will never find the answer"
1,Do I Really Have to Give Him a Star?,"I've read most of what James Spencer has written -- some of it very, very carefully. I've even had the distinct non-pleasure of corresponding with him, in hopes of getting him to explain or justify some of his more outlandish statements. I'll summarize my conclusion very bluntly: James Spencer's writing is nearly as reliable as the ""National Inquirer,"" but far more malicious. He is not to be trusted. There are plenty of serious books on Mormonism, but none of them bears the name of Jim Spencer. Nor, for that matter, does any of them bear the name of his associates Ed Decker and Bill Schnoebelen. Heck, even Jerald and Sandra Tanner, career anti-Mormons that they are, disdain this trio."
1,tired,I am so tired of these types of stories. Always using rationalization and semi truths to sell their ideas to others. Aren't we all better if we seek to understand rather than belittle and put down others beliefs-especially the ones we don't understand. Agree to disagree but don't blame others for your own choices. I have great respect for faithful Christians of all religions even though I don't agree with their doctrine. Don't be swayed by a few good writing skills and a sincere manner. There are a lot of people who sincerly believe things that are simply not true.
3,Too many concepts in one DVD,"This DVD should be split into two DVD's. One DVD for numbers and counting by 1. Another DVD for counting in multiples and math. Sesame Street tries to include both concepts in one DVD - which is a bad idea. My daughter is 20 months old and numbers/counting is fine. However when they start doing addition and counting by 2's, 5's, 10's etc, it totally loses her. How can a child grasp counting in multiples and math when they're just learning 1,2,3...10? I would've ended the DVD after the counting by 1 portion, but the math is mixed in. For that reason, I enjoyed part of the DVD only. The ""ABC's with Elmo"" DVD is a lot better. It focuses on letters/alphabet without attempting to include spelling also. Let children grasp the base concepts first - before moving on to more advanced concepts."
4,This movie got my 2 year old counting!,"My 2 year old had the ABC's down, but all numbers were 2. She got this DVD for christmas and within a couple weeks was counting 1-10 no problem. She loves Elmo and is willing to watch him many times over which is great when she is learning something. I agree with other posts that the skip counting and math were a little unexpected and over her head. She still enjoys the movie, but is no longer interested in singing and counting along when it comes to the math. I'm sure she will still love to watch it over the next year and it just might sink in where she can enjoy it more."
5,I love this shoe,This is an outstanding lightweight trail shoe. great support with lots of flexibility in the sole. I needed to order a half size larger than what I normally get my running shoes in.
4,Great work shoes,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought to wear to work and I am in them for at least 11 hours per day. The inner soles gave me foot odour, so the merrel breathable mesh lining is not the case. I threw these out and replaced them with innersoles, no foot odour problems since, never had foot odour from any shoes and when I am not wearing these I am in runners. So..... Cheers"
3,Merrell Spire Stretch,"These shoes are nice, however, the fit is way too small! I got a half size larger than what I need and it is still too small. I recommend getting a full size larger than needed and wearing thin socks. Also, it was said in another post that I read that the arch support is great. I honestly do not agree. I felt the arch, but it was not that supportive. I am returning my pair."
2,Runs Small & Narrow,I have a pretty regular 8.5 foot. I purchased these shoes along with another pair of Merrells. I couldn't stuff my foot in this shoe no matter how hard I tried. Usually all 8.5 Merrell's fit me perfect. This was the first exception.
2,Tired Feet,"I read almost all the reviews for this shoe. I LUV MERRELLS. But, this shoe has a snug fit. I wore them around the bouse with socks to try and loosen them up. Considering I'm on my feet all day, I really needed something that looked feminine and very comfortable. This was not that combination. I luv my merrells, but I dont luv these. These shoes are for going out for a couple of hours and off they come."
3,Runs small,"I ordered this shoe in a size 10. I normally wear a 9.5, but ordered a 1/2 size up to be sure it fit. When I received the shoe I tried it on and could barely squeeze my foot into it. I couldn't believe a size 10 didn't fit. I had to return it so I didn't get to actually wear it. The shoes appeared to be of quality construction, but unfortunately they did not work for me."
4,Comfortable,These shoes are very comfortable once I get them on. Having a previous ankle injury causes getting these on to be difficult. I love them other than that.
2,Outrageous shipping costs!,I love these Merrell shoes and it was great to order them online but unfortunately among the choices I was not paying close enough attention to the shipping costs which were excessive.
2,Merrell Spire,"This was the first merrell shoe I have ever purchased that was not true to size. Fits very tight and is very narrow, though it said medium fit"
3,Gave 3 stars--Hope they'll end up a 4,"This is a provisional rating as I haven't given them a full workout yet. These are more tailored looking than most Merrell shoes, which is a plus, and if they're not gorgeous, they still look okay with pants. This seems to have come at some cost, though: The silhouette is a bit narrower (which, really, is the whole point) though that makes for slightly tighter fit. Things may loosen up, but so far, for example, that even affects getting them off and on. Also, they are less well cushioned, which is quite important to me, and the cushioning is why I have bought the other three pairs of Merrills I own. So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed, that the shoes don't sacrifice too much comfort for, say, extensive city walking in exchange for being not too bad looking."
3,Functional but not so flattering,"The shoes are very comfortable but I don't love the way they look Having said that, they work for me very well and I'd certainly buy again."
5,Finally a shoe I can wear all day despite my plantar fasciitis,I have found that one of the few shoes I can wear since developing Plantar fasciitis (an inflammation of the thick tissue on the bottom of the foot) are Merrell Q forms. This Q-form shoe is stylish enough to wear to the office and yet comfortable enough to be on my feet all day. Thank you Merrell for your Q-form technology.
1,Did Not Last Through the Season,"For the price, I expected these shoes to last for years. They started looking worn out after just a few weeks, and the heal wore down after about one month of use, so that they became dangerous to use."
5,Awesome!,I am not a big fan of Hamburger Helper. But my sister in law made this one night and I could have eaten the whole pan. She cooks per package directions (sans the cheese sauce) and then places the cooked product in a casserole dish and tops with shredded cheese. Bake for 20 minutes ( or when cheese melts)at 350 degrees. We eat ours with Tostitos Hint of Lime chips. This takes a little longer to make but worth it.
4,Great relief and results,"I was definitely concerned about buying this product due to the many reviews that seem to be either paid or from the company itself. Overall, this product does work. It doesn't work miracles but it is of good quality and provides a fast recovery and good, self deep tissue massage. Yes, you could make something similar for cheaper, that is why only 4 stars! If you are on the fence and have the money, I would get it because it will last you a lifetime. If you will be breaking your bank, use some old glass coke bottles in a sock and a lacrosseball and you have a very similar product. Cheers..."
4,Promising Guide to Being a Better Father & Husband!,"After reading Being A Dad by Dale Alderman I was impressed by the important message behind this book. Dale shares embarrassing, humorous and entertaining true life-testing stories that he has experienced with his family. Over all Dale offers advise using tales that will have you laughing out loud on the subject of being a better husband and father. This would be a great gift for any father, father-to-be or anyone who enjoys amusing tales!"
2,"Convenient, Poor Customer Support","The Minolta Dimage X is a neat little camera almost amazing for it's size. The camera is easy to operate. When it came to downloading the photos to my computer, Windows 98 second edition, that's when I had a problem. I could not load the USB driver and after almost an hour with Minolta technical support they couldn't load the USB driver either. The solution they gave me was send the camera back to the supplier or to them or buy a card reader. I am purchsing a card reader so hopefully that will work. A friend who has Windows XP and another Dimage X camera had no problems with that operating system."
1,Do NOT buy this camera used,"After my first beloved Minolta Dimage X Camera was accidentally lost last year, I really wished to have another, as this camera took some of the best, clear, and beautiful pictures of any digital camera I had ever used or seen. I also never had a problem with it, so I looked for and purchased not one, but two used Minolta Dimage X cameras from two different Amazon sellers. The first camera's shutter button jammed after around 100 pictures were taken and no longer works. The second camera took nothing from day one but foggy, blurred pictures whenever the zoom lens was even slightly adjusted, and the only clear pictures were those that did not utilize the zoom option. And again, after taking only 125 pictures on the second camera the shutter button fell off and it also no longer works.I'm out over $150.00 with two busted cameras and would not advise anyone to buy this camera used. I give this camera and my Amazon shopping experience ""zero"" stars."
1,Cheap plastic battery door - $181,"Cute size encourages leisure use, but beware of the fragility of this camera. I dropped it and broke the cheap plastic battery cover and the tiny plastic battery hold-down tab. Minolta wanted $181 to replace. Seems like a rip-off since these are simple plastic parts and are easily accessible. Poor service."
5,Simple point and shoot camera that captures great pictures.,"Major Features:* Incredibly compact and lightweight camera.* Dimensions: 3.3"" (W) x 2.8"" (H) x 0.8"" (D)* Weight: 4.8 ounces* Fits easily into your pocket.* Unique 3x ""folded"" F/2.8 optical zoom lens* 2-megapixel imager for images up to 1600 x 1200 pixels* Still images stored in JPEG compressed or uncompressed TIFF format* Motion video 320 x 240 with audio at 15fps up to 35 seconds* 15-second audio notes can be attached to images* 1.5-inch TFT color LCD monitor* Minolta's CxProcess image processing provides clear and natural images* 12-bit A/D conversion provides a finer tonal gradation* White balance options: automatic, daylight, tungsten, cloudy and fluorescent* Built in flash with Auto, Red-eye reduction, Night portrait and Fill modes* Audio/Video output, NTSC or PAL selectable* Removable flash memory cards (SD or MMC type)* Epson PRINT Image Matching compliant* Lithium rechargeable battery (~2hr. life) and charger included"
4,USB problems - warning and solution,One other comment - the USB drivers failed to load with my Windows 2000 Professional system. Other reviewers complained about the same problem with Windows 98. But then I ran the hardware wizard and told it to use the generic Microsoft Mass Storage Device driver instead of the one Minolta supplied on a CD - and it worked perfectly.
3,Sand is a killer ...,"Wonderful camera until I went to the beach .... the shutter suddenly refused to open. Although I took great care of my brand new camera, the sand-damage was done and repair not possible according to Minolta."
1,view finder out of alignment,After 2 years the view finder became distorted and out of alignment. Hopefully it can be repaired but there seems to be a lot of used cameras of this model advertised. I wonder why?
2,small is only thing nice about camera,"The only thing nice about this camera is it's size, very compact and light weight.I returned mine for a refund for the following reasons.1)The battery doesnt last long, so you gave to buy another one, cannot use AA if in a pinch.2)Indoor photos are washed out by extremely powerful flash. And it always uses the flash, even in not so low light situations.3) Extremely slow at writing the photo to the SD memory. (about 5 seconds)(this is without flash)4) Buttons are poorly layed out, and menu system not thought out well.5) Movie mode records in MOV format!! forcing you to use quicktime!I returned this camera and got a SONY P72. ..."
4,Small and Stylish.,"Yeah, the image quality is average, but for snapshots and fun movies, it's great. It does look very cool, and it is the smallest digital camera out there that takes movies with sound. This makes it a great camera to bring along to the baseball game, to the beach, an amusement park, etc. For all those videocamera moments."
1,They've got to be kidding!,"Yes, this product is inexpensive. That's because it's cheap! The holster was flimsy, with a snap that didn't snap, and the phone didn't fit in it--at all! The ear bud had a plug incompatible with the D807! They've got to be kidding! I suppose they might have simply loaded the box with the wrong items, but the individually sealed holster and earbud DID say for Samsung D807....I just don't get it, and I recommend you also don't get it."
2,only charger is usefull,Charger is OK.Head phone and the cover are very poor. Not usable at all.Dont go for this. Instead go for just the charger which costs 40% less than this one.
1,Don't waste your $$$,"I absolutely recommend NOT to buy this garbage!!! Earbud is way too big and sound quality is awful, the connect tip to phone charger is so flimsy that the tip will retract itself to the casing won't charge the phone and don't even bother to look at the case. If they offer to give this set for free I wouldn't even take'm. Such a piece of GARBAGE!!!"
4,Well thought out tale of time travel to ancient Ireland,"Similar in context to the Dragonfly in Amber series, this tale involves time travel from modern Ireland to 10th centery Ireland. The main characters are a dominant female Irish professor and a demure Canadian associate instructor in which she is involved. The story begins as John takes a rubbing from an ancient celtic cross. This ""portal"" throught time allows these two wonderfully mismatched people to go to the 10th centry. What is appealing in this story is that it is written with a keen eye to the detail living of both modern day Dublin and 10th centery Ireland. The author has apparently done her homework. I fully enjoyed this book and wanted a sequal that never came. Fortunately the Dragonfly in Amber series was similar in context that scratched that particular itch."
5,Shaving the competition,"This is one of the first products - outside the realm of music and books - that I have reviewed for Amazon. There is a reason for this. Rarely do I come across a product by one company that I consider to be so essential.This version of this shaving cream is the best on the market. It provides a smooth, delicate shave with a nice recovery process for the skin. It is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.I just received a call from my brother and he corroborates the fact that this is the one that takes first prize.This is the only shaving cream I ever buy!Alba - you rock!!!(Go with the lime variety over the others)"
2,Valentine's Gift,Spend more money and get a better quality bangle(bracelet). There's a reason why it's on sell!
1,Very confusing map,"This map is done with a very good material, but it's so confusing. The front page send you to the other side to go south but does not match with the graph. Minus five stars (-5)."
4,Simple and effective,"The benefit of this product besides its effectiveness is that only one softgel anytime once a day is needed. Most other Candida supplements like Candex, Candidase, CandiStroy, and several others MUST be taken on an empty stomach and more than once a day. If you have long-standing, pervasive Candida overgrowth, you might want to supplement this with yet another anti-Candida product. I especially like this for prevention and maintenance after a Candida cleanse. I have already repurchased."
4,"The Best of Pulp, Comedy, and the Disturbing","This outrageous, disturbing, completely original and often insane work offers an outpouring of stream-of-consciousness and completely off-the-wall fiction, anchored by the decadent and sometimes perverse title novella. It is not for the faint-of-heart. Nor is it without flaws--but much of it is immensely fresh and readable."
5,"NIce, portable swing","This is just what we needed. Our son has acid reflux so he spends a lot of time sleeping in his car seat and getting swung to sleep in his seat. This is a pretty gentle swing, even at the highest setting, so it seems to get him to sleep a little better than his nice, Fisher Price swing.The portability of it is a big bonus. We're glad we'll have something other than our arms to get him to sleep whenever we travel.A good tip is to make sure it's stopped before you turn it on, turn it on, and then once you figure out how it's swinging to give it a little push in the right direction. Sometimes it has a little trouble with our big Graco seat and our chubby kid getting going. But once it does it doesn't stop!"
1,Terrible swing,"This swing could barely move with just the car seat in it and wouldn't move at all with the baby in the car seat. Forget about it if you have other kids running around the house as well, it's the perfect height for little hands to poke the baby!"
3,Works ok,"We got this swing with our first child and used it about 12-20 times. It was mostly for trips to grandma's. The problem with it initially was that it was either very slow or fast. It has a dial for speed that didn't recognize a middle ground. But, if you played with it, you could get it to the right speed. Now that we have it with our second child (they are only 13 months apart, so it didn't sit idle for even a year), after only a handful of uses the speed dial is broken. It keeps going after you turn it off and turns itself back on.The vibrating function seems to still work just fine.We are going to get rid of it and not replace it. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if that was an option."
4,Make sure you put the C batteries in too,We bought this swing for our baby who is not born yet. A friend came over today with her almost 7 month old and we set it up for her. WE put the AA batteries in the front and set it moving. It goes for quite a bit but then stops. I got on Amazon and was reading review after review about it not swinging until someone mentioned C batteries. There is another area on the top where C batteries go to work the swinging mechanism. Problem fixed. Motor is loud but I didn't mind it. Just more white noise.
4,Graco Portable Travel Swing,"Some pros are:You can plop the baby in the carseat right into it when you enter the house--gives you some time to remove your coat before having to unstrap the child.It creates its own storage space for the car seat itself when you are not using it (I like having a ""right place"" for my things.)As another reviewer said, the mechanism is smooth and well-balanced enough to use gravity to swing for a while if you push it.Some cons (or noteworthy elements) are:The vibration mechanism takes AAA batteries installed at the bottom of the swinging part.The swinging mechanism takes C batteries installed at the top of the swing arms.I think the vibration is not as intense as the other vibrating products that use only a peice of fabric to hold the baby--it's simply not possible to shake a heavy seat that strongly with batteries. But it seems to please my 9 week old son and put him to sleep. He weighs 12 lbs."
3,"Good place to park your car seat, but not a perfect swing","I purchased this to keep at my office for the days I am able to bring my son into work with me. It was easy to put together and lightweight. I am using this with a Graco Snug Ride 35 Infant car seat and a 12-lb infant.The idea for this swing is great, and I'm satisfied with my purchase for the price, but am not thrilled with how distractingly loud the motor is. The motor also struggles to get the swing moving unless you turn the speed up very high (just remember to turn it down again so the baby doesn't get seasick!).Given that this is the only product of its kind available, I do recommend it to anyone who needs a regular place to park their infant away from home. However, if you are just looking for a general swing to use at home, you may prefer a different product (like the ""Fisher Price Swing To High Chair"")."
2,Portlable swing?,"My two issues with the swing are: first of all, the ad doesn't specify portable and while the photo shows the swing as being low to the ground, I thought I was buying a taller swing. Secondly, the vibration and sound controls are located under the seat, when the seat is on its perch. This means that you tilt the swing upward to select controls, either interrupting the swinging or possibly waking the baby if all you want is vibration."
2,graco car seat swing adapter,"It is easy to set up, but it would be a more useful product if it could take additional car seats. It is kind of expensive for what you get. The baby doesn't really seem to enjoy staying in the car seat ."
2,NOISY... cheaply made,"for the price you pay, its ok. but if you live in america where you can buy many BETTER stuff and not crazy more expensive than this, i suggest you to buy something more smoothly working than this noisy machine! the finishing also very cheap..."
2,Good idea but not as practical as I had hoped,"I registered for this swing because I wanted a swing that would fold up and not take up too much space while not in use. Although the swing has met expectations in terms of being space saving, it does not work as well as I had hoped. I may have received a dud, but I find that I often have to push the swing to get it going. It either does not start swinging properly or slows randomly during use. It is a bit loud as others have commented, but it doesn't seem to bother my son, so I'm fine with the noise. If this product worked a bit better it would be a fantastic swing. Good idea, just needs improvement."
2,Really great idea though poorly made,"I really really wanted to like this. I loved the idea of using the car seat and having a place to store it and the added features were great. I really expected to love this.The problems were the same listed by others here. The rocker was the perfect speed and height, but had an EXTREMELY loud clicking noise and woke the baby every time I tried to use it. It also looked like it was barely rocking after I put my 1 month old 11lb LO in and it'd stop shortly after my DS gained more weight.The vibration setting was great though it wears the batteries down after only a short amount of time each time I try to use it.Basically, I use this to store the car seat in when I get home and just reach over and hand rock it every now and then when my DS stirs in his sleep."
5,Would Buy Again and Again!,"Having already had a small, cute Pooh travel swing for my first daughter that was a PIECE OF JUNK; I took a chance and ordered this frame for my second daughter.I was SUPER pleased with this product. My car seat fits right in it no problem (Graco Snugride) and it looks cute. It is a piece of cake to use and the power is unbelievable.I don't have all the problems with the batteries that others do, though; because I use rechargeable batteries throughout my house. I have two sets for the swing and when one dies, I pop the other set in while I charge it up. Works great.I LOVE THIS SWING! It is WONDERFUL!"
1,Big disappointment,"I was so excited when I initially saw this product on Amazon. We are tight on space, and I loved the fact that the swing would accommodate our infant's Graco car seat, and included songs, vibration and portability. However, once our 14 pound baby and car seat were snapped into the frame, the swing came to a stand still. It would swing on it's own, sans baby and seat, but once the baby was added, it seemed that it was just too much for the motor to handle. I think it would swing a newborn, but we didn't get it until she was a bit older, as our last swing's motor died. I was so excited to try this.. but a swing that won't swing is not much use to me. It's getting repackaged up and will be returned to sender."
1,Poor design,"When I first saw this product I thought it was a great idea. However, after trying to use it a few times I realized that it needs a better motor and design. The swing makes a very loud clicking sound when it's on and it's very distracting. Also, I found that it wouldn't swing at all on the lower settings and the faster settings swing WAY too fast. I was very disappointed in this swing and you should think twice before ordering it."
2,"Great concept, but kid hates it!","I was excited to find this thinking I would save space and I could travel with it. Works great, but my daughter HATES it and screams within a minute of being in it. I'm hoping she'll come around when she's a little older but for now I'm putting it away and ordering a cradle swing. Also it seems a little pricey."
4,Car seat swing,"I really like this swing. I have three kids so when I need to help my older kids get ready, or if i have to finish getting ready myself it is great to be able to put the baby in the seat and have him fall asleep to the swinging motion!"
2,Sooo excited......but so disapointed!,The Graco SnugGlider is very cheap and sometimes works and sometimes does not. The on off switch came defective and can't get the dang thing to turn off without taking the batteries out each time. Great idea but lacks quality! I would not recommend this item.
4,Great for Small Spaces,"If you love the Snap and Go you will appreciate this swing. We live in a small space and it is great to not have a huge swing everywhere. We also wanted a swing that would travel easily. Since the car seat is the seat of the swing, it takes up minimal space in the car. We have really appreciated being able to bring her in sleeping from the car and pop her right into the swing without waking her up. Gives me a free hand for a few more minutes. The only issue we have had with it is that the motor is not as strong as is needs to be and takes a little push to get started, but once it is going its no problem. We have truly enjoyed this product and would buy it again and again. Its is great for small spaces and those who are not ready for baby products to take over their house. I beleive in a year or so this will be the new must have as the snap and go is now."
4,"Great Product, but a little noisy","This is a great product. It is very light weight and portable, easy to use, and a space saver! The only drawback is that it's a bit loud. It makes a clicking sound similiar to the old school swings that you needed to wind."
5,"Indispensible, portable, soothing","This swing is wonderful! The low height is not a problem; it makes it portable. We took it with us on a road trip and it's the only way she would sleep sometimes. She takes her naps in it. I do wish you could plug it in. We had to buy a battery charger and 3 sets of batteries just to make sure we always had fresh batteries for it and then we have to be very careful when putting the batteries in every day. The way the wires are set up, rechargeable batteries don't want to make a good connection. You have to fiddle with the wires to make sure the batteries get a good connection because rechargeable batteries have smaller metal parts on their ends."
3,"It's good, not great","It's ok. The swing is super light and very portable. I have noticed that it doesn't swing consistently. It either seems to go too fast or not at all. Once the car seat is in place, forget about using the controls for vibration and sound. I actually forgot the swing had the other controls because of where they are located. I find that I have to push it to get it going, which isn't that big of a deal, but as I said, the swinging motion is very inconsistent. The other day I started it slow and when I came back into the room it looked as if it was going to launch my 11lb son into space. I actually just use it as a base to hold the car seat and only use the swing motion once in awhile."
4,Crucial for wee ones despite few quirks,"Overall this is a great product and is really nice having especially since the Graco Snugride car seat just snaps right in it. There are a few quirky things about it though. The dial for the swing speed doesn't have numbers on it so it's pretty hard to judge what speed you're setting it to until it's already going. Plus numbers would make it easier to remember which setting you like best so we just took a sharpie and made a permanent dot on the dial. Also, once the swing gets going it makes a somewhat loud clicking noise (probably related to the torque of the arms?).The music is a nice feature and the car seat easily snaps in and out of place. The swing also folds down flat when not being used and the whole thing took less than 5 mins to put together. This was a crucial buy when my daughter was less than 10 weeks old so the little quirks didn't really bother me much since the swing helped her fall asleep!"
1,Dayco No Slack Pulley - False Advertising!!! MADE in CHINA!!!,"Box says Made in USA, but the bearing says CHINA. The ""new"" chinese bearing was already leaking when it was taken out of the box. Save yourself the time and expense of having to redo your work in a few months. Avoid Dayco No Slack/No Truth Pulleys with their chinese bearings. Dayco is no longer a ""name brand"" or American made!"
4,"I love it, I was up and running in under an hour.","I have to admit I cheated a little, I registered my domain name ($12/year) found a host, and set up a (free) paypal account. I can take credit cards and online drafts from checking right away. The Page looks professional, and has everything I could ask for. Watch out for the back ends. There are a half dozen plug in modules that aren't include in the base software, some usefull, some not. But if you want them you pay extra. They do things like import products from a database (you have to type them in manually w/ the base software, (so if you have a large selection, you need it,) support multiple simultaneous languages, and add 3d graphics. You don't need any of these, but if you want them you have to pay extra. I haven't yet, but I'm thinking seriously about that import wizard."
2,"Looks good, comfy, but cupholders dont hold any cups!","Looks good, fits well, comfortable... Would be perfect excecpt the cup holders suck! None of the 4 cupholders will hold anything including bottled water or any size (big or small) cups. The slightest turn and they tumble right out."
5,Should be required reading for parents and teachers,"""The Mind of Boys..."" provides an outstanding insight into the minds of our sons. This should be required reading for all parents and teachers. The information is presented in a manner that it is easy for anyone to comprehend. This book is a great reference tool to help parents and teachers understand how our sons minds work so that we can assist them in their development without destroying the wonderful ""boyness"" that resides within each of them."
5,Good Book!,I read this and it gives great alternatives for boys that are having a hard time in school. I definetly recommend it!
3,Not much help if your kids are older,"Lot's of good advice, especially if you can start early (before you notice any ""problems""). Other than that, you'd have to be ""superparent"" to follow even half of the suggestions."
1,Does not recline or bounce,"A baby bouncer is a wonderful thing for putting a baby to sleep. The daycare where my baby goes uses them and has as many as six babies sleeping peacefully in minutes several times a day. For this to work, however, the bouncer needs to recline and to actually bounce. This one doesn't do either. I also found it fairly useless for holding my young baby because she slumped over--which bothered me if not her. It was useful for a month or so for feeding her before she could sit up and for entertaining her while I took a shower when she could almost sit up. (You are supposed to stop using it once they can sit up on their own.) It doesn't need to fold to do those things. I recommend buying one that reclines or better yet, adjusts. If you travel frequently to the same location, buy two rather than carrying this around."
4,Nice for travel or small homes,"We don't have a ton of space, so now that my daughter is 6 months and sitting up well on her own we've folded it away and put it in the closet. It was very nice and the only problem I had with it was that she could pull the toy bar off. It wouldn't hurt her if she did though, she's just very active. She loved the zebra. In the beginning we had to put receiving blankets around her head to keep it from falling to the side. All in all, very good."
2,"OK, but you can get it much cheaper","Game is fun, if older. LOL, you can buy a surplus CD online for $4.95 and use the electronic manual."
3,OOOO Boy,"This game really pissed me off. While its true that A&A is the best strategy board game since chess, this game still managed to aggravate me. Whenever I would try to play, the game would slow down after a while. It would run great for a while, but after about 10 minutes there was a 1 or 2 second delay on every click that I made. And after 45 minutes it would just crash. If anyone has any suggestions on how to stop the slowing, then e-mail me at StubbsMcGriff@yahoo.comUntil I get this fixed, I won't be playing much Axis and Allies on PC."
2,Definitely not worth the 90$ price!,"I felt ripped off by this book. I bought it because my then research advisor was recommending it for a course. I agree that this is a collection of seminal research papers in architecture. But, any research student with access to IEEE/ACM can easily get hold of these papers for free. Save 90$ by not buying this book, and instead take prints of the papers."
5,These guys are great!,My wife and I met these guys in Honolulu after a live show. Zuttermeister's voice is amazing. I would recommend this to any music lover.
3,Disappointing and a little deceptive.,"When I ordered this CD I was under the impression that somebody had unearthed some rare recordings of the Osborn Brother's early years before they went electric. Not so. Most of the the tracks on this CD are modern studio recordings recreating the type of music the Osborne's were playing during this period. It is good listenable bluegrass, but nothing to get excited about. The two exceptions to this are ""Across The Sea Blues"" and ""Can't You Hear Jerusalem Moan"", recorded during the Osborne's brief stint with Jimmy Martin. ""Can't You Hear Jerusalem Moan"" is, by far, the best thing on this CD."
4,Inspirational.,"I wish more addicts would take their recovery towards a physically healthful path. Todd shows that any addict can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live. The book has a lot of war stories that I am very familiar with and uses them to show that a turnaround is possible for anyone suffering from the disease of addiction. If you are an addict or know someone who is, don't give up. Recovery is possible if you or they want it. Comgratulations Todd. You inspired me to continue on my triathlon path and spreading the word of healthy living. Thanks."
4,as advertised,Product is as advertised. Good value for the price. I would recommend this product to everyone that is looking for a good product at a fair price.
1,Bad quality control,"I've had 5 bad cells out of 24 in this pack. BAD RIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE. I use a pair of these in an LED beacon I hang on the dog for late evening runs in the woods. I get maybe a week's use out of a set, and one night I noticed that a ""fresh"" pair still looked nearly dead. I thought by mistake I put one of the old ones back in there? Nuh-uh. Turns out one of the two new AAA cells was nearly dead, and the one remaining good cell was doing all the work. So then I went to the workshop and got my BK Precision volt-ohm meter (any battery tester will do) and went through the rest of the cells and found four other cells nearly dead besides. I have never had a bad cell out of packages of other name brands. Beware."
1,They Leak,"Update: I now have two more flashlights ruined by leaking Rayovac batteries. Do not use Rayovac batteries in anything, under any circumstances."
3,Nothing New From Everclear,"Basically this album is full of material that sounds like earlier Everclear recordings. Same reasonably catchy, radio-ready pop-rock with Art Alexakis's singing amusing as always.Doesn't quite compare to Sparkle and Fade or So Much For the Afterglow.Best song, I think, is the first single, ""Volvo-Driving Soccer Mom"", although there are a few other songs that stand out from the other material.I would suggest that you get it only if you're a die-hard Everclear fan, or, like me, you like their earlier work and are willing to give this a chance.I give it three out of five."
5,More Great Music From Everclear,"This was suppose to be the album that saw Everclear settle into the typical rock sound, and fade from the front lines of the music industry. But after hearing Everclear's 6th release from Capitol Records, it is safe to say that Everclear will be on top for years to come. The songs on this album are not only well written, but also recorded with real heartfelt emotion.Volvo Driving Soccer, Science Fiction, A Beautiful Life, and White Noise all stand out as pure Everclear mixing instruments, like only Everclear can.There are no filler songs on this album, so expect twelve great new Evearclear songs on this album."
5,Don't miss this one...,"This is one of the better albums I have litened to of late. Each song has it's own, powerful vibe and uniqueness. Each song sounds different, and gives you a different feeling, yet, they somehow managed to make it all work together. This album ranges from Rock to Pop to Grunge, and many others. From songs like the rockin' ""Blackjack"" to poppin' ""Volvo Driving Soccer Mom"" to slower and calmer ""Science Fiction,"" this is a great album, and, though, not everyone will like, I think that most people out there will have the urge to check out this album. Included on the CD are the ""Volvo Driving Soccer Mom"" video, behind-the-scene making of the record and video, and a connection to listen to some ""B-side"" songs. Last time I checked, though, I could not listen to these songs."
4,america's last real rock-n-rollers score again!,"Art Alexakis and the boys return to tweak the American landscape with their tried and true guitar, bass, and drums line-up, crunching smart lyrics with grinding instrumentation. Though it may be impossible to top the hard-rocking/minimal production of ""Sparkle and Fade"", Everclear infuses some synth and strings, used frequently in ""Songs from...Parts 1 and 2, into this album on a few songs. Now that Alexakis has purged more of his personal demons through ""Songs from an American Movie, Part 1, the band came storming back with the underappreciated, ""Songs... Part 2. Now Everclear is back ripping away the veneer from the shallowness and mindlessness of American society, with great songs like ""Volvo Driving Soccer Mom"", ""Science Fiction"", ""TV Show"", and ""The New York Times. This album deserves better than the 3 stars Rolling Stone gave it, this band is one of the last to tell things as they really are, and rock while their doing it."
5,Another Classic,"This is the band that saved my life. This is the band that changed my life. This is the band I turn to when no one understands, and it reminds me that I'm not alone. If you've ever felt lost, confused, weird, and can still have a sense of humor, Everclear could be this band for you. Whatever anyone says, this band is amazing, this album is amazing..."
5,dont judge a book by its cd case.,"Everclear rocks. Their first three were pimp and the previous two were good if you were more into pop.Their new one, however, had me worried. But its ok! As usual, i had to listen through the cd twice to really appreciate the songs. And if not for the songs (sick arse lyrics by the way) themselves im a fan because of the integrity and authenticity of the band. Hey, it's like Craig Montoya (bass, vocals) said, ""we dont really stress too hard on writing the big hits, we're just making the music we want to write, and play, and record."""
1,They really missed with this one.,"What ever happened to Sparkle & Fade or So much for the afterglow? This album is nowhere near what Everclear is capable of. Any real everclear fan out there knows that. I am starting to worry that maybe the run has ended.The songs on this album sound like they are trying to re-create all of their old songs, but they don't work.If you are thinking of buying an everclear CD for the first time, PLEASE don't buy this one. Start with Sparkle & Fade then go to So much for the afterglow. The only other one you really need to listen to after that is there first one...World of noise. Everything else is not nearly on the level.The fact that I read 5 star reviews on this album shows me that there are many people out there that claim to be Everclear fans but have no idea what they are talking about."
5,This album Rocks!!,"This album proves that Art & the band still rock, even though they've grown up. Buy it!"
2,ONE good song. That's it. Everclear's losing it...,"It's a totally guilty pleasure, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE ""Volvo Driving Soccer Mom.""It makes me laugh, it makes me sing, it makes me dance.Play it right before Fountains of Wayne's ""Stacy's Mom."" It's awesome.OK fine.The rest of the album is such a yawn that you begin to wonder what ever happened to Everclear?Seriously, over the last three albums, they've really only come up with three decent songs...""AM Radio"", ""Wonderful"" and ""Volvo...""Hey, their greatest hits album is terrific...but these last few separate albums are only for the rabid fans who'll like anything they put out..."
2,Mostly Redundant Information,"If you have read ANY other material about starting a business, and/or the business of professional organizing, then this book (which is actually a printed Word document in a binder) may be a waste of time and money. It rehashes basic business formation and marketing principles (which are covered in with more depth and accuracy elsewhere) and gives little information on actually doing the job and setting the policies of a professional organizer. The templates are pretty standard (why include the standard fax cover sheet from Microsoft Word?) and not well-designed. If this is your FIRST foray into this area, then fine, but I'd recommend Cyndi Seidler's manual instead, which has more info. about doing a needs assessment."
1,"Unprofessional and, evidently, Unorganized","Do not order this guide. I ordered it through Amazon and realized it was coming directly from the seller. I paid extra postage to have it delivered on time but it never arrived. When I contacted the seller and explained the problem (and by the way my credit card had already been charged) I received no response at all! Then I went through Amazon and the seller told Amazon, not me, that it was delivered by the US postal service and that I should make sure I'm in town to receive it! Yes, the seller actually is blaming me for the inability to fill the order. When I asked for the tracking number I once again received no response. Why withold a tracking number unless it doesn't exist in the first place? Interesting that as I write this note the guide is 'not currently available' or something to that effect. The truth is it wasn't available in November when I ordered it but the seller happily took the order and my money!"
3,Text better than photos,"I am having a hard time getting through this book - a difficulty I don't usually have with decorating books. The text carries some helpful insights, but the photos are admittedly just not my type of decorating - and I prefer to enjoy photos as well as design ideas."
2,Bad Bad Bad Bad,"This tpb illustrates everything that was wrong with comics in the 90s and very early 2000s: dull story and tired cliches. More modern interpretations of Doom have him exhibiting the mannerisms we know and love in an amusing and usually refreshing way, but this tpb's Doom's dialogue is so utterly cliche and boring that I actually did not care about what Doom was doing or what would happen to him.That has never happened before for me if Doom was involved in a story.The plot makes no sense. Doom has somehow been transported to a world that Reed Richards' son managed to create somehow, and random things happen, most of them revolving around various factions trying to kill the good doctor. But it's done in such a bland and unexciting way that I couldn't bring myself to care about any characters in the book.Pass on this junk. It's a disgrace to Doom's glory."
5,"5 STARS, BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE IT 6.","NEXT TO ""THE BEST OF TONY JOE WHITE"" THIS IS MY FAVORITE TONY JOE CD. IF YOU LIKE BLUES GET THIS, IF YOU LIKE SWAMP ROCK GET THIS, IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY GET THIS, IF YOU LIKE POP GET THIS, IF YOU ROCK GET THIS. THIS CD HAS IT ALL AND PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY BY MR. WHITE. FROM THE FIRST SONG, THIS CD CAPTURES YOU AND DOESN'T LET GO. AN AWESOME CD, YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
2,weak compared to previous albums,"This latest TJW album was a real disappointment for me. I love his 1991 album ""Closer to the truth"" and his 1995 album ""Lake Placid Blues"". Both these albums were only released in Europe. This latest album sounds like other tony Joe white songs just with other lyrics. ""Gumbo John"" sounds too much like ""Steamy windows"" and ""Going down rocking"" sounds like ""Undercover Agent for the blues"". You better spend your money on his ""Closer to the truth"" album of 1991. TJW doesn't get any better than that CD."
3,Can't use it as a lunch container,Positive:- the vent provide convenience when heating up the food.- made from sturdy glass material.- easily cleaned.Negative:- food from one compartment can mix with the food from the other compartment- not very portable to bring to the office for lunch because it's too wide to fit in most cooler.- too flat to put enough food for a lunch meal because you can't top it off or else it spills to the other compartment unless you bring dry food.
5,Good to stor and good in the microwave,"The dish is just big enough for leftovers, and goes right into the microwave. Plue no sause stains because its glass"
3,Editing Hampers the feel of the story....,Received in good condition but too many missing storyline....
1,Its NOT THE ORIGINAL !,I am in love with this soap opera; but the only thing is many important scenes are not shown. I had bought one before at another website but i lost it so i decided to look on amazon & no its the real original one. I will sue the cmpany for selling an illegal copyright .
5,Excelent,"Excelente producto, buen empaque ,buenisima calidad , muy recomendable para los amantes de los buenos videos. Como un plus encuentras mas informacion como detras de camaras, bloopers entrevistas y mas..."
1,disappointed,wow so disappointed lots of good scenes skipped seems like its just going to fast love this novela but its just not worth watching with all those skipped scenes
2,I returned it.,"The Quality of the Dvd was great. But every episode had scenes missing or, they were not complete. It arrived on time, and nothing was damaged. The fith dvd that has bonus features was not working properly."
4,Comentario sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Pasion de Gavilanes,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd de Pasion de Gavilanes, contiene un Buen Resumen, a pesar de que le faltan numerosas escenas de la Telenovela, pero dentro de todo Esta Bien Editado.Tiene una Duracion de 12 Horas de Resumenes con las Mejores Escenas y Material Extra como Bloopers, Detras de Camaras, Entrevistas, Videoclips de las Canciones y mucho mas... Recomendable!!!"
3,pasion de Gavilanes,i loved this series. unfortunately by the time I found it was been aired for about 60 episodes. i'm trying to get the entire unedited package subtitled in english. however from what I've been reading the package that's on the market consists of only 5 videos for a total of 12 hours including interviews etc.....that is not enough to give it's due respect to the series.i think a full unedited package for a such program should be available. it's one of a kind and many people would like to include it in their precious libraryPasion de Gavilanes
4,very good,i started watching this program one tv i started in the middle so it was good to see how it started.
2,Good but incomplete,"This is a good review of the actual show, those that have seen if and remember a few of the scenes might end up disappointed that it's missing a lot of the parts that make this show what it really is. Other then that the extras are interesting and the videos worth watching"
4,Missing scenes/ escenas removidas,"Excelente novela, pero me di cuenta que los editores removieron escenas que servian de transicion de una escena a otra. Hay discusiones, romances y conversaciones que se vieron cuando la novela fue vista en TV, pero no se ven en el DVD.Excellent novela but I realized that the editors removed scenes that were transitions from one scene to another. There are discussions, romances and conversations that were shown live on TV, but are not shown on the DVD."
3,pasion de gavilanes.,es una pena que una novela tan buena le hayan cortado bastante .de por si la telenovela es larguisima y al hacer un resumen cortaron todas las escenas.al haber tres parejas cortaron todas las escenas romanticas de estas.me arrepiento de haberla comprado. el resumen es malisimo .no la recomiendo.
1,Terrible,Alot of scenes i was looking forward to seeing were missing ..i spent my money on nothing ...did not enjoy it
1,Appalling,"I was furious when I put in my DVD and then of course went back and read other reviews too late. I have watched some of the show and was dying to see the rest and what I got turned out to be a very long movie trailer. You get little snippets from each episode with all of the really great scenes removed, just enough to give you an idea of the plot. I cannot believe that with a show this popular they would not release to full thing on DVD, and I would love to know who thought that this summarized version was a good idea. Do not buy this unless you are a die-hard fan that has already seen every episode, not worth the money!"
3,"La novela es buenisima, el dvd no/The novel is good the dvd not so much","Cuando vi esta novela en dvd, la compre sin pensarlo. Estaba bien emocionado... Pero cuando la empece a ver me gusto pero editaron muchas partes. Editaron tanto la novela, q cuando aparace dinorah la antagonista principa, no se sabe de como la conocieron..."
1,Pasion De Gavilanes,"I am so very disappointed. I was about to purchase Pasion de Gavilanes but I am glad I read the reviews. I don't understand why not sell the ""Novela""in full in the DVD version! That shows very little respect for the public. Thank you for the alert!"
3,Telenovela Pasion De Gavilanes,"La novela debería estar completa ya que es demasiado buena, deberian sacarla completa en DVD original o mejor aún en los nuevos blue ray"
3,Good but mejorable,"This item is more long but others but sometimes looks like a person who take the soap opera in film and with the scissors do cuts and put one but one. There are some scenes that are very short. I can see it because I saw it on TV, but some scenes can be understood without watch it on TV"
4,Terrific twists and turns,This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!My first Spanish soap was called ROSALINDA and it's awesome too!Only problem is that there are 5 discs and I thought that the last disc did not have English subtitles so I had to guess the end of the story by watching just the acting. Turns out the English Subtitle ON is buried in one of the bonus material so I turned it on and watched it again with english subtitle.Music soundtrack is wonderful.
4,"***DO NOT READ REVIEW FROM AUGUST 24, 2000***","The purpose of the present post is to caution those reading reviews of Fielding's ""The Deep End"" against one, in particular: ""A DECENT BOOK"", written by ""A CUSTOMER"" on 8/24/00... it contains a massive spoiler!---Edit(5 years later): Really, Amazon?? You still haven't deleted that review?! Netflix does a better job protecting its members from spoilers! Thankfully, I tend to read books *before* reading reviews; however, for you normal people who read reviews first, I will leave my original post."
1,"Her worst, for sure!","I've read most of Fielding's books, and I happened to find this one at the library the other day. It's an oldie, but figured it would still be a great read, like her more recent books. WRONG! One of the most boring books I've EVER read."
1,Did I read the same book?,"I am shocked at the other reviews for this book, there was nothing scary about it! It moves much too slow with little or no action. It is more about the lead character, Joanne, and her relationship with her husband and her best friend. The phone calls are only a very small part of the story. The only reason not to read this book with the lights off is so you don't fall asleep!"
1,Disgusting,"I closed the cover on this book and returned it to the library after finishing only the second chapter. The scene with the eleven-year-old daughter catching her mother in the bathroom was revolting. How can a woman write such disgusting filth? Aside from that, the story in itself (what little of it I read) wasn't even well written in my opinion (as a writer myself). It seemed too light and intending to be amusing, not at all suspense. If this book could have been given no stars, it would have been a more appropriate rating. Disgusting."
4,The Deep End by Joy Fielding,"The Deep End is one of Joy Fielding's earlier works. I love all her books- they are always filled with suspense. This book is no exception. I haven't finished reading it yet, but I'm enjoying the first third...and look forward to the shocker she always has at the end. If you are looking for a great read by Fielding try Mad River Road...."
2,The cover is deceiving,"This book was OK but it is more about Joanne's relationships with her husband, daughters and best friend Eve. The phone calls from the person who wants to kill her is a small part of the story. There is very little suspense in this book. And it is far from scary!! If you like a book about how women cope with the breakup of a marriage this book is for you, if you want a thrilling, suspenseful book then forget it! You'll be disappointed."
2,I like the design not the size,"I like the smooth, light plastic frame and I love the snap on canvas holder - and that it stretches the canvas in all directions. But I think this size is a problem. At least for needlepoint where we need to lay the needle flat to start or tuck thread ends, there is just no room to work with. You would have to unclip the canvas each time. I bought extenders to size this better and a 8x8 should work pretty well for a 5"" project. But 6x6 leaves very little space inside, about 4 1/2 inches each way at best and that is not a lot."
4,Too small.,"I like the idea of these frames, but the 6x6 frame is really very small. I think the 6inch measurement must be the diagonal length. It is hard to use on anything larger than the frame as the fabric folds over underneath making it hard to stitch as you constantly have to be moving it out of the way. I would like to buy one of the larger frames as the frame itself is nice and lightweight. The snaps also do not rotate very easily to slide your work over, and you have to completely take it apart in order to move the fabric even a couple of centimeters. Hopefully the next size up will be more useful."
1,Victorian Filigree Barrettes,"I was extremely disappointed. In the pictures they looked exactly how I wanted them to be. Stunning, and in person they were equally as stunning. However, they are much too thin, break easily and the workmanship to weld the clip in the back to the barrette is shoddy to say the least. I never got to wear it as it fell apart immediately upon trying to clasp it the first time. I will never buy another like it, its a waste of money and a huge disappointment!"
4,Great instructor and series,Lara Hudson is a wonderful instructor- and I love the 10 min solution as it makes exercise accessible and easy for all. Everyone has 10 min!
4,A solid work out for beginner to intermediate excercisers,"This workout was about 45 minutes - broken up into a short warm up, about 30 minutes of weights and toning with a few cardio bursts added in, an abs/core section and stretch/cool down. I've been excercising for about 15 years doing various kick-boxing, step aerobics and interval training. This didn't totally exhaust me or have me dripping in sweat, but it was a good general toning video. I initially did the video with 5 pound weights, but will move up to 8 pounds next time. I've done Insanity, Cindy Whitmarsh - 10 Days to a Better Body, Jillian Michaels, and Tae Bo for cardio. This video isn't that kind of heart racing cardio, however the moves are well- cued, Erin is easy to listen to and the routine is well rounded. I will keep this in the rotation for my in between toning days."
4,Great Overall Workout...Not So Great for Bad Knees,"This workout video works on every part of your body and gets your heart pumping. My entire body was sore after that first workout. The instructor is easy to listen to and the video gets right to the exercise. This workout is not for those with bad or weak knees. Sadly, I can't use this video because some of the exercises just kill my knees. Take heed. She suggests two 5 pound dumbbells to start off with, but for those who are just beginning to exercise, try 3 pound weights. I thought it was a pretty tough workout, but she encourages you all the way!"
3,"Disappointing Quality and Support, but Scrabble's Good","The game is slow and the interface is clunky. The game also fails to notify the player who makes the last play what the final score of the game was. When they recently released a new addition of the software they failed to fix this major bug, and didn't add any features that added value to the game. All the Scrabble game play features are there though, and it can be a good way to keep in touch with old friends. I give the general Scrabble game four stars and the interface two stars, for an average rating of three."
5,"Great game, too bad it no longer can work (please read on)",The servers that supported this game are shut down and the game will not function without them. Sad.
1,Game was fun- don't expect any support,"Despite the fun I had with this game, the support has been so awful that they lost almost all of the stars. I downloaded the game and they never sent me a cd rom. Since then I have lost the game to a computer virus. I have e-mailed to enquire why I never received a cd. I sent that e-mail almost 2 months ago. I have since sent three more e-mails. I have still not heard from them-and at this point I really do not expect to. It seems to me that the money I spent is as good as gone. Be warned! If you ever need support I can pretty much guarantee you will not get- and if you do, I would appreciate knowing your secret."
5,Little drops of wisdom...,"A sweet nothing of a book that says much more than its size would seem to allow. We need this kind of thing fed to us daily, spoonful by spoonful until one day we get it. Oh, maybe we don't actually wake up, as Freke so earnestly wishes, but perhaps we can stop dreaming such sad bad dreams. Life is a dream and we do dream it. Death is waking up into another dream. And on and on for the eye-I-watcher in each and every one of us (and I don't exclude all other forms of life) is eternal. And eternally dreaming. I wonder, is Timothy Freke aware of Seth?"
1,Garbage,"Reading this tiny book was probably the biggest waste of time in my life. What a load of garbage. There is nothing enlightening, interesting or remarkable in this book. The author just spews a weak regurgitation of the same metaphysical mumbo-jumbo that you probably pondered and discarded as puerile nonsense as a pre-teen. This load of crap was merely a smokescreen for the author to meekly implore us with the oh-so-enlightening request to ""all just get along"".If I could give this book zero stars I would. The author wasted a half-hour of my life with this pretentious piece of trash and if I ever saw him on the street I would punch him in the throat for it.The people giving this ""book"" 4 or 5 stars are either joking or pretending they ""got"" some meaningful message out of this to avoid feeling awkward for not ""getting it"". Give it up folks, there is nothing to ""get"" from this steaming pile."
5,Magical,"This is a truly magical book that took me to a deep place of 'knowing' lurking deep within me. Deep, original, funky, concise.Being new to these kinds of ideas, this was a fantastic, awe-inspiring introduction.The only problem I had was getting hold of a copy."
2,Meh. Nothing new here for readers of other spiritual books.,"If I had never read a single book about self realization / enlightenment / reality, this might have been a nice introduction. However, I have, and this book was a rehash. The ideas weren't even presented in a particularly coherent way. Friends of mine love this book and the author and I really wanted to love it too, but can't see what all the fuss is about. There are certainly better books out there on the topic and I will not be hanging onto my copy of this."
1,Nothing that hasn't already been said before,"This is a rehash of Charles Tart, Wayne Dyer, and a host of others.Nothing at all new. What is new is that someone can put out something the length of an article and call it a book. And charge for the price of a book. Just for the heck of it I let a friend read it, who hasn't read this stuff before and NO it did not turn her world inside out. If you have never heard this stuff before it is way to short to convince you. If you have read it before, no need to read it again. Many other people have said it better."
4,You Want This Record,"This is one of those albums that you cannot quite understand when you first listen to it. Some people lacking in substance and artistic sensibility blow it off as pointless noise. I however have greatly come to appreciate the ingenuity and unique edge provided in this collection of avantgarde jems. 'As Black Pants Make Cat Hairs Appear' is one of my favorite songs ever written. I would not even begin hesitating to say that this is Joan of Arc's finest record. If you are tired of the same old indie-garbage floating around out there, pick up this record and trip out on its majestic beauty and chaos."
1,Experimental post-emo with low listenability,"I really liked their style in previous albums, but it seems to me that they've overstretched the conceptual side of their music so much that they've abandoned the idea of creating music people actually like to listen to.After listening to this album a few times, i started to wonder if it wasn't just some big joke that i wasn't in on. Unless you're a diehard fan, or really into experimental music for its own sake, i would recommend saving your money."
1,how incredibly horrible,I am listening to this cd at this very moment to remember the anger it brought to my ears. This cd should be illegal to make in the US. Thank God in Heaven that the words are given otherwise you wouldn't know what he was saying. It is called enunciation and they have none. This is the worst kind of emo music that can be produced. The words are complete nonsense and their is absolutely no melody at all. There are sudden pauses for no reason. They took a big chance at something new and failed miserably.
1,DVD Magnum P.I.,"Delivery came in time and good shape. In contrary to other deliveries received from U.S. these DVDs are equiped with a Regional Code Enhancement (RCE) for Region 1 (Canada and U.S.) to prevent these Discs to be played by DVD players from other regions. So they can be therefore useless in Europe, because Europe is Region 2. A special hint for RCE - Region 1 only should be given clearly in the product description."
1,Be VERY careful with Amazon DVDs,"This DVD, like SEVERAL I've purchased from Amazon has flaws that cause the DVD to skip in numerous places, making it almost unusable.Of course, I didn't watch all five discs within the 30-day return period, so now, I'm stuck with a useless, flawed DVD.I might add that I've tried two different DVD players, and they both have the same result, so it's not the player.Amazon sells junk and doesn't stand behind their product.BEWARE!"
3,Where are the subtitles?,"The first three seasons of Magnum included Spanish subtitles; in season 4 the Spanish subtitles were gone, and it seems this fifth season won't carry them either.The lack of a simple feature such as this one drops the overall quality of the release drastically; therefore, it has fallen from my purchase list. Sorry, Universal..."
5,Still Great After All These Years,"After watching Magnum's Fifth Season, and owning the first four, I'm looking forward to having the complete series. With the backdrop of beautiful Hawaii, the storylines have humor, tenderness and, above all - which is what so many of today's TV programs lack - the deep and abiding friendship and comraderie of Magnum, Higgins, Rick and TC. The stories hold up because there is nothing mean spirited or vicious about these people, and makes you realize that if you are fortunate enough to have good friends, life can be pretty good. Of course if I were directing, the last episode would have Thomas and me walking hand in hand off in the sunset!"
5,keep 'em coming...,I wish a lot more people would dive into Magnum P.I. because it's one of those shows that just keep getting better and better...and what an incredible cast...-
1,magnum p.i. 5th season,the first disc of this season was completely un watchable but i cant return it for a refund so im out my money.think twice before purchasing from this seller.its unfair to be given such a short window of time to view things to see if they are defective when you have multiple seasons to watch.of course you are going to watch them in order and people only have so much time a day to watch.if something is defective it should be replaced period.
5,Classic Selleck!,"If you are a Magnum, Tom Selleck fan, you got to have these DVDs. I am hoping they continue to put out more of the series on DVDs."
5,magnum p.i.,Our son in law was very happy with this as a gift for Christmas. Very easy transacion and am happy.
4,Muy bueno - Lo Recomiendo,"Es casi igual que el DVD, lo penoso es que no sale la aparición de Wisin & Yandel. Por lo demas esta muy bueno. Vale la pena comparlo."
4,Overall Great Game,This is a great game. The thing I like about it is that you can play with people over the internet so if you don't have anyone to play with you can play with someone over the internet.
4,Home Spun History and Humor,"A fun and informative paperback about a lifelong friendship between two Chincoteague oystermen and the ""world"" the shared in the 1900's.Humorous stories about the early life of the partners and their experiences selling oysters in tough times. It gives the flavor of living amd making a living on Chincoteague Island Virginia and of the early settlement on Assateague Island (now a national Wildlife Refuge and Seashore). I have read many Chincoteague history books and I like this one best."
5,Youth Helmet,"I bought this for my grandson, and I can tell you that this helmet was really nice and well built. I couldn't find a better price either."
2,Little substance,"Unlike her husband, Henri Cartier-Bresson and many other members of the Magnum photo agency noted for their photography books, this book shows nothing out of the ordinary. The cover photo is the best. The rest are on the same level as the mundane pictures running all over the world in daily newspapers. Two stars because of the cover picture only."
3,Lonely Planet could do better,"Since I've relied on Lonely Planet books to travel around Mexico and South America, I thought this book would give me a real ""inside"" look at the food of Mexico. I was definitely disappointed. It doesn't contain any information that I didn't already know from traveling in Mexico and reading Mexican cookbooks. In fact some of the information it did give was wrong - for instance, Salsa Verde is not made with Green Tomatoes - It's made with Tomatillos -a totally different fruit."
1,Who fact-checked this thing??,"This book is terrible, riddled with mistranslations, gross generalizations, and mystifying pseudofacts. A lovely idea, with poor execution."
4,Describing Spoken English : An Introduction,"This is the textbook I have chosen for the English phonetics course I teach. The book covers all the aspects of English phonetics and phonology in an easy to follow style. An interesting feature of this book is Kreidles's approach to differences across dialects of English as viariations on the same theme. The book discusses all of the aspects of English phonology: segments (consonants and vowels), syllables, phonological processes (assimilation, elision, weak forms, etc), word stress, phrase stress and intonation. A summary and a discussion are found at the end of each chapter. There are also several exercises with key in the book which makes it suitable for self-study."
5,Little known gem,"I can't understand why ""The Baker's Wife"" is not a more popular musical; it would be great if it could ever be televised and available on DVD. This audio CD is a 2-decade-old recording with the original London cast, purchased used. It arrived in good condition barring a small crack in the case, and even included the original booklet of cast photos. I would have liked to have the lyrics included in the booklet, but found a good synopsis of the play and many of the lyrics on-line, so it was easier to understand all the words. The songs are often humorous, often touching, always tuneful. I enjoy listening to them. It would be even better to SEE a production."
3,"Not better, just more complete","This British version of the American flop gives us two discs, more dialogue and a far better understanding of the plot than the 1979 American disc. What it doesn't give us are voices as good as Patti LuPone or Paul Sorvino.This is a more complete recording of a show that makes an excellent listening experience if not a wonderful theatrical evening."
5,Stunning Collection!!,"The casual fan of Patsy Cline may think their collection is complete with the GREATEST HITS CD. But they are missing so much by not buying this CD. The first two songs TRUE LOVE and YOU BELONG TO ME have been sung by the greats but never been given such exquisite treatment as by the lips of Patsy Cline. The same can be said of Heartaches and BILL BAILEY. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN LONELY reveals the lush expressiveness of her voice, and on I LOVE SO MUCH IT HURTS ME you can here the pain from her very soul. Don't miss this!"
4,Excellent Songs- but remastering ruins the recording...,"I have all of Patsy Cline's LPs and records. I have a few of her CDs. Some sound okay, but whenever you hear ""digital remastering"" -beware!. Its sucks the life out of the original recording and makes it sound hollow and compressed. If you want to hear how Patsy Cline is supposed to sound, get her on vinyl. Don't waste your money on a cheesy compact disc."
4,a must read for civil war buffs,this is an excellent portrayal of a major phase of the civil war through the eyes of a combat soldier. It lends a realistic battle front perspective I haven't before seen in civil war books. it is a fast and compelling read by an author who almost seems to have been there.
4,Great Tale for CW Buffs and general readers alike,"Bill Keim has done it again! His first novel ""And Youth Was Gone"" was a poignant story of a WWII vet. Thoroughly enjoyable it is perhaps surpassed in its story line by his latest work. ""Sergeant"" is an engrossing tale of a soldiers experience in the Civil War which will appeal to Civil War buffs (historically accurate) and to the casual reader who is bound to find it a page turner. I don't usually pick up novels dealing with CW but I'm glad I did this time. Everyone will enjoy this book!"
5,"Great for dry, chapped skin.","I really like this product. I had received a clarisonic for Christmas and due to sensitive skin, my face got dry and chapped. I went in Sally and the sales clerk pointed me in the right direction. She said she uses baby wipes to get it off her face. I use a microfiber facial disk.I could be wrong, but you will still feel this on your skin after you wipe it off. I think that's the intent, to continue to condition the skin.This also takes all makeup off. And the scent is very nice."
5,Best Grill Ever,"This is my third propane grill and the first really good one. Follow Weber cooking directions for indirect heat and proper temperature and time. Your food will then be properly cooked, tender and properly moist. My baby back ribs look like a masterpiece of mahogany art. Use sauce from Rendevous Restaurant in Memphis Tn."
5,Perfect Grill,"This grill works great and is very convenient to cook with.I think it helps to read the manual first, for cooking instructions on how to sear and times.I don't have any problem with the paint. I keep the grill clean and wipe it down with a damp rag after each use.That way I don't get a grease build up."
2,What's the Big Deal?,I bought a new Genesis Silver B Propane and I don't see the big deal. It's not much better than a cheapy from Wally World. It's very heavy and very hard to clean up after cooking on it. It cooks hamburgers and steaks just like the cheapy so I don't see what makes it worth 3 times the price. Maybe the warranty? Could someone enlighten me?
2,Paint chips in your burgers?,"Grill works well but the paint on the inside cover peels off in large pieces. It is definitely paint, not grease. Pretty gross. My sister has the same problem."
2,Very Expensive 1-off,"After this purchase I found a (full set) for nearly the same price of this -one- item. Unfortunately it was not sold through Amazon. And about a year later, I found a single like this for half the price. Yes it works and lasted about a year before it had to be replaced again."
3,Talking Murder,"Since the authors were not ones I'm familiar with, it was not as interesting to me as I had hoped."
1,not serious and not relevant; misrepresentations,"Abanes makes fun of serious people he describes as stupids, dummies. He completely ignores the issues that are at stake. I recommend instead books such as Why Race matters (by Michael Levin), Duke's My Awakening, The Descent of Man (by Darwin), Mein Kampf, The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.)"
4,Creating Man,I thought the author gave great discription of the men in his book. The characters could have been any of us. I enjoyed knowing allof them.I hope Michael continues to write another novel.
5,Outstanding!,"This book was an incredible read. The story is brilliantly told, encompassing the reader almost immediately. From the beginning, it stirs emotions within the reader because the author seems keenly intuitive of how gay men emote when challenged by their greatest enemy and/or lover. The story's unusual ending exemplifies the author's talent. I anxiously await another novel by Mr. Cornelius."
4,Lovely lamp,"This is a small lamp for a small to medium-sized desk. The mica shade makes it special. The base is painted metal, which looks cheap, but I have found I can live with it. The lamp shade just manages to conceal the bulbs from direct view when seated at your desk, so glare should be minimal. The underside of the shade is white contributing to even lighting. With incandescent bulbs the lamp will treat you to some alarming cracking sounds as the plastic inner shade lining contracts when the bulbs are switched off (due to the heat). No harm is done, however. Otherwise, a great lamp."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wish I had turned it off in the beginning, but I kept thinking it would get better- instead it just got worse and worse. Not funny at all! One stupid scenario after another and a terrible ending."
1,I Don't & I Don't Like This,"After completing pre-cana classes less than a year ago, you'd figure I'd find some comedy in a movie parody of the process. Instead my experience with this movie started out as a mild amusement for an unusual couple leading the sessions. This amusement quickly developed into an annoyance before evolving into full-blown disgust. Think of Meet the Parents with Robert De Niro having an interest in Ben Stiller's sexual fantasies before revealing his fetish for milking anything with nipples. Over the top comedy usually works better when there is an actual light at the end of the tunnel. It also helps when you care enough about the characters to actually see how things play out rather than wishing you didn't witness the freak show in the first place. This is a film that would seem most appreciated by a teenage audience who giggle at any sexual reference imaginable, while the rest of the crowd is left waiting for the punch line that never arrives."
5,Worms- I've never played a game so addictive!,"In 4th grade my friend told me about this game. I dismissed the idea of worms with guns as stupid. Well, it's taken me four years to notice it and it is stupid. This is a game that sapped away a year of my life. I was glued to the PC without any hope of leaving and i loved it!!! Worms is so addictive that I never put it down. There has to be subliminal messages in there somewhere because no other game has ever been that fun. I found my self laughing as the tiny pixilated pyromaniacs bounced across the landscape. The drowning animation was hilarious. It's so funny, I never realized how sociopathic it was until now. I hate this game. It's like cocaine just playing it once will have you hooked for life. It's an incredibly fun passtime that I just can't handle without becoming addicted. Try it for yourself it'll be the best game you've ever played, but wait until you break the addiction. You'll never touch it again..."
2,Nothing compared to Worms 2,"This game is not as fun as its predecessor, Worms 2. I thought the user interface was too childlike and the gameplay didn't feel right (The Wep. and Opt. schemes are less editable). I highly recommend Worms 2 over this game."
3,Armagedon...more like slap fight.,"I used to love worms in college now, it's just ok. I was excited when this came, I loaded it, played it for about 20min, now I'm over it. It is good if you have never played it but the newness runs out quick."
4,Awesome Old School Memories,"I used to play this game years ago, and bought it just for kicks.It is just as much fun as I remember! A decent single player mission mode, training that challenges even the best player's skills, and AWESOME multiplayer. I used to sit around for hours playing this with 3 or 4 friends, and have enjoyed multiplayer just as much recently. The crazy weapons and funny worm voices make it very amusing!All in all, definately glad I bought it!!!"
5,Prepare to get hooked...,"This game is so much fun! Getting the hang of the game is easy, but to be good at it takes much more time. The characters are hilarious, the backrounds colorful and fun. I really recommend this game. It is fun to set up your own team for your own liking, and play either against a friend, the computer, or on the internet. Go buy a copy!"
4,Earthworms Attack,"I owned Worms armagedon for my gameboy, but i sold it. A couple weeks later, i played the game on the computer. It was six times better!!!!!!! I realy like how the ground can cath on fire. I also like the homing misile."
4,"A great game, except...","This is a really cool game, except for the weapon editor. Worms 2 weapon editor was cool, you practilly made your own weapons. Also, I went to the officail site and it said that this is the last worms game. Since its the last, they shouldn't have made it easier. All in all, I think this is a great game to get if you've also played Worms 2."
3,Great Overview of the Situation,"As a young minister, I did not even know there was a controversy until it was nearly ten years old. I realize that this book was written by someone who would be considered a conservative, but his treatment of the information was factual and kind. He did not set out on a campaign to ruin anybody. The first couple of chapters are very in depth and one could get lost in them, but after that, the material is easier to comprehend and better reading."
1,How Philistines destroyed our denomination for personal gain,"As a lifelong Baptist I am ashamed that someone would write a book glorifying how fundammentalists overtook our convention for their own personal gain. Before the takeover, our seminaries were world-class institutions educating and empowering men AND women to serve our Lord according to their own conscience as led by the Holy Spirit. Now our seminaries are a laughing stock and nothing but glorified bible colleges. All employees must affirm their allegience to the ""Baptist Faith and Message"", a creed that is amended at the convention leader's every whim and is placed above the Bible and Christ as our guide for faith and practice. (The SBC recently deleated from the BF&M the provision that Jesus Christ is the criteria for interpreting scripture-I guess now our enlighted clergy have usurped that role from him). This book is nothing but propaganda from those who stole our convention."
5,Great for kids who love Junie B,My 6 year old absolutly adores Junie B. Santa brought her the Leapter for Chrismas and Grandma gave her the Junie B game. She only puts it down to go to sleep. There are a few games (word searches and finding a Noun/Verb/Adjective and Great for 1st/2nd graders. It is a great learning tool. The software is set up like the Junie B Jones Journal book. If you child loves Junie B she will definetly adore the game.
5,A Great Game for Any 6-to-10 Year Old Girl,"My duaghter received this one for her 7th birthday, and REALLY loved it! She wasn't a big Junie B. Jones fan, but she was encouraged to read the books AND her journal writing grades at school improved as well!I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone with a Leapster and a little girl who is entering that ""Diary"" stage."
1,Thompson's last work... and not recommended.,"Ripoff was released after the great Jim Thompson had passed away, and you can tell. Great writers know what books to release and what books to throw in the trunk, and this is one of the latter. This book is written in a comic style, but it's not funny in the slightest. There is nothing hard-boiled about it either, and neither the characters or the plot is interesting or innovative. Please, put this book down, and pick up any of Thompson's classic works."
5,loving it,loving it all so far not happy how's about just showing me showing it me so i'll have something to review?
1,None of the characteristics of the original!!!,"This was terrible! Much like most of the other reviewers, I count Santiago as one of my favorite books and have read it several times. The sequel however, I didn't even finish. Here's why...the main character is a thief and has been one for as long as he can remember. During one of his exploits he finds the entire works of Black Orpheus, reads them in two days, and discovers who Santiago is...what?! Then he decides that he can continue where Black Orpheus left off and start writing poems about the Inner Frontier. I know this is Resnick's book and he can do whatever he wants, but I think he waited too long to write the sequel and lost the passion (and ablity to develop a story) that he had when he wrote the original. If you are looking for a sequel that will enchant you like the first one, I'm sad to say you won't find it here."
2,Pretty flat,"I loved the original and count it as one of my favorite books (and Resnick as one of my favorite writers). This sequel falls flat and the characters are relatively forgetable. I liked the ending but the trip there was tedious and it seemed like he just wanted to introduce a whole lot of cool characters and then kill them off before they did anything interesting. If you are a fan of Santiago, read the sequel but don't expect too much."
2,"Jack Vance, where are you when we need you?","Feeling like not much more then amateur Jack Vance fan-fic, the return of Santiago has a little charm, and about 150 too many pages. It also has a ridiculously obvious ending, which is a problem, as it is supposed to be a surprise.Mind you, if you pick it up, you will probably be roped into Mr. Resnick's easy natural style. His ability to generate quick likable characters is evident, a skill he shares with the venerable Mr. Vance.His inability to create memorable interesting cultures in a few sentences, or maintain interest past 200 pages (both skills Jack Vance excelled at) sadly outweighs this however, and eventually drags this book down below the 3 star level."
4,Beautiful Album,"I bought this album years ago. Ramsden and Lodder are British jazz musicians. Ramsden is a saxophonist and there are similarities here with Garbarek's work for ECM in the 1970s. It's chamber jazz, slow, melodic and beautiful.I found the track Extra was on a sampler, and I liked it so much I bought the rest of the album. I would recommend this to anyone who likes ECM."
3,Very pretty but ...,"This item is very attractive. However, after I put the nectar solution in and put the stopper in, it all drained out in a few minutes. So, it is just up for decoration."
5,Great quality,"I bought this shirt two years ago, It still has bright firm colors, the printing is like new, It has been washed and dried a lot! The manufacturing quality is great."
4,Good for those new to comics.,"Not the greatest piece of comic book writing, but Geof Darrow's art is unbelievable. If you have read many comics before, the story is just good, better than mid-grade. If you have not, this will get you sucked into the medium.It is like you are reading a great 1980s scifi movie. Overcoat hero that kills religiously turns out to have a dark secret about himself."
2,Hard Boiled,"Interesting story concept, but the vast majority of this is just pictures and action that takes way to long for such a short story."
4,Good Read!,"This book is a good (and easy) read for someone going through the process of change. It shed some light on things for me, and put the process in a better perspective for me. I have been stuck on some things, and reading this book helped move my ""stuck"" points."
2,"Ok, Not so bad but never so good",the product was not so bad but was not satisfied with the price I paid and quality I received. I amm really not happy with this pair of thermal underwears. I feel of being overcharged. I should have brought it from the store next door which would be a lot less cheaper then buying online from them.
4,Very Talented,"I first heard this group live in my former church during a concert service. What I liked and what blessed me was the fact that ""service"" was first and ""concert"" was the latter. Each singer brings a special favor to table making the final serving a gospel buffet! They in my opinion are smooth like The Winans, exciting like Commissioned, but still different enough to display their own unique sound. It is my hope that this is but one the first of many offerings from this talented and gifted group of young men."
4,Evokes the movie's emotions,"While very few pieces on this CD are great works, they do the job of evoking the emotions from the movie, if you have seen the movie then listening to this CD quickly brings exactly the point in the movie when the piece was played into your mind. I'm not usually a fan of Mr. Zimmer, but in this soundtrack he hits the nail square on the head."
2,Hmmmmm More of the same....,"All the soundtracks in every movie since StarWars, and Superman (John Williams) Have been cheap unoriginal modern adaptations of creativity that was already introduced at the begining of the 20th Century.Gustav Holst, Mahler, Aaron Copeland, and Igor Stravinsky are rolling in their graves! The creative evolution in this Soundtrack as well as others in this ""Blockbuster"" Movie category are very Adolescent in their respective artistic genres. The music of Gladiator is nonetheless enjoyable, but I find it truly deceitful to the originators of this style ripoff to call the Composers- Masters! or to call the Soundtrack a masterpiece?This is truly adolescence in the sense that music if it is considered a ""Masterpiece"" should be original, fresh, and doing something new. Music should move forward with glimpses of the past, not entire Motifs ripped off from the real geniuses that created the originals!My honest opinion."
1,Beware! This is NOT the movie!,"I hit the search button after having entered ""movie gladiator"". The very 1st item presented said ""Gladiator"".....but did NOT say it was the musical score instead of the film. Read carefully!"
3,"I would have rather heard Goldsmith, Elfman, Williams, etc.","Umm..........well.........what can I say about it. It's ok, if that. You might find some things that might please you, but not much. It's not very clever. He could have made it so much more interesting. The action parts of it, is practically noise. The brass is a little TOOOOOOOO powerful. I mean, yeah, most action things use a lot of brass. But tone it down a little bit. I mean, I loud brass, in your face stuff. But this is just noise. I would've rather Jerry Goldsmith do this picture. After The Mummy, which was pretty well done, and The 13th Warrior which is a great score, I think he'd be the best person for the job. But oh well, I can't make the decision for who does what. It's ok score, but only buy it if you find a couple bucks laying around that you don't need. Don't waste your money. If you don't have The Mummy, or The 13th Warrior, or Sleep Hollow. You'll get great music out of that."
2,Um...did Holst write this score?,"Ok...I cant be the only one to notice how much of a blatant rip off of the ""Mars"" section from Holst's ""The Planets"" this score is. I have no problem with someone being inspired by a piece of work, but for god's sake dont copy it note for note! This cd rambles on and on...the 2 or 3 main musical themes in this soundtrack just keep taking turns. I thought my player was on repeat, its hard to tell most of the tracks from each other. For the most part they are bland and repetitive. The music worked in the film, but as a piece of work by itself it falls flat on its face."
2,Gladiator Soundtrack,"While this disc may be good sound wise, it is not the kind of music most people will want to sit do and listen to. One or two good moments on the disc and the rest of it I wouldn't give a dime for. As one reviewer wrote, most of it is swill, I agree with that."
3,"Great action music, but the rest falters.","It is incorrect to call ""Gladiator"" an action movie; the drama outlasts the action by several times. this might be acceptable, but not in this case, when the emotional sections of the movie get so long and boring that you know you won't miss anything if you get up for popcorn. And the music is the same. The two good tracks on the CD, ""The Battle"" and ""Barbarian Horde,"" are basically the same song, with a few differences made to accomodate the on-screen action. Hans Zimmer's music is good, but in a ten minute song, the melody lasts maybe thirty seconds, which is unsatisfying, no matter how good the music is."
3,Could have been sooo much better!,"I was disappointed with this soundtrack collection in that it could have been so much better. For a CD that you are going to sell, the producers should have hit the main themes and stuck to the powerful imagery of this magnificent film."
4,Stirring music to match a Sensational Film,"It is unusual to see a film of the scope and power of 'Gladiator' and still think about the music that accompanied the film. The special effects are not the co-star of this film, the music is. Hans Zimmer has created brilliant and ethereal orchestrations, accompanied by the angelic voice of Lisa Gerrard, creates music that invokes the time, place and feel of the film. It combines middle-eastern and classical moods, demonstrating the violence and the sensitivity of the film. Highlights of the soundtrack are the amazing tracks ""Sorrow"" and ""Now We Are Free.""Whether or not you have seen the film, the music is beautiful to listen to. But, it certainly brings back every frame of the film when you listen to it, just as watching the film made me want to purchase the soundtrack."
5,Mystic and emotions,"I was in the cinema with my younger brother, watching Gladiator. I thought, this is just one of the historical movies with lots of killing, butchering etc. I couldn't imagine that I will be crying at the end of the movie... the last movie that I was crying about was 'Braveheart' few years ago... The last music theme in the film was so emotive and, mixed with an excellent histrionism of Russel Crowe, mystic. The last song remains me of Enya's 'Exile' song... it is so fantastic. It sounds like 'New Age' labels, like Terry Oldfield, Medwyn Goodall etc... I suggest this soundtrack to everyone that is emotive and tender person..."
4,Zimmer Holst,"When I first bought this CD I thought I heard a cheap copy of Holst's ""Mars, the Bringer of War"" with a little Charles Ives & Mahler added in. Why not use the real Holst theme? Did it not fit certain scenes or was the timing off? The composer Hans Zimmer must be trying to capture the essence or ideal of using the style of these musical themes rather than giving us a classical recording of them. Therefore the classical section is the weakness of this CD, but the haunting beautiful universal language of Lisa Gerrand with the mysterious dudak playing of Dijivan Gasparryan is its strength. Both of these fine artists capture the tragedy of this life & the freedom of death. To reunite humanity in harmony with the one's you love most. The last song ""Now We Are Free"" explains it all."
4,Is there nothing original in Hollywood?,"I can't believe it! Not only does this soundtrack direcly lift passages from Holst's The Planets: Mars, the Bringer of War, it also uses passages from Wagner's opera The Ring of the Niebelung (with a few notes changed here and there to make it different, but it's still recognizeable-- track 13 is where it's used). If it weren't for that, this would have been a perfectly good soundtrack. Why can't people in Hollywood write their own music anymore? Grrr!"
1,original ? soundtrack,"Beautiful symbioses of classical themes, but also stolen from Wagner's ring cyclus en Parcifal. And in the end a little G.Faure, also Gorecki and Holst!HOW ORIGINAL!"
1,Holst and Wagner resurface in Hollywood 2000,"The very first time I heard the music, it was instantly recognizable - from the melody, chord progression and intensity. This was Holst and Wagner in their latest reincarnations. All of us know that Hollywood in the past had always looked to these European Composers for their Biblical and Roman spectacles,having not had their Hovhanesses and Philip Glasses.The Arabic interludes are also nothing much to write about, if you happen to be an ardent follower of North African, Rai or for that matter, Sufi music.Altogether a disappointing score - as much as the film."
5,The Best Score...So far...this Year,"This was simply a breathtaking score, with original music as well as a theme that is relayed through out the score. The best part of it was the incorperation of spanish, roman, and northern Sahara music, which makes the score very cultural and realist, as opposed to the grand 'ol Hollywood Epic score. It is very beautiful and entrancing, and is a good purchase if you just like good music."
5,The best of the best,"This score is my personal favorite for many reasons. One of them, and probably the main reason is the feel of the music. Zimmer's team with Djivon Gasparyan and Heitor Pereira make the music alive. This was the first time I heard an Armenian instrument, and I liked the feel as well. Another reason is the course the score takes. I'll describe it as ""... A battle and a jouney in a strange land"" (Emperor Marcus Aurelius). This is great music and I would strongly recommened this to any fan of Hans Zimmer and of wonderful music."
5,Strength and Honor,"These two words from the movie ""Gladiator"" best describe the soundtrack as well. The slow, soothing tracks, many of which include very good vocals, represent the Honor. The thundering songs of the action sequences represent the Strength. If you close your eyes, you can picture yourself in the Colliseum, or on the battlefields of Germania. One really gets a feel for this epic film, simply by listening to the music. It is one of those rare soundtracks that you don't need pictures to go along with it to understand what is happening. This soundtrack is very good for inspiration when you are writing, but be careful when driving and listening, your aggressive tendencies may come out! This soundtrack is Maximus, and is a must own for any lover of classical scores."
5,magical moments,"it is. each and every second of it was worth the mony put on it. zimmer's work is magnificent and heroic, just like his latest works such as ""princ of egypt"". his music takes me away to my own dreams, my own secret neverland, with a shocking high voltage, a storm in the making. the soundtrack'll make you feel alive more then ever, as maximus felt when he won his freedom apon ceasar's death, when he aknowledged what kind of rome he really wanted. arabian music, along with ethno chords sweeps redlly scot's vision into real life. you ough it to yourself."
5,You haven't heard anything like this before!,"Hans Zimmer has created a score to last a millenium. From the energetic ""The Battle"" and ""The Barbarian Horde"" to the eerily emotional ""Am I Not Merciful?"", the score serves as a perfect underpinning to the movie, but it also stands on its own as an absolutely stunning composition. Enjoy it now, and enjoy it later, because this score is going to endure. Zimmer has raised the bar for all other film music composers."
5,Another great score from Hans Zimmer,"I really enjoyed Zimmer's work on ""The Rock"" and ""Crimson Tide"", and this one did not disappoint. It is very similar to ""The Rock"" in certain parts with very heroic, rocking beats, but has more (for lack of a better word) sensitive parts to it as well, and they complement each other nicely. THis is a very good soundtrack that captures well the emotions of the movie, and I would highly recommend it"
5,Excellent soundtrack,"Having seen the movie, I was anxious to get the soundtrack. In spite of the quotations from Holst and perhaps Wagner, there is still much originality in this music. Many of the pieces are quite powerful and moving. I especially like ""The Battle"", ""Patricide"", ""The Might of Rome"", ""Slaves to Rome"", ""Barbarian Horde"", ""Am I not Merciful?"", and ""Elysium"". The rest of the pieces serve to tie together the album and to provide some additional ambience, and are good in their own right.The peformance is excellent and well recorded. The album conveys quite a bit of the emotion of the screenplay itself and evokes the grandeur and tragedy of the story and of the Roman times (at least a small part of the Roman times). I highly recommend this recording."
2,disappointed,same commentary as stated above. i guess it is better to record the life performances than hear the whole cd
4,Sweet as a biscuit,"I saw the movie. I bought the c.d. My only complaint is that it isn't long enough! I enjoy listening to the entire c.d. on ""repeat"" constantly. The songs carry the listener through the entire film (really-you can picture every scene-isn't that the purpose?). If you value the music in a film as much as the content of the film, this one won't disappoint you. I knew as I was watching the movie that I would like the soundtrack. Lisa Gerrard's work is absolutely wonderful, ethereal and a wonderful compliment to Hans Zimmer's music. As a collector of favorite movie soundtracks, I must rate this one high on my list. Try it, you'll like it!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"Although the music is good, there is a lot that is not what I hade expected. I was watching the movie when I purchased the CD and I wanted to have the same music on the CD that I was listening to at the time. Not all of the songs that you'd like are on it. Thats my complaint."
3,"Good music, but not a good film","I understand a general need to have music in films. It is especially important to have music in an ""epic film"". In GLADIATOR there are very few lines of meaningful dialogue, so it is even more important. Zimmer is a wonderful composer, but there is something I do not like about this soundtrack. It does not sound very ""authentic"" [as someone else put it]. But, hey, the film did so well commercially that I could be stoned for not liking anything about it...huh-huh"
1,Should've read the reviews before buying single track,"I heard the beautiful track ""Elysium"" on Pandora and immediately went to Amazon to download the track. Unfortunately, and like others have mentioned, tracks are abruptly cut off at the end--extremely annoying.I guess that's one way to force listeners to buy the entire CD."
2,Disappointingly derivative,I couldn't agree more with Amazon's review. Half the time I thought I was listening to Holst or Wagner. Only the last track redeems an unoriginal and imitative score.
4,Grate soundtrack!,"The first time I listened to it I was very dissapointed, but for some odd reason the next couple of times I listened I really liked it. In fact, I love it now! I like how Lisa Gerrard's pieces are mixed in with the soundtrack. It is well worth the money. Make sure that you have seen the movie before you buy it so you will understand the music a little better."
4,Beautiful but not too original,"This score gets maximum points for drama and execution - it's uplifting, very emotional and extremely well done. I think it's Lisa Gerrard's touch that really sets it apart from most other film scores today. Still, that doesn't make it truly original. Zimmer's parts are strongly reminiscent of the Planets (not just the obvious Mars passage, but the whole thing), and Gerrard's parts are not that different from most Dead Can Dance albums. In fact, the final track sounds almost exactly like a Latin version of ""Song for the Siren"" from the first This Mortal Coil album. I really recommend this soundtrack for DCD fans who want more of Lisa's voice, and it's great music to play while you write."
5,From a serious soundtrack collector,"I appreciate, listen to, and collect movie film scores, particularly adventure scores. While not previously familiar with Zimmer's work, I have since come to greatly appreciate this score. It perfectly matches the larger than life quality of the film. It does what it's mean to do; enhance the movie and contribute to the emotional content of what's seen on the screen."
4,Many Worlds....,"Sure, Hans Zimmer heavily leaned on Holst for his score and probably a lot of other pieces as well (just listen to James DeMaers 'Two World Concerto' with R. Carlos Nakai/The Black Lodge Singers/Canyon Symphony Orchestra), but what does it matter? All classical composers have stolen from each other, as do all modern composers. Important is: it is great music and a totally appropriate companion to a fantastic film. Not since 'Dances with Wolves' have I come across such a perfect fit of music and film. Wile listening to the CD over and over again, I really can visualise the film scenes again. And: yes, of course: both films and their music play heavily to our emotions - the hero,seeking freedom and justice, longing for peace and a place where he is 'at home'. I can't get enough - at least not for the time being."
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty let down by this soundtrack. The score was plain and boring. Hans Zimmer usually writes wonderfully worthy music. The theme was weak and held no convincing emotion. It wasn't until track 17 when I started to enjoy it. That's probably the only track that stood out. Lisa Gerrard is a fine singer. However, she gets irritating after a while because the melodies are so arid and flat. The movie was missing here. If you have the movie do not bother getting the soundtrack. It's a real let down."
4,hardcore,"i will first admit that i dont' have the cd, i just heard em play live last night. if the cd is anything like their performance last night it will realy kick. their sound is realy hard and fast, this is definatly one made to blast"
4,A simple Guy,Texas folk music is the best way to describe this one. Catchy tunes and great lyrics make this one a timeless piece of music. Seems to get better with every listen.
3,Simple and well-crafted,"Guy Clark will never be a country superstar. He'd feel ridiculous in music video with a 22 year old female model hanging around his neck. He doesn't sing with an exaggerated country ""twange."" He may wear a black cowboy hat to keep the sun out of his eyes, but I doubt that he would ever wear one as part of a costume. His voice sounds like Burl Ivies.What Clark does well, as demonstrated on Old Friends, is write simple and well-crafted songs. It is as comfortable to spend time listening to Old Friends as sitting beside the fireplace with, well, old friends. Childhood is celebrated in `Watermelon Dream,' `Immigrant Eyes' is a song of gratitude, and `Heavy Metal' is a tale of individualism. Clark follows a valuable (but too often forgotten) rule taught in Writing 101; that is, keep it simple. I only wish that I had more Old Friends like Guy Clark."
4,A tale of love reclaimed through faith,"Janice and Buck's marriage failed ten years ago. Now he has found God and wants to make amends for his past sins, but Janice and their son find it difficult to forgive him and allow him back into their lives. The conflict in this story is very real and human, and the faith element is closely interwoven into the story. If you like Christian romance and stories of healed families, you will enjoy Once There Was a Way Back Home."
2,Laffite's Lady,"Well, I think the IDEA behind this book is very good-- Diana Gabaldon certainly was able to pull it off, and the similarities are there. However, I must agree with several other reviewers: The grammar and punctuation in this book are absolutely ATROCIOUS. EXTREMELY detracting when one must constantly correct the author's grammar.Also-- I believe that Jean Lafitte's name is spelled ""Lafitte"" and not ""Laffite"" although I could be wrong (I've just always seen it spelled with two ""t""'s). The Author might check that out...Hopefully, the author will have her next book checked for grammatical and spelling problems."
5,What's next?,"I have never read a tale so epic, so passionate, so rich in character and content. I can't wait until your next book comes out. I hear it will scare the hell out of you!!! Let's get started! PS under 50,000? You've come a long way, baby!!! Congratulations!"
2,Well.....,"""But did anyone check the spelling and punctuation before this book was printed? While you might see a word or two misspelled in books these days, this one had more errors than you can count. I found this distracting and annoying. For the money this book cost you'd think they could have hired a proofreader. This is the worst printing job I've ever seen. The publisher should be ashamed"". (From another reviewer) I agree wholeheartedly. The lack of editing was so glaring that it made the book hard to get into. If you want a REAL book, try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series."
4,Trip to Old New Orleans,"Laffite's Lady was wonderfully written. The author obviously did extensive research and invested a lot of time and love in this book. As a native of New Orleans, I know the places she wrote of; the plantations were as she described them; the Blacksmith shop is still there and the inscriptions described in the book are accurate; the characters were so well described I could see them strolling through the French Quarter. Her unique writing style kept me waiting from page to page to see what surprises were next. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series; I'm already try to figure out what avenues she will explore and how the characters will interact. While there was certainly romance in the novel, it didn't depend on romance or love scenes to carry it; the story was rich with suspence mixed with history. One of the best books I've read in years."
5,Don't be Ignorant.,"I am Brett Thomas, a licensed tour guide with the city of New Orleans, a historian, and book lover. As I have read many other novels with grammatical problems in the past, I have yet to encounter one so rich in every aspect of the human drama of early 19th century New Orleans. I truly couldn't put it down! I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who is intelligent enough to look past the grammar, and look into the genius that is Susan Elliston. I recommend this book daily to tour participants, and am anxiously awaiting a sequel. Keep up the great work Ms. Elliston!"
5,hi mom!,I still haven't read your book but I heard it was great. I miss you. Lots of love your son david.
5,a must read if your were born in the new orleans area,I PURCHASED THIS BOOK IN EARLY NOVEMBER. I AM A HISTORY BUFF SO THIS BOOK GRABBED MY INTEREST RIGHT OFF THE BAT. IT TOOK ME 4 DAYS TO COMPLETE THE BOOK. THE SUSPENSE AND HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS ALWAYS MADE ME WANT TO READ MORE. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT AS A SCREENPLAY. I WILL BE THE FIRST ONE IN THE THEATRE TO VIEW THIS MOVIE. YOU FEEL AS IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME WITH TORI. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL. JOB WELL DONE SUSAN.
1,"a churlish, angry book that is brazen in its sympathies","Many people have been inspired by the magical treatment of Earl Long in the now-legendary book The Earl of Louisiana. Some authors have thrived in the tradition of the wary reporter trying to explain a larger than life Louisiana legend, such as John McGuiness sucessfully did with his mid-1980s book, The Last Hayride. Nancy Lemann, however, is no Liebling as she unsuccessfully tries to give us a personal glimpse of Edwin Edwards during his 1980s trials for racketeering. A more gifted writer, a more charitable person, might have given us a book we could care about, but Lemann's obvious hatred for the governor stains and sinks this book. Her repeatedly snide remarks concerning Cajuns are nothing les than racist as she tries to give us a world of political deal-making that she obviously recoils from. I have repeatedly seen this sad book in the bins at the Salvation Army, and it's no wonder why."
1,Poor Quality; Knock-Off,"The picture in the description shows the original POW-MIA flag, which is what I wanted. Unfortunately, the product is a poorly printed knock-off. The words ""You Are Not Forgotten"" run together and are barely legible. The guard standing in the tower in the background is a square instead of being a guard holding a rifle. The flag's material is good quality but the printed picture and words are horrible. This product does not look anything like the picture in the description or the actual POW-MIA flag. I do NOT recommend spending your money on this product. I am returning the product and purchasing the flag from a different retailer."
3,you get what you pay for,I have this flag hanging on my wall and it IS NOT STRAIGHT! it looks like an S so if you want quality then spend more money and buy a nicer one.
2,POW/MIA Flag,"When ordering, did not say if it was only one side. What I wanted was a POW/MIA that you can see from both sides. Folks selling this type of flag should let folks know that it is one sided or 2 sided. Sellers need to give information on said item."
4,MIA Flag,The flag arrived very quickly. The material was thinner than I was expecting. I hope it will hold up.
4,Nice flag,Very good flag for the price.......had it for a couple months now......with it flying high on my flag pole in south FL.......this is not an all weather top of the line high quality flag.......but a very good quality flag for the price
1,Unsatifactory,"This flag is NOT for outside use. We flew it only three days before it started to come apart at the bottom. We do live in a windy area, but thought it should have lasted longer than three days. Should have realized, for the price, it would not last outdoors."
3,Very Light - Mirrored Image,"The flag itself is OK for the price. The grommets are cheap and very small for our flagpole's hooks. The flag is only readable from one side, and as a result, looks a bit off flying from a flagpole - though there is no mistaking the flag or its design. For the price, it's OK, and probably best (and more than adequate) used on a wall application indoors. It will look OK if flown - but will probably not hold up long term - and for the price, that's what you should expect."
3,POW Flag,"Lightweight fabric makes this flag suitable for occasional display like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, etc. It is too light for everyday use. However, on those selected days, I proudly display it in recognition of those whose service to this country would otherwise be forgotten."
2,POW/MIA Flag,Thank you . I can see why the were so cheep the silkscreening ran togather and does not look good upclose I will need to look eslwhere for good flags .
4,Not great material but great for the garage.,I bought this product to hang up in my garage. The material it is made of isn't strong and I believe would wear out shortly in the weather. But I recommend this product for indoor use. And its cheap!
4,Not a bad deal for the price,"Not the best flag out there, but hey, at this price not a bad deal. And free shipping to boot. Doesn't get any better than this for less than a five spot."
2,Whatever you do...,"...don't listen to his version of ""Anthem."" If you have the urge to, chew some gum. Or go shopping. Better yet, put in Anthony Warlow or Michael Ball's version. I bought this after being impressed by Jeff's powerful moments on the 10th anniversary ""Les Miserables"" concert. My mistake was quickly realized: he blares everything at the same intensity. When he doesn't, it comes in woefully underrepresented, like his interpretation of ""The Rose."" If you're going to dole out import money, go for someone who can define ""nuance."" I've heard that Mr. Leyton is wonderful as Valjean, but I seriously wonder if he was ready to produce a solo album and dive into a pool with the likes of men like Warlow and Ball."
2,Disappointing,"I am afraid I must disagree with the enthusiastic review given by my fellow N.C.Triangle resident. Although some of the selections were good (Music of the Night, The Rose, Against All Odds and Last Night of the World), I found the other selections to be overwrought and somewhat ""over the top"". If you go for ""big"" voices (I do) I find Sean McDermott, John Barrowman, Anthony Warlow and Michael Ball to be much more enjoyable."
5,amazingly awakened by eleven,"what can be said. Beatiful, Haunting and Brilliant. Like words painting on canvas, whenever its surrealism or abstract art, Eleven has always been creative.Ultimately this is their most complex and perfect piece of work. All of the songs shine and are crafted precisely to challenge the senses of the listener.Music would never be the same without Eleven Get this album now."
3,Turn it up to Eleven.,"Eleven is one of those band names I'd heard and read about for many years, so I picked up ""Avantgardedog"". I admit I was expecting more of a grunge sound from them, but this album is so slick it's more arty/alt-rock sounding. In fact if you've heard Chris Cornell's solo album, it sounds alot like that, since they backed him on that disc. I do admit I like the guy singing more, as many others seem to also, but the girl does a decent job. Overall I'm not sure if this is worth full price, but it's easily worth the penny it's currently going for used."
3,This band could be great...,"But they keep on using Natasha as a lead vocalist. She is a great background singer, and harmonizes with the guitarist amazingly well, but the songs on which she sings are the low point of the album. She winds up sounding like an old woman more often than not. Unfortunately, she sings on MOST of the album. I gave Avantegardedog three stars, however, because ""Verb"", ""What Can I Do?"", and ""It's Okay"" (all primarily sung by the guitarist) are absolutely incredible songs. ""It's Okay"" in particular is amazing. It justifies buying the album all by itself. A few of the instrumental experimentations are worth hearing as well, as is the second track, though I cannot recall its name at present. A good album, but a bit diappointing because of how much better it could have been."
1,Confusing to say the least,"This thing may work, but I couldn't figure out how to use it. It comes with two different software applications that work totally different and it's not clear which one you should follow. Maximum PC said the same thing in their review. If they could get someone to write a decent manual, it may be worth it. Also, when I returned it, Amazon was going to charge me a $100 restocking fee, even though it was sent back exactly as it came. I complained and they backed off."
5,simply amazing,"One of the definitive works concerning the Soviet gulags. It's first hand point of view completely draws one into the thoughts of the prisoners. The utter despair of the situation is conveyed clearly. It is simply awful. The psychological depths of this work are the most intriguing parts, especially how loyal Communists deal with a situation caused by Communists. Reminds me a lot of Jews in Germany, pre-Kristalnacht, and the thoughts and denials that ran through their minds. May the world please give up the idea which is communism."
3,This woman loves communism even after 20 years in the gulag,"This woman remembers so many details and conversations it is hard to believe every word. However, what seems true is that after being in solitary confinement for two years and 18 years in a remote frozen tundra and suffering to the point of death multiple times, she still does not denounce Communism. Many of her comrades do not denounce communism but, even after her ""release"", to where, it is unknown, she speaks lovingly of Lenin. I would recommend this book."
4,Hard-to-find two-fer CD now reissued as digital downloads,"The DeFranco Family's two albums,Heartbeat, it's a LovebeatandSave the Last Dance for Mewere briefly available on this two-fer CD from K-Tel, but with the disc out of print, it's become a pricey collector's item. Luckily, both albums have been reissued at affordable prices as digital downloads. You won't get the bonus tracks included on the CD (""Gee Baby"" and ""Drummer Man""), but you'll enjoy all of the original album tracks at a fraction of the price of this CD on the secondary market. [2011 hyperbolium dot com]"
4,BUBBLEGUM DELIGHT,"Featuring the enthusiastic and infectious youthful lead vocals of Tony DeFranco, these recordings also boast many of the same production wizards behind the Partridge Family sound. This album evokes the simpler early 70s, and the cheer they will bring to you is welcome indeed. Among the hits HEARTBEAT, ABRACADBRA and SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME, there are all of the album tracks as well, including some of the DeFranco's more questionable song choices (GORILLA, which remains a camp classic). You will smile, you will dance, you will remember."
5,DEFRANCOS RULE!,"Listening to the DeFranco Family when I was younger made me feel great. Now I can re-live all the great childhood memories associated with this wonderful group of singers. I have always been, and always will be a DeFranco Family Fan!"
5,A great grinder!,"These are amazing. A friend of mine broke 2 makita 4 1/2"" grinders in less than a month stripped teeth in the gear box. Not so with the 9005b these are a tank and can take the heavy use that others cant handle."
2,Tinted?,"Ok, I had really high hopes for zinc cream. It was hard for me to find any sort of zinc cream to begin with. I preferably would want a white or lotion type so it was sad seeing that it came ""tinted"". If your skin isn't orange, the tint will look funny on you. I'm relatively pale so they might as well made it the color purple because I wasn't going to leave the house with that on!I felt like even though it was ""greaseless"" it still clogged my pores and was hard to wash off.I may come back to it but probably not."
2,Did not work for me.,"Yet another product that did nothing for me. As a guy it was very impractical as the cream is tinted, so it felt like a I was wearing makeup. My acne actually got worse in the few days that I used it because the cream clogged my pores."
4,Give it a try,I really like this product. From the time I first used it-it worked great. I've been using spa products (which I've spent more than $500 for) but this product works just as well if not better!!! It's tinted so in addition to fighting acne it covers up blemishes from old break outs. HIGHLY SUGGESTED!!!!!!! The only problem I can foresee is if you are darker skinned b/c the tint may be too light.
4,Consistently great,"I had the opportunity to see Jules at a concert in Seattle last September and I was just amazed at what a pleasant experience it was to finially see him. Just Jules and his guitar, his expressive voice, his charming stories and his fantastic songs. And of course that funky guitar playing style. It was one of my favorite musical moments. The new album is more of the same high quality lyrics, vocal arrangements, and songwriting that I've grown to exspect. And with Stuart Smith on guitar, well how can you go wrong."
5,Very Satisfied,"Perfect for running!! It's small, cute, the sound is awesome. I love that I can listen to the radio or MP3. The small size is great to take on airline travel as well. The battery doesn't last incredibly long but it's still worth it - it's not difficult or expensive to replace one AAA battery!"
5,Bundled software and fine sound make this a great buy!,"It's rare that you find a product that delivers considerably more than you expect right out of the box, but ...the CW200 128 comes through with flying colors! This neat little player has great sound, it's simple enough that an MP3 newbie like me can learn how to use it in 15 minutes, and the bundled JetShell software makes it a snap to set up your own music library (including ripping songs from your CDs) and then instantly load playlists into the player to take with you. Excellent value, and a lot of fun for the money."
5,try it!,"overall, it is great! I like it very much. The voice recording quality is too good to believe!!The only thing I am not very happy is the FM radio, it sounds like not very sensitive to some weak signal."
4,Belt clip,"Was going to buy but...is there a belt clip? I mean, sure it's great and everthing but when I'm doing decline bench or playing a sport, I don't want it in my pocket or around my neck...I would want it clipped onto my waistband. When I run I'm looking at my watch and don't want to fumble this device while doing that. FM radio seems really neat, but for now I'm looking for a small one (just like this one) but with a clip."
3,Can't store enough tracks in it,"I did not realize you can only store 28 tracks onto a 128 MB mp3 player. I am disappointed in that; I thought you could load up to 50 tracks at least. Otherwise, the sound quality is great, it is super compact, no problem there."
5,Read the 5 star reviews below / They are right on.,"This is my third mp3 player that I have owned and the best yet. The compact size, sound and software interface, all right on track. I had a tech support issue that they helped me work through by email that was handled in fine fashion. The product and service that comes with it..........is Excellent!"
5,Plain and simple,"This product delivers exactly what it says. Thick and thin slices of your cheese. And if someday it breaks, who cares? At this cheap price you can afford to buy replacements!"
2,Worked well until it snapped in two,This was a great little cheese slicer until it snapped in two during normal use. Spend a little more and get something that's better quality-- the plastic is pretty thin.
2,Cheaply made,"I purchased this as a gift, and it worked fine for the first month. After 1 month of use, the plastic cracked and wire no longer stayed hooked. It's not useable but also now not able to be returned for a full refund. I am unhappy with this quality of this product."
3,Works great!,A cheese slicer is something I've never had before. I tried it this morning and it's better then pushing down with a knife. It will get a lot of use from me.
2,Didn't last long,"Owned a similar cheese slicer from Crate and Barrel that lasted me 10 years. This one only lasted a month! First, the wiring loosened, then the plastic just snapped in two. I like the low profile of this tool (doesn't take up much drawer space) but I will be replacing it with something bulkier if that means it will last longer. Would not recommend."
1,Broke within 2 weeks of purchase,"This cheese cutter broke with normal use about 2 weeks after purchase. The plastic needs to be more sturdy. Actually I didn't like the way the plastic bent the first time I tried it with some medium cheddar. I started to use 2 hands to apply pressure on both sides of the cutter. I think it broke when my Wife was using it, or maybe it fell off the counter.If the handle was more sturdy so I could use it one handed it would be great for me. However my Wife didn't like it as much as the usual handheld wire cheese slicer. We're going to go back to that, though I might buy another one of these just to have on hand. I liked it until it broke,"
1,Piece of trash. Just broke in two after only a few weeks.,Defective design. Not strong enough to cut cheese. Bad choice. Might work on very soft cheeses that you wouldn't need a slicer for. If they were 25 cents each and advertised as disposable that might be OK.Life is hard. Then you die.
3,It'll cut the mustard... I mean cheese.,"Had one of these for a couple years with light use until today when it snapped in half. I would say it worked really well at first... then got lost in a drawer and forgotten about for a while. I found it again and it was still in fine order... but after a while the wire just wasn't as taut as it used to be and there was no more ""thick or thin"" it was all about the same. It still worked though so I didn't complain. Today though, a nice block of sharp cheddar got the best of it and the plastic handle snapped in half. I was a bit disappointed, but then, it's a plastic doohickey that takes a lot of strain on harder cheeses and costs under $10 so I could hardly expect it to last forever. I chose it in the first place because I like aspect of using it in a similar fashion to a knife vs. the perpendicular slicers, but I think I'm gonna give the metal type with the roller another go for now and see how that works out."
4,cheese slicer,I've used this product in the past for cutting bricks of soft cheeses and it's fantastic. Most cheese slicers have sharp edges and also have large surface areas which create more friction as more cheese is sliced. The thin wire of this product makes slicing much easier.
2,Wanted great things...,I purchased this based on the reviews. I really wanted to like it and at first I did. That was until it cracked in my hand under normal circumstances (slicing cheese). It would be great if this was solid stainless. Would be worth the added cost.
2,It works as advertised,"It looks sturdy.I used it so far on 2 big cheese rolls(each ~6lbs) and still looking good. a cheaper alternative to a powered slicer.Update 5/18/2012: I used it so far for a total of 4 rolls each between 2lbs and 6lbs times on Mozzarella and provolone, and here how it looks:The plastic handle did not break, but the string is loose, does not cut any more, it's basically useless. I just threw $5, and which I understand; I cannot expect a lot from a $5 device, and I'm on the look again for a good cheese slicer."
4,Nice Cheese Cutter,"So far this cheese cutter has performed as described. For the price, it appears to be a good buy."
2,The cutting wires.,"The wires are loose/stretched,(after one use)like the ones I wanted to replace after using several years. Can the wires be tightened? These were the best cheese cutter/slicers ever, until the wires stretched. We loved them. Have about 8 of them."
5,I love this style of cheese slicer,I buy the 1 lb block of cheese and slice all our sandwich cheese with this handy guy. I wish I had bought 2
4,Toots got soul!,"It took me almost 40 years to realize that Toots Hibbert is one of the top names in reggae.This is pretty much the best a single disc can be. Nearly everything of his that could be considered a ""hit"" is here. I'd toss on ""Never Grow Old"" and his cover of John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"", but still. The classic ""Pressure Drop"" is included, as are favorites ""Sweet And Dandy"", ""54-46 Was My Number"" and ""Spiritual Healing"", his answer to Marvin Gaye's last big hit. All in chronological order, and with a nice bio.We can no longer see Peter Tosh or Bob Marley live. See Toots while you still can. I did last night. He's still got it."
3,Not a good choice for someone interested in reggae,"This disc deserves only 3 stars for the following reasons. The sound is deficient, so that it doesn't allows to enjoy the music performed by Toots an the Maytals. It is my first disc of this musician and it isn't even pionner in reggae or ska music, the discs sound very trivial and the music has not good beats. If you are finding something different, definitely, this is not the choice."
2,corded caller ID,The plug in for the caller ID is not long enough and the answer machine is difficult to use; it only plays back a message once. The speakerphone works fine and i do like to large numbers.
3,Too much going on,"I like the idea of this very much, however in practice something is missing. You must always have the light on to play, because the 'Handypac' is to high to let light in. Although the joy stick is, i think, a wonderful idea it too has something lacking. I almost find it easyer to just use the arrow keys. In short, maybe it would be best to wait to see if they come out with anything more advanced."
2,InterAct HandyPak Color: a bulky contraption,"if u really have trouble seeing a gameboy screen and would like better and louder sound, this is a great product to buy. unfortunatly, the bulkiness of this product tottaly defeats the purpose of the gbc being compact. personally, i dont like magnifying the gbc screen because all u see r larger pixels."
4,Pretty Good:Please read,"Well,it does have a magnifier,a light,a joystick,and super loud audio ports,and an AC adapter thingy,but the problems are:The light stinks, The joystick & buttons only work if it's in the right position. Over all, I wanted to give it a 5|1/2."
1,not that great,This handypak isn't the best thing because i boght one and it brock tying to get it on my game boy color and the joystick never work and the battiers died quik.
4,A mixed bag but mostly excellent!,"This cd is for everyone who loved the folk music of the 60s and 70s. Though I'm not a fan of a few of the cuts (the first few by the Weavers and Cisco Houston are the weakest on the cd - every one after that gets better and better), others are just as moving now as they were years ago - Joan Baez ""There But for Fortune"" and ""The Times They are a Changin'"" Ian and Sylvia ""The Circle Game"", Judy Collins ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and especially ""Get Together"". Sound quality is excellent. But what's missing is Peter, Paul and Mary -- they have a few great freedom songs that are much more freedom-oriented than songs on this cd than the Kingston Trio's All My Sorrows or the two religious songs included."
1,Wish there were more reviews before my purchase!!!,This is a terrible product! When I ordered there was only one good review and one bad. It is NOT as pictured and I am returning it. This is a pad that says bunco at the top. There are not lines to keep track of wins and losses and buncos.
1,What a joke!!,I should have listened to the last reviewer!! I can't believe I paid over $10 for these pads!! They look NOTHING like they are pictured and are tiny (much smaller than the dimensions described)......disappointed that this product made the cut for Amazon!
1,Not as pictured,These came blankThey had the word bunko on the pads but that was itI paid 10$ for this?????
1,Not as pictured.,"Ordered Bunco Score Pads, received Bunco Tally Sheets. Nothing like what was pictured and what I wanted to receive. Need Bunco Score Pads, but afraid to re-order because I would probably just get more tally sheets."
5,Another fantastic fantasy from a wonderfully talented lady!,"If you read Ms. Welch's reviews(all consistantly good), you will see that they come from abroad. This is because her books are not widely available in the USA. But if you try any one of them, I'll bet that, like me, you will ""run, not walk"" to buy the rest! This is epic fantasy at its finest: great plot, great characters and resolution that remains at issue until the last pages. The good news is that this book has 2 prequels and 2 sequels, the latter available from Amazon.comUK. Ms. Welch is a consistantly fine story teller. Brava!"
1,Not happy,"I was not happy with this version of Jeopardy. I had had an older version and liked it better. The same catagories and questions keep coming up in the newwer version. The older one I seldom had repeats, the catagories had a much bigger selection of questions."
3,Needs More Work,"I think they jumped the gun on this one. They should have taken more time to work out the kinks. My CD is jumpy and tends to skip. There is also too much time wasted getting to the actual game, and no way to go around it that I can see. Also, sometimes the answer misses the mark. For example, the ""answer"" was ""...this family..."" and my ""question"" was ""Who was the Mayo Family"", which was not accepted, but the other contestant's ""Who was Mayo"" was accepted! On the good side, the graphics are wonderful. I think I will return to the old game for now."
4,Jeopardy Junkie,"We love the Jeopardy game. The music and sounds are pretty real, the questions are challenging (there are several levels to pick from), and one, two or three people can play. The down side is that the game is extremely picky about correct spelling of the question, even if you've selected the lenient choice. But overall, we love the game."
2,This game is too hard for anyone,This game is almost impossible to win. I've played over 16 games and it's too hard. The game needs some more work and it gets really boring after a while because the questions are really difficult and they give you so much time for every question.
3,Good for 1 player - no good for multiple players,"I love this game, except for one glaring problem: when multiple humans are playing, one is assigned the space bar as a ring in key. This key always reacts slower than the other keys (control and alt), making mult-player games frustrating."
3,Good product ... but some definite flaws,"I like the Jeopardy CD-Rom game and find it vastly improved over a very old floppy disk version I've played. However, I find it extremely annoying that entire categories repeat themselves frequently, making it impossible to play fairly with other people when you already have seen the answers. Also, on my computer, the player with the control key seems to have a big advantage over the player with the space bar, and overall I have found the questions to be way too easy. I also find that the computer players frequently make ridiculous wagers when they hit the daily doubles. It is not unusual for them to wager all their money when they already have a big lead and take themselves completely out of the game if they miss; nobody in real life would be that stupid. On the positive side, this game closely resembles the TV version, the graphics are crisp and it's easy to play. Just don't expect it to do anything towards preparing you to go on TV and play for real."
3,"The same Jeopardy you've seen on TV, except for a few flaws","All in all, a fun game set up just about exactly as the tv show goes. But I ran into a couple of problems. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the ""alt"" key is considerably slower than the space bar when ringing in and playing against an opponent. This gives an obvious disadvantage to the player stuck with that control. Another is in the variety of questions. For some reason, I know many more answers when I watch the show on tv, versus playing the cd rom (which could be my fault, I'll admit!)but I believe that the questions here are more difficult. Also, I have had ""repeat"" questions come up from previous games, though I've probably played the game no more than a dozen times."
2,too small not a good deal,With the shipping I paid over 4 dollars and it was not worth it. Very small and only a few pictures
5,Great for kids,"Give this as a gift along with some sparkly coloring pencils, and you'll have a winner! The pictures are on vellum so they are perfect for hanging on a window once the creation is finished."
3,Unexpectedly small,"The images are exactly what was expected and were pretty, but the book itself is tiny. I guess I could have read the description more closely, but I was surprised when the palm-sized book arrived. Just know that in advance."
3,"Overpriced, Repetitious Pictures","The pictures are appropriate for young artists, but there isn't much variety. Also, not much value for the price."
3,A Marxist view?,"This is the first book I have read on this subject, so I am unable to really critize this book. Macmullen seems to take a marxist/hegelian view of historical conflicts, arguing that the fall of the empire is due to economic reason, namely privatization, liberalism and the ensuing conflict between the ""Haves"" (the rich, or potentiores or possessores or potentes in latin) and the ""have-nots"", the poor. He concludes by saying that we should learn from history and the fate of private enterprise. I do not know if Macmullen is a marxist, but I was surprized that he ignored the theory I was familiar with, that the decline of Rome came for the breakdown of moral values such as family values and sexual morals. I had also heard about the theories concerning the role of military chaos.Contents:1. Choosing a Theme2. Power Effective3. Power for Sale4. The Price of Privatizing Government."
5,"""The Next Day"" di Leni Stern è un CD meraviglioso!","Scrivo in Italiano in quanto è la mia lingua nativa. Questo CD è semplicemente meraviglioso, elevata qualità audio di registrazione ed eccezionale in ascolto. Diventato subito uno dei miei CD preferiti. Consiglio l'acquisto a chi ama ascoltare la musica da impianti HiFi. Il Cd è solo strumentale (no voci)."
4,The man knows what he is doing.,Typical great Babyface song! It is not in his top 10 but I would definitely put in his top 20.
2,sub-standard wipes,"I used the samples from my eye doctor and had no problem. Those wipes were a different material, pre-soaked with the Occusoft fluid. However, the kit I received had a different, coarser wipe. After a few days use, twice a day, my eyelids were reddened and raw. I had to stop using the product. I never opened the sent product as I had found the kit at my drugstore, at a lower cost, I might add, just after your product was on it's way. There was no way to stop your shipment, so I am stuck for close to $35.00 for both purchases (one from my local drugstore and one from you). Live and learn. Until the manufacturers improve the softness of their wipes, I think I will not be the only disappointed consumer."
1,"Oops, My mistake","The hat arrived on time, but was not what I was looking for.It's some kind of cardboardlike material, and will probablynever be put to use."
3,Good product; reliable service.,"What you see is what you get -- nothing fancy, but better than a paper party hat equivalent. Used as a part of a Chaplin themed-event, and it looked great."
2,Perfect hat...,for my five year old. This hat is by no means a large. Just got it and it is too small.
1,"Not a hat, a toy",Love the shape and look but quality was 5-and-dime with zero wearability...unless you are looking to dress a scarecrow or a mannequin. Ridiculous to include this as a serious offering for a respectable Derby hat
2,Hat is a CHILD size,"Unfortunately, the description didn't say that these hats were a child size large. I purchased 16 of them for a corporate event and they were all too small :("
4,Alright for costume and display purposes,"This is a good bowler hat for the $7 I paid for it. It was smushed into the box it came in and the brim is still a little bent, but not noticeably. It fits fine, the material is what you would expect of a costume hat, however I've never owned a ""real"" bowler hat so I don't know how this material stacks up against one of those. It is actually quite resilient to being crushed and dented which is nice. I should know, I sat on the thing. Not on purpose mind you, but while I was momentarily terrified I was able to pop it back up and the dent disappeared. So you know - it's alright."
3,Nice but too small,I knew this hat was too small the moment I saw the box it arrived in. I couldn't fit it on my head. I'm a young adult female but the hat fits a child. Luckily a young relative of mine loved the hat and it fit her. Not bad for the amount I paid but be wary of the size. I wouldn't recommend it for an adult sized head.
1,not large,"i have a regular dude sized head. i wear a large motorcycle helmet, i wear a large baseball cap, i wear a large headband. not extra large. this thing barely covers more space than a yarmulke. i understand it was a dollar fifty or something, but seriously, buy a much bigger one than you think you need. k? great."
4,Nice little novelty,"I'll start off by saying that this doesn't fit, but I didn't expect it to, I've got a pretty big head. I wanted it for random drawing of names at a party, and it's a nice size and weight for that. Feels sturdy enough, I kinda wish they had an XL-size."
3,large too small,The hat overall was nice for the price. The large size really ran small so it didn't fit and didn't have time to return it. My husband wore it to a costume event but it sat on top of his head - and no he doesn't have a big head. Would have rated higher if sizing was more accurate.
2,Not if you want an smooth finish!,"I bought several packs of these for painting an entire apartment, and they are pretty bad. I don't know how everybody else thought they were great - maybe compared to cheaper roller covers. We have smooth walls, and used top, top quality paint. We did get one coat coverage, but that was because of the paint itself, rather than the roller covers. The covers would start out smooth and beautiful, but within minutes would mat and clump terribly, leaving a less-than-smooth paint finish. They did not shed at all, however, so if your walls are semi-smooth, these covers will probably do just fine. We ended up going to the store and buying some single, more expensive covers that we perfect start to finish."
3,Excellent first use,Good coverage and value. Not for re use. Better to seal wrap with existing paint if need for next day use.
3,It's just O.K. No Saigon Kick!,"This is Jason Bieler's techno-pop-punk CD. I only like four tracks off of this CD. I am a HUGE Saigon Kick fan. So big in fact, that I'd rate them as one of my top three bands of all time! If you're new to Jason Bieler or Saigon Kick, you're better off listening to the four Saigon Kick CD's: 1) Saigon Kick 2) The Lizard 3) Water 4) Devil in the Details. If you want to hear some of Jason's better music (besides Saigon Kick) you should listen to his two solo CD's that he produced. (they weren't available in stores and are now out of print) or even the ""Moments from the Fringe"" CD. What Jason should have done is remade some of his solo songs such as: Control, Arrianne, How Long, Fire Dance and included them on this CD. Otherwise this CD is kinda' silly and immature sounding........."
5,Just Listen to this album-you will love it,"What can I say...It is a great album. You have to hear it to believe it. For those who are long time Saigon Kick fans, it is similar to their sound, but still different. Jason does it again! I can't wait until they release another album!"
2,Beiler trys to get some money in his pocket...,"If you are a big Saigon Kick fan like myself and you haven't heard this, trust me..your better off that way. I bought this album once i read the other reviews on here by other Saigon Kick fans. This is pop-punk! The only song remotely reminiscent of Saigon Kick is the title track(the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of one), there is no variety in this, just power chords and catchy lyrics that sound like they are trying to make money off something that bands like Green Day and Blink 182 have already done. Stick to the first 4 Saigon albums, save your money for something else(even their 5th album Bastards is better than this)."
1,Fuel cells no longer available,"I have a Bammer, which I love, but Porter Cable discontinued the tool some years ago, and as of 2008 the fuel are no longer available, anywhere, period. I've got two fuel cells left, after which my Bammer will be a doorstop. Too bad. It's creepy that Bammers are still being sold. Don't buy one, unless you can get fuel cells--in which case, let me know."
1,can you use a portable air Compressor????,Can you use a portable air compressor for this nail gun??? please please please let me know asap thanks!hello hi ello lol i dont know what else i can type hehe
4,Very Good Summer Beach Read,"I took this book with me on a cruise for a relaxing read. It kept me interested, curious, but not too emotionally attached like serious dramatic books do. It's perfect when you just want to sit on a beach chair and read.Also, I can definitely say that it sure did bring me back to memories of being single quite frequently through-out the book. As a single female, i could relate a lot to the emotions and feelings of loneliness the main character went through. On that same token, it made me appreciate how much I love my boyfriend!"
1,Overall uninteresting,"How can you turn the act of waiting by the phone for a guy to call into a novel? Rebecca Ageiwich has found a way. After our protagonist is suddenly dumped by her boyfriend of two years, she starts a blog as a venue to vent her heartbreak over this and untimately her obsession with finding a suitable replacment. What ensues is 200+ pages of self-pitying and self-absorbed neurosis over finding a man to snag and then marry. We're taken on a journey of dates, both good and bad, and their aftermath, all to the tune of her loudly ticking biological clock. I kept asking myself why I should care. This is clearly a book for the junior-high set. Rebecca, you embarrass my gender."
4,A Page-Turner,"Anyone who has ever found themselves reading a blog and suddenly losing HOURS of their day, will find the same pleasure and delight when they pick up Agiewich's debut novel (memoir?) BREAKUP BABE. What began as a blog, Agiewich painfully details the emotional rollercoaster one woman takes as she is broken up with by her boyfriend (lied to, cheated on, etc) and forced to face the single world again. This was a very enjoyable novel and a great beach read!"
1,Just Fluff,"I read this in the space of an evening hoping to gain some insight and perhaps a bit of wit on dating in this day and age. Instead, what I got was a lot of whiny, self-indulgent boo-hooing about how hard it is to find a good man to date. It wasn't even funny. Nothing of interest here."
4,Great Disc,"Excellent CD. Bought it for the Springsteen cover of ""If I Should Fall Behind"", but the rest of the tracks are very good."
5,One of my best-loved CD's,"I've been listening to Robin and Linda Williams since about 1973, so one might say I've heard a lot of their music, and this collection is excellent. I listen to it over and over in the car. It's great for listening or singing along. The tunes really pull a person in...of course, many of their tunes DO...I recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys country, bluegrass, or old-time music. It's so well done."
1,Buyer Beware of Bait and Switch,"Amazon advertised PHOTO-PAINT 9 but vendor sells PHOTO-PAINT 8. I did not know I was buying froman ""eBay grade"" seller with no connection to Amazon. Lesson, only buy from Amazon and never buy from sellersusing the good name of Amazon."
1,Look elegant but NOT,"The picture on Amazon makes these earrings look elegant and relatively subtle, but they are neither. They look like something a rapper might wear. I wish I hadn't bought them."
4,Angelic...,"While not as contagious as Looking At You or Catch, No Angel is classic Suncreem. There is a recurring bit of haunted harmony by Lucia and several rhythm changes through the course of the track. The mixes are more in a progressive trance style and mix well."
2,You get what you pay for,What more can I say. Its poor quality glass - writing off as bad investment!!
2,macro/fisheye,The lens itself I can't really say much about because it doesn't actually fit my Olympus E-volt 410. It shipped and was received very quickly from Red Hot Buys and I would definitly do business with them in the future...it isn't their fault that the product doesn't fit! ;)
1,sold the wrong item,"Like another reviewer, I saw a picture of the grey top formula, and was sent the black top formula, which is the brand new one. That is false advertising, and misrepresentation. I am very upset, as I hate the black top formula. I disputed the charge with the bank, as the seller did not return my phone call."
5,Conditioner,Have used this product many years and it is excellent for my hair. It is very gentle and removes any tangles in my hair. Love it.
3,Its just okay.,"This is not the ""normal"" humectress I purchase. This is more like a rinse out conditioner, not a thick conditioning treatment. Not sure when it changed."
1,Deceptive - Did not receive same product pictured,Not happy. Did not receive original product pictured with grey cap. Received product with black cap. Not same product. Different and cheaper quality ingredients. Be aware!
5,Princess Maritza is 1 of the mmost touching books I have ever read,"Hi, I am Rachel, I just finished this touching book, it is beautiful. I am so lucky to have read this book. ( I was 3 when this was published!)"
1,I dont think any one person could actually use this info.,this book is sad to read because it makes me realize how much people dont understand the true feeling of being the outcast in highschool. Now i truly feel i cannnot relate to anyone!!!!(just by reading this book)
4,Fits my Goodman furnace,This filters is a good replacement for the original equipment that was installed when we got a new Goodman furnace 2 years ago.
4,Very good piece of reading,"Excellent material, specialy if you are a gynaecologist and have all your patients complaining about their husbands. It gives you an insight of what a male can be going throu. Why 4 stars? Would be nice from Jed to have more practical approaches to some practical solutions. Nevertheless you should read it."
1,Downplays effective treatment for distressing symptoms,"Like other reviewers, I believe Diamond downplays the effective treatments, analogous to women's HRT therapy, now available for the 'andropause'. Interested readers should instead get the book 'Maximising Manhood', by the British endocrinologist Malcolm Carruthers, which addresses the issue of the male menopause and treatment, and discusses the risks (low) and benefits (wonderful).By the way, if you had mumps as an adolescent and a vasectomy later, there is a good chance of exacerbated symptoms of the andropause. I was depressed to the point of suicidal obsession and treatment restored my libido and outlook on life."
5,This book's time has finally arrived,"When the author published this book in the nineties, the oldest among the leading-edge baby boomers were still in their early fifties. Today, millions more are confronting and crossing the 55 marker, and this book has much greater relevance to an aging and influential cohort. Men in my network have been realizing the significance of andropause in personal and profound ways, and most are now searching for answers to the complex male questions about midlife. This book answers questions that barely surfaced ten years ago and provides men with knowledge and encouragement. The author's sensitivity to this passage is profound, and he gives readers many reasons for optimism, as well as strategies to manage a significant life stage. To those who criticized this book as mere pop psychology, I say wait a few more years and then you'll get it."
2,"Interesting concept, but never really proves his case","This book makes an interesting case for the existence of male menopause, but the research is not convincingly, or least not coherently presented. A little too much self-promotion for Mr. Diamond's consulting services."
2,Science without Creation?,"While Americans seek to find all the answers to behaviors through scientific methods, we cannot ignore the master designer of all humans. Absolving anyone--women OR men--of their behavior simply because their hormone levels fluctuate with age and other factors shows disregard for common civility and decency. There is nothing wrong with attempting to explain the ""whys"" of menopausal symptoms, but what each of us does with that knowledge and how we use it to control our behaviors and be responsible moral human beings is the critical issue."
3,OK but not as good as the Illuminator,"The most interesting part of the book (which I really WANTED to love) was the politics of artistry among the artists, their staff, the church and the nobles. The love story is less interesting. Raphael, never before in love, falls for Margherita, a baker's daughter on sight - drawn by her spirit and independence. Onoce they become involved though, the most she does is hang out in places/with things he buys her, making love to him and swooning ""Amore Mio, Rafaello"" and becomes much less interesting, so you wonder what the heck is this love story of the century really all about?Read the Illuminator instead - much more interesting from start to finish"
3,"Move over, Nora Roberts","Just to throw my hat in the ring (bad pun intended :) ) The Ruby Ring is more romance novel than true historical fiction. If you aren't familiar with Raphael's artistic and personal history, it's a light and useful way to learn more, but it would have been nice to read about some other aspects of his relationship with Margherita beyond the bedroom - and the studio - and the kitchen - and - oh never mind. But one would think once in a while they might have done something else together."
5,great book!,"like all other diane haeger books, this book takes you on a beautiful visual journey into the past. i loved every minute of it.the ruby ring is a great book!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I read a lot, and this is one of the worst books I've read recently and certainly the worst ""historical novel"" ever. It is neither historical nor deserving of the title novel. It is comparable to a romance novel, however, the reader never gets invested in the characters and the sexual tension is non-existent. Don't bother with this one!"
3,The ending is worth it,"I love History and purchased the Ruby Ring on the recommendation of museum worker. The story line I found to be very interesting and gave great insight to Rome during the Renaissance. There were more pressures put on painters at this time than I could have imagined. Although the story line seemed to drag at times, reading the very ending of the book made me want more to this story line. I was surprised at the ending, but also at the amount of control the Cardinals and Popes had over painters of this period. An insightful read, and a book I enjoyed."
3,repetitive,"Very little about this book rings true. Which is a shame, because it's a good story, but nearly every scene seems contrived and forced. A few of the scenes that actually deal with art and painting are better than others, but there are too few of those scenes. Once Raphael and Margherita get together, all of their interactions are much the same, with a few variations in words and emphasis. A potentially interesting addition to the painting-turned-novel genre, but not in the same league as some others."
3,dexdrive,this is a great item if you use it as storage ... i cant get anything else on it to work such as the email and i cant get their webpage to show up (i think it doesnt esist anymore). it is the best storage though for your game's memory.
3,Perfect...,Transfer your premade perfect dark combat simulators over the internet to one of your pals.
1,BUYER BEWARE - DON'T BUY FROM NUTRICITY!!!,"If I could put zero stars I would!I purchased two 64-fl oz containers of pure maple syrup from Nutricity through Amazon. The product was fine. Then without ever using it, I decided I wanted to return it for a refund. I printed the return authorization and the shipping label from the Amazon website, paid an extra $15 for shipping, and sent the items back. About two weeks later I got an email from Nutricity stating that their policy is no refunds on grocery items, and if I wanted the product back I would have to pay for shipping back to me. That's fine if that's their policy, but it was not clearly stated, and if that is their policy, I should not have been able to print a return authorization from the Amazon website. I feel like I have been ripped off. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!Save yourself the headache, and just buy this from someone else!"
3,"Product is good, but bottle arrived damaged.","It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak."
3,Commercial Product,"I got this for the MC Diet. Until I found out about private family owned companies that also provide a home made product. That's recommeneded, but if your just getting started you can start with this but FYI it wont be enough!!!"
2,Incomplete description,"What does Non-GE mean?One of the most annoying things about Amazon, whether the product be sold by them or through them, are the incomplete descriptions.The information would be helpful to potential buyers and therefore to the seller. Incomplete descriptions only lead me to ask: what are they hiding, or, are they trying to dump something on the unsuspecting?"
5,"Not to sweet, perfectly hearty.","This is a nice way to go if you need maple syrup in bulk, like in order to do the Master Cleanse, like I did. It will last you nearly a week. It is not too sweet, so you don't get a headache if you put a little too much on your pancakes, either.... wait - Is there such a thing as too much syrup on pancakes? No."
1,Misleading Price,"This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business."
4,Yummy full tasting syrup,Great price for a very good quality syrup. It really has a deep and full maple syrup flavor. Not dull or wishy washy.
4,Moving narrative of a tragic episode.,"To say I enjoyed the book is not quite accurate. It's such a terrible story. But it is well told by the author, movingly told with obvious sympathy for both sides. When I see the book on the shelves at a store or library now, I'm taken back to the event. Very colorful storytelling"
4,Raising Kids for True Greatness,The book is excellent. Anything by Tim Kimmel is full of godly wisdom and very helpful to parents and grandparents!
5,Excellent for parents or non-parents...,"I recently got married to a wonderful woman who has a son from a previous marriage. Since we didn't get the usual 'honeymoon' period that most newlyweds get, I knew I had some learning to do for this new role of 'daddy.' I heard the author speaking about his book on the radio. I checked it out on Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. This book really paid off. Not only does he define greatness in terms of service as opposed to accomplishments for oneself, he gives real-life examples of how to accomplish this. Although he slyly titled the book to be of importance to adults with children, this book should be mandatory reading for anyone who thinks they have greatness defined. Great read!"
2,LAVA IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING,"Yep, that's right...a volcanic eruption in NYC is the premise for this hokey but mildly diverting disaster flick. Seems like nasty doctor Michael Ironside is trying to develop a source of geothermal energy and doing so he starts a volcanic rift under the Big Apple. Dedicated tunnel worker Costas Mandylor is the first to discover the lava flow but of course no one believes him. Enter Alexandra Paul as his geologist ex-wife who is called in to find out what's going on. The FBI is certain it's the work of terrorists, while a high city official is secretly funding Ironside's experiment.The movie is nowhere as intense as the earlier VOLCANO, as it's pending doom never seems large scale enough for a good disaster movie, and the effects aren't that impressive.Diverting entertainment for fans of the genre."
3,"Not Too Bad, But Get Others First","I picked this CD up only because I've loved Jeff since I bought ""You Might Be A Redneck If..."" his greatest album. On this album, he strays from the whole redneck thing (finally) and pokes fun at his wife's family, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and many others. For the most part, its a funny disc but maybe, ""Mid-Sized Funny"" would have been more appropriate"
5,The Scorpion and the Frog,"This book brought me into a world distant to me, however I felt like I was living a life of deciet and fraud. I found the book exciting and Concerning. I highly recommend reading this book before you take your next step forward."
5,the guys who panned this book must work for the mob,"this is a really good book. lauria has a great story to tell, david barry does a great job of telling it. a fascinating but chilling account about what really goes on behind closed wall street doors..."
3,good but not great,"Being a fan of all things Ian Tyson, I didn't think I could go wrong with this release. I love live albums , and thought this would be magic.After a few listens, I decided the let down for me was the slightly loungy ,almost Vegas style arrangements of some classic tracks. Plus , there is something discouraging about picturing the old West as Tyson portrays it, with the very modern electric acoustic guitar sound that roars through the album. I would personally rather here a well miked classic old Martin guitar with a natural tone to suit the mood.Petty complaints , maybe , but I don't get that true cowboy feel from the sound or the arrangements on this album.Really liked Blue Moon though, and even the ""country rap"" . I guess I also have other tracks from his albums I prefer. I didn't think Smugglers Cove would be the track off the Lost Herd album Ian would choose to do.Still, the man is in my top three singer /songwriters of all time."
5,An excellent book of the NY airports,"This book is a great one for all interested in the New York City Airports. I am a FS98 scenery designer and I found this book very useful, so all of the rest should also."
2,more about psychology than about business,Interesting read but she spends ultimately more airtime on psychology than business applications of this technique.
3,It's ok,"Not the version I was looking for, but it is still fun to listen to. The rock versions are hard to find."
3,"Great film footage, but not as imformative as it should have been","Photos were great, dialog was poor. No mention of how they were built, not much was said about the various theories about why it was built, not much said about the people who built it either..."
1,Don't bother,"Thank goodness I looked at the library copy of this. It's turgid and a sure cure for insomnia. You could get a Ph.D for this, as the BS is certainly piled higher and deeper. The show is overanalyzed to shreds. I hope the author has managed to get a life in the time ince this was written."
4,Just what I needed,"This keyboard is perfect. Excellent build quality, works perfectly. I was nervous to order because of the lack of reviews, but I'm glad I did. Yes, the drivers are a little confusing to install, if you're not technically capable, I suggest having someone who is install them for you. Once properly installed, the keyboard works great (in both CS4 and CS5) and I'm very glad I have it."
2,"Good idea, not so good on quality","Pfffff!!! Its a key board. The price is really too much to pay. The shuttle is substandard and the colored buttons are distracting. My mistake, I should have looked before I purchased.The good:Convenient buttons, well labeled for Premierebuttons are smooth, so quality is okLittle light is a neat ideaUSB ports on keyboard are really niceThe Bad:Buttons are distracting if your using this keyboard for anything other applicationsShuttle is terrible. Get a contour shuttle pro if you want a good prosumer shuttleConclusion(lesson) In retrospect, I probably should have purchased a good quality keyboard and aquired a set of Premiere key stickers. This keyboard is way over price, albeit a good idea."
1,Boring - - Wish I had not bought it!,"I love the CD from Next Stop Wonderland and thought this would be similarly fantastic. However, I was wrong -- this is the most boring CD I've heard in a long, long time. I am going to delete the tracks from my iPod."
5,Bossa Nova Lives,"I saw the movie a couple of weeks ago on cable. The story wasn't that great but the soundtrack rocks!! I've always been a fan of Tom Jobim and his bossa nova compositions. The arrangements of Deodato on this CD pay tribute to the master. Anyone who loves the bossa nova genre should pick up this CD. Now, if only I can take some time off to make it to Rio for Mardi Gras..."
5,Worth picking up.,"I heard ""Life if Beautiful"" and wanted to learn more about this group. I am glad I did. The entire album is filled with amazing music. I agree they have a sound that may remind you of Snow Patrol, which is another great group, but they still have their own unique quality."
4,Great CD!,"I just received this album and really love it. These guys remind me a little bit like ""Flock of Seagulls"". The lyrics are fresh and different, any yet somewhat inspiring too. The music is soft and then a simple driving beat.""Life is Beautiful"" is my favorite, but several other cuts are very good. One song sounds similar to the ""Life is beautiful song music wise, but that's okay. I hope these guys keep up the good work and I look forward to future compositions."
2,WEAK,"When I first heard their frontman on a Paul Van Dyk tune I was compelled to look further into this vocalist. Songwriting is weak and melodies areforgettable. (2) stars for effort. Played this once, couldn't even find one tune that stuck out. Haven't played it again since."
2,Rally boots are inferior,"The opening is on the outside of the leg rather than the inside. That shouldn't seem like much of an issue, but I always cross my legs and reach for the zipper in the inside when I open or close the boot. Also, these suckers are hot. I can't wear them in the summer, they're just too warm. The fit is good, but 12 inches is too high. If I were actually going to try and wear these boots on a regular basis I would have them re-soled. I prefer soles with a more knobby grip that will hold on to the hwy pegs better."
3,A good look,"While these boots are well constructed, durable and easy to put on, they are not very comfortable if you are going to walk around very much. They seem to be pretty waterproof which surprised me and they look as good as the day I bought them but I wish they were more comfortable. Still, a good value and I am glad I bought them."
4,its a good dvd,when i got this dvd i knew i was not going to see bands like they was back in the 70s but they put on one hell of a show they recorded in nashvile and ky and black oak is in london england (not ky) and it is the only one from the 70s . but this is a good dvd for the money so if want to see the 70's good luck if not this dvd will do you well
4,Stretch out!,"Great, hypnotic drone-tongue-distension from JB. Mesmerizing for sure, but almost too much so. A few of the same picking patterns recur a little too frequently. I'd love to hear him play more idiosyncratically at some point. Embrace some weirdness, James -- I know it's in you. Still one of the top gtr-float dudes on the current scene."
4,"Quick delivery, good condition","Very pleased with this service. My order was processed promptly, delivery arrived quickly, and the product was in good condition. Impressive."
2,Let down,"After reading all of the rave reviews for this game, I bought it for my daughter's birthday. Once we started playing it, within 10 minutes she hated it. After doing Mario Cart since Christmas, this game just wasn't fun at all. I don't know what I expected, but this is just a mixed bag of games that just aren't fun for little kids or adults. It was only 20 bucks instead of the usual 50, so I'm not out that much. Maybe it will grow on us, but for now we aren't playing it at all."
1,Ridiculously Hard,"This could be a fun game. And I don't agree with the reviewers who find the mini games to be stupid, from what I was able to play of it, a lot of the mini games were a lot of fun (yes, even spinning the cow). That said, I am a fairly hard-core adult gamer and I could not finish this game on story mode. I got stuck in one mini game that I just cannot win even though I've tried about 50 times. As others have said, this is game gets ridiculously hard and then it becomes monotonous and extremely frustrating. I was only able to complete about 6% of the story mode before becoming helplessly stuck and just tossed this thing in the bin."
2,"Great game play, lousy ending","What a fun game to play-assuming you don't mind performing various acts of mayhem and destruction on the unfortunate rabbits! Sadly though, my family and I, particularly my 5yr old, were terrible disapointed at the ending, which compeletely lacked any attempt at resolving the game and giving any closure to the story as presented in the game. That said, as long as you don't get too wrapped up in why you're playing the game, the individual mini games are a blast and have great repeatability."
3,This game was alright...,"We played it, actually I played it, for at the most a couple hours the night we got it. It was fun, fast paced, but repeatative."
3,"Not a bad game, nothing special","I got this game real cheap and it was worth the price. I have heard that part 2 is better. My wife like it a lot when we first got it, but it hasn't been played since."
3,enjoy it,"Rayman Raving Rabbids, for wii games, a little difficult for my kids, but they likes to play it"
4,Different but FUN,I bought this because it was only $20 and all the good reviews. We have had the game for little over a week and it has been a big hit with the whole family. Our boys are 4 and 6 and they love this game. There are a good variety of mini games that they can play with no problem. My oldest especially likes the plunger shooting and cow toss. I like how it shows the motions you need use for the controllers as well giving very good written explanations. It does have some rather immature and in some cases gross humor that my wife feels is a little inappropriate for the younger kids but nothing worse that what you find in Saturday morning cartoons. Some of the games really give your arms a workout and there are only a few of the 70 mini games that we don't care for. I would say this is one of the better Wii games and can't wait to try the other two Rayman games.
5,"I'm ""Raving""!","For all of you who have read ""It's just a bunch of boring mini games"". It's true. It's a bunch of mini games, that are FREAKIN' AWSOME! You play games where they (the bunnies) dance. And who doesn't want to shoot plungers at stuff!? Some of the games are quite hard and difficult...but isn't that why it's fun? you can customize the Raymen with extra clothes and accessories. All in All, this is a terrific game and I highly recommend it!Hope this, really bad review, helps. :P"
4,A great first Wii game!,"I don't do many reviews but I felt the need on this one. Got this for my son for Christmas and it is so much fun. Yes, it is a tad simplistic and repeats some of the types of gameplay. But it is so much fun wii aren't bothered at all by it. Also, the variety of movements required in the various mini-games are great for getting to know your new console. Don't get too freaked by the handfull of negative reviews. It's overall a really fun game and worth the money to me."
5,Crazy FUN(NY)!!!,This game should have you laughing out loud at least most of the time. This game is the best version of bringing a cartoon to life. Rayman has never been one of my favorite gaming characters. Ever since his start on the Playstation. Although this game has taken it a whole new step. The controls work great and the mini games are pure comedy genius. Sometimes the levels can be a little frustrating. Although if you are willing to give it a few tries you will eventually succeed. This game is a perfect example of what the Wii is capable of. Decent graphics and sound and great gameplay.
4,Rabbids Overrun Christmas Dinner,"After trying Raving Rabbids for 35 minutes at the Nintendo World store in Rockefeller Center on Christmas Eve day, my wife and I had to have a copy. Fortunately the store had a supply of Wii consoles; unfortunately they sold out of Raving Rabbids and extra remotes. Undeterred we found a copy and have been racing, chasing, and bashing Rabbids the last 4 days. Rabbids is a great party game with fairly simple controls and makes great use of the Wii remote and nunchuk. I would highly recommend this game to start off anyone's Wii collection."
5,Rayman Raving Rabbids is Radical,"Of the Wii games that I have played so far, Raving Rabbids is the best. Granted, I have only played 3 other Wii games.Rayman is a lot of fun. The mini games are great. My favorite is probably the Cow Tossing contest. It's fun seeing and hearing how the cow reacts after she gets tossed in the air. Wooo Hooo!The game at the end of each level is also fun and interesting. You have to shoot plungers at the bunnies as they try and attack you. Good Stuff!I would certainly suggest playing this game. Now hang on tight to your remotes so they don't fly thru your dad's new big screen TV."
4,"Good game, just not my ball of wax","It seems like a pretty good game, just not the type of game I like to play, I ended up trading it for Paper Mario. It's a whole bunch of mini-games you have to pass. Some of them are fun, like nailing the rabbids with plungers, and there is something of a dancing game (only you just move your arms). I'm not quiet sure this is a $50 game. Maybe $30."
2,hysterical but a little disappointing,"Santa brought this game for my 7 & 8 year old sons. We had seen the commercials and thought they were hysterical. Rabbits screaming with bulging eyes, who wouldn't love that? The game however, a little boring. a little hard to navigate & really not much to do. We were expecting a Spyro-type game and this not it."
5,Crazy Wii fun for all!,"Raving Rabbids is great, it is a fun game and a mini work out all in one! It is super kooky, but really a BLAST to play for all ages!"
5,"Holy Flying Cows, Batman!",I can't remember ever laughing so hard while playing a video game. This game is insane and extremely entertaining. It's got something for everyone. Some of the games were a huge hit with a group of 4. It's also a blast solo. You really couldn't be disappointed by this title.
2,Too Crazy,"I bought this as a gift for my teenage brother. Although he liked it, I still think it is way too crazy."
3,Can get a little repetitive,"This is the first game I bought for my wii console. I bought it after reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews. This game is a series of mini games (lots of mini games), story mode dosnt have any story, just alows you to unlock the mini games. Some of the mini games are tough, and most are fun the first or second time you play them, but as other review state the games do get repetitive. Im 40% of the way through the game and already the game has lost all its excitement. At this point you know what the next challange is likely to be.The graphics and sound effects are great.I think that the way to get the most out of the game is to play in multi player mode, although you still need to unlock the mini games in story mode and all the games seem to require a numchuck,"
2,Hard to Love,"I got this to play with my grandson who lost interest within 15 minutes. It was slow and boring. Maybe we needed to play it longer, but could not hold our attention for that long. I wish I had saved my money."
3,"Funny game, but hard for littler kids","I agree with the other reviewers about the ""fun"" factor of this game, and it is funny to watch the graphics. I just have a word of caution if you have younger kids and are thinking of getting this. My kids are 4, 6 and 8, and on most of the mini-games, they had to hand the controller to me to complete the tasks and move on to the next ""day"". They were able to do some of what the games required, but not long enough/fast enough so they could complete the level, and they got pretty frustrated. Other than that, the game is pretty clever and unique in the ways they have found to use the Wii remote and nunchuk in typical Wii fashion."
5,The Best Wii Game So Far!,"I love this game!! I will start by saying that I am not a huge video gamer, I never had a game system growing up and the only games I ever really played were Mario Brothers and Tetris at friend's houses. But Rayman is a must own for people that have a short attention span, or don't want to get into a game that takes an entire month of their life to get through or you need to spend hours looking up play hints online.There are lots of mini games and so much variety that you can never get bored. You can play in Score Mode, each mini game at a time, or you can play in Story Mode, where you have to beat each mini game to move on to the next level and unlock more games.From games like flinging a cow or pig wrangling, to slapping bunnies that are singing out of tune and pulling worms out of a bunny's rotting teeth it is the most fun you will have with your Wii! You MUST own this game!"
4,Good Fun for Kids of Old Ages,"Bought this as a party game for my wife and friends (30+ Crowd). Although the game doesn't have as many multi player options as I might like, it is still a load of fun with a group. We have found it to be a decent exercise game as well (try the bomb run game). Humor is a great addition; we find ourselves laughing quite a bit at the bunnies and at each other.You do have to beat the single player to get multiplayer access, but we have found the single player works fine with groups as well. Just pass the controller around.Especially now that this is usually value priced (Don't make me a lier amazon) it is a must have you non-stiffys that can have a good time without their 42nd level PattyWarrior and his +2 Chain Sword."
4,Rayman Review,"Rayman is a great game to play to unwind and not focus on anything serious. It is a very silly and completly hilarious game where you perform dance moves and shoot ""rabbids"" with plungers. Seriously, how much more zany fun could you have?"
5,Get out your video camera...,"This game was the biggest suprise I bought. The reviews said it was good, but it looked a bit silly. Anyhow, I bought it along with Zelda and Red Steel. This game is an absolute blast to play...especially with someone else. It has occupied more of my time (and my girlfriends) than all the others combined. You will laugh and you will be challenged and you will be wow'ed by the effort that went into this game. The art direction and creative team that came up with these games and designs needs to be recognized. It's sooo much fun and well yes...you will probably either want to film someone playing it or someone will film you because the game demands acting like a maniac with the Wiimote...and this is a welcome demand. Enjoy."
2,"if you were stuck, you were stuck","this game has a lot of fun mini games. the problem is you have to follow the 'story mode' and win a set of those games in order to unlock other games. So if you got stuck at one, you were stuck forever. I am not a gamer, and my 4-yr old does't have good control either. I helped him on a few games so he can have more game choices, but I really have problem, and no patient, repeatly trying to win one of the mini-game (the pig racing on beach). So after a week, both of us stop playing this game.I would have give it 4 star if they didn't put in such restrictions."
3,Raving Rabbids!,"We purchased our Wii a few weeks before Christmas and wanted to get a game that truly utilized the Wii's unique playing experience. Checked out online reviews and picked up Rayman Raving Rabbids. This game lets you use the Wii-mote and the Nunchuck in all sorts of ways! The story mode does not have much of a story but it is the only way to unlock the mini games. In short play games, smack rabbits, dance, get plungers climb out window! You will need to play ALL the games in story mode to unlock them for the score mode. The score mode is where you can play any of the games with your fellow Wii enthusiasts. The rabbits cracked me and my friends up. This is a fun game to play with a group.I gave it 3 stars overall because of the loading screen and some of the instructions are a bit vague and inaccurate. Overall I would recommend this game. It bring out the best of the Wii."
1,repetitive!,"this game is very fun at first. it is like a funny cartoon. but the mini-games start to get EXTREMELY repetitive and old. at first the mini-games seem exciting and fun. but as you so through the game they start to repeat the same mini-games over and over. a lot of the games are hard, frustrating, and/or annoying and if you dont like a game you have to play it over and over to beat it and move on to the next one. i beat this game in 2 very long tiring days. no mini-game is so fun that i would want to play it again. i havent played the game since i beat it and dont plan too."
2,Bugs you should know about,"I like this game a lot but there are some bugs that you should know about. First, the game does not run in 480p even when the Wii is set to 480p and you use the Nintendo Wii Component Cable. Second, the game does not run in widescreen even when you have the Wii configured to use widescreen. I'm using a 40"" Sony Bravia LCD and the game is stretched and blurry. The manual incorrectly states there is a Video Menu option but this is not the case and according to the UBI website this reference should have been taken out of the manual before it was printed. The UBI website also incorrectly states that the 480p and Widescreen options are taken from the Wii configuration. This simple isn't true. Can you say, bug?!?Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game. It's just the pictures you see on the web for the game are misleading. It's not widescreen, it's not 480p, and the graphics are not that great."
4,better the most mini games,"I really like this one - the mini games all flow together in a nice story. the games themselve are easy, hard, challenging - overall nice mix. Overall fun attempt at humor through out. It's hard to get frustrated at some of the games that are hard when they are just so fun!Glad I bought this one - great for $20!"
5,Never thought plungers and rabbits would be this much fun!,"My 4 year old picked out this game, and I love it. Some fo the content is not really for a 4 year old, you can pass over them for other games. You will get a workout and enjoy yourself at the same time. Another nice this on this game is you never reach a dead end and get sick of the game. This game is at the top of our stack."
3,It's fun with a group,"It's fun with a group of people, maybe not as much by yourself. The rabbits might be a little scary for little kids, but some might enjoy it."
5,Great video game for adults and children,The adults love playing this as much as the kids in my house. all the raving rabbids games are fun.
4,"Fantastic, fun!","This game is SO much fun! I let my 4 year old daughter ""help"" some since some games require the remote and the nunchuck and she had a blast. I agree with the previous review who said that this game should come packaged with the Wii. It really does show a lot of really cool things that you can do with the controls. My favorite is the rhythm game. You really cant help but dance along with it!"
3,Not Bad.,It's pretty good not like the Tv one. This was the start of something big. Still enjoy playing some of the games.
2,Give that 50 dollars to a charity....,"Bought it for my boyfriend. It took him 4 hours to beat the game. So we stared at the credits screen, hoping it was one of those games that continue after the credits. No, all you get are bonuses (so far it seems they are just videos/ads). To get the bonuses, though, you have to go back and play the 10 minigames again, and again, to have enough points. Oh, great!Not worth 50 dollars, or whatever you pay for it.Like most other people said, you use basically the same motions on the minigames... and there are only 10 types of minigames."
3,Fun but kinda gross as well,It's a fun and very addictive game but if you hate gross out stuff this game I recommend avoiding.
1,The most boring game on the Nintendo Wii,"I simply cannot explain in words how boring this game is. The first person shooter aspect of this game is all rail based. You cannot choose where to move and it is very annoying.The dancing portions of this game are worthless and pointless. The gestures you make with the wii-remote are tedious.If you are looking for a fun game that is worth your time and money, look somewhere else.Might I also add this game now has made me feel an urge to kill every rabbit I see."
1,wii games,I would be able to give you details of how good the games were if they were compatable with my wii. Unfortunately unknown to be and a good many other people American games only fit American machines. So no I'm not very happy at all.
3,Raving Sense of Confusion,"The mini-games are fun, but the story-line mode seems to be missing any actual story. Because of that and without any thing to connect everything together the mini-games are their own aren't enough to keep myself or the kids interested. If Ubisoft had wrapped everything up inside of a story or some other ""package"" such as a board game (like Mario Party) the game would be more appealing."
2,Very Shallow Minigames,"This has more shock value than anything and is funny at first. The crazy rabbits are funny to see for the first time and are laugh in a group setting. But as an adult, I find the mini games to be very shallow and get old quickly. I played through the game once in single-player just to play through everything and had a few interesting moments on the side. But I think there are far better minigame collections out there if you want some minigames with any depth. For example, how long will it be fun to slam bathroom doors on crazy rabbits that scream when the bathroom stall doors open? Funny for shock value once, but I look for a little more in a game than shock."
3,for ma,this is great if you need to get your mom something for a present. however if you are the one who plans on playing it it's a causal gamers game
1,THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK!,"I bought this game for my mom and nephews to play but when I received the game I immediately saw that it had little scratches on the edge and knew it wasn't going to work. When I put it in the Wii I found out I was right, it doesn't work. So thank you goHastings for a waste of my time and money, I now know not to buy anything from you ever again!"
2,"WOW, finished so fast..........","I can't help to say this game is GREAT!! buy there are some annoying undoable minigames. This game is a great buy,but only if you play 3 minutes a day. In other word it's like warioware. WAAAYYY to short and WAAAYY too annoying.Not a good buy."
2,what's the excitement?,"There is so much hype here about this game - like it's a next reincarnation of Budda, or, at the very least, Halo, Wii style. But in reality, this is the game with zero story line, awkward controls and plenty of layman jokes, if that is your style. I guess, Wii developers watched the success of Wii Sports and decided that slapping together bunch of mini-games is all that gamers would ever want.Maybe if you are 5 year old kid, pimpled teenager who laughs at toilet humor or bored to death housewife, you will enjoy this game. For the rest of us, pass it like a plague."
4,Lots of fun!,"This is my first Wii game and I'm enjoying it immensely! Some of the challenges are a bit too hard for my amateur skills, but so far I've been able to pass at least 3 of the 4 tests to gain entry into the 'boss' on each arena level. I've noticed that the controller motion isn't always intuitive -- for example when you close potty stall doors, you put your hand in front of the bunny on the stall instead of on the door, which may have moved far beyond the bunny by this time. But once you adjust for those quirks, you can be pretty successful. I think the story is clever, the graphics are great, the little touches like climbing up the wall using the prizes you've won in the arena are very funny. You have to be in the mood for some goofy gaming to enjoy this, but I find it very refreshing!"
3,Some parts of it are more fun than others!,"Rayman Raving Rabbids is the first game I ever played on the Wii. It was a good game to start off with because it explained the controls in great detail, so it was really simple to learn. My favorite mini game is the plunger shooting mini game because it is really fun to shoot the rabbits and it is almost impossible to lose. I don't like the dancing mini game because you have to really over exaggerate the movements in it, I don't know why. Overall from my gaming experience this is an average game."
4,Extremely fun mini games,"Overall this is a very fun game. Initially I was disappointed that Wario Ware was not a launch title, but this game gives you everything Wario Ware does and more. There are a variety of fun and challenging mini-games. THe first person shooter games are hilarious. Definitely worth picking up."
3,Kids love it- once they figured it out,"This game takes a bit of patience to start. I couldn't get passed the first set of mini-games. However- our 10 year old decided to try this out again this week. It had not been played since new years. In the span of our second blizzard of the week....she has completed 60% of the game now. Our 5 year old can't really play much of it- but can't stop laughing watching her play. I like how they mix up the tasks- the mini games keep kids attention, and it seems to be a good use of the motion technology. Great game for the price- just prepare for frustration for yourself!"
5,Nephew loved!,I purchased this for my 11 year old nephew's birthday present. He loved it. It has the silly humor that boys his age like. He enjoys the slapstick humor and crazy antics. My daughter who is also 11 did not enjoy it very much; it is not her type of humor she said it was really dumb.You must know the person you are getting this for to know if they will like it. It was a perfect gift for the person I gave it too!
3,It's ok but just ok,We thought this would be a multi-player multigame and bought it for that reason. It does have some multiplayer modes you can unlock but we wanted it for a party game. Overall it's challenging enough and pretty fun but we will be buying Raving Rabbids 2 since we really want full multiplayer mini games.
4,wierd fun game,"this is fun and better for younger crowds but can be fun for anyone, its alot of repition of what you are doing, not overly creative"
2,Lacking one feature,"It slates it as an S-AV, meaning S-video and the RCA AV (yellow, red, white). There was no S-video connector on mine. The product itself is fine, it's just a Gamecube AV connector like comes with any system. As far as that is concerned it's a fine product. Now, as for false advertising... well, yeah... fail..."
1,Crappy Picture,I tried it since it was so cheap and it was a waste of money. It works but puts a big black grid pattern over the screen. Was hoping improve picture for my snes and N64. I bought a monster cable version of this to replace it and have been more then happy.
4,Not Bad,"A lot of people have been complaining about getting a cable that does not have the S video end, and I had the same problem previously. This time, I got it from Hitgaming, and the one from there does indeed have the S video end. Overall, the cable works, and for the money, I can't really complain. My only gripe with it is if you bend the cable at a funny angle, you will see distortion on the screen. Otherwise, everything looks fine."
3,"Works fine, wears out quick","The cords all join together at one point, making it very flimsy and breaks easily. Picture looks great, but over time the cords will fall apart at the junction point and require some jiggling to get it to work. I'd suggest getting any other cord, this one is fairly cheaply made."
5,good but plug is tight,"i bought this because my gamecube video cord is broken and this item works ,but it was a tight fit. But it works! good buy!"
5,New Testament Video Review,"This CD is a very inspiring CD, with a collection of songs that help a person to feel motivated to seek the LORD JESUS CHRIST for counsil. It also calms a person in this troubled world and gives reflection to the rock of our salvation, JESUS CHRIST. If there is a DVD movie from which this soundtrack has been created, I would like to buy the movie."
3,WHOA!!!!,"Shocking!! But truthful. Like an autobiography...but also like a diary. This was one shocking book! No suspense...just surprises.It kept me reading...when I wanted to put it down in horror or in disgust, I couldn't...the shock had such an impact"
3,Nice but large,Bought size EU 42(US 9). But this fits like US10. So next time I'll try to order EU41. However Good quality and nice look :)
5,Birkenstock sandals,Love these birkenstock. They are so comfortable. I wish that all Birkenstock sandals were suede like this one (since I do not like the Birki fabric) Love them!
4,Wonderful!,"This album is great! It is so fun to hear Joey Ramone out of the ""Ramone"" context. What A Wonderful World is a marvelous cover. Mr. Punchy and Maria Bartriomo are early Who-like fun. It's also great to here the singer of the first ""punk rock"" song sing the first""proto-punk rock"" song (1969) note for note. What a blast! And the best is last. Don't Worry Bout Me is one of the best songs by Joey Ramone ever. When I heard a solo album was coming out I was a little skeptical but this is more than anyone could ask for."
5,Joey sounds better than ever..,"This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. I own 30+ Ramones recordings and this is one of the best, if not the best. Buy it and find out, you won't be disappointed."
4,Everybody's screwed up in their own special way!,"This is the only solo album that Joey Ramone recorded before he died. It is a very good album, with the highlight being Joey's pop-punk cover of Louis Armstrong's classic ""What a Wonderful World""."
2,"Sadly, just more product","I really wanted to love this disc. The reviews are good and Joey is a legend. And then, I had the disc. Clocking in at barely 35 minutes and costing almost [item price], this is a rip off. I'm glad Joey's not alive to see this travesty.And as a side note, the songs that are there are good....."
3,One song big problem,'What a wonderful world' is an absolute disgrace. As heard on the Suzuki Vitara advertisement. Completely sucks any life out of the original track (by Louis Armstrong) and turns it into a cheep flimsy usless...it doesn't even touch the magic of the original. He should be ashamed of himself.
3,Defect,"The flag pictured on Amazon is the correct flag design. The one I received is not correct. The stars on the big dipper handle arch inwards instead of outwards as pictured here. Most people probably won't notice, but it is not correct."
4,Good Primer on Hawaiin Cooking with Local Produce,"This book has a bit of history regarding each garden product. Along with this comes a couple of pages of simple, good-tasting recipes for each. A nice reminder of time spent in the islands and a practical primer on cooking Hawiian."
1,Birth of the Federation Needs to BE REBORN,"What a disappointment! I anticipated beaming onto other ships and mind melds...maybe even a holodeck- at the least great animation...but no. The battle scenes are realistic, fast, and clear, but that is where it ends. Colonization is a still graphic,the races also are not animated. The game is long- the research doesn't seem to make any difference in what you can build- it is very slow moving and uninteresting. It seems like a remake on a lesser level of MOO2. I vote for MOO2."
3,"good, but slow, game","Being from the Master of Orion camp, and having not enjoyed MOOII very much, I was expecting great things from this game. It is a good game--better than MOOII.However, the game has some faults. For the ST fan, there are some problems with the races (the Federation is fairly aggressive when playing as another race, for instance), the play is SLOOOOOW (on a 450 PII, 96MB RAM), and the micromanagement of systems takes a long time to get the hang of (but not nearly as bad as Star Wars: Rebellion).All in all, a good addition to the strategy minded--campaigns can last for days. However, there's still no beating MOO as the best space stategy game."
4,good game for trekkers,This game is very good for Star Trek fans. the multiplayer abilities make this game something special. One drawback is the micromanagement and slow speed for larger galaxies. Overall a very good strategy game.
5,High Prices,"This game has been a great way to blow off many afternoons for the past 5 years. Thats the only problem i bought this game when i was in High School, didn't see it for years then it comes back with little to know mark down. Complain about the price.Otherwise it is awesome.Enjoy"
2,"Great visuals, slow pace","I am a huge fan of both Star Trek and sci-fi empire games (like Master of Orion 1 and 2) but I was disappointed by BOF. It feels a lot more like Star Wars: Rebellion than the classic Master games. The ability to choose which race you play is excellent--each race has its look and feel as well as game mechanics. Unfortunately, it gets boring fast. You must micromanage each and every system, ship, tech advance, other races, pretty much everything. Also, once you get a bit ahead, the computer-controlled races have no chance. And if the Borg show up, forget about it.I'll stick with Master of Orion 2"
5,HVAC book,Great product-just as described. Quick shipping. I received it in time to use it for my college class. I am very happy with my purchase.
3,Not good book,"It is a fundamental textbook for year three students who have no idea about microwave engineering. But this book has too many errors. I suggest to buy another book Engineeering Electromagnetics---Demarest, a old book but theory never expire."
2,Book does not include CD,"This book is equal in quality of content to edition 5 except that the version of edition 6 being sold here does not contain the CD normally included with this textbook. The publisher's web site states ""New to this edition (edition 6) is the inclusion of additional realistic, interactive and in-depth examples on CD"". This CD would also contain the software that was included with edition 5. According to the publisher's tech support however, the version of edition 6 being sold by Amazon.com is for use under the guidance of an instructor where apparently the material on the CD would not be needed. If this book is for personal use I recommend a version that includes the CD."
2,nice cover,"You will need one more book to learn. It is very difficult to follow examples, if you are not expert i don't suggest to buy it"
1,Worst textbook I've ever used,"Literally the title.. So many mistakes and a really irritating way of listing the figures. The example that you are working on will have the figures and drawings in the middle of the previous example's text. On almost every single example, the drawing is literally dead smack in the middle of working out another problem that has nothing to do with it. Imagine working half of a problem, then drawing a free body diagram of your next problem, then finishing up the problem you were working on, then do half of the problem for the interrupting FBD then draw the next one, etc.. I wonder which one of the three authors dreamed up that format.."
5,"Terrific, multi-purpose bowl","I have used this bowl for many, many purposes. It works great for salad, I love that you can snap the lid on it if you want to complete you salad and keep it in the refrigerator before serving or to keep leftovers in. I have used it for popcorn and also for other cold salads to take for larger gatherings.Being Pyrex it is so easy to keep clean and I like the design and weight of the bowl."
5,very practical............,"This bowl gets alot of use more than one might think. Mixing large batches of cookies, making any salad even fruit salad, popcorn. I've cut up whole watermelon and store it in this bowl. Absolutely a must when it comes to gatherings. It is endless to what you could use this size for. I bought it mainly to put the watermelon in it but I'm finding that I grab this bowl more frequently than I had anticipated. It is a good quality bowl. Not as heavy as one would think but it does have weight which I considered to be a plus. It is easy to grab and hold as the shape is wide. You can easily carry this bowl anywhere. I love that it comes with a cover. The design on the outside of the bowl are ridges that is very attractive to the eye. I highly recommend this bowl."
4,Great Game,There is an element of this game (and age of empires 2) that must strike some primal chord in me because I've been playing it for ten years and I still enjoy it tremendously. The newer similar games use a different interface and I just never liked them as much
4,Walking to Town 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle,"I bought this puzzle to give as a gift for a friend at Christmas. The price was very reasonable compared to what was out in the real world and the quality was very good. My friend liked this puzzle. Taking into consideration there was no shipping charge, what's not to like? Overall this was a good purchase!"
2,Projector does not work well,"I bought this book (and others that are similiar) for some of my nieces and nephews. I'm sorry I made this purchase. Some of the projectors did not work at all and had to be exchanged. The ones that did work, did not work well. The image projected onto the wall was very difficult to focus. The maximum size that the image could be seen at was only about a 2"" square. The younger children were unable to use the projector at all without help and the older ones quickly lost interest. I was also unimpressed with the quality of the stories. I would recommend buying a Viewmaster projector instead."
3,mini-projector has its problems,"This is a frustrating toy in that it has tremendous appeal and a great concept but it does not work terribly well. A hardback large book contains five condensed stories (Lion King, 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp, Jungle Book and Bambi) and is attached to a special holder for a mini-movie projector and two mini-reels for each story. In the book, colorful illustrations and large-print words are accompanied by margin pictures showing which of 16 projector images complements that portion of the text. This is all done very well; however, the projector is so mini that it needs to be very close to the wall or screen in order to be seen (2-3 inches) and the image is very small. Also, the room needs to be very dark, which makes it difficult to read the story, even with the projector's second light turned on.This was a great idea but does not work too well, unfortunately. Definitely do not pay full price for this!"
4,"""I let somebody get under my skin...""","After randomly picking up this album in a Cambridge record store, I was pleasantly surprised to recognize this band from a cut off their first album, ""Underdog (Save Me)."" The appealing melody that first made me get that song stuck in my head (in a good way) are just as present on this second release. Laid-back acoustics give way to sparse poetry and an still under-packaged subtlety that had me listening over and over. Their sound is consistent, with new attempts at adding some studio beats to refreshingly rock-solid musicianship. ""Self Help"" and ""Little Brother"" may not be the released singles, but the (once again) more subtle lyrics Turin Brakes occasionally hits on begin to tell their own stories in these tracks. Much of the album is keenly atmospheric, while listening to moodier tracks like ""Full of Stars"" just makes you want to sing along--if only to join in the soulfulness this artistic duo brings to their latest work."
2,a step backwards,"Mediocre and pedestrian follow-up to superb first album. Kind of like the ultimate let-down second date after a picture perfect first meeting. I kept waiting for the magic to come back in but was disappointed on all tracks but the ""extra"" one lurking at the back of the CD (which by the way is getting to be a bit of a tiresome practice in and of itself). Admittedly it would always have been hard to follow up their first release, but couldn't they have made more of an effort at it?"
3,Average,i just got done watchin this The VHS just came in my mail today and popped it in ..... to me This movie is missin a lotta links... it is Atmospheric at times but as i reviewed the Reviews below some of the reviews actually said this film was more atmospheric then The english version .... which id have to disagree .... i think Tod Browning's version is more atmospheric then this.... and i think Dwight Frye is more up to the act of Reinsfield then Pablos whatever his name is Lol.... but it is a good movie.... i think The english version is better but this is as well a must watch classic horror film... if u ever have a chance to watch it .... then do so its a rareity so Enjoyps.... another thing is (dracula didnt say I Bid you welcome) at the first THATS NOT COOL DOOD thats my fav line in the english version!!!
2,ENGLISH VERSION BETTER,CARLOS VILLARIAS WAS AS SCARY IN THE MOVIE AS MY MOTHER IN LAW . ACTUALY MY MOTHER IN LAW WOULD LOOK SCARIER . BELA LOOKED THE BETTER PART OF DRACULA ! CARLOS ACTING LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SCARE BUT IT WAS MORE COMICAL . EVEN HIS EXPRESSIONS WERE AMUSING IN THE MOVIE .
2,Not for me,"I remember using my moms felt curlers and they used to burn my fingertips when I would roll them into my hair they were so hot. NOT THESE. They do not get hot enough to do much to my hair. a HUGE disapointment bc I like the idea of having the built in clip so that you dont get that weird bend at the end of the hair where you start to the hair around. also the clips to hold the roller on, have no storage which makes it hard to keep up with them. overall, not recommended."
3,too small for me,The tea set is very cute but TINY! Be sure to look at the dimensions on the description to make sure this is what you are looking for.
4,NOT Unbreakable,"This is a very cute tea set. It is small, but it's just right for a young girls' hands (think how tiny a real tea set is for an adult). However, it is NOT unbreakable, which is why I bought it. We've had it 2-3 weeks when my daughter broke the teapot. Other than that, she's 4 & she loves it."
2,"No surprises, nothing special here at all.","My wife caught part of this movie on TV and wanted to see the whole thing,so I bought it.While the acting is okay and the plot is not really silly and does not havepeople doing anything really stupid, it just seems to go on auto-pilot fromthe very beginning.There was not a single surprising or interesting twist. I have seen episodesof Law and Order with more suspense and surprise than this movie.As I was watching this, I thought of ""The Absolutely Positively True Story ofthe Texas Cheerleader Killing Mom"" (or something like that); anotherstory of psycho suburban mothers that I thought was considerably moreentertaining than this.I'm pretty sure this was a made for TV movie. If you really want to see it,just record it when it is on."
3,A good late night laugh,"Stayed up late, caught movie on late night t.v. and it was kind of bad. Like one of those B movies you watch only if you can't sleep. However, it did give me some laughs, especially the crazy woman. She was nuts! That chick needed some help. As someone had mentioned before, this movie is not one of the best- in fact it's just teetering over mediocre, but if you happen to catch it don't forget the remote."
1,Love they neighbor,"They sent me the wrong movie and then when I contacted them, they said it was the movie I ordered. It was the wrong movie. It was called love they neighbor, but it was not the right actors in it and it was entirely the wrong movie. I did not bother to send it back because I just did not want to go through all that trouble.And you also have to wait a long time to get the movie."
1,Really bad movie!,This is just a bad movie! It's a good to put youalsleep movies this bad should be given away for free.
5,Fast and as promised,I owned this cd for years but was unable to locate my copy. this replacement was just the ticket. Thanks
4,Waterpik Shower Massager Handheld 5Settings White/Gray,The only thing missing is a setting to stop the water.
3,Good resource for a term paper,"I have looked through this 3-in-1 medical reference and found that it contained very little actual information about latex allergy. Overall, this work seemed to have more of a ""cookie-cutter"" approach. It seemed that it would be a good starting point for a student who was writing a research paper and needed an overview of official resources. The methodology for searching scientific abstracts and other references was useful as a starting point. But there would still be alot of work left to be done in order to access the actual information. I found the Pacific Northwest Foundation's ""Latex Allergy Resource Guide"" to contain much more useful information with a lower price tag."
1,Did not understand!!!!,"I really cannot review the movie on account it did not have English sub-titles like it said it would. It says on the DVD box in English sub-titles. It's just in the Japanese language. It made me cranky! Now would you believe this? The previews on the DVD had English sub-titles! Be careful if you purchase this movie, if your expecting English you may not be getting it. I didn't. You've all been made aware of this major glitch."
5,Flintstones In Viva Rock Vegas,One simple question.... What is the name of the tune and who is the artist (guess that is two questions)of the song that plays when Fred takes Whelma home to Betty's after going to the carnival. It continues while Fred and Whelma are dating in fast scene switching. Help!
4,IF you are a BIG fan of Yes' 90125 or Trevor Rabin a must have,"I love 90124 from Trevor Rabin because Yes' 90125 is one of my all time favorite albums. Even with 90125 and 9012Live I want more, and 90124 fits the bill. All of the songs on this CD are in the 90125 era and style, and several are demos of the songs made famous by ""Yes"" (Hold On, Changes, Moving In, Owner of a Loney Heart, Walls, Love Will Fina A Way, Cinema). All 11 tracks on 90124 are great songs and are interesting if you want to hear the evolution from Trevor's demos and solo recordings to the finished product released by Yes."
4,Interesting work,"If you're into demos and pre-production, then you won't want to miss this one. Laying out the foundations for the second of Yes (in the early-to-mid 80's), this CD highlights where much of 90125 came from.Additionally, the added tracks that didn't make it to 90125 (along with demos) are an auditory treat for fans of that album, Yes, or music of that genre.Certainly a great score, very glad I got it. :)"
2,Dissapointing,"Not well recorded or produced.If you were expecting a little more prog leaning to 90215,forget it.Don't waste your money."
5,Leadership tips written for everyone,"What I found unique about No-Nonsense Leadership is how easy Dave's principles are to apply.Forget all the hype and headlining many leadership trainers are promoting. Dave Anderson is right on the money because he has worked in the trenches --he's suffered your worst nightmares! Best of all, he gives you dozens of techniques you can go out and apply right away in your job.If your 2002 book budget is tight, buy this book and read it every single day of the year! Your career will take off..."
3,very small,Product was much smaller than I thought it would be. My niece was still happy to receive it.
2,Batteries are weak,"Drill works fine as does the charger however, the batteries are not 100% by a long shot. I really am disappointed with the product because of the batteries, after all, what good it a cordless without batteries.Considering the cost of a new 12v battery, an upgrade in voltage would be the way to go."
2,OK at the Best,"This book helped me decide to never read ""sequels"" by an author other than the original. I think that Elizabeth and Darcy are best left behind at the end of ""Pride and Prejudice"". The author didn't enhance the characters, only applied typical 21st Century romance-novel techniques.Let the Bennets and the Darcys have their happily ever afters without embellishment....."
3,Enjoyable Sequel to Pride and Predjudice,"I was prepared to be lukewarm, but I have to admit to thoroughly enjoying this book. Yes, there were alot of steamy scenes (but true life if filled with those anyway, so why not include them)? Linda Berdoll's first attempt at writing was well worth the effort of reading it."
2,mis marketed,"I bought Mr Darcy takes a wife and though it a great read, very enjoyable. When looking for more books by Berdoll I am told by Amazon that those who bought Mr Darcy takes a wife also bought Bar Sinister. What an unwelcome surprise to find that it is exactly the same book. I was pretty ticked off.It is discourteous of Amazon to marked these books this way without making it clear upfront that the books are the same, only published under different titles.I have bought a lot from Amazon, but today I am angry with them."
4,"Filthy, intriguing fun","My fave books are PnP and any crappy romance novel - so this was a great combo for me. The author tries to use a lot of big words, which can be distracting; but she tries to use a writing style that seems similar to Ms. Austen's in some ways. One of the more memorable PnP spin-offs...as I've noticed they all start to run together."
1,It really rates less than 1 star,"While reading this book I suffered from an eye injury, which was caused by excessive rolling of my eyes in disbelief and horror (e.g. using a mirror to watch themselves having sex; Elizabeth and her fascination with Darcy's boots, Elizabeth being kidnapped, etc.). At first, I thought the book must be a parody but after some investigation I discovered it was a ""serious"" attempt to further the story of Elizabeth and Darcy. I also am seized with the horrible mental picture and idea that this is the type of book that Mr. Collins would read and find exciting."
1,not if you are a jane austen purist,"if you judge the book on the fact that it is a story using characters with the same names as in Pride and Prejudice it is an okay story with way too much sex (unless you are into romance novels, which i am not).as a Pride and Prejudice sequel, this is awful. i didn't realize what a jane austen purist i am until i read this book.do not read this book if you are a purist."
2,Poor Jane Austen-- rolling over in her grave!,"Poor Jane Austen is probably rolling over in her grave because of this book! Imagine the deep crimson of her blush!The explicit and verbose text is more than necessary, and deviates from Miss Austen's light and witty writing style. Some occurances are amusing, but overall the story line is melodramatic and inplausible.The characters either change very little (Jane is still exceedingly good, Lydia and Mrs. Bennet remain half-wits, Wickham is evil, Lady Catherine is condescending etc.) or they change so much that they are hardly recognizable (Bingley and Georgiana characters are changed most dramatically)."
1,A prodigious letdown!,"This book was given to me as a gift from my sister-both of us avid Austin fans. I will admit that halfway through this nauseating pseudo-sequel I was unable to finish. This was given to me on my sickbed-unfortunately I found this book adding insult to injury. I use the word pseudo universally-completely inept use of period language, an abhorrent imitation of any and all things Austin! The only possible productive use of this so called ""work"" is the recycling bin. I hope Jane never finds out about this!"
3,Warning,"For those that want a story that is true to Jane Austen's style, this is not the book for you. I read this book with the same mindset that i watch movies. The original is always the best. Overall a fun summer read, but go for the classics if you want a great story.P.S. It's the same book as The Bar Sinister. Don't make the mistake of buying them both."
1,Blechhhhhh!!,"OK, how many synonyms can you think of for sex organs? Because that is what the author seems obsessed with. I found this book to be very mundane reading, not in sync with Pride and Prejudice. It's like the characters in Pride and Prejudice have shown up in a lame sex guide. I'm not offended by it, I just found it to be too far from Jane Austen's work to be acceptable."
1,offends the senses and sensibilities,"I'm not a purist but honestly- Lizzie beaten and nearly violated, Darcy a murderer, an adulterous Bingley, Georgiana knocked up- it was all too much. Horrifying! This author seems to hate these characters and invents any number of tragedies to fuel the weak plot. I also hated the euphemisms, tired expressions, asides, and parenthetical comments (if I don't know the main points of P&P, I wouldn't be reading the book anyway.) I guess the only saving point is that this Lizzie and Darcy are purely the author's invention and don't resemble the originals at all."
2,SO NOT ELIZABETH AND DARCY way too much sex,"This book is not a continuation of P&P. It has the same characters but instead of reading like P&P it is like the run of the mill romance novel. From page 3 your realize that the author is so off base with the characters and if you can detach yourself from P&P it is a ""tolerable"" read lol. I am midway through and am going to finish it but I definitely had to look at the characters as being completely different people than the Bennets, Darcy's, Bingley's etc. The amount of sex fills every third page. In one scene Elizabeth mounts Darcy in their carriage. It is like come on now! One would hope they would have a healthy sex life but the explicit details cheapen the characters, their love and this novel. SO you are forwarned it is not the same people as in P&P and if you can get past that point I guess you can give it a read."
1,Hard to swallow,"Hard to swallow.And I'm not alluding to one of her enormous pile of euphemisms for sexual body parts.To be fair, I didn't read the whole thing. But, to borrow one of the author's own weird word choices, I was ""bumfuzzled"" by reading as much as I did. Note that this is NOT a word that came from Regency English vocabulary. It's a rare one from the U.S. South, and somewhat slangy. (It actually means ""confused."")Perhaps this book is intended to be a parody. That's the only way I could accept it as legitimate. The vocabulary over-use and abuse is so prevalent and the soft-porn such a big part of the writing, I'm not sure how else it can be taken."
1,J.A. and P&P Used and Abused Extremely Ill,"I give this book one star not for its sexual content (that doesn't bother me), poor grammar (I'm no scholar myself), or even its story (not that I enjoyed it), but because the author shamelessly uses Jane Austen's beloved Pride and Prejudice and its characters as a marketing tool for her book.The characters and their actions are so unlike the originals that it turned me off and set me against the story altogether.I can only imagine the author was not confident enough in her work that it could ""stand"" on its own without J.A. or P&P; as a ""crutch."""
1,New characters disturbing,"The early part of this novel coasts on the characters created by Jane Austen. The sex scenes are exaggerated and the language is stilted but sometimes clever. I enjoyed it as a parody of Austen's work. But once the author introduces new elements, the characters are crude and poorly drawn while the plot incidents are increasingly vulgar and violent. One of the new characters is a maid at Pemberley who becomes a prostitute and drinks herself to death. Another is a brutal rapist. A third is a French aristocrat who endures sexual indenture before she escapes the guillotine in a repulsively explicit scene. Darcy himself murders three highwaymen in a fit of rage. None of these characters or incidents follow the sensitivity or genius of JA. Unless you enjoy grand guignol fare, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you should leave this book alone."
1,Ugh!,"My bookclub chose this book, so I am slogging through. I'm about half-way through now and trying to decide whether or not to continue. I agree with the previous reviewers who said the word choice is cringe-inducing, the grammar is off, the plot is not suspenseful, and the characters are boring (of course, things will always turn out well for the well-endowed, handsome, rich hero and his beautiful, charming wife -- blech). There was more romantic tension in P&P, which treated the subject delicately, than in this novel, which pounds you over the head with it."
1,"It's supposed to be a parody, right?","That's the only feasible explanation for this dreadful work. It reminds me of nothing so much as one of those improv shows where the audience calls out styles and the performers end up doing a Western in the style of Chekhov or science fiction as a teen drama. In this case, the author attempts to do Jane Austen in the manner of a bodice ripper, and does justice to neither. The problem is that the author isn't comfortable in either style, so everything sounds stilted and unnatural. If she's not overusing words--when was the last time YOU read/heard ""howbeit""?--she's misusing them. I'm not in the least surprised that this was originally self-published, but I am surprised that a reputable publishing house took it on."
1,A Gross Attempt to Re-write a Classic,"Now I know why Cervantes killed off Don Quixote after another man wrote a fake sequel for the 1st part of DQ.Faux Jane Austen porn. Those words should never be written together, but sadly, this is what we have in ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife."" It should be called ""Mr. Darcy Has Lots of Sex."" I don't mind the sex, it's just so ridiculous and over-the-top. Not tasteful at ALL. Jane Austen would turn over in her grave if she knew about this book (and I do not think she was a prude...she just followed the social mores of the time, while quietly subverting what she found distasteful). This book is a pathetic attempt to re-write Regency lit in an awkward late 20th century way. YUCK."
2,Couldn't do it!,"I'm a huge P&P fan and was really excited about reading this book. I read previous reader reviews and was perfectly prepared for the attempted 19th century language and all of the steamy scenes between Elizabeth and Darcy. I was really expecting to enjoy this book, but to put it bluntly - it's boring! There are too many side stories, the book moves VERY slowly and it's just not worth the effort. I'm a big proponent of finishing books even if you're not in love with them, but I had to give this one up. Sorry Linda! I was rooting for your book!"
1,Terrible,"I'm generally a fan of 'sequels' and continuations of Ms Austen's work, but this novel is just simply disgusting. It takes away all that is good and fun of Pride and Prejudice and really, feels nothing at all like the Regency period."
5,A book that would make Jane Austen proud!,"At first, I was a little leery of reading a sequel to one of the best classics by a different author. However, I could NOT put this book down. Linda Berdoll keeps the Austenian language alive, with a few modern twists here and there. I simply adored the sexuality and intimacy she gave Darcy and Elizabeth. If you are looking for the best attempt to continue the story and legacy that is Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, then Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife is the book you want. After you read it, you'll immediately buy the next sequel that continues the story by Linda Berdoll, Darcy and Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley."
1,Horrible,"Not true to the characters, over the top with fake Austen dialog...Read ""A Civil Campaign"" By Lois McMaster Bujold if you want some modern day rollicking romance/politicking..."
5,A really fun read!,"I really enjoyed this book. It is clearly not a sequel Jane Austen would have written herself, but very entertaining regardless."
4,Great read,"I love romance novels and thought this book was a great read! So if you are like me and always wish that the stories go on, here is your chance. Enjoy!"
1,Too bad for words,"This book was just so bad I couldn't finish it.I own over 1000 books ranging from the classics (including P&P;) to downright fluff and chick lit. This book is at the absolute bottom of my list. I've only written one review before, it was for an apallingly poorly written book. This book is even worse."
3,Suprisingly Unsure ...,"I am a great fan of Jane Austen's novels, especially Pride and Prejudice! Therefore, I jumped at the chance to read a sequal which would continue the story that I instantly fell in love with. However, after reading it I had mixed feelings. For starters it was well written, and it kept me interested and wanting to read more; however, many of the characters were not the characters I fell in love with. Plus, the ending and all the things revealed was a bit much. Yet, all in all, I would have to say if you want to read what happens after the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Darcy this is a good place to start."
1,Incoherent and Inaccurate,"The authors knowledge of the movies made of Jane Austens books is vast, but I am highly suspect of her having actually read the books. Read this novel only if you are intrested in seeing the layers of Elizabeth Bennets complex character peeled away only to reveal someone out of a trashy romance novel. The information is inaccurate, starting with Lydia's annual sum of 100 pounds not 50. I read all of Jane Austens novels with ease, the language was not a distraction. This book reads like it was written with an 18th century thesaurus and dictionary at hand trying to cram in as many things as possible in order to appear authentic. At one point there is a narrative sentence that reads, "" Mr. Wickham was in high dudgeon"". It was so random, just out there in the middle of the page, screaming, ""do you remember this from the movie?"" Writing menus as a chef, I feel I am more qualified to write a book."
1,So sorry i paid for this,"But serves me right, listening to random people on the internet rave about a book.So, SPOILER: are you really looking forward to Elizabeth Bennet-Darcy having a miscarriage, then giving birth to a stillborn baby, Mr Darcy commiting triple homicide, Mr Darcy going deaf while fighting the war against Napoleon (!), Georgiana marrying a nearly-blind Col Fitzwilliam (ahem, Napoleon's doing again), Wickham being Mr Darcy's bastard brother, all wrapped in the most repetitious faux-regency language? Cause it's some 600 pages of Civil-War X-rated adventure-romance crap. Say with me: ""howbeit, betwixt, howbeit, betwixt"". If it sounds like your style, go for it.My only consolation is, the characters are so *far* from Austen's, there's no chance any sane person will buy this story as being ""the continuation of P&P;"". Grrrr."
1,Fanfic put into binding,"I read this book from the local library, on the misguided presumption that it would be a fun romp through a familiar world.A bit too familiar, however, and I ended up skimming through to the bitter end. The prose is annoying, about on the level of a teenager trying to mimic Austen. The sex is worse, approaching the silliness of romance novels without the visceral thrill of ripping bodices. Although, I think that a bodice may have literally been ripped somewhere in there.There is one silver lining to this mess: fanfic writers take heart, Landmark Press is the place to send your manuscripts. Sure, Star Trek, Harry Potter and Boston Legal are all copyrighted, but just change some names and suddenly you have a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea sequel that will fit in nicely between the shocking 3(!) sequels Berdoll has churned out."
1,Embarrassing,"I am an avid reader, and this is the second time I ever write a review. I have to say that this time I could not resist it. Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and I admire Jane Austin (and her characters) for their sense of class. ''Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife'' however is a cheap porn book that discredits what Jane Austin did and utterly misrepresents the characters. 60% of the content is about sex (cheap sex) and is about Mr. Darcy and Lizzy coupling please forgive me like rabbits (in bed, in the bathtub, in riding boots, without riding boots, and so on).If you are looking for a cheap porn, it could be OK but I believe there are better ones out there. If you are looking for a classy continuation of a great book, certainly look elsewhere."
3,Deception,"When Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife first came to print, it was not disclosed (as it is now in the editor's description, above) that it was the EXACT SAME book previously released as Bar Sinister. I have read Bar Sinister, and enjoyed it for the long, bawdy, sexy soap opera it was, perhaps only because imagining Colin Firth as Darcy in each scene was immensely stimulating to my...imagination.I have enjoyed many of the sequels for reasons mentioned by other reviewers. Some because the authors have captured such a wonderful Austenesque voice and come close to contributing more of what Jane-ites desire in the repertoire, and some for pure fun.I still give this book 3 1/2 stars because I enjoyed it, and have actually re-read it. My objection is having to buy such a tome twice. I am not amused, and am suspect of future writings by this author(ess?) and publisher."
2,DID SHE READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE?,"This book by Linda Berdoll only shows that an amateur trying to write a sequel to a very famous book, by the wonderfully gifted writer, Jane Austen, should stay ""at home on the range"" and stick to reading her Harlequin Romance paperback novels.After working my way through this book, in one paragraph the Darcy's intimacy to absolutely nothing at all that made any sense to this book, I was so relieved that it only took a very short time out of my life to read it and how happy I was when I finished it.What bunk! Did Linda Berdoll even read ""Pride and Prejudice""? Did she understand the characters that she was writing about? Lastly, does she live in the real world? NO!I have never been a fan of sequels, but please Ms. Berdoll stick to reading trashy romance novels and forget writing your own fantasies!"
1,An insult to Austen,I was sorely disappointed in the base depiction of characters from a classic. Why ruin a good story when there are lots of other cheap novels to write sequels to!
4,Fantabulously smutty,"I'm normally very snotty about books that try to follow in a great writer's footsteps, but sometimes a writer pulls it off with enough verve and elan that I have to applaud. This book would make Jane Austen faint dead away, because its main plot is wild sex, with a side of more sex and a plotline or two about people not having sex. And you know what? It's fantastic fun. It's a quick, entertaining read and I found it genuinely erotic. The P&P miniseries gave us two gorgeous and charismatic leads, and this book simply extrapolates on the Darcy's post-marriage life based on those smouldering glances that were such a great part of that miniseries."
1,Yuck!,"This book is so bad that it is hard to describe. It does no justice to Austen and her characters. In places, I thought I was reading bad Victorian porn. Truly a hideous read."
1,Mr. Darcy takes a wife,"I was quite annoyed with this book. It was a huge departure from the story of Pride and Prejudice. I expexted this story to follow the gentle narrative of the original, instead, it was a bodice-ripping fest. Very disappointing."
2,Love Jane Austen,Book long almost 500 pages the original Pride and Prejudice was not this long. Had to reread some pages because I had trouble understanding what was happening I guess because of the way they spoke then. I also thought there was to much sex. I know Darcy and Elizabeth loved each other but almost every chapter has them having sex different ways. Not sure I want to read the next book.
1,The first rule of good writing...,"...is ""Keep It Simple, Stupid!"" something Jane Austen instinctively understood. There are no overused or unnecessary words in her prose. Her descriptions are always eloquent and elegant, with nothing wasted. Linda Berdoll would have done well to follow her example. I kept thinking of a line from the film ""Amadeus"", ""Too many notes."" This book had too many words. I never plowed through so many useless words in my life. I really suspect some of them don't exist. Though the main bulk of the story wasn't bad, the plot got lost along the way, probably in all the sex scenes. Again, even that was way too much! She could have cut out half the verbiage and still told just as much story. There are many good Austen sequels out there, so do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
3,Pride and Prejudice meets True Grit.,"I enjoyed reading this because I didn't really expect anything more than a trashy romance novel. It was only a little better then that. This was Elizabeth turned into a plucky romance novel heroine. Lots of physical courage but I found myself wishing the author could write her dialog with even a touch of the spark that you could see was attracting Mr.Darcy so much in the original.The part that really put me in the Twilight zone though with this story though was a battle with the French scene out of John Wayne's ""True Grit"" Complete with an entire line taken verbatim out of that movie!! (The part where John Wayne has charged the other guy with his reins in his teeth and is now pinned by his dying horse and can't get up.) I was kind of shocked by that. Tsk. Ripping off dialog from a movie? Kind of made me think if the author is getting that lazy I don't really need to read the next book. I've probably seen every movie she has."
1,There Is Simply No Redeeming Quality in this Book,"You're probably wondering if this book could really be that bad. The answer is yes. It mistakes Austen's lack of description of physical intercourse as meaning that her books lack emotional tension. I would argue that nothing could be farther from the truth. However, even if I were to grant the author her presumption (which she or her editor chose to justify with a quotation from Charlotte Bronte), the preferred remedy would not be to substitute distasteful descriptions not only of the Darcy's wedding night, but of various rapes and other intercourse by other characters.I am not a stranger to romantic fiction. This book had sections that would have seemed coarse if written on a bathroom wall. And as other reviewers have mentioned, it did little to advance the story of Pride & Prejudice since the characters behavied in ways that seemed so contrary to their personalities."
1,Yuck,"Folks, let me admit right off that I didn't make it past the first page, but that was enough. The opening paragraph relates the fact that Elizabeth- our beloved Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennett!- needs to sit upon a cushion, because she is sore from all of the vigorous sex she has been engaging in. Hey, I'm not a prude, but I don't want soft porn populated by characters who are beloved for their very emotional restraint. It's a travesty. Don't give this dreadful author your money."
1,Pemberley Polluted,"""Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"" Apparently, they are. This is by far THE WORST book I have ever read. I might have been able to express interest in the story line had my better sensibilities not been outraged over the treatment of Jane Austen's original characters. In my mind, Linda Berdoll has DEFILED the characters of both Mr. Darcy and Bingley. The sex between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy can only be described as pornographic. It is disgusting rather than romantic. Bingley, who in the original is so enamored of Jane, has an adulterous affair. It doesn't even make sense. Not only has Berdoll butchered Austen's endearing characters, but she has also butchered the English language. I'm not sure whose style she is trying to imitate, but it is certainly not Austen's. I love to re-read and pass on my books, but this book is destined only for my trash can."
1,Jane's rolling in her grave over this book,"I love P & P and was hoping for a continuation. I was also hoping I found it in this book. Wrong! I've owned it for over 2 years and have yet to finish it. In fact, I picked it up the other day and told myself that before I could start another book I had to finish this one (so I can put it on Amazon to sell). I didn't expect erotica disguised as a continuation of a classic novel. I have no problem with erotica. I just didn't need or expect to read about Lizzy & Darcy's intimacy and with such graphic detail. Yeah, he's well endowed and she's got big boobs and learns to go down on him. I wanted a love story, not to learn about what he learned from whores in his days as a single man and in turn teaches her. Shame on you, Linda, for taking a beautiful, classic love story and cheapening it to a dime-store novel. It should come with a yellow highlighter for those willing to read it through to the end. Might just sell it without finishing it."
1,Mr Darcy Takes A Wife,"I thought at first that I would like this book,but there is just to much sex involved.It's taking me way to long to read it."
2,I'm glad Jane Austen is not around to read this,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. As a Jane Austen fan I was highly offended to see the beloved characters of Darcy and Lizzie used in a poorly disguised romance novel. That is what this book truly is, and if it had been billed as such and used different characters it would have been fine. Not wonderful, but not bad to read if that's what you're in the mood for and you don't have anything else around.My sister commented that it would have been more appropriately titled: Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife Over and Over and Over...."
1,PLEASE!!!!,"I lost count of the many references to the male sex organ in this book. This is nothing but a cheesy romance gone bad. True to the characters...I don't think so...Mr. Bingley cheats on Jane and has an illegitimate child...please!!! And Darcy and Elizabeth...author didn't really know their characters at all. If I was writing my first book, I don't think I would attempt a sequel to a classic. I was very disappointed in this book. Waste of time and money. Please don't make a sequel mini-series out of this one...like they did with ""Gone With the Wind."" Spare us.Some things are better left alone. Don't mess with a classic."
4,I HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THIS BOOK BACK FROM FRIENDS,"I really enjoyed this book. It was the first of many sequels to Pride and Predjudice that I have read. I couldn't put it down, I have had many of my friends read it also, leaving them wanting more at the close of the book. It does have some saucy stuff, but who of us out there has not wondered what Mr Darcy said and did to Mrs Darcy on their wedding night. I enjoyed the continuing story of the favourite characters from Pride and Predjudice. I was also suprised by how interesting the additional new characters where and how I was left wanting to learn more of each of them. But the story Linda Berdoll has created of Darcy and Elizabeth in the years following their marriage is filled with all the emotions, high and lows that you would want for them and more. It is a really entertaining book and I highly recommend it."
1,Boiling Mad!,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of a new P & P sequel, especially from this author whose previous endeavor 'Bar Sinister' I enjoyed. I open the book last night to discover that the book isn't just LIKE Bar Sinister, it IS Bar Sinister.The publisher should have warned us, and told amazon about the change of title. In the meantime, I am returning it!"
1,"The Ruining of ""the best english novel ever written""","This piece of trash is no better than some cheap romance novel. I have never been so disgusted in my life. I love all of Jane Austen's works, and was sorely disappointed with this filth. How on earth did someone let a hick from Texas write a sequel to an 18th century masterpiece? It was obvious that the woman didn't even read the novel and only watched the movie. It pained me to read it, and I desire my money back. What a waste of three hours. If any educated person desires a fulfiling, and challenging novel, do not look here for enlightened thinking. The complete lack of elegant and well organized prose is nothing like Jane Austen's educated writings. If one loves the writing of Jane Austen, for its undercurrents of satire and wit, then do not look here to quench your literary thirst."
4,Worthy sequel to P&P,"Although this might sound sacrilegious, I wasn't a big fan of Austen's Pride and Prejude--I thought it needed a little more life to it. But I love Elizabeth as the heroine, and Berdoll does it up right. ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"" is just the juice the story needs to continue. Elizabeth and Darcy are lusty, funny, and smoldering, and the plot is enough to keep up with the 2 of them. A fun, well-written romp through the English countryside. It will be one of the few books I choose to re-read!"
1,"""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"" - The Library term is 'trash'.","As a lover of English literature, I found this book offensive. Ms. Berdoll has managed to write a book which is on the same level as any sleazy, cheap, paper-back 'romance'. Jane Austen must be spinning in her grave!."
2,Big disappointment,Not a big fan of this book. I had to keep making myself continue on just to finish. The language is to convoluted and strained to sound like Jane Austen and it falls flat. The story is is full of sexual encounters that Austen would never have approved of. While this may not present a problem for readers today there is something to be said for leaving somethings to the imagination.
3,Okay but not if you are an Austen fan,"The only real way to enjoy this story is to completely separate it from Pride and Prejudice. All of the characters from the original Austen are taken completely out of character. The story is fine if you don't think about where it is supposedly coming from. If ou want a romantic/erotic read then read this. If what you are looking for is a continuation of Pride and Prejudice then don't take this one. It completely ruins Mr Darcy's integrity, to say nothing of Bingley's. Lizzy loses al of her grit and Jane...well nobody is that stupidly naive!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Wowsers, this book is atrocious. Suffice it to say, the author likely has never read Jane Austen. She probably watched the BBC version of P&P;, fell in love with Darcy, decided to write some fan fiction, and ended up with this book. At least it would explain the author's misplelling of Ms Bennet's name and her confusing the characters and story line.It would also explain why the writing is so bad. No wit, nothing of interest... just modern day sentences that have less-used synonyms swapped out here and there. And a pathetic storyline and dialogue. really. I stopped after the first few chapters.I had read the reviews of this book and I knew not to expect much, especially compared to Austen's original... but oh em gee. This book is garbage even compared to my 15 year old brother's novel about a futuristic world war III with mutants and tons and tons of 15-year-old-boy-esque gore."
1,Poorly Written,"A sad portrayal of the timeless characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. The book was poorly written, and the way the author describes the couple makes the reader feel like they are reading a soap opera instead of a classic piece of literature. I do not recommend this book."
1,A Poor Substitute For Jane,"I read this book the first time and was dismayed and disappointed by it's story line and direction Ms.Berdoll took the characters. I read it a second time with an open mind hoping that I would find it more fulfilling the second time around. I was disappointed. This is a juvenile attempt at an addition to a classic. It didn't follow Ms.Austen's ideas of the characters, and a poor version of what I'm guessing was the authors attempt at erotica with her sex scenes. Either keep true to the characters or let well enough alone and stop with the original. Love Jane Austen, hated this book."
2,Soap Opera and Sex,I was disappointed in the style of this book. The author used soap-opera type plot devices and excessive sexual antics rather than character development to continue the story.
2,Miss Berdoll Takes Artistic License,"In ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"", the ""sequel"" to ""Pride and Prejudice"", the saga continues with all your favorite characters from Jane Austen's original novel. The story begins after the engagement, but before the wedding of Elizabeth Bennett to FitzWilliam Darcy and Jane Bennett to Charles Bingley. While the novel follows the style of the original, be prepared for constant and specific descriptions (ad nauseum) of Mr. Darcy's member and his connubial relations with Elizabeth. Elizabeth can't seem to go five minutes without her husband. There are also bastard sons galore peppered throughout this story. The characters are certainly darker and less virtuous than in the original and one can only wonder if Miss Austen would be horrified. The author's projection of Miss Austen's story is interesting, almost gossipy in places. But remember that this is a speculation of how the story might end should Miss Austen have written it so."
3,Very steamy novel,"So it's the steamier bedroom side of the continuation of Pride and Prejudice, post marriage. Darcy proves to have his talentsElizabeth is more than pleased, and the plot has some twists and turns. Could have been a little more well written, but entertaining all the same."
2,"Howbeit for some interesting ideas, this adaptation pains me betwixt the ears.","Berdoll has some interesting ideas, but the liberties that she takes with the characters are just too hard for me to accept. Plus, where was her editor? The liberal sprinklings of ""Howbeit"" and ""betwixt"" made me feel as if I ought to start playing a drinking game while reading this book.I also feel that the descriptions of the seedier side of Regency England were too jarring - Austen tended to write what she knew - it's rather unlikely she would have ventured into the ragamuffin world of prostitutes and stable-boys, or even write from the perspective of the servants or the poor.Still, I am not sure I could write any better. Everybody's a critic."
1,Can't stomach it.,"I love Jane Austen so much--it hurts. Linda Berdell became a fan of Jane Austen when she saw the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice in 2000. Four years later, she cranked out this little gem.It's clear that only four years of research.Literary scholars and English students have been studying Jane Austen for decades--yet Linda Berdell thinks she can just pick up where she left off--with not so much as a single bit of writing experience! It's laughable really.I'm disgusted that she turned the beautifully sculpted characters into cheap erotic fiction figures. I'm horrified.I'm even more horrified that I bought this book. I'm selling it immediately. I can't wait to get it off my bookshelf and out of my house."
1,A continuation of Pride and Prejudice???,"I gave this book one star only because I couldn't give it less. Jane Austin must be turning over in her grave. To recommend this book to people who enjoyed Pride and Prejudice is ridiculous! This is nothing but a trashy romance novel which borrows character names from Jane Austin. If you like Jane Austin, skip this book."
1,Don't bother,"Great characters are hard to create. When commenting on her own books, Jane Austen once said that the best authors are those who write what they know. In Austen's case, she was familiar with the drawing rooms and gardens of early 18th Century England. Consequently, her lovely characters, with their restrained dialogue and propriety, take the reader into their world. In her book, Ms. Berdoll did not succeed in poking fun at Austen's work, rather she simply showed the world how little she herself understood England in the 18th Century. Perhaps Ms. Berdoll should take Austen's advice and written only about what she knows---Texas in the 21st Century."
1,A disappointment,"Being a Jane Austen fan and an avid reader in general, I looked forward to reading this sequel. However, I was only 50 or so pages into it when I closed the book and returned it to the library. I was completely put off by the constant, overly descriptive, animal-like sex between the Darcys; I was annoyed by the dramatics (a man hiding in the woods lusting after Elizabeth?); I scoffed at the extreme portrayals of each character (Elizabeth is COMPLETELY sex-crazed, Jane is COMPLETELY prudish, Darcy thinks ONLY of Elizabeth). Finally, the language, in trying to be true to Austen, simply came off as complicated and tedious. This novel is coarse and undignified, nothing more than a cheap romance novel.If you want more in the Pride & Prejudice vein, I recommend Pamela Aidan's books. They are interesting, better written, and have insightful character development."
1,Should never have been published.,"The whole book reads as if the ridiculous character of Lydia Bennett were to write a book. The ego on this person to have believed she was capable of writing a sequel to anything written by Jane Austen. This ""novel"" is a complete joke. The author apparently never read or comprehended the original Pride & Prejudice, and had not a clue what the characters were about."
2,This is the kind of book that gives pornography a bad name,"If the writer wanted to create a bodice-ripping pastiche, why pick on poor Jane Austen? Why not Mrs. Gaskell or Wilkie Collins, someone whose prose was bad to begin with, where sexy updates could only be an improvement? Although, to be sure, the sexy updates would have to be a great deal less dreary than this sad attempt at erotica."
1,Painfully bad,"I love Jane Austen's novels, but this author is no Jane Austen.. As a Georgette Heyer devotee, too, and an English major who concentrated in 18th and 19th century women's literature, I am not daunted by archaic language, but this novel reads as if the author tried to make every statement as convoluted, complex and arcain as possible, even using words out of context just to make a sentance as ""18th centuryesque"" as possible.Really, I'd rather have a tooth pulled than read in graphic detail about the size of Darcy's unit or the soreness of Lizzie's girly bits. I mean, come on already! The love between them is depicted as more laughable cinemax-style soft core than passionate and heart wrenching.Really, there's nothing of Austen's original Pride and Prejudice here, just an abomination with characters bearing the same names."
1,no true continuation at all,"This book takes the great character study of Pride and Prejudice, with all its true romance and angst and resolution and turns it into a very very bad soap opera.Instead of romance, we have clinically explicit erotica. Instead of tension based on misjudged character, we have attempted rape and murder.Neither Darcy nor Elizabeth are true to their original portrayals, and the writing tries too hard to mimic period writing.Got this from the library; wish I hadn't. Fanfic is better.(*)>"
4,A must read,I really enjoyed reading this book. I love the desire Darcy and Elizabeth show for each other. I imagined Darcy would be very passionate and loving. Loved it!
1,Be Warned,This book is horrible. Jane Austen would die of shame reading this book. I did! It is way over the top. Do not buy it!!!!!!
4,"Hold on to Your Bonnets, Indeed!","Being a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, I was very wary of picking up any sequel to such a classic tale. Still, my heart was set on finding something that gave me a different perspective on my favorite story. This novel really hit the spot for me. While the writing may be too stylized and campy and the cast of other characters sometimes takes over the novel, I absolutely ADORED every scene between literature's favorite couple, Darcy and Lizzy. They were intimate, funny and made me think about them in a whole new light. As this was clearly meant to be a romance novel, the sex scenes were rather expected, and they did indeed sizzle. Overall, I couldn't put this book down and highly recommend it for anyone daring enough to dive into something new!"
4,A Happy thought indeed!,"No, this book was not written by Jane Austen but Ms. Berdoll gives her version of what she thought might have happened if the story continued. It was an entertaining read and a pretty good stabbed at it. I read it in two days. We all want Darcy and Elizabeth to go on forever. This is one woman's view of what might have happened. Give it a try!"
1,Disappointing under either title,"This book was originally before under the title ""The Bar Sinister."" It is quite disappointing under any name. Darcy has a complete change of character to a libidinous libertine with a wild past. The plot is dark, and contradicts the last few paragraphs of Austen's novel with its description of a slightly looser Darcy and a happy marriage. I have yet to see a ""Pride and Prejudice"" sequel (I've read them all) in which Darcy does not have a complete character change, but this is the most extreme and the most disappointing version of the married Darcy and Elizabeth."
1,Don't read if you respect the characters,"I enjoy Austen fan fiction. Heck, I even enjoy a good bodice ripper from time to time. And I was enjoying this combo for the first 22% of the book - even if they did have more sex than porn stars. There were even a few moments of genuine humor that made me smile. However, Darcy says something so crude before the ball at Pemberley that made me put the book aside. It's one thing to continue the Darcy's lives, including a few love scenes, but really? Was the vulgarity necessary?"
4,Realistic and better than the original,"I enjoyed this book more that the original as I felt it to be a much more realistic portrayal of the ""Regency"" era - i.e. a ""warts and all"" instead of a romanticised version of the times. I would like to think that this is how it turned out for the Darcys and their relations, friends and others."
3,Take it for what it is,"Take the book for what it is, a light-hearted, modern attempt to recreate the lives of much loved characters by fan. The book is at times laughable, very smutty, and extremely implausible, but quite enjoyable if you can get beyond it's attempt at being a sequel to one of the greatest works of literature. The only thing that really perturbed me was the authors perpetual use of latin and often wordy phrasing (my guess is an extensive use of a thesaurus). With that said, I really enjoyed Linda Berdoll's fantasy of the story and her take on what could have been. If people did not dearly love these characters, so many sequels would not exist."
1,laughable,"The true Jane Austen fan will find this attempt to carry on the story of Pride and Prejudice laughable. The characters seem to transform from Jane Austen's well developed and beloved heros and heroines to sex maniacs. This ""Pride and Prejudice meets Harlequin Romance"" was a complete disappointment. All of the romance is lost in the gobs and gobs of sex and the author's ridiculous use of language."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I read ""Pride & Prejudice"" once a year; never wanting it to end and always thinking:""...then what...?"". I inevitably look for the ""then what"" books"". I picked this up for weekend reading and just could not finish it. It was horrible, infantile, sloppy and, for lack of a better phrase, yucky. It was painful to read and couldn't finish it. Spent the rest of the weekend apologising to my eyes... If you're looking for the ""then what's"", don't look here. Disgrace to be associated with Jane Austen: Berdoll doesn't come close to language, style, plot, characterizations, etc. Maybe I'm better off with my dreams of ""...and then...?"". PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS (can you give a minus star?)"
1,Warning!!!,"I am not a Jane Austen purist. I say this because I know that a lot of Austen fans dislike all the sequels/prequels that are out there. Nothing comes close to Austen but I still enjoy reading how other people see these characters.Having said that, this book is complete and utter crap! It was so bad that I couldn't get past the first fifty pages and it's quite possibly the worst book I've ever attempted to read! You'd be better off buying yourself a smutty romance novel, at least that won't insult the memory of our beloved Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth."
1,Soft porn . . . . .,"I began reading this book knowing it wasn't going to be like the original, seeing as how it was a different author & years & years & years after the original. To say is was extremely disappointed, however, would be an understatement.This book was soft porn, nothing more. If you MUST read it check it out of your local library, don't waste your cash at the bookstore......"
1,Ridiculous,"This is an absurd adventure into the supposed Darcy bedroom. As others say, nothing more than dressed up porn and not very believable behavior. Gross spoilers to follow....At one point Darcy finds the dressed-up Lizzie, ready for a ball, and throws her up on a dresser and... well. And then he asks her not to bathe so she can feel it running down her legs all night. Ewww. Would Darcy ever do that???Then he brings a mirror into their bed, and our witty (not in this book) Lizzy looks at them being... in the marital way.... and says, ""It IS fascinating, isn't it?"" PUH-LEEZE. Lizzy also pouts when she realizes that this 30 some odd year old aristocrat husband of hers had other lovers, and gives him the third degree???? NOT something a respectable young wife and lady would do. IMHO.Just three examples that made me snort.Wish I had never bought this book."
1,If you love P&P DO NOT READ!!!,For those of you that love the palpapble tension between Lizzy and Darcy and are truly romantics at heart do not read this book. I am an avid believer in finishing books you start and I didn't even make it through 100 pgs before putting it on the shelf. This book turns Darcy and Lizzy into merely sexual fiends and downplays the romance and love that Jane Austen embued. It was raunchy enough to make me uncomfortable and there were things done that any true lover of Pride and Prejudice would never care to think of their beloved Darcy doing. The characters are written out of context and the back story of Darcy's life is wholly unbelievable and absurd.
1,Horrendous!,"Don't waste your time. If you're a JA fan, it's sacrilege.If you're not a JA fan, it's just garbage. Not even worthy of 1 star."
1,Romance Novel,"The only way this is equal to Pride and Prejudice is that Ms. Berdoll takes the characters and then puts them in the gutter.Jane Austen would be horrified.It really was the worst book I have read in a very long time.I was very dissapointed with it. Writting style was poor and very redundent. If I read one more howbeit, I would have screamed. I guess Ms. Berdoll thought that would make the book more period.Don't buy the book."
4,A Delightful Continuation of Pride and Preudice,"Not for the Jane Austin purist. However, for those of us who like to entertain extentions of the original plot, this book gives us further adventures of our favorite characters. It also adds some new characters, some delightful, some evil in the extreme.The only faults I found in the story, concern incorrect details relating to story elements in Pride and Prejudice. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, Lydia's dowery amount is given as 50 pounds per annum, rather than 100 pounds per annum. The second error concerns Mr Collins, who is identified as Mr. Bennett's nephew, when he is Mr. Bennett's cousin.Other than these details, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
3,More Romance Novel than anything else.,"This reads mostly like a romance novel. While it is a fun read, it is not Jane Austen. Character development is lacking, and much of the plot is not believable for the characters from Pride and Prejudice."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"While not a literary classic, it is a wonderful book for all Pride and Prejudice movie (and possibly novel) fans. Like other reviewers have said, it is both very sexual (most of it at the beginning) and very entertaining. This book does not have one dull moment. Darcy and Elizabeth's marriage is very passionate, loyal, and genuine and therefore would satisfy any romantic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thorougly enjoyed the novel or movie. It gives much more closure then the first book. My only complaint is that the author kills off a ton of people, sometimes it seemed quite unnecessary. Also, the character of Georgianna is way off. I did not like her character when I finished the book. Other than that, again, it is a GREAT GREAT book. It was SO romantic!"
1,Mr Darcy takes a wife,"Wished I had not bought this book.Too long and there were nothing but endless sexual encounters with each other. The Elizabeth in Jane Austen novel was gone as far as her headstrong character.Mr Darcy seems to be floundering, if he is not in bed with his wife.Wished I had paid some attention to the negative review this book had received."
3,"Entertaining, if a far cry from Austen's wit","In accordance with many earlier reviews, I agree that the heavy dose of ""howbeit""s and ""betwixt""s were more affectation that emulation. However, if one is seeking just an escapist tale of the continued life of Elizabeth and Darcy, this was an entertaining story. P&P; is a fantastic novel in that it at once sketches the inner observations of a clever beautiful woman counterposed by her outward behavior. The A&E; adaptation, while nicely done, is less introspective. Ms. Berdoll's novel is not introspective in the least. It would seem, given her portrayal of Darcy's virility and generous anatomy, that his subconscious is constantly made evident by his visible arousal. Quite heavy-handed compared with the delicacy of the original novel!In sum, if you like the characters of Elizabeth and Darcy and their acquaintances, you may find this story a fun read. Just don't go looking for the same degree of subtlety as is found in Austen."
3,If you are a true P&P fan....it will do for now.,"This book was average. I was bored with the first couple chapters. Berdoll uses way to many (parenthesis) to try to explain another thought. I think it took away from what was trying to be said. I understand the era was hard to live in but I wasn't ready to face the reality of what she does to ""Lizzy"". She tortures and torments the mind, body and soul of these beloved charactors. If you are like me and need P&P;, well.... buy this, it will keep you wanting to read more.I enjoyed the book. But, perfer Aiden's rendition for Darcy.I truly hope that Pamela Aiden decides to keep her 3 book series alive."
2,graphic and boring,"I don't consider myself a prude, and I was prepared for a considerably more erotic treatment of the characters than Austen's, but this book turned me off, not on. The graphic sexual descriptions left nothing to the imagination, and the characters' inability to control themselves makes them seem moronic and juvenie, not passionate. I could have passed on the description of how the blood-spattered sheet from Darcy and Elizabeth's wedding night ended up displayed in a local inn. (This is supposed to be romantic?) And, as a couple of other reviewers have indicated, the tedious and stilted writing style makes you skip ahead to see if anything ever happens besides sex."
2,Mr. Darcy Takes His Wife...,"I happened upon this as the local library and couldn't resist thumbing through. It's definitely a knee-slapper! The plot is contrived and silly, and the author apparently thinks that starting every other sentence with the word ""Pray"" makes her sound like Austen. The prose is completely overwrought, the author substitutes endless parenthetical descriptions for actual exposition, and though I do tip my hat to her never ending well of euphamisms for the sex act and organs, the boot-knocking got to be a bit much after a while. I agree with others--this is essentially very smutty fanfiction. A fun diversion, perhaps, but could never seriously considered in the same league as the original work."
1,Disgusting,"If you are a true Jane Austen fan, this is a must avoid. It seems to be nothing but a cheap, pornographic romance novel trying to disguise itself as literature. It would satisfy the intellect of an adolescent 15yr. old boy reading it in the bushes and snickering with his friends. I only got to about page 25,had enough, and removed it from my Kindle. The author states that since Jane Austen was never married she could not know or understand sex or the intimacy of true love. I'm not sure the author does either.I am thankful that Amazon has the sample option for it's books and that I didn't waste any money on this.There are better sequels to P & P out there. Skip this one."
3,Too Much,"I have recently begun reading ""sequels"" to Pride & Prejudice and decided I would take a chance on this one (especially because it was on sale). The story, while compelling, is just too much for me. First, the archaic language which I got through only thanks to Amazon for the internal dictionary in the Kindle. Second, the melodrama; there were so many seriously sad events which is part of the reason why I stopped reading Diana Gabaldon. If I wanted to be depressed so badly - wait, nope I don't. Last, there were so many side stories and digressions into other peoples memories and thoughts that it detracts from the main characters (and even the important supporting characters). If you like complicated, drama-laden novels, then this one should be great; however, if you want a satisfactory continuation of P&P you should look elsewhere."
1,Painful and Contrived,"Flat characterizations very, very loosely based on Austen's novel, and lots of very silly, contrived bedroom scenes. I can't even be bothered to write a proper review for this one. Suffice to say it is dull, out of character, and very ridiculous. The only thing it has in common with P&P is the character names. Quite unworthy to be called a sequel."
1,Trashy romance novel,"Why ruin a perfectly good story? You know, sequels are never as interesting as the original. This story and its characters belonged to Jane Austen, who knew and understood life in that time period expecially everyday life for women. She lived it! She didn't have the privilege to use ""sex fillers"" in a book . It would have bee considered totally inappropriate, and would have never been published."
4,"Very fun, though her thesaurus must be aching","I have no problem with the sex, as most of the reviewers have. Look at this book for what it is -- a quasi-trashy romance novel based on Jane Austen's characters -- it's a rollicking roll in the hay. If you enjoy Jane Austen and don't mind her characteres being connected with the utterly profane, this book is for you. However, if you are uncomfortable reading about Eliza's booty being tired after her wedding night, this book is not for you.Stylistically it's a little amateurish and laughable at times -- Linda Berdoll obviously used a thesaurus extensively in an attempt to inject some less-modern language, and failed to bring it close to Austen's writing. To me, however, Berdoll's fearless plotline, sense of humor, and hot sex scenes (my boyfriend agrees) make it easily worth four stars. She obviously doesn't take herself too seriously at all, which is sympathetic to Austen's core esthetic values."
2,(sigh),Where do I start? I really wanted to like this book.... really. But my oh my. I don't recognize this iteration of Lizzie from Lizzie in P&P.; And I'm only on page 154.Am very sorry that I started this book. It made me doubt why I loved the original characters.
4,More Drama Than Austen Would Have Ever Used--but good,"I'm a little shocked that anyone would describe this book as 'sophmoric' since I found it more along the lines of ""Gone With The Wind"". Take Austen's style and add sex and high drama. All intimacy is handled under enough flowery vocabulary to assure the reader has to check twice to understand what really happened!! It was quite a ride and certainly a romp by the time I got through this book but I have to say it made me laugh outloud in various places. It was also extremely poignant and sad. This story will be hard to stomach for any true Austen-ite but it's a good read. Her attention to detail is phenomenal and she breathes more life into the characters than I found in Austen's book. (sacrilige, I know!)"
5,Loved It,I absolutely love Pride and Prejudice and this was the first time that I had picked up a continuation of it. I thoroughly enjoyed it and could barely put it down. I can't wait to start reading Darcy and Elizabeth.
2,"Great sex scenes, but other then that meh","Got it at a used book store. It was an ok book, no need to read it again. If you are looking to take a book to the beach, this might be good for for this, but I doubt anyone will read it more then once."
1,I wish I'd read the reviews before I picked up the book,"I saw this book at the used bookstore a week or so ago and as a Pride & Prejudice fan, thought it would be fun to read. Oh how I wish that I had read these reviews before buying because it is a dreadful book. Dull, slow, cheap trash, just one of the worst books I've ever tried to read . I'm usually one who finishes a book no matter how terrible, but I'm not so sure I can keep dragging through this one. Don't buy it!"
2,What a folly...indeed!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. Yet as I will read anything related to Pride and Prejudice and I cannot get enough,I finished it. Although many a mind wanders as what their intimate life was like, this was much to rough and left nothing to the imagination. I think my imagination did a better job than this book has of their intimate relationship and was much more sensual. Hey maybe I'll write a sex-quel."
3,Not the way I would have written it...,"I'd like to first say that the e-book has no problems in getting to me. It is simply the book I was not satisfied with. This was an interesting take on ""what happens after?"" in Pride & Prejudice but it is definitely not the way I would have written it. Elizabeth was not the fiery woman I read about in the real P&P and Darcy was definitely not the gentleman. The end felt rushed and surreal. I did like the angst Berdoll created in Elizabeth having children and she did a good job writing the lengthy piece. But, even as an English major, I had to pull out a dictionary to understand over half of it (feels like someone used the thesaurus a lot). All in all, its not the way I would have imagined the ""happily ever after"" but it is written well and Berdoll obviously worked very hard on this book, which is laudable. Warning: There is (somewhat) explicit material in the bedroom scenes. Not appropriate for younglings."
2,Virility in the description..well I guess that sets the tone,I just felt this was way beyond what is in good taste. I felt like several others who said why waste the money or the time.
1,ABSOLUTELY AWEFUL!!!,"If I had a dollar for everytime the author used ""betwixt"" instead of between I'd be a millionaire.It was so annoying.I am totally disappointed in this book.In fact I didn't make it through chapter 3 before I put it down.The spirit of the characters were lost and as one reviewer said some of the behaviors and things said by Elizabeth and Darcy I couldn't imagine them saying it.And to have Bingley have an affair on Jane, I don't believe that would have ever had happened. If he was as much in love with her as the original story portrays he never would have ventured outside their marriage.In fact I was so confused when I first started this book. I thought the author was going to start off AFTER the marriage, but she didn't. She started the story prior to them getting married which threw me totally off and left me uninterested at the start.CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK?"
2,A Despicable Sequel,So much of the romance of the original novel is that it leaves much to the imagination. This sequel certainly does not. This book is nothing more than literary porn disguised as a sequel to a classic.
1,A waste of money...,"If you are even remotely interested in this book, check it out of the library. I began reading last night and echo the sentiments in others' disappointed reviews. I found myself skimming pages to find the plot...annoyed that I spent limited after-the-kids-are-in-bed reading time on a trash novel billed as a sequel with ""rich character development"". If you are an Austen fan, steer clear of this one."
1,Disgusted!!,"I found the content hard to muddle through and was quite disgusted with each liason between Darcy and Elizabeth. This is nothing more that soft porn. God forbid that my teenage daughters get a hold of this. Besides it was a bit much to assume that their marriage would continue to have such ""coitus"" after several years and two children (book 2). I felt like they were in the ""honeymoon"" stage of marriage through the whole story."
1,"Same character names, no other relationship to Jane Austen's work","This author should have given her characters new names, instead of stealing those from Jane Austen's work, because this novel is in no way a sequel to Pride and Prejudice.The whole style is so different from Jane Austen's, that it is bizarre to consider this a sequel. Anyone pretending to write a sequel to another author' work (without that author's permission) should at least make some attempts to learn what that author had stated about the future lives of those characters, and this author clearly has not. She ignores everything the author said about her characters, both in the original work, and later statements about future developments, and creates completely new personalities, with the old characters' names.This is just the sort of melodramatic type of story that Jane Austen would mock. She must be rolling over in her grave, to have her beloved creations co-opted in such a fashion."
2,Tiresome and oversexed,"I think the desire to continue the Darcy-Elizabeth romance, and yes, consummate it, is understandable. And since I bought the book, I obviously wanted to read something like this. But ultimately, this book left me flat and I stopped reading it. Sort of a bad bodice ripper with WAAAY too much sex. Not because it's offensive and I'm a prude, but the reason we cared so much about Elizabeth and Darcy was their wit, their chemistry...their longing and sparring. And somehow, reducing them to two energetic sex puppies is just a bit much. Not romantic, just trashy."
4,Enjoyable and Entertaining,"I can see why the Austen purists are bombing this book to kingdom come, but personally, I thought it was entertaining. I like the fact that Berdoll displayed Elizabeth overcoming hardships, which I didn't think were all that excessive... well, perhaps the kidnapping was a bit overdone. But childbirth, dealing with her husband's past affairs, etc. were probably things many women went through during Austen's time. But what do I know? Maybe I'm just talking out of my bum.At any rate, I personally enjoyed the book very much. And though the sex might have been overdone, it's very nice to think that Darcy and Elizabeth enjoyed a healthy sex life. Nice job, Berdoll."
4,This is a great book...but not even close to a good sequel for P&P.,"I really enjoyed the story, its alot different from all the other sequels...but it is not innocent minds! In some parts of the book it gets a little vulgar but if you just skip through them...you'll really enjoy it!"
2,Clan of the... Pemberly?,"Contains spoilers.I figured it out. This book is like Ayla and Jondalar in waistcoats and petticoats. The passionate virgin, the gentle and skilled lover with large parts, the younger sister with a mind of her own, a knack for healing, the question if his seed is strong enough to take root in her womb... it's all there. With a slight lapse into Star Wars territory--I seem to recall that it is Leia and Han who first have the romantic exchange, ""I love you."" ""I know.""Betwixts and howbeits aside, I personally got tired of Lothario and melancholia. It's just another trashy romance novel, all in all. Not enough to get upset about... this book can't really alter anyone's long-term perceptions of favorite Austen characters. They just happen to all have the same names."
1,Thank Goodness Jane Austen will never read this !!!,"This is not a continuation of Pride and Prejudice. This is a soft porn bodice ripper with characters of similar names to the Jane Austen classic. If Ms. Berdoll actually believes Mr. Darcy would be so disgusting to use a chamber pot in Lizzy's presence she needs to read Jane Austen. She lost me for good when the newlyweds had sex on a blanket outdoors IN JANUARY, in view of a servant. I could read no more, as I could not stand the idea of Jane Austen's characters being reduced to classless libertines. Don't waste money on this one!"
1,Eschew Obfuscation,"Avoid this book - perhaps try the Elizabeth Aston books instead.__________________Honestly! I have a decent vocabulary & am quite the fan of the ""correct"" word, but it seems Linda Berdoll is flaunting that she owns an OED! (see quotations in other reviews)But much more annoying than that are the parentheticals describing characters personalities. I'm pretty sure Jane Austen used the characters actions & conversation to allow the reader to form her own opinion, rather than ramming it down your throat._______________________________________________"
1,Trash,"I don't think that the author's inability to imitate Austen's work is what infuriates ""Austenites"". The main problem is that the author doesn't understand the subtleties and humor of writing. She relied on sensationalism and voyueristic detail to tell the story and left nothing to the imagination. She obviously did not do enough research about the time period or P&P; itself before embarking on this embarassment, but her real problem is that she doesn't know how to write.I would love to read a spicy, well-written, multifaceted sequel to P&P...this; unfortunately is NOT it."
4,Dreamscape,I had seen this movie about 10 years ago and I really enjoyed to see it again in a reasonable price
3,Useful,"Not quite as high as expected, but it serves the purpose.I bought it mainly for roasting breadfruit on the stovetop."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,Was hoping this would help me simmer items on gas stove without them boiling....probably needed to order a bigger size.
2,Booooooring,"All I have to say about this book is ""Does this girl ever shut-up! "" Yeah, yeah so the plot is new and different, but it takes more than a good plot to make a love story that makes your heart pound. She is soooo annoying I was sick of her. All she ever did was wine and worry. Why don't you just stand up for your self and get a life? If you want an actually good book try ""I Do"" by Elizabeth Chandler."
1,So predictable,"This book was soooo predictable. I hated how she always had a chip on her shoulder and the world was against her. And Jordan was such a great guy,and she treated him so badly. If you really want to read a good book try I Do or At First Sight by Elizabeth Chandler!"
2,"Take the original Civ, and add to it, rather than improve","The graphics are poor at best, they are slightly better than the original Civ. Microprose have tried to improve them and failed. Game play on my very fast system is slow, and not really a lot of improvements to the game. The move from Civ to CivII was great. However this version lets down the gaming series.After a while you will get use to the poor graphics and play it, but you'll be thinking about Civ II."
1,Dissappointing follow-up,"I loved Civ and Civ II but Test of Time is a Waste of Time. The new graphics make piece movement difficult for it is difficult, first to figure out which piece you're moving, then it's hard to figure out what kind of piece you're moving.The city interface is clumsy and difficult to figure out if you're used to Civ and Civ II. I recommend you buy a copy of Civ II instead."
1,Poor graphics,Poor resolution. 800x600 is probably maximum. Does not scale to larger screen. I cannot easily tell one unit from another
1,If you like your civ with sickly purple oceans.,"Blasphemy! They took the Civ2 engine and put some graphics on top of the old graphics. After about 20seconds the new graphics start to disentigrate and you see the old Civ2 underneath. Buy Civ2-Multiplayer Gold,it is the same game and it doesn't crash every 2 minutes."
4,Interesting variation - somehow confusing graphics,"Test of Time uses the same game engine as Civ II, the differences are more complex graphics and extended game possibilities: the game doesnt stop with the colonists reaching the planet, you can continue to colonize it and get in contact with alien civilization who can establish colonies on Earth. The only real difference to CIV II is that the game is longer and played on two maps, but the essence stays strictly the same... Its the same for the different environments offered (science-fiction, fantasy).All in all as good as CIV II, with some more possibilities, making you sit even longer in front of the computer...Even though it was a nice intention to beef up the graphics, I do think that this version of CIV is less easy to play, the units less easy to recognize... Its simply confusing. If you want to play your game fast, CIV II does a better job."
1,Buy Civ2:MPG - no improvements of merit in this product,"Civ-2 Multiplayer Gold added multiplayer to Civ-2 - that was a needed improvement. This iteration uses the Microsoft Direct-X Libraries to slow gameplay to a crawl, while adding little of significance to game play. Buy the (now) much cheaper Civ-2:MPG."
1,Yuck,"A pale imitation of the real thing, basically a retread with bad graphics, muddy scenes, more bells and whistle with no real innovation, a waste of money"
2,Save your money for Sid Meier's Civ III,"I've been a long-time fan of the Civ games, but this ""update"" of Civ II left me seriously disappointed. The graphics leave alot to be desired - they are no better than in the older Civ II product, and in several instances, are worse.Since Sid Meier left them to join Firaxis, they have done nothing to improve the product at all. I am happy to see that Sid Meier is doing Civ III (and of course, Alpha Centauri, the follow-up to CivIII, which is also a GREAT game). I'd really suggest you get Civ III, and try Alpha Centauri if you can find it."
4,Civ 2 in a new box,"Civ 2:Test of Time(TOT) is a great game! If you own the original Civ 2, you may at first think that you bought the same game over again. The game offers the option to play past the spaceship landing and allows you to colonize a far away planet. You now have a sci-fi and fantasy world. The biggest difference overall is that you now have multiple maps that are placed on top of each other. Think of layers on a cake. You can move from the top to the bottom. The graphics are a little prettier, but not a lot. The gameplay is identical to Civ 2. I'd recomened that you buy Civ 2 Gold Multiplayer Edition. It comes with dozens of great scenarios not playable in TOT. Civ fans should pick this up"
4,Awesome Action,"This is my first time encountering Civilization. After reading some of the reviews, I find this game to be great. The action is non stop. You are constantly kept thinking to keep your society on top. I think though if I had been on the band wagon from the beginning, I would not have purchased this version becasue of its similiarities to the first two games. But coming where I did, new to the Civilization experience, I think its a great bargain with the three different scenarios you can play."
4,Fun pop culture trivia game,"I got this game in 2004 when it came out. University games released this and Beat the Experts in that year. This game is better. You answer questions in one of four categories for each of the decades. The decades are from the 1960s to the 1990s. Dead or Alive and Hot or Not give you a 50/50 shot. Correct answers earn you chips to put on your Bingo-style card. Complete any two rows, across, up and down or diagonally to win the game.I find this game better than Times to Remember, a game Milton Bradley put out in the early 90s. It covered the 50s through the 80s. I lived through the decades that Blast From The Past covers. A good game where memories of those decades will probably come back to you."
3,Set of cards for 90's questions not included,"The game is fun...would have been better if the 90's cards had not been omitted. Guess someone was asleep at their job. Recommend it, and if you decide to purchase one, I hope you get the entire game."
1,disappointed,"this was my first straight razor, so i thought it was normal to shred my face every time i used it, since i was still learning. i just didn't see what i was doing wrong, my angles seemed ok, my speed was ok, i use really nice shaving soap, i always showered first to soften up my whiskers... i didn't want to give up on straight razors, but also didn't want to pony-up big bucks for the uber-expensive ones. so i bought another disposable straight razor, a parker w/ stainless steel handle. so much better.i think the biggest problem with the monsieur charles is the blades. they have very sharp corners. also, they are not held tightly in the slide-style blade holder.i wish this razor was better, it looks awesome. but it just isn't. the parker, i highly recommend. the monsieur... best to avoid. or at least buy some styptic pencils. lots of them."
2,Not the best option,"This is a pretty good razor, but oddly enough, the handle will be damaged if it goes into disinfectant. The handle is plastic but it must be different than the plastic in the combs."
2,Get this author a copy editor please!,"While the content over all is good, this book is one tough dog to plod through considering all the spelling and grammatical errors. Sadly with this many errors the author has gone SPLAT! in this reader's eyes."
5,Bullseye - right on the mark!,"Why is SPLAT! the perfect book for any company? It's Relatable-everyone ""gets it."" Who hasn't experienced the painful consequences of being ""dropped"" by people they were hoping would come through as promised? Mark has a natural gift and practical experince to provide simple solutions to comples age old issues - Bullseye!Greg CortopassiPresident and founder of Launch Your Dreams and TeamWorks Training Corporation"
5,These cats rock,"Charlie Baty and Rick Estrin have kept this good thing going for decades. This is a great album from their Alligator recordings and should please both those new to the group and those already familiar.Little Charlie & the Nightcats falls somewhere between two other great entertainers, Macia Ball and Louis Jordan. All know how to get their audience clapping their hands and moving their feet. In addition, this group (like Ball and Jordan) entertains with their lyrics as well as tight arrangements. Solid chops from all in the band with harmonica and guitar carrying the day.They play in a wide range of pleasing styles as other reviewers have noted. In most, they are saying: ""Don't take life too seriously; enjoy what your can; laugh at the rest; and, be in the moment.""Works for me."
5,Life-Changing Prayer,"This book is really life-changing, at least from my own experience. I bought copies for relatives, I was so excited about the power of praise and thanksgiving as shown in this book. Try it - I hope you like it."
4,Very good and uplifting,This book has a different approach to prayers. It mainly concentrates in praising GOD under all circumstances. It is a very good book.
3,"Okay, but not great","This book is okay, but not great. She spends so much time quoting Jack Hayford he should get a cowriting credit.I was looking for more meat. This one is pretty light weight."
5,Keeps Debris Out,Great product - keeps debris out of your car. The filter traps all debris and you have a smoother ride.
5,Leapster and Nemo game,"I purchased the Leapster 2 and the Nemo game for my 3 year old grandson. He really enjoys the toy and the game. After seeing the movie ""Nemo"" he really enjoyed the game. The only difficulty my daughter has had with the toy is trying to download an additional ""free"" game."
3,Underwhelmed,"I just purchased this game today to go with my daughter's new Leapster 2. My daughter is 2.5 years old and was bored with it in less than 1 hour. She is a huge Finding Nemo fan, and I had high expectations for this game, but we are not impressed. She quickly mastered the first level of 3 out of 4 games. The game that uses sound to find the fish is the most lame game of all! She refused to entertain this game. Her ""favorite"" game is the jellyfish bouncing game. All in all, this was my first Leapster cartridge purchase so I hope the other 3 games I purchased are better than this. I truly hoped that this would be an entertaining game for her. Sorry!"
5,Game review,Highly recommend this game. I have a five year old and he loves it. Can play this game all by himself without any help from me.
4,Finding Nemo Game,"I think this was fun, but my daughter found it a bit difficult and it is not her favorite, but her friend thinks it is just the best thing ever."
3,Leapster game,"There was nothing to this game what a waist of time and what a waist of money! No not to happy with this game. No counting , no numbers just. Cheap game no wonder there so many of them!! KC."
1,NOT NEW,"As soon as I got the game is it obvioulsy not new even though is say on the package that it is. The label indicting it was ""new"" was even taped on. The cover has a dent in it, dusty and has crusty stuff on it. I am very disspointed that amazon would even consider this acceptable."
2,Mom'sreview,I was disappointed in the lack of games on this cartridge as well as the story. There are only 4 games on this cartridge which are not very interesting or exciting. My daughter also has the Disney Princess and Dora Cartridges which are far superior in overall content and games. She really enjoyes the karoke game with the Disney Princess cartridge where she can sing along with Aerial and the Fairy Godmother. The games on the Princess and Dora are also more educational.
4,Good Game,Bought this for my daughter for christmas and she likes it very much. Has some help learning for her which is a plus.
4,A Tasty Treat.,"Simply put, the book is engaging, informative, and hilarious. Buford's enthusiasm for the high-stress world of commercial cuisine, as well as the more familiar infatuation with Tuscan peasant cooking, is incredibly contagious.It's been said that the book is overwrought and self-indulgent--I didn't find it to be either. Anyone at a high school literacy level should feel comfortable with this writing. Buford writes entertainingly and unselfconsciously about his own experiences. He embellishes and plays with the language. I don't know about you, but I prefer my meat juicy."
3,Hate to Rain On The Parade.......,"....but I thought this book was just ""OK"". By way of background, I love to read, I love to cook and several of my well read friends highly praised this book. Perhaps in that sense my expectations were inflated. I also read the book on the beach and couldn't seem to read more than 10 pages at a time without being distracted by something -so I may have ""chopped it up"" a bit.That said I felt it was pretty slow moving and repetitious at times. I found Battali to be an amusing wild man most of the time and in general I found the ""behind the scenes"" look at restaurants interesting (although a bit depressing - while the people involved have a singular passion for food the actual production of it in a restaurant came off as profit driven drudgery). The search for ""food roots"" in Italy was again interesting but overdone.There are worse books out there for sure - but I just didn't see why this one is all the rage"
3,"editor, edit thyself","This is a charming 200 page book. After that it becomes tedious and meandering and in the end a real slog to finish. Buford's obsession for the ""jus just"" is funny and entertaining for about 2/3 of the story. After that it becomes mired in uninteresting anecdotes and trivia (historically when did the egg get added to the recipe for pasta is intriguing for half a page, not ten)that overcooks by many hours the final product. He is the kind of writer who thinks everything that interests him will interest you, but he is wrong. Perhaps a better writer could have pulled that off, but Buford is an editor who is writing a book about his love for cooking and in the end that distinction shows. What begins as a love letter from an obsessive becomes in the end the ramblings of a self indulgent food flaneur."
5,Cooking,If you have a passion for cooking this is a great book. If you love Italian food this is a great book.
2,A little dissapointed,"I found this to be a very slow read. I love food books and the stories of people with food, but I found this to be very borring. I'm not sure why I finished it, I guess I just kept hoping it would get better and pull me in. It wasn't a bad story, just very slow."
2,"Same story, different book.","I love to read narrative books on food. I also love to read cookbooks. But to me, this book is too similar to the more entertaining ""Kitchen Confidential."" I have no problem with the actual writing of the book, Buford is a great an enthusiastic guide to the inner workings of a kitchen. But I am tired of reading about how hellish and stressful it is to work in a restaurant kitchen, and glorifying the macho boys club of the professional culinary world. Yes, we get it, it's not really all that glamorous to work in a restaurant day in and day out. If you have never read a book like this and are infatuated with Mario Batali, I say go ahead and read it, but if you have read ""Kitchen Confidential,"" there's not much new here."
4,Heat is Hot,"If you like to eat, cook, or dine out, read this. You'll get fun facts on the restaurant biz, including real-life, bigger-than-life characters. If you are squeamish about food you may want to pass, as the info you get on the inner workings of restaurants, the food they serve, and how they prepare it may be than you want to know. Buford and his new food buddies are a fascinating lot, and if I could figure out how he managed this adventure financially, I'd try it myself!"
2,Dissapointing,"The book has three themes (interwoven throughout the book). Mario's kitchen, training in Italy, and a look into the history/evolution of cooking.When in Mario's kitchen, it's an entertaining read (Even if Mario B isn't a person I'd ever want to hang out with).The training in Italy is generally disappointing with very slow meandaring sections.Finally, the trips through history will only appeal to a VERY serious foodie.I was, perhaps mistakenly, looking for a fun read and never even chuckled. There must have been better stories to relate than what he's produced."
2,Not so much,"This book is boring. I suspect that most of the people who loved it were reading their first ""inside"" look at restaurant kitchens, either that or liked the Mario Batale stuff. But the book just drags and the author injects no life at all into 80% of the narrative. Go read Bourdain's first book instead (and then drop all things Bourdain, also)."
3,Delicious,"A good read, fun and a good pace. Desirable reading for foodies, but more detailed information on how to take apart and process a pig would have been helpful."
1,"Erratic, boring and without passion","This book reads like a term paper written by an overly diligent student who's not really interested in his subject. The author erratically jumps from one topic to another to demonstrate that he has really done lots and lots of research.The result lacks insight, excitement and passion.Of course anybody seriously interested in the world of food and cuisine already knows how a professional kitchen ticks. Much better books about journalists' work experiences have been written - experiences in greater restaurants!: e.g. Andrew Todhunter's ""A Meal Observed"". This author worked serveral months at the legendary Taillevent in Paris (3 Michelin stars).Read the latter and forget HEAT! The cover whets one's appetite but what follows leaves the reader hungry. Very hungry in fact!"
5,An interesting idea executed flawlessly.,"An interesting idea executed flawlessly. I like Bourdain, I really do, but the reader inside of me always wished to be eating at Les Halles rather than reading his sometimes self-reverential prose. Now Buford is a writer-turned-chef, so his strong suite, writing rather than cooking, benefits anyone who digs in to read Heat. I don't know what captivated me more, his journey from kitchen cook to line chef or the inside look into Mario's world. My suggestion, read the book and go to Babbo when you finish, you'll enjoy the Barbequed Squab even more."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable read for all foodies,"The story meanders a little, but for the most part, this a very enjoyable, page-turner read."
5,Great Book !!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I found the history of Italian food a surprising treat! I also enjoyed the description and events surounding the author's meetings with Mario B., they are very fun and entertaining!!"
3,Need to be a real cook to appreciate ...,"I moderately liked this book. It was most entertaining when describing Mario Batali. And, his journey was interesting at times, but during those periods it had a hard keeping my attention. I think you need to be real cook to apprecaite this book in its entirety. The ending wasn't much to speak of either. I was hoping all my hard work getting through the tough patches for me would pay off in the end."
5,Armchair Sous Chef,"Having spent hours watching the Food Channel: Iron Chef America, Throwdown and even Rachael Ray, one always thinks that it doesn't look so hard...that is until you try to accomplish medium dice of anything with a consistent size. Somehow anything I chop looks as even as if I had done it in a food processor. So why don't I use one you ask?? Because they don't on Iron Chef America, they slice and dice with ease.Slice and dice with ease is what Bill Buford has done with this book. It is a delight. He has done what I no longer need to--quit my job and work for Mario Batali. Mario is portrayed as what you would love him to be, fun, food loving, hard drinking, razor sharp, intelligent as all get out....an absolute wild man.The stories are racous, hysterical, and wonderful. I laughed out loud and was so so sorry when it was over.Read this book!!!! Until they dye Jack Black's hair red and throw him in a paid of red clogs for the movie it is the most fun you will have in a kitchen."
3,I'll never eat out again.,"OK, that was an overstatement. I will eat out again, but not at any of the places in this book. With larger-than-life characters and a lively writing style,this book was an enjoyable read. However, I found myself squirming a lot over the grossness of the various kitchens Buford worked in. Ignorance was bliss.This book was a selection of our book club and everyone enjoyed it (there are a fair number of foodies in our club, which obviously influenced things).One good thing, it completely cured me of wanting my own restaurant."
4,Will the journey end here?,"My hat off to Bill Buford for compiling an amazing tale of food, history, and travel through his personal experiences. I enjoyed the book so much I did not want it to end. The ending, without giving away too much, states that he will continue his journey by following Italian cookery into France to explore French origins and if there is indeed a relationship between French and Italian food history.I would like to know, ""will Bill produce a sequel to HEAT?"". Bill, if you are reading this, I imagine your journey will not end in France, as through your research you will end up in Sicily. Looking forward to more of Bills' great work."
3,Overcooked,"Well sure, the ~meat~ of this book is interesting. But as sometimes happens in the kitchen, it suffers from just too much loving attention. Buford should have just served it simply and let it sizzle.The writing is full of self-indulgent rambles. Parentheses and dashes abound. I would not describe it as unreadable, merely as inconsiderate. If the reader is undistracted and reads along with lawyerly concentration, he might never lose the thread. But he if he is reading casually along in an unsecluded spot, he surely will, from time to time, find himself hopelessly lost in a sentence of Faulkneresque proportions. Clarity and readability just do not appear to be valued here."
3,Best for Cooks,"Perhaps the only reviewers so far were people really interested in food preparation and/or restaurants. The book was mildly entertaining. I especially enjoyed the inserts of history. Thought the pig butchery in a NY apt. was a bit over the top. I never grew to like all the characters or even understood the personalities. If you are a gourmat this book has potential. But if you enjoy food on a more normal level, then this is a time investment that will entertain but is not mouth watering."
3,Why the Fuss?,"Any earlier reviewer said it best: ""the ramblings of a self indulgent food flaneur"". I had high hopes for this book, as I found Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential entertaining and educational, but after the nth repetition of ""I just have to go to Italy to learn X"" I lost patience with the author. It may have been meant to show his devotion to Italian food, but it struck me as showing off: ""I'll go spend a few months working without pay [great deal for the restauranteurs] in an obscure rural village for A Character who will teach me A Great Truth"". This is supposed to show true devotion for the cuisine: nice gig if you can afford it.The book did start off well, and if he had published his experiences as a layman in a commercial restaurant as an article in the New Yorker it would have been a better read. As it's published, he comes across like a chef who piles on truffles, fois gras and caviar on everything until the poor diner shouts Basta! Enough!"
3,"Good, but not what I was expecting","I enjoy Iron Chef America so when I saw this book on Amazon I thought it would be fun to read about life working with Mario Batali. I guess I was expecting something else, because there was not as much about working with Mario as I thought there would be. Having said that, I did find out that Mario had a colorful youth, and some of the language is equally colorful. It was an eye opener - at least for me - as to what goes on in the kitchen and what it takes to work your way up through the ranks of the kitchen to become a chef. Well written; a fun and enjoyable read. I was just expecting something else from the description."
4,banjo,"Very good biography! One has to be interested in cooking and food. AT parts more detail than I want to know, but the book is fascinating, educational and humourous. Highly recomend it."
1,Repetitive and boring,"I usually love books like this and this one promised to be good because of the writer's journalism background and the interesting subject matter. Boy was I disappointed. He basically tells the same story over and over again. Buford struggles with making lamb chops, Buford struggles with making polenta, etc. There is no story arch, no real beginning or end. Just endless, identical stories. All of the other chefs seem to be stock players, with no true identity. I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through."
1,Awful,"Save yourselves (and your money)! This is one of the most boring books I've ever come across. It should be retitled Ode to Mario Batali since that is the only thing the author can write about, wasting line upon line listing stupid quotes from Mario. This book makes watching grass exciting."
1,Heat,"I was so disappointed with the language in this book. I had heard about it on the NPR ""Splendid Table"" show and looked forward to reading it. What a waste of good money. I can't get past the first 30 pages because of the filthy language. I was insulted to have squandered money on filth. If Mario Batali can't open his mouth with every other word beginning with ""f"", I certainly wouldn't want to eat his food as it must be as filthy as his language. Wish I could get a refund."
2,Disappointed,The pages of this book were cut randomly so the item is a second. Although new it obviously looks cheap.
5,A Great Book - A Little Weird Though,"I'm just finishing this book. Since I enjoy Italian topics in stories I had a good time with this one. It jumps back and forth from NYC to the Italian country side.The topic is certainly not a norm for me. Being a line cook, a chef, or a pasta-maker has never occurred to me as a compelling choice for a career. But the writing overcomes all that. You get involved in the story.If like food, resturants, Italy, you won't be disappointed."
3,Has all the right ingredients but...,"This is an interesting and fun book but a bit long and a bit scattered. Stylistically it hops around a bit. At times it is funny, at times it is informative, and at times gripping, but never for long. I found it a bit tough to get through (but I do have ADD)."
1,"The original games are great, but this release is not...","While MW4 Vengeance, Black Knight and MechCommander2 are great games, I would have to advise against this repackaged product. I am not sure what Microsoft has done this time, but I've had problems with installing the MW4 and its expansion and the Mechcommander 2 will not install at all (it just hangs my PC until I end-task).I purchased Mech Collection to run on a second PC (I bought the original games for my other PC and wanted to remain ""legal""). The original disks load fine on my PCs, it's just the Mech Collection disks that experience problems.Again, I am not sure what MS has done, but this release of these games came on substandard nonfunctioning CDs. If you are interested in these games, I'd suggest purchasing the original games seperately until MS acknowledges that there is a problem."
3,Good for economists not political scientists,"This film does a good job of giving several examples of the economic ups and downs of Mexico in the 1990s. It starts out with an account of a young Middle Class couple who were hurt by the crash of 1994 and have lost most of their savings and what they hope to do to make up for the loss. Next it investigates rural village attempts by local womens groups as they hope to start small business ventures- day care centers, local vegetable stands. It then looks at the Tecnical College of Mexico City and its hope to graduate Business Majors who will help develop the economy of mexico and one young graduate who will go to work for the family toy business. Then a good coverage of the merger of PEMEX with American Oil cos. Wall Stree Journal Prod."
3,Some good tips,"PRO: There are a number of good tips in this book, even for organized types.CON: I sensed the author was striving for a minimum word count per tip. What could have been described in 5 words was often stretched to multiple paragraphs."
4,Haven't Gotten Into This Book Yet,"Read the ""table of contents"" and believe this is just the type of book I am looking for. Does seem to have some simple ways to ""de-clutter"", and appears to know what she's talking about. She has a section to cover just about every clutter issue available, and gives you ideas on how to tacklet each area. I look forward to getting into the book soon."
3,Fair,"Mathematics for the Nonmathematician is a fair read. Somehow, it feels a lot more a suitable book for anyone wishing to become a mathematician but isn't sure what it is like. There is some good stuff to learn from, and sometimes, there are worked out solutions to problems in almost every chapter. All in all, you can't go wrong with Mathematics for the Nonmathematician."
4,An Interesting Book,"As an overview and introduction to the history and conceptual development of mathematics, this is a very interesting book. As a primer for anyone seeking to learn or brush up on these principles, it falls a bit short.I enjoy the history and Mr. Kline's development of this subject but I was looking more for an instructional book that would teach me these basics as it developed the ideas and history.While it's an interesting book, it falls short as a teaching device because:1. Answers are not provided for all exercises and I had trouble confirming my understanding.2. Important theorems and axioms that should be memorized are hidden in the text and should be marked in bold or marked out by a similar method so the reader can recognize and review them more quickly."
3,Eighteen to read,"I cannot imagine why someone of Morris Kline's stature would allow a publisher to print his work in print so small that nobody but an 18-year old can see to read it. (I'm 62). It was published by Dover Books and they should know better!! Nevertheless, Dr. Kline let them get away with it and there's no chance of me selling my copy back, not with 24 copies available used. Wonder if that's because nobody can see the print? -Dr. William E. Chauncey"
3,"It's OK, but . . .","This game is good for passing time, no major strategy, just keep matching the runes. I would have enjoyed it more if I could save the parts I completed, but I figure they made this game so you would have to start all over again from each level so the game would last longer. Annoying feature."
5,Rocking Soul,"There are a lot of women making their mark in alt-rock and elsewhere but not so many worthy successors to Bonnie Raitt (not that she's through!). I think Gia might be just that, a blue-eyed soul rocker. Gia and Shannon Curfman are the class of this new generation of women artists, or at least near the top of that class. Favorite tracks on this album are Some Other Way and No Less Than Angels."
3,"Sister, what happened?","I have read all but one of Sister's mystery books. I find them light-hearted and fun reading. Also, believe it or not, the author manages to insert some theology in there too. This is something I appreciate since I am a Catholic school religion teacher. Sr. Mary Helen is a pleasant, quaint character and so is her cohort, Sr. Eileen. This book is a fun read also, but it does seem to present a prejudice against the plump. The author has definitely taken a creative leap here compared with her other books and it really did pay off. The ending is very dramatic and fresh, but the author's and, sadly, society's disdain for the hefty of humanity shines through more than was intended. C'mon Sister you can do better than that!"
3,Not one of her best,"Expecting a special treat, I set aside time to read this new (to me) book from Carol Anne O'Marie. This one had no real ""mystery"" and the Sisters fell into the solution.I usually reccommend her books to several people, instead I did to one person who, also, was not impressed. It's a shame, I am hoping that next one I try is more to the style that I've become accustomed to expect. Do NOT pick this as you first one to try."
4,Death of an Angel,"I have read a few of Sister Carol Ann O'Marie's books in the past, and I was hooked. They are quick reads that have great interesting story lines. It is on the line of a ""Murder She Wrote.This book,""Death of an Angel"" was very enjoyable. The ending was a little far fetched, but over all I enjoyed it.I want to buy all her books, I'm sure they are all enjoyable. Great for a before bedtime read or on a rainy afternoon. Tom"
2,Potential shows but this book doesn't quite meet the mark.,I think the Good Sister is a writer for sure and posessing talent. This book however is lacking while it has intriguing and suspensful places - it focuses on frankly too much on the weight of one of the prime characters and fills in the usual stereotypical view. I believe Sister will produce better work as she goes along but this isn't a book I could feel good about reccomending.
2,Is it just me or was it stupid that Eric could never die ?,"Don't get me wrong this book was ok, more like one thumb up one thumb down, but it was just that Eric Leben the bad guy of the book just could never die. I hate books (and movies) like that where the killer keeps coming back to life even after he has been shot, slautered, and in Eric's case bitten by dozens of poisonous snakes. I really liked 'The Key to Midnight' by Koontz but this one was just unreal. This book was very good until about halfway into it where Eric kept coming back to life, I mean wasn't getting hit by a garbage truck enough? This book would have been M U C H better if Eric just didn't keep coming back from the dead."
4,Too Long... but SCARY!,"OK... KOONTZ HAS WRITTEN ABOUT GENETICS BEFORE (AND CONTINUES TO DO SO...HENCE, THE CHRISTOPHER SNOW BOOKS.) BUT, I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS BOOK EVEN BETTER THAN WATCHERS (TRANSLATION...IT'S SCARIER!) Eric Leben is a truly frightening villain... he wasn't well glued together before his death and self-imposed resurrection, but he becomes (literally) a monster upon his return. The ""shadow fires"" of the book's title are psychologically chilling. Leben is definitely one of Koontz's best villains...and that says a lot. He's certainly more interesting than Candy, the vilain of The Bad Place...which nonetheless remains my fav Koontz novel. Anyway, if u are looking to get chills, th is is the book for u. Just realize the book is a bit slow in places. it definitely could've been tighter. BUT the supporting characters in this book are great... especially THE STONE and the sadistic federal agent... Sharp, i believe his name was. so pick this one up... and prepare to be spooked. :)"
4,pretty good,very awesome book i did get lost at times but very interesting and exciting to readi have to give my thanks to the author
2,Not my favorite.,"I love dean koontz books, but have discovered there was a time when his endings were lacking. I found this book to drag out and difficult for me to keep picking up in order to finish it. Overall concept, very cool, like all his books."
2,"Good premise, awful writing",An interesting premise about a man who decides to tamper with his own genetic material to cheat death was marred by subpar writing. I could definitely have done with about half of the gooey relationship between the oh-so perfect hero and heroine.
3,early Koontz novel delivers the thrills.......,"this book was a fun ride. Briefly: an obsessed genius finds the way to immortal life, but the life he finds is not human.this book involves secret corrupt federal agents, a lot of cat and mouse chases, multiple settings, and lots of action.as always, the characters Koontz creates are interesting, believable, and three dimensional. Not one of Koontz's best novels- still, it is a very good thriller.this book will remind you of the saying: ""be careful what you wish for...you just might get it.""(Incidentally, I own a first edition hardcover copy of this book that I'm selling for $100. Contact me if you want to purchase it. It is in excellent condition- good binding, no marks, or torn pages)."
3,Not one of Koontz's best,"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, and unlike some, I like his newer work better than the older stuff, like Shadowfires. Sure, there's less gruesome, gory stuff in the newer books, but thank goodness Koontz's writing skills have improved - particularly with dialogue.Don't get me wrong - Shadowfires is a good book, but it's not a GREAT book. It's very imaginative, but it's also kind of corny in places. For example, when Benny's friend, Whitney, meets Rachel for the first time in Las Vegas he says ""I've seen your picture so many times your lovely face is burned into my cerebral cortex"". Who talks like that?Still I'd rather read a mediocre Koontz book than a lot of other author's books - Koontz always offers a unique and gripping story to his readers, and Shadowfires is no exception."
2,Felt like a cheap romance novel at times,"Story was mildly interesting, but it was written in such a way that it felt like a romance novel. I didn't need to waste my time reading about the main characters feelings for one another more than once. The writer seemed to feel that he needed to repeat himself to the reader. He repeated himself about the main characters feelings, the cops feelings, character physical descriptions, etc.... I found myself skimming the book and looking forward to it finally being over with."
2,Very disappointing although it started out very well,This book lost the plot half way through. The idea was excellent and the first half of the book was very good. It seems that Mr Koontz got bored with it halfway through and couldn't find an appropriate ending. THis could have been a great book like NIGHT CHILLS!
3,"Good, but Koontz has much better.","This is an overall good book if you are a Koontz fan, but if you are looking for a book to really get a feeling of Koontz's writing, go with something else (Watchers or The House of Thunder perhaps). Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad book, but it just didn't keep me interested like his other books."
2,Boring!,"This is the 4th Koontz that I have read, and needless to say, it was really boring. It kept me interested for about a quarter of the way through it then I had to make myself finish it and then still skipped pages and still didn't miss anything! It was way too long, very disapointing. Two out of four I have liked so far. The Funhouse and The voice in the night were excellent."
4,"Hold On tight, it is A wild ride!","I am always amazed at Koontz and his ability to breathe life into his works. Please, don't compare him to King, they are not in the same league! But be sure to pick up a copy of this book for some really suspenseful moments.Check out Silent Whispers too!"
4,Sinister!,"This book is creepy, from the first chapter up to the finish!Wifey is paranoid, after death of her estranged spouse.AND she should be! Afterall, he dabbled in ""prolonging life.""The plot thickens, and the author has a fantastic imaginationin creating this humanoid-like monster thing in hot pursuit of his wife!IT gave me the creeps to think of him traveling along with her in the trunk of her (HIS) luxury car! wuahhahahahah"
2,Makes me wonder why I keep reading Koontz...,"Maybe I'm jaded, but the more of Koontz I read, the more I wonder why I keep going back for more. This book is a really good example of why: it shows Koontz's ability to take what could have been a really creepy ghost story and turn it into a government conspiracy. To top it all off, the ending was almost identical to that of ""Mr. Murder"" -- just a bit more predictable. If you'd like to see a better version of this same story, try ""Mr. Murder."" The one good thing I can say about ""Shadowfires"" is that I liked the characters...but sometimes characterization just isn't enough."
4,This one FREAKED me out!,"Its done in typical Dean style, not over the top...but a good read! And THIS ONE...Oh my! I was scared. I actually read it twice, and I usually never do that! It was just SO freeky that I wanted to be scared again. :O) Dont read it at night if youre home alone!"
2,"Ach... Dean, you've done better work.","This is a book that I started reading because I didn't happen to have any other Koontz to read (and I had already re-read Dark Rivers this month.)This book seems to have no voice other than to create tension and disgust. In the right amounts, this can be a very good thing for a horror book. This is not a horror book, this is one that through Dean Koontz' excellent descriptive language, thouroughly disgusted and scared me all the way through.The problem is that that is not what I wanted. I want suspense yes, and maybe a little disgust here and there, but this book went a little overboard for my taste.Not one I'd really reccomend."
1,Wow...such a silly read!,"I was really surprised to see a 4 star average on this novel, which I looked up out of curiosity to see how this book would be rated by the public! I came across a copy of this book at a cottage, and picked it up as an imagined ""light summer read."". Wasn't I surprised when a few chapters in, the lead character's husband returned from the dead as a wild muderous zombie! That's right folks, and later in the book he turns into a scaly lizard-type creature. Ridiculous in the extreme. So strange that none of the other reviewers even mention how odd this is. The whole book was so hilariously implausible that I read on in astonishment, waiting for a punch line. It never came. I would give it no stars if I could. Worst book ever."
5,Great Bonnie Blue Flag!,"Purchased this for the novelty and because it's such a simple, powerful looking flag. The quality is great. Can't complain"
5,Good value flag,The flag is properly priced - making it a good value. This is not a durable flag meant to withstand inclement conditions. It is a thin fabric that flies nicely in a light breeze. Looks good and this one had no manufacturing defects.
3,Hoped for More Flavor,"This is good rice, but it doesn't have much flavor. For the price, I'd hoped for a more flavorful rice. Probably won't purchase again."
2,Not worth the money,"I suppose that if you have never played Diplomacy before, this game could be a good tool for learning how to move your armies and navies, how to transport, how to support a force, etc. But that is about it. I have never seen anyone playing this version game online, even though it is available at GameSpy. You are better off playing more traditional versions of the game.I bought it in the hopes of having some decent solitaire play. If that is what you are hoping for, then forget it. The AI, even at its highest level, will not give you any sort of test. It is just about as idiotic as can be.Diplomacy is such a great game. It is a shame that its PC version is so incredibly boring and unchallenging."
3,Won't replace the standard internet game,"Anything that introduces Diplomacy to the next generation is to be welcomed, but this game is a bit week. I would suggest getting the board game instead and joining in one of the many e-mail games on line. You will enjoy it more without this interface."
1,"Just awful, a huge disappointment","Diplomacy's one of my favorite games ever, and so I bought the computer version on sight. What a bad move.First, the AI is dreadful. The computer couldn't fight its way out of a paper bag, much less take over Europe.Worse, the interface is completely unusable. The various players hurl diplomatic overtures so fast that you can't follow what's what.It's just a godawful mess. Avoid avoid avoid."
4,Not a bad first try.,"It has been a long time since anyone has put any money into Diplomacy, and I have to give Avalon Hill / Microprose / Hasbro the thumbs up for writing a pretty good game. Experienced players (who've been playing by mail and email for years) will find some of the tactics laughable - when England bounces HIMSELF out of Norway in Fall 1901 I know there's something wrong - but I still found the game very enjoyable. If this game had been released 10 years ago it would have taken the game world by storm. Unfortunately these days I think it will not be given a fair chance. If you're learning or just can't find 7 players, this is the game for you. If you've been playing for 10 years, buy it for the novelty."
4,For die hard Mandrill fans,"Having grown up as a child with the first first four classic 70's Mandrillrecords, finding this re issue was a charm. The groups transition during this period reflected a direction that would continue to gain radio attention while at the same time keeeping that traditional Wilson Brothers harmony and arrangement savoy in step. Originally issued on Arista in 1976 I personally do not recall the record company doing much advertisement for this or any of their Arista material.(I guess Barry Manilow was making so much cash for Arista during this same period that many other projects took a back burner?)The arrangements vary between the hard driving Funk of that era to latin tinged elements of Disco, die hard Mandrill fans will find this to be a very funky addition to the collection."
5,"Cynthia, NY","I recently brought the Lustrasilk Cholesterol Olive Oil from Sally's and I was little skeptical because of how cheap it is but this stuff actually works! It's not greasy & it really moisturizes my fine relaxed african american hair. I love it! I'm impressed. I usually use this with some carrot oil & leave it on overnight & in the morning my hair is soft, shiny & deeply moisturzied! Great product, I will continue usuing this."
1,really bad secondary ingredients,"I thought this product only contained the docusate sodium, and when I viewed the ingredients this was all that came up. Unfortunately the inactive ingredients contain red dyes (not good for your health), propylene glycol (better know as de icing fluid), polyethlene glygol and other chemicals. Not a healthy way to soften stool. You may get rid of the poop but get cancer or something else as a side effect... do not recommend this."
5,GREAT socks,"I would buy these more often if they wore out faster. They are warm, comfortable, durable. I use them for work and casual, but not for hiking/skiing. In winter (Maine) I wear them inside Keen's sandals except during actual storms and find them plenty warm.The usual reason I buy more is that one of my kids has visited and appropriated my socks..."
2,Meh,Thinner than expected and stretched out more than most Smartwool socks upon wearing. They're fine. Not perfect. And not the same quality as the other socks I've purchased.
2,A little disappointed,"I have bought smart wool socks before and they were great. the mid-hikers did me right and latest like 8 years. I bought the street hikers because I moved to the city and walk a lot, but I am disappointed with the te feel of the socks and that they do not stay up on my calf and they continually sag into my shoe. This never happened with my mid-hikers."
2,Manufacturing defect,Socks seem very nice but I immediately noticed that the sole had a silver dollar sized section of pulled and frayed threads just forward of the heel. I could have worn them but was afraid that the defective section would quickly turn into a hole. These are very expensive socks so I will return them for a replacement pair.
3,Not bad for the live song and the video,"Title track needs no introduction, and fans would be well aware of the video.The live version of judith whilst good is a carbon copy of the studio version, no added extras or 'power' from it being live, good but nothing exciting.The biggest letdown was the del naja remix. Long, drawn out and you would expect some sort of trip hop spin on 3 libras but it is just slow and long winded, worth one listen only."
4,Live At the Gaslight,"Some good, very very early Dylan, a mix of age-old songs (Barbara Allen, Cocaine, Handsome Molly) and new (for the time, anyway) Dylan material (Hard Rain, Don't Think Twice, Rocks And Gravel John Brown). This was way back in his protest period, so it's only natural that the two best performances (Hard Rain, John Brown) were both protest songs with very vivid imagery. I'd say the version of Hard Rain is better than even the studio original! Of course, I also like Don't Think Twice, though in this case perfer the classic original. The only weak song is Barbara Allen, it drags on way too long (even for Dylan) and the story is awful."
5,great reference book!,"This is one of the more detailed books I have found. I also got Health for Happy Cats and Your Cat by Elizabeth Hodgkins. This one has a lot of details about what to feed, how to feed it, what the diseases are and what the treatments are. You can look it up by both disease and symptom and treatment, which is fantastic. They discuss pros and cons of various things. They also have a good section on cooking natural diet versus raw natural diet. They are more advocates of cooked diet as far as I can tell. They also have a few diets. If you are going to get one book on natural health for cats this should be it. there is a lot of information on supplements."
3,Good tips.,"I like the book...but I wouldnt buy it again. I feel like the ""medicines"" that they suggest are usually very expensive and hard to find."
4,Great book,"It's awesome book,pragmatic with comparative issue with human perform of almost supplements. Just I didn't like it hasn't references acutely and in index hemerography or bibliography, only told about a study x or you. I loved it in T Murray books."
5,Excellent reference for Dogs and Cats,"I can recommend this book to anyone that wants to improve the health of their dog or cat. I have a special needs dog and I needed information on the proper supplements and food to feed him.This book is an EXCELLENT source for that information and so much more. It provided me with one source for information and helped me make decisions on supplements and food I should use.The title says it all. It really is the ""Natural Health Bible"" for dog and cat care. When I need more information, this is the first book I refer to. Every page is well written and complete.Each topic is easy to understand and easy to follow. If you are looking for a natural approach for your pets healthcare, you should add this book to your library. Youll be happy you did."
2,Too Much Information for Me,"This book has lots of information, but it's not what I was looking for. I'm looking for ideas to supplement my pets' raw diets. This book tells you how to treat all kinks of diseases with vitamins and herbs. It covers all kinds of diseases, like Degenerative Myelopathy and Feline Infectious Peritonitis. I trust my vet pretty much when my pets are sick, even though I know vets don't know everything. The book does say you should always consult a vet who uses natural methods, but my vet uses conventional treatments, so the book really doesn't apply to me."
5,The tightest and most energized flatpicking jam album.,"This album is by far my favorite of all the albums I have heard that could fit into the bluegrass/slamgrass/dawg/flatpicking/acoustic jamming genre. Dan is definitely at his best on this album, and he shows off all of his amazing speed and clarity at flatpicking, cross-picking and kicking out those unique Dan Crary licks. But don't be deceived, this album is not just about guitar - almost every track lets Bela Fleck, Sam Bush, Mark O'Connor and others get their licks in too. From Crary's incredible ""Memories Of Mozart"", a thoroughly jammed out flatpicking version of a classical piece, to the best rendition of ""Foggy Mountain Special"" I've ever heard, this album could definitely be described as completely energized and just plain invigorating to listen to. I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates the finest acoustic musical talent."
1,mechwarrior 3,"I started playing this games years ago. I had to stop when I upgaded my computer brcause it would no longer run. there doesn't seem to be any patches out for it. when I saw it on amazon deceided to try it again, still no patches don't waste your time or agravation on it."
3,Mech 3 not an XP or vista game,"if you have an older computer, a windows 98 or NT then this software might still work properly. If you have an XP machine I had difficulty running it and even keeping it going on my machine. I did not even try my vista machine. the graphic generators in the program maybe too slow to properly initialize this game. I really don't know. I do know that it has crashed a lot on my XP machine. It also needs to be run through DOS. This game would be excellent if updated for use in the more modern windows programs but the original company that put this out is gone and with no updates this is a shame."
2,A fun shoot'm up.,"A fun shoot 'm up, no less, and regrettably, no more. Fans of the board game, the series, or even the role- playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment. The game has few options besides ""click and shoot"". Still, I spent a fun few hrs playing it (and a lotta dlrs buying it).I hope we'll get a better, more extensive version soon."
3,Good game - Bad seller,I played this game in the past and it is fun. Seller sold me a defective game though and it randomly shuts down during game play.
5,This game is the bomb-digity,"I love to play this game, it's never boring.Everyone should play this game!The weapons are awsome , the mechs are awsome (the thor and dashi in particular. I love to customize the Dashi with nothing but weapons. Buy this game today!"
4,Great game,Great game. good controls. hours of fun. one thing that i didnt like was that is was hard some times to finish a missions you got to make sure you do all them and the sub-missions. i would leave before i got the submissions done some times cause the screen would come up and say you completed your main objectives then i would leave. that is my only complaint about the game other than that is was one of the best games that i have ever played.
4,Common sense book,"This book has a lot of common sense ideas, most easy to follow, when hiring a contractor. In some cases I could see that following all the advice might cause some contractors to run away and play with somebody who is not a pain in the ***, but the advice is to protect the homeowner and is written in such a way as to be easy to understand. The book lacks a summary of the ideas, which I condensed into 2 pages for our project"
4,A hit for a 5 year old,"This Emperor Penguin Puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old. We almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal. This penguin looks round and pregnant, but to my kid, this penguin is a perfect friend. He has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys, but for some reason, this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination."
3,Arctic - Antarctic,"Difficult to assess what kids make of it but yes, these things probably add to bringing nature, of which the kids themselves are part, closer to them. They also perpetuate the myth that wild animals are nice and cuddly. I would take issue with the editorial review which calls the penguin an ""eye-catching Arctic artifact"" - penguins would surely be eyecatchers in the Arctic, as they are Antarctic (or at least souther hemisphere) creatures. Not much educational value has rubbed off on the editor.... sorry!"
4,Great light!,Great seller and light. One of the glass sconces were broken upon delivery and the seller quickly sent a new one to replace it. It looks great!
4,"Fascinating example essays, Advice from admission directors","I find the previous review disturbing. It is obviously the editor or author of the book giving themselves kudos.I liked the book. It made me realize that the personal statement should not only be a self-marketting piece, but also be entertaining enough as to not get sorted into the circular file."
3,Good not great.. but real example,"The title said so. This is the guide for writing statement. Unlike other books, this book won't show the typical format. This book, however, shows the ""real"" statement of applicant who success. Many examples are interesting. Moreover, the guideline of recommend letter request is very good. It's not only for people who ask letter of recommendation, but also for the recommendation letter writter can see what they should said to thier students. I disagree with other reviewer that this book is not limited only Law, Business, and Medical school. It's true that the title said it and the examples are to Law, Business and Medical school. However, if you read it carefully, many examples and guidelines can be used in other school as well. This book is well written and organized. However, due to limited resource, example and guideline, this book is only in 3 stars."
5,When is the next pot luck?,"What a perfect item for pot lucks, especially when used on picnics. No refrigerator - no sweat. Great idea."
1,Not A Good Experience.....,"I ordered a New Black Pyrex Portable 7 piece set. A dirty, used Blue set arrived with crusted food on it. There were 5 pieces missing and the pieces that came were scratched, used and nasty. The box had been glued shut by someone. I will stick to Books when it comes to ordering from Amazon in the future."
1,Check if it's compatable with Windows XP,This unit will not work with windows XP and it's hard to find any updates on polaroid Web Site
2,Not worth the money,"I am searching for something positive to say about this camera, but I am at a loss for words. Negative things, however, are no problem. In short, the shutter lag is ridiculously long, the picture quality is only fair, the 4mb card only holds 6 pictures at the highest quality, the memory card is almost impossible to remove without strong fingernails or plyers, and the software is inferior to adobe. A friend has a kodak DC215 and it is a much better camera than this one. I returned mine and am going to buy the fuji finepix1400 or the kodak. Consumer reports didn't have much good to say about the poloroid, but liked the fuji and kodak. I must say I totally agree with them."
2,Not worth the money- better to get a kadak dc215 or fuji,"One good thing about this camera ( and the only good thing!) is that it is easy to operate. The software is easy also, but inferior to photodeluxe, which is offered with many other cameras. One of the major bad points of this camera are that the printed picture quality is bad. A friend has a kodak dc215 and I printed a picture taken with my camera next to one taken with his and the kodak was much better. The other negative thing about this camera is that it takes the picture about 3 seconds after pressing the button. I would expect some delay, but this camera is ridiculous! So my advice: get a kodak dc215 or fujifilm finepix 1400. I'm returning my polaroid as I write this."
2,Not the greatest..,I bought this cause I needed something fast and didn't want to spend a lot of money. The unit ok ok. It eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best. I should have ponied up the cash for a better camera.
3,good picts. bad software,"right out of the box the camera was simple and easy to use. the software is a different story.,it would not recognize camera on either serial or usb connection, polaroid was no help.I now have camera produced by kodak that works better than than the pdc1100."
4,Super easy to use!,"I've had this camera for over a year now and it just works great. It's simple and easy to use. I use it mostly to capture my young son's growth progress to share with family and friends. We just got back from Hawaii last week and used the digital camera more than my regular camera. You can see the results right away and delete the ones that did not turn out. It's also easy to use for downloading pictures on to the web. The only downfall is that it doesn't have a zoom capability; but, I'm perfectly content. Have recommended to family and friends who are not web savvy. Thanks."
2,Nice camera if you like lemons.,"This was a great camera for the whole two weeks it worked. I had similiar problems as the previous reviewer - flaky performance, full batteries not recognized, etc. Since this is the second faulty Polaroid 1100 camera that I have received, I am not giving it another chance. If you are willing to risk it, this is a good entry-level camera. The resolution is great and it is very easy to use."
4,Review for Polaroid PDC-1100,"A megapixel camera with USB connection for [this price]!(after rebate) I was sold! The USB connection is lightning fast compared to other digital cameras. serial connection. My only gripe is the color quality isn't always that great, but overall the camera is a must buy, especially for web designers!"
4,Inexperienced Digital User,"This is my first camera, so I have no basis for comparison. But I do like it and believe that it is a great deal ($ wise). As yet I am wondering if the digital zoom isn't wasted capacity. It would appear that the photo editor is capable of cropping the picture. There is no help in the manual for attaching photos to email. A frustrating omission, when this was my principal reason for buying. I was able to work through this, however, by reading the FAQ's on Polaroids web site. My compliments to Polaroid for being the only source, that I could find, for not trying to ""Rip off"" their customers by withholding the AC adapter until the user is forced to purchase it at an extravagant price."
1,Don't waste your time on this camera!,"I reviewed this camera previously when I first purchased it. I had to send the first camera back as it had a bad adapter. I was also disqusted to realize that it is not compatible with windows ME. So, after getting a second camera sent to me with a new adapter, and after getting software to support windows me, now my computer will not recognize my connection to the camera...bad connection cords?! I am tired of wasting my time and energy trying to get this camera to work for me. It is not worth the money (even on sale). Buy a better camera...and don't buy a Polaroid as their customer service is non-existent!"
3,Good For Casual Fun,"Alot of the reviews for this camera compare it's quality to those other newer cameras. Of course this camera is going to be a little less quality... it's 1.2MP!! duh.Bottom line, this camera's main downside is it's battery consumption. Get some rechargables and problem solved. When you print out photos on standard size photo paper, the prints don't look too bad. Thus this camera is good for going to the beach, having fun around the house, etc. If you're looking to do more serious photography, pay more and get a higher megapixel. But this one will do for casual stuff."
3,Polaroid PhotoMAX PDC1300-a relative?,"I tried to find reviews of the 1300. Is it an older version of the 1100? Has anybody heard of it and used it? If so what did you think of it? Please write me at my email address. So far, it seems to work well."
2,Windows Me Warning,"After reading the review already posted about customer service saying the product isn't compatible with windows Me, I decided to check it out before buying. I called Polaroids service number, (no, they don't have an email address), and talked to a young lady. I told her I was considering a PDC 1100 but had read that it was not compatible with Me. Before she responded I said I couldn't believe that was true since every computer for sale this christmas is shipping with Me. (consumer non-mac that is) She then told me something interesting, that this camera IS compatible with windows Me, but that they don't offer tech support for it. Huh......... Sounds fishy to me. She also said they don't offer tech support for windows Me on ANY of their cameras. Olympus, here I come."
3,Same as HP photosmart 215??,"This camera looks identical to the HP photosmart 215, and even the specs are the same. This is a decent low end digital camera. Don't expect the batteries to last more than 10 or 15 pictures unless you're using the lithium batteries.Picture quality is good, but again, don't expect professional quality from this camera. You'll miss most candid shots because this camera takes awhile to focus.You'll love this camera if it's your first digital and your don't expect too much. If you're a professional or aspiring photographer, buy a different camera."
4,no more film developing,this camera is really nice. not all that heavy and very eazy to use. it is so kool 2 show pple the pic you just took. it eats batteries like crazy though. the energizer titanium works the best and lasts up to 4 uses of the camera. the software is eazy and friendly to use and the price is very nice.
5,"The best of times, the worst of times....","Funny, scary, and everything good about Steve Niles and Cal Mcdonaldm even the author's commentary and the intro was funny and interesting, and that's saying a lot because, who EVER reads those?The illustrations though, they could use more definition. Sometimes it was hard to understand what was going on because some of the pictures were either not clearly defined enough or too small, like the Producers told Steven and Ben to shorten the book and make the illustrations smaller. That's kindof what it seems like.Well, Steve, Ben, GREAT BOOK!!! BUT COULD YOU TWEAK THE ILLUSTRATIONS A BIT PLEASE?"
3,"Interesting horror book, but art inadequate","If you like zombie/supernatural type themes, the story is interesting enough. However, the art is inadequate. I don't expect fantastic ""top shelf"" art from a book like this -- but if some panels are so blurry and poorly defined as to be nearly worthless, what's the use? I would rather have crisper black and white art (ala ""Walking Dead"") than poor color art."
1,Derivative,I liked this story when it was done on the old Kolchak the Night Stalker series.Unfortunately the book is just very ordinary and is NOT scary. AVOID!
3,The reading is not very accurate.,The reading is not very accurate. The temperature measured is 0.5 to 1.5 degree lower than actual.
2,cute but chinsy,"So I absolutely adore the way this watch looks. Its so cute and stylish. But my mind changed when I got it in the mail. The band was super short and it would only fit on the last ridge. It was very cheaply made and poor quality. I couldn't imagine this watch could stand through much. It just felt chinsy and fragile. I returned it because it was tight and uncomfortable. I don't even have a big wrist, between 6 & 3/4 inches and 7 inches. I was really sad because it was so beautiful. Let's face it, this watch was only made for looks. But I didn't want to pay $80 for a super small crappy watch that doesn't fit. I expected more, this watch retails at $250!! what a rip off! I love you Gwen, but make better watches!"
3,"Bad printing, awkward writing, important content","The Fellows of Harvard University should be ashamed of the quality of the printing in this book. Not only is the print small, often the print is light and the letters are speckled with white. I also agree that the writing style is bad even by academic standards. You really have to read each chapter twice. Now, having said that; it is very interesting and a good anecdote to the notion that the French notion of Reason is the dominating idea of the Enlightenment. For an easier read or an introduction read Himmelfarb's The Roads to Modernity.The Roads to Modernity: The British, French, and American EnlightenmentsEconomic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment"
2,Interesting but Frustrating,"The subject is interesting. Putting Adam Smith in a historical context can reveal much about what he really wanted to say. But Emma Rothschild's writing style is frustrating. Time and again I would read a sentence and then ask ""what did she just say?"" and realize that it was a banal generality or that she could have expressed herself more directly. I studied history when in college and have read many well written books on intellectual history. Rothchild's book isn't one of them."
1,Disappointed,"As a NW side Chicago girl I was excited to read this book. What a waste of my time and money. I still have not finished it, but I know this is a book going nowhere. The book is terribly repetitive, poorly written and glorifies low level street violence. Yes, its tough being the white kids in an urban landscape, but have you learned anything? What is obvious is the writter is still glamorizing the old days. I can imagine him, PBR or Old Mil in hand waxing prophetic about his days as a white gang-banger. I like to be a solution to a problem, not contribute to it."
5,Excellent Depiction of Reality in a Chicago Street Gang,"This book is a page turner, so I hope you have a lot of time on your hands when you read it. A person would either have to have had experience with the different gangs in Chicago, and the People/Folk Alliance, or show an honest interest in the Greaser lifestyle to comprehend all that Rocker and Co. has been through.The people giving the book bad reviews are reading too much into it......""The Catcher in the Rye"" was poorly written, yet it is a classic of American literature. ""The Lords of Lawndale"" may too see it's recognition one day, as a tale of the hardships faced by many young people growing up in neighbohoods that we drastically changing from one culture to another."
3,not so great,"Too many typos - I've never seen so many typos in one book!!! The story was the same throughout - gang fight - gang fight - they didn't really go into the mindset or anything else aside from a chronology of fight after fight. The book just kind of fell flat. Once a King Always a King was extremely well written, but Lords of Lawndale was really lacking. It had the potential to be a really good book if modified."
4,Societies guide to true neighborhood life.,"I found the book very compelling, considering I am a suburban male. The media and white society tend to ignore the fact that many white people are dying on the streets everyday. This book is a true account of the way political powers in Chicago have catered to the gentrification process. It is unfourtunate that between crooked police, and the infiltration of drugs that people of the Lawndale Nieghborhood couldn't live a peaceful life. I strongly reccomend this book, as it will open alot of doors for people that believed that gangs in the city were only built of minorities and drug dealers. Michael Scott does not claim to be a hero, but In my eyes he is a survivor of curcumstance, and I truly enjoyed reliving his experiences."
4,Worth a look at while keeping a few things in mind,"What? Four stars? Is this guy crazy?Probably.But still, I think this is an interesting read, if you keep in mind that this is not, and does not have much a connection to, the 616 universe (main marvel universe). I agree that this is a more realistic view at Tony Stark and Rhodes. Yes, its gruesome, yes, there is nudity. However, its MAX and that's one of the reasons you are here reading about it! For the right price its a good book, and don't let the black and white pages turn you off (right away at least)."
3,"Interesting mature look at Iron Man, but loses steam","This Marvel MAX title attempts to take a mature, more realistic look at the Iron Man mythos, and it does a solid job, but it never quite picks up the steam it seems to build. Writer/artist Chuck Austen's script makes Tony Stark look like the alcoholic, eccentric, money hungry, ego maniac that he would be if he existed in the real world; as we see his technological breakthrough get used and abused by the highest bidder. Austen's dialogue is average at best, and he has flashes of brilliance here and there, but for the many who love to criticize him (and there are plenty, yet this guy continues to write major titles including X-Men, Action Comics, Avengers, and JLA; go figure) will find plenty to pick apart, including his computer assisted artwork presented here in black & white. Filled with intriguing ideas, U.S. War Machine is worth checking out for Iron Man fans, but there are better titles available in Marvel's MAX line."
3,THAT HIGH LONESOME SOUND INCARNATE,"MORNING GLORY is a thoroughly enjoyable album of varied song genres sung by Chris, with his smooth as velvet voice, with a mostly bluegrass backing instrumentation. It's a cousin to DESERT ROSE, but that was an album with a more rock 'n roll backup band. Herb Pederson, Hillman's longtime singing partner, provides the glorious high harmonies. These two wonderful singers sound like they were meant to sing together. Like Don & Phil, like Gram & EmmyLou, like George & Tammy, Tim & Mollie...Normally, I would've awarded this release 4 stars, however, it is very short time-wise, thus the deduction. The label should have combined MORNING GLORY with DESERT ROSE as a twofer. At least, that's what I would have done, but I'm not a record label exec."
3,Small Factory - For if you cannot fly review,"Very strange recordHi Howard I'm Back is a great track, followed by SensibleIts ok but those are the two tracks I tend to play the most. From what I understand this was the bands last album"
4,Folkmanis Ladybug,"I'm pleased with my ladybug; it's cute and not too big, not too small. It slips onto the finger well...and it looks good just sitting on a flat surface too, so it's good for using during a storytime or just being a part of a collection."
5,FINALLY ON CD,"I enjoyed this work on vinyl when it first was released, and it still holds up after all these years. There are areas of this lengthy and experimental work that sound like his work with 'The Camera Club'/'Buggles'. Fans of 'The Art of Noise' and 'Yes' - during the Trevor Horn years - will hear similarities as well. Still a treat to listen to."
4,Not one of my favorites....,"The book may appeal to someone with cheap tastes but for me to many of the examples were cluttered and to 'cute'. Or maybe I was simply looking for a book that had more style, or a book that would be more California or NYC friendly.The initial photographs on each new chapter pages whet my appetite and made me assume that what would follow would be more of the same, but alas I would turn the page and be met with more cheap style ideas, if one can even use the word style. The books cover suggests a book that has style and a zen mode, but is far from either for me. The majority of rooms in the photographs in the book are more cluttered and cute."
3,This was an exciting book!,I'd like to tell you two reasons why I like this book. First it was exciting but realistic. It had girls just like me. The setting was during World War II and I like learning about this war. I enjoyed this book. I would recomend this book to 4th and 5th graders.
5,THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!! IT CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!,"This is the most amazing product i have ever laid my hands on. Not only does it save all you Playstation games, but it looks like everybodys hero GOLDBERG!!! I know after using it for a while now that it will always have a place in my heart and my psx. I cant believe the quality of products coming out these days, and the Interact Goldberg PSX memory card is of no exception. BUY ONE TODAY IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER"
5,Very entertaining & educational,"I was never a history buff in school, but this series did make it interesting to see 'what might really go on' between the White House staff & the first families over the years. All Star cast. Well done."
5,"Yeah!!! After looking for 25 years, I've got it on order!!","I saw this mini-series as a teenager and was facinated by it. It is clearly one of my favorite movies. I found a copy recently that someone had taped off of TV when it aired on NBC and was reminded of what a great historical treasure it was. But the quality of the 25 year old VHS tape was so poor that I am very greatful that the mini-series is coming out on DVD. Miss Cole and Miss Uggams give wonderful performances as Maggie and Lillian Rogers, mother and daughter who worked in the white house during the first half of the 20th century."
4,Backstairs at the White House,"Excellent insight into the workings of the White House from the staff's point of view. Not quite as long as the original TV version, but still well done."
5,Great Fun Watching History,"My husband and I had seen Backstairs at the Whitehouse on TV as a mini-series years ago, and had always wanted to see it again. When I saw it on amazon.com I immediately ordered it. Because it's several hours in length, we watched one DVD each night, and couldn't wait to start the next DVD the following evening. It's a great production filled with so much history. We love movies based on true stories, and this is a super one! Thanks for the smiles!"
5,Great Historical Miniseries,"I watched this mini-series when it orignally aired in 1979 when I was 10 years old. It aired over serveral weeks and my family would gather around the TV to watch it. I have been talking about this series since I was ten and have been dying to see again. I cannot tell you how excited I was to see that it had been released on DVD. The minute that I discovered it, I placed my order. It is a great piece of history, with a great cast and I urge everyone to see it."
5,History Buffs,"I remember watching this when it first came out and kept thinking they would rerun it? I never saw it again on TV, I was so glad when I saw it was available on Amazon. This is for anyone whoever wanted to see what its like to see how it was back in the good ""ol"" days of our White House. Buy this, you won't regret it!"
5,Fantastic!,"Backstairs at the White House was incredibly enjoyable. The acting was spot-on and the story lines very interesting. The one thing I was surprised about was that details were not presented of FDR's untimely death. As he had formed a special relationship with Lillian, and Eleanor with the staff in general, I was expecting to see their sadness.I laughed. I cried. I will definitely watch this mini-series over and over again, as well as share it with friends and family.I will say, it depicted quite well the change in the attitude of our society in general when it showed that a once united in friendship staff was now aloof from one another and the family they served. A sad statement, indeed.Highly recommend this as a family viewing - multiple times."
4,Black History Month,"I saw this television mini series in 1979 and I was just as excited watching it today, it's a keeper."
5,One of the greatest mini series,"Backstairs at the White House is another great miniseries that ever graced the television screen. Olivia Cole and Leslie Uggams did a superb job as mother and daughter maids in the White House. Cloris Leachman was so good as Head Housekeeper, Mrs. Jaffray. Always enjoyed watching Leslie Nielson and he was great as Head Usher. Great cast, superb acting, costumes, and you can tell that they got along fine working together. I will never, ever let anyone get this DVD set from me to borrow...LOL."
5,Imagination that blows you away,"Thomas Ades will easily outlast his detractors tiresome cliches about the ""emperor having no clothes."" This guy has dazzling wardrobes of every color you could possibly imagine. His symphonic Asyla is a real masterpiece of our time, not just the boring game of playing it safe for timid audiences, nor the heavy cerebral games of composers who've lost touch...Ades has an imagination that's totally riveting, and he knows how to keep the listener following him down the pathways and dark alleys where it leads. This is also, by the way, truly virtuoso playing by the orchestra and smaller ensembles. IT will leave your head spinning and giddy."
5,Fantastic sander!,"I am a cabinetmaker/finish carpenter and this handy 1"" sander has appeared more than a few job sites, but the price of this little sander has kept me away from purchasing it for years. Finally I bought one specifically for sanding window stools to match bull nose corners and it worked great. To my surprise, I found it was the best tool in my arsenal for doing so much more. From scribing to fine detail sanding. I am amazed at how often I use it. Wish I had bought it a long time ago"
4,Several nice scarves....,"HOOKED ON CROCHET includes many nifty projects, including a beautiful striped scarf and a granny square scarf both of which I have made or am in the process of making. I made the striped scarf in shades of purple, mauve, and lavender for my 12-year old granddaughter and she loved it. Now I'm making another one for me.Another scarf featured in this book is constructed of a single color (lime cotton) with detail provided by the contrasting pattern created by alternating rows of single, half-double and double crochet stitches.The book also includes the ususal impractical items like a crocheted skirt (even if you line them they sag) and a teeney-weeney bikini (the bottom will also sag and may come off in the pool if you aren't careful).Jensen's book includes a nice discussion on hooks and yarn types the crocheter will find useful, as well as some basic stitch instructions and a brief digression in an appendix on 'instructions for lefties'."
1,He's not just a Star Wars Star!,"I read this book in anticipation of knowing more about this outstanding actor. The author talked only about SW, and briefly talked about his best film to date, ""Life As A House"". This is a serious actor, no matter what people think about his performance in Star Wars. I don't reccomend this book. You will find a much better bio of him online. Check out his fan bases."
5,For foodies.,"There are few music CDs that my kids like to listen to from beginning to end, and which I, the driver, enjoy as well. We love food and cooking, and this CD makes us hungry just listening to it. It is fun! Quality song writing and singing."
1,Horrible,"Taco Grande is not an original song. In fact it was written by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic way back in 1992. He is not credited and I believe is not even aware of this track being distributed and he HAS been notified, hopefully he will take legal action. I don't know how many more songs are stolen on this album but just go out and buy the Weird Al Yankovic food album if you want an excellent version of Taco grande."
4,Good Northwest blues,A good blues recording from this Northwest Blues band. Don't know anything about the band but they sure sound good. Excellent guitar work. A solid disc that swings. Buy it.
2,no information in book,This book has very little information in it. It doesn't tell the reader anything. At least it does have pictures.
1,The Worst,"This book was disjointed, unorganized, and boring. I felt as though I were reading the notes an author makes before writing a book rather than the book itself."
3,So so,"I'm not sure what possessed me to order a thermometer online instead of heading to the local pharmacy. I was lazy, I guess. I am a nurse and use a thermometer many times daily. The numbers on this one are a bit small for my liking, and wish it was back lit in some way or illuminated. Also, the beep is VERY quiet. Sometimes it takes a lot longer than 10 seconds. On the good side, it seems to be comfortable and light weight so it's easy for patients to keep it in place. It also seems to give accurate readings."
4,Just Shy of Perfect,I like the fact that one can easily change to use degrees Centigrade and the flexible tip. Readings are fast and accurate. The instructions are comprehensive and clear.The only thing that is negative is the beeping when highest temperature is reached. The unit beeps so softly that you can very easily miss it.
1,A Thermometer for the younger generation,"Only good thing I have to say about this thermometer is that it works. It does not work in 10 seconds like it proclaims, it is at least 30 seconds before you get an accurate reading. I need my glasses and a well lit room to see the read out accurately. The beeping sound, I think the other reviews were being polite saying it was faint. You must take the thermometer out of your mouth and put it to your ear with the rest of the room silent to hear any beeping at all. The tip is very flexible and does appear to be water proof. I have owned a lot better seven dollar thermometers in my days. I would not recommend this product to anyone over 30 whose eye sight and hearing are starting to go."
3,"Cheap, but gets the job done","I paid less than $10 for these (shipping included). When they arrived I found that the hinge was broken. They still function for welding, but I can't flip it. They are not very comfortable either. Next time I'll spend a few more dollars for a better pair."
5,Great Goggles for steampunking,"All around great goggles, whether for steampunk costuming or welding. Either way they're comfortable and worth the purchase."
3,"Uncomfortable, but cheap","I haven't used these for welding, but they seem like they would be fine.They do not feel durable. The strap snapped on me only wearing them a couple times.The lenses are pretty dark and seem like the same shade on my dad's welding mask.The edges of the goggles dig in and are uncomfortable.The Clear lenses have a slight curve and distort my vision.I used them for a costume and to have around if I ever need some cheap eye protection, but if you're going to use them frequently get something more comfortable.Pros:-Price-Good for a quick costume or minor usesCons:-Not durable-Very uncomfortable-Clear lenses distort vision"
1,cheap,These are not welding goggles.They are for a cutting torch I had to wear darkdark tinted sunglasses to use them then I just got a sun burn on my face buy a full face trust me
2,Poor quality,"Dropp these ""toy"" glasses once and the flip part popped off and wouldn't go back on.Would not recommend or buy again even tho they are cheapYou expect them to last longer than 15 minutes."
3,"Goggles aren't blue, they're green.","I ordered these goggles specifically because I needed blue ones. While the picture looks blue the ones I got in the mail were hunter green. They also weren't shaped like this as the nose is shorter and the tips on the welding part of the goggles are round instead of angled.Had I not needed things to be specific to the picture I probably would have been happy with this product. As it stands, however, they're completely useless and I'm off on my hunt again."
3,Pay close attention to the color,"Beware! The showcase pictures led me to believe these goggles were blue, but that's only reflected light. The PVC frame is actually a dark green with a hint of teal. Very nice color, but not what I was expecting. (I'm putting together a costume that's predominately blue and thought these would enhance it; I bought theseHobart 770096 Welding Oxy-Acetylene - 50mm Eye Cupgoggles a few months ago and will use those again instead.) They also don't lay like normal glasses, wanting instead to roll onto the lenses when they're placed on a flat surface. They're not as easy to see out of as the Hobart goggles either, clear and dark lenses both.For the price, I will probably keep them; the flip feature is nice and there's definite modding potential. But I believe the pictures are a tiny bit deceptive and that there are better goggles out there."
4,Mad scientist again...,Another Dr. Horrible fan and the perfect goggles for the look. Comfortable to wear too.
1,Hard plastic and unknown shade number at purchase.,"I purchased these goggles for oxy/acl cutting thinking it was around a shade 5 and a comfortable fit. When I received them the first thing I did was put them on and noticed that the plastic was so hard and the edges were so sharp that when it touches your nose it hurts. Also it didn't fit snugly to my face no matter how tight I made it. After some slight modifications to make the nose area more comfortable I went to cut some steal. Well that's when I finally figured out what shade it was, must be a 10-11. I couldn't see anything. So overall I got what I paid for. If I would have just went to harbor freight I would gHave seen the same pos's and never have got them. Happy buying y'all."
3,Glasses have poor optics,"First, I liked the low price and the fact that the dark lenses ""flip"" out of the way but that is all good I can say.The clear lens has numbers and letters stamped on them that really get in the way of my vision. These ""distortions are in the lower part of the lens, just where it is critical for close vision (15"" - 20""). The plastic looks and feels cheap.I am not returning them as my daughter would like them for a steampunk costume she wears. If the intention for these goggles is as a stage prop, then they are OK, but not for actual work."
2,Caveat emptor,"I purchased this enclosure because it was one of the few to include a fan, but the airflow is so low as to not provide any substantive cooling, and since the enclosure is plastic, there is little thermal coupling , as there would be with a metal enclosure. The included instructions claims only support for 300GB, but I was able to get a 400GB drive working. Instructions neglected to mention the drive MUST be jumpered for MASTER - Cable Select causes non-detection of the device under Windows XP pro. Plenty of screws PLUS screwdriver provided with product."
2,Buyer beware,"...if youre thinking of buying this record because of the Billie Holiday or Be Good Tanyas references. Sure, this album is kinda jazzy, but you'd be hard-pressed to draw any real comparisons to Billie Holiday beyond that. And yes, Jolie Holland was briefly a Tanya but the Be Good's *perfect* style of old-timey soul/folk is absent here. Instead you get spooky-sounding minimalism and half-baked compositions that manage to sound both consciously irritating and carelessly aloof at the same time. Also Jolie works a little too hard at unnaturally chewing her syllables, and it gets annoying pretty quickly. This album might yet grow on me, but if you're looking for the melodical sweetness and charm of the Be Goods or Billie, dont waste your money."
2,Indie Girl Imitates Billie Holiday Imitating a Hillbilly,"I'm not sure what the young lady is trying to accomplish here...potentially compelling folk-blues material collapses under the weight of annoying , exaggerated Appalachian vocal affectations (""Give me that ol'-fashion mor-phyne...it's good enough for mae""). Guess I should have taken heed from her similarly afflicted turns on the Be Good Tanyas' Blue Horse (""Riiine and snow...""). As a counterpoint I contrast her with Gillian Welch, who manages to stay on the good side of the line separating authenticity from irony. It's a shame, thinking about what might have been if she would drop the pretensions and just...sing."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Lucinda Williams and Cowboy Junkies, so my friends thought I would dig Jodie. Wrong. I found her lyrics boring and her delivery annoyingly pretentious. Not to my taste at all."
1,To each his own,I found this CD to be tiresome and monotonous. It went into the trash after one listen.
5,Sweet Jolie- The Queen of em All,"I'm not objective- Jolie Holland and her music make me crazy. I don't think of Escondida as a cd that I listen to, I think of it as a place that I go and that I need. I think there are people who get religion and can't get enough of it- they've felt the holy spirit roll down their spine and out their toes and now- nothing else will do. That's how I feel about Jolie. Before her I was a skeptic, but honest to god I've been converted and now I'm a mystic."
2,stop the worldhopping please!,"Like most, I really enjoyed the first book, The Meq. However, I've been able to finish only half of Time Dancers. I'm frustrated with three things: Cash drops in historical facts to the point of absurdity, as the professional reviewer shared above; he has characters inexplicably ""go away,"" alienating a reader who likes said character; and through all the country-hopping it's hard to keep sight of the original goal. Even the threat of the Fleur-du-Mal is not enough at this point.What I liked about The Meq was the fact we were experiencing it through a newcomer's (Z) eyes; but here, Z is a little older, a little more wise, and there are parts where I find it difficult to sympathize with him.What Steve Cash is doing in three books could possibly be done in two.I want to like this book and will probably go back to it soon. I am planning to read the 3rd book to see how it all wraps up. However, I find this installment a little too frustrating."
2,not as good as the first book,"I loved the first book about the Meg, couldn't put it down once I started it. This book is easy to put down. The characters seem to spend years running around the globe chasing the evil Meg, when they find him they stand there while he does his evil deed and then runs off again. Seems to be filling a space between the first book and a third book."
4,So much detail,"Some of the rules wording requires more than a once-over to grasp the implications, but this is the most detailed martial arts system I have seen to date in a d20 based roleplaying game. Attacks are broken up into zones (headbutts, punches, and kicks) and you get special abilities in those zones depending on what combat style you choose with your feats. You can get special ""finishing"" moves, such as elbow drops that deal large ammounts of damage when the opponent is prone. Over all, it allows for a complex and detailed hand-to-hand combat system that i would suggest for anyone who liked monks in DnD but found them bland. This system is best suited for d20 modern though for making martial-themed adventures."
4,My daughter LOVES it!!!,"We bought this for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas. She loves dolphins and I thought she needed one to play with. She has slept with it every single night since. She loves it. It is a perfect size for cuddling. She can put her hand in it like a puppet to make it swim or talk, or carry her beanie baby sized dolphin baby around. This is more money than I would normally spend on a stuffed animal, but it is totally worth it when is is something they love and use regularly. It is nice quality as well."
2,Been there done that,"I bought this DVD hoping for instruction in advanced belly dancing--it plays more like a fitness program. I don't want a fitness program. I want to learn advanced belly dance movements or routines to help me with fresh ideas. I would consider myself borderline intermediate, but the material in this video would suggest I'm beyond that--This, in my opinion, isn't a belly dance video. So where the ""Ultimate Bellydance"" comes from is lost on me. Sadie's dancing lacks the soul of the dance. It's more like watching a gymnast perform. One should incorporate one's own interpretation of the moves into the dance mode, but new or different ideas would have been nice. Maybe ""ultimate"" here is referencing ""the last"" as opposed to the ""optimum"", so to speak. It's the last I'll watch of Sadie's instruction!"
5,very helpful & practical,"I purchased 23 acres of worn out farmland that I wanted to make into a productive forest. Most of the books I found discussed things from a commerical/industrial scale, and seemed to discourage innovation and experimentation. Mr. Morsbach's book discusses the experiences of someone who has 'been and done' over the last thirty years, with notable sucesses and honest appraisal of failures & setbacks. I especially like how he shows how 'experts' can have different opinions and even be quite wrong! His ideas about mixing species and direct seeding are very interesting, and have changed my approach to planting. I would certainly advise anyone who is planning to raise trees and is interested in woodland stewardship."
4,Very good book,"This book was excellent and contained alot of common sense advice. I only deducted a star because it was more applicable to the East Coast, while I live on the West. Really good material, and I liked its balanced approach to the use of ""non-Green"" methods."
2,It's OK,There are currently only two recordings of King Roger (my favourite opera) worth considering. The Birmingham/Rattle on EMI and the Polish National Opera/Kaspszyk on CD ACCORD. Wojtek Drabowicz is far better as King Roger than Thomas Hampson. Olga Pasiecznik as Roxana sings with less vibrato than Szmytka. The Polish recording also has far more presence than the EMI recording.If you like King Roger you will probably like La Fiamma by Respighi.
4,Overall great product,"as an FYI: I bought this thinking it was a USB headset, and it turns out yes you do plug it into the USB port (for power only), but you also have to plug it into your soundcards output and mic in to get sound/use the mic. I was trying to avoid this since I still wanted to use my regular computer speakers without crawling behind the pc and switching plugs... but that is exactly what I'm having to do.Pros:sound qualitymic works great, and clearcons:if used for hours at a time they make my ears hurt"
2,Very heavy,"I'm a bit disappointed -- perhaps it was me for not doing enough research, but these headphones are HEAVY. I feel like I've strapped a couple of speakers to my ears.The sound quality is fine, and I can't give it a one-star because of that, but for a gaming headset, these are entirely too heavy. I'll be looking to replace these as soon as possible."
2,Headsets don't last - unsatisfactory return/replacement policy,"We bought 2 headsets, one was faulty after only 4 months. Exchange policy unsatisfactory at only 90 days."
2,Mic bad and headphones uncomfortable,"Mic pick up is horrible, the worse I have found to date. It doesn't reach the mouth area and the pick up just doesn't work with its positioning.Also, The headphones sit on the ears poorly, and cause aches after 2+ hours. The are balanced to put the weight of the headphones on your ears.Overall, not worth the money unless you have a small (smaller than hat size 6 5/8) head. And for the price, Plantronics are MUCH superior headsets. Go buy a pair of those."
4,"Overall Experience is Great... Sound Quality, Not so Great","They are built to last don't get me wrong. The sound quality is just not as good as IceMat, but the durability is better in my opinion.A thing you may want to consider, though, is that it does not allow you to adjust them to fit your head; and so, let me clarify, I don't have the biggest head and I certainty don't have the smallest head, but I know that I don't have a normal sized head either. In other words, smaller than normal sized head. They fit, but if my head was any bigger, they might have a tough time."
5,Best headset value - you should buy!,"The headset itself is sturdy and very comfortable. There is a lot of padding and it's adjustable in a number of ways. The sound is excellent, on par with some very expensive headsets I've tried. What really sets this set apart is the force feedback feature. if you're into gaming, you MUST try this. You really feel the explosions and little details of the game like footsteps in another room. It even helped my gameplay because i could hear enemies better.The mic is good quality, I use it with Teamspeak and everyone says they hear me loud and clear.Highly recommended! You won't be disappointed."
2,Not Impressed,"I was so not impressed by these. This sound is below average unless it is heavy bass music... and the computer is turned up to maximum volume. They are heavy and uncomfortable, sound is horrible unless you don't want to hear anything around you... waste of money completely. I ended up giving them away after about one month, when I had enough money to buy new headphones."
3,$40 bucks for a few months.,"For me the headset was ok, it lasted about 5 months. Its not too comfortable for people with larger heads and the ears have a tendency to snap off fairly easily. This is my second headset like this."
2,Hrmmmmm,"Hard to make up my mind on these things. Its like I dont really love em but I didnt pay much for them so I cant complain.Pros - Comfortable, decent sound for the price, flashy lights...,Cons - No mic mute button, mic to far from mouth, flashy lights..., vibration thing is pretty lame but can be turned off, small static sound issue.Overall I wish I woulda bought some other head phones."
4,Decent for gaming,"These phones are nice and comfortable, and don't sound real bad for gaming, but they certainly do not compare with Audio Technica or any other dedicated music headphones. Very bass-heavy sound, and while good for gaming, misses high frequencies in music.But not a big deal! That's why I have the ATs. :)Picks up a lot of line noise when the vibrate feature is turned on, but it does add a nice effect when gaming and shooting stuff. Would have liked a mute button in-line, but that's a small consideration.Bought a refurb set for $19.99, but it appeared that they had run out of refurbs or something and shipped me a factory-sealed new set. Works nicely.(I see one set listed new for $129.99. If you pay that, you ARE getting RIPPED OFF. This is a $40 gaming headset, nothing more.)"
3,Looks can be decieving,"looking for a headset that can be used both digitaly (usb) and opticaly (3.5mm jack). however while this headset displays both of those ports, the digital port (usb) is only for recharging the headset. THIS HEADSET WILL NOT WORK ON A PS3. as a ps3 requires a digital headset that transmits via a usb or bluetooth. after buyiing this and looking for ways around the problem (converters, external soundcards ect..) i found that none of those solutions would work for the ps3 becuse you cant instal external sound cards, and converters can only convert 1 jack. meaning no mic. aka, this set would only work on a pc. or mabey a phone. oh and i never tested the vibrate function. in never seemed compatable with my psp games, or computer games. cosy, good sound. the mic isn't bad for the price."
5,Really beautiful and brings back memories,I really enjoy this song Eres Tu. It is always my favourite song since I was a small kid way back in the 1970's. Really wonderful piece; a real masterpiece I should say. Makes me want to cry over and over again. Really love it; great song for all to listen.
1,Eres tu ... an even better recording,"I agree with other reviewers, Eres Tu is a great song from the '70s that I recall from the Eurovision Song Contest.Eydie Gorme's version is good. However for the definitive of the song try Mocedades's version. Absolutely brilliant!The live recording found on ""Mocedades, 20 De Coleccion"" is crisp and memorable.The CD is available on Sony LATIN CDL81123/2 461504HAVE FUNRoger Osborne, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England"
2,sadly generic,This CD lacks any type of grit and personality. It's a cd full of happy pop sounding songs from a guy who pretends to be a country singer by wearing a cowboy hat.
1,disappointed,"I was hoping to read more about why Walker Lindh committed the acts he did, but without a firsthand account, learning his beliefs was not possible.Also, the author should have tried to weave in the political dynamic of the world into the story instead of treating Walker Lindh as an isolated person."
3,Could be better,"I'm a home/hobby woodworker and I found this sander to be a bit much for me. It seems more suitable for a larger shop. I'd rather have had a quarter sheet palm type sander for finish work of the size I do.The dust shroud made it difficult to get up against inside corners and the sheet clips are cumbersome and poorly placed, as you have to trim about 1/8"" off the half sheet to get it to sit snugly.The dust collection worked well."
2,Good news: $699.00.....Bad news: very so-so picture,"I had this TV for 1 week in my basement family room and was pretty disappointed, even with a HD picture. You really get what you pay for with this TV. I couldnt stand it anymore and found a 32"" Phillips HD LCD for about the same price on sale. HUGE difference !!!! Luckily, they returned the Vizio for my full purchase price. Honestly, only buy this TV if you absolutely only have 699.00 to spend. And dont compare the picture to other name brand LCD's. You'll regret your purchase."
1,Lot of problems with this TV,"I bought this TV three months ago; it worked fine as long as it was connected to a DVD player only. Once I got Comcast HD and plugged it into the TV- strange things started to happen. Ten/fifteen minutes after starting the TV - it would switch itself off - then on again - off again. It was very irritating and you have no control over it.I experienced the same problem even when I was trying to play DVD.Some of the HD channels still ran in 4:3 screen and left two big black bars on the sides - the zoom feature did not work for these channels. But sometimes it automatically fits the full screen. The picture quality was good (while it worked), but this model seems to have a lot of technical problems. Costco was too nice to take it back and give me a full refund."
3,good product fo the price,"I have had the product for 2 months and so far so good, aside from an audio glitch. The audio signal seems to freak out now and then but I did not intend on using that as I have plugged audio signal directly from the cable box into the audio receiver. The analog video picture does require some fine-tuning, as the picture is a bit bright out of the box. To avoid the fine-tuning watch all your video through my HDMI hook up. That makes a considerable difference (plasma like). Then the color reproduction is superb and there are no issues of the screen being a little bright. Bottom line is it a good value and if you are into the performance of your equipment then do the HDMI and with the money you saved by a home theater system. I did (Yamaha 360). I am happy with my purchase. oh and by the way there tech support is abouve normal."
1,Buyer beware,"I owned my Vizio for just over a year, then it died. It would cost more to get repaired than buy a new one. I contacted Vizio to see if they could help me in any way, but they were most unhelpful.I was very impressed with the price of my Vizio when I bought it and by the picture quality. But beware most of the good reviews for Vizio on the internet are from people who have only had there TV for 2 or 3 months. Once they have had there TV for over a year they will realise why it was so cheap."
1,It lasted 3 weeks,"I bought this TV at Costco. After 2 weeks it started randomly shutting itself off. It got more and more frequent, and by week 3 it would no longer turn on at all. Needless to say, I returned it."
1,Don't expect it to last,For the price I was happy with the TV for a little over a year. After the warranty was up all of a sudden the High Definition turned green while the AV inputs worked normally. The problem is that you can't find a repair show to work on Vizio TV's. I called dozens of shops and only one said they could get parts to Vizio's but advised me to throw away the TV and buy another brand.Vizio tech support was not helpful in directing me to a repair place so I finally gave up. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand.
1,Terrible TV,"First of all, the remote never worked since I bought this tv. If I press channel up or down, something else will happen, for example. After only a year, it would not turn on. Luckily I had gotten a warranty through Sam's Club. However, it took 2.5 months for them to service it and return it to me!! They refused to give me a new tv or pay for my cable bill while I was waiting. It finally turns on, though they did not do anything with the remote. I dare send it back again. I will never buy anything from this brand or Sam's Club again. Buyer beware"
1,Worst company EVER!!! DOnt BUY IT!!!,"I bought this TV expecting something good according to the reviews. Instead I received a deffective television that could not Be returned!! AMAZON wouldn't help me! and Vizio just screwed us! First we attempted to have them replace the TV, instead they sent us one that was WORSE!! If you can avoid doin business with this company DO IT!! DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM! In Fact, make sure Amazon is willing to help you with any product you buy from them because they tend to wash their hands when it comes to products like these! If its a LEMON AMAZON DOESNT CARE!! WATCH WHAT YOU BUY!BTW, I gave this product one star simply because AMAZON doesn't offer none."
1,Fraudulent Claims,This TV will not receive HD signals because it does not have an ATSC tuner. It only has a NTSC tuner to receive regular analog TV. This TV is sold under false pretenses and the company should take all of them off the market instead of dumping them on unsuspecting uninformed customers like me. I will never buy anything from these crooks again!
1,Worked great for first 2 years,"The T.V. was fine for the last two years, it is in the bedroom and doesn't see that much service. This morning I went to turn it on and nothing happened. The little amber light is on, so it looks like its getting some power. Checking the web I find this is a common problem with Vizio. So it looks like the main board is bad and it'll cost at least $150 for the part and hopefully it fixes the problem and I don't do any additional damage when I swap it out - lol. Some people were taking it to the shop and getting quotes of $400. I have never had a new T.V. go out this soon. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE !!!!!!"
3,Screen Blacks Out,"I have had the L32 for less than one year. All of a sudden,the screen started blacking out, then it would come backon. At first, it would happen only once during a 2 hourwatch, now it is blacking out every 5 minutes, Viziohas promised to send out a repairman. I like the TV andhope this is an unusual case. Update...Vizio had a Tech.replace a ckt board....TV now works fine."
1,Customer service very bad,The VIZIO HDTV stopped working and I waited three months for someone to call me to repair it. Meanwhile they sent me emails that I should wait and be patient. The phone number for cutomer service is not toll free and you wait on the line so much to talk to someone.I returned it to the store.
2,Problem out of the box,"We bought this tv at Sam's Club for 699.99. We loved the picture on it in Sams and some of the salespeople recommended it over some other tv's that we were looking at. However, the SAME DAY we hooked it up, we had problems with it. When you turn it on, the sound would come on, but no picture. It was not an issue of ""tubes heating up"" because I left it on a good 2 minutes once to see if it would come on. Turning it off and back on usually fixes it, but not always. After a while, we just boxed it up and took it back to Sam's, who took it back and refunded us in full. We bought a different HDTV from a different manufacturer; if Vizio makes TV's with such a simple problem, then I do not have much faith in them. Sam's has an excellent return policy on TV's. It's pretty much unconditional and has no time limit."
4,In defense of Vizio,"We bought a smaller one (13""?) from Costco about a year ago and really like it. We have had no trouble, and move it to face either the kitchen or dining room table when we want to watch it. You can't see it well from above or below, but if you tilt it (which is easy for this size) it has an excellent picture. We're thinking of getting a larger one and so am looking on ths site for references such as I've seen here. Will have to read more to get a good feel, but I wanted to defend Vizio since we think what we got was great for the price."
1,Poor Customer Service is ZERO STARS,"Don't buy anything Vizio.I bought the 37"" version of this thing. It comes with a 1 year warranty. The Panel (picture Tube) failed 5 weeks after the warranty was up. Vizio makes no replacement part and claims it is so expensive you would buy a new one in stead anyway. I talked to as high a level manager (national director of customer non-service)as they would connect me to asking for some consideration on a $750 HDTV they now say is junk in less than 14 months. Their answer: ""that's not our policy"", go buy a new one. Well I did, a Sony."
2,Good While it Lasted,I owned this tv for about three years and it worked perfectly. Then one night while watching it the tv popped and fire and smoke came out from the back. It just shorted out.
1,Vizio not worth the $$,"I could not resist buying an 32-inch LCD Flat-Panel for $600 on sale. However, for some reason on a music channel the sound would go in and out. Before it went out, it would make a clicking noise. A Vizio repairman came and replaced the motherboard. This did not correct the problem. Instead, a different problem emerged. In addition to the old sound problem, now when the TV turns on, it is automatically muted.??? Have tried to get back in touch with Vizio customer service but have been given the run around. No one in the company seems to be able to connect us to the right customer service dept and then when we called the dept, no one returned the message we left. Trust me it's not worth the hassle. Just pay the extra $200 for a better brand and be able to sit down and enjoy your TV in peace."
1,Expensive Piece of Junk,"My mother has had this TV for a little less than 2 years. A thoughtful neighbor bought it for her after my father died. Recently the picture contrast has gone all red and the TV is impossible to watch. TV repair technician said this TV is not reliable and they see problems with this brand all the time that are more expensive to fix than the TV is worth. A TV at any price should last a good long time. I will replace my mom's TV, but with any brand but Vizio. I will never buy a Vizio product at any price."
3,Fun C.D. for kids,"This C.D. is a cute one to add to a silly mix/collection. I can't say that I am overly impressed with it, however, we (the kids & I) do boggie to some of the songs. I think I can deal with it for another few months... :-)"
5,show your kids you can be a fun parent too!,"My kids love this CD, it's a really fun collection of songs that you'll be tapping your foot to even when the music has stopped. Our boys, aged under 10, love to jump around to this music and sing, having this CD during fun time at the house really helps to connect you and your kids and show them that you can listen to their music too, and enjoy it!RECOMMENDED!"
2,one song,I got this for one song and wish I hadn't. I could have gotten it through iTunes and payed way less for the one song I actually cared about.
2,Flimsy,POOR QUALITY PLASTIC PHONE. NOT WORTH TO BUY. REQUIRES AC CONNECTION TO OPERATE THE CALLER ID.
3,cheap flag,"The flag was cheaply made, but I only paid a few dollars for it, so I can't complain too much."
1,Never received item,Bought this for my husband who was deployed in Afghanistan. All his roommates were rep'ing their state he wanted to too. I sent many off care packages and orders from amazon this was the only one that didn't make it.
4,So much fun!,I have had this game before and I had a blast with it. My kids rolled over it and broke the cd. Had to replace it. I love this game. THE ONLY THING IS you have to manually put money in and that takes a lot of time. Otherwise awesome game.
3,casino 101,"I though this game was to childish and was not very fun, but if you are big fan of monoply then this would be for you."
2,Great for wireless email - sllloooooow connections,"...That said it does work - except in my office! And I don't work in a protected building - I have to go up to the roof to get a connection. I have tried it over the last week while travelling in Houston, Phoenix, LA and Las Vegas. Worked fine on the road which is the main reason I got it. The email connection is painfully slow - it reminds me of computers from the 80's and the bitty modems. Painfully slow. Attachment downloads are just not worth the wait and many times just failed. Better to embed the document as text in the email. Wireless email is what makes this usefull for me so for that one reason it was worth the expense."
2,shoddy,"I suppose this might be a cool device if it actually functioned properly. Almost from the second I unwrapped it there were problems - it freezes every other day. I don't know how much data I've lost cumulatively. I don't even want a replacement, I want a different model. I'll even take a ""lesser"" model. If Palm support fails me (which I hear is likely) I'm going back to handspring."
1,This is an unreliable piece of equipment.,"My Palm i705 works fine when it is operational. But it has crashed twice. The good news is that the company is very good about sending a replacement, and honors the warranty. The bad news is that it is a gigantic pain in the neck to have an unreliable PDA. It is disruptive, and take a lot of time to order the replacement and activate it.Is it just a coincidence that I got two lemons in a row? Of course, I don't know, but I'd be careful."
3,Good book for reluctant readers,"As a middle school teacher, I selected this book for my more *reluctant* male readers. The characters and their struggles seem real, and teenage boys could identify with Cameron. The author also treats Cameron's abuse in a manner that can be digested by young readers - it is apparent that bad things have happened to Cameron, but nothing is explicitly depicted.In a market floodly by teen fiction primarily geared toward young girls, most of the offerings for young men are sports related or special interest. *Counterfeit Son* is that rare exception that appeals to young male readers without the heavy sports emphasis. 95% of the guys like it, from the football team to the marching band."
1,Too obvious..,"This book was very predictable and boring to read. There was not enough action in this book from what I expected from reading the prologue of this book. I was very disappointed at the dullness of this book, and of the evident clues to the ending of the story. Opposed to the first impression of this book, it is an awfully tedious and predictable book. Nothing in this book enthralled me or kept my attention to read, except to find the extremely obvious clues that the author leaves for the readers to find. I would not recommend this book to anyone but for those individuals that enjoy short and easy reading."
5,my workouts are so much better and more interesting now,"good workouts. you can mix it up quite a bit. the text size is big enough for my aging eyes. you do have to set out to dry, but otherwise, I highly recommend for those trying to get a good workout in on their own."
3,Fair: Price/Quality.,"i take my brother's account but my review is:this product is good for smooth and straigth hair woman, is good to take out not so pronunced waves in the hair, like made for pig tales, ribbons or hair clips. not recommendable for curle hair or thick hair. anyway it work for me but i did not recommend it to anyone unless you have a straight hair and you just want to take off little waves."
1,Piece of junk.,"This straightener is a piece of junk. I needed a new straightener after my old one was no good anymore. I was a little strapped for cash at the moment and wanted something write away, so I went to Target and bought this remington. You can't tell from the box or in a picture how cheap it is, but it is all plastic-y. I thought it looked nice, kind of fancy, and it said there was a warranty, so I figured hell, it has a warranty so it's probably decent right? WRONG. Yes, this does get your hair straight pretty well, but it rips your hair out from the roots while it's doing it. There are little spots on both sides of the plates that rip your hair out, and it hurts! Not worth a day of straight hair. I'd go for something with a better design. If you've got the money for a better quality flat iron then do it, if not, there are much better low price alternatives to this piece of garbage."
1,Terrible Vendor,"We never actually used this item. Bought it cuz of recommendation from a friend. The vendor sent us a used product in a broken box. Item is good for the price. If you are willing to spend more, there is a much better product out there, they retains the heat and cuts time to 10 minutes for long hair"
5,I love it,"Beautiful, This is a good cd for teaching and performing tai chi, also good for yoga, qi gong or just relaxing.I think you will like it."
1,We sent this back,"We have tied this swaddle, the ""swaddleme"" and the Amazing Miracle Blanket.We have twins (boy and girl) and not only did this swaddle not keep them secure, but we awoke to find the swaddle part wrapped around their necks - not good.Do yourself a favour and get the miracle blanket, it is the best of the 3."
3,Not much new here.,"There is not a whole lot new here, and Nash's argument about the ""unknown"" revolution gets a bit tiresome. If one has read nothing about the American Rev., this may be a good start partic if one wants to avoid the top down, Founding Fathers approach. However, Nash gets a bunch of details just plain wrong (odd, since he is a very successful textbook writer), especially regarding military history."
3,wash it away,"Too many characters with too many problems. Like another reviewer mentioned, I was confused as to who had what problem because there was too much going on.I wanted so bad to really enjoy the book but I couldn't. The premise seemed like a fun story. I was very excited to read it but then I started and it dragged. Characters weren't developed and Susan's problems with her husband seemed to be added at the last minute for character development that never happened."
2,Not very engaging,"I found the premise of the novel very interesting, but Carroll just tried to tell too many stories in this book. I felt like I didn't really get to know the main character, so when her life started to fall apart, I didn't really care."
2,Dull and unengaging!,"Leslie Carroll's ""Spin Doctor"" revolved aroud Susan, a therapist, who gave free counselling sessions to the tenants of her apartment building. The counselling sessions were held in the laundry room of the building where Susan's ""patients"" were more comfortable to share their problems while at the same time, doing their laundry. Even though Susan seemed to be able to her the tenants, she was unable to solve the problems in her life. Her relationship with her husband seemed stagnant, and her daughter, Molly seemed doomed for a career at McDonald's.I didn't enjoy this book at all as the author provided many stories which was a bit confusing as I cannot remember who has what problems. The storyline in general was weak and not very engaging. The main character, Susan, was not well-developed and the supporting characters were not very interesting either. This was a rather weak chick-lit book. Nothing worth wasting your money."
2,Not exactly what I expected....,"This book could have been better if the author had given more depth to the characters... If the book was a bit longer I think it could have been a great one.... However, it is too short and does not allow the characters to blossom..."
3,"Good Read, Slow Going","I decided to read the book because it was free. I thought the plot was decent. The characters names were a bit hard to follow. The romance was a little odd, although I did like the playfulness between Raun and Bree. Overall, I rated the book 3. I would read more of the authors books."
3,"A good read, but the heroine gets annoying","Elena & Symon are good characters and interesting to read about. Symon is especially intriguing as a clan leader who must fight madness to lead his people. Along comes the healer Elena, whom he wants to heal him and more. Her inability to trust Symon when he is so obviously trustworthy grates after a while. Most of the emotional power of the book comes from Symon as well. Even so, emotional power is not one of Ms. Wittig's strong suits. The villain's motives are not made clear enough early on to make the most of his character, and the majority of the secondary characters are flat or undifferentiated. As a result, the book doesn't quite fulfill it's promise. It is, nevertheless, an enjoyable read--just nothing to write home about."
3,Too much telling instead of showing,"An intriguing plot about a healer (our heroine) in medieval Scotland who discovers the real cause of the curse suffered by Devil of Kilmartin (our hero). There are bright touches--many secondary characters glow with charm and interest--Murdoch, the Devil's loyal henchman, and little Fia. However, the characters are overwhelmed by the author's push to advance the plot by telling us what they think and by filling in gaps with explanations. The book would have been richer and more intriguing if the reader could have seen and heard the characters instead of the author."
4,Great read!,"I wasn't too sure about this book at first, but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Am looking forward to reading her other novels."
5,A Story of Scotland,"I enjoyed this book - really found the book easy to read, well written and a great retreat to the stories of Castles and the olden days"
4,the verve ep is a must have for the verve fans,"If you like the laid-back, atmospheric grooves of A Storm in Heaven, this EP is for you. Although there aren't any real rockers on this cd, fans of The Verve's more subdued early efforts will find this release is every bit as good as the band's best work. Granted, the studio version of Gravity Grave (the album's first track) is not as sonically powerful as the live version that appears on the No Come Down EP, but, instead the focus shifts more towards the atmospheres,bass grooves, and Ashcroft's elemental delivery than raw power. An excellent cd."
1,Horrible!,"I can't believe they can get away with saying ""B or lower""... most are for ""B or higher""! What a waste of money!"
1,Just Flat Out Horrible,This horrible book does not have enough scholarships that are community or that are not restricted to certain colleges. This book has too many scholarships for certain schools and doesnt focus on a wide variety of colleges. There is an overwhelming amount of scholarships for Clemson University and California Polytechnic University. Nobody should waste their money on this useless piece of parchment.
1,Don't buy,Don't buy this book. Most of the scholarships are for people with a GPA over 3.0 and most are for certian schools. There are better books out there
2,disapointed,i wasnt prepared for one song thought it was the whole album sellers please give better product descriptions we pay good money for theses items
3,I read it for the sex scenes with Jamie. They were intense.,Isn't it every married person's fantasy to have two spouses and not feel guilty about it? Great concept. The Scottish highland atmosphere makes me want to visit. I am a fourth Scott or so and never thought much of it until I read this book. All I want to know is where I might find the magic stones so that I may have Claire's adventures too. Especially if there will be a stud like Jamie waiting for me. Don't tell my husband.
3,Too complicated.,I thought the book had too many characters and unlikely scenarios. Probably won't read another one. The first one I read was better. It was Outlander.
2,Boring,"Boring, but could be interesting to some history buffs - if the history is accurate. Never did finish it. Dissappointed, only purchased it because the first novel ended with a cliff hanger. Now I don't care what happens."
1,Plot discrepancies Noted by a Nitpicker,"Overall, I like the book. I was concerned to see that one reader, who said he was a real highlander, found it to be unauthentic. However, for my own part, I was struck by a couple of discrepancies in the beginning of the book. Namely, Claire breaks a couple of crystal glasses belonging to one of the leading male characters (I forget his name) and nothing is said about the financial loss to the character. Crystal is expensive, yet he seems not the least concerned -- nor is she. He only obesesses about the question in his mind as to whether she did it deliberately or by accident. Apparently all the characters must be independently wealthy, since Claire also engages this man to do some time-consuming historical research for her, and no one bothers their head about any monetary compensation for his efforts. True, he is crazy about Claire's daughter, but still you would think the question of money would at least be mentioned."
4,Dragonfly in Amber,"It has been a year since I read the first book in the series, so I was worried about ""catching up"". Gabaldon does an excellent job of moving you from the first episode to the next. I am not a romance novel buff and tried her first book on the reccomendation of a friend. It starts well and keeps your interest to the end. I found myself putting myself in the heroine's place and wondering just what I would do. Also the idea of changing the past and just maybe not interfering with the future is a thought to work on. A thought. ""How many people have vanished through time warps among old ruins?"""
4,What a great sequel to Outlander,This book picks up where Outlander left off and travels from Paris and back to Scotland while Jamie and Claire keep having somewhat insane adventures in their quest to stop Charles Stuart from unmitigated disaster. The book is highly entertaining and full of twists and turns that you don't see coming. I loved the book and will definitely continue reading the Outlander series! The only thing wrong with it is that its a little hard to keep with with which character is which because there are just so many. But that's what the Outlandish Companion is good for.
5,Best story ever continued!,"The first book in this series is Outlander, which was my favorite, but really they are all wonderful. The narrator of these stories, Davina Porter, is phenomenal. She tells the story and you are on the edge of your seat the whole time!"
2,Disappointing after the first book,"I was rather bummed that this book began in ""present time."" It gave too much away right from the beginning. Hence, while reading the rest of the story we already knew several things that would occur. Had the book began where the first left off, the book would have been much more suspenseful & entertaining."
4,Not as good as OUTLANDER,"This book was quite good....very well-written and emotionally engaging. However, it was not nearly as good as its phenomenal predecessor, Outlander. The first part of the book which took place in France was, quite frankly, not very interesting. However, once Jamie and Claire went to Scotland(where they belong, IMHO), the action did pick up. I also thought that a lot of unnecessary and rather stupid things happened to Jamie and Claire. (Ex: Claire was forced to have sex with Louis, King of France!....PUH-LEEZE!) I didn't like the parts of the book with Roger and Brianna, who are,IMO, very dull, flat characters. D. in Amber was still a good read, though, certainly many times better than a majority of the books out there, romance or otherwise."
2,Not as good as first book,Book ambles on and on without getting to the point. I only ordered because of the sneak preview and its not in this book. I will not continue with the series.
4,Good book but not a quick read,"I read the first book, Outlander, quickly and really enjoyed it so I had to get the second, Dragonfly in Amber. The continuation of the story is good but it's a little unbelievable at some points with the twisting story line. However, saying that, I'm now reading the third book, Voyager, and am enjoying it immensely."
3,THIS WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FOLLOW,"I tried a few years ago to read Outlander but couldn't get into it. I started again a copule of months ago and loved it. But Dragonfly In Amber was harder. I bogged down a lot more with the detail of the battles, who was against who, who was pretending to be against who, etc. I tended to get confused. Not saying this is the author's fault! But I did find this more difficult to get through. But I LOVE Claire, especially Jamie. Who wouldn't want a man so devoted!?!"
3,"Dragged and dragged, ye ken.","Outlander was an exceptional book. It was exciting, sad and sweet all at once. The idea to write such a book was phenomonal. The author is very good which is why I was excited to read the 2nd installment. I have to say I was sorely disappointed. The book was quite tedious to say the least. It could have been much shorter and would've been a great read. I got to the middle of the book and I skimmed the rest. I hated to do it but I just couldn't take it anymore.There was just too much time spent on mundane things. It had the habit of getting exciting and then it would get drawn out. There just wasn't even of a storyline to keep the battle from happening.I will give the third a try because like I said, Diana G. is a very good writer. I hope the next is better."
4,A Fantastic Story of Romance woven in history,"A friend gave this book to read. Four hours later I was still reading the book. I finished it over the next several days and I thought it was just a wonderful story. I understand that Dragon Fly is the second book in a series, so I won't hesitate to order the first book Outlander. Ms. Gabaldon is such a gifted writer that knows how to weave a story with history, romance and intrigue. I just love this novel and would recommend it to all my friends."
5,dragonfly in amber,"fantastic enjoyed every page would have liked to have read it in one sitting, but daily routine kept interrupting, it was a pain!"
5,Starting to read it now...,Just starting to read this one now and it is interesting and cannot wait to find time between the Holidays to finish it.
4,Excellent Historical background,"I thoroughly enjoy learning things about historical Scotland, and this is definately the series to do it with. If I may say one thing however Diana, and that is everytime I come across a swear word in your book (which isn't very often, but the ones you pick are ""the worst""), I am completely thrown for a loop. I am not a purist by any means, however, I wish you would use language that wasn't so harsh and detracts my attention from the story. Thanks for a good read!!! Monica Fast"
2,A Pale Follow-up,"This book was a pale follow-up to the compelling ""Outlander"". Way too wordy, the editors could've easily shaved off 100 pages by taking out repetative or unnecessary descriptions (note to author: sometimes less is more). The main characters are just as engaging as in the first novel, but what really seemed to bother me was that nearly all of the secondary characters were described using variations of ""plump"", ""round"", etc, etc. Does the author really beleive that she needs to make her main characters that much more attractive by surrounding them with larger people? I found this quite offensive. The vast majority of the book is predictable and drags along at much too slow a pace. The saving grace was the short third act of the book wherein they return to Scotland and the action picks up. All in all though, I was very disappointed."
5,Incredible,"This second book in the series was even better than the first! I read it even faster, it's a great follow-up to ""Outlander"". With time travel, romance, adventure, and historical fiction all wrapped up in one, what could be better than that!"
5,Dragonfly in Amber-another fascinating part of the Outlander series,"Diana Gabaldon has continued the fascinating story of Claire's journey through the stones back 300 years into the 1700's in Scotland where she marries Jamie, the Scottish Highlander. This part of the series also takes them into France where they try to discourage Bonnie Prince Charlie from trying to take back the throne. The history is enjoyable and there is plenty of adventure and suspense."
5,review,"i LOVE this series,iread all of these books and am now getting them on my kindle and re-reading.Diana Gabaldon is the best writer ever! I have always had a hard time reading,it takes me forever to finish a book.With this series it's easy I never want to put it down. Yes the books are long and it taks awile because of that but they are just that good. I Love historical novels and these have all that with rich charaters that pull you right in the story. i've been through all books in the series and can't wait till the new one comes out this year(2013).Hope they make these into movies"
3,dragonfly in amber,"I received the book in a timely manner. The hardback was yellowed, the paper binding was tattered. yes the book could be read but i would have hoped it would have been in better shape. thanks"
3,dragonfly in amber,"This light, charming, historical romantic fantasy is the second book in the ""outlander"" series. The story of Claire and Jamie evolves as they continue their lives in France before returning to Scotland. The book is entertaining and for the most part historically accurate. It moves along rather slowly at times and tends to be somewhat descriptively repetitive during the intimate moments between Jamie and Claire."
3,Shorter would have been better,"I thought it drags on a bit. The general story line is very interesting and I'll read the next book to see how it ends, but I really wish more had been cut out."
5,oh my word,"I love these books so much. This one does not disappoint. Diana Gabaldon weaves an extraordinary tale that is addicting. I actually just finished the last book in the series, and restarted them again. Currently re-reading this book. So good!"
2,"While I loved the book, the audio version was disappointing","There are so many backup characters , such as Master Raymond, and Mother Hildegard, that have been deleted in the audio version. These characters not only add richness to the initial book, but they are fairly important to the development of the later books! I know being ""abridged"" means editing some out, but I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I bought the cd because I wanted to experience the books in a new way; that is, hearing the accents, instead of just imagining them. Also, the majority of love scenes have been deleted as well. I'd have thought that they could leave in bits and pieces without snipping the entire sections! I love these books, but I won't buy the rest of the cd's!"
2,Things that make you go hmmmm...,"I just couldn't get into this book. I skimmed alot and still felt like I got the gist of the story. It could have been so much better....IF IT WASN'T SOOO LONG! Good grief, how many descriptions of shoes or flies or whatever is completely irrevelent to the story do we need? Claire is a ""healer"" but she pretty much dismisses the rape of a friend as something the girl just needs to snap out of??? Any WHY did it take 2-3 days to get to the castle from the stones the first few trips but the last trip took just a few hours? I can't figure Jamie out either....he cries constantly and doesn't seem to mind people knowing he was raped. I just don't think that is the way things were back then. And if I here one more ""story"" of how his loving father bent him over the fence and thrashed him I am going to be verra, verra sick, you ken? Don't think I can handle anymore of these books or I may find my own circle of stones so I can bash my head against them......"
4,JAMIE IS HOT!,"Once again I was taken back with Jamie and his adventures with Clair that were filled with their unbelievable romance that is beyond time. I found that it was once again beautifully written and found it hard to put down. I am now on the third and can't wait to read on of their timeless love. I think this book was good but not as good as the first one, but the incorperation of new characters was well done, even if I didn't care for the return of some.... *hint hint* READ! It is worth it."
5,Dragonfly in Amber,Continued the saga of Jamie and Claire. I didn't want to put it down until it was finished. Thank goodness there is another one to follow.
5,The 2nd BEST book I ever Read!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dragon Fly In Amber is the second book in a series of four books (so far). If you you enjoy history, romance, mystery, intrigue, and Scotland then you will love these books! Start with the first book Outlander,#2- Dragonfly in Amber,#3- Voyager, &#4- Drums of Autumn."
5,One of the best historical fiction reads ever!!!,I happened to pick up this book at the airport. My flight was only 1 1/2 hours long then I had to drive an hour to get home. Six hours later I had read half of this book. When I finished two days later I ordered the next two books immediately. I have finished Voyager and am in the middle of Drums of Autumn. It is the best realistic-romantic-escapist novel I have ever read!! Diana Gabaldon is truly a great storyteller!! I hope that there is more to come!!
5,Lovely. It grabs you right away and keeps you there.,"Voyager, the first of Gabaldoon's triology (series?), kept me wrapped for a week. I passed the dog-eared copy on to a friend while traveling in France. She opted to stay in with Jamie some nights instead of going out. The stories are well-researched, rich in imagery and the characters are so vivid, they are almost touchable. And boy, wouldn't we all like to touch Jamie!"
5,Time Traveler Extraodinaire,"Great storyteller!! Ms. Gabaldon paints word pictures so completely that as you read you can see the characters and their surroundings. The concept is so fascinating, I think I would like to try it...to the future though ! ! !"
5,This book (the whole series) are simply the best,"I have read the whole Outlander series, and I must say they are the best books I have ever read. I am not much into cheesy romance novels, but these books are perfection. They are very deep, but do play on fantasy. I recommed these books to everyone."
1,Poor pacing difficult to get through not holding my attention,i have to admit I'm not a romance reader. I downloaded Outlander thinking it was sci fi/fantasy. I kept reading because Gabaldon has a good ear for dialogue & the pacing of the novel was decent despite the fact that I find Claire a perfectly hateful character.Dragonfly follows up Outlander without the pacing and quite frankly without much interesting happening to the point where I cant make it past the first 90 pages of the book. Bored out of my mind and not wasting any more of my time. Wish I could get my money back because the interesting stuff drops off shortly after the sample section ends.I am officially done with the series and with Gabaldon!
1,Not Worth The Time or Money,"A friend gave me the first book ""Outlander"" for Christmas one year. I read through it without putting it down, then immediately ran out and bought the sequel. Boy, was I sorely disappointed. It was long, boring and had none of the romantic escapism that pulls you into the first one. All long relationships experience strain. It's part of life. But if I wanted to experience a couple's tragedy & near break up, I wouldn't need to buy a book to do it. I can experience that in any number of ways in real life. Do yourself a favor, stick to the first book and focus the time and money you would have put into this book, into your own relationship."
2,DRAGONFLY IN AMBER,"The book, second in this series by Diana Gabaldon, is good. I am rating the company I purchased it from, Blue Ridge Books. The book arrived in a timely manner but the condition of the book is less than what they described. The cover was torn apart and in very bad shape. However, the hardback cover and the book itself was in good condition but obviously old."
1,"Sad excuse for ""historic novel""",If you like Hustler you will love this book - if I wanted Pornography I would order it on Pay per View. Totally unnecessary porn as in Mister Raymond putting fingers into Claire's vagina in order to save her life! Randall buggering Jamie and Jamie letting him after Randall had already let Claire leave. Yeah I know he gave his word of honor but I don't believe any true Highlander would let himself be buggered for the sake of honor. If you are anything like me you will find yourself skipping pages at a time in order to avoid this trash.Boring to the point of fatigue through a lot of it. If you are having trouble sleeping this is the book for you.Maudlin enough at times to bring on nausea.Crisis after crisis after crisis and all they have to do after each crisis is bang each other's brains out and that makes everything all right.I'm sorry I had to give it one star.
4,"A wonderful book, but slow at times for me.","I just finished this 2nd book in the Outlander series and I enjoyed the book very much. I was really into it at the beginning and toward the end, but throughout the middle of the book it was very slow and boring at times. I had a hard time finishing this one where as Outlander I read through very fast because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen. I really loved the ending of this book. It gave me chills when I found out Jamie was still alive (although I knew so in the back of my mind anyway). I think there was a lot in this book that didn't really need to be in it. I still loved the book and enjoyed reading it, but she could have left out a lot and it would have been just as good if not better. I haven't finished the other books, but am hoping they aren't all as slow as this one was."
2,Well Written but Too Slow for Me,"I don't normally review books, but felt motivated to write a review for this book, simply because I was sooooo disappointed in it! I really wanted to like this book. I loved Outlander and was excited to have a new series to read that would last for a long time. I saved reading Dragonfly for a time when I needed a good pick me up; however, I just couldn't get into it. I found it sooo dull that I finally stopped reading it after about 200 pages. I rarely stop a book in the middle, and was reluctant to do so here. I kept reading hoping that it would get interesting any minute, but finally I got too bored and just gave up. Big bummer. I am still giving it 2 stars because it was obviously meticulously researched and was well written. It was just way too slow for me."
2,"Not as sadistic as the first book, but still . . .","If this is what historical romance is about, I've had enough. The author's idea of challenge for her protagonists usually involves sexual assault. I unfortunately ordered this second novel in the series before I had read the first one (""Outlander"") on a recommendation. That book indulges in equal-opportunity sadism as a device for drawing her hero and heroine together. The distasteful voyeurism was startling to me and quite offensive. This sequel appears to be much more involved in historical events, but about halfway through the same victimizing tropes appear. All I can say is, ugh."
5,Fantastic,After finishing several historical series I was at a bit of a loss what to pick up next. Luckly I came accross this series. The characters are fantastic and I coudn't put the books down (lots of late weeknights and sleepy eyes at work the next day)I very much reccomend these for a great read.
5,Time Travel Saga Continues,"It probably has been over a year since I read ""Outlander"" and I knew that was a mistake as soon as I began reading DIA. I thought I must have forgotten some things, including the ending, in the first book. I had read ""Outlander"" on my Kindle, so I immediately searched it to find the dates involved and to determine if I had missed Brianna in it. I won't wait a year to read the third book in this series!DIA continues the time travel saga of Claire. It begins in 1968, but it does go back to the 1700s to approximately the same time where ""Outlander"" left off. Claire and Jamie are once more the main characters and it includes several others whom we met in the first book. It also introduces some new people, both in 1968 and in the 1700s.I enjoyed the story and the historical backdrop. I also appreciated the proofreading that someone did. All too many books today seem to have been edited only by a spellchecker. I only found one or two typos in this 1,000 page book."
5,Still in Love,"As ever, a fabulous read! This book, like all the rest, kept me riveted until the very last page. I love how their story never seems to end. It's a good plot, has amazing characters, and there is something for everyone. It's exactly why I hope there are ten more where these came from."
4,Jamie Fraser,Who would not want a man like that???? Love this author and plan to read the entire series. Good work Diana Gabaldon.
4,dragonfly,"The series by Diana Gabaldon is fabulous. I know this because I have read the entire series, and I am now determined to listen. I love all the historical, geographical and cultural aspects that Gabaldon shares with her readers. Extensive research has gone into her books, and I would find negative criticism difficult unless I could claim to be as knowledgeable.Some readers haven't enjoyed the slow action of this second book, but if you intend to read the series, don't skip ""Dragonfly in Amber."""
5,Hard to put down,The story is so well-written I feel like I'm right there with Claire and Jamie. Can't Wait to see where the next book takes them on their journey!
5,SPOILER,"Im glad they went back and reviewed what happened at Culloden (however you spell it) I thought at the beginning they were just going to skip but it was well introduced. The war does get a little slow, lots of killing but great book. You need to read the series to understand anything."
3,Slogfest is apt,"While the author's writing has some virtues and interest, it seems she never, ever, uses a mere 5 wordes when she can use 500 instead. Or preferably 5000."
2,There must be something wrong with me because I thought it was boring,"I don't get why this book is so popular. I liked OUTLANDER. Very readable. Fun. Unique love story, but this one is a real struggle.I gave up on it 640 pages in after 3 months of TRYING, trying TRYING to get through this book.It's slow to start. The first time I tried to read DRAGONFLY I only got about 40 pages in before giving up. You think Brianna is going to be a larger part of the story but she's not. The part in France is pretty good, but it takes about 200 pages to get there, and the fun abruptly ends and they head back to Scotland. Scotland is where it gets boring again.Also, the back suggests that there is a lot of hot sexy action, but there is none."
2,unsure,"At a used bookstore, the owner and a lady were talking about this book. The owner told me to just read the 2nd one, because the book repeats so much. A 100 pages in, I knew I was missing a lot. I went to Books A Million and realized the store owner sold me the 3rd book in the series. So i bought Outlander and this 1nd book. Outlander was pretty good, I have read far better books. Now I am dragging through on this one, skipping pages. I know what happens from starting the 3rd book. The Randall raping of Jamie, is just plain disgusting and not what I expect in historical fiction/love story/novel, whatever this book is classified in. I will continue to skip pages and just finish this book, eventually."
4,I just kept reading and couldn't stop!!,"Okay, so ""Outlander"" was wonderful...I read it in about two days...I had bought ""Dragonfly In Amber"" and ""Voyager"" along with it so once I was finished with one I could start the next. Four days later and no sleep...I finished the three. I loved ""outlander""...but this book grabbed me. I just could not put this down! Granted, there are some very graphic parts to these books, but, if you love the historical aspect and the descriptions of the times, you will fall in love. I laughed, I cried, I cringed, I sighed...I am in a full run to buy the next two!!"
4,Dragonfly In Amber,I am really enjoying the Outlander series. Dragonfly In Amber was a little dark because the entire book was leading up to a battle where history tells you the Scots lost but even at the end of the battle they were hunted and slaughtered for years. Over all it was a good book and I would recommend it.
5,Very good!,"I was hooked once I read the first book in this series called Outlander. I plan on reading the 5 books that follow. Very interesting. It contains time travel, lots of history about Scotland, war and love!"
3,Too much writing - not enough content,"The overall concept of this series - time travel, clash of cultures, romantic/historical fiction - is very compelling. However, in the series in general and in this book in particular, Ms. Gabaldon advances the plot at an agonizingly slow pace. Her writing is frequently elegant, even charming, and at times powerful and moving with effective descriptive passages and dialogue. Unfortunately, there is an excessive amount of text devoted to basic exposition and plot advancement. The interactions between Claire and Jamie are often tedious and repetitious, as are Claire's frequent rhapsodizing over his features, muscles, skin, hair, etc. This book would have benefited from some strenuous editing and more consistent narrative momentum. Despite these shortcoming, I will likely grind my way through the whole series."
2,Meh...,"Well, so far, not so good. After devouring Outlander (book 1) I immediately purchased this book. I'm 12% through it and really losing interest, quick...There is a bit of a confusing person change (the author goes from saying ""I"" to saying ""Claire"" and then back again). And so far, I feel nothing for any of the other characters (except Jamie and Claire). Even Jamie (sadly) seems flatter.There is a lot less romance and a lot more sex in this book, which is completely unnecessary, if you ask me.I will finish this book, if I can. I'm hoping that the next book(s) will be better."
2,Too much,"Not as good as first. Starts out wonderfully, then focuses too much on the love story. I get they are in love. Then it just drones on and on about her nursing the sick and wounded. Boring."
4,Book Crush Inducing,"Coming off of an Outlander high, I was initially disappointed in this second installment. But not for long! I didn't want to leave Scotland and the company of James Fraser but thankfully Gabaldon saw fit to take her readers back to him through his and Claire's story passed on to their daughter in 20th century America. Only slightly less engaging, this book rounds out the story and prepares you for the journey's continuation. We couldn't have the third one without the second :0)."
4,Outlander series,"If you enjoy historical fiction then this is for you. Fast developing , well written , it holds your interest from beginning to end."
5,Supernatural historical romance - love it!,"I love books that assume you have a mind - and include romance. This sequel to Outlander is brilliantly engineered....I was breathless throughout this book, and so glad I discovered this series late in the game, so I could go on to the next book, Voyager.... and see what happened next. Waiting would have been sheer torture!Beautifully written devotion, interesting, realistic historical aspect - very intriguing. Very glad to find authors who can explore married love and passion and are at the same time intellectual. - I love the Twilight Series and am glad to have discovered Gabaldon and am currently reading this book (and the entire series). Until these two series, frankly had given up on romantic fiction. Stephenie Meyer and Diana Gabaldon have done great work in creating strong, ethical people - with integrity. Diana has done it in a more mature style with unforgettable characters!"
5,An incredibly well-written story of love through time and in one of history's most intriguing settings,"WOW- that is all I can say. Diana Gabaldon is a extraordinary writer. She has complete command of her craft both is eloquence, style and story. I have read ALL of the books in this series and find them all incredibly creative, well executed and a plesaure to read- her voice is captivating. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a marvelous love story, a lesson in history and the times of the 17th century Europe and intrigue that will keep you turning pages to the wee hours!"
5,In one word--exhausting.,"Like Outlander and the ones after it, this one is not only large in length but in literary fiction in ranks with the best. I'm looking forward to reading her other books"
2,Why?,"This show has produced some great musical moments. Unfortunatley, none of them are on this cd. Who can forget, Melissa Etheridge's { Testify} or Don Henley's ( Boys of Summer) and the list goes on. This collection does not live up to the show and I would recommend passing on this collection and hope for a Vol 2."
4,Nice collection from a cool show...,"Nice collection from a cool show. Includes David Bowie, Stevie Nicks, Pretenders, Counting Crows, Dave Matthews, Lisa Loeb, John Popper, James Taylor, Sheryl Crow, Eurythmics, Natalie Merchant, John Melloncamp, Elvis Costello, The Bee Gees and ""surprise...surprise"" the strongest cut Who Will Save Your Soul by Jewel. They did it right by not including the preceding story of each song on the CD but they did print them on the liner notes, therefore you won't have to listed to intro over and over. But where's the original storyteller Ray Davies? And wouldn't Bruce Springsteen be great on this show?"
4,Very good CD,"The recordings on this disc are great! Contrary to the editorial review, I think Jewel's version of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" is really good and you won't find it anywhere else. Thats what I like about ALL the songs. I just don't understand the thinking behind taking out the stories from the CD. It can hardly be called a Storytellers disc then. There are stories in the liner notes from each performer, but only excerpts. But, all in all, its a very good disc and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Works in some situations,"My main complaint is that these are not very tall so in cases where the bottom of the door is significantly higher the floor, these do not work."
3,Not his best but pretty good,"One of the reasons this isn't as well known as Jim Thompson's other books is that it isn't as solidly plotted. Instead it's sort of a stylistic thing, where he's writing from multiple character perspectives but as if each was being completely open and honest. I read somewhere he was a fan of Dostoevsky and this is sort of a white-trash small-town take on how the Russian approached Raskolkinov in Crime and Punishment."
4,Great 70s rock,"The Dogs were not really punk (they formed in 1970), and were not really early 70s hard rock either, but kind of a mix of 60s Detroit rock, 70s LA hard rock, and even Real Kids-type garage rock and power pop, if that makes any sense. Most of this CD is taken from a tape of a live show at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens in January 1977, where The Dogs certainly exhibited some raw power. My favorite is ""Younger Point of View,"" which deals with important or, at least, well known late 60s events from ""a younger point of view"" in a ferocious and dramatic classic rock fashion. ""Sleaze City"" is also a good one. Hard rock and garage rock fans can't go wrong by buying this CD."
