3,OK Nailer,"I was excited to purchase this nailer based on its ability to drive pins in excess of 1 inch. When it arrived I was pleased with the construction of the unit, very well made in the true Bostitch tradition. Upon immediately firing up my compressor to see what the unit will do, I was disappointed to see that it had a problem driving the 1 3/16 inch pins all the way into hardwood, in this case red oak. I tried different settings and even with the PSI set to max the pins would not countersink. I had to use a nail punch to finish the job, which is counter intuitive to why you would use a pin nailer to begin with. Other than that the nailer performs flawlessly, never jamming, etc. And by the way, the 1 3/6 pins are tough to come by. I have not seen them in any of my local home improvement or hardware stores. They are available through Amazon however, so you can stock up there."
2,Bostitch HP118K Pin Nailer,"I was not able to make it sink one pin in any material. Those little pins hurt when you run your finger over them! Maybe I got a bad one. It is in the shop now being checked. My partner has a Grex and has had no trouble at all. I went with the Bostitch because I have had great service from their other products. If you buy this gun and have trouble, send it back before the return deadline."
2,Safety Concerns,The Bostitch Pin Nailer is doing its basic function fine. I can only give it a 2 star because it has in my opinion a major design flaw. It is very easy to press both handles simultaneously to initiate the nailing. This makes it very easy to have the nail come out accidentally insuring somebody. I have never seen a nail gun in which it so easy to make a mistake in this way.
4,Performed as expected,"Did exactly what it was supposed to do right out of the box. Pin holes barely visible and pins are sunk below the surface. Only thing I didn't like is the extra safety trigger. After working with brad nailers and staplers that do not have the safety trigger, I find it cumbersome. Will probably remove it."
3,Disappointing. Doesn't countersink pins.,This is my first pin nailer and for the most part I'm happy with it. My only complaint is that it doesn't countersink pins. They stay even with the wood surface. Even though the pins are tiny you can still see them from up close. I do finish carpentry work and it would be nice if the pins got driven below the wood surface so that I could touch up the holes. My buddy has a Porter Cable 23 guage pin nailer and it does countersink the pins. If I had to do it over I would get the Porter Cable.
3,The Head Shows,"The head of the pin shows, because the gun doesnt set the pin deep enough. I am very dissapointed about this problem!! ps. No matter the air pressure."
3,Doesn't countersink pins,"The good news is that it did drive the 1- 3/16 pins into solid maple. The problem is that it doesn't countersink them. The manual says it is designed to leave the pins just below the surface. This does not give the look I want ... Either a small hole I can easily fill, or a hole so small you could just leave it unfilled. If I had known this prior to purchasing I wouldn't have bought this one. I am considering returning this one and getting a different brand."
4,Perfect fit for the DIY user,After spending far too long reading reviews on this gun And the more expensive ones .... I decided this would be fine for the limited use I would put it through. So far it has performed flawlessly for me. It countersinks without a problem when set to the correct pressure. My one complaint it that you have to be very careful with soft woods as there is no non marring tip for this gun. Once you get use to pressing lightly you are in the clear. And to build on what others has said BE CAREFUL WITH THIS GUN. Te safety can Hardly be called a safety. It is very easy to fire a pin off in the air when grabbing for the gun.
3,just so so,"I use this for two reasons.1 so as not to split wood with a larger 18ga brad.2 for a less noticable hole.The short comings of this pinner is its lack of power in the depth drive.It only barley sets the pin. which makes it tough to fill. I've often had to get out a nail set because its flush with the surface, which makes an even larger hole."
4,buy extra nails.....but not from Amazon!,"I love this nailer, now that I got one that works, the first one sent by Amazon whould not even drive the one inch nails flush no less countersink them. I think Bostitch must be getting a lot of complaints on this issue. I sent it back and received a second one and it works perfect, the only problem was the shippment of nails... the box came loose durning shipping and I was playing 1,000 nail pick-up! These nails are tiny, thats why they are called ""pins"" but when the glue which holds these pins togeather come apart durning shipping they are usless, they cannot be used in the gun. I went to my local Woodcraft and purchased a selection of Porter-Cable 23 gauge pin nails at a very reasonable price. The Porter cable pin work great in the gun."
4,Take a look at ourselves!,"I don't get the world of fashion. It all seems like ridiculous clothes that no one would wear or could afford. Yet it generates millions of dollars a year.But the makers of Stardom do know enough to make you laugh. This movie is terrific. It's as artsy and pretentious as the people it makes fun of. for example, all the whole movie is seen as footage taken from other filmmakers and tv shows. It mercilessly pokes fun at models, designers, rich people, and fashion.Overall its a excellent movie with a lot of inovation, good acting, and laughs."
4,Sympathy for the MTV Generation?,"Having watched and enjoyed Jesus of M., I picked this up -despite- what looked like a rather cliched premise - I'm -very- glad that I did. While told in a fashion sure to appeal to ADD sufferers everywhere (...) this is a highly taut, biting inquisition on celebrity, sex and everything else irrelevant in life. This movie shows exactly how most people think about the entire modern media world.Having a super-model playing a super-model works better than you (or do I mean I?) might think - and the supporting cast all turn in good to excellent performances. -very- worth a watch."
1,Baby Talk,"Perhaps the worst baby book ever thrown together. It seems the author decided to release a book for no purpose other than to release one. Sorry, I must give the plot away. On the first page the word ""Hi"" has a corresponding photo of a child. I say corresponding only in the sense that the picture is opposite the page of the word. The photo does not match up with the word. That's what's surprising, NONE of the photos of the babies/toddlers expressions have any connection whatsoever with correspoding word. Sorry, I'll go ahaead and give the rest of the plot away. The other words without any connection to the photos are: No, Mine, Cheese, and Okay. Seriously, I think the author should have at least spent 2 extra minutes to find baby photos that were similiar to the words or changed the words to match the photos. Oh, by the way, my child looked at page one, grabbed the book and tossed it! So does this count as 2 reviews?"
3,A little disappointed,"I expected more about this book. It is another of these books where the author wants to show the world how fancy he can write. The end result is a boring text. I'd much prefer if the author had written in a straight-forward manner without trying to impress himself. The book is badly organized, the author inserted pages about older models randomly in the middle of the book, and the book doesn't follow a chronological order."
1,Offers healing but instead blames the wounded ---,"I would not recommend this book to anyone trying to understand and recover from childhood trauma or abuse. She is arrogant, self righteous and critical of the victim. In my opinion, not the voice that anyone needs to hear in order to heal."
2,Good points but too much talk,"This book has some good points. I bought it after I saw the author on Oprah. I thought what she had to say made sense to me. I also felt she knew what she was talking about -Tough love-. However, you will not get much more of the book than what she already had to say on the show. It is too long, too boring for my personal taste and leaves me wondering, why did I bother?"
3,heal or no heal?,"i was alerted to this author by my spiritual director, but i don't find it particularly spiritual. i think it is too simplistic for such a monumental mental health problem."
2,review,The book is very basic and repetitive; a good introduction to the ideas but boring if you know anything about the subject.
5,"Power sources: spiritual, emotional, physical, etc.","Be sure to read the introduction! Myss parallels the symbolism of the sacraments of the Christian church, the Tree of Life of the Kabbalistic tradition and the Hindu chakras. The Tribal, Individual and Symbolic ages are explained. The archetypes, made widely known to us by Jung, are uplifted as a way to see the events of our lives in symbolic terms. The 3-page Epilogue ""Snow White and the Seven Chakras"" might be read first as another introduction to the scope of the messages of this book, then re-read as a review. Many personal stores are recounted, including Myss' own healing experience, as examples of the principles cited. This book is uplifting and informative. It ties together things we have read in many other books into a helpful whole."
3,Why People Don't Heal and How They Can,I love Caroline Myss and all her writing but this book did not reach me. Probably it is just me because she knows what she is writing about. Half of reading has to be the reader. The writer can't do it all. So give it a chance because it may be just what you need.
5,WHY PEOPLE DONT HEAL AND HOW THEY CAN,"I believe this book was written with very professional insight, the complete human being, ages of history, respect for the known as well as the unknown . with a extraordinary writing skill. a blessing of knowledge. understanding of mankind.JohnR."
1,This is a negative review and should provide some balance.,"This is one of the most mean spirited books I have ever had the misfortune to read. The treatment of the incest survivor in the Findhorn Community dining room is particularly ugly involving an apparently flagrant disregard for limits and lack of respect for the woman's personal boundaries, no matter what her flaws might be. The criticism of such people who exhibit ""woundology"", the main thrust of the book, reeks of hubris. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Instead read anything by a TRAINED and EDUCATED Jungian. (please be advised that this is a revision of the review I sent earlier and should replace it.)"
2,Mean-spirited and circular,"Myss makes a good point when she talk about people wearing their wounds as badges of honor..then proceeds to trash a woman for making a casual comment about her incest support group. The book is too full of these examples of people Myss deems as not ready to heal. Like a lot of fuzzy New Age thinking, her book presents arguments that allow her to have her cake and eat it, too. If you ""heal,"" then it means you have ""forgiven,"" according to Myss. If you don't, it's probably because you aren't ready to heal. Either way, you've bought Myss' book and earned her some money."
4,Comprehensive help for novelists,"Finally a book on how to write a bestseller - from someone who has actually done so! Whether or not Celia Brayfield's books are your cup of tea, you can't deny that she knows the formula for writing a successful book. Here she shares her secrets, from what makes a bestseller and why people read them, to finding your story and characters, planning the book, getting on with writing, and what to do when you get stuck. Researching backgrounds is covered, along with how to navigate the minefield of finding an agent and publisher. Not bad for 250 pages! Even if you are not trying to write a novel that fits the formula of a 'bestseller', you'll still find Brayfield's advice invaluable. If you only buy one book on writing, this should be the one."
5,Firewire 2-Port Expresscard,Great product. Especially useful on older laptop computer. My daughter has used this expresscard when doing her video work. Good item to have at a good value.
1,possibly incompatible with vista,"just sharing my experience with this product. i have a shiny new laptop with the *ever-lovely* vista on it. inserted the expresscard - plugged in my new 250GB external hard drive - started clicking around but within 2 minutes got an I/O error. I unplugged everything, restarted and my hard drive now cannot be accessed. tried accessing my hard drive on different computers but to no avail.so buyer beware - i'm not 100% positive what caused this to happen, may have been a fluke, but its not worth finding out the hard way. find another firewire expresscard port and make sure that its vista compatible. or even better, remove vista all together from your machine"
2,Basic Industry colour...and not much else,"The book is a very basic overview of hedge fund industry developments. It is important to note that the history stops at 1999 and that there have been a number of significant industry developments since then. As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, the most interesting aspect of the book is the short articles from fund managers who have started their own funds with as little as $1 million in assets under management.For those seeking a greater insight into the risk management techniques employed by hedge funds, or the basic ""How to's"" of starting a fund....this is not the book for you."
4,"Solid, if unexceptional","This book is a good introduction to the world of hedge funds--what they are, where they come from, and, most importantly, how they make money. Strachman is clearly a believer in the industry, and readers not familiar with the investment techniques described would do well to take some of his claims with a grain of salt (specifically, that the managers profiled necessarily know what they're doing). This book will not equip you to run your own fund, but it will give you a sense of the landscape."
5,Taking the mystery out of hedge funds.,"Strachman does an excellent job explaining the world of hedge funds from many perspectives--the strategies, the managers, and the investors-- and puts it all together to form a cohesive picture. The book is written in language an intelligent investor can understand, even without previous experience with these sometimes exotic investment vehicles. This book is an excellent resource both for beginning an investigation into the possibility of adding hedge funds to your portfolio, or for simply acquainting oneself with this fascinating niche of the investment world."
2,Decent intro to industry . . .but too much useless info,"This book contains way too much fluff. However, I did enjoy the fund manager profiles toward the end of the book."
1,"Save your money, do not buy this book","Was throughly disappointed with this book. The initial chapters of the book just collects information from other published books and presents it. Later chapters interviews hedge fund managers and has stories written about it, instead of technical insights.It contains lots of hedge fund stories (which you can just search on google and get it for free!) rather than useful technical information. Finished reading it in less than 60 min.I will not suggest this book even for the beginnersatish paul"
1,Save your $,Does not really tell you much to get you started in Hedge Funds.Many grammatical errors. About as interesting as your basic business textbook!Save your money!
1,Very basic stuff,Of limited value. Doesn't even really deliver on the cover notes. I'd look elsewhere.
1,What is the fuss about?,"I checked out this book mainly because I went to College with Strachman. Although I do not think it is very helpful, I am surprised at all the furror it seems to evoke.Hey, this is not a Pulitzer Prize contender-just a tiny book that does not tell very much! Enough-get a life!"
3,Mediocre,"The problem with this book is that anyone who knows anything about hedge funds will find it too simplistic. And anyone who knows nothing about hedge funds probably should not be playing around with this class of investment.The biggest issue I had with this book is that, as an introduction, it should have provided more information about how one goes about actually investing in hedge funds; how one can find information on specific funds, how to deploy assets, etc. This is a how-to book without the how."
4,Framed By Crooked Politicians,"EACH DAWN I DIE is a movie about a reporter who is framed for manslaughter by crooked politicians and sent to prison where he befriends a hardened criminal. Most of the story takes place in prison as the reporter slowly turns into an embittered inmate. James Cagney stars as the reporter and George Raft plays the part of his prison buddy. The strong supporting cast includes Jane Bryan, George Bancroft, Victor Jury and Maxie Rosenbloom.Director William Keighley also directed THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER and THE FIGHTING 69th."
2,So so,Cliche - only for die-hard Cagney fans. George Raft gives a good performance; Cagney is stiff. The entire movie is predictable.
1,Very disappointing purchase!,I am new to kettlebell workouts and was excited to see that Gin Miller (who I have worked out with in the past) had a DVD. It is obvious that she did not do her research while producing this DVD. Many of the exercises could be done with dumbells and most make no sense. Gin should stick to step aerobics. My advice...don't buy this...keep looking...I will...there must be other workouts out there that are better!
3,Not one of Gin's best,"I adore Gin Miller and have just about every DVD she has released. And for the most part, there is no finer fitness instructor on the planet. However, she misses the mark on this one. She does not demonstrate proper kettlebell form, which probably will not cause injury as long as you stick with a really light kettlebell. However, some of the moves as demonstrated could cause injury if a moderate or heavy kettlebell was used. I recommend sticking with DVDs with instructors who are certified in kettlebell instruction."
2,Not a great kettlebell dvd,"The instruction on this dvd doesn't make a lot of sense. It seems to me the instructor was confused and not real sure of even how to use the kettlebell. For example, she would call your hips ""knees"" instead of hips? And when she says, ""stretch to your right"" she would be stretching to the left? Confusing for sure! Also, she has an annoying way of saying the word ""guys"" a little too much for my taste. Watch at your own risk!"
4,A unique workout,I loved this workout. It was tough and had me dripping sweat. Gin Miller is an awesome instructor...I have followed her for years. She is great at building the exercise so that the participants can be successful.
2,Don't Buy This!!!,"I own several kettlebell dvd's and I wanted to add this one to my collection. I am going to return the product though since I was so disappointed in its quality.For starters, Gin does not demonstrate proper kettlebell form. You could injure your back on her version of swings, and the way she does her snatches makes absolutely no sense.I would recommend buying from Iron Core with Sara Laurie or Kettlebell Goddess with Andrea Du Kane. Both of these dvd's give you a true kettlebell workout, demonstrate proper form and are significantly harder."
4,Clear instruction and cuing; good overall workout.,"I am new to kettebell and not a ""purist."" I really like the cuing and instruction Gin provides in the video. It was just what I needed to get started with this type of strength training. My only complaint is that the video is not chaptered to ""play all""; you have to keep selecting which part of the routine you would like to complete. Other than that, this is a good workout."
4,Super Kettlebell Workout,"Gin Miller's Calorie Burner Workout with KettlebellsI found Gin Miller to be an excellent instructor, she explains each exercise movement in detail. It's nice to see an instructor that has curves but is very fit. Please, start off with the proper size kettlebell. Since I've been exercising for a number of years, I made the mistake of buying a 15lb kettlebell. I was 5 minutes into the DVD and I realized I needed a much lighter kettlebell. I downsized to a 10lb kettlebell. Now I can get through the DVD. What a fantastic workout. You work your entire body in a short period of time. This DVD is a winner."
2,Very disappointing offering from Gin,"When I heard that Gin was coming out with a workout, I had the highest expectations. A workout combining an instructor I love with a form of exerice I love. What could be better?But I have to agree with the reviewer who said it looks like Gin just jumped on the KB bandwagon. Gin usually gives good form tips and safe exercises. This is NOT the case with this workout. Some moves are awkward, and some are an injury waiting to happen. Gin's form is also quite poor on some moves, even the basic swing.Those with some experience in KB's, like myself, could modify some of the moves, and perform others with correct form, and there is a quite nice, effective standing under-the-leg pass move that is unique, but I found it wasn't worth the bother. I used it once, then put it on my Ebay pile.Those who have no KB background would be well advised to stay clear, as they could risk injury."
5,Another Effective Workout from Gin!,"This is my second workout DVD from Gin Miller. Gin is an amazing trainer. She motivates you with her beautiful personality and sense of humor. You actually feel as though she is right there with you, encouraging you. The workout itself is very effective. I feel that good kind of sore the next day, and it helps to improve those trouble spots - triceps and upper thighs. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Gin and this DVD. I highly recommend it!"
2,Kettlebell,Boring. Not much else to say. Not as good as the workout DVD by Angie Miller. If you are just looking for a beginner set this would probably do.
1,Not Kettlebells!,"It is obvious after watching this DVD that Gin was just interested in ""jumping on the kettlebell bandwagon"". This DVD is not kettlebell training at all and at times the exercises she invented are quite dangerous. Do yourself a favor, skip this one, and get a kettlebell DVD that is made by an actual certified kettlebell trainer (RKC). You will get better results and won't get hurt!"
5,MOVE OVER DILLARD AND UPDIKE,"I'd never heard of Duncan until a well-read, well-bred friend ""highly recommended"" this new author. Annie Dillard and John Updike included, seldom have I read such powerful prose. Add to that incisive wit, profound human and spiritual insight, and a compelling story, and you've got a winner. I burned the midnight oil to get through this inspiring novel the first time, then immediately read it again slowly to savor the sheer lyrical beauty of the language and subtle nuances of plot. I thank my friend for turning me on to this great novel. And, like her, I highly recommend Duncan to you."
4,Hard to Put Dow,"Feather in the Wind is an exquisitely written, beautiful story of human and spiritual struggle. The friend who recommended it to me quoted the person who recommended it to her as saying, ""Next to the Bible, the best book I've ever read."" Inspirational and heart-touching, it is excellently paced with touches of humor at just the right places. You'll laugh and cry. You will be engaged by the story and enchanted by the beauty of the language."
5,"A Novel for All Those ""Left Behind""","A glorious weaving of mystery-romance and inspirational fiction. I noted this novel was published in 1999. All of its pre-millennium prophecies have already proven true! And its central Biblically prophetic theme -- a satanic strategy to keep lowering the bar of human values -- continues to prove truer with each passing day. If you are among those still ""Left Behind,"" do yourself a favor and put this thought-provoking, beautifully written novel at the top of your ""must read"" list."
2,"Poorly edited, but a few useful tidbits","The first few chapters got me up to speed on how to get around Flash and make simple animations, etc. However the last half of the book was too cursory and provided very little information on how to publish your Flash documents on the web. Additionally, many areas in this book are not up-to-date for Flash MX and instead actually refer to the Flash 5 version. My final recommendation is look for another intro Flash MX book because this one does a half-ass job, even for a Dummy for like me."
1,Waste of Money,"""I was not impressed with the Power Abs Medicine Ball workout. I think I was overcharged for the video and I had to buy the medicine ball seperate. What I did not realize, was that my medicine ball came with a 24 minute workout that is awesome! The total cost of medical ball and workout video from Walmart was $11. It is way better than the Gin Miller's Power Abs workout DVD that I bought. I should have bought the ball first and not wasted my money on this DVD."""
1,Bad,"The picture makes it look hard, but in actual, no it is not hard. It is soft~ This case could keep 2 paddles. It look cheap. Just buy a cheap case from other brand for like $10 instead wasting $35 on this bad case~"
3,Some neat thoughts about gender...,"This story works with gender identification. The main character is a girl who enjoys playing baseball. Her mother believes that she must balance this activity with a more feminine activity and so enrolls her in ballet. The plot is activated by some nice reversals. The art is full-page, watercolor and pastel. It is colorful and depicts an unstructured world: both figures and architectural elements are melted and out-of-kilter. I think the style has limited appeal. The illustrations miss the opportunity to depict the main character's fantasies in a manner distinct from the portrayal of reality. As such, readers may not fully understand that certain scenes occur only as a projection. While there is some multicultural representation among the humans inhabiting the story, the main characters are clearly Anglo-American."
5,What can I say? This is a dreamboat!,"I don't know what I can say about this! It's an INCREDIBLE printer, a fast fax, all-in-one copier, and great feed-through scanner at an affordable price. It's small and fairly quiet, and since it is from Hewlett-Packard you know ink cartridges and great customer service will always be available. This can scan legal-sized documents and prints excellent-quality photographs even on plain-paper. What else can I say?! Grab this TODAY!"
1,Horrible,"First it took them about month and a half to send me this product. When I received It was opened. I tried to return it, but they just ignored my request. Do NOT BUY form this provider."
5,Perfect Language Book for Verbs,This book came in good condition. The verbs are conjugated easily to understand and they are also used in sentences. Goood book for students or people who want to learn Polish and it is fantastic for people who are having trouble with the verb endings.
2,UNACCEPTABLE!!!!,"THIS COLLECTION IS MISSING ""PICKIN' UP PIECES"" WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!! AND EVEN MORE, CONSIDERING THAT ""PICKIN' UP PIECES"" IS HER BIGGEST HIT ON THE BILLBOARD DANCE CHART (#9), AND HER ONLY ONE TOP TEN IN THE SAME LIST!!! TO CONSIDER THIS A COLLECTION, THIS MUST HAVE INCLUDED BOTH THE VOCAL LONG VERSION (6:38) AND THE DUB MIX (6:28) OF PICKIN' UP PIECES. THIS CLUB COLLECTION IS A JOKE, IT DOES NOT HAVE HER BIGGEST HIT AND THAT'S IT!!!!"
5,Smooth,"Great mouthpiece. It makes sound my chinese Soprano Sax like a Selmer or a Yamaha. Feels very weak when you touch it, but it boost my sound."
2,Not Happy in WY,I bought this piece of junk at one of the warehouse stores. After a year the DVD headed south. I wouldn't reccomend this unit to anyone.
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this for my daughter last year for her birthday and the dvd player stopped working after 2 months. I exchanged it for another one and it did better, 6 months before it died completely."
4,Beautiful Voice,Stephen Dunn has a beautiful voice that is in no way preachy or condescending to the reader. His poems are easy on the eyes and healing for the heart.S. Rea
2,Not up to the task,"I purchased this just under a year ago after my $40 blender died a smokey death. I decided to get a ""good"" one this time since buying a blender every year is getting old. At $150 it was not as expensive as the $500 Vita-Mix but more than I was used to spending. My first impression was that it wasn't any more powerful than my prior $40 blender. It wasn't really better in any way. The blender worked good with liquidy items but couldn't muscle through anything like smoothies or malts. Sadly after a smoothie every weekend it only lasted 42 smoothies and the smoke started pouring out. TOAST! Actually, it smelled bad from the start during thick stuff. Go cheap or go expensive. This one is a waste of money since it seems to preform the same as a much cheaper version."
1,Crappy,this is not worth the money.the plastic parts that drive the blades broke after 2 months of mixing smoothies- one per day.a pain to put together... do it JUST RIGHT or it will leak.but that's not a problem anymore... today it died.
3,It blends.,I have had this blender for a year or two now and it still works fine. I bought it to match my Viking range. Is it worth the money? Probably not. You can get an American made Waring blender for $50. This is $180 and it is Chinese. It has a powerful motor but I always get this unpleasant burning rubber smell when I use it. It is not a strong smell that fills up the room or anything but it is annoying. The pitcher and blade are machine washable which is nice but that is irrelevant to me because I have a Viking dishwasher so I have to wash it by hand.
5,chocolate box of 20th-century thinking,"This is a fantastic sampling of American memoir and reflections on race, gender, nature, literature, and other topics of broad interest. It features the century's greatest, starting with Twain, ending with Bellow. The volume is beautifully introduced by Atwan and Oates, both of whom help chip away at the manifold mystery of what makes a good essay. If memoir is of particular interest to you, you will appreciate the poetic sensibilities of the writers. The position essays are equally lucid. I will be teaching a course shortly on developing narrative style and feel fortunate to have stumbled upon this collection. For readers who are looking for varied and pleasant readings, the works in this book will provide that with a challenging edge."
2,A Typical Academic's View,"I'm afraid I must dissent from the slavering praise others have betowed upon this collection. It is purely the work of an academic who cannot conceive that any anthology would be complete with out the over-rated bombast of such as Maya Angelou. This latter statement is heresy in academe, of course, but there it is -- I'm not one of them. This collection should have been called ""The Essays of the Century Most Likely to Appeal to Liberal Academics,"" since that is certainly all it is. Are the best essays here? Some of them are indeed great. But there are far too many included because of the perceived need to achive ""diversity"" in all things, rather than excellence. It's a familiar problem to all of us, but I think the fact that this collection is contained in an ongoing series without anything in the title to suggest its contents is rather misleading. Be wary!"
3,Could Hardly Get Past The Title,"But I did read many essays here and of course they are fine, for the most part. But with what arrogance did the publisher choose such a title. It puts too much pressure on the essayists here to have that Best and Century invading their words."
5,A Stunning Collection,"In this tome Joyce Carol Oates has collected not only the ""Best American Essays of the Century"", she has collected the most significant and most profound essays of the century; from James Agee's ""Knoxville: Summer of 1915"" to Robert Frost's ""The Figure a Poem Makes"" to Saul Bellow's ""Graven Images"" to Michael Herr's ""Illumination Rounds"" this book serves as a representation and a remembrance of what the 20th century American Essay was and how it evolved."
2,Spoilers below..,"This book started out with a lot of potential. We really get to know the hero in the first section of the book, and the excellent descriptions of Apache customs is the only reason I didn't give this book just one star. But I hated the ""romance"". Even though they are in love, both the hero and heroine marry other people. The heroine is cruelly abused by her husband and gets addicted to drugs. It's just way too depressing. And when the h&h finally consumate their love it is a wham-bam couple of paragraphs that shows no emotion between the couple. The ending is OK, but overall this story was really disappointing."
2,one trick pony,"I purchased this to give as a gift to someone who loves flowerarranging. I was shocked at how repetative this book is withtwo very simple design concepts. One; clear vase, fill inside with same flower, cover with water to rim. Two; take all leaves off the same flower, bundle, rest on the edge of a vase. That's it in the nut shell ! Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,I agree - this book is a one-liner.,"The photos are lovely as is the quality of the flowers themselves, but the ultra-minimalist design approach gets very old very quickly.I visited the George V as well and was disppointed when the compositions changed very infrequntly over the course of two weeks. To top it all off, one night, while dining in the restaurant, a loud crash could be heard when a luggage cart collided with one of the huge glass cylinder displays in the lobby. It was a mess. The funny part was that I had just mentioned to my companion that I thought the location was dangerous and impractical.Floral design shouldn't be dangerous.Flip thorugh this book in a library or bookstore, but don't buy it. Choose one by Paula Pryke instead."
1,horrible,crap this show started off good in the first episode but then went downhill from here. If you actually like this then you must be smoking some good crack.
2,Only for Beginners,"If you have had any college French or are even slightly proficient, this course may be a disappointment to you. There is far too much English spoken, and I was looking for more actual speaking in French."
4,"Hooray, Tata's LPs FINALLY being issued on CD!","I couldn't agree more with the above reviewer - I've been waiting to have Tata Vega's 70s Tamla/Motown LPs FINALLY reissued/remastered on CD, most for the first time - hats off to the amazing David Nathan and his SoulMusic.com label for sharing the magic of Tata with today's audiences. Worth the price of admission alone for the rare Disco Mix of FULL STEAM AHEAD - while you're at it, get the other Tata CDs just released, too!!"
5,CHIRP ON!,"Its a cliche...but this music is timeless. To me it sounds as fresh today as back in 1957. I bought this not for the hits, but for the album tracks, which I hadn't heard before. I think my favorite is ""Rock Me My Baby"", but all of the tracks are superb. FIVE STARS PLUS!"
4,Strong but not strong enough,"Got this to hold up the Topsy Turvey upside down tomato grower, which they don't tell you weighs a ton once it's filled with soil and watered. It ripped 2 previous hangers right off the post.This one held up but just. The weight of the upside down tomato thing actually twisted the wrought iron hanger.I've since thrown the tomato thing in the trash. Total waste of money. Tomatos grow and then rot because of the water draining from the bottom of the bag.This hanger should be more than strong enough for normal hanging baskets."
5,Awesome Plant Hangers,"We could not find more heavy duty plant hangers locally, so we tried these thinking they looked more substantial for outside use--our planters are heavy so we needed huskier hangers that would also hold up on our porch outside. They are super, just as advertised, hold our heavy planters easily, and the swivel feature is great too!!!"
1,Didn't work out of box,"The battery would not hold a charge straight out of box, but at the price it was sold, I knew it would be hit or miss. Order another from a different web site, and it worked. Threw this one away."
5,Quick and accurate,This item arrived even sooner than I expected it and works great. I was a little leary of a battery that cost so much less than what I was finding at other suppliers but I am very pleased with the results.
1,"Arrived broken! and it says it's not returnable! terrible vendor, how can a plastic cone be broken????","yes, this arrived timely. The glass carafe is NOT broken. The plasticcone IS broken and was sealed and packed that way!how do I get this returned???NO returns they tell me!this is such bad customer service."
5,Coffee Time!,I've been using Melitta Coffee Pots for 30 years. There is no better way to make coffe.
2,Not a 10 cup,"was disappointed in this coffee filter. Yes the included carafe is a 10 cup, however the cone filter is not a 10 cup and instead is a 6 cup. Overall a good value for a carafe and cone filter, but item is not what I was lead to believe."
5,Great deal,"This cone filter coffee pot is a great price and I use it everyday. It arrived in perfect condition, with a box of filters, and it's my opinion that drip makes the best cup of coffee. Wouldn't be without it."
3,A stable work horse,"I've used these before when I was a bachelor. They are simple reliable work horses. Designed with ease of use and no mechanical parts,I like things like this. We bought it for camping because the old burner type perculator would always end up with grounds in the coffee and the coffee tasted re-cooked or burnt. Now we simply boil water for my tea and her coffee! Wahhh Lahhh!!! A Simple functional GREAT product!!!"
5,STILL SPECIAL!,"Coffee the old fashioned way is still the best!There is something special in the ""hands-on"" approach to coffee-making,a touch of the oriental tea ritual-and with this generous size,there's plenty for your friends too."
5,Easy to use,Easy to use makes great coffee! Easy to clean in the dishwsher as well. I recommend this product to all coffee drinkers.
5,There is no better cup of coffee!,Being a total coffee snob ( I even took an extra suitcase to Costa Rica just for coffee) I used to use a cappucino machine but once I tried coffee with the Melitta pot and filter I dumped the Cappucino machine. This is the only way to make coffee in my opinion. Coffee pots tend to burn the coffee. Give this a try and I'll bet you never go back to brewed coffee again~ Also who needs all that clutter on the counter. I even take mine camping!
5,Great Coffee Maker,"We've used one of these for years and love the simplicity and the quality of the coffee. I was quite upset when we left our last one behind while on vacation, but found them for sale here on Amazon. The biggest problem with them is finding the No. 6 filters if you need to make more than a couple of cups - they are almost impossible to find in any of our local stores. You can find the No. 4 filters, which will do two large cups, but that is all. If you come across the No. 6 size, you had better stock up."
2,Lid pops off!,"This is the 3rd Melitta Manual Coffeemaker I have had over the years so I'm a fan. BUT, the lid comes off of my most recent purchase and makes quite a mess. SO I have tried to stretch the lid by warming it up, etc., but it still is a very loose fit. Not happy! Seems the quality of the Melitta, like everything else, has gone downhill sorry to say."
1,No hole,I gave the Melitta coffe pot to my 85 year old mother. She made a pot of coffee and there was no hole in the filter. Boiling water poured all over the stove and her hand.
2,JD,"My wife only tried it once, and did not like having to heat the water on the stove, she would rather use her Mr. Coffee, and now I am stuck with it because I cannot return it."
5,Works awesome - a camping must!,"We were very impresses with this simple coffee maker! Took it camping with us the first time last week and worked perfect. It was one of the best cups of coffees we ever had. Just put your filter in, the coffee grounds & add hot water! Then within 5 minutes you have coffee. Woo-hoo!! Made camping even that much more fun!!"
4,A lovely book!,"This charming novel has almost everything one could wish for in a historical romance: well-drawn characters the reader quickly comes to know and love; a vivid sense of time and place; a refreshingly limpid writing style totally in keeping with the novel's historical setting; and a satisfying plot that keeps you turning the pages right up to the end -- an end that came far too soon for this reader.Even absent the professional editing that ""Gift of Love"" would have received had a mainstream publisher had the wisdom to pick it up, this book outshines many a mass-market romance now sitting in glossy splendor on bookstore shelves.So: Are you out there, editors at Avon and Signet and Zebra and Harlequin and Dell? Will one of you be brave enough to step forward and give Mrs. Landenberger a contract to write another book -- a sequel to ""Gift of Love,"" perhaps, or a memoir of her own eventful life? At 93 years young, she surely has other enthralling stories to tell!"
3,Search for the Golden Nuggets in This Book,"Mr. Topchik has written an easy to read book on negativity. While I felt some of the information is overly simplistic, such as the ""Cast of Negativists"", there were other examples that were useful such as Chapter 4, ""Dealing with Pervasive Individual & Team Negativity"".The trust and enablement matrix was also interesting, and the last chapters of the book are worth reading for managers and supervisors who need to be aware of issues around organizational negativity.The book is worth reading for some of the less obvious nuggets offered up."
1,Not worth the money,I started reading this book and really didn't get further than the 3rd chapter.Mostly is seemed to be composed of lists followed by an simplistic explanation of the list.I decided to return it after I read the solution for the Attention Seeker. It seemed to me that the solution would merely reinforce that behavior.I showed the book to a colleague who glanced through it and described it as a 'queer' book.
1,Again--Nothing New,Wondered why I bought the book. It really didn't say much of anything that all the other managment books say. Just had a promising title.
5,Adding Humor to the Workplace,"As this book suggests, one of the best ways to combat workplace negativity is to add some positive humor.One book that can help you find on-the-job humor is WorkLaughs: Quips, Quotes, andAnecdotes about Making a Buck. Like Managing Workplace Negativity it too can be found on Amazon."
5,"Perfect ""next"" book for me","I'm trying to get back into playing piano after many many years, and this book suits me perfectly. I started with ""You CAN play Piano"" by Amy Appleby, and after playing through that book, this one seems like a great next step. Some of the songs I've tried so far are easy enough for me to start with, and I can see that others are currently way too challenging...which is perfect. I feel like I'll be able to spend quite a while mastering this book, but in the meantime I'll be learning beautiful songs. Sure, some of the easier ones don't capture the richness of the full pieces, but for my skill level, they are definitely good enough."
4,Easy Book of Favorites,"As a teacher I plan to use it for familiarizing students with themes. If they choose, we can find a more advanced arrangement. It is good for sight reading."
2,"Easy is right, but w/ caveats","I bought this book, based on my daughter's comments about the PIANO FAVORITES book being too hard. She is a decent piano player, who has to practice in order to play several of the PIANO FAVORITES pieces.But after receiving this ""easy"" one, I believe the simplification utilized for an ""easy piano piece"" reduced and/or killed the loveliness of several pieces I played when I first got the ""big easy"".So being a violin player w/ minimal piano playing skills, I probably should have bought the PIANO FAVORITES book, and just focused on one or two pieces, and learned/memorized them well. And not look at the book as one which I could play any/all pieces."
5,Great item to save energy,"I have five of this timers since 2006, they still work like a charm. I live in Mexico and power is so expensive here, I use them to turn on and off our floor fans so I can program the air conditioning units to turn off after a few hours to save energy. I've used them to turn table lamps on and off when we are not home and avoid burglaries. Today I'm using one to turn on and off our Christmas lights. They have an override switch if you want the appliance to be on all the time."
4,Good Unit but not compatible with some Pocket PC's,Warning for Dell Axim owners - this unit will not connect to Dell Axim's through bluetooth. The software is good enough for the price - it's just like the iGuidance or Routis product. IOGear's web site also states the product is not compatible with Pocket PC's running Windows Mobile 2003!!!Here is the statement below:---------------------------------------------------------Document # 10133TitleGBC201: Incompatibility ListApplies ToGBC201DetailsWe have found that the GBC201 is incompatible with the following PocketPC PDAs.- Dell AXIM series- Any PDA running PocketPC 2003
5,It works on DELL AXIM!!,"The previous post is mistaken this unit with a different (discontinued) IOGEAR product. The IOGEAR GBGPS201 DOES work with DELL AXIM and other PDAs running Windows Mobile 2003!I have successfully tested and used this IOGEAR GPS with DELL AXIM X30, and AXIM X50."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH POcket PC / WM 5.0,"STAY AWAY IF YOU INTEND TO USE WITH A POCKET PC. It will not work on Windows Mobile 5.0, and IOGear knows it. It will slow your device to a crawl. I use a powerful Dell Axim x51 (fastest processor availabel and lots of RAM). They said they would patch it in 2005, but it's almost 2007 and they still haven't.They guy who said it works with his Pocket PC was running WM 2003, and yes, it works with that.iGuidance uses the same software base and they have patched their's. Consider iGuidance if you don't want to have to hook up your laptop to the car just to use GPS. Their customer service is outsourced and unhelpful"
1,In one word - HORRIBLE,"I got this GPS to work with my pocket pc. After instllation it asked to an file called 'IOgearnavsysqvga' but it was nowhere in the instllation cd. I called IOgear support and I asked where I could find the file. I was left on hold for an hour and had to finally hang up. Their support SUCKS! Needless to say, I am unable to install this on my ATT 8525. Don't buy this JUNK or anything else from IOGEAR!"
5,Not enough stars to rate this one,"Absolutely great, very fresh and still feminine. An intriguing perfume that can't be easily forgotten (I recognize it on other women in the tram...). Can be worn from morning to evening without being too much or too little."
5,Yearly gift for my daughter's birthday,She loves it. It came quickly and so vendor is good..no complaints here! It was in one piece too which isx important with a glass bottle!
2,One Heat Setting Does Not Fit All Hair Types,"My niece brought a Chi Flat Iron from a local department store in Texas. She used it on my hair and I fell in love with it. At the time, my hair felt soft and remained straight for a week/until I washed it. So I decided to buy three for myself, my sister and my daughter. My sister and my daughter stated the iron works perfect for them. They both have course hair. But when I bump my hair slightly, it burns it. I've treated my hair with protein treatments shortly after washing it and thermal treatments shortly before flat ironing it. The flat iron still burns my hair. It would help if it had a heat control mechanism on it. I've since pulled out my old faithful."
2,"A Bit Overrated, but Not Bad","The Chi is not for people who have already gotten used to their old hair straightener, especially if the old one is of a good brand. But first-timers will be amazed by the ability of the Chi.Although the box says that the Chi straightens, flips, styles, and curls, all the Chi really does is straighten.It works only slightly better than the regular, drugstore, cheaper hair straighteners."
2,Do Not Buy This Product Off Amazon,I purchased a Chi Straightner off of Amazon a little over three months ago. It is no longer working and they will not exchange it or give me a refund. I had purchased this same straighner at a beauty salon and it lasted me over three years without any problems. I would buy this directly from a salon.
1,Chi flat iron,I own a Chi hair straightener and absolutely love it !! I have had it for 15 months. My daughter wanted one of her own so I ordered it from Amazon Sept 2007 and January 2008 it stopped heating completely. 4 months old !! Amazon would/could not help me. I called Farouk and no help there. They can't guarantee unless purchased at a salon. We need another one to make the mornings easier and I am stumped as to which one to buy. Obviously I'll have to go to a beauty supply store and pay even bigger bucks!!
5,"Great product, great price!",I knew I wanted this particular flat iron as it was recommended by a number of people. The challenge was to find it for a decent price... and I did!! I am very happy with my purchase! I absolutely love this flat iron! It works wonderfully!
3,not impressed,"I have a wave in my hair that doesn't work so well in the warmer seasons, too much frizz. I tried a Conair first then went for the Chi thinking I would get better, smoother results. I'm not impressed. There was no difference between the two and for the money, and numerous other reviews, I expected better.I don't have coarse, or thick hair. My hair is medium long(about 2 inches below shoulder and I have a layer or two that is growing out). I've used the Chi for two mths in various ways, hair damp, sectioning off hair so all layers get ironed, small sections, large sections and the only thing it does better than the Conair is that it glides through the hair better without pulling. The Conair would ""grab"" my hair. I so wanted the Chi to be better. It does work great on my bangs though! They're straight and shiney. Maybe that's the key, to use it on short hair. Save the xtra $$ and get a Conair or Revlon brand."
4,Works great,It heats up quick but I wish there was a way to adjust the heat. My hair is jsut a little wavey and this does the job great
2,Not a real CHI,"per my wife and her friend that owns her own hair salon, this is not a real chi. i started looking and CHI is no where on the iron. Every high end/expensive product always advertises their name."
5,THE BEST PROODUCT IN MY LIFE,This is the best product I ever had in my life ...I just love it!!!And I recomend it to everyone!!!!!!!
1,Another story of not honoring the year warranty,"Just as many reviewers have written before, my flat iron, which I have only used on a handful of occasions since I purchased it around Thanksgiving, has broken. The plug on this flatiron does not work very well. Mine needed a slowly increasing number of presses of the reset button to get it to function until one day when it just would not come back on... This same story seems to be reflected in a large number of other reviewers comments. The customer service at CHI seems to favor the slow death by hold, and Amazon says they cannot replace it but forwards me to CHI. So, 80 bucks down the drain, and I'll look for a flat-iron that A) makes it through the full year of its warranty or B) covers its warranty no matter where you buy it."
5,Curl disaster,"After having my first child, my once very straight hair was now curly. The problem with my new curls was they were not pretty or managable. A friend encouraged me to buy the Chi, and I'm so glad I did! It works great and was well worth the money!"
4,CHI flatiron review,"This is my second Chi flatiron after the electric cord broke on my first (after more than five years of use). At the price, I expect it to last forever, so I was a little annoyed about the cord, but I do love the iron. I straighten and sometimes slightly curl with it. I love how quickly it heats up but I wish it had an automatic shut off."
5,Why did I wait?,I tried cheaper irons. Wasted time and money. Not to mention the bad hair days. CHI is the best. Just get it and be happy.
3,not what i expected....,"When I went to the hair salon for my daughter, they straightened her hair with a chi and it looked so good! The lady who did it said to get a chi. Well, I have an Andis flat iron just like this one and when I got my chi, I tried it on my daughter's hair and I felt that it worked just as good as the Andis. In my opinion, there is not a difference between the two - in fact, I think that the Andis actually works better than the chi and is WAY cheaper. The Andis gets just as hot and just as straight as the Chi. Try the Andis 1 inch; it's much cheaper and works better!"
2,good while it lasted...,"I've had this for less than a year(9 months), and I'd say I use it about 2-4 times a week. It doesn't work properly anymore. I guess there is a shortage in the cord or something. Some times it doesn't turn on, and I have to wiggle the cord and hold it in a certain direction for it to work. Of course, as others stated.. if you buy it online/amazon, the warranty is VOID, so I'm going to have to buy a new one."
4,great product - high price to pay for a piece of hot metal,"I like the product... but I think it is hyped so much. It's a piece of metal that gets heated... kind of like an iron you do you clothes with.. but they only cost $50 and they do steam, spritz water and have auto turn off features. Why could something to do hair be much more to produce?"
2,Chi does not stand behind their products,"I have bought 3 of these straighteners in the past year and a half and every one of them has stopped working after just a few months. I sent the last one in for repair at the cost of shipping on my part PLUS another $35 (after I paid close to $100 for the first two) and the new flat iron died again after just 5-6 months. I'm definitely switching brands because although the Chi flat iron works well when it works, it just doesn't last. Very frustrating."
4,good product- bad seller,"This is by far the best hair straightener I have ever bought. I would just recommend buying it from another seller! It took over a month for the product to get to me, and when it did finally arrive they just left it on the porch. I would never buy from this seller again because of how long they take to ship their products."
2,Works great when it's working,"This product gets hot and works great when it's working. After a few months or weeks after owning it, odds are, you will have a loose wire causing the light not to come on and won't heat up. It can be taken apart and soldered back together if you feel comfortable and handy enough to do that. I have 2 Chi's and both have done the same thing. They do work well other than that, but most people don't want to have to mess with all that. Seems to be a common complaint on the Chi product if you read all the reviews. Warranties are void when purchasing one online so my opinion is ""enter at your own risk"". Hope that helps you decide on this purchase."
4,Great price for a good product,"I bought this product on Amazon because I found it significantly cheaper on Amazon at the time than anywhere else. I received it very quickly in the mail and have been really happy with it so far. It is by far the best straightener I have ever owned. My one concern is that the warranty is void when you buy it on Amazon, but it cost so much less from them that I decided I would take my chances."
2,Disappointing experience...broken after 2 uses.,"I bought my CHI after reading mixed reviews as I wanted to be optimistic. I received my new CHI and the first 2 uses were OUTSTANDING...I was very happy with the product. Then, when I went to use the CHI for the 3rd time, it would not turn on. I tried multiple power outlets, hitting the reset button, etc. I returned it immediately and am very disappointed. I would not buy another from this seller."
2,Do not reccommend,"I bought my CHI hair straightener with the idea that it would last me a while. But it didn't even last me a year, I wouldn't pay this much for it, really not worth it. I guess you're lucky if it even lasts a year! Sorry to disappoint."
1,FAKE. PERIOD.,"This is NOT an authentic CHI. I'm pretty impressed with the extent they took to make it look real. I used this iron once, and my inexpensive Wal-Mart iron does a better job. Also, I was very suspicious by the packaging. One look at the instructions and I knew it was fake. There are so many grammar and spelling mistakes. SO I went through Misikko online and ordered the exact same CHI iron. It's amazing the difference, the packaging is much more professional and the product is the real thing. This is my first bad review to write on Amazon, and I'm very disappointed that they continue to sell these under false pretenses. I will be very guarded in the future, and reluctant to buy from Amazon."
1,Fragile CHI,It broke right away around November of last year What a way to entice us to buy 2-3x/year Can you please give us guidelines how to get it fixed so that we'll have other options than buying outright.
1,Broke after 4 mos.,"Ordered CHI on Aug 18. Liked it very much, smoothed my hair efficiently. Until it broke on Dec 6 (4 mos. later). Amazon would not accept full return after Sept 24 (1 month later). Only option was to send product back to them, postage at my expense, for a partial refund. Four mos. of use for a $60 product. Tremendously dissatisfied."
1,PRODUCT FAIL. Buyer beware.,"Wife bought this product based on the name brand. Said she always wanted one, had to be this name brand... well, she bought it, it worked for about 5 months and then died. Won't come on, heat up, nothing. So it ended up in the trash along with the money spent to purchase it. Buy a better rated product."
3,Works great,"Works great. They only think is the heating light doesn't stop blinking, even when it's super hot. Product works with no problems and shipping was fast."
1,"Disappointed, not what I thought","It was not the Chi I thought. Only has a on/off switch, not a temp dial like I have seen before. The LED light goes on and off, is not steady. Does not get as hot as I would like."
5,LOVE IT,"I love the CHI products...just don't love the salon prices. It's an amazing straightener. My only gripe is that you can't adjust the heat setting...but even on the ones where I've had that option, I've always had it cranked up to the highest setting!"
2,don't.,"i bought this chi straightener from amazon two weeks ago.. and it worked great! up until it broke today. there is no warranty for the iron when bought on amazon, so i'm out $50 and a straightener."
4,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,Love my new chi. I had trouble with it not working a couple of days after i received it. But i email the company and they took care of it right away i sent them the broken one and they sent me a new one. The new one works great!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent product,I love that chi Hair straightener. It gets hot very quickly and it straightens extremely well. I finish straightening my hair in about 5 to 10 minutes. The plates seem very durable and I've had it for about a year now and it looks like I just purchased it.
1,Knock off,"I read lots of reviews saying that this was a knock off but given the number of things I purchase from Amazon I had a hard time believing Amazon would be selling a knock off Chi. I had the ""real"" version prior to this of the exact same model so I was able to compare. They do look a LOT alike....but this one did not heat up hot enough so it obviously didn't do a good job AND my hair kept getting stuck in it WHICH has never happened with any real Chi that I've ever used. Also, my REAL one said made in USA whereas the fake one was made in Canada....there was actually French writing on the box which was my first tip off that something was off with it. There are also several other more subtle differences...but this is clearly a phony. I really hope Amazon stops selling this."
2,Does not seem to go on fully,"Great price, and got my Chi flat iron in a good amount of time, but the light seeems to go on and off, as if the product is not working fully. The product seemed to come pachaged, and works a bit - but not as well as my original Chi that was store bought."
1,BAD investment,"This straightener was faulty from the first day of use - it wouldn't stay on long enough to finish straightening. Pressing the re-set button only worked for a few minutes, and then it was back off again. I found out the warranty for the product was not worth anything if the product was purchased online. Good information to know - wish that information had been disclosed BEFORE purchase. So I went to an authorized dealer and bought an authentic Chi with a 4-year warranty that I can actually use if it breaks."
2,fake chi,"I think if a vendor is going to promise you a product then it needs to be the real thing. I received my Chi and when I opened it I knew it was a FAKE, having used a Chi before I now what the real thing looks like and what it is capable of doing.This was not it.I was very disappointed, being a first time buyer with Amazon Im afraid of buying any products with there vendors now because I don't know what Im going to get. And they where not very helpful with the return of the item. They don't even want the FAKE back!!!!"
2,WAS great,I have had my Chi for about a year now. And it worked wonders on my hair. I have really thick wavy hair and had a really cheap straightener that took me an hour just to do my hair. I was told about the Chi and of course went and bought it. Now a year later it just won't turn on. Sure i have dropped a few times but still. For paying over a $100 you would think it would last longer then a year!?! Now I am debating whether to buy a new one or not. By the way my mom has the same exact Chi and though she got her's a couple of months before I got mine she is having the same problem. If any of yall have any suggestions feel free to email me at Lilaggie2112@yahoo.com
1,"Reat when it works, but breaks easily","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She was thrilled. Unfortunately the straightener came out of the box broken. Amazon replaced it, but the replacement only lasted four months.So, buyer beware."
5,Never received it !!!,I never received this product!!! I have had this product before and I love it. Really upset it never was delivered. I guess I will have to buy one at the store.
5,Chi Iron,This iron will straighten your hair in seconds. It is awesome. I would just note that it gets super hot very fast and there is only one setting so you do have to be careful that the iron doesn't get too close to your face to avoid a burn. It doesn't seem to fry your hair like other irons and the straightening effect lasts all day and into the next day. It's really amazing and I would highly recommend it.
1,short circuit,when we plugged this in the red light kept going off and on then we heard crackling in the cord and had to unplug it. We never had a chance to see how it would work. The company was good about taking the item back and refunding.
4,Chi-Tastic!,"The Chi works great to straighten my hair. I have very fine hair, so it doesn't take much to straighten my hair. I can't really comment on how this would work on thicker or curly hair."
3,Great but not too sure,"My Chi got to me fairly quick. It works great for straightening and even curling. Heats up quick and is super hot, but takes a long time to fully cool. I read the reviews and became hesitant. After comparing to store displays after receiving, I think I might have a fake due to the material of the outside shell. Still, for the money, I am happy so far with what I got."
3,Expected better,"When we received the Chi it would not turn on. After several attempts it would eventually come on but it took a while. Once on, it worked great but it was a hassel getting it to work. The best part of the deal was the easy return of the product and how quickly Amazon sent us a new one that worked great! I will continue to shop with Amazon because of their excellent customer service."
1,It pulls my hair out,"All I have heard about the Chi is that is so wonderful, I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter. We received them 8 days after I ordered them. Mine pinches my hair and pulls it out. It is not a flat connecting ceramic surface. I am guessing it is defective. I did email the company that sent it to me (at the request of Amazon before I wrote this review - so they would have a chance to remedy the problem), I have not heard a word from the company. I owned a ceramic flat iron (different brand) and had no problems with it and it cost less than half of what I paid for the Chi. I am sure my Chi is the only one that does that since everyone else loves theirs. I am not happy that I spent that much money and bought it online where it is such a hassle to return/exchange. I have learned my lesson to never buy anything online."
3,TOOOOO Hot,"The straightening iron works well if you just want to straighten your hair period. But if you have fine hair like I do, the heat of the iron is entirely too powerful. Parts of my hair around my face have broken off because it is too hot for my hair. I tried using it to curl my hair, but again I couldn't do it quick enough to not singe my hair.Might be great for those with thicker hair!"
5,"Awesome product, fast shipment, overall great!",Thanks a ton! Fast shipment and what a deal! I look forward to buying more from you.Ashley
3,It doesn't always turn on,"I really like this straightener and it's the best I've ever used. It makes my hair very silky and it moves very quickly. However, my plug doesn't always turn on for some reason, so it's very unreliable."
5,wonderful,"I have used a variety of straighteners throughout my life but this one is the best by far! I even had my hair chemically straightened in the past and this does the same job! It's fast, makes my hair straight as a pin and lasts all day! If you are wanting a straightener that does a serious job, this is the one and yes it's worth every penny!"
1,broke in 4 less than 4 months!,"I bought a CHI because everyone said they were so good, but I went to do my hair, and it won't turn on. I have had it less than 4 months!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,I purchased this item about a month and a half ago. It worked great until yesterday when it just would not turn on anymore. I contacted the manufacturer and found out that they have NO authorized retailers of this product on the internet and therefore what I purchased may not even be an original CHI and would not fall under any warranty. I have now missed the return window with Amazon as well. I will be in contact with them to see if there is any way I can get my money back and I have hopes that they will work with me. But - don't waste your time or money with this!
1,Not satisfied,"I purchased this product because I previously had a CHI that lasted for 3 years. However, this CHI didn't last but 1 month."
1,Chi 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,"I ordered the hairstyling product through Amazon and in four days I received my shipment. When I first opened the package, everything seemed fine to me. The iron seemed in good condition. In my first use,I noticed that the light kept blinking.I straightened my hair with the iron, and it looked the same as if I had styled it with my Conair Iron. The second time I used it, the iron did not even turn on. It did not work anymore.I looked up Amazon's return policy and contacted them about my return. They were very friendly and helpful. I received a refund for my iron. Advice I have for others: DO NOT buy irons off the internet. You will not have a manufacturer's warranty. All you have is Amazon's warranty. In addition, if you want to return an item, you better do it quick! Amazon has a closing window for refunds. I hope this was somewhat helpful.-Jaydee"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!,"These are the worst flat irons ever. I thought I was purchasing the real CHI irons, but I was wrong. They make noise while plugged and it's just a waste of money. Please whatever you do STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT trust me!"
1,"Late shipment, defective product, NOT worth it...","This item was purchased on April 6, 2012- I paid extra for ""Second Day Delivery"". The item arrived ALMOST TWO WEEKS LATER!!!- I contacted the seller for a refund of the 2-day delivery costs: NO RESPONSE- I've used the item for 3 months and one of the heating elements has come loose. (My previous CHI lasted 10 years).- These items are sold ""Without Manufacturer's Warranty"", and only a 30-day Amazon warranty. I guess it's ""buyer beware"".- This is BY FAR the worst Amazon experience I've ever had, and the worst experience with a product- Stay away from this Seller(I couldn't select ZERO STARS!)"
2,Chi review,My girls are Chi experts and they did not like this Chi. They said it was a lesser quality and didn't do as good of a job as the salon purchased Chi. I bought another Chi from a salon. Bummer!
1,"Chi, don't buy it!","I bought several of these, I think it was 4 total. the 1st one broke in about 1 month and the 2nd broke in about 4 months. I'm not sure if the others are still working or if the people I gave them to are just too nice to tell me that they are junk!!"
1,Broke After One Month of Use,We had a bad experience. It broke and we didn't know how to get a refund. Can you help with this?
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!,"I loved my CHI! But when it broke four months after I had paid for it, I found out some bad news. The one year warranty is VOID if you buy it from Amazon, because they are not an authorized dealer!So now I have to buy a new one or pay to have mine fix, which will take from 3-5 WEEKS! Amazon really needs to tell their customers warranty is void when they buy it, because Amazon WILL NOT REPLACE IT!"
1,Fake,"Yes, I tried to return this product and they informed me that it was fake too. I bought a new one and compared it to the Internet one and they were different."
1,WARNING - WARRANTY VOID IF PURCHASED ONLINE,"I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year. The iron stopped working. I thought, ""Great! Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!"" After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet. This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron. DO NOT BUY!! WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn't even have a valid warranty!"
1,This is a FAKE item.,"This item was purchased in August and stopped working 4-months later. When the manufacturer was contacted regarding the 1-year warranty, we were asked to read the model number and country of origin. The Model GF1001 manufactured in the USA is a fake. Very disappointed in Amazon selling fake items. Buyer beware!"
1,You get what you pay for,I've had this since April and it burnt out in October as well as burnt my natural hair. I should have spend the money to get the real product because I messed my hair up trying to save money. Please read the reviews prior to buying this product if you don't want heat damage. I would not recommend this to my family or friends at all.
2,"I had this on my wish list, but removed it when I read the reviews","I did not buy this product. My old Chi, that is as ancient as can be, finally went kaputt and I needed a new one. I am a self-professed ""Amazon junkie"", so naturally I turned to the website to purchase my next Chi. After reading numerous(horror)reviews of fake Chis and chunks of hair burning from heads, I am going to stick to my local, reputable salon to get my new Chi. I have worked too hard to get these locks lookin' this way!"
1,this hair straightener+thick hair=bad hair day,I bought this straightener for my daughter and it is terrible. It takes almost 4 hours to straighten hair. It is so inconvenient. I wish I never bought it. It is a waste of money. It puffs your hair out.I personally hate this hair straightener. DON'T BUY IT! IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME!!!!!!!!!
1,Wasn't work great at first and now completely broken,"When it first arrived the light wouldn't stay lite consistently. I ignored the problem since it seemed to maintain its heat. After about 8 months the light only turned on every once and a while and it didn't maintain heat anymore. Then I started having to hit it in order to get it to turn on. Now it won't turn on at all. Yes this is cheaper than the ones in stores, but it isn't worth the headache or the replacement cost. There is no warranty on this product except for Amazon's 30 day period. I wouldn't buy it again. I suspect it is a knockoff version."
1,ONLY USED IT ONCE-DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE,"This is the worst expecience ever!!! I got this product and I was so happy because I was purchasing a CHI flat iron for an excellent price...BE CAREFUL!!! it's not original (it's FAROUK CHI). I received it and I tought it looked cheap, then I checked the reviews and I felt so dissapointed (you should read before getting the product :s). It only worked once,never turned on again!!! If you buy this product ""GOOD LUCK and say bye to your money""...By the way: you can get the real CHI at Walmart for $99 and you have 90 days to return it if you don't like it (it's really good)"
1,"bought in june 2012 came apart August 12, 2012 last one i bought just like this lasted 3 years",broke in 2 1/2 months last one just like this lasted three years. too late fo refund I am just out
2,No Warranty,"I like the chi, but it isn't the same model as the original chi. Accompanying warranty paper says that a one- yr warranty is only good if product is punched at a salon or retail store, NOT ONLINE! Amazon instructed me to contact the seller. I've written them twice over a 3-wk period and have gotten no response. Maybe it's a fake..."
1,It's ALREADY broken!!,I have had the straightener for barely four months now and it literally fell apart! I keep them in a case and am very careful when using and storing them because I know how expensive they are... I am so upset that I have to buy another straightener when I usually keep them for well over a year before having to replace! I would love a refund or a brand new product.. But I am not sure how likely that is! I will NOT be buying from this seller again!!!!!!
2,Not hot enough,"I have used the same Chi flatiron for more than 6 years. When it was time to get another flat iron I chose Chi again. Unfortunately, the one I received from amazon did not get nearly hot enough and wouldn't straighten my hair like the previous one I had."
2,Not as expected,"I expected this flat iron to work much better than it does (especially for the high price).The blades do not come together completely unless the handles are squeezed very tightly. If the blades are not touching, then the hair is pulled unequally causing some hair to get caught and pulled from the scalp. If you do squeeze the handles tightly to get the blades together, then the hair is pulled from the scalp. So either way it is pulling my hair out.Another issue I have with this model of flat iron is that there is no temperature control. I have thin hair and do not need the same blazing temperatures that someone with thick hair might need.I am having difficulty contacting the company to find out if I have a defective product or if this is a feature of this model."
2,NOT GOOD,"I have an iron obsession, and YES i loved the CHI when I first received it, but then it just stopped working. The cord wires wouldnt make contact inside the iron and i had to start holding the cord on a 45deg angle to get it to work... then that approach stopped working. I took the thing apart and fixed it, but then it happened again. So i bought another Chi. After about 3 months, the same thing happened with the cord. I didnt feel like taking it apart again, so I bought the Chi turbo - i was afraid to Stray from Chi, because I loved the results. And then after 3 months The Turbo stopped working.... 3 iron, all with the same problem... I'm done with Chi..."
1,Broke after three weeks of use.,I used this product for three weeks and the cord broke and the plastic holding it all together was unsalvageable. This was a complete waste of money and Chi doesn't guarantee the product because it was not bought from a salon. Next time I will spend the money to get the guarantee.
1,Not Satisfied,The problem is that I have actually had a Chi straightener before that was stolen so I decided to purchase this one online because of the price. It is not the same. It doesn't get nearly as hot as my original Chi. It just seems so cheaply made. It pulled my hair and did not work to straighten it. I was very unhappy and needless to say I had to purchase a new straightener.
4,Curly Mess No More,"I have all natural hair and wanted a change from all my curls and frizziness. As soon as I got the Chi, I plugged it in and realized there were no heat settings. I was a bit concerned, since I barely blow dry my hair, so this would be a bit more heat for me in almost a year. This straightener is the TRUTH. Literally, I had washed my hair that day and left it to air dry, and when I passed the straightener through some hair I took out of the bun, it took only one pass to get it straight. My hair is the thickest of thicks, and add on the curlies, I was truly amazed that the CHI worked so greatly. Definitely worth the price for me."
3,Not as expected,"I have long, thick, frizzy and curly hair which is not easy to straighten. I already have GHD hair straightener which is a very gr8 tool that i can't live without, I needed a second straightener coz i didn't want to move my GHD with me.I was looking for a cheaper alternative and after reading many good reviews about the CHI i decided to buy it.It gets the job done, but i really didn't like the build quality and its plastic feeling, the first time i used i was trying to get wavy hair so i rolled my hair around the straightener and the black color kinda faded out because my hair was hot when it touched the straightener's case.After using the straightener 2-3 times a week for about 6 weeks, it is starting to squeak when i use it.I wish i saved more money and bought another GHD.Thought to be fair, it straightens the hair very well, i guess it is a CHEAPER alternative after all :)"
1,Defective Chi and No response from Seller,I bought a brand new Chi from this seller a few months ago. I used the Chi a few times and one day I plugged it in and it wouldn't turn on. I paid $80 for about 5 uses. Clearly a defective product. Contacted the seller and got no response.
2,Great Product when i tworks...,"I have had this straightner for about a year but then it started turning on and off while I was using it depending on how I would turn in. Then it just quit turning on all together. My mom and two sisters have this same straightner and none of ours have lasted more than a year. We do use them very often, about everyother day; however, this product is very expensive and I expect to use it and it to last at least a couple of years. The product when it works is really great. Its the only straightner that makes my hair perfect."
5,great!,Came in the original box and worked awesome. If i ever need to buy another straightener I would purchase from here again!
3,not worth the price..,"**just to let everyone know, this is Gary's daughter, since i don't have my own account**anyways, i got this straightener as a gift about 2-3 years ago. At first, it wasn't too bad. It DID straighten my hair. But, since you cannot control the heat setting, it gets a little too hot, and dries out your hair. It was better than the cheap $20 ones you get at department stores, i'll give it that. But, it broke already, out of no where. I was planning on straightening my hair for the first day of school, but it broke the day before and had to get a cheap one. Thankfully, I'm getting a Solia, and hopefully this one will be a better investment.Pros:Ceramic plateslight weightmade hair softCons:very expensive (& the price isn't even worth it)gets TOO hottbreaks easilyThe chi was an okay straightener, but definitely not worth the money."
4,its good,its ok..it does its job but i dont like it that i can adjust the heat :( i like to have control...i think i would look into getting a different one that works more with my frizzy hair
3,QUIT WORKING,"I bought two of these, a couple of days apart, from different sellers. One of them just quit working, period. It worked fine up until it quit. The other one is still working fine. Amazon has a very good return policy, which included free UPS pickup of the package."
2,Chi Flat Iron,"I have used Chi's before, but this one is no where as good as ones I've used in the past. It does not get hot enough. I have a hard time getting my hair straight with it."
1,Warranty is void if bought from the internet (Don't buy from Shop Here),"Buyers beware: this product, when purchased from the internet, is void of warranty. It is clearly mentioned on the warranty notice you receive!I have purchased this item from ""Shop Here"", and as the warranty is not working from the manufacturer. After contacting the manufacturer, they told me that for online purchases, I would have to deal with the seller directly. I tried to contact Shop Here, but they are ignoring my emails. I would not buy from them if I were you, as if you happen to have a problem, they will ignore you.The product itself was good, while working, and I would have given a 4 stars if it had warranty."
1,Better off with a curling iron,"I heard so many good things about this product, so despite some poor reviews, I ordered it anyway. Every time I use it, it will turn off after about a minute. It cycles between on and off (the switch always stays on, but the light goes off), but it never gets hot. I find myself turning on my curling iron to use as a backup for when it goes off, and then decided I might as well just keep straightening my hair with my curling iron because at least it stays hot. I'm very disappointed I wasted my money on this product when it is not usable."
4,"Getting compliments, but missing some features I enjoy","I've had this straightener for about a month to six weeks, and every time I use it, I do get compliments on how smooth, shiny, and bright my blond hair looks. However, I do have a couple things I would consider next time I buy; there is not adjustment on the temperature, so for tough-to-straighten hair, that might mean using the tool over and over on the same section of hair in order to get the desired effect. Also, I do notice that I sometimes feel hairs catch on the side of the plates, which is something I've experienced with cheaper irons. I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the newness of the iron, or if the plates are not set as flush with the handle as I would like. But overall, I've been really happy with this flat iron, and if it lasts, would recommend it for people with moderately curly or wavy hair. It reduces hair frizz, and gives lots of shine!"
1,WARRANTY VOID,"I bought this item for a Christmas present and a little after three months the flat hairstyling iron stop working. Amazon fails to mention,however, that the warranty is void if purchased online from an unauthorized dealer. There really should be a statement somewhere in the advertisement about this warranty issue."
3,HMMM....,"While it worked (about 3 weeks) before it just stopped working on me, it did a quick job on flattening my hair. Me, personally, I don't like my hair so flat but for someone who wants flat hair quickly and not have to work so hard, this is a great iron."
1,Bad customer service - No Reply!,"From past experiences, I have discovered CHI products do not have the longest lifespan. That was proven true again with the Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron. This flat iron died after three months of use. The seller of the item, Velonex (Storefront currently unavailable) was totally unresponsive during communication over the last few weeks. I contact Amazon customer service, and they too were unable to receive a reply from Velonex. Amazon instructed me to contact the manufacturer, which I did... only to hear they do not offer warranties on products purchased over the internet!Stuck with a broken product and no reply from Velonex customer service!Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron"
1,Short life,"I purchased this flat iron in November and it no longer worked as of the end of December. Up until that point, it was great. The seller will not respond to my emails for a refund either. Big disappointment."
1,FAKE CHI FLAT IRON,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!! I PURCHASED WHAT I THOUGHTWAS A CHI FLAT IRON AND WHEN I TRIED TO GET IT REPAIRED OR REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, I GOT NO RESPONSE FRON NATELLA AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. I THEN RETURNED IT TO THE MANUFACTURER WHO RETURNED IT TO ME AND TOLD ME IT WAS NOT AN AUTHENTIC CHI!!! I HAVE NO WAY TO GET IT FIXED AND NO WAY TO GET MY MONEY BACK FROM THE SELLER,"
1,Broke after 6 months....no warranty,I liked the Chi until I realized that there was not a warranty on it when it stopped working 6 months later. do not buy this from Amazon.
5,CHi flat iron,My daughter purchased a Chi several years ago and loved it so I decided it was time to buy one of my own. The first thing that I noticed is that it heats up amazingly fast so I can decide to use it last minute in the morning and still not be late for work. It works much better than the $25 hair straighteners because it doesn't get to hot and cause damage to my hair.
4,"Works fine, however, has to be used with extra stuff","The product is very good, however, I have taken a star away as this has to be used with a lot of other accesories like the gel, etc, to prevent your health of your hair and also it does get hot on the sides, which means I am not able to use with my kids being around."
2,It will break...,"I am writing this review in response to Faruuks poor customer service and flawed product. This a GREAT product until... it breaks and it will. Lasted about 14 months (2 months past warranty of course) and then the On / Off switch broke... Googled the issue and it seems that tons of people have had this issue. In fact there is a you tube video on how to fix it. I called Faruuk to see if they would sell me or provide an on off switch so I could fix it and they wont and cant help.So in short - great product, be prepared for it to break and you wont get any help to fix a .05 cent broken switch."
3,Not worth the $,"I purchased this thinking that it would be a lot more quality than my $15 flat iron that I already had. Needless to say, I am not impressed by this one. It doesn't have heat settings and it doesn't slide smoothly. I wish I could return it."
1,Buy it direct and get the warranty!,"I bought this flat iron for my daughter in July. After a little more than three months of use (more than 90 days - of course!), the cord developed a short and wouldn't heat consistently...it would go on and off. Eventually, a hole burned through the cord. I will also add that my daughter was always very careful to not wrap the cord. This was not the result of user error. I was aware of the fact that the 1 year warranty would be void if I purchased on Amazon, but I had heard such great things about the Chi brand that I wasn't particularly worried about it. I should have been. I was politely told that 90 days had passed since my purchase and I had no recourse. $65 down the drain. The next flat iron will be bought through the proper channels so that the warranty will be in place. Most likely going to look at other brands as the Chi did not live up to my expectations."
2,Just don't make them like they used to,"I purchased this Chi for my daughter having owned my own Chi for eight years. This new version is a sorry replica of the original. It is half the weight of the older version making it more challenging to vary pressure while running the length of the hair. The construction is also poor with gaps between the cermamic plates and wand which catch and break hair. It feels like a knock-off and, considering the price of the new one was half of the old, that may be the case."
1,Worked for 2 months,"After my daughter had her original CHI for years and loved it, so when it broke I replaced it with this 'CHI'. This iron didn't last 2 months. I knew it was half the price of the original CHI she owned, but I figured it would get her through a year at least. It is either a knock-off and a very poor quality CHI. I do not recommend it."
2,waste of money,"I recently purchased my fourth CHI. I went through three of them when I was in high school between 2003 and 2007. After my third I bought a TIGI hardcore. That lasted for about 4 years before it even broke. I decided to replace my TIGI with another CHI. Biggest mistake ever. I dont know if CHIs just got worse in that time frame or if my age plays a factor but this straigtener sucks. half of my bangs are ripped out because of its tough grip. Overall it seems to straighten like a cheap straightener you would get for $30, not like the $100+ it costs. Save your money and do your research. Stongly recommend against a CHI, especially if your hair is naturally curly or frizzy."
2,STOPPED WORKING!!,"Normally the products I buy through Amazon are relaiable and function properly, unfortunately the Farouk CHI Iron stopped working after 6 months!! I have no idea why!! chocking ..."
3,Doesn't get hot enough,"I've owned many flat irons and this one does not get as hot as others that I've had. I can actually touch my hair as soon as I'm done running the iron over it. Because it doesn't get as hot, it takes longer to straighten my hair...I have to go over the section at least 4 times. Very time consuming!"
4,Awesome product!,"This is an awesome flat iron. I have used mine over 3 years and only had to send it in once to get it fixed, because the wall plug in stopped working. Their customer service is amazing and fixed my iron at NO COST! I would highly recommend this iron to anyone who needs something to flat iron their hair every day or on a regular basis!"
2,"Decent results, but short lifespan","I was pretty thrilled with the CHI to begin with. It was my first high-end flat iron, and it did the trick (that is, it straightened my hair without needing more than a few run-throughs on each section of hair, thereby causing less damage). I used it about three times a week, took excellent care of it, and barely even moved it around my apartment. After four months of this light/moderate use, it just stopped working. The reset button doesn't hold, which leads me to believe that the circuit just shorted out. To me, even Amazon's lowered price is not worth a product that may only last a few months. Farouk will ""fix or replace"" your broken CHI for a $35 money order and will take about 5 weeks to do so... but if this situation doesn't sound great to you, I'd recommend overlooking the hype of the CHI straightener and looking into other brands such as GHD and Sedu."
4,great product,"Great product, heat up in seconds. I have naturally curly hair and it usually takes forever to straighten it but with this straightener I can do it in 10-15 minutes easily. I does not have a temperature dial which I have seen on other straighteners but I have been very happy with this product."
2,Won't last more than a year.,"I have had two Chi flat irons. Neither one lasted more than a year. They work great when they work, but I won't be buying another one."
1,"Great, if you like cheap knockoffs","I borrowed my sister-in-law's CHI straightener when she came to visit and loved it! I had never felt my hair so smooth, and I was instantly impressed. So I bought this one on amazon, congratulating myself on finding one that was about $60 cheaper than what my sister paid. Terrible mistake. I should have read the reviews instead of just going off of how many stars it had gotten. It is a knockoff of the real CHI straightener in the same packaging. The real CHI is much heavier and sturdier. It glides over your hair making it straight in one pass, while this one painfully catches your hair and needs two or three passes to straighten. Spend the money on a real one from a beauty store! You won't regret it."
4,Works great,The Flat Iron works great. I have really coarse hair with natural wave to it. It really cuts down on the time it used to take me to straighten my hair.
3,It's nice but.... no heat setting,Its nice but I have fine hair that has been relaxed and this things get so hot that I can actually hair my hair sizzle. I returned after using it about three times and my HAIR not the iron left a burn mark on my middle finger. The Thing bout this model is that it has no heat settings and gets way too hot for my fine processed hair. Some people with unruly hair needs hot but this one just wasn't for me. It did the job but I didn't want to add any more damage to my hair.
4,Works well,Its a good buy. I have had no problems with it. Your hair will get smoothly straightened with no frizzes. My only complaint is that this model does not have a gauge/settings.
1,It is a fake do not buy. Pay the extra money and buy the real thing,Recently ordered CHI from this company and when I received the CHI I soon realised it was a fake. I have a CHI prior to purchasing this one and love it. Had it for three years until it died on me.The one I purchased looks the same but take 3x longer to heat up and have to go through my hair 3 and 4 times before it is straight.This company is a rip off.
1,It's a Fake.,"When I bought this, I thought I'd be getting a good deal on a REAL Chi, because my REAL Chi broke after 3 years.But this one works just as well as the drugstore ones.It takes forever to heat up, it doesn't even get that hot, and the Chi words are coming off on both sides, as well as the ""Global Beauty"" words.DON'T BUY. Just spend a little more money on the real deal."
2,"Loved it at first, then it stopped working!","I purchased my CHI at the beginning of the summer. It worked very well while it was operational. After 4 months it began to short out. The power light would be on, it would heat up, and then the light would go off. After a while, the light no longer came on.Like other people's reviews, I tried to contact Farouk, but they were non-responsive to messages... or even picking up the phone. So, I too returned it to Amazon and had a restocking fee deducted from my $$ back."
5,MAGIC!,"After my Sedu broke (which was pretty good) I had to go back to my backup Remington... until this beauty came in the mail. Having had to use my cheap metal-plated Remington, I am especially appreciative of the Chi. Now I get why the Chi is THE brand salons use. It made my hair salon-perfect in less than 5 minutes.I haven't had my hair this perfectly straight ever before except when having my hair done at a salon (probably with a Chi). I had gotten used to my hair being ""acceptably straightened"" using my other straighteners and given up on having salon pin-straight hair. I am so psyched I got this product for such an amazing price and that it works so well.I don't care if the warranty is void. For $56 I'll just get a new one if/when this one stops working. I love it!"
3,Hmm,"Got my chi in a reasonable amount of time and everything seemed fine. I've had it for about 5 months and I was very happy, but recently one of the straightener plates came unglued. I've been pressing the plate back in and crossing my fingers hoping that it stays in place long enough for me to finish my hair. I'm a little disappointed since I grew up sharing a Chi with my mother and sister which had been dropped multiple times, stepped on, and worked flawlessly."
1,NOT CERTIFIED CHI NOT A LISCENCED CHI DEALER,My girls hair now smells burnt got her it for christmas a bad decision. Her hair is getting a little brittle due to chi. She going to get a chi from an authorized chi dealer a salon avoid this dealer discontjungle. Trying to get a refund as we speak.
1,Stopped working after a week,"I have always liked the Chi flat iron. My last Chi flat iron stopped working due to a short in it. It would only work if I held the iron a certain way. So I ordered a new one and I had only had it a week and it stopped working. I have to say that I am really disappointed in Chi. However, I was very happy with the way Amazon handled my return. Thanks Amazon. :)"
2,Over Priced,"For the price, the quality of this Chi product is not what I expected. The hardware is cheap looking and feeling. So far the product works just fine. I just hope I don't need to replace it after 6 months."
3,Not Satisfied with CHI iron,"I've purchased other CHI irons through Amazon before but the quality of the one I recently received was substandard. It pulls my hair, which I've never encountered with CHI before, only with lower quality irons and it seems like it takes longer and I don't get the desired effect."
1,Broke after 3 months!,"I received this item in mid-September, and over the Thanksgiving holiday it just stopped working -- I used it, unplugged it, and went back about 15 minutes later to touch a spot up and it was totally dead. I wish I'd taken the time to look at these reviews before I bought it -- I didn't even realize counterfeits were something to be concerned about. I have no idea if this one was or was not, but after contacting Farouk they informed me that the warranty isn't valid if I bought it from a non-authorized seller and most of the ""Chi"" products sold online are fakes. I totally agree with an earlier review...it's not worth saving $20 on this iron when there's no warranty to cover it if it breaks -- in my case, after less than 3 months!"
4,Great Price,"Replaced one like it that was completely worn out. Shipping was great and a great Price. When she wears out the next one, we'll be back."
3,too expensive,"this product broke after 3 months. Not worth the price paid, besides putting a hot iron to your hair really does dry it out."
4,"Pricy, don't use much",The product is good - but for me - it takes really long! So I use it a lot less thank I expected. Costco does have this now for a much better price.
1,Great Straightener bu not from Amazon,I purchased my Chi from Amazon just 3 months ago. It worked great until today when it wouldn't turn on. I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers that said this happened to them. Now I'm going to go to Trade Secret and buy one for $129.99 with a LIFETIME guarantee (with reciept & box). Amazon's 30 day return/exchange policy does not say much about the quality of the products they sell.
2,"More ""Bads"" than ""Goods""","Goods: it gets hot and does the job. Bads: NO WARRANTY unless it's purchased through a salon, NO thermostat (it's just on or off), WHIMPY cord, as a result, directions indicate that the cord CANNOT be wound around the device to store it, so now I have a tangled mess to deal with every time I use it. This is NOT a good value for the price - way more ""BADS"" than ""GOODS"". It doesn't work any better than the $30 irons I've had in the past."
1,Stay away from this product!,"I bought this flat iron as a gift for my girlfriend. She has thick wavy hair and usually flat irons her hair. The iron stopped working after one use. It seemed like the unit was not getting any power. This is not the quality one expects from such an expensive product. The manufacturer does not provide any warranty if the flat iron is bought online, but I am glad I was able to return it to Amazon."
4,Good straightner,"I do like this straightner because it's a lot faster to use than my wet-2-straight iron, but the result is the same. To be honest, I haven't seen where it's THAT much better. I actually do like the fact that it only has one setting making for less confusion, and I have terribly thick hair, so I would have to have the highest level anyway. I guess it would work wonders on someone with average hair, or maybe I need more practice with it, but for now, I only like it, not love it. I CERTAINLY wouldn't have bought it from a salon at their high price though, and if I something happens to this one, I might consider getting another brand."
2,IMPORTANT WARRANTY INFO,JUST A HEADS UP TO EVERYONE ON FAROUK CHI. THEY WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY IF YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS FROM A LICENSED BEAUTY SALON. I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY!
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,This iron is not worth the money -first I am angry that I selected the FREE shipping - 5-7 days turned out to be 14 days -second - the plates on the flat iron do not line up - there is a gap which my hair slides through unless I put allot of hair between the plates - the iron looks cheap - doesn't have a heat control dial - and just not worth the money -I will be returning this product.
5,Love my CHI,I LOVE my CHI! The one I had for 7 years of almost daily use just broke last night and I felt like I had lost my best friend. I will be ordering another one as I can't imagine living without it!
2,Upset,"Not that great, the iron does not get hot enough. About an hour later my hair gets fizzy . I thought since it was a chi it should work great,"
5,5 star seller!!!,High quality product. Prompt Shipping. Delivered new in original packaging. I've had the product for 4 months and it still works perfectly. I was so pleased with the quality and the price that I bought another for my sister.
1,This is a KNOCKOFF,"This is NOT a real CHI Flat Iron. Is did not come with product registration, and it did not perform as well as a real CHI would. Amazon was great when I complained and sent me a new unit (Amazon thought the unit was defective although my e-mail to them specified that I believed they sent me a cheap knockoff)."
1,"Great Product, Until it Dies","I would be giving this product four or five stars, if it didn't die on me today, mid-styling session. I received it four months ago and it is already completely dead. I expected more from this product."
2,Chi pulls my hair,"This is a great tool, but it pulls my hair. The Chi my daughter bought elsewhere does not pull my hair. Don't understand why this one does."
4,Its worth the money!,This iron heats up really quickly. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny and gets out all the frizz. I iron my hair every morning now and it only takes me 5 mins... its one of the best purchases i ever made.
4,Great Chi,"I really enjoy using this product. My hairstylist uses the Chi Iron, for styling curls or straight and I love the way my hair looks. So I purchased the item to keep up my look and it works very well! I even use it on my daughter who has very kinky, curly hair & it gets it very straight and easy to manage."
4,Great Flat Iron!,"I love this flat iron! My only gripe is that it doesn't automatically turn off after so much time. There have been numerous occasions when I've forgotten to turn it off, and it has sat on all day."
3,It's OK,"I have thick hair. This product is OK, but I'm not overly impressed. I've tried others and this is definitely better than products you would find at Wal-mart or the grocery store and the price isn't too bad. I feel like it takes forever to straighten my hair with this and it's still not as flat/unfrizzy as I would like it to be. Oh well, it will work for now."
2,What a mess!,The product was received in a timely fashion. It worked great 3 times. The fourth time the ceramic pads fell out of the iron and it has not worked since. we popped the pads back into place but now there is no consistent temperature and the pads feel unstable.The return policy support is nonexistent. BUYER BEWARE!!!
3,Shoddy Quality,"This product worked once. After it's one time usage, it decides when it wants to come on. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. If it worked all the time, it would be great, but it doesn't!"
3,works! but if you're not careful it will burn your hair!,even with care my hair gets lighter and drys out with too much use....so I haven't used it too many times in the the 3 years I've had it.....never had probs with it breaking but I don't use it very often. would not buy it again....i prefer to use the straightening blowdryer by conair.
1,Worst purchase experience!,"I got this as a gift and used it maybe 3 times. It did not straighten my hair nearly as well as my inexpensive Hot Tools ceramic flat iron. So I stopped using it. However, after my hair started drying out and breaking, I figured I'd give it another shot because it could be the cheap flat iron that was giving me problems. The CHI would not turn back on. Used it 3 times. Stopped working completely. What a complete and utter waste of money. And it was purchased on Amazon of course so the warranty was null and void. I am SO disappointed in this product. I had been given so many personal recommendations for it too... I don't understand why it was so awful for me when everyone else seems so happy with theirs."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,"I purchased this item to replace my Solano Sapphire, a flat iron that I had used for 6 years. I used the Chi once, and it burnt my hair straight off my head. I figured that I maybe just pre-heated too much, but, when I went to use it a second time, it wouldn't turn on. It was broken. As a result, I would not recommend this flat iron to ANYONE."
5,The perfect iron!,"I have owned this product for nearly two years and I still love it! It was exactly what I was looking for. It heats up so quickly and I can get my hair as straight as I want it in no time and I've never had a problem with damage, even with daily use. I love that I can also use it to curl my hair by placing the hair section in the iron, flipping the iron upward, and gliding down as normal (instructional videos are available on YouTube). It makes my hair look great every time and I always get complements! This is a must-have!"
2,Don't buy from No-Curls!,"Chi Flat Irons are great - if they are the real thing. Not sure about the ones that No-Curls sells - the ones that I bought were awful. Perhaps they were factory seconds and I got bads ones. The seller did not give me a full refund, I was charged a restocking fee for returning a damaged item. The seller was so upset by my first review that he sent me an email offering the full refund if I would remove the comment. This is VERY telling. Buyer beware, the irons are a great price - if they don't rip out your hair; if they do and you return them, you'll be out a bunch for shipping both ways (not refunded) and the fee for returning. In the long run, it would probably pay to buy from a more reputable seller. But again, Chi Flat Irons are great - just watch who you buy from."
4,Best hair straightener!,"This is the same straightener my salon uses, and it works great!The larger CHI product does NOT work as well, and this one used to come with different heat settings (now it has one).But it still works wonderfully, and it leaves hair shiny and straight.It doesn't damage your hair like some cheaper models do.Great investment for anyone looking!"
5,Chi,My daughter wanted this for Christmas. We have a budget and was not sure I was able to get it for her. Not only was it available within our budget it was way under budget. Loved this CHI and would buy again. Shipping was super fast also.
1,BREAKS DOWN EASILY,My sister and I have only used it less than 20 times and one of the ceramic plates already came loose. It feels very cheap. The stuff that was holding the plate together was melting and a weird smell came out. We want to return it.
2,"Eh, not so great",Maybe it's just ours. We've only had this for about 1.5 months. My wife is the one that uses it. It's already stopped working. :( It simply won't turn on anymore. No combination of resetting the breaker or flipping the switch will do anything. So we're basically out $60.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought my wife a hair straightener for our 16th wedding anniversary. She used is 4 times in the 60 days we have owned it it's dead as a door nail. No power. No help from the vendor due to 30 day warranty. No response from Amazon when I contacted them for help. Not good. Back to Overstock.com where I don't lose my money if the product is a lemon!! I couldn't rate ZERO Stars, so I had to give it one by default."
1,Must be a fake!,"I have heard a lot of good things about CHI straightening irons. I was worried that getting a CHI for $60 may be too good to be true. Now that I've been using this iron for three weeks, I am sorely disappointed.Pros:-Makes my hair feel pretty soft afterwards.Cons:-Even when the light is on indicating the iron is on, the iron hasn't heated up. I have to turn it on and off. This is a common problem that started on day one.-The iron doesn't get very hot-I have wavy hair, but expect to not go over a section of hair with the iron more than once. With this iron, I have to go over a section two or three times.Overall review:I am going to return this iron because it does not meet the expectations I had of a CHI (deal or no deal!). This particular iron was priced at $120-$150 on other sites, so if it were genuine, I'm sure the product would have performed well."
2,Didn't last but a month!,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she liked the way it was on her hair. BUT, this thing went dead a month later for no reason at all! Since I bought this from amazon and not from an authorized ""Brick and Mortor"" store then the warranty is not valid."
1,Very disappointed,"This was a gift and I am sad to say that I am very disappointed. From the moment it arrived in the mail, I was perplexed as it did not look like other Chi flat irons that I have purchased however, I wanted to give it a chance. After just 7 uses it no longer works. It does not turn on at all. I am a regular customer of Amazon and cannot remember ever having an issue with a product being so terrible. I'm not sure that I would purchase electronics again from Amazon due to this expensive loss as I now have to purchase another flat iron after such a short period of time."
2,Not an authentic CHI flatiron as advertised,"I purchased what was supposed to be a CHI flat iron on Oct 1, 2011. It slowly started getting build up on the ceramic plates, until now the plates are full of build up. I have tried to clean the plates, but am unable to get the build up off. I put a flat iron protectant spray in my hair before styling, but it should not cause this. It never did on my previous CHI flat iron. Previously,I had a CHI flat iron for about 5 years and loved it. I never had this problem with it, but the electrical switch broke, so I had to replace it. This is definitely not an authentic CHI. I had one previously and have never experienced anything like this."
5,The Chi Rocks!,"This flat iron rocks. It heats up in a matter of minutes, it's easy to handle and does not burn the hair. I highly recommend this product."
3,Two weeks and quit working?????,"I really liked the flat iron when it worked, then one morning I plugged it in and nothing, very dissapointing for something so expensive. Now I have to try to find my receip and send it back and I had to by another flat iron."
4,CHI Review,I bought the Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron.LOVE IT! I have waste length hair and use it often. I bought a second one for my daughter who has a curly perm and likes to wear it straight for variety. We both are well satisfied with our CHI. It straightens without burning or scorching. Leaves hair soft and shinny. I would recommend it for any hair type or style.
2,Arrived opened and unoperable,"This product arrived in a very timely manner, and Amazon handled my refund promptly and without an issue. And that is all I can say that is positive. After reading many reviews, I decided to give this flat iron a shot. I have been using a much cheaper Conair that was just worn out after a 1 1/2 years of use. I honestly cannot say anything about the product itself because I never got the chance to try it. When the flat iron arrived, the shipping box was fine. However, I discovered the actual box to the flat iron was not sealed and looked to have been previously opened/returned. There was no owner's manual, just a flyer warning against electric shock. The plug had a rattling noise and after trying in EVERY outlet in my house, the flat iron would not turn on or heat up. I returned the product for a refund instead of an exchange and have since asked for a Babyliss Nano Titanium (what my hairdresser uses on my hair) as a Christmas gift."
1,Defective Chi,"This is my second Chi...I ordered the same exact one I had before because my first one was great. It just died when I was overseas and plugged it into a converter. This Chi, on the other hand, is horrible. I use very little product on my hair, but after every use, there is tons of build up on the Chi and I have to continually clean/scrub it or else it won't really work. I am extremely disappointed. If you are going to order a Chi, please don't do it through this vendor as they sell sub-par products. Now, I'm out the money and still need to get a decent flat iron."
2,not made like they used to be,"This CHI lasted less than a year. Farouk will not take back products purchased online, so.... Do not buy your CHI from Amazon unless you think that 80 bucks for a years worth of straight hair is a good deal. I do not think it is."
1,JUNK!,"My husband got me this iron for Christmas. It worked about 2 times, after it failed to turn on, I contacted CHI...I had only had it 1 month. They do not honor the warranty for any internet purchases including AMAZON.Needless to say I was quite shocked and upset. Amazon is replacing it, but I fear I have no warrenty going forward. I don't recommend this item at all.Buy another brand!!!"
1,broke in 1 week,"i let straightener sit for 5 minutes without watching, next thing you know the ceramic plates stated melting off. what a waste! i ended up buying a new straighter the next week that has not broke yet. FYI. if you buy this straighter, don't let it sit without watching it."
4,CHI Flat iron,I made this purchase to replace an identical CHI flat iron that I had purchased at my hair salon last year. That iron cost me over $140.00 whereas the flat iron I purchased through Amazon cost well under a $100.00. I'm very satisfied with this product I had to replace my original iron due to heavy use and numerous drops on the tile floor. The iron does a nice job of straightening hair.
2,Lasted only 3 months,I purchased from Ulta for $129.99 and it broke after 3 months. I'm purchasing my second one from Amazon at a lower price - hope this one does not break.Besides that I loved the flat iron when it worked.
3,"Great product, but broke quickly","I loved using the CHI, and it worked wonderfully on my thick hair, but it stopped working after 6 months of light to moderate use! My previous straightener lasted 2-3 years, and at 1/4 of the price of the CHI. While the quality of this product is far superior to any others I've used, I would not purchase again."
1,Very Unsatisfied,"I am extremely unhappy with this flat iron. It worked well while it worked, but it only worked for approx. 3 months. I expected so much more because I know several people who have them, and they say CHI is the best. I'm starting to wonder. I only had a month to return it from Amazon, so I can't even do that. Very unhappy with this iron & wouldn't recommend buying it from this site. Buy it somewhere that has a better return policy."
3,Love the Chi Brand. New flat iron came broken. No response from seller.,"I have ordered hundreds of things on Amazon and Ebay. I have never had a problem with a seller contacting me after I have informed them of a broken item. As of yet, I still have not heard from the seller. The item came with the on/off switch broken. Would love to work with the seller to correct problem."
5,A Guaranteed Perfect Hair Day!,I have very long hair (a little below my chest) and have been using a similar low-priced revlon flat iron from walmart for a long time. I used my friends CHI at a youth conference a few months ago and fell in love! When I went back to my cheap walmart flat iron it just wasn't the same. Once you go Chi you can't go back! Anyways Amazon had the best price by far and now my hair looks AMAZING. Shiny silky smooth and it seriously looks like I belong in a shampoo commercial. aw I am so happy! :)
1,Don't Bother,"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! I purchased this hair straightener for my teenage daughter and it only lasted 2 months. After having the item replaced, the second one lasted 1 month. It is definitely an inferior product (probably made in China). I will never purchase a CHI hair straightener again. Go with a German brand instead."
1,dissatisfactory,"Very unhappy with the product, returned the first one-defective (test/reset button wouldn't work), received replacement--also defective (""On"" light wouldn't come on)."
3,Ok,"I guess this is okay. It was the first flat iron I bought so I don't have much to go on. It didn't seem to really work that great for my hair, though."
3,It's good..,The Hair straightner that I bought was very good as per my wife.What about the warrenty?Thanks.Kamrul
4,Good deal,"I purchased the exact same model at a local salon for over $160! After about 5 years something went wrong with the heating system (possibly because I left it on for over 12 hours one day while in a HUGE rush! yikes!) The warranty was out but I was being cheap so I bought one on amazon for $80. Works just as well as the last, although I noticed that sometimes it doesn't glide as well when straightening and smoothing as the original I purchased at the salon. The only other thing I noticed was it did not make my hair as shiny as the other. In terms of ""flat iron"" and straightening it works miracles!!!"
3,Unresponsive Supplier - Amended,"I ordered this product and received it without any problems. I used it for a couple of weeks and it stopped working, but when I emailed the supplier about exchanging it, I never heard anything back. I emailed again and still haven't heard anything. I will go ahead and send it back, since I have nothing to lose anyway, and I will change this review if I get a positive response from them. NEW - I received a refund from Amazon and will look somewhere else for a replacement."
2,not for coarse hair!!!,"I have had many inexpensive flatirons over the past few years and kept hearing raves about this one. I finally splurged on a birthday present for myself and I wish I had saved my money. I will start by saying that I am caucasian but I have very coarse, thick, wavy hair. I can get my hair straight with this but it takes more time(I have to go over and over each section and do smaller sections at a time) than my less expensive one... So I have gone back to useing it. I do still use the CHI for touch ups since it does heat up very fast."
2,Not impressed.....,"Chi products have been recommended to me by several people, so I decided to upgrade my ""cheap"" hair straightener. I must say, I think this product is overrated. Expensive doesn't mean better. The ceramic plates don't seem to grab the hair. It sort of glides over the hair too easily. Went back to my cheap straightener. Not recommended"
4,"Great Product, don't take it overseas, and don't buy online!","My chi is about 2 months old and I do love it. It is much hotter than my conair straightener, a lot smoother, and it works very quickly. A few pointers, though.1) Don't buy it online, you need the warranty protection and you cannot get that online. Buy it from a real store.2) Don't take it overseas. Even when using the proper power converter, mine stopped working after a few minutes. Luckily, I had purchased it from a real store and was able to exchange it under warranty."
2,"Works for a while, breaks and apparently not under warranty","OK, I haven't checked for sure about the warranty but it's over a year old anyway. It worked fine for a few months, then started playing up (wouldn't turn on unless I repeatedly hit the reset button). Then gave up the ghost totally. I'm going to get some GHD ones - they're better and more reliable, although quite a bit pricier. Too risky to try these again, though!"
2,Not that impressed,Purchased this because of all the great reviews. Not impressed with it at all. My less expensive one (which cost about half of what this did) works better. Not sure I will be keeping it.
1,Not worth your money,"I bought this hair straightener in July 2008. It stopped working in August 2009. It worked well while it was still functional, but I can't afford to buy a new one every year. I remember the day it broke. I left it on for 30 minutes. That was the end of it."
2,disappointed,"For the price I paid and reviews and brand I expectedsoo much better. It is better than my original huge old school one BUTthis is just as damaging and takes forever, you have to go over and over and i still wasn't satisfied with the results for the price I paidI would have returned it if I straightened more often but it was too late...Way over priced just too damaging for your hairnow im affraid to even try another for fear of damaging my hairand it is quite wavy/curly but not tight curlssooo disappointed"
3,Packaging Made it Look Used,"This CHI flat iron came in a damaged box and this made it look like it was a used product, even though it was advertised as being new. It was a gift so I was a little embarrassed with the appearance of the box but had no time to exchange it. The product itself seemed to be new."
3,Took to long to ship,"The price is excellent, but very disappointed in the time it took to arrive after processing, especially a small item as the Chi."
3,Chi............ :( was okay,The Chi... well what can I say was okay.. I was hoping it was better its not all that what I thought it was..
2,Worked OK for awhile but gets worse with time,"Only worked okay from the start. I had a different Chi before this, which worked wonderfully. I only replaced because that one will no longer shut off unless unplugged (but still gets about twice as hot as this one). I've had this one more than a year now, and it gets worse every month. It doesn't get as hot as it should and only does a mediocre job straightening my hair."
1,Buyer beware,"I thought I was buying a genuine CHI product. Not only has the CHI label worn off, but so has the ceramic on the flat iron. Originally it seemed to work wonderful, then as time went on, the ceramic plates looked different than my daughters who had bought CHI products, but they purchased from a different source. I realized to my great dismay, that the ceramic plates are only coated and very thinly! The on off button does not always function just adding to the whole negative. I now have to resort to my old Conair one and am so disappointed in this purchase. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone and also warn, buyer beware. Very sorry to have invested the money in this and now am not able to use it at all."
5,"Another Item Off The Wish List, Thanks To Amazon!","I was glad to find this name brand Hair Straightener available here on Amazon. Surprisingly at a FAR lower price than regular retail. I ALWAYS go to Amazon.com first, when I'm looking for a great deal!"
3,This is not a real Chi,"This is not a real Chi flat iron and does not come with a warranty. The swivel cord is very awkward and hard to work around. It does get hot quickly like the real Chi but because it is fake I'm not sure if the plates are real ceramic and cause less harm to the hair. It did come extremely quickly however, in like two days."
5,excellent straightener,"This straightener works really well and heats up super quickly. I had an older version which started to turn off at times (probably due to dropping on the ground a few times), so hopefully it won't happen again. I would recommend storing it in the bubble wrap it comes in or buying a case to prtect it from hitting the floor, etc. This is a great deal for this product too."
5,The Chi is Popular for a Reason,"i just bought the chi and Im in love with it. The flat iron really does work like it should. the only this that I noticed is that you need a few things when you use it.1. A comb to brush out the small piece of hair you are going to straighten.2. A heat protector spray because this iron is as hot as it gets for your hair.3. A shine moisturizer serum, because without it the hair gets a little puffy because it becomes extremely dried out from the heat.with all that you will get super slick, flat straight hair that looks wonderful. and the chi works really fast unlike other irons.By the way make sure you give it like 5 minutes to really heat up because it works amazingly well at its hottestENJOY!"
3,Pulls hair but otherwise ok,"A little disappointed in this straightener. I expected more from CHI since everyone I know says they are so amazing. It does a decent job straightening my naturally wavy hair, but it snags in the corners and pulls some out! Ouch!"
1,GRAY MARKET AND NO WARRANTY,"My daughter loves the iron but the GFCI switch on the plug won't stay clicked. This means the iron won't work and is useless.Now I find Amazon is selling gray market products with no manufacturer's warranty. Come on Amazon, I expect better than selling products with no warranty. I expect warranty issues from the fly-by-night vendors on the internet, but not Amazon. Do the right thing and look after your customers."
4,Wonderful product - caution to those with fine hair,"I was shocked to see how well this product worked on my curly, thin hair. No matter what I did in the past, if my hair was exposed to humidity it would curl and frizz up. When I use the Farouk CHI iron, my hair stays straight all day long - and mostly frizz free.I'd like to caution those with thin hair. Although I use a 'heat protective spray' before i use the flat iron, I've noticed more hair falling out than usual. I can't use this product everyday. At least if I go bald, the few strands that are left will be nice and straight. :)"
5,Great product!,"I bought this for my niece's birthday and she loves it! The price was the best I could find - great product, price, and shipping!"
2,Broken or imposter CHI,"I was very excited to recieve my CHI straightner which I had heard so much about. When I recieved it promptly in the mail, I plugged it in and it would not turn on. Also the red bulb for the on indicator light was missing. So I never got to try it. When I returned it, I was told that the seller did not have a replacement. The item was a bit flimsy and I am wondering if it might have been an imposter. I am sorry I didn't get to try a ""CHI"""
2,item replaced afer six months,"this was the hairstyling iron my 17 yr old daughter had to have. it worked fine for six months then quit working. buyers beware as the farouk/chi company will not honor their one year warranty for internet products. on the warranty card in the box they clearly state that products bought on the internet are not warrantied. this discalimer is not stated on the amazon web page. even on an iron with a warranty farouk chi charges 15.00 for the repair. after many back and forth emails amazon replaced the hairstyling iron themselves, so hats off to amazon for doing the right thing."
1,still waiting,"I purchased a CHI from nocurls and found the owner to be quite rude. Their straightener sizzled my hair off only after a couple times of use, the metal plates started melting off of the handles in my hand, quite hazardous. They said to send straightener back and they would possibly refund or send me a new straightener, and i have not recieved either. I sent the straightener over 5 weeks ago, and thought that the owner was quite uncompassionate to the situation. Still waiting on anything, i am not sure if they have recieved it or not, should be there by now."
2,Stopped Turning On,"I give this item 2 stars only because it did work well for the first year. It straightened my hair a lot faster than any other brand. However it no longer turns on, less than one year after purchasing it. And I only used it maybe once a month, so only about 10-12 times. Nothing I can do about it either so I'm pretty mad. I've tried everything and it just will no longer turn on."
2,pick another one,"It does not have adjustable temp guage like the Hai does and it gets really hot. It feels like it's burning my hair. but it's light weight and small plate allows for quick easy straightening. If you have a lot of hair, or wavy/curly hair, this one won't help you get it really straight."
1,COUNTERFEIT,"Upon receiving this CHI flat iron, I took it to a local beauty Supply (ULTA) and was advised this was a counterfeit CHI. DO NOT BUY a CHI online...if the price sounds to good to be true, it's because it is. All authentic CHI's have a serial # engraved on them and are a faded black color. The ones on Amazon are shiny black plastic. I made the mistake of buying 2 on the internet from 2 different sellers and they were both different and FAKE. Also, your warranty is only valid when purchased from an authorized CHI dealer."
4,CHI 1 Inch Flat Iron,"The flat iron heats quickly, irons smoothly. My particular 15 year old loves it. Only problem I have is that on switch is on the inside and the little red indicator light is as well. Does not affect the product use, just need to remember to check that its off!"
4,"great product, but...","I loved the CHI at first. It does a wonderful job of straightening my hair and leaves it so smooth and straight. But, after a few uses I started noticing my hair was singed. It doesn't have a dial to turn down the temp or anything. I have just gotten some protein conditioner and use that and I try to only use the CHI on occasion. It is NOT for every day use! Which really is a bummer since I love the way it makes my hair look, just don't like the singed hairs!"
3,I'm sure that it works,"...but there are absolutely no included instructions or tips for styling. Also, the wands didn't come together tightly enough to make much of a difference on my hair. Quite a disappointment for the $$ spent."
1,would not turn on after 3 uses!,"I don't know what to say about this product. I was convinced it was well worth the money after reading some of the reviews, but after 3 uses it would not turn on anymore! I have no idea what happened. Luckily I purchased it through Amazon, and they are sending me a new one right away. So a word of caution: buy through Amazon in case it breaks; then you have a guarantee that they will replace it if it's less than one month old. Hopefully the new one will live up to the hype! I have been wanting a CHI for years now."
1,didn't work,"Probably the lemon of the batch - I have a Turbo Chi that works fine that I've had for 2 years but needed a back-up. At this low price, decided to try a Chi that doesn't have a temp control. This one worked fine the first day but the second day it wouldn't turn on."
3,Chi hair straightener,"I bought this straightener after using my friends one day. I have long hair, she has short hair. My hair had already been straightned that day (way earlier) and needed a touch up so I used hers, I loved it then. I bought my own though and wasn;t as satisfied though and I think its because my hair is very long. My old straightener had a comb in the straightener and this one does not so it doesn't separate as it straightens. I end up using my old one then finishing it off with the chi..pain but it works....so if you have short hair I highly recommend this product if not then you may not like it!CHI Ceramic Hairstyling Iron for Silk Smooth Hair Model No. GF-1001"
2,Not as good as expected,I was expecting a lot fromt his straightener cosidering so many people brag about it. To be honest my $50 straightener worked better than this one. Didn't straighten half as well as it should have. Quite disappointed if I do say so.
1,do not buy from Farouk!,"I bought a flat iron from Farouk for my daughter two weeks before Christmas. She began to use it on December 26th. January 27th the iron surged with heat, burned my daughter's hair (so that she had to cut the fried hair off) then quit working all together. Farouk said they only guarantee their products for 30 days and too bad! They would not work with me at all to replace, refund or repair the iron. I will NEVER purchase from them again!"
1,Back it went for a refund,"This is a $10 iron in an overpriced box - no auto shutoff, no temp control, no frills at all. Just two heating elements, a cord, and a cheap switch in a flimsy plastic housing. And... after purchasing, I find that the company will not honor the warranty if purchased through Amazon! Given the track record many problems with this item, without a warranty you're taking your chances on something that's WAY overpriced."
1,THIS IS NOT A REAL CHI,This is not a real CHI! My real CHI that I had for 5 years was dropped in water and broke. I ordered a replacement on Amazon. When it arrived I knew it was fake. I compared it to my original CHI and the weight of the new one is much lighter and all of the materials used are obviously much cheaper. I've had it for a week and the on light is already starting to go out. They should say that it is a knock off in the product description. I have been ripped off.
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this straightener with high expectaions because I used a Chi in the past and loved it. But, when I received my product and tried it out, it had a strange hot smell, and after putting one strand through the plates totally stopped working. I tried unplugging, replugging, and resetting, none of which worked. The straightener cooled down almost immediately and would not ""come back to life."""
5,Love it,I bought this one for my daughter since I already have one. I love it. It heats up quickly and it's ready to go.
2,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron,The CHI flat iron worked only briefly before the on/off switch just wouldn't move anymore. I sent it back to Amazon within 30 days of purchase.
1,Not worth it.,I was excited to find this item at this price. But 7 months later it quit working. It isn't a good buy if you have to replace it every few months.
1,FAKE!!!,"This is not the real thing!!!!! It doesn't work, its a fake product, and it sucks so much for the amount paid"
1,ITS A KNOCK OFF,This product is not even real I was so mad when it came becuase you could tell right away that it is not a real CHI it is not heavy duty like every other chi I ever owned or bought at COSTCO GOOD LEARNING LESSON Pay the price bc when you pay less you get less.
1,Not a great value for 4 months of use!,"Bought this based on reviews, so I thought I would submit my expierence. I purchased this in April, received it in May, and it wouldn't turn on in November. I am not hard on my items, and used this gently. I can't return it under the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Do yourself a favor, and buy something else."
3,Not sure about this product,"I think this chi is a fake. I have a real one purchased from Target that died after a few years and then purchased this one. Doesn't heat up as well, and is very light. Works pretty well nonetheless. I recommend this one over the cheaper ones you can get at the store."
1,Chi was fake,The product I received did not work properly upon arrival and was confirmed by Chi in Texas as a fake.
4,Christmas Gift,Bought this product to replace my wife's current flat iron. My wife really likes the product. She tells me that it being smaller makes it easier to manage the way she style's her hair and it heats up quickly. She did tell me that she doesn't like the on switch being on the inside but that isn't a deal breaker. From my wifes reaction and her compliments about that product I would recommend it.
2,Overrated,"My daughter BEGGED for a CHI straightener for a YEAR ! ! ! When I finally broke down and spent almost $100 for it, within a week she no longer liked it and went back to using her $25 straightener. The CHI seems to have poor construction and pulls her hair because the heating pads are loose and strands of hair get caught between the frame and the pads."
2,Pulls Hair,"I just returned it. Because the ceramic plates do not wrap all the way around, your hair gets easily snagged. I actually got a headache the first time I used it from my hair being pulled and was very disappointed. Plus, it only has an on/off switch. The one I had before had a choice of temperature, which I prefer. This flat iron is definitely not worth the price."
3,serves its purpose but leaves a lot to be desired,"it says its heated up when it still takes a while to get hot enough to really get my hair straight without going over it a bunch of timesi also wish i could adjust the heat like the velvet coated original chi, that would make my life easier. like the velvet seemed to protect surfaces better.but when its hot it serves it purpose"
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"I ordered this product, came in great time, but I returned it unopened a day later and have yet to recieve my refund. I recieved notices to my email that my refund had been processed, that was now over a week ago and I still have no refund!! I'm very irritaded and frusterated, I refunded your product, now please refund my payment!"
5,Farouk CHI,Excellent product! The greatest hair straightener we've experienced. Fast and easy to use.
1,"""Farouk"" is not the maker of Chi","If you notice in the subject line it says ""Farouk"" Chi, Farouk does not make Chi, Chi makes Chi. This is a knock off. Beware!"
1,No warranty,If you do buy this from amazon you will NOT have any type of warranty on it because amazon is NOT a authorized seller and it may already be damaged/old/or not even the same product. The only way to guaranty that your getting any type of professional hair product or appliance is by going to a authorized salon that sells it.However as far as the iron it's self it is good but it's not my favorite one one the market. For about a year they started making them in china or japan (I don't remember which) and there quality went down quite a bit but about two years ago they did start to produce them in America again and it helped but it made me lose faith in this company.The iron its self is a standard 1 inch plate which is covered in ceramic. They do not have a temperature control so it can get very hot if left on for long periods of time.
1,CHI 1 inch ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,This product was given as gift to me by my dear and loving husband .I was too excited to use this product with all kinds of lovely reviews about it(which i think would be fake).But after use of this producty i found it worthless and a waste.It does not straighten your hair at all .I waste to spend money on .I think this will give you a bad word of mouth.The product does not have a good heating material.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! ALMOST LIT ON FIRE,"Yes, the chi got my hair VERY straight. It also gave me horrible split ends and bad hair breakage up near my part, but I was willing to deal with it because it straightened my hair so well!HOWEVER, yesterday it stopped working after about 8 months of use. Not only did it stop working, it created a HUGE spark, one that was so big I was sure that it would light on fire. This wasn't just mine - I know of plenty of people to whom this has happened. Of course, my warranty was void since I bought it on amazon. Go figure.There are a ton of other flat irons out there that get just as hot as the chi and have ceramic plates. Buy one of those!!"
1,Completely Fake,"I have used CHI products for 10 years and this is as fake as they come!I was so upset to open the box and realize that I had been had, I decided to plug it in and try it to see if it would work the same and let me tell you, It does NOT! Shame on you Amazin!"
1,Counterfeit Iron,This product stopped working 6 months after it was bought. I emailed Amazon to see if there was anythign they could do and they said since it was over 60 days I would have to contact the manufacturer. When I spoke to the manufacturer and gave them the model number they told me that the iron was counterfeit. Very disappointing!! I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering this iron for $60 on Amazon when I was actually taken for.
1,It lasted 5 months....,My first Chi straightener was great. It lasted for years but eventually died. I replaced it in August. This one died after five months. I talked to my stylist who said that he has heard similar complaints. Its too bad. It used to be a good product. But they aren't what they used to be. I purchased the HSI straightener today.
1,Not satisfied,I was disappointed to find out it was a knockoff not authentic at all. The first day I used it the name starts to rub off.
1,DO NOT BUY,I purchased this & obviously it is a fake. I purchased it in late October and this week (6 weeks later) it just stopped working. It won't even heat up. I will spend the extra money and buy one locally.
4,got this for my girlfriend,It works good I guess. She seems to love it. I got it for her over a year ago and its still working so I guess thats good.
2,FC,"Had two of them that stop working after 6 months. Just returned one to the company for replacement, but had to pay $15.00 to have it replaced."
2,Great straightener until it stopped working,"My mom has always been a CHI lover so I bought her this for Mother's Day. It worked great for a few weeks and her only complaint was that the on/off switch was a little too easy to move. This product comes with a 30-day warranty, unfortunately, a few days after the warranty was up, the straightener stopped working. It worked great one morning then that night just wouldn't turn on. Very disappointing because she's always had great experiences with CHIs but not this one."
2,CHI FLAT IRON ....OKAY,My friend has one that looks just like this one but it works so much better on my hair than this one. I don't know what the difference is because they are suppose to be the same brand.
1,Doesn't work,"The chi iron doesn't work it burned my hair and there was no way to turn it down. I used to have one just like this and it worked fine, don't know if it is an imitation or what !!!!!"
5,RMCinNC,This flat iron is EXCELLENT! I use it on my hair and my daughters. It makes your hair very shiny and healthy looking. I am looking for a 1/2 inch to use closer to our roots and edges.
2,Great Iron - but unlucky pick,"This is a great, quick-heating iron that makes my hair feel like silk. Unfortunately - the one that I received has a faulty cord. ...right where the cord meets the base of the iron...where it swivels. It appears that there is a short in the wiring. I am able to turn the iron on and let it warm up, but once I pick it up or move it, it turns off (and on and off and on and off...). I can hear it ""fizzle"" as it switches back and forth. I paid under $70 for this product that most people pay $100+ for. It works just fine for now because I let it heat up and then quickly iron my hair before it loses heat...but I suppose eventually it will stop working all together."
1,Huge disappointment,"The product is much smaller than it appears in the photograph. It holds only a very small portion of my hair at a time. The battery barely works. I purchased it for the battery component and it loses power almost instantly. There is no difference between the different heat settings. It does not work with low voltage such as the hotel razor outlet--mine is 110v and the iron doesn't work when plugged in. For the amount of money you will pay for this, you should get a LOT more. I was hugely disappointed."
1,Do Not Buy Anything CHI from Amazon!!!,"I have bought 6 CHI's from Amazon. 1 for me, some as gifts and others because friends used my account. 5 out of 6 have broken and none of them are under warranty. I have called Amazon and CHI. The CHI people said that since I didn't buy it from an authorized dealer the warranty is not valid. Amazon said after 30 days I get nothing. What a rip off! This had been the only item I have been disappointed in and with Amazon."
3,DONT BUY THIS!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I bought mine less than a year ago and after using it about 20 times total the part you plug into the wall broke!!! I cared for this iron very well and now when I plug it in one of the silver ports is very wobbly and will not recieve a charge from the outlet. Also a huge chunk of plastic broke off next to the silver port so now the inside is all exposed. For years I bought cheap curling and flat irons from Sally's and other beauty supply stores AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS EVER!!!! I am sooo disapointed my $80 flat iron is ruined!!!! Don't do it!!! I got this off Amazon and i heard the warranty is void b/c of that!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY - WARRANTY IS VOID IF PURCHASED ON INTERNET,"I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year. The iron stopped working. I thought, ""Great! Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!"" After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet. This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron. DO NOT BUY!! WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn't even have a valid warranty!"
5,Loved it!,Got my straightener in right after New Year's and it's been working great since! It heats up fast and straightens wonderfully. Great price!
4,Bought it. I broke it but I won't replace it with another CHI.,"Let me say, I really liked this iron. It didn't break on its own; I blew it out when I plugged it in to a faulty UK adapter. My bad. ANYWAYS, I like this iron because it never burned my hair, it made my hair soft and gorgeous. I would love to use my CHI right now. The only complaint I have with it is that it does not have adjustable temperature gauge on the side. I think those are important because I do not wash my hair everyday and on about day 3 or so, there is a little oil or buildup and I would like to turn the temp down as not to burn my hair. (My stylist told me that hair products hold heat and you should use less heat if you have any product on your hair.) So, when I replace it, I will get an iron with a temperature gauge on the side."
1,LWebb,"Do not waste your money. Ive had it for just over three months and it wont even turn on. Now of course its ""past the return window"" and there's no way to get your money back. A partial return with me paying the postage!!! Major POS"
5,I love it!,I love the CHI. I have really thick hair and I tried other flat irons but they never worked as great as the CHI.
5,great product!,"I was skeptical at first about ordering the 1"" Chi flat-iron. I have tried many cheaper models in the past, and all of them have done a very mediocre job. My hair is extremely frizzy by nature, so I had all but given up on the aspect of ever wearing my hair straight. Friends told me about the Chi, and how much better it is on their hair, so I finally cut the purse strings and ordered one. I couldn't be happier with it. I get compliments on how nice my hair looks every time I wear it straight. My Chi doesn't leave my hair looking like it's been straightened, rather it makes it look as though it has always been straight. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a good flat-iron."
5,Well Worth the Money/ GREAT Shipping,"My hair is severly damaged from dyes and lesser-quality straighteners, my friend had one that I used constantly and it works WONDERS on my hair. My sister recently purchased one, and I used it almost everyday. It makes my hair look shiny, un-frizzed, and basically makes my hair look un-damaged. You can't even tell that I have really bad hair when I use the straightener. I ordered it and it came within 2-3 days, just like it said it would. I highly reccommend purchasing it."
3,Better than the drugstore straighteners...,"I've been a flat iron user for several years now. People have raved in online reviews about the CHI Iron, so I decided to splurge and give it a try. While I did feel that my results were better than the less exepsnive models, I'm not blown away by my results. One of my biggest complaints is that my hair still gets frizzy and wavy by the end of the day, even after using styling product. My hair isn't even that unruly, so this is disappointing. I also find that my hair sometimes snags and pulls on the plates. Ouch! This iron still seems to require a lot of time to use, and I have to go over the same sections of hair again and again to get them straight.If you're willing to splurge on a straightening iron, there may be better options out there."
1,"At all costs, avoid this seller completely","Like the title says, avoid this seller at all costs. Purchased a ""Chi"" (I will explain the quotes in a bit) from this company, received it within a week, stopped working within 3 months, tried to contact the company, but there is no number to contact them at. The minute the ""Chi"" broke, I went to JCPenny's to purchase a new one since I cannot be without my straightener. After a little close examination, I realized I was sold a FAKE CHI from this company. Seriously people this is a WARNING, THIS COMPANY SELLS FAKE CHI's. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. As for now, do yourselves all a favor and buy your Chi at a retail location to avoid getting scammed. Would have given this review a 0 star if possible..."
5,Best flat iron,I have owned this same flat iron previously and broke the box housing the electrical plug-in. I tried going without a new one since I have a curling iron however just can not get the same results. I purchased a new flat iron and Amazon offered it at the best rate I could find. Shipping was prompt and I was very happy with the transaction.
4,Great results,"This is my 3rd time buying this flat iron in 10 years. Aside from the flat iron burning out after 5 years the first time and the on switching breaking after 4 years the second time, this is a great product! My hair is always straight and shiny. I tried a few others and none compare when it comes to long lasting results."
1,fake,Returned the product right away. This is not a real CHI straightener and I was not happy with this purchase at all. DO NOT BUY!
3,Check the specifications very well,"This product is so, so, I have very curly hair and it does straighten my hair okay, however it takes me a long time to do it, the thing is that this product does not have a temperature regulator so you are not able to control that, that is the only thing i did not like about it."
1,Only lasted 6 months,"I bought this for my daughter because one of her freinds had one and said it was great. The one I bought for her only lasted 6 months. It will turn on for a second then it turns off. It started doing this about a month ago, now it won't turn on at all. I would not spend the money on another one. I definately would never pay over 100.00 for a chi if they only last 6 months. Maybe I was just unlucky and got a bad one."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS!",I loved my CHI straightener. I was a great product BUT it broke 5 months after I got it. When I emailed the seller for my money back or a new on they did not get back to me. I emailed them twice and they didnt get back to me. Thats just rude. You might as well buy this product from CHI itself not Amazon and definitely not this seller.
1,fake Chi! Burned my hairs!!!,"I would give negative starts if I could. I had it for 4 months now. This morning when I was using it, I smelled something awful, then I see some brown color stuff sticked on my hairs. When I touched it, a good portion of my hairs broken down!!! I then noticed there were hot glue leaking out form the cemeric plate. I can't image what would happen if it gets on my skin. FAKE FAKE FAKE CHI!"
4,Pretty good flat iron,"This flat iron works well enough and gets the job done. Im African American so I have pretty tightly coiled hair. I use this iron frequently when my hair is not relaxed and have not been dissapointed. Sometimes I have to pass it throught my hair 2-3 times to get it as staight as I want it, and that would probably be my only complaint. My cousin who is a hairdresser own a Paul Mitchell flat iron and I must say it straightens hair really nicely. Of course it is more costly than the chi, so if money is limited and you are looking for a good flat iron this one will do. I noticed some other reviewers complaining that the cord shorts out after a while but I haven't had that problem and I've owned mine since 2009."
1,No customer service,I bought my daughter a Chi flat iron for Christmas last year. It broke within 3 months and I returned it as instructed with a $15.00 check to cover postage. My check was never cashed but our flat iron was never returned. I'm out the cost of the iron with no iron to show for it. Quite a sneaky way to do business. Get the cost of the product up front then if it breaks just have it sent back and forget it! I did not purchase this product from Amazon but I wish I had. I might have a working flat iron in my posession. I spoke with another person just today who had the same problem with a Chi and she finally got her Chi back after 1 1/2 years but it was still not fixed!!
1,HORRIBLE! FAKE!,"If I could give this seller zero stars, I would! I had a REAL Chi for over 5 years before my maltreatment of it finally caused it to die. My dad bought me this one (from this seller, through Amazon) as a gift. I got it today and let me say, it is a joke! The REAL Chi is supposed to get hot quickly in order to get your hair straight and smooth in one swipe. This one BARELY gets warm, and took me 3x longer to even get somewhat of a decent result. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I feel horrible my dad's thoughtful gift was ruined by such a crap seller."
1,Not a real CHI,"I purchased a CHI about 4 years ago from Amazon and it was great. It finally broke last week (the plug is cracked so I may have dropped it one too many times). I replaced it with this CHI (TracTrend was the seller). It stopped working the second day I used it while I was in the process of straightening my hair. Definitely wasn't a dropped plug this time.A number of other reviewers on Amazon indicated the quality of this item was sub-par, but I bought it anyway. In comparing it to my old CHI, the cord was shorter, the iron itself was a little lighter, and the material was of poorer quality. Either CHI is cutting corners or TracTrend is pedaling fake CHIs on Amazon and getting away with it.Amazon should really investigate this."
2,A 100% fake!!!!!,"I know, why would anyone think you could get a Chi for 45 bucks? You can't......it does an OK job, but nothing like the real CHI. Don't waste your time or money....PLEASE"
1,CHEAP!,i got this because of all the reviews and its sooooooo cheap! it should be a $9.99 flat iron. didnt heat up and the light was just blinking. the people who gave this thing a good score has either have no hair have staraight hair or be on drugs. dont buy it $60 for a cheap product $20 more and you can get a WAYYYY better flat iron. the first day it was shipped to me i shipped it right back didnt have it even 24 hrs
3,do not buy!!,"Ok so i am obsessed with my hair, and I am one to tell you the truth. I needed a new flat iron so I bought a ""chi"" from amazon.com. After a few uses it completely blew out, so I decided to see where I could get a new one from besides amazon, and low and behold the chis up here are fake!!!...Original chis are shiny and do not have the logo printed on top, so yes I wasted my money...however now I have a new and real one and am quite satisfied!"
1,FAKE Disappointed,The sellers of this item should be ashamed of themselves. I received this as a gift for Christmas and it stopped working after it turned on ONCE. The sellers are now not responding to my emails seeking a return. Thanks for ruining the one Christmas gift I was truly looking forwards to.
1,I only used it for 2 months then it melted!,"When I first got my Chi, it was awesome! It straightened my hair in no time until about 2 months of usage. I plugged it to use one day and went to my closet to pick out an outfit. When I went back to the bathroom, I saw my Chi smoking and one of the ceramic plates, whatever was underneath it had melted making it worthless. Can't get my money back either! SO DON'T BUY IT!"
5,Chi flat iron,"The chi was a great price, works very nice. Shipping was very quick. Would recommend this product. The price was so great bought one for a gift also."
1,Buy a different straightner please.,"This straightner, at first, was absolutely amazing. But then, I put it down, and it broke in half! So,I finally got another Chi straightner, and it was okay-not as sharp and great as my first one. Using it for about a month, it started to decive me; turning off when I picked it up, and warmed up when it was off. I would rather buy a Chi at Target."
3,Straightener is just okay,"I was surprised that this straightener wasn't better since it supposedly retailed at $190. I was able to get a really good price on Amazon, but I don't believe it's worth any more than what I paid (a little over $60).I like my Paul Mitchell straightener much better. My Paul Mitchell is smoother when straightening and I can set the heat. This one has no heat settings. I bought the Chi Wet/Dry straightener for my daughter a little over a year ago and it died completely at just a year old. I had paid $150 for it on amazon. I was hesitant to buy another, but the price on this one sold me. Now I know that I will stick with Paul Mitchell in the future."
3,Average Quality,"I bought this because the one my daughter has works so well. This one works ok but it doesn't feel as solid as hers which is the same model. The hinge is loose and slides side to side when using it. I almost feel it may have been refurbished. It straightens my hair, but I think it lacks top quality."
1,Chi not!!!,I bought a Chi hair straightener a year ago and it worked great for the first 11 months then all of the sudden it just stopped getting hot and then died all together. It's too bad that the Farouk company claims to give a 2 year warranty and then won't honor it if you buy it from any seller on Amazon.I will never purchase another Chi or any other appliance from anyone on Amazon again!!
2,Not authentic CHI product,"Purchased this product for my daughter in May of last year and it has ceased to function. When she contacted the company and subsequently returned it for a new one with an appropriate fee, they returned her check and the product stating that the could not honor the return because it is not an authentic CHI product."
1,broke after 6 months,"My flat iron broke after only 6 months of use... just completely stopped working and would not turn on anymore. Seller did not respond to my request for a refund or replacement. Was not dropped or misused at all, still in otherwise perfect condition but would not work in any outlet."
1,VERY Disappointing!,"I'm 99% sure that I purchased a knock-off ""chi"" flat iron. When I received it, I found that the cord connection was faulty, but I thought it may be a new safety feature - that the iron shut off automatically when the cord spun around (in case it fell off of a countertop onto the floor, for instance). This problem has gotten progressively worse and now it's hard to find a single cord position where the iron will stay ""on."" It takes me twice as long as it should to straighten my hair because the iron turns off in the middle of each stroke. I've only had this iron for three months - my last chi lasted for almost 5 years. In addition, the ""chi"" label on the iron is scratching off. I would NOT buy this again. VERY disappointing."
1,do not buy this item!,"I bought two of these, for my daughter and myself, and they both crashed within a week of the 60 day return limit. When we contacted the seller, they said to contact the manufacturer. The manufacturer said they won't honor the warranty because of how it was purchased. The directions are full of typos and I am certain that this is a fake. I should have paid attention when I read the reviews and others mentioned this problem, but I was taken by the fantastic sale price. Do not buy this product!"
1,Broke after 1.5 months,"For 1.5 months it did what it's suppose to do. Now it won't turn on anymore.I understand that products are not made well anymore, but shouldn't it last at least a year, or something?Would not recommend buying, especially seeing other reviews. Looks like it's a common problem.Amazon won't accept a return after 30 days. Wonder if seller will contact me now to ask to take down this review in exchange for a replacement..."
3,not as impressed as i though i would be,"Well ive always used a Revlon non ceramic one. it has lasted forever, and staightened my hair pretty quick. My only complain was it was curly by the next morning, with any humididy and anytime i sweat even a little bit. The Chi definetly last a lot longer and gets hot realy quick. But it doesnt take any less time to straighten and doesnt get any straighter. I expected a miricle i guess."
3,its a fake,"I had an original chi iron and it broke so i went looking for a good deal on an other one, and ended up buying a fake one. It works it does its job but is not a really chi iron"
2,"Good, but didn't last long","I liked this Chi iron, but it only lasted 9 months and then died. There is no manufacturers warranty. Waste of money! My cheap, Wal-mart bought flat iron lasted several years longer than this Chi."
1,Bought for my Girlfriend and never worked!!,I have known about chi products for years now and i finally bought one for my girlfriend for her birthday and it never turned on. Im not telling anyone to not buy this product because i know plenty of people out there use it and it works wonderful. But for me the iron never turned on. Its just a hassle to have to return it and all and then 3 weeks after her birthday lets hope i get a working present this time.
3,No Heat Settings,"Overall I'd say this was a good product. I've only had the flat iron a couple weeks and the few times I've used it, it worked very well. The only thing that makes me mad is that nowhere in the product description did it mention that this iron does NOT have heat settings. You basically just plug it in and turn it on with no control over the heat. Luckily it was hot enough to get the job done. But for simple touchups it gets too hot so I have to use an older flat iron with heat settings to prevent from burning my hair!! So, facts given, it's your call."
4,FantastiCHI,"I was recommended this by some friends, and I'm glad I bought it. But I wouldn't give it FIVE stars... It's expensive for one thing, and it makes your hair a little greasy if you overdo it."
5,Love it!,"This chi worked wonders on my fine hair. I'm trying to grow it out and usually get too frustrated and cut it all off. Not this time! Heats quickly, gets nice and hot!"
1,PLEASE DONT BUY FROM AMAZON,"I purchased this product in Feb. After using it about 6 times, it no longer works. I cant return it to Amazon - and if I want it fixed, I have to pay more money! This is ridiculous. I wont be buying anything for amazon in a long time. The last item I ordered was a butcher's block that had knives missing. Maybe they should up their customer service!"
4,Works Great as advertised,"I am very happy with this purchase. The price was right and the quality is great. My hair actually seems healthier after using this flat iron. I was a bit skeptical due to the low price, but this flat iron is great quality. I think I am going to purchase another one for my daughter."
3,"It seems to be a good product, but not for the price",Conair sells other models cheaper than this and the quality semms to be greater than this chinease product. But it works good.
1,Absolute Garbage,"After a week of use, the plug separated from the unit. Then a piece of hot plastic immediately fell from within the unit. This after normal, almost babying treatment. You folks can have your ""wonder"" tool. I'm moving on from CHI and getting something that wasn't built by a bunch of chimps."
4,Very good flat iron,"I have always used Conair or Revlon flat irons before, and don't get me wrong, they work well for the price. I had just gone through my second Conair which lasted about 2-3 years. The finish was coming off and my stylist suggested a Chi...First: This price is really good!! Get it!I was surprised when I got the Chi that it only had ""on"" and ""off."" All my others had had temperature settings. But don't be fooled, you don't need a temperature setting for this thing-- it HEATS UP!!! I have fine straight hair, but use a flat iron to make the ends flip and lay the way I want them too. It does an excellent job and very quickly. Heats up quick and I am done with straightening in about 2 minutes with this lovely little tool. Well worth the extra money, just be careful as I have had friends who have dropped it and the plate broke. I keep mine propped open on a basket to make sure it doesn't get easily knocked off the counter."
4,much better than my old straightener,"I've had this flat iron for about a year now, and it was a worthy upgrade from my old model. It works quickly and effectively, and I haven't yet seen a curl it could not flatten! However, it is pretty pricey, and I have a feeling you might be able to find a comparable product at a lower price."
2,It does not work very well,"I decided to buy this flat iron after reading here some good reviews about it. First of all, it looked USED to me when I first opened the box. There were scratches everywhere. I'm sure it was not a new item, even though I paid for a new one. Then I tried on my dry hair and it worked fine. But since then, I have been using it after washing and blow drying my hair, when it does not work very well. I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly, but I guess it should not be a big deal. If the hair is a little bit curly, it will make it flat, but it's not the same as when you leave a hair saloon, which makes the hair so smoothly and really straight. Not sure where the magic is here. Perhaps my flat iron is already broken and I don't even know about it. Not very happy with this purchase. If someone can give me an idea of what's going on, I would appreciate it. Thanks."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"Ignoring the reviews I read on here, I purchased this from Amazon anyway. As the other reviews say, it was of a terrible quality. Truly, I have $20 straighteners from the beauty supply store that do a much better job than this. It barely even straightened my hair. After trying it once, I promptly requested a refund."
1,FALLS APART,"The first time i bought this iron it lasted about a year, I paid about $150 for it and thought it should have lasted much longer. The cord on it broke. I bought it again only because it was only $35 on sale. It lasted only 5 months, when the on/off switch fell out. That was after taking VERY good care of it, because i knew it was fragile. My sister has a different brand flat iron that has lasted for 5 years, in perfect condition. Buy a different brand, unless you want a disposable flat iron."
1,not so happy,"I purchased this Chi for use at my school only. I am a cosmetology student so I figured I would get something I knew would work on all hair textures, well I have had the Chi since the end of April and at first it worked okay (not as hot as I would have liked) but at the end of July my straightener will no longer turn on. I am not very happy and amazon is saying I only had until May 31 to return it!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Well, there is not much to say but the fact that after 5 times I used it, the product does not work anymore. My hair is pretty straight and I used it only when I needed a special touch on my look (once every 2 months I would say). I read the bad reviews here before I bought it, but I thought it would be worth to try. Save your time and money, it is a cheap material with horrible warranty policy."
3,Light weight,When I ordered the CHI it had the same model number as the one I owned for 8 years before it would no longer work. The current CHI weighs less and does not grab on to and clamp down on the hair as well. The first CHI was made with superior material.
3,Flat Iron,In the beginning it worked great. I loved it. After about a month it started to fall apart. The heating plates were coming off because the heat was melting the glue that kept it together.
4,Excellent product,"Really pleased with the straightener. Only complaint is there is no temperature changer. In every other way, it is awesome."
1,Fake,This item is a cheap fake version of a chi. It was in a box to make me think it was a chi product. Don't order if you want a good flat iron. Doesn't get hot.
1,Awful,"This is a terrible product. It doesn't have a way to adjust the temperature and it doesn't get very hot. You can tell that it is some kind of knock-off, there are typos on the printed text on the box. The body is rickety, it feels like the two irons are going to come apart. There's a reason this product is so cheap...it's cheap!"
1,Disappointed,"Having owned a Chi straightener for years, I decided to get another one to have as a spare. I love the first Chi I have. This one is not the same quality. It takes me forever to straighten my hair, and it doesn't really grab the hair. I will be looking for another product to replace the Chi that I just purchased. So disappointed."
1,broke within 6 weeks,"I really liked this flatiron UNTIL it broke on the 40th day after it arrived. As Amazon (and all internet sellers) is NOT an 'authorized' dealer of Farouk Chi products, the one year warranty is not applicable. AND after 30 days Amazon won't take it back for returns.I will have to buy it again at salon prices in order to get the warranty for the future."
1,THE WORST,I purchased this product as a replacement in January after I accidentally fried my previous chi in a foreign country. Yesterday the replacement straightener broke. The quality of this product is very sketchy- it in no way resembled the former chi. The plastic is flimsy and the straightener is much lighter than the original chi I purchased. I suspect this straightener is a fake and would warn any buyer against purchasing as this product has neither the longevity nor the quality that authentic chis provide. A $30 straightener from a major retailer would likely last longer and provide better quality.
2,Chi stopped working,"Loved my Chi, but after using it for just less than a year, the on/off switch no longer works, and I can't get it to turn on. This happened to my previous Chi as well, which I bought from an actual salon. I contacted the seller but have not yet heard back. good Chi for the price, but I wouldn't expect it to last too long."
1,Quits working in less than 6 months,"It was a great product for a great price, until it quit working less than 6 months later. And because I purchased it through Amazon, it wasn't covered under the manufacturer warranty, so I have to buy a new flat iron. This is the second flat iron purchased through Amazon to quit working in less than year, so I absolutely do not recommend buying this item. Buy a better quality flat iron from the manufacturer, so it's covered under their warranty."
5,Makes hair straightening so easy!,I can not believe how easy hair straightening is with the Chi. I love it! Amazon's price is very reasonable. Definitely a good buy!
3,Straightens great... but curls?,"I bought a chi becasue I saw that it could straighten and do curls. I love how it straightens. My hair stays all day with NO hairspray. I've seen how cute the curls are, and I was looking forward to trying some new hair styles. I can't figure out how to curl with it! I watched a utube video and everything and I still can't do it. I have a feeling this is going to take a TON of practice... and I might have to ask a professional hair stylist for tips. Frusterating!"
5,A must have for all women!,I just love my CHI! What was my hair like before owning this great product. This is a must have for all women who desire straight hair!
5,The Best!,"We bought this for our daughter, who is in college. She said it was all she wanted for Christmas.We found it on Amazon for much less than other websites were offering it for.She has loved it. She says it is much easier on her hair. It straightens faster, does not cause her hair to be dry and brittle.She would highly recommend it!'"
4,Awesomw,"I was hesitant to spend the money on a Chi, but I bought it more than a month ago and I can tell you it was well worth the dollars I spent! It works the fastest and does the best job of straightening my hair. And it get s HOT. Watch your hands, fingers, neck, etc. because it will quickly give you a burn that blisters. Keep away from small children if you have them; I can't imagine what it would do to their skin seeing what it did to mine. The only thing I dislike is the cord, which is unbearably long. It comes with a wrap to keep it tied up, but that seems to make it bulky and heavy. If I needed to plug my straightener in on the other side of the room it night be helpful, but in my small bathroom it's not needed. Minor detail, but can be annoying."
1,Not a real Farouk,"I got this for my wife for Christmas and when it arrived I was extremely disappointed. This wasn't a real Farouk Chi. My wife had one that she had purchased at a salon a couple years ago. When I got this one, I took it out of the box to compare it to her old one. It was obviously a knock-off with the look and feel totally different. The logo was a cheap sticker that was peeling off, the plastic housing had a different feel and look and worst of all, the irons themselves were significantly smaller than the real one.I returned this to Amazon and ended up buying the real one from another salon.Disappointing!"
1,Fake. broke after 10 uses,I should have listened to the other reviewers. When it worked it was great. But the ceramic coating just started melting one day. I treat my flat iron very very carefully and now it works no longer. The warranty is void since I purchased form amazon. One of my worst purchasing decisions.
4,Best I've found so far!!!,"I love love love this straightener. I have one issue, which is easy to fix, but took a few tries to figure out how exactly to fix it. When I use the straightener I get static electricity in my hair and you can feel it when you touch your hair. The best solution is to use a quick spray of aerosole hair spray at the root, and there's no more static!! I would totally recommend this product to anyone that straightens their hair."
5,excellent flat iron,"I like this product very much. It heats up quickly and because the ceramic plates are super hot, they can curl or straighten my hair in seconds without having to reapply the iron again. Highly recommend it. Make sure to use it with heat styling product."
1,"Don't purchase, Does not last!",I purchased this and used about 3 times befor it stopped working. A friend suggested I try this brand so I searched and found this one. I wish I'd read the reviews first. This iron is not consistent it worked on and off for 6 or so months then no more! Even worse the seller never returned my email. Beware!
3,CHI flatnening iron,This is a good product for thick hair. i haven't had a perm since may 2008 but somehow this product makes my hair smoother and silkier.
5,Love it!,This flat iron is the best! I would never buy any other brand! A little pricey but well worth it. Bravo.
1,There has got to be a better product for this price,"Do not buy this product!!! I have more frizzes in my hair than without using this iron. I even used the Chi Silk Infusion with the iron, thinking this might help, but no result. Some of my hair strands are sticking out as if I am a porcupine. This is a piece of crap, I wonder if the more expensive models are any worse. After using this product, my hair smells burnt. I might as well fry my hair good bye and sell it as fried noodles."
5,Chi,Bought this for my daughter and got her old generic one. Boy what a difference. The Chi is worth the cost. I will be buying one for myself soon.
3,using overseas,"I loved the chi flat iron until I brought it overseas from America and it short circuited. I plugged it into 220v and the gfci safety plug did not even work to protect my iron. What use is that safety plug if it is not going to work correctly? My chi flat iron no longer works, $100 some odd dollars wasted!"
3,Don't buy if you you have coarse black hair (Latin or African),"My wife is Guatemalan, and she has already complained about this after 3 uses. Evidentally, her Guatemalan hair requires ceramic plates wider than 1 inch. Also, she doesn't like the fact that you can't adjust the temperature. It's one temp for everyone according to Chi, I guess. In summary, this is probably great for Goldilocks, but for people with darker hair that isn't baby soft, I would suggest you look for a 1.5 to 2 inch wide plate."
5,Great flat iron,CHI makes the best flat irons around. The flat iron heats up quickly and is able to straighten my hair no matter it's condition.
1,Cheap China Chi,"This is not a 'fake' CHI, it is made by Farouk, it just isn't their higher quality product. The better ones are manufactured in Texas and this one is made in China. I did not know this at the time I ordered it online and the price was the determining factor here! Make sure when you purchase a CHI iron that it is made in the USA because there is a remarkable difference! I should have sent it back, but, I put it off and finally waited to long! Buyer beware and save yourself the time and trouble...purchase the US made CHI from the beginning!"
1,Fell Apart!,"I bought this as a b-day gift for myself and it fell apart within 3 months! I took very good care of it as I do with all my possessions but one day while I straightening my hair, I kept hearing a weird noise. I looked at the opening where the cord connects with the iron and there was glue oozing out. I touched it and it was loose! I immediately unplugged it, and when I moved the cord, it fell out. I'm convinced this is not a genuine chi. Contacted the seller, and no reply."
5,Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread!,I love this flat iron! I have wavy hair and have always wanted it to be straight and sleek - but could never get it quite right with cheaper irons. Then a friend introduced me to the magic that is the chi!The only problem with it .. it that it does break down after about 2 years - but I think its worth the investment for the amount of time I save every morning using it. Heats up quick and gets the job done fast. Just be careful because you can really burn yourself with this sucker!
1,Not hot enough,"My friend has the exact flat iron and it gets much hotter than mine. She purchased her directly from a salon, so I think there is something wrong with the one I purchased online."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I received a defective product and there was none in stock to replace it. When I asked for a full refund, the manager told me he would have to charge a shipping fee & a restocking fee of 15%.Given the nature of the situation I refused to accept nothing but a full refund. He spoke over me refusing to listen to my reasoning then began screaming at me. He demanded I post positive feedback first, and then he would refund my money. Feeling blackmailed I refused. He then told me I would get no refund at all. I have nothing in return for my 44.62. I can not help but wonder if the positive comments posted here have been coerced."
1,I wish I could get a response!,"I cannot review this Hairstyling Iron because although I was billed for it, I have never received it. I have sent emails to the seller and to Amazon and have had no response. My credit card company is now reviewing the charge. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with any item purchased through Amazon, and frankly, I am shocked that they have not done anything. I await a reply!"
4,Love it!,Great straightner! Doesn't seem to really damage my hair as much as my cheaper one. Worth the price!!
2,"Broke in about 10 months, just stopped working!!","Would not recommend this product, you think a flat iron would be good for at least a year or 2."
2,Didn't work properly...,"I bought this Chi for my teenage stepdaughter as a Christmas present. She's been wanting one for a while and was so excited to receive one. I have a Chi and have no problems out of mine, but the one we received from Amazon did not work properly, the irons would not heat and that was probably because the irons were falling off of the iron. Returned for a refund."
5,Great Flatiron!,Bought the CHI for my daughter-in-law and it's the only one she will use! Quality product at a fair price.
3,disappointed,had one before and loved...received this one and the irons were not straight so heating was not even..didn't close all the way...would rethink ordering another
1,NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER,"The first time I used the Chi straightener from this seller, it overheated and burned my hair. I have had/used many other Chi's before and have NEVER had this problem. I have tried contacting the seller many times and they do not reply! This company has poor quality products and I would NOT give them your business!"
4,"Finally, a product that lives up to the hype","For someone who HATES to do her own hair (lack of skill, laziness, whatever you want to call it), now I can maintain my own hair between salon visits, which are becoming fewer and further apart. After 30 minutes or so, my hair is straight. Bone straight. Even very close to the roots! I couldn't believe it. But you have to be careful because this thing is HOT! Make sure you use a sealant to protect your hair prior to using the CHI. My only concern (i.e. 4 stars instead of 5) is that my hair gets caught between the small spaces under the ceramic plates, which pulls my hair out. So I have to be EXTRA CAREFUL to make sure every strand of hair is gathered neatly before I close the CHI on my hair. I wish the mfg would fix that little problem. Otherwise, this is exactly what I needed. [...]"
2,I could have been better,"The straightener was good, but only for a couple of months. It didn't last as long as I anticipated for it to last."
1,Buyer Beware!!,I purchased this item and it was great for exactly 6 weeks. It comes with just a 1 month warranty! The 1 year warranty which comes with the appliance instructions is void if it's purchased over the internet. It certainly wasn't worth the 6 weeks of service it gave me.
1,Cheap Product,I purchased this product not even 1 year ago for approximately $55.00. The Chi iron has since stopped working. I can't even return it to get my money because the warranty is no good. I am very disappointed.
1,bad bad item,The flat iron I got was terrible. It was a Christmas gift that didn't work for my wife. It was embarrassing
1,Never received product.,"I was charged $90.08 for this product, even though it sates in the ad its $67.00 and I still have not received it! I want my money back NOW!"
3,Shipping Sucks,It has been a whole week since I ordered this product as a gift for my wife and the order still hasn't even processed yet. Very disappointed compared to past Amazon purchases.
1,NOT AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS!!!,"Do not buy this product!!! I have more frizzes in my hair than without using this iron. I even used the Chi Silk Infusion with the iron, thinking this might help, but no result. Some of my hair strands are sticking out as if I am a porcupine. This is a piece of crap, I wonder if the more expensive models are any worse. After using this product, my hair smells burnt. I might as well fry my hair good bye and sell it as fried noodles. eCK! Yup, this iron is that bad."
1,horrible shipping,i ordered this item forever ago and it still hasnt even been shipped.. i'm considering canceling it and going somewhere else if it doesnt get send soon.. i've been waiting for many weeks!
1,it doesn't work now what??,I ordered the Chi hair straightener as a grad gift for my niece and she just told me it does not work...what do I do next???please help!!!
1,waste of money,"Save your dough! This straightener does not do the quality of job that it is proclaimed to do! I have only used the product for a week, and each time I use it, I cross my fingers and hope that it will work. Unfortunately, the results are always mediocre. I am only trying to straighten the waves from my hair in the morning... it is not like I even have tight curls or extremely thick hair. I have used other straighteners in the past and doesn't even compare to the cheap ones!"
5,Best money ive spent,"This is my favorite product I've ever bought. This straightener does a great job. doesn't damage, straightens fast, heats fast, its perfect!"
5,excellent product,"Got the chi a few months ago, and I absolutely love it! A very versatile product that can produce different textures and styles in less time and without damaging your hair. A must have if your a girl with long hair like mine."
1,Be hesitant...many faulty products,"This CHI was the third that I bought inside of a month. I bought and returned two at a store by my house, and both were faulty. I figured it was the store and bought one off Amazon. This one worked...for less than a week. I can't consider it a coincidence any more. This item is not reliable enough for how expensive it is!"
1,Item defective on receive!,"Item isn't working. Amazon says contact vendor. Contacted vendor and still waiting for a response. Was expecting better service and protection from Amazon, but obviously they are just a storefront."
5,great value,"Same as the ones sold in the mall, department stores and last about a year or two depending on use. We've gone thru 3 so far in this household. The price is great... Thank You AMAZON!"
5,great product,"This is a great flat iron...straightens in one pass. Quick and easy. Heats up very quickly.Only problem: The product is supposed to come with a one year warranty, but when you read the fine print in the package, it says the warranty is void unless you buy it from a licensed salon. :("
5,Excellent,Love this flat iron....had one for many years and needed to replace. Saved $50.00 over Harmon Cosmetics Store price. Shipped quickly. Ar
1,Do not buy a Farouk Iron,I had the same experience as another user. The iron worked for 4 months and died. I sent the iron back to Farouk and they would not warranty it because purchased from an authorized dealer. What a dog turd! Don't buy this.
3,Doesn't get hot enough,"It is an ok iron but doesn't live up to all the hype. I have thick hair & it takes me forever to get it straight when the iron doesn't heat up as hot as my conair. If it had a temperture boost it would be great, but without it... just so so."
1,Broke within 3 weeks,The last Chi Flat Iron I purchased lasted 4 years. This one died in 3 WEEKS!!!!! Doesn't seem to authentic to me.Shipped the iron out for a refund and the company did receive it. I still haven't heard back from them. Hope I get my refund soon.
1,Keeps breaking,I bought 2 of these hair straightners. One worked for 6 months and the other for 14 months then broke. The red light went out and it stopped heating up. I sent them both back and got a free replacement for one of them as the other one was past the warranty so I had to throw it in the garbage. I foolishly bought another one and that died after 3 months.Friends of mine have raved about Hot tools..so I will get one of those and hope for the best. I never dropped it and carefully cooled it down before putting it away and never wrapped the cord around it so I can't figure out why it kept breaking.
1,Unhappy with New Chi,"I have used and bought a Chi in the past and absolutely love them. I burnt my last Chi during my last trip to Europe. I ordered a new Chi and even though I was aware that there is no warranty through Amazon, I took the chance and bought it anyway as I was trying to save some cash. NOT WORTH IT. I should have spent $100 rather than paying $46 as the Chi I recently bought SUCKS. It does not heat up properly and does not flat iron my hair. I had to go over each section at least 8 times and it still did not leave my hair silky smooth. In the past, with my old Chi that I purchased at a salon, once or twice was enough to flatten my hair. I left the room for 10 min. thinking it needed more time to heat up (which was never the case with my old Chi) and returned to retry flattening my hair. There was no change. After putting product in my hair, the Chi didn't even give off any steam as I ran my hair through it. It is quite apparent that I got a terrible deal."
2,SO SAD,"I purchased the CHI in APRIL 2009, yes APRIL.. And i woke this morning to find it is not working! i pushed the reset button, unplugged it and still NOTHING. i have contacted the 3rd party merchant to see how i can replace my CHI, but am beginning to wonder if its even worth the hassel or should i just buy the CROC flat iron. My girlfriend who is a hair stylist used this model on my hair, granted its more expensive than the chi, but it gave my very spirally, curly, spanish hair,... STRAIGHT JAPANESE HAIR. i'll keep you posted on how my RETURN goes with the 3rd party. There are mixed reviews about the return policies of this product."
2,Faulty Condition,"We purchased the Farouk Chi 1 Inch Ceramic Iron. It came in packaging that appeared to have been opened which was surprising since the listing said it was new.The iron itself works but for a glitch I've never experienced with other Farouk CHI's. I have to hold it upside down to make it hot. If I set it flat on a countertop it immediately gets cold again.Tried to contact the seller w/ no success, hopefully this review will promote a contact."
2,Non functional in less than a year,"My daughter insisted on this CHI flat iron because ""CHI are the best"".So, I spent the extra money to purchase it.We bought it in October and now here we are in July, 10 months later, and the appliance will no longer ""turn on"". The button just doesn't work.Thank goodness that cheap one from Target still works, and it is over 3 years old.I have curling irons that are older than my daughter and still work.NOT HAPPY. I still have the box and instructions that say the warranty is null and void if purchased over the internet. DO NOT BUY THIS APPLIANCE."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"Do not buy this CHI product!! I have purchased two CHI irons and both have malfunctioned in a very short period of time; one within 4 months of purchase. The company WILL NOT honor the one year warranty unless you buy it from an ""authorized"" dealer. If you buy it from anyone on the internet, they will not honor the warranty. I believe that these are expensive products that are very cheaply made, which is why they malfunction so quickly. Do yourself a big favor, and find a better brand of straightening iron to purchase. I will never purchase another CHI product because of their poor customer service and tendency to break within just a few months!!"
1,You get what you pay for so don't buy this,"I have the Farouk TURBO CHI 2"" iron and wanted to also get a smaller iron. I ordered this less expensive 1-inch iron because I wasn't sure how much I'd use it PLUS how different can it be from the other Farouk ""TURBO"" CHI iron I have? VERY DIFFERENT. It was cheaply made, and you couldn't adjust the heat setting - there is only one setting (ON) and this made the outer paddle (end) part get too HOT to touch or hold while pulling it down the hair. I returned this iron. The Farouk ""TURBO"" CHI 1"" is great (as is the 2-inch). It has the adjustable heat settings and the red felt on the ends so it doesn't get too hot. The smaller iron is great for putting curls and flips on the hair for a different look.*The CHI TURBO irons have heat seatings and red felt on the end so the iron doesn't get too hot to hold/touch. Far better all around. Look for the red on the iron in the pictures. Pay the extra money and get a good one."
1,Bought twice broke both times,"I usually don't write reviews, but after buying this item two times and it breaking both times I felt the need to share my experience. The first time I bought this item, for the first 5 months I loved it. Then for no reason at all one of the gold metal pieces that heats up popped out and I could never get it to stay again. I was so bummed. I thought maybe it was a fluke and because up until that point I loved it, I thought I would try again. Bad mistake. This time it lasted 4 monthe before the metal piece again popped out. The same exact problem I had before. I am in the process of hopefully returning it, but I am not going to hold my breath. I can tell you I will never buy this product again. [...] buck down the drain.Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron"
1,Do not buy!,I bought this item from Amazon and withing 5 months it wouldn't heat up anymore. There is no warranty. It is worth the extra money to go through an authorized dealer.
4,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Flat Iron,"I have always wanted a flat iron. I have curly wavy hair and I want to wear my hair straight. I looked at stores and I was not going to pay close to $200.00. I even looked on Ebay and when I thought I was close to winning one I would be outbidded. SO, that is when I found that amazon was selling them. I got one and I LOVE it. Not only did it make my hair staright it was smooth and soft. I live in FL and the humidity does a number on your hair. The CHI kept it straight even through the worst weather. I would say go for it and buy one."
2,Could never quite get used to it,"I tried using this product for a few weeks and could never quite get used to it. If you're looking for a good quality first-time iron, it does the job. But if you're used to using irons all the time and like me, want to have control over the temperature, I recommend the Remington T-Studio collection. It's a fraction of the cost (approx. $38) at your local Target, and temperature settings go up to 200 degrees, at your control. I prefer that and to save money vs. this product."
2,Just not worth the hassle.,"I love, love, LOVED my Chi hair straightener; then it just stopped working. It always worked wonders on my hair, but it wasn't worth the $100+ for only two months. If you buy it online, the warranty is void. Wish someone had told me that. Save some cash and do a little more research on other brands. You're bound to get lucky and find a cheaper product that won't bust after eight weeks."
5,Best Styling Tool EVER,"I was skeptical about buying this at first because of the cost. However, as soon as I had this bad boy in my hands I was completely sold. It is the only styling tool I use now that I have learned how to also curl my hair with it. (videos are on youtube) This was the best beauty investment I've made!"
1,It broke after using just a few times,It broke after using less than 10 times. I cannot turn it on and I am quite disappointed. I paid lots of money for it and it is only taking my space not doing any work.
1,Broken after 5 months!,"When I ordered this iron I read that it was a possible fake and I ordered it anyway.I was pleased with it at first because it looked legit and worked great. Then after 5 months it BROKE!!!!! Always handled it carefully, I take care of my stuff. I know it wasn't my fault...it just stopped working the other day!so I recommend when buying a CHI go to a hair salon and get a REAL ONE."
1,Would not recommend,"This works great but the surrounding area is hot and I have burned my hands and fingers, which I have not with other flat irons. Need more protection."
2,Broken,Purchased this in early March and worked great but now doesn't turn on. Def not same quality as other chi I owned. Very disappointed!
1,PLEASE READ THIS AND THE OTHERS,I am very quick to NOT make negative comments but when the seller doesn't even return e-mails then it is on. purchased a CHI Ceramic Flat Iron at Christmas for my daughter. It quit after 5 months. Last time I looked NEW electronics carry a one year warranty. Several people have said they had the same problem. DO NOT BUY A CHI ONLIONE FROM ANYONE. PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Defective Product,"I bought the Farouk CHI Ceramic Flat Iron for my neice for Christmas and it is already broken. According to the return policy, I will only receive partial credit and have to pay for shipping. I am not happy with the product and since I think it is a defective product I'm not going to waste money shipping it back to only receive partial credit. I will not order from this company again. This is the second time my family bought a hair straightener from this company that broke before a year had passed."
1,less than 4,I have had the Chi for 4 months. I do not use it daily & it died this week. Really disappointed.
1,Do not buy - breaks easily and no warranty,"**Edit: Someone posted a comment on my review saying that Amazon replaced theirs, so I emailed Amazon and they are sending a free replacement. Hooray for Amazon, Boo for Farouk. I'm still skeptical about the quality of these since there are so many reports of the irons breaking..........I bought this about 5 month ago and have only used it a few times but it is already broken- won't turn on. Unfortunately, when you buy their product from Amazon, Farouk does not honor the warranty. From the comments and numerous other reviewers saying theirs broke within the first year, I would say that these are expensive but not very well made.I will be buying another brand to replace this one. Shame on you, Farouk! I'll never buy another one of your products!"
3,Great Product/Customer Service lacking,"I purchased the ""set"" from my salon that included the BioSilk products, along with the flat iron. Love the products, love the flat iron. However, after some time, the indicater light on the iron started flickering and the unit would lose heat. Eventually, the cord sparked at the clamp end and nearly caught my hair on fire. I have left several messages with Farouk's customer service and have not had a return call. I was given info to return my iron for ""repair"" by the local distributor, but I would truly like to hear from Farouk to discuss. For the money ($180 for the set) I think this flat iron should have lasted me years and due to the defect, should be replaced without cost to me."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought this item to replace my previous chi which had broke. When I received this item, it looked exactly like my old one except it wouldn't even turn on!! I plugged it in and the red light would only come on every once in while, making it impossible for the iron to even heat up!! It seems to be getting worse day by day, if that's even possible. I've tried contacting the seller several times, it's been about a couple weeks and still no reply. I'm in the process of filing a claim with Amazon. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this item!! Spend a little extra on the authentic ones in the store, it's worth it!!"
2,Disappointed,"I finally ordered the real thing, only to find it was as bad as the imitations I have ordered and sent back..."
1,The Iron Melted Apart,"After owning the iron for only a few months the metal part that heats up would completely melt the plastic that's it's attached to and come apart. I could squeeze it back together and wait for the plastic to cool and harden, but this only took care of the problem until I turned it on again. I was excited about this iron and thought it would be great because it's a CHI. I didn't realize when buying it that it only heats to one setting, which might be the problem. The straightener gets way too hot and it actually fried my hair and caused split ends for the first time in my life. I've recently bought a new iron (the HSI, which I highly recommend). If you're wanting a CHI definitely pay extra to get one with a heat control adjustment!"
1,Chi Flat Iron,Stopped working before it was used 5 times. I am going to see how I return it and hopefully get one that works
1,fake and horrible,"i order it a year ago, i got the fake one , i hate it so much, my hair stuck in the iron and it doesn't iron welldo not recommended it , don't waste your money ....buy it at ulta for $20-$30 more but buy a a real one"
5,Love it!,"I have very frizzy hair and was never satisfied with my old straighteners. This thing is great! It gets super hot and just makes my hair lay flat and smooth, while keeping it shiny. I use some kind of heat protection product on my hair just to make sure it does not do much lasting damage, but so far I can't complain! The price is worth the product!"
1,Disappointed,I have been wanting a Chi flat iron for so long but never bought one because of its price. When i found this one for about $65 I was ecstatic. That didnt last long.It arrived within a week and i couldnt wait to use it. I plugged it in and a few minutes later i smell something burning. I pick up the flat iron and both plates are slowly falling off and the black plastic holding it together melts away. Almost like goo!I have many friends and know stylist who use Chi flatirons or brands with no issues. Im not sure i would blame chi or the seller. Its possible the iron was broken before and cheaply fixed. Not sure but overall it was a disappointment. The only good thing was how fast i recieved my refund.Lesson learned: Sometimes paying more is worth the time and money.
2,Not like it should be,"Okay, I'm not saying this is a knock-off, as others have said because of the lower price. But It simply doesn't work the way a seemingly identical iron that I've used does. It seems a bit cheesier, and doesn't have proper heat control to make a little flip at hair ends (I have straight, dry hair just straight cut above the shoulders). Anyway, I'm thankful I have Prime membership and I could return this thing without penalty. What a relief."
1,Stopped working after a few months,I recently bought this flat iron and it stopped working right in the middle of using it!!! Very disappointed with this product.
1,"WORST FLAT IRON, CHEAP WALMART REVLON IRON DOES MUCH BETTER!","When you first do your hair, it's shiny and smooth. By the end of the day, your hair will be back to it's normal texture. (I do my hair at 6:30am. Around 9, I notice it's wavy, thick, and frizzed like it normally is.) It doesn't have a tempature setting, and at 350 degrees my hair stays straight and beautiful. I'm gussing this flat iron is around 200 degrees. My Revlon flat iron straighted and kept straight. If I knew how to return this iron, and have the proper packaging, I would. I guess the next time I go to the mall, I'm going to have to spend hundreds of dollars on a iron at a kiosk. At least I will be able to tell if it does good with my hair..."
2,Doesn't heat up enough,"This is the 3rd Chi I've purchased (one was gift to my niece), and the first one I am not happy with. The red light blinks continuously, and the plates just don't get as hot as my previous Chi, which is evident in how my hair does not stay as straight and frizzes. I didn't experience this with the 1st one which lasted 5 years. Btw my niece still has hers and it is still working just fine. Not very happy."
1,FAKE CHI DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased a 'chi' from this seller in March 2012 and now, not six months later it has melted itself and no longer works. I contacted Farouk because they warranty their products for one year after purchase and come to find out this is a FAKE. They told me within 2 minutes based on where the item was manufactured that it wasn't an authentic Farouk Chi. I'd like a little action. Amazon doesn't do refunds or exchanges after 30 days and I can't seem to find where to contact this seller. I purchased this flat iron under the guise that it is real and quality, it is neither. DO NO PURCHASE from this seller."
3,It's OK,"It's a good iron; I don't think it's all that much better than cheap flat irons I've had. It gets the job done though.Careful - the plates are only coated with ceramic. I was under the impression that they were full ceramic plates, which is better for your hair, but this is not the case with this iron. It would have been nice to know that before purchasing."
5,O wow,Great product! My sister bought it from her friend's store with a discount and she tried it on my hair the other day. I loved it! I have frizzy curly hair that doesn't cooperate with me on most days and this product controlled it. I asked my sister to get me one. It leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!,"This product is a cheap knockoff of the original CHI. The moment you hold it in your hands you know it -it feels much flimsier. And yes, like others reported, it will stop working after a few times. Shame on Amazon for continuing to carry this product despite user complaints. Just because they have extricated themselves from supporting the warranty, does not make them any less complicit in selling this sub-standard product on their site."
2,Great product but DON'T BUY IT HERE,Verifying the other reviewer's story...I also had a CHI that was purchased on amazon.com. It broke about 3 months after I got it and I was told my warranty was VOID because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!
1,do not buy this here!!!!!,"If you are thinking about buying this item here, please don't! My second chi just blew up and by buying this item through Amazon you will lose the mfg. warranty and Amazon will only stand by the item for 30 days. Buy at a reputable salon as they don't last very long, that way you'll at least have a one year warranty."
2,Stopped working after 3 uses/great customer service,"The Chi straightner I had prior to this lasted over 3 years, however, this one lasted only 3 uses and stopped working. I contacted them and they had me return (I had to pay return shipping cost) and they credited my account the original price of the iron since they were out of other irons to replace with."
5,Great product.,"CHI is the best brand of hair straightening irons I have ever used. Other brands will take longer to style, and your hair will be poofy and wavy within hours. With the CHI, it is stick straight all day and takes half the time. I love this product! I think it gets hotter than other irons. And the plates are well sealed and dont grab and pull your hair when you're using it. Highly recommend, especially for this Amazon.com price."
3,Not hot enough,"I was excited to get a CHI at this price, but it's not what I expected. The plates don't get hot enough to straighten my hair. I have to do several passes to get my hair mostly straight."
5,great product!,"I love this flat iron! I have been straightening my hair for 20 years, and by far, this is the best flat iron I have ever used. It heats up in seconds, and really works well. I have very curly hair and this iron really makes it look salon straight! I would recommend this flat iron to anyone!"
2,CHI is great when it works!,This is my second CHI. The problem on the first CHI was that the ON light kept blinking and would not stay hot. I thought it was just old so I bought a new one. My guess is that there is a loose wiring issue on the rotating handle. I just bought it and already am having problems. I hope amazon has a policy of refunding when I return the defective merchandise.
5,Fabulous product,"Bought this brand on my daughters recommendation, and I love it. Does exactly what I want,and don't know how i lived without one before now."
1,very displeased.. had to send back and pay for it too.,"The product arrived on time and started to work. Then it would just cut off for no reason. I tried it in different outlets but still no luck. I ended up sending it back, did not get my money back for the shipping costs to send back and did not receive another one as they said they were out. Not happy with the purchase. still do not own a chi.."
1,Farouk does not honor warranty on Amazon purchases,After 7 months of use we experienced a defective cord. Upon trying to get repairs we were told Farouk did not honor the warranty on internet sales. We sent the Chi in to Farouk for repair along with a check for the out of warranty cost. The item was returned unrepaired with a note that Farouk would neither service under warranty nor repair products purchased via the internet. Amazon should disclose this in their review of the product. I'm not even sure this is legal.
1,Terrible Quality,I purchased this Chi in January and yesterday the cord started to break apart and melt. This is the third one of these which has had an electrical problem for me in the past few years. Do not buy this!
1,fake,This is a knock off. The writing on the handle wore off after 2 uses and I compared this to a friend's chi and hers says CHI (tm) this one says CHI (R w/circle around it)... It's supposed to be trademark not registered.
2,Chi -doesn't work after 2 months of use.,"I purchased this flat iron for my 15 year old daughter for her Christmas present. Although she has not used it much, it has stopped working. I am not pleased with this product."
1,Fake,I received my Chi in the mail today. After I read a few reviews I was concerned it might be fake. I looked at this site [...]l and the Chi is definitely fake. I am glad I read reviews or I would have never even thought to check if the product was real. I will be sending mine back first thing tomorrow.
4,Love it!,"The flat iron gets hot quickly and makes quick work of straightening your hair. It's also thin and light so it's easy to use, not awkward. Definitely recommend it."
4,Nice Flat Iron,"Not the best that i've ever used, but lightweight and pretty fast! I would recommend it if you want a better - than - average flatiron."
3,CHI 1 Hairstyling Iron,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The first one lasted two days and would not turn on again. Once notified, the seller immediately replaced it with a new one. We were impressed with the quick service. Hopefully it's longevity will be much, much better."
5,Best flat iron I've ever had!,This is an amazing flat iron. It heats up very quickly and it works so well. It makes me hair super smooth and works just the way I imagined it would. Definitely worth spending more money on than a cheap flat iron.
1,Product was DOA,I had to return the item as it came in DOA. I would have to recommend going with a different one.
1,HORRIBLE,I bought this chi June 29th of 2012 and it burnt out in November 2012 AND I HARDLY USED IT. Now I can't return it anywhere. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,Broke before suggested product warranty,The product broke before the manufacturer one year warranty. It lasted half a year. I have doubts that this would occur with an authenthic chi product considering all my other ones lasted more than two years.
5,great,Seems to works wonderful. Staightens my hair just fine. Takes a very little time to heat up which I like.
4,great product,"This is a great Straightener! Heats quickly, leaves my hair wave and frizz free. It sometimes catches and Yanks a few hairs out."
5,Still going strong after more than 10 years,"My aunt (who's a hair dresser) gave me a CHI for my bday back in 2000, and it still works today. Average use has been about 4x per week since then, and I'd say the only care has been to clean it with a damp cloth once in awhile (while off and cooled, of course), and to make sure that I didn't wrap the cord around the iron for storage. I realize that it's a very natural reaction to do this before putting it away, but constantly twisting/bending the power cord is not good for the internal electrical work, and that goes for any styling tools. If anyone has had problems with their CHI, my guess is that it's a result of doing this, at least in most cases. I can't compare the CHI to any other flat irons, because I've never owned anything else...never had a reason to purchase another one! But it's well worth the money considering the magnificent job that it does and how long it lasts."
2,Wouldn't order from this person again,The Farouk CHI flat iron that I ordered is not heating up properly. I've e-mailed this seller 3 times and haven't heard a thing back. I wouldn't order anything from EMAFERRA
2,not worth the money,this product doesn't work as well as some others I have found at Target for a lot less money.
3,eh,"I got this product a few years ago at the advice of my good friend who is a hairstylist. Sure, it worked great...until my hair started to get damaged from it. There are no temperature settings, and it gets incredibly hot. Plus, it breaks easily if and when you drop it (one of the plates came off in my case). I really hate that there is no automatic shut-off on this iron, especially since I am quite OCD, and have had to come back home several times just to make sure that I unplugged the unit. I'm sure there are better flat irons out there that have these features and are better quality."
2,"Not very well built, opt for the turbo version","I have been using straighteners for awhile. Started with regular drugstore brands and finally bought a 2 inch chi turbo (purchased online). I've had the 2 inch chi turbo for over a year, and I still am very satisfied with it. Recently I had a short haircut, so decided to get a chi 1 inch. Initially I ordered the regular chi 1 inch. After receiving it and trying it a few time, I was pretty dissatisfied. The flat iron feels very cheaply made, the light flickers, the handle bars feel flimsy. I took out the turbo and compared the two closely. Turns out the regular chi is made in China vs. the Turbo version is made in Korea. All in all, I returned the chi 1 inch, and ended up finding a turbo chi 1 inch at Target. I would definitely recommend the turbo version, the quality is just different."
3,Not worth all the hype,"This product came highly recommended to me by my hair stylist. On faith, I purchased the product even though it seemed rather expensive. So far, I have not found any difference in quality between the Farouk CHI and other similar, less expensive products. I would suggest that you try it out first before you buy it. Definitely not worth all the hype."
4,"Good, but split ends","This product is very good, with one exception: I get extremely bad split ends at the top of my hair. The straightener is great until i have to straighten the top layer. With this product, you can't go from the roots to the ends, because it will break the hair and your hair will have little fly-away hairs at the top that are a nuisance to go down. I use a straightening shampoo and conditioner so the roots of my hair are already straight, and all i need to do is straighten about an inch or two away from them to keep the hairs from sticking up. Overall, a fairly good product."
3,Disappointed with my curling iron,"I am disappointed with the purchase of my new expensive farouk Chi curling iron. The iron that I have used for the past 4 years was a $20 one that I purchased at Sally's. When it broke I decided to invest in the top of the line name brand ""Farouk Chi"". I don't think that it heats up as well as the cheaper model and it certainly doesn't grip my hair as well.Save your money!"
2,Breaks!!!,"Beware!! This iron worked very well for six months, until I plugged it in one day and it wouldn't turn it on. At this price, it should have lasted for at least a year. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing a CHI again."
4,great product,"This is a great product to purchase. It really does the job and whenever my hair is static when you glide the iron on your hair, it goes away. great too during the summer, esp when it's humid...hair is still straight and shiny."
5,Love it!,I have tried 3 other irons before I bought this one and I could not get them to perform for me. I just plugged this one in and it worked fantastic! I love that you don't have to worry about what to set the temp at either. Get it!
5,I love this straightener,"This straightener is amazing. My hair is so smooth. It even curls hair great. I've only had it for a month, but I've heard from others the Chi is the best one out there. This is also a great price for it."
5,good buy,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas so she would stop using mine. She loves it! It came in the mail much sooner than I had expected, even at Christmas time. I recommend any Chi product to whoever wants beautiful hair."
5,great,"I am familiar with this product, but I was a little skeptical about what I was getting into by ordering it online. Turns out it was perfect! In perfect condition and new, very great deal (half price compared to Target)!!!"
1,Stops turning on,"I bought this item 2 months ago. When I first got it, it gave trouble to go on; once I unplugged it, I had to keep pressing the reset button on the plug to get it to work, or switching it to another socket. Looking back, the message on the plug that read ""Press reset button if not turn on"" should have been a warning sign (not even proper English), but I didn't worry, because it always went on in the end. Well, that was until a few days ago. No matter how many times I press the reset button, my CHI ""not turn on"". I called Amazon, but of course the 30 days had expired (forget the warranty)! They did offer 80% back, however. Of course I have to pay for shipping and hope that it gets back to them. I figure that's better than nothing, but i am NOT reordering another one from this website."
2,Farouk CHI flat Iron,I did not like this Falt Iron because there was no way to regulate the temperature- I was afraid to burn my hair
1,Unfortunate,"Stopped working a month after I got. Warning: it is not under warranty unless you buy it from a salon. It cost me $35 to have it fixed, plus the cost of shipping it to Farouk's repair center. So not worth it. Also, it is a step up from a drugstore iron, but still highly overrated."
3,CHI,I bought this product with high hopes and was slightly dissapointed. It works a lot better than my cheap connair flat iron ever did but it wasn't this miracle straightner. I still have to go over my hair several times and my hair is pretty straight already. I think this flatiron will work better on some hair types than others.
2,Guide to telling if it's fake or not......,"I decided to buy one because of the many great reviews from this and the fact that it was a bestseller on Folica. When I did use it, my hair was softer and did not seem as fried as with other flat irons. However, after about less than 10 uses of this, I noticed how the light never stayed on and when the light went off, it got too cool to straighten the hair. I got frustrated to the point that I went back to my previously used hair fryer. I bought mine for less than 50 bucks on ebay and always wondered if I got a fake or not. I did find a great article that is a start in trying to figure if you have a real one or not. I thought it was helpful.[...]If the site does not show here, all you have to do is type in your search minus quotations, 'determing if your chi flat iron is fake'. It should take you to an article written by a huge seller on ebay that is probably reputable as they have many positive feedbacks."
1,Chi Iron not the best product,I know it came in a Chi box and says Chi on it but I have had two Chi Irons I purchased from Hair Salons that actually worked for about 6 years. This Chi from this company does not heat up as well as the other chi's. It feels very cheap. The quality of it is not very good. I have been very upnappy with it. It will not straighten my hair like the other chi's did. I would not recommend buying from this company I would go ahead and pay $50.00 more and get the good Chi. They are worth it. You learn from mistakes and I learned from this one not to go cheap.
1,broken in 5 minutes,"I bought this product <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009V1YR8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title> last week. This is what I experienced:- heated very fast (positive)- my hair got burned into crispy pieces at the first. I even heard the burning sounds. Then 5 minutes later, the power light went off...it broke. I unplugged and replugged the power switch many times. It never works again, sadly.- I called CHI customer service. The guy told me that they ""NEVER"" sell any CHI product online; therefore, it's not guarantied. I have option to mail it in, but they may or may not fix it depends on the product's originality (fake or not).Luckily, the Amazon return policy is very convenient and easy. I'm going to send the product back to Amazon and hope the next one will not break."
5,Was it worth the money? Yes it was worth the money.,"Got this for my wife. First thought - what the heck do you need a $90+ hair straightener for? She had been using a cheaper straightener for a while, and the Chi absolutely blows it away. She uses it every morning, and just this morning she said to me - ""I'm so glad we got that Chi. I never used to wear my hair down all day, but now I can, and feel comfortable.""Maybe $90 feels like a lot. But when you think about the many mornings that have been more enjoyable b/c we've avoided ""bad hair days"" (guys, you know what I'm talking about), I'd say it was worth the money."
1,Terrible,"I Purchased The Chi & I Plugged It In & Noticed It Felt Very Lightweight Compared To My Sisters' Chi Flat Iron. Then, It Wasn't As Hot As Theirs. Furthermore I Noticed That It Lacked The Chi Symbol. In Conclusion, Me & Other Friends Sat Down To Compare Our Chi Flat Irons & Discovered That The Product I Bought Was A Fake Chi Hair Iron. It Was A Bootleg Version & I Was Enraged. I Returned It & Hopefully I Am Refunded. This Experience Made Me Lose Trust In Buying Things On Amazin. Smh"
1,DONT BUY THIS!,"It had been four months, and one day, i pick up my chi straightener, and the metal plate had fallen out. the quality does not match the price. this one is worse than the 30 dollar iron i started with. now i've moved to a solia, and it works much better. the chi also gave my hair split ends instantly. most irons usually last for atleast a year. all i can say is that if you buy this, you are wasting your money!"
3,coated,"Prior to ordering or even opening the box, you'd think the plates were ceramic, but the insert states that it is ""ceramic-coated"" just like the cheaper flat irons."
4,My hair stylist was right on!,"The gal who did my hair for my wedding recommended one of these gadgets. She warned me that I'd have to spend about $100 on it, so when I saw the Amazon price, I was very excited. (I think it was on a Friday sale... it was only $79.99 with free shipping.) The iron heats up very quickly and you can do anything you can do with a curling iron with this little guy... only faster.I gave it only four stars because it has no automatic shut-off (a feature I have come to insist upon in my other hair gadgets) AND because the iron gets quite hot and you don't have the option of changing the temperature. This hasn't been a problem, but I can see how it could be with regular use... especially on fine hair like mine."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I've heard amazing things about the Chi flat irons, so when my cheap Conair flat iron broke, I chose to spend the money on this straightener. It worked fine for a while, but after 3 months it stopped working completely. There's no warranty for the product if it's bought online, so it was a waste of money. I went to Target and bought a T-Studio Tourmaline Digital Straightener and it works better than my Chi, has temperature control, and has a 4-year warranty. The Chi definitely wasn't worth the money that I spent for the short amount of time it worked."
5,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,"After using several flat irons, this one is the best.Easy to use and does not burn my hair. If you are considering buying flat iron, this is the one you should get."
1,Nothing but trouble!!,"I have had nothing but trouble with this iron from the first day. I can't return it because the warranty isn't from Chi, its from Amazon. The iron will heat for about 1 second, and shut off. It has never worked, and now I will buy the iron from the Chi company itself. Do not buy from Amazon, spend the extra money and buy it directly from the Chi!"
3,Hair Straightener,"Bought to replace same model that burned up. Reviews I read were not that good, so I was going to get a different one, but daughter had to have a chi. Must be a status thing, don't know. Anyway it works for now."
2,Great product while it works. Watch warranty.,"This is a great flat iron. Heats quickly and takes little effort. However, company will only honor warranty if purchased from ""Professional Salon"". They will not service unless under warranty. My iron only lasted 4 months."
1,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this item for my daughter in late February. For 5 months it worked well until just a few days ago when it would no longer turn on. I phoned Farouk Systems to inquire about this problem. They told me that Amazon is not an authorized seller of their products, thus are not covered by their warranty (they only warranty products sold through salons.) So, buyer beware."
1,Worthless knockoff- NOT REAL CHI!!,"This is NOT a genuine Chi flat iron. It's a piece of crap $1 knockoff at best. It fell apart after a dozen or so uses. The metal on the top literally came off from the cheap plastic as if it were stuck to the hollowed out plastic with Elmer's glue. I was suspicious it might not be real given the price, but I thought it might be an older model, and I trusted Amazon to screen merchants who sell through their site. My mistake. I knew when I got it that it felt much lighter than my previous authentic Chi, and the light that tells you it's hot didn't work the same. It didn't take long for my suspicions that I'd been taken to be confirmed. DO NOT spend a dime on this or anything this merchant sells."
2,9 months and it stopped working.,I purchased this flat iron at the end of Nov 2011. I was happy with the product overall but its been 9 months and the flat iron doesnt turn on. I previously had a cheap conair flat iron that lasted at least twice as long so I am not going to waste my money again on the CHI brand and am completely dissapointed with my one and only purchase of a CHI product. I will go back to the cheaper brands becuase at least I know what Im getting for my money.
2,Breaks Easily / Meh :(,"I don't flatiron often, so I wanted something that would be a long-term investment and when I first bought this iron, I was really impressed. But, after only a few months, I noticed the plates were cracked and the cord connection was damaged- and for a higher-end/pricier iron, it was kind of a let down (not to mention safety hazard). I've been using the old standby (Jilbere Ceramic-Tools 1-inch from Way Way BACK-IN-THE-DAY -- Now simply sold as Ceramic Hot Tools I think)and I think I'll stick to that for now, although I am considering purchasing a Solia in the future as/if the feedback is positive."
1,Chi Flat Iron?????,"I purchased this ""Chi"" flat iron thinking I was getting a great deal but when I plugged it in the light kept blinking on and off. It makes me wonder if there's a defect or it's a fake. I had to send back for a refund."
1,Short life Span,Loved the Chi when I got it. But would not turn on after only 2 months of use. Very disappointing. When it did work it was a nice iron.
4,Good for home flat iron,"I bought this one for a friend because I have one that I have used for more than 3 years. It is an excellent flat iron to use at home. It leaves my hair very shiny and soft. Better if it's used with a leave-in keratin, blow dry and then flat-iron."
1,Not good,I have used Chi flat irons and have been impressed. This one is cheaply made and doesnt close all the way on my hair. I had my old one fixed (also a Chi). Not sure whats up but this one isnt quality.
1,Didn't work when plugged in!,"This was my 2nd CHI. I bought the first one on Amazon and had it for about a year. Then out of no where it wouldn't turn on. I ordered another, used it once, and then it wouldn't turn on. I will never buy a CHI again."
2,Disappointed,I read several reviews prior to purchasing this product. When it worked it was wonderful but it stopped working after 5 uses. The light simply stopped coming on. I would not recommend buying this one. Sorry.
1,Ceramic flat hairstyling iron,"I bought the Farouk CHI 1"" ceramic flat hairstyling iron in October 2010 and it has now stopped working altogether. I used it only 2x/wk on short hair and unplugged it after each use. Next time, I'll keep the warranty."
1,Horrible,I purchased this product in December and in January it stopped working suddenly. I sent it back and received a new flat iron. This one worked great for about two months. It suddenly burned the tips of my hair and completely stopped working. I would never recommend this to anyone. It was a horrible purchase and ruined my hair.
1,Awful,Terrible it lasted about 2 weeks then wouldn't turn on. Trying to send it back but can't find the box
1,Knock off? I'd say so!,When I saw this Chi for 34.00 I had hesitations because of the cheap price. I went ahead and purchased it from this company without reading the reviews (and I always read reviews) lesson learned. The Chi lasted 3 weeks and now does not work. I emailed the company and have not received a response. Be aware that a great deal isn't a great deal if the product last you three weeks. Do not buy! I also do not know how this company is allowed to sell on Amazon.
3,"Worked great, until it stopped working",I expected more out of this straightener. It's a great name and a great product but the one I received lasted less than a year. I wish I could get a refund.
5,Finally!,"I already had a flat iron that I was happy with, but every time I go to get my hair cut, no matter where it is, the hair stylist always uses a Chi. Even though my current flat iron was a good brand, the results of the Chi were so much better. My hair never looked so straight and it felt so soft and smooth. After many years, I decided to purchase the Chi and it's great. After looking at youtube videos I found out you can even curl your hair with it. And it heats up very fast. No more waiting 20 minutes for my iron to get hot, now I can straighten it almost immediately after I turn it on. Great iron."
1,Sold me an imitation CHI,"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER. Seller sold me an imitation CHI flat iron. I was suspicious from the get-go when noticing that the product manual did contain any number to call for CHI product support. So I contacted them for a return label (there was no specific address on the package indicating where the product shipped from) and they said they would send a return label out that week. NEVER DID. Anyways, life went on and I forgot to follow up. Yesterday I came across the iron and decided to give it a try. Not only is the flat iron a total knock off but a CHEAPER THAN CHEAP knockoff at that! One of the iron plates fell out mid-styling, landing on my leg and severely burned me. Moral of the story: this seller is dishonest and the products they sell are budget knock offs----cheaply made and to be frank, dangerous. Do not buy from EVA."
5,WOW!,"This was an amazing straightener. On Amazon you can snag this for a great deal, too. I have very thick hair and every other straightener I have tried it takes me literal an hour or more to get it perectly straight. Tnis straihtener takes me 5 minutes, I am SO pleased with the order. This was definitley the best choice I have ever made when buying an item off of Amazon."
4,good,I love the flat iron. It works great I just hope it will last long. I haven't had any problems yet but I haven't had it for long. I know of them breaking.
4,Great product,"But even though the iron is ceramic, it will damage your hair, unlike my hair stylist claimed. Use with caution as the iron gets EXTREMELY HOT and it has no temperature control, only on and off switch which I learned to alternate off and on to keep it from getting too hot. It definately staightens your hair."
2,Wasn't impressed,"I bought this iron back in september due to all of the great reviews and recommendations from some of my coworkers but I wasn't impressed it didn't do that great of a job at straightening my hair and I only used it on a few sections of my hair and then I went back to my old flat iron, definitely not worth the 100.00,I sent it back pronto"
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"This was a great product until today when it stopped working. I used it off and on for months. The total use time was three months. I keep it in a nice place so it does not get messed up, but it already stopped working. You plug it in and it will not turn on. I checked several outlets and it still will not work. I am very upset after paying so much for it. I have purchased a cheap straightener before for less than $20.00 and they work for years. This is very upsetting. If the company could send me another one for free I would remove this review."
1,Terrible,"The price was great on this, but the quality was terrible. I have had it for under 3 months and it broke. It was plugged in to heat up when I came back to do my hair, the ceramic strips had popped loose and it was burning the counter. It will not turn on at all now. I was so disappointed because I have had great success with my previous Chi. I can't get my money back, and Chi will not honor the warranty when you purchase through Amazon. Moral of the story, pay the extra 30 bucks from an authorized dealer where you can be sure to get your 1 year warranty."
1,Works great...does not last!,"This is the best straightener I've ever used...I have naturally curly hair and no straightener ever took the frizz completely out until this one. The only downside: it is expensive and it breaks easily! I bought one that lasted a year, not too bad. The next one I bought only lasted a few months. Don't buy this straightener if you want your money's worth! It's so frustrating to finally find a great product and then have it break on you right away! I have learned my lesson..."
3,farouk,"I like this iron because its really easy to curl the ends of your hair. Just twist and go. I have struggled to get the hang out of my cheap flat iron for my wedge/bob hairstlye. Well, struggle no more! this iron is awesome and fast. It beats the 'cheapies' hands down. I also like it because it is thin! I thought not knowing better, using a larger iron would be easier, but not so. Its much easier to use this one. Plus... It comes in a limited edition pink style if you like that sort of thing"
3,New?,"Flat iron works fine, but did not appear to be in brand new shape. Would not make another purchase from this supplier."
3,Worked well for awhile...,"A great flat iron until one of the ceramic plates came off. It had barely been used and came off as I was straightening my hair. Amazon took it back, but charged a restocking fee. Considering all of the positive reviews, I must have just received a bad iron."
1,Not Happy,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. When she went to use it for the first time it did not work. I am trying to return it right now but I have not heard back from the company at this time.
1,FAKE - Don't buy,"My girlfriend wanted to buy a CHI hair straightener so we thought we'd trying buying one from Amazon for a good price. I've had good experiences before, so we thought it would be a pretty good bet that it would be fine. Big mistake. When we got it, we read through the papers it came with and found multiple spelling errors. The name of the city was even misspelled. We didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and reporting it because it still did the job. A couple tries into it, the whole thing broke. It no longer gets hot. So we will never order something like this from Amazon again."
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,"I purchased this for my sister-in-law for her Birthday. She was VERY excited to have received what is supposed to be a top of the line flat iron from CHI--a recognized brand. Unfortunately, it stopped working completely after only 3 days of her using it. It wouldn't even turn on whatsoever. Now I've had to go through the annoying process of filing for a return and packing up the flat iron and sending it back for a refund--and there is not another one available from the seller. Now I have to find a replacement birthday gift. Frustrating."
1,NO warranty if bought from AMAZON,Do not buy this product from Amazon. I had this item 2 months and it no longer works. Since Amazon has a 30 day return policy they wouldn't exchange it or anything. Farouk won't honor any warranty either if you buy it from any internet based business. Buy local don't buy from Amazon you will just get buyers remorse if the item breaks.
5,Chi flat iron,"This iron is the one that was most recommended and I so I knew exactly what I wanted. I just didn't want to pay the high price everyone else was asking. The price on Amazon was the best around. Amazon was also great about exchanging the 1st iron I received, which did not work. They quickly sent out a 2nd and it works wonderfully. I love the iron and I am thrilled with the service."
3,"Refurbished, though decent","It is cheap (it was discounted at $85 or so) but it is not new. I am unsure if mine was a unique case, but the iron I received had a few scratches and wear marks on it, though nothing really bad.It works fine, though I have not owned a truly new Farouk CHI so I have no real point of comparison. Just know that you may end up with a refurb and not a brand new model for this price."
2,Breaks and burns,"I got this CHI to replace my old one (which still worked pretty good) for this new one. I loved it and used it all the time and I noticed that it worked better than the old one. But then I was REALLY upset when I made a discovery.The thing broke after only a couple of weeks. Not like stopped working, but the heat panels that straighten your hair were coming off from the base. I realized this while I was using it and my hair slid under the panels and burned my hair. After that it was just came right off at the slightest touch. Thank goodness it was only one small section where it would go unnoticed. I plan on returning it the first chance I get. And if my replacement does the same, I will probably not purchase this one ever again.I love CHI but this particular straightener was of poor quality. And to me, quality overflashes quantity."
2,Works great while it lasts,"I don't know if this thing was real or fake (see other reviews), but while it lasted, it worked really well. It got my thick, wavy hair really straight, and in a reasonable amount of time. However, I had it less than a year, and used it only a couple times a month and it's already broken. It turned off in the middle of me using it, and won't turn on anymore. I definitely don't recommend it because of that. It's going to have to go in the trash."
2,Broke,"Honestly , the price wasn't bad & my payment was taken in a reasonable fashion & the product was shipped & received in a reasonable amount of time . This was a Christmas gift for my mom , & unfortunately within a month the product stopped working properly . When turned on it would shut off within a couple of minutes therefore making it of absolutely no use ."
1,Do Not Buy! It Stops working after a few months!,I bought the CHI flat Iron online 2 1/2 months ago! It stopped working for no apparent reason! The manufacturer does not guarantee this product if you buy it online. I would not suggest buying this item epecially after reading all the other reviews that this product stops working after a few months!
1,Not a good purchase,This flat iron broke after 2 months of getting it. I got a replacement which came defective. I never have a problem with amazon and I never return anything or recieve anything thats defective. This is by far the most difficult purchase I have had with Amazon.
1,Not real chi item,"I bought this chi for the price, thinking I'd get good quality. The straightener doesnt heat up to more then 30 at most, it isn't a regular chi product. Don't buy for $50 bucks,"
1,Horrible,"I bought this product as a birthday gift for my best friend. I received it 3 days before her birthday. She used it for 27 day before the circuit board fried and almost burnt her hair off. Of course, as it was the 31st day, I was unable to return it."
1,flat iron,"I am sorry to say, this flat iron did not even turn on. On the good size I was able to return it with ease. Amazon took care of the pickup."
2,Broke in less than a year!,"First of all, when I got this in the mail I immediately questioned if this was the ""real deal"". It had cheap white lettering stenciled on it that rubbed off easily, felt lightweight, and all around not up to par. But when I used it, it worked fine. Maybe not the incredible experience I've read about from CHI, but fine. Cut to less than a year later, and I plug it in to use one morning and it's dead as a doornail. For no reason. Wasn't dropped, didn't get wet, didn't get hot or cold, wasn't overused (about 1x a week), no power surge - just died. I'll pay the extra money for the real deal on this next order."
1,Fake,"I received a fake. A really good one at that. If you bought one and think it might be fake, look for an eBay article on how to spot a fake Chi -- they have pictures to compare. The one I received had a Made in China gray sticker and the wrong font for the Chi logo. The logo wasn't even red and was slanted. My seller was ""Blondie's Beauties"". Luckily Amazon issued me a full refund. Just keep in mind before purchasing it through Amazon, that you may receive a fake item. You can look online and pay about 20 or so more for an authentic one from other retailers with a year warranty; don't let the price suck you in."
3,Problems with shorting,"I have had three CHIs and all three have shorted. The first two were CHI Ultras and lasted about two years. The third was the orginial and lasted about 6 months. I took great care of the cord knowing the issues and yet they all still shorted. It was great while it lasted; heated up quickly and straightened easily. However, three CHIs within less than 5 years is a bit riduculous."
3,Decent flat iron,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. I have used it more than she has. I have a GHD for myselft that is a couple of years old. We both have very curly hair. When I initially straighten I use the GHD, and then I have been using the chi for the touch ups. It doesn't seem to work as well as the GHD, but it's decent enough."
5,Love it!,"I've been using this straightener for over a year now, and it's awesome! It leaves my hair super soft and smooth, and heats up quickly. It also doesn't cause any damage to my hair (I use a heat protectant with it, which probably helps). Even in fog, mist, and wind, which usually make my straightened hair really frizzy, it stays nice and straight. The price is pretty high, but if you're going to be using it more than once a week, I really think its worth it."
3,Heats up quickly.. but pulls my hair,This straightener is really good except that it pulls my hair more than the cheap one I own... I was pretty dissapointed especially since I have used other chi's and this did not happen.
4,"Works good, just wish it would heat up more.","This product straightens my hair pretty good, but it doesn't heat up as much as I would like it to. I don't know if this is just mine or if all of them are like this. My hair is wavy and not too thick and it takes around 10 minutes to straighten."
2,Not very happy,Doesn't work very well for thick hair doesn't get near hot enough! Waste of $$$$ will keep using my Centrix one
1,Very disappointed.,This is the most expensive flat iorn that I have bought and the worst performing. The Chi left my hair frizzy and damaged. I would give it a zero star rating if I could.
1,"Only worked once, then stopped!","I used this product once when I first received it. When I plugged it in to use a 2nd time, it wouldn't turn on. I tried every outlet in the house & sent it back. Beware."
1,Disappointing,I ordered this item and have used it less than 10 times and it no longer works. I have tried everything. It just wont turn on. Its a terrible product!!!!!
4,Chi flat iron is great,"The Chi 1 inch flat iron is great, it heats up fast. my hair is super curly and I only have to give it 2 passes and it's done and it doesn't take long."
1,FAROUK CHI,I THINK THIS MUST BE A KNOCK OFF AS THE HANDLE IS SO HOT YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD IT.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
1,Nice while it lasted,"I purchased this flat iron and used it on a daily basis for about 2 months until it completly stopped working out of nowhere. Nothing happened to it, it just stopped working randomly one day."
3,Quit working in 4 months,Product worked fine for 4 months - then quit working. There is no product warranty available if purchased online - and the return policy expired 45 days after purchase.
4,Good Product,"I'm OK with the product, the only issue is that is to narrow, would be better if it comes wider so I can straight more hair at a time"
5,Worth Every Penny,"This product is great! My previous flat iron broke. I wasn't too impressed with it, so I started asking around and found that most women mentioned Chi and how great it is. I decided to give it a try. Ohmigosh! I couldn't believe the results the first time I used it! In fact, the day mine arrived I had washed my hair and then just pulled it in to a ponytail while still damp. I figured the ponytail ""bump"" would be a great test - and it got rid of if with no problem! This works so well that I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. It glides through the hair effortlessly. It's also important to me that it doesn't weight a lot since I have a problem with recurring shoulder/back pain so I like that it works fast and I don't end up in pain after daily styling. Get one!"
3,Chi Straight Iron,I have had a Chi straight iron before and love them. This one almost didn't seem lke a Chi. It keeps pulling my hair out and doesn't get as hot as the one I had previously although it is the same exact model.
5,Love This Product,"Prior to purchasing this item, I had an inexpensive flat iron that produced mediocre result. The first time I used the CHI flat iron, the results were like night and day. I have stubborn hair that has many cowlicks which are hard to straighten; the Farouck CHI, however, had no problem taming my hair. With my old flat iron I would have to go over each piece of hair several times, which is both time consuming and bad for your hair. When using the Farouk CHI, however, just one swoop over each section of hair completely straightened it--quick and easy. I love this product, and would highly recommend it."
1,It been used,"I didn't expect to receive a used item , that i been buy it as knew . It have some scratches on the bar and does close very well . It was bad item"
2,Not that great for all the hype,"Although the Amazon price for this CHI flat iron was very good compared to retail, I ended up returning the item. I did not think it worked much better than my previous, cheaper irons to justify the price increase. I ended up getting a more expensive, digital,tourmaline professional flat iron of a lesser known brand, and I am extremely satisfied."
2,Okay quality,I just bought this iron because the special edition model that I got for Christmas stopped working. So far so good. The only thing I was not happy with is the quality of the iron. It is far more lighter than the others and it looks very dull. I would have to say the coating is 100% plastic. So be careful and not drop it because it will crack maybe even break a piece off somewhere.
1,Burn it Up!,"I wouldnt recommend this flat iron for someone with chemically treated hair. My hair has been chemically trated for some time now, and ive used several brands and types of flat irons. But this flat iron would simply fry your hair if its not natural. This flat iron does wonders for the un-chemically treated hair, but it literally burned my hair, because it was extremely too hot and there is no way to change the settings, or lower the heat."
1,"I ordered a new one, but got a refurbished one!!!","I was so excited to see that amazon was able to give me a better price than what ulta was selling it for, so I bought it. When I opened my package, I was under the impression that I was going to get a new one. But instead I got a refurbished one, so I returned it and to be safe bought a NEW one from Ulta."
1,Disappointed,"Everyone has told me this is the flat iron to get, so I was pretty excited to see it at such a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the iron I ordered would not turn on when plugged in, so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. The second one arrived with the same problem. Amazon has been great in handling the return process, but the product has been a real disappointment. I guess I'll buy that expensive model at my salon instead. Beware!"
1,Burns Hair,"This item does not have a dial to adjust temperature, just an on and off switch. It burned my hair. I would not recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I would have put zero stars if possible. I have had this straightener for 10 months and it worked perfectly at first but now it does not work. Apparently, the warrenty is void if ordered of Amazon, so if you want this straightener DO NOT BUY OFF OF HERE. It is very frusterating to buy something you feel like you have barely had and have it break. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Check other sites, they have the same prices but are much easier to work with. I will never be purchasing a Chi again."
1,I love my Chi... NOT ANY MORE,"I bought this Chi to replace the one I fried. It's just as great and I love it. It came really quickly and works wonders._____UPDATE_______I bought this chi less than a year ago to replace the one I had for almost 3 years. However, this one just stopped working, out of no where, and though there is a year warranty, it doesn't apply to products ordered online. I'm so disappointed, I was literally in love with my Chi. Based on other reviews I think I'm going to go with a sudu or solia next time.Be careful with this product, you may be shelling out good money only to have to spend it again in less than a year."
1,Meltdown,"I ordered this flat iron for my daughter. She used it about 5 days before it overheated and melted all the plastic causing the plates to even come off. After researching, my suspicion is that it was a fake??"
1,Not happy,This straightner only worked for one month. Bought as a Christmas present for my mom. emailed company with no response! Will not buy from again!! Very unsatisfied and sad that this happened!
2,Not worth it.,"No temperature control and is always super hot. The ceramic ""flat"" parts do not come together perfectly. My hair gets snagged quite often. Build quality feels cheap compared to similarly priced products.This was my first flat iron and I loved it at first when I bought it three years ago. I tried other similarly priced flat irons and this one has been in storage ever since."
1,save your money..,"I ordered it a little over a week before Christmas, and it came after the fact. It doesn't have a temperature switch. Usually CHI flat irons take me 10 minutes to straighten my hair and this one takes at least double, it is not a real CHI. I can't return it now cause I've had it for over a month. I had the CHI turbo and it works wonders, but after 5 years it started not working. This ""chi"" straightener is horrible for the price I paid for it. I could probably go to walmart and get a better one for 25 dollars. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants the quality of a CHI flat iron. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Farouk Chi i Inch Ceramic Flat Iron,Works well. Wish It had a little curve in the plate so shorter hair would curl under at ends.
4,Good product but...,Good product but do not use outside the US if the voltage requires to be stepped down (w/ transformer) from 220v to 110v. The CHI will melt in your hand!!! Otherwise my wife loves it...The second one...
5,Perfect!,I LOVE my CHI iron. It's absolutely perfect and soooo worth the money. I had a cheap one I bought at Target but it didn't really straighten my hair at all and I just have wavey hair. Absolutely worth the money.
4,Gotta love straight hair!,"I've been very pleased with this flat iron. It heats up quickly and does the job well, although you have to take the time to do sections of your hair one at a time. You can't put too much hair in at once. Also, you need to use it on dry hair only or you'll just be wasting your time. The only downfall I have found is that there is no automatic shutoff so be careful and make sure you turn it off/unplug!"
4,CHI..!,"Not as impressed..! Can reach up to 400 degrees and ruin your hair. You MUST buy the hairspary in order not to ruin your hair. Overall, it does the job, but the Ceramic Straightner my Aunt brought at the mall works wayy better."
4,Four stars,"Very satisfied with the iron, although, I don't know what all the hype is with having a Chi. They are so much more expensive than irons that you can buy in your local store, yet they only work a little better. Is it really worth spending the money?"
1,Dont waste your money!,"After just 3 months of 2x weekly use, the hair straightener has stopped heating up and I am unable to contact anyone at Hairpro. I have never had an item just stop working like this before! Do not waste your money!!!! Shop elsewhere! The seller is not able to be contacted once they have your money!!"
1,Product did not work,Do not recommend this product. It didn't work. I didn't open it right away and when I opened the package was a couple of weeks after I received it. I'm pretty much stuck with it.
4,Works really well,"I get bored with my hair and like to change my look now and then when I have time and am in the mood. I dont want to do curls every day fo the week. A helpful hint: use Shiny Serum or someting similar on your hair when you are done. It really adds to the shine I have fairly long hair and live in a warm climate most of the year. My stylist first used this on me and then I bought one.It really is great! My hair is nice a straight and shiny, and stays that way unless it gets wet or more than 2 days pass."
2,Overpriced,"My husband and I have been using a cheap $20 Revlon (from Target) iron for a few years. It still works, and it does nearly as good of a job as this overpriced ($70+) equivalent. In fact, the construction of the CHI's plastic parts is not as good as the Revlon. I think the iron part of the CHI might work a touch better than the Revlon, but not enough to justify the price. I was hoping to reduce the number of times I have to iron each strand of hair, but I haven't seen much improvement by paying more."
3,Not sure if I like this product...,"This product is pretty good, considering the fact that it looks like its gonna break within 50 uses. Seriously though, from all the reviews from amazon raving about how great this product is, it definitely, DENFINITELY looks really cheap. I would expect this kind of product to be sold for 35 dollars, not even, from Target or Walmart. It has no temperature control but it adjusts temperature by itself. The LED light blinks by itself most of the time which is nerveracking because I don't know when it's gonna break or not work or have temperature malfunction. Good thing about this product is that it heats up VERY QUICKLY! within 4 minutes tops! but the architecture of the product leaves me wondering if its sturdy enough for it to last me for long compared with the price im paying. I really like it but I'm going to return this because it looks like its gonna break soon. Design is not well thought out."
1,Broke within one week.,This iron worked well for one week and then ceased to work. horribly unreliable product. Do not buy!!!!!!
3,Not Sure,"I've used many Chi flat irons in the past and I question if this one is authentic. The first time I used it, I heard a pop come from it which triggered the automatic shut off. I haven't had a problem with that since. The name on the outside of the Chi flat iron Global Beauty has almost completely rubbed off, which none of my other Chi's did and I don't feel like it's doing as good of a job in straightening my hair as the other Chi's I used. It's okay, but I'm seriously considering buying another one from a more reputable place that I trust and spending a little more for it."
4,Great Tool for Perfect Hair,"The humidity in Georgia can be murder on your hair, and you can forget having a smooth look if you have one bit of body in your hair. I was born with hair that was ""straight as a board,"" and very thick. Over the years, it has gained more and more body.The Chi is excellent in taming any wave, without frying or damaging your hair. It heats up quickly, and allows you to get close to the scalp without threat of burning (like with curling irons).4 stars because I find the cord to be a tad short for my needs."
1,bad wiring,"The iron was goofy from the beginning. Sometimes, it would turn on, sometimes now. Now, after three months, it no longer turns on and Amazon's return window is 30 days. For a high-end price, this is very disappointnig."
2,Cord Breaks frequently,"While the flat works, I only used it 2-3 times per month for a few months and now it won't receive a charge. I've read on many sites that this is a frequent problem and I can't get it replaced or fixed by Farouk without a fee. Choose another vendor that has a better warranty or track record."
5,It is the best FLAT IRON.......like no other.,I love this flat iron! It is so easy to use and it works fast.....so YES it is well worth the money! My hair is wavy but after using this my hair stays silky straight! I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a good flat iron!
4,Chi,I'm happy to have found a great product at a more affordable price that what other websites and salons were selling it for. A little more costly than most straightners but well worth it if you frequently straighten your hair and want to guard against heat damage. I also recommend pairing is with a heat sheilding spray.
2,Farouk CHI doesn't deliver,"Unfortunately the on/off switch did not consistently work, despite resetting several times. I have read good reviews about this product so I'm hoping this is just a product glitch on the one particular iron as I have re-ordered same model. Amazon has been prompt in addressing concern and a new flat iron is in the mail as I write."
5,Excellent for any type of hair!,"The CHI 1 Inch Cermaic Flat Iron is great for anyone that has somewhat unruly hair. I have hair a little above my elbows and the 1 inch works perfectly! I can curl or straight my hair with this tool, and even in the VA humity my hair continues to stay styled throughout the evening. This is worth the money!!! I am very happy. It is as advertised."
3,Just OK.. quick shipping though! :),"Quick shipping, got a crummy DELL case for the laptop, pictures are not the same as posted. The memory was not erased when received. But what can you expect for $149 for a mac? This apple g4 is great for watching movies, the programs are not downloaded such as word, or flash player."
5,Great ideas,Martha has done it again. There are so many unique ideas that get lots of compliments when they are used! The book has menus for almost any type of entertaining that one might want to do.
4,A nice bike,"After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure if this is the bike for me. After six months of riding and shopping around, I can say ""it is a nice bike"". Under $200, my options are limited and this fits my budget well.It arrived without a scratch or dent. I took it to a superstore on the back seat of my car and got it assembled for $20. He assembled it a bit fast and I so had to take it again for adjustmenting seat height and raising the handle bar which I could have done it myself. After that, wow what a pleasure it is to ride the bike.I haven't had any problem so far and I ride on bike trails 10 miles at a time. I got a basket from a hardware store for $10 and it fit exactly on the carrier. Now, I take it for shopping as well. Nice way to save on gas, keep the environment clean and get fit. Hybrid bike is another option I considered, but not sure if I would have got a carrier or comfortable seat like this one does."
4,Columbia Mens bike,"Yes, it came without instructions, but putting it together was not that hard. A kick stand would have been nice, but it is a really high quality and well designed bike for the money."
2,Shipping and Handling,After reading all of the positive reviews for this bike I was very excited about receiving it. When it arrived I took the bike out of the box and the rear tire was bent so bad that the rim was crack. The box that it came in was a light weight cardboard. There was no wood frame or even Styrofoam for added protection.The picture shows a green bike my came blue??? It was a nice dark blue but I was expecting green
3,Meh.,"(1) The 20-inch frame is actually 26x20, and is too large for me (I am 5'10"").(2) Assembly was not rocket science, however ...I was 2 miles into a 4-mile ride this afternoon. I shifted gears for a hill, and the gear change mechanism moved into the path of the rear wheel spokes, bringing the bike to a sudden and untimely halt. Various parts were entangled. I spent 20 minutes on the side of the road re-positioning bent and broken metal so I could push what was left of my bike home.If you're going to buy a bike on Amazon, I strongly suggest you take it to a bike shop for adjustments and a safety inspection after you've assembled it. If you insist on doing what I did (i.e. figuring it out on your own), be sure to spend some time making sure everything is properly adjusted. I'm not the most mechanically inclined person, but neither is the average consumer buying a bicycle online.Overall, not a bad bike for $200. I wish I could have gotten more than 15 minutes of riding out of it."
3,disapointed,BIKE CAME WITH NO ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS. HAD TO BRING IT TO A BIKESHOP FOR ASSEMBELY. HE TOLD ME THE AXEL WAS LOOSE AND HAD TO BE PRESSEDON. THE BOLTS HOLDING IT ON THE FRONT WHEEL NEVER WERE TIGHTENED. THESEAT IS UNCOMFORTABLE COMPAIRED TO MY OTHER BIKE. I SPENT A LOT AT THEBIKE STORE TO GET IT USABLE. I WILL ONLY BUY FROM A BIKE STORE IN THEFUTURE. I CAN THEN TRY IT AND CHECK THE BIKES CONDITION .THE TIME AND$80.00 AT THE BIKE SHOP ELIMINTED THE COST SAVINGS ON THE INTERNET.
4,Gene Kelly's work is truly timeless.,"I cannot think of a star with more charisma, personality and likeable charm than Gene Kelly. He was known for his danceing, but Gene was an accomplished singer as well. BEST OF GENE KELLY highlights some of the most wonderful moments of his career. I found myself grinning and singing along with ""Love is here to Stay"" and ""Moses Sopposes"". If you are a fan of Gene's work on the screen, make BEST OF GENE KELLY a part of your music collection."
3,Beware,"Tantalizing - Copyright 1999 by Lori Foster. His Every Fantasy Copyright 2003 by Janelle Danison. Playmates Copyright 2004 by Chris Marie Green. Yeah, it's nice for people who have not read these old stories to have them repackaged, but let the buyer beware. I KNEW they all sounded familiar, and at original price of $12.95, they just weren't good enough to read again."
3,Disappointing season,"Yeah probs not gonna continue to watch this show anymore, not interesting to me anymore. Would prefer the original diva"
2,Delayed Why?,"Why is it that other sources like ITunes can have videos up the next day, but Amazon can't? (I loathe Itunes/Apple and refuse to buy from them) I can't get Rupual Drag Race because I have a crappy conservative cable company so I always have to get it online. I have been coming here for episodes in the past, but lately it is taking 2-3-4 days to get the most recent episodes posted here. Very frustrating. Normally I would rate the series a 5 star, but this is getting ridiculous at this point even trying to view the series!"
2,Not as good as regular Drag Race,"Let's face it..this show was the most deliberately contrived show of all the work RuPaul has done. The pairings weren't ""random"" on the first episode, they were too perfectly set up to make ""great TV"". And we all know reality shows are manipulated by the producers but this show didn't even try to hide the fact.NOT Ru's best work, which is sad because the othe Drag Race shows are really pretty good. This one just didn't live up to those standards"
1,Could be better,This pie had a homemade flair to it so I was expecting delicious homemade flavor. I was disappointed with this particular product and thought it not to tasty.
4,Silent and functional,"The high point of this switch is that it's PoE but silent. Ours is powering 6 toshiba IP telephone handsets. It did have one glitch in the first week where it needed to be power cycled (indicators on the switch indicated a fault for all ports.) but since then, it's been on for two months without a problem.The low: PoE is only available on the first 8 ports. and there is no management of this switch: no QoS, no remote monitoring, &c.; I've heard the specs don't provide for full PoE wattage to each of the 8 ports either, but it's fine for 8 of our IP handsets."
5,It will allow you to glow from within! Ten Stars **********,"At one point in my life everything was awful. I felt literally like a turtle on it's back; not able to do anything. I had no energy. I started doing this book twice a day and the results were truly amazing. My aura now glows. This book might seem redundant...it is not. Everything from the information to the practice is necessary and like I said phenomenal. With my busy schedule now I still make it a point to practice this book once a week. If I should miss, I feel the difference. Plus during the day if I get angry or whatever I surround myself with ""the gold protective bubble"". Connect to Mother, Father God. And down ray the orange-red, then blue-white flames. I seal the energy and give thanks. And it is truly wonderful. Thank you Barbara Martin and Dimitri Moraitis for writing this amazing book."
4,cool,"Interesting book, with fun ideas to play with. written well, easy to read - not too far out there or to basic. Using the ideas/ methods have brought interesting and positive changes to my attitude and the people around me."
3,Books with awesome illustrations of human energy,"This is one of several books out there that give pictures you can see of what energy really looks like. This book is very focused on color and what the colors of the auras mean. I find it very useful to see actual illustrations. Add this to the list - check out Barbara Brennan (the perennial guide) with Hands of Light - great pictures; that new book Energetic Anatomy with the great cover illustration (by Mark Rich) and the lush interior black and whites - these two books have the best illustrations I've seen. and of course Alex Grey rocks too, though I don't know how accurate his pictures are."
5,What a life changer!,"I've read this book and her other two: The Healing Power of Your Aura and Karma and Reincarnation--and they are incredible blessings! Easy daily practice of these meditations will change your life for the better. A true gift from the Higher. Don't take my word for it, check it out for yourselves. Thank you Barbara and Dimitri for these wonderful gifts."
5,EVERY FREE MINUTE,"Back in 2007, I was searching for a good AURA book. Something as a beginner as I was well deep into my religious beliefs and making that transition to learning outside of my ""so called"" box. This is a great book for beginners and advance knowledge. I was so fascinated with this book that I used it almost every FREE second I had to meditate with it. It made me feel good and I felt very grounded and centered. Amazing wonderful things has happened to me when I use it. You should try it if you are a beginner introducing yourself to meditation, healings and just getting your feet wet to this type of ideas. It's a good base. It will be easy for you to wrap your head around it."
3,I'm sure they will work fine,"Unfortunately I had to return the two that I purchased as they were bought together, and one had a crack in the top of it. I originally said I'd just seal it with some silicone, but after careful consideration, and seing how thin they were, I returned both. I'm sure they would have served the purpose that they were made for, but I have a feeling that since they were thin, and had no reinforcements around the fastener holes, that they would fail at a considerably quick rate. I would suggest to Camco that they at least reinforce the fastener holes. Other than that, and one being already cracked, they, like I said above, would probably work fine for awhile."
1,Too Small,Just purchased and mounted two of these and can't open or close my vents without them catching on the screen frame of the Camco. The Maxxair I mounted first fits fine but is one inch longer. Why Camco would cheap out on one inch of material is hard to understand. I have tried to adjust them but no luck. Not happy with the product at all.
5,vent,"easy to install,great price, fast shipping,i like the front it because you can take it off so you can clean your endside screen"
5,Easy to install!!!!! Great price!!!!,"Great Product at a great price.Installed two of them on top of my travel trailer in about twenty minutes.I had a set of brackets missing in one vent cover,I e-mailed Amazon and had one two days later,good service.I really like where you can take the vent off to clean the cover all in all great price,easy to install,and great product!!!!"
4,great buy,"Solved my problem. easy installation, attaches to existing frame with side brackets, so in effect it kind of mounts just above the rubber roof with no holes in the roof. leave your vent open in any weather with no worry of leaking. it is very light in weight."
5,Must have for roof vents,Keeps out the rain as advertized and allows you to leave the roof vent open in all weather. This is a must have for folks in the South where a stored RV can get real hot inside. Leaving the vent open allows ventilation on hot days in storage. Intallation was simple. Make sure you test vent door clearance before you drill the holes.
3,Check out the dimensions of your rooftop vent frame!,"Was a real problem mounting the Camco Vent Covers!Had to mount the back brackets on a rounded corner because the shortest distance between front and back Camco mounting holes was so far apart! A bit more than 9"".Other than that only time will tell if the mounting struggles were worth the effort!When checking if your original rv vent will open and close properly with the Camco Cover installed make sure you tighten all mounting bolts. i did not and it caused me to have to go up and down the rv ladder a few times before i figured things out. The original rv vent would open and close but then when i fully tightened the bolts it would not."
4,"Good Value, Easy to Install","This vent cover is superior to others that I've used, due to the removable screen on the cover opening that prevents debris from entering the cover and winding up on the top of the ceiling-mounted screen. No more leaves, small sticks or insects sitting in plain view.Installation was easy, just attach the sheet metal tabs to the vent surround (drilling required),then attach the cover to the tabs. There is plenty of adjustment capability, no need to worry about getting the cover square before drilling.After installation the vent will open about 40 degrees; not as fully as without the cover, but sufficient for good ventilation.The only question is how well the cover will stand up to NM's high UV environment. If I knew it would last at least 5 years, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Good product at the right price,"This is a good, basic vent cover. It is easy to mount with the supplied hardware. And it comes with a removable section so you don't have to buy an extra mounting kit to get easy access to clean the vent underneath. I ordered Camco screen door slides and vent insulators at the same time, and got free shipping from Amazon, a major savings."
3,No hardware included!,We have not yet installed this. The main reason being that no hardware was supplied with it as stated in the description. The instructions also seem somewhat confusing but maybe if you actually had the hardware that it is referring to it would be easier to understand.
3,Knitters Unite,"A collection of thoughts, poems and essays on knitting with an occasional pattern thrown in. Fun and light reading for the most part, but beware -- there's more than one tear-jerker contained within!"
5,Mike Riera is a the best in his field,"Mike Riera writes about teens in a way that demonstrates his incredible respect for them. He helps us to take teens seriously, and not to dismiss their behavior as simply ""dramatic"" or ""a stage.""He is truly gifted, as a writer and a professional working with teens and families. He is thoughtful, real, and accessible to parents and to teens. I use his work everyday to inform my own work with teens, and his books are an incredible resource to offer to parents."
5,"Great for the teen, even better for the parent","I have recommended this book to every parent I know of a teen or preteen. It not only provides tips and ""tricks"" for setting up communication opportunities, but also really helps parents to not take certain teen behaviors personally. The rules change when our kids become teens. This book is a great resource for the ""new"" person you find living in your child's room. THANK YOU, Mr. Riera for writing this book and sharing your insight."
5,Teenagers!!!,"Very good book. Full of information & examples of how to communicate with your teenager. I initially found this book at the library & checked it out. After reading it once, I decided I need to have my own copy for reference. This has been a good investment."
4,Fantastic book,"This book has a lot of great insight about teenagers so parents will have a better perspective of what teenagers are going through. It has a lot of practical examples and addressing issues concerning both boys and girls. I would highly recommend this books for parents with teens and would give 5 stars for the book itself. However, the delivery of the book was beyond the promising period, may be it's due to the distance and the weather."
4,Science and the Making of the Modern World,"I read this book as a requirement for an upper division class in college. This book pulled together everything that I'd been learning: science, art, philosophy, politics. It broadened my view point and showed me that scientific discoveries, philosophical views, art movements--everything we, as people, do influences something or someone else."
3,For beginners and intermediate,This book suits nice for people tying to either lern turkish or going to Turkey as a turist. The book consists of several turkish phrases and their translation in Turkish. I looked at the book and thougt that it wasn't any good (to simple) but my friend trying to learn turkish said that this book has been very helpful to her in her studies. She said that she needed a lot of phrases in order to grasp the order of words in the turkish language (which comes natural to me). So if this book can help out confused 'non native' speakers it will have to do as a learning book.
1,Save some cash and just put 50 cents in a gum machine!,"My daughter purchased the OTHER Labyrinth necklace from Dan's Jewelry, and after waiting almost a month on the item I was very disappointed. It was shiny in the picture I saw, but the pendant that arrived was of dull sheen and contained many flaws--scratches, indentations, miscolorings. Overall, the piece was of gumball machine quality. My daughter still liked the necklace, but she loves gumball machine jewelry. You should save the $9 plus shipping if you are expecting more."
5,Passed my test with this book!,"I really like this brand of test prep. I now only purhcase this brand because every time I do, I pass the tests! I find that the prep tests are most closely related to what is actually on the tests!"
4,Good study aid,"I used this guide to prepare for the PEd test, and passed it the first time. This guide had helpful practice tests so I could see where I was weak. The sample tests were more challenging for me than the actual exam."
5,A Very Good Buy,"I passed the test on Jan. 30, 2009 using this book. The overviews of each chapter were helpful and the two practice test were good too. This is the book you should buy if you want to pass the Professional Education Test."
4,Good Test Prep,"I have two other guides for this test and this was the most accurate. It is not as easy to read as some of the others. Type is smaller, but it is very comprehensive. The only thing that would be nice with this book is a test on disc since the tests are all computerized now. I took the test on July 27th and passed. It is nice to get instant results at the testing facility. If I were you I would get to know your buddy Bloom and Good Luck!"
4,Great Aid,"I took the professional exam today (6/6/12), Cliff notes is the best study tool you can use for the Professional Exam. Many of scenarios that were from the test were similar to the test. However, the wording of the responses on the test may confuse you. The book does great in explaining the competencies and provides examples. I passed the test :)"
5,A good value.,"Just took the Prof Ed Exam. I'm totally new to teaching so I was pretty worried. This book is the only thing I used to study. Passed it on the first try. I've tried the XAM books and the Cliffs Notes books on a few of my certifications and I've found the XAM books to be helpful (despite some nasty reviews on Amazon), but I find the Cliffs books to be slightly more helpful and, more importantly, they are WAY CHEAPER. The price is probably due to the amount in circulation as it seems they only publish the major tests (I can't find one for most of my SAE's). For the price, this book was solid. I studied it for about a week, took the practice tests and then studied those and passed first try.If they had books for all of the exams I need to take, I'd use them exclusively, but for now I shell out more $$ to get the XAM books which are a slight step down in quality."
5,All you need,"This is the only book you need to study for the Professional Education test. If you aren't an education major, you will find it extremely helpful. The two practices tests more than prepared me for the real thing. Very thorough explanations as to why the correct response is indeed the correct response. As another review noted, it did not contain information on school vouchers or school choice, but that is only way it is lacking. Those are pretty straighforward topics that one could ""guess"" accurately given a multiple-choice format."
3,Disappointingly written and edited,"This book appears to me to be very poorly edited, with numerous clerical and scientific errors. For instance, multiple sclerosis is termed a ""neurogenerative"" disease rather than a ""neurodegenerative"" disease. The writing includes some of the longest sentences I've ever seen in scientific writing, and not to the author's benefit. The authors repeat themselves quite a bit from one chapter to the next. Disappointing!"
2,Not for peeing,"I used this thing just once so far. The bags it comes with DO NOT HOLD WATER. I plopped down on the ""seat"", peed, and it came RIGHT THRU the bag!!! Looking forward to the Luggable Loo"
3,Would be nice if it had a lid,"I bought this because I can't stand squatting. The bags will slip off after a little weight so, probably best to poke a hole in the bag so it slowly drains (and doesn't splash on your feet). I really would have liked it if it had a lid on it since the bugs like to get up in that thing with a quickness. It's not fun sitting on a bag of bugs! Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do and is sturdy enough to hold me at 180 pounds."
1,For Kids ONLY,"I reviewed this product, as usual, prior to purchase. From the reviews I thought it might be a good buy-- WRONG-- this 'portable camp toilet' would be perfect for the kids or a N.Y. model weighing less than a 100lbs and for no one with a butt circumference larger than a saucer plate! I sent it packing back to Amazon which has an outstanding return policy. My advice, look at something, anything else (unless it's for the kids)!"
3,Great for Camping,"I bought this to use during camping trips. Easy to setup, comes with a couple of bags. Not sure where to get extra bags. Collapes to a very small size."
2,Not so hot,"This looked like a well-designed camp toilet with a convenient disposal bag system and a nice stand just the right height off the ground. Problem: the so-called snap ring that is supposed to hold the bags in place, is flimsy and doesn't work. With this fundamental element not dependable, or even functional, all you have is the bag. Good luck with that."
4,better than popping a squat,This toilet is sturdy & comfortable. We don't bother with the bags when just peeing. I gave it only 4 stars cause when I got food poisoning I was not trying to mess around with a bag so I just made my way to a porter can (thank goodness they were clean!)
1,waste of money,"I purchased this item. The bag does not stay secure, and the toilet is not sturdy. I am not a large personand my bum barely fit on it.Dont waste your money"
5,Awesome product!!!,"This the best $16 I have spent in a long time. I bought this product for my medical mission trip to Haiti and loved it. Compared to the ""bathroom facilities"" in Haiti, this was the best thing I had with me. It was easy to assemble and unassemble. It served it's purpose well. My roomies were quite happy with my purchase too. I would highly recommend purchasing this product. It is inexpensive, lightweight and fits quite nicely in my check-in luggage."
5,Potty was great!!,"This was awesome! We just camped this past weekend. We have a large 3-room tent and put this in the corner furthest from the bed. Used it every night - so convenient!!! We were not too near the bathhouse and it was freezing outside so to just hop up, use it, and hop back into bed...priceless!! Very durable, had no issues whatsoever. Bags are durable too. This will come with us every time now!"
1,Too small for adult use,Cheked on Amazon and it looks ok. Ordered and received promtly. Opened it up and found out it is too small for adult use.
5,This book is in my 'Keep These' list,"This book works for so many different levels and for so many applications, it's a must have for me.I make a point of reading it at least once a year. I've got a hard copy and now one on my iPad, lovely book to 'dip into' whenever I have some time.I bought this book initially to improve sales, but it has affected every area of my life."
1,Did not like,"I purchased this book because it was listed in a nurse practitioner journal, and I am a nurse practitioner as well. Both my husband and I felt like much of the advice in this book went against our instincts as kind and loving parents. I believe my husband threw the book out after he read something about locking a child in their bedroom if he or she would not stay there. I agree with the reviewer who stated some of the 5 star reviews seem phony."
2,Not for us.,"After the author told me to withhold affection when my child misbehaved, I lost interest and faith in where this book was going. This just wasn't for us."
5,Great Cookware for the Money,"We bought these to replace an older Circulon set. My wife really loves them, easy to clean up, sturdy, stylish, good gripping handles that stay cool. Do not make the mistake with any of these of cleaning them in a dishwasher. Our only complaint was that there was not a 12 inch skillet but we bought a 10/12 combination set separately and that solved the issue. Highly recommended for the value they provide."
4,Cookware,The Analon Advanced cookware is super. It distributes the heat evenly and cleans very easily. The only drawback is that is is rather heavy compared to most cookware.
4,Anolon Cookware Set,High quality cookware. The only thing I found that I didn't like is that you can't use high heat with the sauce pans or stock pots. Takes a very long time to boil water for pasta etc when using medium heat. Glad I kept my stainless steel set.
5,Must-have cookware,"We purchased this set a month ago and are totally impressed with it. It has replaced all the pots and pans we have had simply because after cooking in these, we just don't want to bother with the others.I was a little apprehensive about the fact that since it is non-stick and you're not supposed to use high heat, I will have a problem with browning meat and such. But, I was wrong. This cookware does an excellent job of browning without having to resort to high heat and you don't have to constantly watch over it to prevent burning.As others have said, you actually see a difference in your cooking - for the better.It is completely worth the price and I will definitley be buying more Anolon cookware in the future."
5,Outstanding Value!!!,"I purchased the 12-piece Anolon Advanced cookware set as a last second gift for my wife. Sometimes she doesn't understand the value in buying a quality product. I was about to buy this same set for nearly twice the price but got it for $199!! When we received it, she and her mother that was in town, absolutely loved the look, quality, variety and how smooth and evenly it cooked. It cleaned extremely easy, too! I would highly recommend this Anolon cookware to any and everyone!"
5,can't say enough good things about these!!!!,"Those are great quality cookware. I use them on a daily basis and could not be happier with them. What I appreciate the most is that nothing sticks to the bottom of these, no even boiling milk. In the past, I'v used caphalone, but heating milk on a stove always follows tough cleaning of the pot afterwards. With these, the burned milk on the bottom simply lifts off as one piece with a rinse of water."
3,My 0.02 after owning this set for 3 years,"This has been a great starter set for me to get into cooking, however I wished I had waited and just bought some individual pieces. I pretty much only use the 12 skillet and the 2 quart saucepan and everything else stays in the cupboard. The quality of the pieces is very high, but I deducted a few stars because the usefulness of the set is minimal, I don't really need 3 sauce pots and replacing the middle one with a saucier or general purpose pan would have been made is more versatile for me."
5,BEST COOKWARE EVER!!!,"I received this product after about 4 years of using Target's T-fal product. I immediately noticed a difference in my food, the way it cooked and tasted. The soft grip handles are a dream. It was definitely the best deal out there. I have used my dad's Calphalon before and this is far better. A definite must."
5,This was a really great deal!,"I saw this exact item at Bed Bath and Beyond for $399. Came home and found it on Amazon for $269 with free shipping. Amazing!Love the set. It's a great combination of qualities. The handles are coated so they never get hot. The lids are glass so you can see inside the pots. Non-stick surface, terrific. They are a little heavier than my old set but the big pots have two handles.Highly recommended!"
2,Good evocation of Paris but story-line poor.,"I was attracted to this book due to the fact that I live near Paris at present.Although the descriptions of the city are very accurate,the story-line relating to the disappearance of Valentina is unbelievable and due to this I feel it only merits 2 stars.This book is not as good as other works I have read by Rose Tremain and is really quite disappointing."
4,elegantly done,"a book is about young boy is going to search a french lady who was suddlenly vanished. well done and her sentense make you feel like you are in France. this book contains also a little romance, suspense and process of one boy become to man. 4 stars of recommendation!"
1,The Way I Found Her,"If asked to suggest a great/good book, this would not be on my list. I found some of the dialogue unbelievable. Perhaps my dislike for this book had something to the main character (13-year-old Lewis) and his actions throughout the novel -- half the time I was disgusted with him -- he was at times arrogant, rude to his mother (even if she was distant), and even worse fantasizing and eventually doing inappropriate things with a woman who was older than his own mother. In the end, I simply was not impressed with the writing. 5 years from now this book will be long forgotten from my memory."
2,So much potential,"I really wanted to like this story, but Ms. Tremain just didn't get what being a teenage boy was like and I kept getting caught up in the fact that this was sexual abuse from an older women. I guess it is okay for women to have sex with underage guys in Ms. Tremain's mind."
3,This is a 13 year old boy?,"Although well written, I was a bit disappointed. The second half of the book was fairly unimaginative. Also, the musings and reflections of Lewis just did not seem like the thoughts of a 13 year old boy. I know the author had a vision of a unique child character in mind, but I could never buy into it."
4,Better than any crime-attorney-trial- novel!,"I'm glad The Wash. Post reviewed this a couple of months ago or I would never have known of this treasure. Young or old, male or female, this tale is for anyone who was ever imaginative or adventuresome in their younger days. Besides suspense, it creates the mood of present day Paris and will have you wishing you spoke French or promising yourself a trip there someday (you can almost smell the croissants). The ending was surprising, but fitting for such an intelligent and dramtic novel. I would not be surprised to hear that someone has bought the movie rghts. Rose Treamin is definitely an addition to my ""favorites"" list."
5,A strange and beautiful book,"I was very moved by this book--to tears, which is unheard of for me. How Greg Bottoms gets into his brother's head creates amazing feeling. I couldn't explain how he does it. I'm no critic, alas, just an avid reader, particularly of books having to do with abnormal psychology, and also Southern literature. One of the reviewers below didn't like this tact (the same person mentions a trial when in fact there is no trial, only an admission of guilt to arson and attempted murder and then a sentence to the psych ward of a maximum security prison). To me this kind of imaginative writing and conjecture as to the state of the subject's mind during his crimes made what could have just been an interesting memoir into a special one, even a great one. I felt this rose above the level of personal tragedy and said something important about illness, family, and even contemporary society. Fine work, indeed."
5,MONSTROUSLY POIGNANT,"Greg Bottoms has written a first rate, in-depth account of lifewith a schizophrenic older brother...Greg Bottoms makes animpassioned entreaty for the world at large to recognize the dire needfor caring the dangerous mentally ill. He becomes an expert based onhis experiences with his sick brother. Greg Bottoms has written afirst rate book that no reader will ever be able to forget."
4,very well written,"My wife got this book for school and I happened to pick it up and read it before she did. While the story itself is rather depressing the insight given by Greg's story is enlighting. We have so far to go yet in truely helping people with mental and emotional needs, yet we continue to throw drugs at people and hope they will just go away. Awesome book!"
5,A small masterpiece,"Angelhead is a gripping, searing memoir of madness and how it rips apart a family. It's also a powerful testament to the redemptive power of creativity, writing, and reading. Greg Bottoms and his family were terrorized by his schizophrenic brother for years. They thought he was a drug addict, a bad seed who couldn't get his act together, and they suffered crippling guilt when they discovered he was actually mentally ill. Bottoms has an economically powerful style--every word, every phrase has huge emotional impact. This is NOT just a book for those interested in mental illness, or family memoir--this is a book for anyone who cares about wonderful writing and the power of the creative process."
4,Disturbing and dramatic,I liked this book. The author and his family went through a lot. I can see the link between criminal statistics and the disease of the mind. It spills out within this family.
5,the best book I've ever read!,This is absolutely the most wonderful book I have ever read! Greg Bottoms is a truly talented writer and I think everyone should read this book. It is truly amazing.
5,"THANK THE STARS, IT'S HERE!","I just happened to stumble over the first book in the Deverry series. I have to say, it is one of the most satisfying fantasy epics I've ever read. After completing the series two years ago, my only complaint was that it was over. I've hoped and prayed for another visit to Deverry since. I was absolutely thrilled with Kerr's ""The Red Wyvern"". As she's done so many times before,I was draw to the story of ""present time charactors"", only to be thrust into the past to be reacquainted with charactors I was teased with in previous books. Katherine Kerr has done what every epic writer needs to do...She left me chopping at the bit for the next book."
3,Deverry Series,"An OK book, though if not a bit too interconnected with the prior books in the series. Having read all the books in the Deverry series, it was not hard to follow. However, if anyone should want to read this book, it would probably be better if they start with either the 'xxxxspell' books or the 'Time of xxxx' books. Nevertheless, it is good in that it is not complete fantasy - i.e. that it is not completely impossible to believe. If you read all the books you end up following the history of Deverry almost as if it had actually occurred. Also, it tells of the lives of people (both the elves, men, dwarves and Horsekin) entwined. A good book overall."
4,Not the first one you should read in these series...,"Wow, this book sure was hard to follow, I had to refer back to my copies of the first four books to recall who all those people were and what their part in the story was. It goes right back to the 100-year civil war.Actually, it might just be a good read for someone who hasn't read any of the previous books, so scratch the subject above<g>.A new reader will just think it's a good fantasy novel, and then learn that many of the characters are part of a MUCH larger tapestry. How I envy readers who are new to the world of Deverry!"
5,A slightly different book,"The author has a fresh idea that is both interesting and captivating. The basic theme was thought up with what one can call, 'An imaginative air'. The author invites the reader into a world where anything can happen. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves to read fantasy."
4,Very consious,this is a great reggae album especially for those who listen to roots and culture. luciano's music makes care about life around you and far.
2,okay..,"add said that it melts easier than Lincoln flux core wire. this is true however it melts before it gets to the pool!!! james in the gun all the time, this is basically junk, do not buy. i own nothing but Millers however i only run Lincoln wire, DO THE SAME!"
5,Incredible Movie,"I don't have much to say, that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. I first saw this program on public television and it left me feeling very moved and inspired. I wanted to see it again and share it with all my friends!!! I was absolutely repulsed by the greed of the Nazi party. I guess I never realized the extent of the pillaging! It only made me hate them more and hope that the historical places on this earth never have to suffer war again!"
5,A very interesting movie,I found this movie to be so interesting. I learned so many more things about Hitler and the way he began his terrifiyng reign. I never knew he was quite that into art and tried to destroy entire cultures by erasing their art and architecture. I saw one of my friends father in law giving commentary in this movie as an art historian and that was the most meaningful part for me. His name was Kenneth Lindsey.
3,What about Dresden?,"I have read too much literature, especially Jewish, to buy completely into this account ... but I find the subject matter of the film interesing as part of the fascist story. It fails to account for contemporary German artists (and socialists) expelled from Germany, and it does not explain the bombing of DRESDEN by the USA. How can you have such a major work on European Art and the protection of its destruction and speak NOTHING about Germany's greatest ART CENTER Desden??? I would have bought most of what this documentry sold me but for its omission of Dresden. Given the cultural wealth Dresden sacrificed for the opposition to win the war it is SHAMEFUL this film failed to mention it. Was it because Americans DECIMATED German Art History for no reason at all? Was it because Dresden art had a story to tell? ... affirmed some of the German work of the time artworthy or anti-fascist? ... implicated somebody? .... concealed evidence?"
3,jr,"Very good exploration of Nazi art theft, but the title misguides the reader. The book barely touches the rape Soviets executed over the art works of Eurpe, whuch Russia todays continues to ignore. Shame the exploration wa not complete and the book and movie, while very well documented, is just one more in the plethora of books that deal ad nauseam with an already well documented attrocity."
5,Saving Masterpieces from Nazis for future generations,I will never see any nmasterpiece without thanking the common citizens for saving it from the Nazis for future generations to see. What a story!! I first rented the dvd was so taken with the story that I logged on Amazon to buy it and see repeatedly and gave this one as a gift to an art major.
5,Life Savers,I'm so glad to find this product online. I haven't been able to find it in stores for years. It's my favorite flavor. The product is in good shape when I receive it: not broken or mangled.
5,the perfect lifesaver,"A candy and a mint, it freshens your breath, suppresses coughs, and soothes a sore throat or queasy stomach, AND the ""silent"" packaging lets you sneak one during a show or movie without disturbing anyone - it's perfect, and the Amazon price can't be beat."
5,Crystomint Lifesavers,"I love Crystomint lifesavers but was not able to buy them at any of the retail outlets because they don't carry them any more. I was thrilled to be able to order them from Amazon. They were lower in cost, fresher and the service was exceptionally good."
4,Mi-MH Rechargeable Battery Pack,"Battery was excellent! Note the word ""WAS"".After chasing down many leads and electronic supply depots I have been unable to personally purchase a duplicate NI-MH battery to replace the original lost in Alaska!"
1,wear out in under a week,"the camera is a great product, but Kodak keeps getting me on the come back. I have to buy these stupid batteries every few eeks it seems. I wish someone would have warned me before buying this camera."
1,Wrong Item Sent,The item described is not what I received and I didn't realize it and it has caused me hours of frustration and more money. Judy Hanson
1,no juice,"I love my Kodak camera, hate my kodak battery. Unfortunately, you have to use this particular battery if you have an easy dock. I wish I didn't have an easy dock now. I think any other rechargable battery would be better than this one."
2,"Don't buy new, replace the cells!","Our old DX6440's battery pack wouldn't take a charge, so I took the pack apart, replaced the cells with Duracell 2650mah cells by hot-glueing them onto the center plastic piece. Bingo, a much better battery pack.Then, just to see, I did a quick charge of the old cells just to get some voltage in them and stuck them in my Lacrosse charger for a refresh. The last cycle they showed ~1860-1870mah, much better.The only thing to really watch is to make sure you glue the pack back together with the batteries positioned properly so the plastic tab hits the switch inside the battery compartment to identify it's a rechargeable pack, then the docks will recharge them."
1,Do not buy it!,Got the battery with the docking station. I only got three pictures before it went low. I have had no luck with it keeping a charge past one picture since.
1,Multiple Types of KAA2HR,"I am disappointed in kodak for making multiple versions of the KAA2HR. They really need to create new part numbers or a ""dash number"" for various mAh ratings. Each battery is a different size and won't fit into all chargers. I first purchased the Radio Shack copies and found they wouldn't fit in my charger. Now I find Kodak makes batteries that don't fit in the Kodak charger either.All I can say is Kodak is a mess with their batteries, chargers and part numbers. The Kodak brandname now has negative value to me. Stay away and buy good generic AAs."
1,Do not like the rechargeable battery,"I got a rechargeable with camera and it becomes low after a few picture's. I went out and bought batteries at Radio Shack (lithium) which are working great!! Now I see other's are having the same problem I was, so... I'll stick to the lithium."
2,No enough information about product,"Amazon fails to give the part number of this recharageable battery. Kodak makes a couple of different rechargeable batteries. Upon purchasing this battery pack I discovered that the one I received would not charge on the dock. Also, the battery pack was shipped with the packaging damaged and the battery was loose in the box. I would definitely recommed anybody needing and purchasing this particular battery pack order it directly through Kodak."
1,Save your money! Will not keep a charge!,"I just got the Kodak EasyShare Dock 6000, which came with this battery pack. I also followed Kodak's charging instructions (charge fully, discharge, charge fully, discharge, etc.) and still this battery would not hold a charge past 4 or 5 photos. It's junk! I am looking to see if another company makes a battery pack that can be used with this Dock. Till then, I will stick with CR-V3 lithium batteries."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I purchased THREE battery packs and not one of them lasts as long as they should. I get a maximum of about 45 minutes between the three of them. I always get stuck at functions with way fewer pictures than I would like. I'm not sure what to recommend in place of the battery pack but I'm looking for something rechargeable. . .that works! This product really does not work and was a complete waste of my money. I hate to give bad ratings but this one is not even worth the one star I gave it.
1,Reluctant purchase,I am reluctantly ordering this replacement battery. The first one gave poor service. Very frustrating to take your camera somewhere and get only a couple of shots before the battery goes dead. The non-rechargeable ones that came with it did better than that. When I talked to Kodak they recommended downloading a different software presumably so my computer could teach the battery how to hold a charge longer. It didn't work. Gonna try again. Wish it was at Kodak's expense. If this one doesn't work I'm gonna look for a good price on a case of disposable AA batteries. Or maybe I'll try another camera. Can't afford this.
1,Save your money,"This battery does not hold a charge, in spite of following Kodak's instructions for charging it. Very unsatisfactory."
4,Happy with straight hair.,Very happy with this product. Returned a similar product before ordering this one. Good move on my part.
3,Good but too narrow.,"I have very thick, curly hair and the patience of a 5 year old. I thought that a .07 inch width would not be drastically different than a 1 inch frame, but unfortunately it made a big difference in time spent on straightening.It seems like this product would be good for finer hair, but if you have thick, curly hair and not a lot of time, I would go for the 1 inch."
1,Worked great...and then DIED,"I usually don't write reviews, but felt the need to share my experience with perspective buyers.This hair straightener works great (heats up fast, easy to use, etc), but died within one year. As a matter of fact, I was trying to see if I could get a replacement, since it was under the warranty period, but the customer service rep at Farouk informed me that because I bought from an online retailer (Amazon) the warranty is void.Buyer beware."
4,This is a pretty good flat iron but......,"This is a pretty good flat iron, but I wish I had paid attention to the reviewer who said that the casing around the iron is too thick. If you have really short hair the casing will get in the way, and you will have problems curling or straightening your hair. I wish that I had looked around for a .05 inch ceramic flat iron, with lessing casing, because I have shorter hair. If you have longer hair, then this flat iron will work just fine."
2,turbo mini chi,"The turbo mini chi dries my hair out. I was very surprised about this.It also, although it is a mini .07, has so much products casing around the actual iron that the mini part of why I orignally bought is null and void! It is impossible to straighten your hair from the roots like you can with the other small farouk chi flat iron.I would not recommend this product to anyone. It works for now, but I am not satisfied. I should request my money back!!!"
5,worth every dollar!,"I had been using cheap ceramic-plated straighteners, even though my sister, brother in-law, and friends all had been using CHI's for a few years (and I would borrow every chance I got), but I never could bring myself to buy one b/c of the cost...if you are sick of frizzy, unmanageable hair- it's worth it! Just be careful! It gets hot instantly, so imagine the damage it can, and will, do to your hair if you don't protect it!***UPDATE***I am still using this! I got this when it was on sale (on Amazon) for about eighty bucks. It's been 5 years! So yeah, totally worth the price. I use it everyday."
4,Good thing I read French,"I bought this product based on the glowing reviews here. However, no one mentioned that the only bits of English to be found are on the page called Descriptions which specifys the names of the parts of the iron. ALL the rest of the instructions are in French! I've never owned one before though I have had one used on my hair in my favourite salon. I am very disappointed that the box is written in multiple languages but user instructions and most importantly the vital part of safety warnings are only in French. *a few weeks later I must add..it works GREAT even on the lowest setting and does exactly what I wanted it to do. Still have a few misgivings about the language issue but a ""how not to"" lesson from my stylist solved the problem."
3,Ok... but,I used this for a while and was pretty satisfied... Than I bought a ghd and was blown away. It turned out that the chi was frying my ends and taking about twice the time.
2,Apple Pie,"From what my niece told me, the part of the pie that she was able to salvage tasted fine. Due to the poor packing (a block of ice was placed on top!),half of the pie was damaged. She wasn't able to display the pie properly on Thanksgiving day. I would advice the vendoe to take care when packing."
5,"""Salsamuffin"" makes great raod music.","I'm not really too much of a salsa or reggae fan. I bought this album after hearing a story about ""salsamuffin"" and Mr. Garcia on NPR. I thought his story was interesting and the snippets of music that were presented were quite appealing. The whole concept of ""salsamuffin"" as presented by Mr. Garcia was intriguing.I'm hooked. This is a pleasant and energetic hybrid of Caribbean, African, reggae and salsa music that is infectious. The songs all have high energy, a nice emotive quality and a high level of musicianship. The production values are better than I expected, given that Mr. Garcia is based out of Havana and one presumes that he's not using state-of-the art equipment on the recording side.This album has retained a more-or-less permanent place in my car CD player. It's a great road album!Highly recommended!"
4,Very readable introduction to spiritist educational concepts,"This book is a very readable and accessible introduction to spiritist education and spiritist pedagogy. It defines the core elements of spiritist pedagogy, which is the spiritist developmental view on humanity. From there, the concepts are integrated with the mainstream and widely accepted insights from developmental and learning psychology. The issue is covered in ten modules, 234 pages, each module containing several topics, laying out key-concepts, and providing collateral reading and references to as well the basic and the more advanced spiritist literature. Suited for those interested to apply spiritist pedagogy in the field of school-related education, individual coaching, and to those working in the field of guiding others in the study of Spiritism."
4,Extremely insightful!,"This book gives a very concise summary of where Islam came from, and more importantly where Islam is going. We in the West are quick to jump conclusions, based on biased media. However, after reading this book, I found this to be a good introduction to understanding a way of life most of us have no insight into. We westerners are especially guilty of assuming that Islam is monolithic, when in fact there are many versions of Islam being practiced around the world, just like there are many different versions of Christianity. Most terrorists are using Islam as a smokescreen to justify their behavior. If they were really living their faith, they would not be perpetrating the violent acts we hear about in the media. But, of course, the same can be said about Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The only question is, will we learn from our past mistakes, or will we plunge headlong into the abyss of ignorance."
2,"Full of expectations, but...","HiHaving read 100's of reviews on SQL*Plus books I finally decided on this book. I felt that I had to give feedback as this book is not as good as the other reviews make it to be. I was looking for a book that specifically contained info on SQL*Plus syntax and a bit of SQL.I was full of expectations, but ended up being very disappointed. The books does cover SQL and it does cover SQL*Plus, but it never goes into any real depth on either topics. I love real world examples that I can actually refer back to and use on the job. Unfortunately this is not one of those books. If you are not an absolute beginner and can already do a fair bit of SQL/SQL*Plus then this book is not for you."
1,Disappointed,"Disappointed; although quite lengthy in its treatment of the subject matter what use is an index when the pages are not numbered? In addition, the much touted companion CD, where is it?"
4,Just one little thing....,"We love Baby Einstein toys, and we have many of them. We have these & the color blocks. The number blocks are neat! They have 1 through 4 in 3 languages, and the 4th one says the numbers when you squeeze it...It would be nice if it were easier to activate the sound box, though. It only works if you squeeze it just right. Also, the tiger tail is a let down if you have the color blocks -- the frog's leg makes the block vibrate when you pull on it, but the tiger's just stretches. These are great blocks, nonetheless. The stitching has held up well to two teething girls!"
4,Security + Exam Cram,Overall the book was a good read and reference even though the exam is now at a 2007 level. The CD in the exam question book had some whopper wrong questions in it. There is 730+ questions in there and I found at least a dozen that the answer was wrong on. There is good study material here for the most part. It helped me pass the test on June 30th 2008.
3,Helpful but confusing...,"This book was good study material for the Security+ test but there were aspects of it that were confusing. Many of the answers to the practice tests directly contradicted information in the book and some questions were worded very ambiguously. The practice tests included actually made me doubt my ability to pass the exam but I still showed up to take the test anyway. I passed no problem.Bottom line is....this book is decent study material for the test, it includes a pretty good overview of all of the objectives and covers all the important points, but the actually practice questions and tests are sub-par in my opinion.PS: This book is for the earlier edition of Security+, not the 2007 edition. If you use this book to study for the 2007 edition (which I did) also be prepared to answer questions about WPA/WPA2 and anomaly-based IDS systems, which are not covered in the book."
5,Charming children's book reviewing the fun in logic,"The author compares why you wouldn't do things the wrong way or illogical way by showing examples of what would happen if you DID. For example, why weave cloth from a thick substance, because if you did the dress would turn out looking like ""this""! and there is a drawing of the example. Fun for a young child to read, a refreshing break from serious reasons why a childl should do things the right way."
3,A perfect solution,"I stumbled upon this at the Chicago Public Library. After reading it and returning it I didn't think much of it. For some reason, however, it stuck with me.After Amazon delivered it I remembered why it stuck with me: the concept is perfect for putting down just the parts of an idea or project you need to remember and those you need to convey. It is perfect in its simplicity.I use this format extensively and find that it helps both me and the reader stay focused on the key points. I highly recommend both the method and the book. This, Tom Sant's Persuasive Business Proposals and Powerful Proposals by David G. Pugh and Terry R. Bacon may be the only books on proposal anyone needs!"
5,Wish I had this book decades ago,"I bought this book because I saw it mentioned in the book""Da Vinci and the 40 Answers.""I wasn't sure it would apply to me, but if a 1-page proposalwere possible in my business, I wanted to know how to doit. I have spent many years developing huge multi-pageproposals. Any shortcut would be appreciated.This book provides the answer I was looking for. It's notreally a faster way to create a proposal (you still gotta doyour homework). But, it's designed as a faster way to getfaster ACTION by the decision maker.Thus, I have incorporated the methods of this book intomy Operations Manuals.Yaaaaay Patrick Riley!Mike"
3,Good for some cases,"I enjoyed the ideas and writing style of this book. I am always interested in techniques for getting to the point faster. This style of proposal may work well when presented to a decision-maker that doesn't have time for the details. Unfortunately, many people do have time for the details or they will pass the proposal down to those who must make time. In those cases, a one-page proposal will lack details that the reader is expecting and, when competing against others, may cause this proposal to be excluded due to insufficient detail.This book will be very helpful for those who write proposals that put people to sleep. At this point, my proposals still need to be in the 2-3 page range; however, there's a chance I just need to get better at fitting all the necessary detail onto a single page."
4,Not for the average deal,"I certainly believe in being brief. I've written long proposals that end up confusing people and me losing the deal. So, I recommend this book to those who would be well served by this type of proposal.Having said that, I don't believe it will help the person who does average deals on the Internet. On the net, you have something to sell. A service perhaps. Someone wants to know what you'll charge to do a certain task, project or job.All you need to do in this case is figure out what the project should fetch and write your prospect, telling him what your job involves and what value you'll bring to the table and how much you'll charge. At least, that's how I see it.So, to me, this book offered nothing I could use. But there are lots of great reviews here and that tells me that many people find it useful. I'm only offering my impression for what it's worth.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
3,"The 1-page concept is good, but this book is not so good...","...unless you have very little business writing experience. The 1-page concept is valid, but this book and its examples are unimpressive (and sometimes dull, naive and self congratulating). Still, it might be worth a quick read for some of you, which is why I'll give it 3 stars. Note: I probably should have given it 2 stars since some of these other reviews are so over the top positive that to me they are not credible (I almost think they were written by shills)."
5,Outstanding,"Great notebook, it's plain and simple, yet stylish... i work with graphic design programs and haven't had any truble at all, runs any program smoothly and optimized, graphics look good and the system is fantastic! Turion 64 rules!"
4,"So far, so good","I needed something to get rid of the musty smell from a very humid autumn here. Ordered after Christmas, but took about 10-days to get here (coming from west coast to the east, reason for delay?). Anyway, it works well and has pretty much eliminated the mustiness from the furniture in the living room. Have had it for a few weeks now. The only thing is during the warranty period, should it stop working, I have to box it up and pay for shipping, insurance, etc., AND send $20 for shipping back to me. I think that is a little excessive. If it stops working, I'll probably just put the money toward something else. But, so far, so good!"
4,Awesome. Lasts for a little over a year.,Made the air smell great. Cleaned out the dust I'm allergic to. Broke after about a year and a few months.
5,Perfect for any single room,"I bought the 3Q Electrostatic Ionic Air Purifier after seeing it work at a friend's place. It does not disappoint. It's perfect for my basement area (16' x 20') as it clears the air and neutralizes any odors. If you are an uptight person, this might not be right for you, but if you are a casual, easy-going person looking for a cheap and effective solution to a smokey or odorous room, this is perfect."
2,not collecting dust etc,"The Ionizer works,the UV lamp works properly- We can smell distinctive germicidal odor!after 3 weeks(as instruction says) I've checked electrostatic plate and wiped it with white napkin &the outcome is nothing-clean( I expected not much but some dust),checked once again after10 days NOTHING!simply clean!But the dust is visibly around the room.No air purification! Returned this purifier back to the seller,the money returned partially-I must payed off all shipping cost- $26.00 short.this purifier does not work for me,frustrated."
3,Ionic air purifier,not what I expected does not remove as much dust as I had anticipated. It does remove odors very well. I have not had it long enough to evaluate the cost. I causes my smoke alarm to sound if I have the fan on.
3,Not bad not great,"I haven't really noticed a huge difference, but the air does feel more peaceful with the ionizer around. Its always good to have negative ions flowing around. It also seems to help purify the air of allergens pretty well. My only problem with it now after owning it for a year or two is that it is loud and rattles constantly. I clean the rod nearly every 2-3 days and it still rattles. Sometimes propping it up will make it stop rattling and making loud noises. Its for the bedroom, so when it suddenly gets loud at 3am it is quite frustrating. Then the room gets stuffy when I shut it off so I can sleep. When its not being rattly and loud though it works pretty well to give off fresh air."
1,Didn't work,This product did not work for me at all. But the merchant did refund which is all you can ask.
4,Lucky 13 - A Gift From Down Under,I found out about Fiona through a article in a Blues Publication. I have since purchased two of her CD's. This particular CD is a great mix of different Blues styles.Any true Blues fan is going to love this CD.
4,"If it's your kind of music, you'll love it.","This album is perhaps a more concentrated dose of the Oingo Boingo sound than any other I can think of - it's, for lack of a better word, weirder than most of their albums... which is not to say that Oingo Boingo usually sound ""normal"", but just to say that people who don't like Oingo Boingo REALLY don't like this album. People who are into that catchy, frenetic kind of edgy 80s pop (myself included), on the other hand, will absolutely adore this album. It's an incredible piece of work, with no particularly weak tracks and several standouts. I only refrain from giving it 5 stars because that perfect rating is deserved ever so slightly more by other albums in the Boingo canon such as the eponymous Boingo or Dead Man's Party."
4,Solo Album???,This is basically the same as an Oingo Boingo album. The only reason I can think of for making it a solo instead is for people like us to ask why it is a solo. Maybe they just wanted to see if it would sell better. After all Oingo Boingo was a pretty stupid name. I don't think it did and that is a shame because this is the best they have done. In conclusion this is a solid Oingo Boingo album that is self titled.
1,Person,This music is truly horrible. Thank Christ that Elfman went on to create such wonderful music as the soundtrack to Edward Scissorhands.
5,A lost Treasure of Great Music,"This would have to be one of the best albulms ever prouduced. With the pounding dance beat of ""Grattitude"" to the sad, depressing sounds of ""Go away"" to the ska influenced taste of ""It only Makes me Laugh"" this albulm will cater for all tastes. Why danny elfman and his band oingo boingo never hit off is beyond me and being a teenager and living in australia proves that Oingo Boingo will continue to endure to men and women of all ages for generations to come. Good Work!!"
5,Highly recommend this album.,"This is a great album if you're either an Oingo Boingo OR Danny Elfman fan. These days, Danny is usually busy writing musical scores for movies. It would be nice if he took a break from that and created another solo album or an album with his former band. I'm sure it would be great, and it would be nice to experiance how his sound has matured over the years. -MicahWave"
5,"fabulous item, brilliant delivery. Recommended to all.",fantastic product - just as described. Very reasonable price and delivered even faster than anticipated. Very pleased - thank you!
4,Nice power strip,"This a great power strip for my home office. One thing you'll find with these power strips is you always want more outlets with battery backup, but the four this strip has is enough for the essentials. This strip also includes USB connectivity and software. The software is not really that extensive and the graphics are a little lacking and there are some bugs causing interface to freeze on occasion but it does the basics, If you are running Windows 7 it has most of the power configurations built in so no need to worry. Overall it works every time if the power goes out my computer does not, great for brownouts."
2,"When it works, it's great","We've been running this UPS connected to one computer. It functioned fine for about a month. Then, we had a power outage and the UPS wouldn't turn back on when I had the computer plugged into the battery backed up slots. I did the self test from the directions, and it was telling me the outlet was overloaded for the battery. I removed everything from the unit and it still gave me the same fault. I had to plug into the regular, non-battery backed up outlets instead. I sent an email to Tripp lite's technical support about the issue. I received an email about 6 weeks later saying ""Sorry we missed your email. Let us know if you're still having the problem."" I later tried switching back to the battery backed up outlet and it was functioning again. I don't hold out much hope on this lasting in the long run. Overall, not impressed."
3,"Works well, smells bad","This was purchased for my mother who is somewhat sensitive to smells and although it did work well (she had a power outage and a couple brownouts while it was connected and it protected her iMac), we ended up returning it as it had a fairly strong smell that didn't go away. It might be fine in an industrial setting or for someone with a limited sense of smell but if you have a sensitive nose you might consider another UPS"
4,Compact and affordable,The unit seems to be working well for my desktop computer and router. The device is seen by my computer but the software that will shut down during a power failure sometimes hangs and does not provide much information about the UPS power draw and run time.
3,More sci-fi pulp,"After enjoying the first in this new Shadowrun series, Poison Agenda was just as fun and makes for a good read. There's no fat here, so it's pretty fast moving. Something all low-class pulp books really should be.Kellan Colt, now a slightly more experienced Shadowrunner, comes across some priceless information about ancient weapons buried deep in the wilderness. None of her pals really want to touch it, believing it tainted or false. But she still assembles her own team and decides to go for it, no matter how much trouble it might end up.Undemanding, unpretentious fun for sci-fi and Shadowrun fans. This new series doesn't seem like it will run out of steam any time soon."
3,Texsport Radford Screen Arbor,"Not easy to put together. Took several adults holding it up to get it together but once it was up, it was great. Bought it for camping and a place in which to contain the toddler grandchildren. Put a tarp under it and it worked great. Even when the weather turned bad, the young ones were dry and safe."
5,Swing Brother Swing,"I've been a fan of swing and Big Band for many years and I bought this CD on the recommendations only. I did not regret it.It's become my favorite.It has some fast ""Rhythm"" and some slow blues like ""Love ain't nothing but the Blues"". Great CD good quality recording even if you play it loud, it still sounds great."
5,Notes from another Shinob,I have thoroughly enjoyed this book that brings back fond memories of my own Ojibwe upbringing. Two Rivers writes with a style that is raw and true to his Anishinaabe people. Gchi Migwetch Eddie!
5,Surviving,"Surviving.... that's what this book is about. That's what bein Indian is about! Mr. Two-Rivers has pinned the tail on the donkey with this book. He offers a true, honest and reflective insight into real Indian life. Using his own life stories of survival, he weaves a story of Indian experience like a master. The reader will laugh, cry and steam, and come away with a new perspective and understanding of what it means to grow up Indian in America. Miigwetch (Thank you) to E. Donald Two-Rivers for surviving. And for telling us about his 'Survivors Medicine'...."
1,"Details, details, details","I am so used to Andre Norton using just the right amount of details to stimulate my imagination and then leaving it up to me to fill in, that I found this book very draggy. It wants to tell you everything and leaves nothing to the imagination. I have never read anything by Susan Schwartz but if this is her effect on Andre Norton's work I don't think I will. Sorry, I like Andre Norton's style. And, while she collaborates well with some people, I don't feel that this is one of those times."
2,"Great potential ,disappointing delivery.","I think the subject matter is fascinating . However one cannot help but be somewhat disappointed by the amount of time spent describing ....thirst in the desert. I agree that tragedy and suffering are an integral part of this story......but only part. Having suffered through this morbid tale I was forced to finish the story because I purchased the book.The scenario promised an exciting tale by a master storyteller, unfortunately the delivery was disappointing."
5,incredible CD,"It's new, awesome and totally delightful.She has incredible lyrics and sure can strum that cello!"
2,Parts not available,"From my experience this is only an average blender and not worth the price when compared to other brands. The good news is that this blender is discontinued, the bad news is it's hard to find a replacement blender jar. I will not buy any kind of Viking product based on not being able to readily get replacement parts for a blender that is only 4-years old at an affordable price! I called the Viking 800 number and was apparently routed to a business outside of the Viking Company. They only had a complete jar/blades/etc unit in white for $69 + shipping. I only needed the blender jar so I would have to pay 50% of my purchase price this replacement part, which is not worth it to me. I now own a black Viking Blender base that makes a nice door stop."
4,cute book,This book would make a great christmas gift. My son enjoyed this story at the library. It also has a place for you to add pictures of your our christmas memories.
3,"For the price, worth it","As many have commented before on other movies in this series, the information and footage isn't new. I have almost the entire series of tank movies. These DVD's are mostly (I stress mostly!) accurate. The footage isn't the greatest and the narrator might put you to sleep - sometimes he sounds like he is falling asleep himself, and often they reuse the same footage more than once in the movie.But, if you love WW2 German tanks and planes, it's worth checking out the whole series. If you're a hardcore tank fan like I am, you might be a little disappointed.But, the price is reasonable, and you might still learn something new."
3,could be much better edited and organised,"whilst there is certainly wisdom in the pages, the book could be much better edited and organised, e.g., some sections go 8 - 9 pages without any sub-headings, which could surely have made reading easier, a glossary will certainly help too, e.g. some words need to be reminded of their meaning: complementarity, risk-neurality etc etc., some footnotes are not neccessary, sometimes the footnotes are just some counter-examples or elaboration and should be included in the main body, and having footnotes at chapter end instead of bottom of page is always silly,at places this book is hard to digest, i wonder if those at the Economist are already academics conversant with the subject, if real managers are to choose, i doubt if they would pick this as book of the year"
5,The Quintessential Strategy Book,"Great book illustrating the interplay between strategy, the firm and the environment. Provides great applications of his framework on real life companies that include HBC, BP and Nokia."
3,Rites of Passage,"I am only reading this book because it tells my brother's story while there in Viet Nam (he is in the book), and he wanted me to read it. I struggle with war stories of any kind, but need to know what he experienced. He has suffered with very bad health these past ten years, not to mention the PTSD once he returned home."
3,A young soldier gave his all for his country.,"A tragic story of a soldier who entered the Army and Vietnam solely to serve his country and then was tragically wounded by friendly fire. Peterson was a native of Wisconsin who entered Vietnam in 1966. As was already known, Vietnam was a dirty little war with many young people going to Canada for the duration. Peterson did not do that. He fought and paid the penalty with a cut spinal cord from friendly fire. This is a story all too typical of the Vietnam veteran's experience.This is an OK, although depressing read. There are no happy outcomes, even though I think the author made something of himself after his injury.He was brave and served his country. His country may not have served him."
2,Headache city!,"To be fair, I have a tendency to have migraines and this herb seemed to aggravate my headaches. So if you struggle with headaches, don't buy this. My friend used it with no side effects and said it gave her energy but wasn't worth the $$$."
1,Weight Loss idea,I ordered this because Dr Oz said it was a good product. The bottle is still sitting in my bathroom cabinet un opened. Not sure of the origin of the product.
4,Basic First Aid for Horses,I thought that this book was very helpful and I always keep it around the barn so I'll almost always know what to do if something happens to my pony. I can't give it five stars because there is no perfect first aid book(for horses).
3,chris,"I think this book is written for academics and not for the general reader, who may want to gain a general understanding of how God may have revealed himself in other cultures. I found what I read quite informative, but have to confess I gave up, because the amount of detail was overwhelming. Having said that I'm sure it will be of benefit to some people. There was no investigation of India or Asia other than China and Korea. Also no investigation of indigenous cultures in Australia or New Zealand or the Pacific."
4,Galina shines!,"Vishnevskaya shines in acting and singing. Although the soundtrack is of quite average quality, the intensity and the psychological aspect of the opera are making this version a must have. It is also an interesting insight into Russia of this time and the rough life of peasants before the revolution -not that it was indeed much better after...-."
5,Great opera and great film!!!,"I'm not going to write so much. The reason is that there's nothing to say about this DVD; everything is wonderful: great actors, great music, great argument... Just perfect!!! Five stars are not enought to rate it. Just buy it, listen/watch it and enjoy it. Drama in extremis! What a wonderful opus! Shostakovich is god!!!"
4,no technical obstacles to writing,"Whatever your political leanings, O'Brien offers a good education about reading and writing political blogs. Many examples of existing blogs are given. With an emphasis on American blogs. She gives a diversity of blogging viewpoints.For readers inclined to contribute to existing blogs, or starting their own, the take home message is that it is very simple. By now, the technical details have been mostly finessed away. You don't need much in the way of a computing background at all. There are only two hard things. Writing interesting and original prose. The book does not, and cannot really help you with this. The other obstacle is getting read by others. Here, the book has some tips. But mostly you should experiment with different ways of attracting notice."
2,not even enough information to be dangerous,"This is a basic beginnger's guide, and has more tangential information than relevant content. In fact, many chapters read like extended glossaries.I have no idea why there is a full religious chapter about faith, family, and friends. Christian parables can make good reading but do not fit here."
2,Please Do Not Waste Time With This Horrible Book,"This book was simply horrible. It was not one bit practical. All it does is teach its readers how foreclosures work. Furthermore, it does a horrible job explaining how they work. Berges, your ripped me off. I want my money back you crook."
5,A Beautiful Slice Of Americana,"Wow! This movie is everything a film should, and could be. The acting was superb- from Ron Perlman, and Ben Allison to the character actors with no more than a line, or two to deliver, but it is the performance of Jonathan Furr that is astonishing ( and he was only eight, or nine at the time ). The award winning screen adaptation was also wonderful, as was the direction, and cinemotography.The story of a young boy trying to join the army, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, to be with his older brother is rich with pathos, humor, and humanity. It is, quite simply, delicious!"
5,cada soldado em seu campo de batalha,"O DVD é especial, mostra como foram rodadas as cenas, os locais , as roupas , apresenta todas as pesssoas envolvidas no processo de realizao de um filme.É impressionante o número de pesssoas envolvidas, mais impressionantes é a colaborao das pessoas. Muitas coisas usadas no filme foram emprestadas e no alugadas ou adaptadas.A busca pela ambientao mais próxima possível das coisas e costumes da época. Como também é impressionante o reconhecimento que o diretor faz das pessoas em frente as cmeras como as que trabalharam atrás. Quanto à história é uma emoo do primeiro minutos até o último.So 40 minutos com um nó na garganta. Vale cada segundo.Adaptao perfeita do conto."
1,C'mon Susan. Don't try to make everyone as cynical as you!,Susan Estrich has taken her leftist feminist podium once again to try to villify everyone and make us think that people are generally evil. This book sounds like every other liberal college professor that has a hard time getting their ideas to stick in the real-world. I found a couple of ideas that she put forth that made you think for a second or two but then she would lam-blast you with unsustained reasons behind her propaghanda. Look elsewhere for GOOD learning material. Definitely not a well-balanced or well thought out argument.
4,Very Good Intro to GoldMine,"This book is a very good intro to GoldMine. At first, I was wondering ""what is this program for?"" and this book answered that early on -- it didn't assume that ""you should already know"", it just went ahead and told you in an easy to understand, practical way. It also provides an easy approach to familiarizing one with the program and shows you step-by-step how to use its various features. The only thing I found annoying were a few instances where it talks about things that it has not told you to open in the program (and it doesn't have screen shots of those either), but even in those situations, it was not hard to get back on track."
2,Covers the basics but...,"I find GoldMine VERY counter-intuitive and difficult to use. I have used numerous other systems and have 20+ years in the computer industry.This book covers the how to do many of the details of managing your data in goldmine.Where if falls (very) short is that is doesn't really give you a road-map to use goldmine, no real best practices and how to at a high level.There IS great info in this book, but by the time I broke down and bought it I had figured out 95% of what is covered. What I was hoping for was a theory of operation, something to make goldmine easier to manage.All in all the book is better than the program!"
2,Details but no overall strategies for managing GM,"Goldmine is very powerful and completely counter-intuitive. This book sheds light on the details of many of the areas of configureation and has lots of helpful information. It does fall short on best practice and usefull methods of using goldmine in a practical fashion.I have found using goldmine to be a terrible and painful experience, simple things become impossibly complex (like data import) this book DOES address some of these topics."
3,"When they say dummies, they mean dummies",I was thinking this was going to be better than the manual or the help files. I thought wrong. I was hoping to get some insight to the technical side of GM. This is not that. Typically good dummies book - my low-ish rating is more my frustration in finding a technical GM reference.
3,"A good book, but not what I expected","This is a well written and thoroughly investigated book, but it was not a great help and comfort to me, after I buried my stillborn child, the main reason being that it dealt in a large capacity with the aftermath of an abortion. In that subject, it is an excellent book, but in the area of grieving a stillborn child, there was not much said. The emotions are far different, and would be better dealt with in separate venues."
1,I'll hold you in Heaven,"did not help me deal with anything! I think it avoided answering any of the questions by refering to the Bible. If I was anymore upset about this I would have actually went to be with my child. It focused on ""you will meet your child/ren one day"". I wanted to do that."
3,"From my point of view, could of been better","When I first got this book I couldn't put it down! I admired the Christian view the most. However, I didn't feel that the author realized the situation and didn't have much of a connect of what I am going through. Also I was very disappointed that the author kept going back to abortation rather than miscarriage...the title was misleading."
1,don't bother with this book,"I failed to find any comfort in this writer's work, even though I'm a Christian and believe pretty much everything he believes. He makes many unwarranted assumptions and some of the ""science"" was kind of ludicrous. I left the book feeling I'd wasted my time and money. He clearly wanted to write a book only about aborted babies, based on the time he spends dealing with abortion, and seemed to branch out to include stillbirth and neonatal death in order to have enough of a book to publish. Take a pass on this one. There are far superior Christian bereavement resources out there."
4,Helped me cope with what happened to the baby,"After two years of infertility and two consecutive pregnancy losses at 8 weeks and 13 weeks, I have read many excellent books that helped me understand and deal with the emotional aspects of my miscarriages. However, none of them dealt as directly as I would have liked with what happens to the baby. I instinctively felt that the baby would be in heaven, but I was clueless as to what kind of form the baby would take, if I would know my baby when I got to heaven, etc.This book addressed these questions very directly and with excellent scriptural back-up. I now have every confidence that I will spend eternity with both of my children, and that we will know and love each other when we are reunited.This book is NOT a guide for dealing with the grief aspects of pregnancy loss, but it will answer many questions about the reality of your child as a living being. The answers to these questions were a big help to me in my quest for healing."
5,Very helpful book,"This book was given to me when I lost a child. The book gave me a lot of encouragement and answered alot of nagging questions with promises/truths from God's word. After reading it, I found comfort in the knowledge that my child was in heaven."
3,Only plays new discs,"I've had this machine for a little over six months. The sound is excellent, looks great. Great feature set for the money.Lately, however, most dvds stop playing part way into the movie (CDs work fine). Only brand new discs play. I cleaned the player using a special dvd cleaner disc and this did not help.Now I'm back to a $99 combination dvd/vhs player I bought last year which seems to play any dvd no matter how scratched or beat up."
3,one,"One is a Drummer is a fine counting book that could have been even more useful had it numerals and Chinese characters for the numbers. Although lacking in this aspect as a counting book, Thong does not limit herself to just a Chinese experience, she encompasses the Chinese - American childhood. She includes dragon boats and fish balls images that are characteristically Chinese, but rather than limit herself to things that are just Chinese, she is open to the other things about childhood such as dancing in the sprinklers and puppies. Grace Lin's unassuming illustrations are deceivingly simple in that bold definite lines block in complex patterns. This is a well-crafted book. The author and illustrator collaborated well to produce a nice counting book."
3,Not as good as I expected,"This book is funny, and worth it for the price, but as a loyal reader of DailyConfession for 4 years, there have been better confessions on the site than the ones listed here. I hate to crack on the beloved Webbie, but some of the decisions for included confessions could have been better."
1,"Horrible, read to laugh at Bob only!","This is a horrible effort from Bob ""the Bachelor"" Guiney. Trite, sophmoric, and full of pat sentiments, this book is a disaster. It all starts with the photo on the cover, and just goes downhill from there. I felt no sympathy at all for this bozo, only for myself for soldiering through this awful book."
1,Blob's Sob Story- He should write a Diet Book instead,"Okay, let's put the pig snout aside, and pretend he is attractive. If you want to hear a grown man cry about being dumped by his wife, how he slept around, gained a whale's weight and learned to write horrible teenage girly problem music, and THEN had enough of an ego boost to go on the Bachelor to shamelessly promote himself, then this is the crappy book for you! As for me, I will never get the time back that I wasted reading this garbage, and I am out 12 bucks. Let's hope his music career ends fast and we can spare ourselves from having to see this Average Schmo much longer. Shame on whoever convinced Bob that he is talented or has a story worth telling."
4,nice in-depth personification,"Helped me learn more about a friend that I didn't know otherwise. Nice to see his grass roots work ethic and determination amount to some well deserved respect. Best wishes, Bobby."
4,An inspiration to all,I just finished reading what a difference a year makes and I can't believe the way it moved me. Having recently gone through a similar setback/tragedy with the death of a loved one I could relate to the feelings of not being able to move forward or see my life being any different than it was in the moment in time that I was currently experiencing consumed with sadness. Reading about his journey through self-awareness and character defining moments was and should be an inspiration for all. It gives you hope that with every passing day is an opportunity to turn things around and life can change for the better! Thanks Bob for having such an impact on me and how I will view things from this point forward!
1,0 stars for this loser and his book,"This book was a joke. Bob is a joke. Why this guy deserves a book deal is beyond me. He doesn't have anything new to say than any other person would who went through the same situation. So his ex-wife grew a brain and dumped this self-centered loser. The guy never should've been on the Bachelor either. He is light years from ever committing to a woman. He knew that and still went on the show. Now nobody respects him after what he did to Estella and the viewers. The guy needs to grow up. Plus, this guy's 15 minutes have been up a long time ago. Somebody should let him know and spare us from seeing his mug and ego anymore. Go back to Michigan and stay there, Bob. You ain't a star. Ain't gonna be one. Don't waste your money or time on this book."
1,"If NO stars was a choice, that would be my rating...","I laugh at the 5 star ratings from Michigan. Obviously friends of his. Misleading. This book sucks. It is all about his relationship with his ex-wife. (If I were HER, I'd be pissed about all the information freely given out.) OBVIOUSLY, this book shows that he is NOT over her. Who cares. I was looking for something inspirational. NOT. Hey, Bob- go have another vodka drink. Is that all you and your family and friends do?? You are not a teenager anymore... you and your sister and friends should stop acting like them.By the way... note to Bob... your Grandmother must have had an ANGIOGRAM, not ANGIOPLASTY. Check out the difference. The fact that THAT was wrong, itself, besides, what seems to me, a lack in the grammar-checking department for commas, really bugged me.CRUMMY BOOK!! I was pro-Bob when he was on the Bachelorette, but that's about it. He was the underdog, and I felt that I should just be pulling for him. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK."
3,Very interesting spy book,"I found David Wise's book to be quite entertaining and well written. It's amazing how someone like Ames could have gotten away with spying for so long. And equally amazing that the CIA was so compartmentalized that they could not see the spying taking place under their noses. Equally frustrating to see is how Ames's bosses refused to really discipline Ames for his drinking. He was often categorized as lazy and yet he continued to worm his way into those dividend jobs where he could continue to spy. I gave the book only three stars, however, since I thought the book was good and entertaining...but I didn't think it was a page turner. But, still a good read."
3,MS Project for Dummies is a good starter,"MS Project for Dummies is a good starter for the basic usage of this program. Good for first time users. If your looking for more advance skills, I would go somewheres else."
2,Too heavy handed,"Gage was an early feminist, and this is her polemic, written in 1893, showing how religion, the law, and male-dominated custom oppressed/s women. She is fierce in her criticisms--and stony cold. Reading it is like being whipped with a stick. Perhaps this is a good thing overall, but I found her approach way too heavy handed."
2,"In a word, disappointing.","Apart from paid reviewers I can't see anyone with any actual knowledge of security rating this book 5 stars. It is not as clear and concise as it should be, and the technical knowledge is freely available at securityfocus.com and other sites. A better job could have been done with security and privacy policies.More effort should have been put forth in providing common sense (implementable) solutions or best practices instead of re-hashing material that other books have already done a better job presenting.I normally enjoy O'reilly books but like the first edition, this book is a disappointment."
3,Good book,"Good read, but primarily as an introductory primer. General info and comprehensive, with good discussion and resources. But to really get into the nuts and bolts of this subject, you will need to find other books. Somewhat esoteric at times and frustrating."
3,Just a big discussion.,"I think this is another one of those big books that tries to cover too many topics. It's really just a general discussion about web security, rather than a handbook of any kind. There is a lot of boring history, storytelling, etc.I do think there were a handful of solid rules-of-thumb and practical wisdom, and I'm glad that I read this book, but it could have been condensed dramatically.I believe most people who are going to actually deploy some kind of web service would probably get all the same info, plus much more practical detail, by reading books on the particular software they plan to use (e.g. Apache, Sendmail, Unix, etc)."
1,waste of money,"one of the earphones comes off all the time and they are not stereo, you only hear the one on the side with the cord."
5,Viva El Chicano: Best of,"If you remember El Chicano back in the day, they were one the best bands out there. I have all their lps and now that they are on cd my collection will be up to date. If you are fan,get this one."
4,Product is Truthfully HOT!,"I received my bottle of Dave's Ultimate Insanity Hot Sauce today, and after reading dozens of reviews about mixed experiences, I was becoming skeptical about if it was really that hot. My bottle seamed new, and sauce wasn't globby. It was nice, and pure. I (poured)a little bit and tried it on a taco. The following things happened,1. My throat caught A flame and began to accelerate in heat.2. My tongue was next as I began to chew.3. I swallowed the bite quickly as a reaction to extinguish the heat (yeah right..)4. Thinking smart I poured a glass of milk, and drank, and drank, and drank....5. Going through a few glasses the pain was nice, and hot. I was happy to know the sauce wasn't a lie.6. 15 minutes pass, and the flame was extinguished I was happy that the sauce was really hot, and so was my mouth a very nice addition to any meal for a real spice, I'm sure it would be great for chili."
3,Middle-of-the-road extract sauce,"I'm a hot sauce junkie and have eaten many bottles of Dave's and other sauces. I rate Dave's Ultimate Insanity an average.It has an unnatural bitter ""cayenne-on-overdrive"" flavor that is usually only found in hotter sauces. I find it's hard to use in cooking as that flavor is as unavoidable as the sauce's heat is. Though the primary ingredient is habanero peppers that pepper's flavor is needlessly absent. That's too bad.There are sauces at equal heat that have more diverse and interesting flavor, and this does include some of Dave's stable, for example his Naga Jolokia sauce. And as I said, there's also hotter sauces out there, although most of these taste similar to Ultimate Insanity.Warning: this is an extract sauce, and it'll do a number on an empty stomach. High-fat dairy is a good cure."
3,Hot but terrible flavor,"I will admit, this is the next step after your usual Habenero sauce. That being said, in any measurable quantity it adds a strong bad taste to your food. It's definitely only something that should be used in tiny quantities to spice up food. I put about 1-2 teaspoons in a regular bowl of soup or chili and you can definitely see the taste and the dark red color from it. It's hot yeah, definitely as you start using it, but after a month or so it's not too bad. Now I'm looking for the next step up."
1,Another chemical experiment,"This is another chemistry product which has little to do with real food. Hot...yes. Good? Well if hot is all there is then this is hot. Food? Not really. Fine food is made directly from food and not the result of ""chemistry."" Flavor? Not much of any kind other than hot sensation. I am not fan of chemistry derived food products such as this or many other which are equally synthetic. This is completely useless to anyone with a desire for other than a hot ""free based"" oil lacking the subtleties of real food with a vast array of odors and taste which only real food has. Hotter sensations can be purchased directly from a chemical supplier without all the bother of pretending a product of chemistry is also a food."
5,excellent,I`ve tried a few different one`s. This is the best so far. I think i`m addicted!! I keep thinking of different food to make so I can add this delicious hot sauce to it!!!
1,Buy it!,"This is a hot sauce you buy just to dare your friends to eat it, then you put it away since it really doesn't have a good flavor just really hot. Maybe you will take it out next time another friend comes by and you want to dare them. Try Marie Sharps it is very hot and great tasting not just a party prank."
4,Plain Heat,"Ok, I just tried this stuff today. Had a couple drops on a cracker...it burned for a while, but subsided. So, I decided to go for a spoonful. It definitely burned...probably for a good 15 minutes or so. It was plenty hot. I felt alright about it...my eyes got a little watery, and I did need a 8 oz glass of milk to wash it down, but it wasn't unbearable by my standards (my two friends, who also tried the spoonful, would differ on that point, though!)The only concern that one may have is that it definitely burns both ways, so keep that in mind. Don't try to use this stuff like Tobasco...just use a couple drops. I would highly recommend trying dipping a toothpick in it and tasting it first so you know your limits."
3,Really hot,"Before trying this sauce I tried the Dave's Gourmet Insanity sauce, and honestly I don't feel any much difference between these two sauces. However, it is a very hot sauce. Be aware."
5,Great Hot Sauce,I have a very diversified collection of hot sauces bought through Amazon. Dave's Ultimate Insanity is one of the better ones. A spicy sauce with a good amount of heat. I highly recommend it! I have a lot of different types to suit the mood I'm in while cooking. The Dave's brand is a great brand!!
4,"Hot, not the Hottest, but still Hot.","When I first got this I tried a drip of it in a bowl of noodles, brought on a nice little sweat. Uped the anty for a few days until I arrived at 10 drips, which brings on a good sweat and a burning mouth, no worries about the burning, goes away in 10-20 minutes.You may be wondering why I say drips and not drops, and that is because the bottle is completely open, so good luck just getting a drop, maybe if your really careful with pouring it, me, I just drip it out. ;)All in all pretty good hot sauce to add some heat to whatever you like."
4,Used the crap out of this,"This pillow was very supportive to my baby belly and my back. My husband was worried I would keep using it after our daughter was born, and I was tempted! Will use again for 2nd pregnancy!"
5,My wife LOVES it!,"My wife researched a lot of different pillows for her pregnancy, and found this one. We ended up getting it on Amazon, and she LOVES it. The pillow case is a bit tricky to get one once you take it off to wash it, but it eventually gets back on with a little work. Great quality product, and she sleeps better with it."
5,Best Purchase EVER!,"I cannot tell you enough good things about this pillow. I got it when I was 20 weeks pregnant, when the backache started to come & the headaches because my body & head were not positioned properly thru the night. After much research & talking to friends about a body pillow I decided to purchase this one and can honestly say I don't regret it at all. The price was a little hard for me to swallow for a pillow I would only use until the labor & delivery but something had to be done since I wasn't sleeping well. The pillow supports your belly & legs & is long enough & fluffy enough that I don't even need anything for my head or back. It's pretty large but does the job of 6 pillows and stays in position all night. After the first night I would have paid double what I did because I felt so much better. Now, 2 months later I can't sleep without it and have even talked about missing it after my babies are born!"
5,My sister and her fiance love it,"At first i was hesitant in purchasing this item, because some of the reviews criticized and complained about the ""corners' being uncomfortable, and other minor issues but i did more research and found this to be the best out of the whole maternity pillows. To my relief i was right, my sister has fallen in love with this thing and claims that its the most comfortable thing ever and it helps get rid of her heartburn. she also says its great due to the fact that she can turn finding a comfortable spot while never having to re-adjust it. If you were in my position, not knowing a damn thing about maternity pillows, trust me, after hours of research i came to pick this one, and it was clearly the best pick, i still get thanked for it up to this day. I highly recommend this to whoever is pregnant, or wants a comfy mega body pillow"
5,A must have for pregnancy,"I was not sleeping, couldnt get comfortable, and was miserable about my 6th month. My mother bought this for me and this thing is pure heaven. If you are pregnant and cant get comfortable in bed, buy this pillow."
4,Comfy but big.,"I bought this because I am a back sleeper and I wanted something to stop me from rolling onto my back. This pillow is very comfy but it is big I have a California King and it takes up half the bed, if you have a Queen your husband will end up on the couch haha. The seam at the top is kind of hard but I just put a light blanket on the top and it has never bothered me. I really love this pillow and it does help me sleep a lot better!"
5,A Godsend for Pregnancy-related Back Pain,"This thing is big, yes, but there's still enough room for me, the pillow, husband, and 60 pound dog in our queen sized bed. Granted, it does make for awkward cuddling since it envelopes you in a cocoon of support and slumber-inducing comfort, but you can always cuddle with your significant other some other time. My back was in serious pain as my ligaments loosened and I'm so glad I bought this. I thought it was pricey, but you can use it as a nursing pillow after the baby comes so it'll be nice to have in our bedroom post-delivery. It does look ridiculous and has been coined ""the pool boy"" in my house, but this thing is a honestly a lifesaver. Just buy it and get a good night's sleep for a change."
5,I would be regret if I didn't buy it.,"I had sleeping problem when I was in 5 months. I couldn't sleep because of the back pain. I purchased this pillow when I was in 6 months. The pillow is very good, when I slept on one side, the other side of the pillow will support my back. I'm so regret that I don't buy it earlier. It would be even better if it had included extra pillow case (not white color)."
2,Not comfy and too big,"This pillow is HUGE. I am married and in our queen there was hardly room for my husband. It kept sliding off the bed which made it impossible to lay in it properly. It irritated my tremendously so I returned it. Too expensive not to be awesome. I was 5 months pregnant when I bought it thinking it would help me from sleeping on my back (because you are not supposed to) and it made my sleep more uncomfortable then sticking one of my regular pillows in between my legs, which I'm back to doing now. Try a boppy if you're pregnant instead?"
4,"Has definitely helped, but not completely eliminated hip pain",I would recommend this product. I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because my hip pain isn't completely gone. I will state that I've slept much better since I've gotten this pillow. My hip pain has minimized quite substantially. I love how you can go from one side to the other.It is quite large. My husband says it takes up WAY more than half of our queen bed. I don't agree. I think it takes up a little more than half (he is just not used to being totally on his half).
2,not perfect for all,"Bought this for my wife who has back pain and sciatica. It made her sciatica worst and did not alleviate her backpain. A lot of people say it works wonderfully, but my wife did not have a good experience with it."
5,It's a life saver!,"This is one of the best purchases I've made to help myself during my pregnancy. I love the back support I get from this pillow. I bought this pillow when my back started to hurt and the pain has disappeared since then! I don't find it comfortable to keep my belly on this pillow and so I don't get the belly support that this pillow is supposed to give but since I feel better without any support in my belly I'm fine with that. I love the shape and thickness of this pillow, it prevents me from turning to my back and provides back support no matter which side I'm lying down. Trust me and buy this pillow and I'm sure you'll love it!"
2,didn't work for me.,"This pillow is so bulky, it leaves very little room for your bed mate. Also the inside seam of the pillow was very uncomfortable. I used the pillow for a week, hoping I would get used to it and now it just sits in a corner of our bedroom, it will likely never be used again."
4,Good Pillow,"I did not find the pillow to be itchy or have an irritating seam as some of the other reviewers. I would agree with previous reviews that turning it upside down is a bit more useful - having the head pillow around my feet and keeping my normal pillow for my head. The body pillow ""head"" area is way too puffy for me and hurst my neck.Generally speaking, I have liked the pillow. I had to turn our AC up another notch as it is a bit cozier to sleep with, and no blanket at all now. Having the body pillow on either side is a bit handier as far as leg repositioning, but not incredibly so.Overall I am glad to have it - I had a Gift Certificate, and think that for what I paid out of pocket I am satisfied, not sure I would feel the same if I paid full price??"
1,Ouch My Neck!,I had a friend who loved this so I thought I would try it.My neck hurt after the first night. This does not keep your neckin the correct alignment. I really wanted it to work.I recommend curling up with a very comfortable blanket-you can tuck it in where you need extra support.
3,Huge pillow!,"Being pregnant and using this pillow is difficult when you have to get up to urinate 10 times in a night. You'll end up fully awake struggling to get out of the bed with this thing! It does offer good support for sitting while watching t.v. or reading, or if you suffer from GERD. Like most of the other reviews, the pillow's head support seam digs into your shoulder unless you plop your regular pillow on top to block the seam. I did like the fact that this pillow does come with a pillow cover so that you can slip it off for laundering."
2,Possibly too big?,My wife tried to use it at the beginning of the 2nd trimester and the beginning of the 3rd trimester with little luck. She said it is just too big. She just uses 2 king size pillows and one standard body pillow with polyster fill. I'm sure this would work for many others. It is well made and seems to be filled very evenly. Washing it would probably be a problem as there is no removable cover. (am I mistaken?) Now I'm stuck with a MASSIVE pillow.. Maybe Craigslist...
1,What's Wrong!!!,"I was ordering this pillow at August 19th. But, I can't receive and tracking this item.. today is Sep. 20th!!What's wrong to ship !!Please let me know how can I receive this item quickly!! And, give me any information about shipment!"
3,A little disappointed,"It was great the first 3 nights but they should have put elastic in the bend of the curve, cause if you open it to a ""U"" shape the material is stretched to its max. But I also feel that the batting breaks down very fast and looses its plush-ness."
3,really good idea...however....,"I normally sleep on my back so I thought that this would be a good way to help me to eliminate the back pain that comes from sleeping on my side during pregnancy. It does help to keep me on my sides throughout the night but now I have different areas of my back that hurt, my shoulders for example. Also I miss cuddling with my husband, we have a queen size bed and (depending on which way I am laying) sometimes half the pillow will fall off the bed and in the mornings I have a hard time getting out of bed with that huge pillow in the way. It's definitely a compromise for me."
4,Very nice,"My back doesnt hurt anymore when sleeping with this big belly. I specially like the back support because I can put my weight on the pillow but still remaining on a side position. It is pretty big but It works out, I have a queen bed that I share with my husband and he's allright. I guess the pillow could be longer for leg support but it works out fine."
5,Can't live without it,"It is pretty big, but provides lots of support and comfort especially as you get bigger."
1,"Hard, Uncomfortable","I purchased this based on all of the wonderful reviews. I have been tossing and turning and am having nerve pain in my lower back, I am 5 mos pregnant.This pillow was terrible, I returned it. It was so hard I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible headache. Also the seam is in such a bad place that it pushes on your shoulder. I am picky with my pillows, if you are picky this may not be for you."
2,NOT Comfortable,"I thought this would be a great solution to my comfort issues I've been having in pregnancy but I was way wrong. The pillow is WAY too big & bulky & honestly, it's not comfortable at all. The cover is not soft & the pillow itself is too stiff to mold to your liking. Also, the head part is too bulky to use with your own pillow but too flat by itself. Altogether the pillow was wrong wrong wrong.I only gave it 2 stars because Amazon's shipping/cost was awesome as usual."
4,My nest!,"I feel like I'm sleeping in a plush little nest, so comfortable and supportive in all the right places. I can see how other reviewers have said the cover isn't the softest, and yes is a bit tight in the u-end of the pillow. I find it most comfortable with my shoulders on top of the U with a flattish down pillow on top of the Leachco pillow. The extra elevation helps my sinuses and alleviates the shoulder in the u-seam problem others have noted. Very happy with this pillow."
4,Can not sleep without this pillow,"I am 8 month pregnant now, I have been using this body pillow for a few months. It's great for legs and back support when you sleep, the only reason i give it 4 not 5 rate, it's because sometime if i sleep left hand side, my left arm feel numb when i woke up, and i can not find good position for my arms.Other than that, this boby pillow is great for pregnant women."
5,Probably the best pillow you can buy!,"Everyone is different in their sleep comfort and no pillow is perfect. It took me some time when I first got the pillow to find my method. (Believe me, I am very picky about sleep positions.)I lay the pillow with the open end at my head and touch the ends together. Then I lay my regular pillow just over the top. I kind of snuggle in between on my side with my legs on top of the bottom end of the pillow. It tooks a few nights to get used to sleeping with my legs slightly elevated and extra cusion under my neck, but now I love it. It is comparable to sleeping before pregnancy. I wish I would have had it with my first child!!Getting used to sleeping with a growing middle is a challenge. I really think this pillow provides the best support. Give it a few weeks and some different position tries and find what is best for you!"
4,Back n Belly Pillow,"My husband bought me this pillow when I started my 4th month of pregnancy and I started to experience backaches. As stated in previous posts, it is very large. We have a king size bed and it creates a nice little nook for me. The great thing about it is its versatility; you can turn and twist it into different shapes to suit your comfort."
5,I am finally getting some rest,"This pillow has helped me sleep during pregnancy. I no longer toss and turn all night long, and I no longer wake up every other hour to go to the bathroom. I am finally getting some rest at night (at least, until the baby is born!)."
4,Saved my back!,"I started getting horrible back pain while sleeping when I was only 12-13 weeks pregnant. After trying to find a store that carried maternity pillows with no luck, I ordered this one online. I hated having to wait a week to get it, but what a change it has made in my sleep! I am supported in a variety of positions and wake up with no back pain about 95% of the time. The downsides are that you probably will need a king size bed if you still want to sleep with your partner, and the case is difficult to get off and not very high quality fabric. Neither of those things is a reason not to get it if you are in pain, though."
4,Lower back pain disappeared!,"I've had the worst lower back pain since I found I was pregnant at 12 weeks. I bought this pillow at the beginning of my second trimester, and the pain in my lower back disappeared completely! I'm 32 weeks pregnant now, and the only complain I have is with the pillow case. I wish they would make it in cotton jersey because it's kinda hard to remove and replace the case when you want to wash it, especially if you're doing it by yourself. And a stretchable cotton pillow case would be more comfortable to sleep on. But I would recommend this pillow to every pregnant woman, if you've been missing a good night's sleep."
1,Had to return,The seam of the pillow cuts into your neck like a wire couldn't evern sleep one night with it...had to return :(
2,"Unusable ""As Is""","The base of this pillow is wonderful, it is the shape you need, gives you great support and almost makes sleeping comfortable again! However, the pillow case that comes with this pillow is terrible. It is a woven material and has a seam going through it that has no stretch whatsoever, and this seams digs into your neck all night long. One night I eventually got out a pair of scissors and cut into this seam all around the neck portion of the pillow to relieve some of the stress in the seam. Since then, the pillow case has ripped open more and more making it quite ugly, however, it is much more comfortable now.A jersey knit pillowcase is the answer to the seam problem. . . only no one makes it."
4,Very comfy but the seam..,"I am a crazy sleeper and I have been finding my self on my back or even on my stomach sometimes. I was worried I would hurt the baby. So I decided to get a body pillow. I agree with reviewers who did not like this because of the seam. The seam is very rough, and not well designed. However, it did not really bother me, only in a few positions. The pillow also helped my congestion, for the first time in months, I did not wake up with a terrible congestion. We are sharing a queen bed with my 6' husband, and he is happier than me as I can't kick him anymore :) The pillow splits the bed equally. UPDATE: do not wash the original cover. Putting the pillow back is a nightmare. It lost its shape a little."
1,Horrible! Don't waste your money!,"I wish I could give this pillow a 0-star rating. It seems from the reviews people either love it or hate it. I'm with the other reviewers when it comes to complaining about the seam that bites into your shoulder. No matter what I tried, the seam would cut into me. If I moved it far enough away so that it didn't cut in, then the pillow no longer reached to my legs. I'm not a tall person either ... 5'4"". The pillow was WAY overstuffed and I got a crick in my neck trying to lie on it. I tried turning it the other way (so that my head was at the open end), and it was just awkward. I tried it for several nights to see if it was a problem of getting used to it - I slept worse with the pillow than without (which is saying something). Also, it took up most of the Queen-sized bed. There was no sharing the bed with my husband when I used this pillow. I really regret buying this pillow. I ended up buying a body pillow for $20 and being much happier. Don't waste your money."
5,Amazing!!,"I ordered this when I was 32 weeks pregnant, and I am just hitting myself in the head for not getting it sooner. It helps me sleep better, helps with my acid reflex, and I actually am comfortable sleeping on my back, side and I can even sleep partially on my stomach with no discomfort at 36 weeks."
2,Not a Fan!,I purchased this in my 5th month of pregnancy to try and get some better sleep.I did not like it very much due to the length being too short (I'm 5'8)Also the material made me get hot.
5,Great pillow,This is the second pillow like this I have bought for my daughter-in-law. The first one was several years and 3 children ago needed a new one. She loves it.
5,love it!,"I ordered this pillow a little over a month ago because I was 5 months pregnant, not sleeping well & was having TERRIBLE hip pain from side-sleeping. It has done wonders for both the pain and the amount of sleep I get each night. It is pretty big, but fits fine on my side of our queen-size bed. My husband isn't the biggest fan because I'm separated from him now, but he's happy that I'm more comfortable & knows it's only temporary. I would recommend this to anyone because it has been the perfect solution for me!"
5,Worth the $,"I am in my 30th week and just started using this 2 weeks ago. It's so much better than propping 3-4 pillows all around while sleeping. It does take up alot of space in a queen-sized bed, but I've found my husband cozying up to it while sleeping, so I think it's fine for 2 regular-sized people in a queen. Trust me, this thing is heaven for the right person...I'm 5 ft 8 and it suits me fine, but a taller person could have a problem with it. They should create 2 different sizes and everyone would be happy!"
1,not for tall women,"I am 5'8"" and it just does not work well. If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled. I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great. I had high hopes for this but just not long enough. I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding."
2,Dissapointment of Pillow,"I had read all of the great reviews of the pillow and how comfortable it was, so trusting others I purchased the full body pillow. I must admit I was dissapointed because the pillow is just too big. It was hard to ""climb"" into the pillow once it was on the bed, and once I was snuggled within the pillow I felt confined and like I couldn't move. I just could not get comfortable and tossed the pillow to the floor after 15 or 20 minutes of use. I returned the pillow and purchased just the single-sided body pillow, which I LOVE! I would not recommend the full-body pillow unless of course you like being confined."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"I'm Pregnant & was having such horrible discomfort trying to sleep because my back, hip & shoulder were killing me. Well this thing rocks!! I am sleeping 100% better now. It's a little big (takes up 1/2 of our Queen size bed) but it is SO worth it!! I LOVE THIS THING and it is worth every penny paid for it!!!"
2,Not that great,"Save the money and buy a couple of body pillows instead. The thing about this pillow is that when you're pregnant and hulking and huffing your way through rolling over at night, you've got to do some major rearranging with this pillow, and by then you're more awake. I also find it more difficult to extract my pregnant self from this thing to check on my other child in the night. Sleep is too precious to waste on something like that. Body pillows are easier to work with and take up less room."
2,Review,"I found the pillow cover very itchy and not soft. Also, I thought I would like the contours, but I found it very restricive. the pillow is not long enough (and I am only 5'2""). I was very disappointed in this pillow."
4,Life saver during my last trimester,"This pillow absolutely made my last three months more comfortable. However, if you are using a queen size bed and wish to have your spouse/partner sleep in the same bed they better be really skinny or willing not to move the whole night. Also it gets really hot in summer as the pillow seems to hold on to the heat. Still a great buy in terms of comfort."
5,It helps me sleep as well as helps with pregnancy pains,I bought this pillow due to i was not sleeping very well i am 5 1/2 months pregnant and have back injuries so i was restless at night and since i have recieved the pillow i have slept wonderfully which i know my husband is happy now too :) and we have a king size bed so there is still plenty of room for him. i really recommend this product if you are looking for a body pillow.
3,Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow,"This maternity pillow is a great improvement over having nothing at all - or just a regular pillow between your legs, but I find that I still have to get another pillow to put between my back and the maternity pillow for support when I'm laying on my side because the back support is just not there for me - this is why I gave it only 3 stars.It's comfortable and better than nothing. I am happy I purchased it just wished it supported my back a little more."
5,Back and belly pillow,This is the greatest purchase of my entire pregnancy. This pillow provides my body with the extra support I need to sleep comfortably. I also look forward to using it for nursing when the baby is born. My husband and my dog love it too!
1,DON'T BUY THIS PILLOW!,"About five months into my pregnancy, I bought the Boppy Total Body Pillow. It worked great, but did flatten quickly and became very clumpy. So...now in my eighth month...I was having more trouble sleeping than before with lots of hip pain. So...I read reviews for this pillow thinking it would not lose its shape so quickly and would better support my back to aid in hip pain. Well...BIG MISTAKE! The pillow takes up way too much room in a queen size bed with my husband and I. It is stuffed too full so that it hurts your neck when you try to use it. Also, the length does not work for me (I'm 5'7""). No matter what I tried to do, I just couldn't get it in the right position. I ended up giving it to my non-pregnant, shorter sister. Hopefully someone will get something out of it. WASTE OF MONEY! I ended up just buying another Boppy Total Body Pillow, and that has been working well again. Hope this helps someone not make the same mistake."
4,Well Rested!,"I am 29 weeks pregnant and was having a ton of trouble sleeping. Befor pregnancy I always slept on my belly and have had a big problem getting used to sleeping on my side. My cousin recommended this pillow to me and love it. I can now get comfortable enough to fall asleep quickly and stay comfortable enough to sleep through the night. My one complaint is that the pillow is not long enough. If it were just a few inches longer, it would be perfect. But other than that, it has helped me so much. It is well worth the money."
5,A lifesafer for pregnant moms,"I purchased this pillow last week, and it has been a life saver. Being pregnant with twins, I was unable to find a comfortable way to sleep. Now, with this pillow I'm getting a great nights sleep, and some great naps too! I was initally worried to purchase the pillow because of the price, but it has proven to be well worth the money and then some. I would suggest this to anyone who is pregnant, it's much better than sleeping on the recliner. I do have to agree with other reviewers, once the family tries it out, they will all want this pillow!"
5,Blessing from Leachco,"This product is amazing. I bought this for my girlfriend who is two months into her second pregnancy. For our first child she just used one of those large body pillows that she said didn't give her enough support. She said this one supports her belly, back, and neck all at the same time. I love it because it keeps her from rolling around at night in bed and stealing all of the covers. It's a for sure buy!!!"
5,Reeeeal comfy...,"I'm 5'8"" 145 lbs and have just been having trouble sleeping since I got pregnant! Sore Hips!! This is a life-saver...My rotweiller agrees that its the best and is always trying to weasel his way in there with me!"
1,"too bulky, not soft and it got returned!","I was excited about this product, however, it did not meet up to my expectations. The seam, as everyone else complained about, was very rough and noticeable. The pillow is HUGE and took up 1/2 of my king size bed. The pillow is very bulky, which would provide support, but too big for me to get my legs over and rest there comfortably. It was actually hurting my hips to lay on it the way you're supposed to. I gave up on it after a few hours and returned it the following day. I'll be looking for something softer and more compact."
4,Helpful for backache and tummy sleepers,"I bought this over a month ago and wanted to make sure I've used it for enough time before I wrote a review. This body pillow is great, despite all the negative reviews. I am a tummy sleeper and this has really helped me to avoid sleeping on my stomach. Also, it gives just the right amount of support to avoid backache and other pregnancy-related aches and pains. I have to say I sleep much better with it than I did before I had a body pillow. My husband has tried it out as well and loves it too. The only downside is it takes up a lot of space on a queen size bed, but the hubby's should understand it's only for a matter of a few, sleep-necessary months :)"
2,Not meant for me,"The concept is fabulous, but the pillow didn't fit my body. The biggest problem was my neck. The top portion for resting the head is not shaped well. It forced my head to be at an odd angle and strained my neck. Also, the curves for forming the body are not a one size fits all. Also, it's a big production to get in and out of this big nest.In the end, I returned this pillow and recreated the concept myself by buying two body pillows at Target, one for each side of my body. This way I get to use my own preferred pillow for my head. And I can get out of bed easier by moving just the one pillow out of the way to get out. Very important since we pregnant women get up several times per night."
5,Aaaahhhmazing pillow!!,"I don't know how anyone can make it through their pregnancy without this pillow! Im not sure what all the fuss with the seam is about because I don't notice it at all. The amount of support is perfect and in just the right places, even my husband likes to lay snuggled up with it! (It also makes making love a lot more comfortable) I would highly recommend it!!"
2,Wasn't as good as I hoped,"I thought I would really like this one, but I found that I was constantly fighting it. I hated washing the cover, because it was such a huge pain to try to get it back on. Also, half of it kept sliding off the bed. It wasn't as comfortable as I hoped, and I couldn't seem to get it positioned correctly to help support my growing belly."
2,Not for me,I feel bad giving this two stars because I think it's just a preference thing. This was too much bulk to go under my head.
3,It's okay but as not as great as I expected,"I had a hard time deciding which pregnancy pillow to buy and chose this one because of the great reviews. When I first laid down on this pillow, it felt great but the novelty wore off after the first night. It's not a bad pillow but I can't use it the way it's pictured. I'm only 5'2"" but even I find this pillow to be not long enough. A lot of people also complain about the seam irritating your shoulder, which is true but since I'm a back sleeper, I've placed several pillows on top of the neck area in order to elevate my back. Also, now that I've used it for several months, I find that the polyester foam also flattens out and feels hard to lay directly on top of. I thought that the contoured back & belly shape would be great but in practical use, it's not actually all that useful -- I still have to use a regular pillow to place between my knees and underneath my belly."
2,Uncomfortable,"Well, its big and soft. It did support my back a bit. That's pretty much the end of the good points. I didn't sleep well at all. You need a really long neck to be comfortable using it. It dug into mine. Also, I'm a short person (barely over 5 feet tall). Yet this seemed too short for me too. I can only imagine the difficulty a taller person must have getting it between their knees."
3,Ouch my shoulder!,"This pillow is nice. It supports my back and belly at the same time. It also helps me to stay sleeping on my side, which doctors recommend during pregnancy. It is quite big, bulky, and heavy. I have a queen bed and there is hardly any room for my husband. The biggest complaint that I have is that the seam on the pillow cuts into my shoulder so badly. To remedy the situation, I sleep with it upside-down (with the bottom of the U shape between my legs). It works, but you don't get the same support as having the pillow right-side up the way it was intended. All in all, I still love it and am glad I bought it."
1,too big for me,This pillow was too overstuffed in the neck area for me to sleep on. I do usually use a pretty flat pillow so that may be part of the problem. It was also pretty hard to get in and out of because my bed is already pretty high with a big pillowtop etc... I ended up sending this back and that process was very easy with amazon quickly giving me a full refund minus return shipping. If you hate it you can always send it back :)
4,Great comfort and quality!,I will not sleep without this pillow! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it is rather large and takes up quite a bit of space while travelling.
4,wonderful,"Sleeping and pregnancy do not go well together, having this pillow has made it much better to sleep surrounding and supporting every inch of my body!"
4,"Pillow is great, but...","I really like this pillow but trying to put it back into the case after washing the case is an absolute nightmare. I have not been able to fit it back in properly. I contacted the manufacturer to see if a replacement with a zipper or other design is available and was told ""sorry"" - nothing else for this model is available."
5,Pregnancy pillow,"This pillow has severely relieved my sleep issues by 90%. Of course I still wake up several times a night to use the bathroom haha but I rate this pillow number 1 because I turn a lot in my sleep and this pillow comfortably forms to both sides of your body at all times. Even when I end up lying on my back it is extremely comfortable. I also have had several shoulder surgeries from sports injuries, plus now my lower back and neck ache in addition to the pregnancy and body changes, but this pillow takes care of these issues in order for me to get some actual rest!"
3,Only useful for 3 months,"I started using the pillow from 4mon preg when my belly started showing. It's nice at the beginning that I finally got support from the back (doesn't slide away as small pillows do). But I always felt I was trapped and it's an big effort to get in and out (I use bathroom at least 2-3 times during the night) and turn around. I am 7mon preg now and cannot fit in the pillow any more. Plus it's really warm (a little bit too warm) to sleep inside the pillow that I never need a cover in the NYC winter. So if you plan to use it in summer, make sure you have a strong A/C."
2,Not for sleeping,"I wouldn't suggest sleeping with this pillow.I was hoping this pillow would help with my hip pain and it didn't. The first night it ended up on the floor because I was so frustrated with it. I just couldn't get comfortable. The seams are hard and dig into your neck/shoulder. The material is scratchy. I tried covering it, but it just didn't help. The top part, where you put your head, is bulky and kinks your neck when laying on your side.I would suggest it for lounging around on.I do like lounging on it though. Since it's so big (wouldn't suggest for a queen size bed with a ""mover"" of a husband)the bulkiness provides a nice cushion when it's contorted.Also the pillow wasn't Ivory like noted, it was white, which wasn't a problem for me."
4,like it,"I love this pillow, it has helped my back pain and sleeping difficulties. I'm not pregnant but I locve this pillow."
3,Its ok but i woud buy Mom Cozy instead,"The pillow is too high on the neck, the first night felt so uncomfy but i got used to it so now its ok.i made a mistake to buy this one instead of Mom Cozy wich i heard its way better.this pillow has a trim that bothers my neck also.i would def. not buy again, but since i got it wrong is here and i couldnt return its ok! :/"
4,Great pillow,"This is the best thing ever, the only flaw I see and feel is that the rounded corners of the pillow are very tight and have a hard seam but the only time you would really notice is if you have 2 people using the pillow at once lol other then that this is a great pillow and helps so much for sleep when pregnant"
4,AWESOME.,"All of my sleepless pregnant nights disappeared as soon as I got this pillow. I am certain even after I have my baby, I will continue sleeping with it. It does my make my husband jealous though, I no longer lay across him for comfort. :)"
4,Comfort for Sciatic Nerve Pain,"I got this pillow for my first pregnancy because I was having trouble sleeping and had sciatic nerve pain at the end of the pregnancy. If you fold the 2 long sides together and use it to snuggle and prop your leg over, you will sleep amazing, and won't feel the sciatic nerve pain. That is why I gave this 4 stars. If you use it that way, it's a gem, if you use it as a ""U"" shape it's a bit uncomfortable. BUT regardless I couldn't live without it. I am prego with #2 and got the sciatic nerve pain much earlier and had to start using this right away. CAN'T live without it."
4,wife loves it,my 6+ month pregnant wife loves this. It was a bit difficult to get the cover on and off for cleaning though..
2,pregnancy pillow,This body pillow was great at first. I was 7 months pregnant when I purchased it. I am now 8 months and the pillow has gone completely flat on both sides. This is where you need support for your belly.
2,"good quality, poor design","I was very excited and impressed with the quality when I opened the box, and couldn't wait for bedtime! BUT once in bed, I realized it was MUCH too large, and MUCH too thick. I was stuck in it, and if you are anything like me and have to pee anywhere from 5-9 times in the middle of the night, you may need diapers. I would have had to wake up my husband to help me out of the pillow in order to get up. The thickness at the head is extreme, and if you are already having back pain it only makes it worse. I tried flipping it upside down and putting my own pillow in the space, but that didn't work either b/c the thick part was between my thighs, making it too uncomfortable. I didn't even sleep with it one night, and I am in the process of returning it now. The quality is impeccable, but the design needs to be altered."
1,Not made for tall girls,I bought this pillow and took it out of the package laid down with it for 5 mins and was irritated. I put the pillow between my knees as shown and the pillow would dig into my neck and shoulder. I then placed it back in the box and returned it. If your tall then this pillow is not for you.
1,not worth it,"I am six months pregnant and recently purchased this massive pillow. It's not worth it. If I used the top of the horse-shoe as a pillow for my head then I got a very stiff neck and the sides just pused away so it didn't support my back at all. If I flipped it over the sides still spread giving no back support and it was a chore to get in and out of bed. Becasue it really gave no back support I wish I had just purchased a regular one-sided body pillow. Also, as far as using the thing for breast-feeding - No. It's HUGE. A boppy is much easir and takes up 1/10 of the space."
2,Not So Great For Hip Pain,"I bought this pillow because in my 5th month I was experiencing hip pain that was keeping me up at night. I thought this pillow could help, but unfortunately it did not help the hip pain at all. I found sleeping on the couch a much better solution. On the couch I could wedge my hip down between two soft cushions and that worked much better for me.The pillow was WAY to big for me - I am a petite person. Everytime I used it I felt like it swallowed me up. Then when I had to get up at night to use the bathroom it was very hard to get in and out of. The pillow was also not very soft so it caused neck pain as well.I'm sure this pillow would be great for someone with other pregnancy symptoms, but if you are experiencing the hip pain (and if you have it, you know what I am talking about), I would not suggest it - total waste of money."
3,Could Be Better....,"I bought this pillow in my 8th month because I couldn't take the hip and back pain anymore. It has eliminated my back pain and reduced my hip pain. Down side is it lacks neck support. It's also very hot to sleep in, but that may just be me. Also I've only had it for about 3 weeks and part of it is starting to flatten out."
4,Great pillow,"I am very happy with Back-n-Belly Contoured Pillow. I like not having to use a lot of pillows and having to readjust everytime I roll over. My only complaint is, it is a little short."
5,Wonderful Pillow,"I was desperate to find anything that would help me get to sleep at night during my pregnancy and this pillow is the answer! It is bulky and takes up alot of room, but it truly is comfortable and helps with back/hip pain."
5,"Now, I can sleep!","The pillow was very helpful. It supports your back, neck and shoulders well. I really liked it during the second trimester when I was adjusting to sleeping on my sides. It works much better than the two other body pillows I tried to use first before I bought this pillow. I like the fact that I can't kick it away from my body while I sleep. (I do that when I use a bunch of standard size pillows positioned all around me.)The only draw back is that is very difficult for your sleeping partner to cuddle with you. My husband hates the pillow, but I LOVE it. I end up using it for 2/3 of the night and then use him as a pillow for the rest of the morning."
3,Good pillow but...,"a little too thick and not long enough. My neck hurt from being propped up so high the first time I used it. Besides, it wasn't long enough to wrap comfortably around my knees between the legs. However back support was good. Maybe after much use, it won't be so thick and high and serve better but for now I'm back to using my regular pillows."
4,Amazing!,"This back n belly is amazing, i actually bought it for my bf for valentines day, and the only problem we had with it, is that he was cuddling it all night instead of me!! Anyway it is super comfy and really good for support of your spine and the natural flow of your body. We all take turns with it. The only thing is it is rather large and can take up a lot of room in your bed!"
4,Baby Mama Dream Come True,"I ordered this pillow because my hips started going to sleep during the night starting week 20 of my pregnancy. I was having a tough time converting from a stomach sleeper to a side sleeper with a standard body pillow between my legs for support. Every time I turned over or changed positions I would wake up because my body pillow didn't move with me very well. This Leachco Back'N Belly pillow solved that problem!Because of it's U-shape the pillow stays where you need it to and is on either side of my body all night. So, no matter which way I turned it was there! No readjusting all night. Also, it provides just the right amount of support under a hip that I can turn ever so slightly onto my back to get relief and blood flow to my hips. It allows you the support under your hip so that you don't sleep flat on your back."
2,Seam was painful,"The concept is awesome, and the back and belly/leg support is great. But there is a neck seam that DIGS into your neck if you sleep on your side with your legs/back touching the pillow. If they could fix this one error, I think it would be a fabulous product. I didn't want to cut the seam and deal with the fuzz all over. Not for 60/70 bucks."
5,Pregnant with Baby #5 and Wishing I bought this with Baby #1,"I am currently pregnant with my 5th child. In all of my previous pregnancies, I have just stuffed pillows all around and ""made do"". My hips were always hurting and I didn't get great sleep at the end of the pregnancy. I had seen these back n belly pillows, but I just couldn't spend the money on it. Finally with Baby #5, my husband said, just buy the pillow. Boy am I glad I listened to him! This pillow is so comfortable and supportive. I have no pain or discomfort when I sleep and I am now in my 8th month of pregnancy. If you are like me and debating spending the money on it, DO IT! You will not regret it. I only wish I would have bought this pillow with Baby #1!"
1,I wished it had worked!!,"90 % of the pillow was great, super comfy, but just like many of the other reviewers there is the issue of where you place your head.1st: is it way too stuffed to be comfortable for neck2nd: when you lay your head down there IS a really thick hard seam that actually presses downward into your neck/shoulders so much so that it is surprising and way too much to ignore.I considered making a vertical split in the seam, unstuffing some of it, adding a little fabric and sewing it back up b/c the rest of the pillow was sooo comfy around my belly and back but there was no way to sleep with it unfortunately so it got returned :(Using 1 flat body pillow with a few others behind me, making it work for the moment. If they ever fix this defect mentioned in many other reviews it will be absolutely worth it!!"
3,only one problem,I like the pillow with one exception. The top area where you neck lies is straight across. It pulls taught and makes it feel as if your neck is sleeping on a rope. It is very uncomfortable. I have to put a blanket there for padding. I would also suggest having a king size bed. We have a queen and between me and that pillow my poor hubby is nearly falling off the bed.
4,Sister loves it!,"I purchased this for my sister and she loves it! She began using it when she was 6 months pregnant and she said that it really helped her sleep better at night! Excellent product! Would recommend purchasing extra cases for it or making your own. Her husband loves the pillow also and he's 6' tall, so the size is great for both of them!"
3,May work for some,"I really wanted this pillow to work.. I am on my second pregnancy and experienced a lot of hip and pelvic pain from sleeping during my last pregnancy, so when I started experiencing pain earlier the second time around I really wanted to find a solution. Unfortunately, pregnancy pillows just do not work for me :(I find that the part that bends around your head to be awkward and too confining. I also need to sleep more elevated than this, so even with adding pillows under my head I still couldn't find good places to put my arms.I'm also realizing that because I am already hyper mobile, having my ligaments loosen up even more during pregnancy just makes things ache worse than the average person. For me, having my knees separated and something under my back gave me back pain and made my hips feel worse.Wish I were someone who could use one of these and feel great, but I'm not! Best of luck to those of you who want to give it a try!"
1,Not worth $60.00!,"I saw all of the positive reviews for this body pillow and drooled over it for some time. It seemed like the best one on amazon. Boy, was I wrong! I'm pregnant and the first night I slept on it was horrible. I woke up with pains in my shoulders from the seams so I removed the cover that came with it as I had read about in other reviews. The next night, same thing. After a week of this I finally gave up. It takes up most of a queen sized bed and I found it didn't give me any support where I needed it. I'm 5'5 1/2'' and slender. No matter what position I was in the pillow was still very uncomfortable. I put it in my daughter's room. Seems the only thing in this house who liked it were the cats. Now it is just taking up space. I would recommend buying a body pillow without any seams in it because for me it just cut into my neck and shoulders all night long."
4,So helpful!,"This pillow has been quite the godsend for me during my pregnancy. I was experiencing SUCH back and hip pain before I got it, and now I'm much more comfortable.Caveats--it IS enormous. Yep, it takes up more than half of our queen sized bed; but my husband is very understanding (who wouldn't be?). That said, I miss cuddling with him instead of the pillow, but that's hardly the pillows fault.Also, yeah, the cover is annoying scratchy when you first get it. So you do what you do with most items of this nature and WASH it. Hasn't bothered me since.Oh, and I'm 5'11"", and although IMO it could stand to be a little longer for the freakishly tall like myself, I have no problem with it.My biggest regret with this product? That I didn't get it sooner."
1,Painful seam,I was really excited about this pillow since I flip from side to side. It would have been perfect with the exception of a seam on the inside where your neck lies when you are resting your head on the pillow. All night long this seam dug into my neck. It caused more pain then I was feeling from the pregnancy discomfort. I thought for sure this was a defect. I sent it back and asked for a new one. I got the new one and realized it was not a design flaw. I sent it back. Now I am back to the drawing board. I cannot understand how no one else is having this problem.
4,Comfortable,"This pillow is very comfortable. I would give it a 5, but the pillow case isn't as soft as I would've liked. Plus, it is a little overpriced."
5,Best pillow ever,"I love this pillow. I'm 6 months prego and started getting cramping and charlie horses in my legs, but since i purchased this everything on my body has felt better. My hubby tries to steal this pillow from me that's how great it is :) I definitely recommend."
3,Too much pillow,"While this pillow offers a lot of support I found it restrictive and a little overwhelming. I also did not like the the stitching on the inside seam; particularly where my neck would rest because it would cut into my neck as I tried to sleep. Overall, this pillow was too cumbersome and the stitching too tight. I prefer the Snoogle."
3,Zzzzz...,"This pillow is great with a few drawbacks...- The cover is difficult to remove for washing and even harder to put back on, so it's best to either make something or cut the end from an old pillowcase to cover the head area.- The filling deflates easily, so if this is something you are sleeping on every night, the head portion will need something beneath it within a month.- The cover isn't very soft, I would say about 150 TC or less.Other than these issues, the body pillow is very comfortable and doesn't ""run away"" overnight!"
3,Good pillow - crap sewing,I found the pillow good sturdy and snug but the one let down was the filling is smaller than the lining and the stitching around where your neck and shoulder goes is very tight so it was cutting off my circulation. I plan to cut it open and place a soft cotton panel about 2 inches wide in so it is easier in my neck and shoulder and the pillow stuffing actually supports my neck.
5,loving it,do not regret buying this product at all. i get more than enough sleep as opposed to my last pregnancy. supports my back everything
3,Almost perfect!,"I'm 6 months pregnant and have been using various pillows for head/body/legs, including a ""Made for TV"" side sleeper pillow. The one I've been using is U-shaped but uneven, so each time I turn over I need to turn the pillow. However, it also has an ""ear well"" - an indentation that keeps my ear from getting sore while sleeping so much on my side.I had hubby buy the Leachco for me so I could have one big pillow that doesn't need to be turned over in the night. I love it so much - EXCEPT that my ears start hurting in a matter of minutes. I've tried making it work for a couple of nights, but I'm starting to lose hope - I just end up with this other small softer pillow, in the middle of this huge leacho thing that just isn't working out :-(This pillow would be SO PERFECT if they added that ""ear well"" feature!"
4,Comfy enough for the misses,"Bought it for my wife who is expecting: she really likes it, finds it very comfy and useful. The only negative point is how it separates us in the bed!"
1,NOT THAT GREAT,"Doesn't live up to the hype all these women are raving about. I've used this since I was 10 weeks preg (when I started having trouble sleeping) and I am 24 weeks now. I'm not going to stop using it because I paid +$70 for it (ugh!). I'm a back sleeper and since preggos aren't supposed to sleep on their backs, I bought this to help me get comfy trying to sleep on my sides. Nope. Not comfy."
4,my BFF during pregnancy!!,"Starting my 3 month of pregnancy, my lower back pains got so severe that I was having a difficult time sleeping. After going through TONS of product reviews, my dear husband got me the Leachco Back 'n Belly Contoured Body pillow. This pillow was a LIFE SAVER!! I wasn't able to sleep on my side, as recommended during pregnancy because my sides would become sore, which left me the option of sleeping on my tummy or sleeping on my back- neither which is comfortable nor good for the baby. But with this pillow, I was able to prop up the top part to support my back and sleep at in incline. Sounds uncomfortable, but it worked for me till the day a daughter came out into the world! It truly became my new bed BFF. It was so comfortable that I would catch my husband napping in/on it! I still use it when I'm lounging on the bed, though it is no longer a permanent resident on the bed because it is a bit large and cumbersome."
3,U seam cuts into neck!,"I had a snoogle during my 1st pregnancy and preferred it to this one.I just recently bought this Leachco Back N Belly pillow to try it since I had to use an extra pillow on my back or belly with the snoogle to cover both sides.When used with the U shape at your head, the inside seam cut into my neck badly. I tried it upside down for a while and it seemed to not hit in the right places.Since I also like my own pillow for my head, I ended up cutting the top part out and putting each side in a king size pillow case. I might have been better off to just pay $10 each for 2 body pillows at walmart!!!I do love the contours that it gives to my belly and back. Supports right where it is needed.I feel that Leachco should figure out a way for the inner seam to be stretchy or something so that it doesn't cut into one's neck."
3,Great pillow but the seam ruined it,"A lot of reviews said that this pillow was great and comfortable but a few mentioned the seam. I still bought it thinking that maybe it wasn't so bad. After 3 nights of trying it out, I can't get over the seam issue. I'd wake up with a sore neck and shoulder from the seam just cutting into my neck. It did help with my hips though. It was really comfortable having the front and back support but the seam...the seam just ruined it all."
3,so so,"i read the reviews before i bought this pillow. Some people complained about the zipper/lining that bothers you by the neck, i don't have that problem, as mine is pretty smooth. However i also read that the pillow is not stiff enough that after a few weeks or so, it flattens. It's true. The picture seems a little misleading that i saw the mother feeding the baby and it looks pretty buffed. I wanted a stiff pillow but this is not working for me. It's now only good for me to put my legs around it. I like it the fact that you can turn around and still have the pillow there to wrap my legs around it. I could prob buy 2 regular pillows and have the same thing that i wanted"
5,Best thing I've bought this pregnancy,"I'm now 35 weeks pregnant, but my husband bought me this pillow when I was around 18 weeks. I don't know how I would have made it through this pregnancy without this pillow. You have to trial different ways of using it to see what will work best for you. I put a pillow on top of the head pillow and then scoot up so that my shoulder is just barely resting in the cutout. This way you don't deal with shoulder pain from the cover.I sleep through the night and don't wake up to rearrange pillows every time I turn over. It also supports you well under your big belly and from the back. My husband is 6'2"" and we have a queen bed, and it hasn't been a problem at all. He still has plenty of space, or else snuggles up next to me and the pillow.I highly recommend this pillow to get the most needed and elusive thing during pregnancy...sleep!!"
2,Doesn't Deliver Enough Back Support for Severe Back Pain,"My wife is 8 months pregnant and is having severe back pain. I bought this pillow for her thinking that its wrap around back support would relieve some of her pain. Unfortunately, this pillow didn't ease my wife's pain at all and we returned it after just a few days."
1,"Don't Buy Leacho Products, Terrible Customer Service","I only had the Back n Belly pillow for one month when the pillow wasn't full any more, thus not providing the support that it did when I first bought it. I contacted Leachco and they told me they couldn't replace it, you had to bring it back to the place you bought it. I bought my pillow online at Target, so I would have to pay for shipping charges again if I wanted to try another pillow. Leachco has terrible customer service, the worst I have ever experience.Save your money and buy from a different company, their products are over-price and aren't made well!"
1,Oversized and oddly shaped,"I was very disapointed with this product. It is very oddly shaped, meaning when you try to lay down the pillow is very uncomfortable by the neck. It digs into your neck. The back of the pillow doesn't stay in place. The other issue I have is my husband and I have a queen size bed, it doesn't leave any room for him to sleep on the bed. The pillow takes up most of the bed, unless you have a California King I would not recommend getting this Pillow"
3,Great for naps,"I was so excited to get this pillow that when it arrived next day, I went straight upstairs to take a nap with it. For short periods of sleep, this is totally ideal. The one part that I find really uncomfortable is the lining around the neck. It is very tight and digs into the neck. It shouldn't be this way, I'm assuming. What I mean is that its really hard to snuggle deep into and have your face on the top part of the pillow. This pillow would be 100% perfect if it weren't for this one flaw."
4,Good product!,"Overall, a nice product for support. I agree with several others about the tight seam at the top. You can't really understand the issue until you feel it, but I don't sleep with my shoulder nestled right into the top of the pillow anyway, so it's not a huge issue for me. The contoured sides don't stay under your back and belly, they shift away during the night, which is to be expected. Overall, though, it's a LOT better than having 3 or 4 pillows surrounding you. It's very big, taking up half of my queen bed, but hey, it's my half! Nice product for hip, back, and belly support during pregnancy!"
5,Great Pillow!,This pillow was incredible during the later stages of pregnancy. There are so many different positions you can use it to get comfortable in. It provided the belly support I was looking for and gave me relief for my hips (which had begun to ache badly from only being able to sleep on my sides).In regards to the seam: I don't know if there was a slight re-design or not. The seam is still in the same place but I have never had any issues with it...I have never felt it while choosing a position and it has never caused me to wake up out of sleep.The best part is my husband snuggles the opposite side so we can still be close while sleeping. He says its super comfortable too! I'm very happy with this purchase.
1,Did not work at all,"I tried this pillow during my pregnancy at various stages and it did nothing for me. It is gigantic and hard to move around. It is overstuffed and uncomfortable. All of the curves hit me at the wrong places, maybe I am too tall for this pillow at 5'9"". It is expensive and costs a lot to ship back, so make sure you really, really want this big uncomfortable pillow before you buy it."
5,Top 10 items to have when pregnant,"I sleep great now! Before this pillow, I just a straight body pillow. Everytime I wanted to roll over I had to take my blanket off, and move my pillow to the other side, and put the blanket on again. How annoying! I got this pillow at about 34 weeks pregnant, I'm just over 38 weeks now and this pillow has been a lifesaver. For anyone that wants to get some sleep before baby arrives, I highly recommend it!!!"
3,Not that comfortable,"I thought this would be the perfect pillow even when the pregnancy is over. The size of the pillow upset my husband (we have a King-sized bed). The nights that I slept with this I woke up too hot...so did my husband. If it were longer and not wider it might stand a chance (I am 5'7""). The head section has extremely tight fabric and not enough filling so it is very hard and not ergonomic. I find it comfortable flipped around for reading in bed. I plan to use it for nursing or maybe I can turn it into a toddler chair or something. I plan on purchasing another for sleeping :("
4,I can finally sleep through the night again!,"I am very pleased with this pillow. I was hesitant to order it as I am almost 6' tall and many reviews said it did not work for tall women. Well it works for me! I don't sleep exactly like the woman in the picture does, but it really supports my back and my belly. After tossing and turning for weeks, I am finally sleeping the night again, which has really helped with my daytime pregnancy aches and pains. My only complaint would be what others have said about the case. It really does not come off and then back on again. I find it a little gross to not be able to take it off and wash it (& then get it back on right!). But for now, I am sleeping again and that's the most important thing! As for the size, it is quite large, but I have a king sized bed and my husband says it doesn't bother him at all. I can see how it would be a tough fit in a smaller bed though."
4,Love the pillow,"I love this pillow, it is a life saver. One small set back is its hard to get in and out of bed in the middle of the night for the inevitable frequent bathroom runs, but otherwise it has helped me imeasurably to get comfortable and get a good nights sleep. I imagine the one sided one would be just as good."
2,Simple design flaw impacted usability,"We ordered this pillow for my wife who is now 5 months pregnant. She found the legs of the pillow to be comfortable; cradling both her back and belly while on her side. But the inside ""curve"" of the top of the pillow where you rest your head has a straight seam (it's deceiving in the picture, the picture angle makes it look curved) that digs painfully into the curve of her neck when laying on her side. Since the pillow can't be returned for hygiene reasons, we are now stuck with a sizable pillow that she can't use. It might be good for breastfeeding support after the birth, but given the purchase need was for sleep support, it's very disappointing that the designers overlooked the painful impact of the straight seam."
3,"Great at first, but flattens over time","This pillow was wonderful when I got it, I really liked that I didn't have to move the pillow from side to side if I flipped over. But the filling really doesnt hold up well at all, and after just a couple months it gets pretty flattened especially as your belly grows. I'm at the end of my pregnancy now, and I really wish it still had the filling like when I got it because now is when my back is hurting the worst. I dont want to buy another pillow at this point, so I am jsut toughing it out...."
1,HUGE!,This pillow is HUGE and I have a king size bed! I am 22 weeks pregnant and I got SO HOT using this pillow that I returned.
5,Like a pregnancy cocoon!,"I initially did not want to buy one of these pillows because I thought they were sort of silly. Boy was I wrong! The pillow is firm enough that it doesn't go flat when you're all wrapped around it. I also like that the cover comes off for washing (although it is white, which is kind of a bummer). All of the different positions you can use this pillow in make it very versatile. Even my husband wants one!The only con is this pillow is HUGE. I sleep in a queen sized bed, but anything smaller would probably be too small."
1,Cuts into your neck,"Love the idea of this pillow - but ouch! The seam that hits the back of your neck couldn't be place in a worse position. It was super uncomfortable. Additionally, I think it's important for buyers to know that this pillow has lots of fill. So for those of you like me who like their pillows squishy - this is not the one for you - it's really thick. Good idea Leachco, but poor execution. Had to send this pillow back the very next day."
2,Not impressed,"I ordered this product based on all the great reviews and ignored the bad ones. I was excited when this pillow first arrived and couldn't wait to try it.The first thing I noticed was the seam in the ""U"" part. When I lay my head there the seam digs into my neck. It's as if the seam is sewed to tightly making it to taught. It just digs in making it very uncomfortable. Also, the pillow case is almost impossible to put back on once removed. I was only 18 weeks pregnant when I struggled with this so I was able to finally get it back on eventually but if I was much bigger I would have to get someone else to change the pillow case.I would not recommend this pillow to a friend. I just ordered another (more expensive) one from Amazon. Hopefully this turns out to be what I am hopeing for."
2,My wife did not like it,"I bought this pillow for my wife who is 6 months pregnant with twins, because she had difficulty sleeping and had constant back pain. She is maybe 5'4"" with a slim build. She did not like this pillow and was never able to find a comfortable position with it. She used it for about 2 weeks and now just uses a pile of regular pillows. I think she finds the propped-up position better and she can not get that with this pillow. That being said, my 3 year old loves it. He likes to sleep in the middle of it. I guess he likes to snuggle with it."
2,Dosent last long...,I bought this pillow just before i got pregnant. Sadly it didnt even last all the way throught the pregnancy before it started bunching. I have had it less than a year and it has some spots with no fill and some with lots. It is to bulky so you have to lift up one side to get in and out of bed which makes breaks in the fill. After less than a year most of the fill has gone flat.The pillowcase is very difficult to get on and off and it ripped trying to get it over the pillow. Can you say zipper?I am going to purchase a diffent brand of full body pillow that comes apart and has a zippered pillowcase.Shop around before you buy!
2,Too big for comfort,I bought this for my wife who was uncomfortable with her pregnancy while sleeping. Once opened it can not be returned but in the box it is folded so it was hard to tell its size. It is huge and she complained about it after trying it for only a few moments. She wanted me to return it but it was opened and I decided not to. She tried it the other night for a full night and was not real happy. On another note her 17yr old cat likes it so if you want a 55 dollar cat pillow it was worth it.
2,Not so great,"I purchased this pillow in hopes of relieving lower back pain. I was in the middle to end of my second trimester when I purchased the pillow and it seemed to work great for a couple of days, but then the back pain came back. I also found that the pillow was a bit uncomfortable in spots and didn't provide enough support for my head. I have now ditched my back and body pillow and am using 3 individual pillows for the time being. It might be that I simply need to rotate back and forth once my body gets used to something for a while. I just didn't feel this helped me out as much as i was hoping it would."
2,I was very disappointed,"I was really excited about getting this pillow in the mail. I thought it was going to be great and help me sleep better. Unfortunately, it has too much stuffing and it elevates my head too high, therefore hurting my neck. It's so big that it hurts my arms if I leave them underneath the pillow and it's uncomfortable if I try to keep my arms within the pillow or on top of it. I was very disappointed with this expensive purchase, but am hopeful that it will come in handy when I am breast feeding my baby. It is also really big and hard to store until the baby arrives. So that's annoying too."
3,"Seam is horrendous, but great comfort if you cut off the seam","The seam of the pillowcase at the neck part of the pillow cuts into my shoulder quite a bit. I cut the seam off and put a pillow case over the top, which solved that problem, but left the pillowcase underneath ripping every time I turned over. I think the idea is great but the design needs A LOT of work around the head area. Besides the now ripping pillowcase, I love this pillow. It supports my back and belly and prevents me from rolling onto my back accidentally in my sleep. This pillow will work if you cut off the top part of the case and keep the case covering only the sides. Then cut a regular pillowcase so it's open on both ends and slip it over the pillow to the top. Since you have to do this to the pillow I do not think it is worth $60."
2,Not a product for everyone,"I was hoping this would help me sleep more comfortably and help my back but it did the opposite. I went from slight back pain to sciatica that caused me to not be able to walk for 2 days. I am not saying that the pillow caused it, but it certainly didn't help it."
2,"Polyester cover, weird contour pokes at stomach","First, polyester cover - scratchy and not very soft.Secondly, there is a weird contour of the pillow that pokes right at your stomach. I don't know why they contoured it this way. Is this supposed to support your breasts? If so, it's in the wrong place.Lastly, too short! I'm only 5'2 and I really have to bend my knees inorder for my legs to be supported by this."
