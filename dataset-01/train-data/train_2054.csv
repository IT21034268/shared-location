2,Disappointed....,"It had a few funny moments in it, but I found that it just lagged on and on. It became very boring to me. I ended up falling asleep while watching it. I only do that when a movie doesn't hold my interest."
1,More stupid than funny.,"There were some laugh out loud moments, but overall a very boring movie. Sorry Jason, not your best work. Not your best work at all."
1,Disappointing,"A Nicholas Stoller with Jason Segel movie seemed like a good choice. Their track record is amazing. However, this two and a half hour movie felt like weeks. The plot line isn't focused, it isn't funny on any level and doesn't seem to have a point."
1,Bad quality!,"Although I paid extra for HD quality, the video was far from it!! I had used VUDU to rent a movie the previous night (on the same tv and internet) and the quality was far superior. The movie itself was funny but could hav ebeen edited down a bit. It dragged at times... Siegel is hilarious though!!"
1,Truly awful,This movie was a complete waste of time and seemingly talented actors. It was so bad my wife and I were unable to finish it. A trainwreck by all accounts. Don't waste your money or time on this garbage.
5,Excellent film,"Enjoyed the film: solid acting, intriguing plot. I especially enjoy romantic comedies, and I found this one to be quirky, engaging, and fun."
2,Drags and the plot is weak,"This movie really tried hard to be a comedy. But, the funny scenes aren't enough to carry the rest of the film. We finished it out of pure stubbornness, but we all lost interest pretty quickly."
1,So wanted to love this movie,I so wanted to love this movie since I love Jason Segal and Emily Blunt but it was horrible. It wasn't even funny and it's called the Five-Year Engagement but it should be called What Not to Do in a Relationship.
3,So-so,Huge Jason Segel fan and this movie was kind of depressing at times but its worth a rent for sure
2,five year engagement,"not very good. over the top in parts and way too long. usually like jason segal, but this one was a bit of a bust"
4,Five Year Engagement.,Very funny and very intertaining. Really enjoyed this movie. Good laughs all through.Would recommmend to all my friends. Loved it.
2,"I thought this was another movie, it popped up as a suggestion but didn't notice it wasn't the right one until it was delivered.","Thought this was the popular one with the line ""Help me I'm poor."" It turns out that it was just a suggestion that automatically popped up when I typed in the movie that I really wanted. As I mentioned above, I didn't notice it wasn't the intended movie until I got it home and started watching it... I watched it since I bought it, more of a rent than buy type movie."
2,Boring,"Kept hoping it would pick up, but I just got so depressed by it that I stopped watching it. Oh well."
4,A rom-com that rings true.,"A young couple plan on getting married, but life gets in the way. Their relationship gets rocky, as they begin to grow apart. They face a dilemma that is presented by a career opportunity for the woman, which forces the lovers to decide if their planned marriage can proceed. The question on every viewers mind is ""will they end up together?"" Reminiscent of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, though not quite as good, this movie is an entertaining diversion. There are some solid laugh-out-loud moments, and the chemistry between the onscreen actors is apparent. Featuring situations that many modern couples may find familiar, this is a realistic romantic-comedy that will keep you laughing."
1,Expired,Movie expired before I watched it. I must not have been paying close enough attention to the time frame of watching. Or it expired pre-maturely.
1,Brutal,"Wife and I were searching for something new to watch on a Friday night. We both liked Jason Segal and ""Forgetting Sara Marshall"" and thought this might have similar humor. We were surprised how bad this movie was. The story is all over the place and not very well executed. Bad chemistry between the actors. It was just bad. Don't waste your time."
1,Not good,"We rented this movie because we remembered seeing funny commercials for it when it came out. Apparently, those were the only funny scenes! I normally don't leave reviews, but I do read them. Someone else was right when they said they felt like this movie took five years to watch! Boring and too long"
3,I don't know what I had imagined for this movie...,"Just was not thrilled, but I was bored so I guess I did get to pass some time away. This movie was just okay (eh) to me."
1,The five-year engagement,The is the worst movie my family have seen in a long time. I thought I got a lot older watching this movie-- it seemed like 5 years...........
3,Not bad but...,Not a bad but movie it seemed like it just went on and on. I started to wonder if the movie had an end to it.
4,H-I-Larious,"If you have a girl crush on Emily blunt, as I do, then you can't not enjoy this movie. I laughed through most of it."
2,Disappointing,This had very few funny moments. It was also too long.Would not recommend if you are looking for a good laugh.
4,Entertaining,Good movie - entertaining. Not as good as Bridesmaids but worth $4.00 !Emily Blunt is good in this as well as Jason Siegel (sp?)
3,OK,This movie is Somewhat funny at the beginning and then starts to get a little crazy. Would not buy it but was a good rent
3,funny but it dragged,It was good for the most part but there were some parts that dragged on. I like Jason Segel in this movie but not a far stretch from his other characters.
3,Watched it with my Boyfriend,"Not bad. Good twist. Not the usual chick flick. But, my boyfriend still felt it was a chick flick. I didn't feel that way. :) Loved that it was not the perfect, New York, double income couple...which as we all know is 90% of all Americans, right?"
2,Disappointing...,"I can say for 100% certainty what I was expecting when I chose this one, but I found myself a little annoyed going round and round with the plot. it felt just a bit like they needed to stretch it out so they kept painstakingly adding more dramatics. the end was cute and very welcome. subtle hints of funny, but the majority is a bit challenging to watch."
3,Cute movie,"It was a very cute movie. Perfect for one of those days where you just need to find something to watch and relax to. Don't expect something completely out of this world, but it's still a good/fun watch."
2,Preview covered it all,The preview covered every possible point you might like about this movie. It was a waste of money. Thank goodness I didn't see it at the theaters. Ugh.
2,Not what I hoped,"I just could not get into this movie. Funny sometimes but very bored. Hubby was bored after 30 minutes. Sorry, wish it would have been better."
3,Not terrible,"For a chick-flick, it was a pretty good movie. You know, standard formula for the romantic comedy. Things are good, then things are bad, everybody learns stuff, then things end good. The middle part on this one - where they fell apart and forgot what it was all about- dragged on a bit. They could have trimmed out 20 minutes of the middle.Our picture quality from the Amazon rental was terrible. We don't get this problem when we stream from Netflix or CinemaNow."
2,Too long and rather boring,"I am a fan of almost every actor in this movie, but it is just too long and quite boring."
2,Surprisingly lame and boring,"I thought this would be a cute but not too cute movie to watch, and I like Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. However, the writing wasn't very good, there was a lot of stuff that was just dumb, and I didn't even finish watching it. It wasn't worth 3.99 for me."
3,"If you hang in there long enough, you'll get a couple of memorable moments","If you can stay awake / sit through the first quirky drawn-out 1 hour 55 minutes, the last 9 minutes make it totally worth it! You'll get two different perfect moments - one between Elmo and Cookie Monster that is at the level of when Harry Met Sally and the woman next door orders what she is having (Meg Ryan's orgasmic response to your luncheon order). The second perfect moment is totally creative and ties in all the previous doldrums you saw in this movie if you were able to stay awake and pay attention."
2,Pure Dreck,"i was expecting to see a light-hearted Romantic Comedy but instead this was the Worst Dramedy I have seen in years. It was painful to watch the actors struggle with this poor script and bad characterization. this movie was advertised as a comedy but frankly as a divorce I found it all too depressingly real. No escape from the daily troubles here, you will find yourself wishing someone would violently murder the main characters or a plane drops on your house just to keep one from having to finish the movie."
1,Don't waste your time...,I talked my husband into watching this with me as it seemed from previews that it would be pretty funny. It had some funny parts but in general was pretty ridiculous and it seemed as if the movie lasted five years. Boring. Not recommended.
1,Ishtar,"This movie is worse much worse than Ishtar. I am ashamed I watched this movie. The irony of this movie possibly being a psych experiment and the movie's actress' experiment in the movie has not been lost upon me. This is a horrible, horrible movie. wow..."
2,Surprisingly Miserable,"I've never written a review on Amazon before. I can't say much about this film other than for what should be a knockout comedic cast, it is amazingly boring and slow. I think the director imagined the humor would be found in the characters' quirky, offbeat dialogue, except the dialogue isn't funny or quirky. It's like watching the life of two semi-funny people, minus any interesting parts. I want my 3.99 back."
2,dragged on,This movie was not that great. I was excited and disapointed. It was just really slow . They could have cut out about an hour of it.
3,3 years too long,Had some funny parts but then the middle went off in a weird direction and went on too long. That took away from the beginning humor of the movie.
3,Good but to long,It was worth watching but there was a point when I wanted it to be over already!I like both main actors and that is why I chose this movie. I understand it had to be a bit longer because of the 5 year thing but still to long.
2,Disappointing,The title on the video should be a clue... disappointing. The movie is overly drawn out. I couldn't wait for it to finally get to a good ending.
2,dissapointing,"It looked funny from the commercials, but wasn't really that funny. And a little depressing. i expected more from this movie that i got. a little boring too."
3,"good quality instant, movie plot dragged","The quality for instant was good. The movie, even though it had some of my fave actors, Jason from HIMYM, Emily from The Queen, etc, the movie dragged"
3,Not the Best Rom-Com,"My BIGGEST complaint with this movie?? The make up was horrible. I kept looking at the faces/lips and thinking something was off with my TV. Really bad--and if you notice the make up you know you're not really interested in the movie as a whole. My favorite character was played by Mimi Kennedy who shined in her small role. Very uneven and rambling in places. It's an Ok ""stay in and watch something"" movie but I wouldn't buy the DVD."
2,Just OK,"This was an ""ok"" movie in my opinion. It basically shows the best scenes in the preview. It drags out and the ending is pretty obvious. But, it's good for a low key night as long as the expectations are low. That's my two cents!"
1,not funny,"I rented this movie because I was in need of a laugh, but was very disappointed, the movie wasn't funny at all. :-("
2,A slow five years,"This is the story of the trials and tribulations of a couple consisting of an American and an English woman. He is living his dream job and is about to be promoted, but he gives it all up when his fiance gets a job in cold Minnesota. He follows her as she follows her dream. So that pushes back the wedding. They have lots of good reasons for postponing their wedding, everything from moving, to injury and even a breakup. This is a painfully long, slow and dull movie. It has witty moments, but nothing that feels laugh out loud funny moments. More like amusing. The two main characters are to normal and or bland to be all that captivating for a romantic comedy that is longer than 2 hours. Thankfully they have a cast of quirky fun characters that make them look even blander.Please pass on this movie, you feel every minute of the 2+ hours."
5,Great season!!!!,"So many great ones on this season, my favorite is when President Bush moves next door to the Simpsons. I don't get why people don't like that one. That's one of my favorites in the history of the Simpsons."
3,Nice,This product started off nice. My two dogs sleep in the bed with me and the spread ended up with the whole top looking like it was full of fuzz balls or something. Washes well but not so nice anymore.
3,$14.99 for one jacquard pillow sham,This set is cheaper than buying an individual sham. I need one sham to recover my vanity stool so I am very pleased with this deeply discounted price. This is definitely more beige than ivory in color.
5,"Concise, exact, efficient, and to the point.","""What about gods"", was the first childrens book I have come upon that really reveals religion for what it is. Children that I have had the pleasure to expose this work to, immediately knew the truth. The term, ""lying to your mind"" is a qoute that I use now, even as an adult. About time someone wrote a work that children could in no way misinterpret. It's about time."
5,Priceless,"I wish there were more books like this. ""What About Gods"" really walks children through a simplified version of what gods are and why people believe in them. This books needs to be read under adult guidance for children under nine or ten (maybe older), because it is still a complicated subject matter.""What About Gods"" really walks a parent through the difficult task of explaining religion to kids, and gives kids the confidence to know that there is no reason for them to conform to a religious society."
2,I have mixed feelings about this book...,"My 9 year old was disappointed in this book. He already expressed agnostic leanings, and I thought this book would help clarify the issues. The thesis of this book is that the Judeo-Christian God is part of a mythological tradition and people believe in God for nonrational reasons. My son was disappointed that the book did not effectively explain why really smart people believe in God. The problem with the book is that it does not present alternate conceptions of God (besides the old man in the sky conception), so the book is an example of the straw man fallacy. Another problem with the book is that it assumes a very simplistic view of belief and knowledge. The book raises the right issues, but it is too superficial even for children. I would recommend it only if presented with another book that scratches the surface more deeply."
5,If you want your child to have an open mind.,"Nevertheless, your child might decide on a certain path, one taken by her friends, etc. In the long run, it is good to give them this exposure at an early age. Personally, I can't imagine imparting to my children that one or more of our neighbors (their trusted friends) has the wrong idea about religon. After all, for immediate neighbors we have: Hindi, Lutheran, Muslim, Catholic, Protestant, Buddist, and Morman to name a few. One of my daughters believes this book is inherently evil, while the other rejoices in the idea that we all have common needs. Judge it for yourself -- it is not confrontational."
2,A bit too cynical,"As an atheist, I completely agree with everything in this book. However, I'm uncomfortable with the harsh way these ideas are presented for children (as if those who hold a belief are bad and that the non-believers are the only clear thinkers). I felt as if I was being sternly lectured on the subject, even though I already agree. I have a 5 year old who has a lot of questions about religion and God and I'm trying not to push my view on her even though we do talk about why I don't believe in God. Anyway, I thought this might be something we could read together and then talk about the different beliefs and reasons people believe, etc. but I think this book is a little too heavy handed, so I'll be shelving it for a while. Bummer."
2,A bit antagonistic,"I chose not to let my children read this. The book is very down on any kind of belief in the supernatural (soul, spirit, etc) and seems to encourage belittling those that believe in anything unseen.I had hoped this was a book describing peoples' various views on god(s) and perhaps a brief overview of the development of religious belief. I was disappointed."
1,This book states that God does not exist.,"I was surprised to discover that this book opens with the idea ""Mythical characters, that's what gods are. They're not real. People made them up, you can unmake them just by thinking about it - this book can help you.""It would have helped me to know this before I ordered.That said, the book is not very good at what it sets out to do. Rather than present the athiest position in a way that is compelling, it simply makes bold anti-god statements, such as:""People who believe in one special god often don't like the other people to believe in a different god.""As a book about athiesm the author has not done a very good job."
3,"A Good, Slightly sad and strange, Book","I read this book for school. Some of the stories were highly interesting, but some of them were really sad. In one of them, a boy finds a kitten and in the end, it dies. Overall, it's worth checking out at the library, but not actually buying. The authors are all wonderful. If you can handle sadness and/or strangeness, this is the book for you."
4,The Tokyo Quartet is a Machine . . .,". . . but WHAT a machine! Some listeners may find this set less emotionally engaging than others. Personally, my favorite set is the Quartetto Italiano's on Philips, which keeps me from giving this set five stars: the QI plays with more sympathy and feeling, I think, than Tokyo. And any number of comparisons are possible. But if perfection is what you are looking for (and some days, we want polish more than we want elusive emotional qualities) this is perhaps the recording of the late quartets you will want. Tokyo's precision is sometimes breathtaking, and nowhere more so than in the opening of the Grosse Fuge (here played in its original position, as the final movement of the Quartett Op 130; don't worry, the later ending is there also)."
2,Not that great,"Chaise chairs in general are way overpriced. This chair is more reasonably priced, but the $100 shipping charge is excessive. The chair is pretty hard for a sofa-type chair and not especially comfortable. It is also very narrow. I purchased the dark brown color, but the actual color is quite a bit lighter than the picture shows. The storage space is very shallow and the seat cushion opens from the arm rest side of the chair which makes it awkward to access the storage area."
4,Great value,"This is a great product for the price. I was a little hesitant to order furniture over the internet, but could not beat the price so I took the risk. The chaise was delivered within a week of ordering and looked exactly as pictured. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because the seat could be a little more plush."
5,Great,Absolutely a great buy and was very surprised when this Chaise arrived!These guys are the best
2,Invest is something better,"I bought this as a gift for my wife for her birthday. I read the other reviews and thought I'd give it a shot because of the price. While the construction seems okay for the price, the chaise is smaller than I thought and not very comfortable. I would be very displeased if I bought this at the retail price of $600. Luckily I got it for half that price. It's a good thing my wife is short (5'1) because she just barely is able to lie on it. The microfiber is very rough and not what typical microfiber feels like. On top of all of that the shipping was a hassle because the item did not ship on the date the seller's email stated and the UPS tracking info was off a few days because of it. In the future I will only by furniture I can see in person."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I gave it one star only becaues no stars isn't an option. It's a total piece of crap: poorly designed, poorly made. It leaked oil all over. I had to drain the oil reservior after each use. Keeping the chain tight was impossible. After cutting for about 1 minute, the chain would be so loose I had to stop and fiddle with the thing for 5 minutes. Remington took a chain saw chain and bar, stuck them on some pieces of plastic with an electric motor and called it a chainsaw. I don't usually return items, but I'll make an exception for this POS because it simply doesn't function. [...]BTW- to the other reviewer: yes I did read the directions, actually. I read and followed them- it didn't help. Since I first posted this review I've purchased a Husqvarna electric saw and it works great- no issues. Lucia: are you a real person or a Remington rep?"
1,Don't buy it ! II,"I wish I had read Dana's review before buying this. I can live with the oil problem, but the chain comes off its drive sprocket after just a minute of sawing braches that have any vibration. To get it back is a production. The tension screw is used to get the ""adjustment block"" into the ""adjusting hole."" Well, you can't see either one, and indeed oil is leaking on you as you work on this. Five minutes later, you are ready for your next cut..."
5,Gimme a break,"... I received this set and it's gorgeous, and in the colors stated in the description. Perhaps the other customer should have called Amazon and let them know that they received the wrong dish set. Mystic is only offered in this color palette."
3,color is mis-represented on the site,"I thought this would be a purple-ish grey but it is really purple. The handles on the mugs are a little fragile, I broke one off by mis-handling it in the sink full of dishes. Other than that the pfaltzgraff co. has an impeccable product."
4,Much ado about nothing,"I was in need of a cooking time sheet for cooking and this read like the thing to get. I read the description but alass not the reviews. It is designed for someone new and in charge of a kitchen where raw items are stored in the fridge or freezer. It gives a conservative estimate on how long to store items safely. If you are new to cooking, it would be OK, but to someone with a few years under their belt it is a useless trinket fir only as a fridge magnet to hold the Grandbaby's lastest masterpiece."
3,"Great songs and recording, but....","For Duke Ellington collectors, well, you have to have this record. Some people may even wish to give it five stars. But I have one big problem with Ellington from this era, and that problem is Paul Gonsalves. It is an unfortunate quirk of jazz history that Gonsalves' solo at Newport revived Duke's career. Apparently, Duke felt he owed Paul big time, because Gonsalves is featured an inordinate amount in Duke's material from this era. The reason that is a problem, is that Gonsalves was just not a very good tenor sax player, or frontman. His solos never go anywhere, and they never feel like they are a part of the music. Gonsalves is always kind of out front on his own. Gonsalves never came close to Johnny Hodges, and the latter sax player should always have been featured during sax parts. If you are a Gonsalves fan, this record will be at the top of your list. But for me, Gonsalves brings the whole thing down to a 3-star rating."
2,Hi,"I am a sensative man and bought this book to understand her and her needs and that football, beer, and video games are all for little boys and I need to grow up.I hope all men that buy this book find it useful.I used it as a doorstop to help her move out of my house."
5,Perfect replacement part,This was a perfect fit for the original WeedEater part that had cracked and broken apart thru use and age.
2,Watch a video tape,"Maybe because I went and read the third novelisation first I messed up, but I found the writing to be OK at its best and brutal at its worst.Twice in only a couple of pages the following type of passage popped up:You are weird, thought Pembleton. ""You are weird,"" Pembleton said to Bayliss.If he went and said it, why waste time writing that he thought it first?Also, dialects and street slang are much more effective on screen than on paper.The plot was interesting and would make a pretty good 1-hour show. But when I'm reading I want something more involved than a 1-hour show, otherwise I'd have plunked myself in front of a television."
4,A fast read that will appeal to Homicide fans.,White Butterflies is the third novel in the Homicide set. It's a fast read and above average for a serialization of a television show. If you're a Homicide fan it gives you a chance to spend a little more time with the Baltimore detectives.
3,Nice product,"I have purchased it for 1996 Infinity I30. This regulator came in time and the price was way below all online autoparts stories offers. But I did some modification to it (drilled 2 extra holes) to match holes in a door body. It works smooth and you cannot say it is not original part. Will recomend it, but be aware (not afraid) of modification."
2,Way too hard to clean,"Muffins stick too much, and these are so hard to get clean I no longer use them. Not very useful."
1,Bad,These are Terrible! Try getting the muffins/cupcakes out of these in one piece:) ROFL You need to laugh about it!
1,These are NOT three inches in diameter,"Do not buy these cups if you want silicone cups that are three inches in diameter. These are a bare 2 and 1/2 inches in diameter. They are not as advertised. I had a hassle with amazon about this. I have to pay for return shipping, which I think is unfair, as they are clearly NOT AS ADVERTISED."
2,Silicone baking cups,I was not happy with my order. The description for the product said 3 inch baking cup. I received a 2 inch baking cup. I like the silicone but for my purpose I need the 3 inch cup.
3,Not what I expected,"I thought these cups would be a great way to save the hassle of buying paper liners and using a muffin pan. I liked that I can just wash and reuse them, and they are solid enough to just stand alone on a baking sheet in the oven without a muffin pan. however, getting cupcakes out of them is very difficult. They were pretty good for muffins, but with something a little more delicate like a cupcake I wouldn't recommend using these. I tried taking the cupcakes out right away and tried getting them out after cooling them. either way it was pretty difficult and I ended up damaging most of them and salvaging only a few of the batch! Also, I don't recommend serving your pastries in them because you have to constantly remind people not to throw away the cups! All in all, they seem like a really smart idea, but weren't what I expected. I'll probably go back to using paper liners and maybe just use these if I have extra batter."
3,not worth the money,"it seems like a good idea to have reusable baking cups. it eliminates the need to buy the paper ones, plus you can use them without the actual pan. the problem is they are very hard to clean. the cupcake batter slightly sticks to the baking cup and it is very hard to get off. i put it in the dishwasher and the residue of the cupcakes was still there. i soaked them in soapy water and THEN washed them in the dishwasher. most of it went away at that point, but what a pain. i think i will go back to the paper ones."
4,Use in Muffin Magic machine,"The only reason those did not get 5 stars is due to their size, however they fit perfect in the muffin magic machine to prevent tough bottoms. They can also be used without a muffin pan, just place on a cookie sheet. They handwash in a breeze or come out fine from the dishwasher. This brand was the most cost effective on Amazon."
1,Gimmick,"Not in love with these items, Even with using spray- the muffins stick to the silicone and it is really difficult to clean these. I would rather use paper, as it is an additional item to clean and are very tedious. Over priced as well, I went to World Market and found 6 for 2.50 same silcone."
4,works well for muffin and cupcake,"I used them for a few times so far and it works fine for muffins and cupcakes. I didn't spray oil on them. I just fill the batter into the cups then bake. I put these cups on rectangle baking pan also tried metal muffin pan too, and both worked great. The batter I made was very healthy (very low sugar and oil, maybe 1/4 of the receipe usually calls for), and the muffins or cupcakes all came out neatly. I'm very happy with its nonstickiness.The cups do get stained (from blueberry) which doesn't bother me. There might be 1 or 2 very tiny crumbs hidden in the ribs of a cup, so I just soak them for a few minutes then rub it off with dish sponge. I also tried top-rack dishwasher but they're hard to place on rack, so I just hand wash them. Overall, I think they're easy to clean and very good replacement for paper cups."
1,too small,i wish these were bigger since then they would have a use. i can't use them so it's just another waste of money.
3,Silicon bakeware,"I own several of these types of muffin cups, from Wilson and others. The wilson ones are a little thin, so they tend to tear. On the other hand they work really well. I always spray mine with cooking spray and this helps keep the muffins or cupcakes from sticking to them once cool. I also turn them inside out to wash them and put them in the dishwasher, they come out just fine, you kind of have to tuck them between dishes so they stay in one place. All in all a good product, if you don't want muffin tins."
4,Good but use with care,"Pros:Easy to store, lightweight and stackableEasy to unmold, came off easily without any greasing the first 2 times I've used it. Reading the other comments I might grease it the next timne I use it though.No need to buy paper liners. You can serve the cupcakes in them or peel them off and serve.Cons:Have a tendency to retain the smell of soap so rinse thoroughly before use lest your cakes taste soapyThese cupcake molds are very thin so be careful while peeling them off. I was a little rash and tore one:(Not very dishwasher friendly. Better to wash them by handStill think they are a good buy since I always forget to get liners. I have also used the silicone bundt pan and found it great. If you want to see pictures and recipes I've used see [...]"
1,Not the size advertised,"These are NOT 3"" in diameter as advertised. More like a normal size muffin or cupcake, just a bit more than 2"""
3,Baking Cups,"I chose these over the muffin silicone pan, thinking they would be handier which they are as I can use just the amount I need. The muffins do tend to stick a little sometimes to the baking cups, which sometimes tears the muffins in half."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Good quality cups, though difficult to wash since they are far from nonstick--which is what I had expected from a silicone product."
3,"Terrible for muffins, awesome for ice cream and sorbet","Every complaint about baked goods sticking to these cups and ripping apart unless you douse them with lubricant first is 100% correct. I will never use these for baking again. These would have gotten one star from me if it wasn't for my frozen goodies discovery... These are the best homemade ice cream/sorbet serving containers ever made. Whip up a batch of ice cream, portion it out into the silicone cups, and pop them in the freezer. You can eat it right from the container without a spoon, or flip the cups inside-out to pop out a serving of a-la-mode for your pie. It even looks a little fancy with the crinkled edges..."
1,Fine if you want cup caps!,"I absolutely loved these before I used them. Colorful and cute, but then I used them. Half of the cupcakes stuck to the inside of the cup. A disapointment and messy. I then baked another set of cupcakes using the old paper liners, which worked just fine."
3,These are not as large as stated,"These may work well, but I wouldn't know because as soon, as I got them, I could see that they were too small. They are listed as being 3 inches. However, even across the top they are closer to 2.5 inches and the bottoms are only 2 inches. The smaller size is listed as 1 7/8 inches, so clearly they are capable of precise measurement."
2,Cake sticks and hard to wash,"I had really high hopes because I love silicon utensils. Unfortunately the cake sticks in the ridges of these baking cups. It's so hard to wash off, and even after scrubbing and scrubbing when they dried I'd find traces of cake. I thought it was unsanitary that I couldn't get them clean easily so I threw them away."
1,DIFFICULT to clean!!!!!,"I bought these silicone reusable baking/muffin cups thinking, wow, great for the environment since I won't have to use paper baking cups anymore. They bake fine, but keep in the mind the following MAJOR con -- they are a PAIN PAIN PAIN to clean! Especially the ridges/folds where the baked food gets into. Seriously, I was wasting all kinds of water and time, using scrubber, even toothpick and toothbrush to try to get these spaces clean! And yes, of course, I greased these cups prior to baking, I used the traditional butter and flour-dusting, as well as ""Pam"" type cooking sprays, and STILL the resultant mess. Don't waste your money! They work in theory, but NOT in practice! I will probably use these as jello molds, since jello is easier to wash of than cake batter."
4,Great for just regular bowls,"I would never recommend anything plastic for cooking or hot liquids or foods because you have to worry wheather the chemicals are leaching into the food. However, these are great for condiments and dips and things. They dont break and they clean easily. These would have gotten one star from me if it wasn't for my dips discovery These are the best homemade dips and salsas that you are serving informally. Whip up a batch of dip, portion it out into the silicone cups, and then just serve or freeze them. You can eat it right from the container without a spoon, or flip the cups inside-out to pop out a serving dip and chips. It even looks a little fancy with the crinkled edges I will never use these for baking but I like how they stack so nicely."
3,Overall a good product,They work great and I love that I can wash and reuse them. They are just a pain to get completely clean.
3,These are so pretty but...,"It bakes up nicely, even sitting on a cookie sheet..but when guests went to peel back the sides to get the cupcake out, the sides not peel back like cupcake paper would...it's stiff and hard to open, especially if there is frosting on the edges...kind of messy"
4,Pretty easy to work with,"I have wanted to try these for quite a while since I enjoy baking so much. I did find they are a little smaller than regular cupcake liners and you need to be careful to not overfill. If you overfill, they will overflow a bit and make a mess. It's nice to be able to bake more than a dozen at a time since more of these will fit on a cookie sheet to bake. I also discovered that if you try to remove cupcakes/muffins immediately, they do still stick a little. If you wait a few minutes to remove, they come out very easily. A little more difficult to clean than regular pans you can stick in the dishwasher, but I've discovered that any higher quality item is better for handwashing anyway. Overall, if you enjoy baking, I do recommend these."
2,I finally threw them out,"I really loved these or so I thought. I loved them before I started making cup cakes so much. They store easily, are lightweight, and fit so nicely in my cupboard. I started making all sorts of things in them cause they are perfect portions. I made cupcakes, muffins, meatloaf, quiche, and brownies. Luckily for me I don't have to wash the dishes in my house, because these were a pain to wash. They had to be hand washed, not because they require it but because the dish washer couldn't get into all the little grooves. They had to be soaked to moisten the baked on goodness, and then flipped inside out and scrubbed. The family finally revolted and refused to wash them any more.I tried to use a paper liner with them, but I didn't have much like. They had to move out. :("
3,The appeal of Silicone baking is lost on me,"Purchasing these baking cups definitely fall under the category of ""it sounded like a good idea at the time"". There are a lot of baking ideas that come with silicone backing cups...I just don't recommend using them for cupcakes or muffins.Cupcakes and muffins will bake in these...but no better than the traditional paper cups. Trying to get a cupcake out of it without completely destroying it is darn near impossible. I tried taking it out of the cup before icing too but the cupcakes really need the extra support in order to be iced well."
3,eyvind kang creation,"To be honest I havn't given this one enough of a listen, as I didn't realy get the urge to play it repeatedly. I don't want to put it down as I believe this guys creations are all musicaly exceptional, but unfortunately this album just didn't excite me as much as some other stuff I have heard! There is probably a whole heap of Eyvind Kang fans out there just cursing at me for this review !! don't let me put you off though, give it a listen. I know that I couldn't create anything even half as good as this album, I might be too critical from hearing too mutch great music....P.S. I have seen this guy play live and he left me praising his performance as I picked my jaw up off the ground!"
4,Like it for the bright and cheerful design.,"As with the Black Olives design, these are on thin card stock, and use up a little valuable line space for nutritional info. However, they are bright and cheerful, come in two sizes and have their own plastic sleeves. Oh yes, they are also lined on BOTH sides. Not too expensive for all that (if you don't have to factor in overpriced shipping charges!)"
2,This Book is OUT-OF-DATE!!!,"WHAT A FARCE!! We are actively in the market for a sailing catamaran to live-aboard while blue water cruising, and we attend every boat show possible. After reading positive reviews of THE CRUISING MULTIHULL by Chris White, we ordered it. Much to our chagrin, the original copyright date is 1990, and LATEST is 1997!! Anyone who keeps up with the changing designs and technology of cruising catamarans knows that any of these boats that are over 5 years old are as obsolete as a 486 computer!If all you want to learn about multihulls is the basic differences between them and monohulls, then the 2-stars we gave this review may make it worth about half the price.However, the information in this book is USELESS to anyone looking to buy a new or even recent model multihull. Hey Chris... either get up to date on the new boats & revise your book, or take this dinosaur off the market!"
4,a very good book,"highly recommend this book. Yes it is a bit dated. I cant remember what I paid, maybe 15 dollars new, and for that price was a very good book. The second hand price being asked now is pretty good, no way would I pay $93 (what happened there?)If you want to understand what makes a good large multihull then this is a great book. Not many books are out there on this subject (in fact way way to few). If you looking at buying a large multihull then this is a great book. Its getting on 17 years old now thus the information is dated, despite that its still a very good book as general knowledge, even more so because there are so few alternatives out there.It tends to be a generalist book, going over many subjects lightly, still a pretty good book though"
2,Not updated,"Although there is some helpful basic info about multihulls, this book was a big disappointment to me because it hasn't been updated. If you are looking for information about multihulls less than 10 yrs old this is not the book for you."
5,"True to its name, VS = Vivid Saturation!","This film is really fun to use. I've used it with outdoor/nature scenes, and the color is amazing. It is particularly dramatic if used with a warming filter. In my experience, one possible downside is that it also intensifies blues that occur with cloudy/snowy days."
1,FPGEE by Shroff is full of mistakes!,"I bought another book by M. Shroff the Foreign Pharmacy Graduate Equivalency Exam, and it is full of mistakes. I wrote an e-mail to the given address, but noone never answered. I called and left my number, noone called me back. What is more, I learned that this is the only book by Mr. Shroff that I cannot return. They are not even interested in the mistakes I found. I would never trust this author again, and please do not buy this book, you will be disappointed."
4,very nice book for naplex,I am very pleased with this book. This book gives you an idea about how Naplex exam should be handeled. All chapters are well organised and written in easily understandable language. The most important aspect of this book is that at the beginning of each chapter it has classification with brand and generic names of drugs. I will definately recommende this book to all pharmacy students.
2,review of cd single box set,"item was quite late and was missing two of the ep discs that go with the box set, condition was fair"
5,10 cd jewels,"i spent years looking for this set. i still remember when it was first released...i tried to find it then, but lost the chance due to the SMART cocteau fans getting there before me!every disc in this set is magical...liz's voice, angelic with hidden strength and power. the ehteral guitar work... i'm rambling....the music is unlike any other...the words produce emotion unlike any you've felt before...the mood will send you flying toward a place you've never been before.cocteau twins. 10 cd set. 1 chance. take it...nowpeace"
5,Worth collecting,"After spending a long time trying to find it, I found it at an independent music store here in Houston. There is a considerable amount of material here, most of it very hard to collect, unless perhaps you live in the U.K.My favorite CT song, ""From the Flagstones"", is here.If you live in Houston, Soundwaves on Westheimer near Alabama usually carries it."
2,"Average text, but not worth the money","The text does provide some useful Matlab scripts and a good introduction to mechanics of composites, but quite frankly it is not worth the $225 price that Amazon is asking for. If you are very new to Matlab, then the scripts are very helpful. However if you're a novice with some exposure, all of the given scripts could be created with relative ease. I was very disappointed with the section on failure theories. The Max Stress/Strain, Tsia-Hill and Tsai-Wu section was only 5 pages long. It looked much like a copy/paste of a Wikipedia page, only showing the fundamental equations and nothing more. There are no scripts provided for failure analysis either, which would have been more useful then the elementary scripts provided. It can be a useful text, but only if you can get a very cheap copy."
4,gotta dance,"The movie is great! Very inspirational for boomers and beyond. My only concern with product was that when I recieved it, there was no shrink wrap on it and the seal had been broken and case had a piece missing. I believed information said I was buying a new product, but prehaps not."
4,A good game for Dukes lovers,"I purchased this game for my son who is a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard. He loves being able to pretend that he is actually in the General Lee. I would recommend this game for kids and fans of the show/movie. It is not a challenging game by no means, but lots of fun."
4,dukes of hazard return of general lee,I bought the game as a x-mas gift for my daughter. She was very happy because she really loves the game. It came very fast and it was new and in the package like it said it would be. She plays it for hours.
4,Nice and reasonably priced,"As always, I read several reviews before buying this spoon rest. It's reasonably nice-looking, I am satisfied with the purchase."
3,"good idea, but too tall","Good idea for a spoon rest, but too tall for some silverware. ""C"" part on top of lean bar needs to be about 1"" lower. Also, mass manufactured, so not perfectly symmetric; a little sloppy. Recommend buying from a store so you can look at many of them and pick the best one."
3,A.........OK......CLASSIC FOR DA LATE 80'S,"I STILL HAVE THIS TAPE,PLUS THA WORDS ON THA TAPE,IS NO LONGER THERE!''"
4,A great west cost classic,Too bad this is only D.O.C great album...a glimpse of what might have been.
4,Good introductory book,"I breezed through the book in a few hours. The book gave me a good introduction to Jacob and his twelve sons. A good book for beginners on the subject. The author did a good job in remaining objective and relying on as much ""factual"" knowledge as possible.The price made this book an excellent bargain. You can't lose in purchasing this book."
3,Good as an Introductory Study,"This is a good book to use as an introductory study on the 12 tribes, it is written in an almost devotional style format. It shows what the Bible has to say about these tribes and what we can learn from them spiritually and how to apply such things to our lives. This book is not for the in-depth scholar."
2,annoying restart and awful visual interface,"You can't resize the console. The manual has a couple of mistakes. There is no ""Enable port scan detection check"". I think it's referring to ""Detect port scanning activity"". I was tricked by a marketing ploy to buy it to my regret. What a waste -Tom"
2,'Elementary' Functions - Not!,"I have the first 1968 publication which was used in a JC 'College Algebra' class. I found this book overly presumptuous. Yes, it is tauted as a Pre-Calculus text but to me you better have some Calculus background first. In fact, a Business Calculus class prerequisite would be advised.Why create and teach from a book for 'foundations' of Calculus, with f(x) assumptive references, when the student has no idea what Calculus is? This book is a dry collection of functions that are used in Calculus - period. I took Calculus later on and did fine and still dabble in Abstract Algebra and Classical Complex Analysis. I would offer that if you are going to begin to learn Calculus, use the functions needed as you go; otherwise, what's the point?"
4,school stuff,This was a great product for my 5th grader that has trouble with spelling. The kids are even allowed to use them in class to help them with paper writting.
1,Piece of junk,"Did not open until my granddaughter's birthday. New batteries. Am experienced computer, device user. Not a chance that we misread instructions or lacked skill. Worked for 5 minutes and then started getting garbage. Reset as well as the logical turn it off and on and the usual problem solving. Device simply is poorly made. Someone thought that a flashy case would do it. Don't waste your money. Return policy plus cost makes it nonsense to return and I certainly don't want a replacement."
2,Franklin homework Wiz children's,Should've purchase a higher end model.. this model is too slow and with limited vocabulary.
1,Poor quality look for an older model!!,"I recently recieved two of these for my girls age 6 and 8. They are poorly made the lid is very flimsy and the buttons stick when the child is typing. Also, the silly cartoons that pop up are distracting to the child....I have one that is at least 15 years old that still works beautifully these are a waste of money."
3,"Great, while it lasted","I liked this dictionary. It was the right size (not too big to be heavy, not too small so that my six-yr-old would lose it.) It kept my daughter from asking me a million questions about what words meant, because I could just direct her to her special dictionary. The buttons were big enough for little hands, and the design (the way it looks) appeals to children. We used this dictionary every day for about a week, when I accidentally dropped it (from about waist level, and I'm only five feet) and it stopped working. Granted, Franklin didn't make any claims for indestructibility, but seeing that it's something made for children that will be tossed around, dropped, thrown in a book bag or a desk-should be a tad sturdier than it is."
5,Granddaughter loved it,"I purschased this product for my 8 yr old granddaughter. She loves all the features, spelling, games, add your own list of words, etc. I feel this product will be a big help to her for fun and for school.Franklin HW-1216 Children's Speller and DictionaryI would recommend this product."
4,Good value,My kids (5-10) use this frequently when they are not sure how to spell a word (you type in how you think it is spelled and if your wrong it will give you the correct spelling) They also like the tic tac toe. The only problem we have is some words are not there. My daughter was studying for the 5th grade spelling bee and I would say about 1/3 of the words she was studying could not be found in the dictionary. I am coming on now to find a more advanced dictionary. For the price this is a great value.
2,Very disapointing,"I bought this dictionary for my 3rd grade daughter to help her on spelling. The excitement was gone in 30 minutes after not being able to find more than 3 words in 10 searches. Many easy words can't be found, and most of word descriptions are so simple that she still can't really understand the full meaning of the words.The calculator feature in the dictionary is pretty much useless.She likes to play Hangman with me, but we always have to add the word to the word list, and ask Hangman to get the word from the list.There is also a game called fun with Spanish and French..it was interesting to look the sentences in Spanish & French once, and that is about it.The screen resolutoin is very low, so the letters are quite jaggy.I am very disappointed with this particular dictionary. Maybe I should try the other more expensive models."
2,Works OK,"We use this product to put a long bend on a roof panel that has been cut down in width. You need to exert a lot of pressure against the metal on the first pass so that the edge roller does not arc off of the bend line. Once the crease has been put in the metal, it is almost impossible to correct the bend if it is not where you want it. On the other hand, it beats using a hand seamer to bend the edges. Most of the bends that this is used on are too long to fit in a break. Not the easist product to use, but beats most of the alternatives, just takes a lot of work."
2,Negative!,"I bought this tool 2-3 years ago, unsure of whether I really needed a chainsaw long term. As I have trees on my lot and feed a woodstove, I have found the tool indespensible. However, I am not at all happy with Remington's version of a chainsaw. The positive, and the negative, is simply: this tool is cheap. I liked the fact that it is quiet and emits no pollution at the point of use. The power was always acceptable. The problem comes at the point when you (inevitably) need to adjust the tension in the chain. The tensioner is worthy of a matchbox car, not a power tool. The adjuster travels a plastic track, based on your turning of a thumbscrew. The mechanism bent at first stress, and works no more. Too bad, as the motor and chain are still as good as ever. As they say, the bitterness of low quality lasts longer than the sweetness of a low price. This function could have been more robust. The tool is worth less without it. Spend the extra money to get a real tool."
1,Junk,"Bought the Remington Model 107625 about 6 months ago after a long term electric saw quit (at least ten years old and heavily used). Used this saw once for trimming up some small branches. Used it on a larger piece, making sure it was full of oil (the oil will leak out when it's being stored), and shutting it off every few minutes to keep the electric motor cool. Had to adjust the blade twice. After setting it aside for about fifteen minutes, I found it wouldn't turn on. No problem with electric service, it's the chainsaw. Having it repaired (if parts are even available) would cost more than the price of the chainsaw. It's Junk."
2,Pay extra and get a better Chainsaw,"I purchased this chainsaw at a nationally known hardware store and paid more than the price here at Amazon. My problem with this chainsaw began after only a couple times of light use when I cut a few tree branches around my home. The tightening screw for the chain was the first thing to go and became bent and never worked well again. I see in other reviews this is a common problem with this unit. After that the chain started repeatedly falling off as I tried to cut through normal size branches 4 inches to 10 inches. It took more and more time to retighten and adjust the chain, until I just expected it to fall off during each cut. I considered getting a new chain for the saw but decided the problem with this chainsaw is more than just the chain. I recently purchased a new WORX chainsaw and highly recommend it for light use. Sometimes a little extra money goes a long way in the quality and reliability."
1,Junk,Bought this for one small tree from storm damage and the motor burnt up before I finished. Terrible product for sure!
2,"Worked OK, for a while...","I've had this saw for a few years and have used it a several times a year and it worked pretty well. However, when I used it this year to cut some dead wood it started to give off smoke and a bad electrical odor. After this happened some power was lost and it got really hot. I let it cool down and it still runs at half power. The motor must be shot. I'm going to buy a better quality saw from now on."
2,Too big and heavy.,"Honestly, I have never used it. I ordered it, and when it came, just the weight of it was morethan I could handle. I'm sure some strong person could handle it just fine, but I went back tomy chain saw."
3,Liquid Leather Pro and Vinyl Repair Kit,"It worked with a little effort. However, I still had to take the seat to an upholstery shop for repair as the tear was on a seam making it more difficult for this product to do the job."
1,Overrated,the glue on this product does not withstand any pressure and although it claims to shrink and pull leather together it does not. The color kit does not offer the shine that leather has and I have not yet found a way to retore shine to the repaired section of my leather.
2,Don't wast youur money,"I tried the product and found it very hard to complete any repair without it looking terrible. Yes, it did cover the hole but not sure it was worth it. I finally looked on-line and found there are actually companies out there that specialize in leather repair, and boy can they make that tear goo away! You are much better off if you do your research and find someone to do it right the first time."
1,Don't waste your time or money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the repair kit is extremly difficult to use and causes more damage than repair. the cost is inexpensive but it's still not worth your time or money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,It Works... Sort of.,"I used this to patch a very small tear in a vinyl convertible top. I used an iron on patch on the inside and this on the exterior. The color changes dramatically from how it looks in the mixing cup to once it is cured. It's more rubbery then vinyl. The texture paper doesn't really work. I ended up with more of a flat circle. All of that being said, it does work in the sense of patching the hole. That's the only reason it get's two stars from me. In the future I don't think I would waste my time. I'll just buy an iron on patch for the inside and some 100% silicone. Also what I received was not retail packaging. Not sure that makes a difference, but thought I'd throw that out there."
1,don't buy this,"This is one of the worst products I have ever seen!!!! After a lot of mixing I Got the color right but when it dried it was a darker color. The texture looked like a glob of paint on the seat. Tried to remove the mess and ruined the seat. The texture sheets are a joke. The ""repair"" looked much worse then before I started. Duck tape would have been a better fix. Don't waste your money."
1,Not good for large area,"I bought this hoping it will fix the large damage on my sofa arm. But, it does not seem to be good for anything beyond a small area - nothing more than the size of penny."
1,horrible.,this product made the little tear in my heels look a million times worse. it does not work at all how it's advertised to work.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I tried to use this on my couch cushion, and like other users I found it near impossible to match the color (beige) of my couch. I followed the directions very carefully and tried my hardest, but in the end I just ended up with a different colored rip that didn't stay together. Oh well! For the price, it was worth a try, but I really wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Don't waste your money or your effort."
1,very hard to match a color,"You have to be an artist to match the color correctly. Even if you get it to match when the mix is wet, the color changes somewhat when it dries. Looked better with the small whole than it does now."
2,not a lasting fix,"hard to match color, then very hard to get it hot enough. an ok fix for a limit time but doesn't last long before the patch area begins to crumble."
1,Does Not Work. Don't buy it.,"I purchased this product eventhough the reviews were terrible, therefore I deserve having wasted my money. I purchased it because one review stated that the product worked and you just needed to be a crafty person. That's me, very crafty, mechanically enclined, can do almost anything, starting from a needle to a skill saw. However, this product does not work at all. I followed the instructions to the T, tried it several times because I thought I was doing something wrong. Nope. Don't waste your money it does not work."
1,"""repair"" should be used loosly",This product didn't work at all. Followed the instructions to a T. Could not get the leather repair to cure. Don't purchase this product. I threw it out.
3,it's okay,"product is okay, you have to make sure you mix the right color. It does the job (it covered the holes in the leather), but you can see the difference."
1,misleading,If you read the description you would expect a electric tool to come with. But nope not gonna happen just a wood dowel stuck to a piece of metal they expect you to heat somehow. No nice box like in the picture either.
3,noticeable,"I paint as a hobby so mixing colors is easy for me so I felt I did a good job getting a match in color however the tear I had was in a leather cocktail ottoman adjacent to a seam, I figured that it would be noticeable but personally felt it was pretty bad. The edges flaked off and it is slightly raised so my son picks at it. It doesn't look like leather but rather a spot of melted plastic. I will have to do again soon (luckily the kit provided enough to do several small areas). It is sufficient for me as I have an almost 2 year old and just wanted to stop the tear from getting worse ( and from finding the inside padding all over the place) until we find a new ottoman but it is noticeable so if your tear, rip, puncture is in a noticeable spot consider an alternative."
4,Pro Leather Repair Kit,"It has all the things you need to repair leather furniture, It worked great and the final results exceeded my expectations."
1,Ruined my chair even more,"The kit was difficult to use. Complicated and messy. In the end, my chair looked worse than it did with the tear I was trying to fix."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This item does not work at all. There is no way you can match the color. and the heating system is a piece of metal that is suppose to get hot but it does not. please save your money or buy a cover for you couch!
3,Difficult,"It was difficult to work with, limited instructions and the end result wasn't necessarily eye worthy!"
1,I was sent a partial kit...,"The Liquid Leathers Leather & Vinyl Repair Kit was not complete. The glue was missing, paint colors were missing. It didn't even come in the box that it was shown with. Almost like someone used it and decided to sell it again. Hard for me to give it even one star."
3,I Ordered The Wrong Product!,"I was looking for a NO HEAT leather repair and clicked on the wrong one, that was my mistake. The company shipped very quickly and was not their fault so I didn't send it back as the return postage would have been about the same price I paid for the item. I have no use for this one as I already have one exactly like it and it was hard to use and didn't do a good job."
1,This product does not work on leather sofa,"This product does not work on leather sofa. The glue would not cure properly even with heating iron and hair dryer. When the material dry, its will flake off after a couple of days...This is the worse product I have tried..."
1,Terrible,"Following the instructions carefully, I did not achieve satisfactory results. The end results were either sticky or flaky with no in-between. I ended up throwing the kit out."
3,not bad,"i was able to achieve a successful repair. however, i will not recommend this product to someone who has no knowledge of color mixing. lucky for me, i have knowledge on color mixing. do to the design of my sofa, it was harder to work with the texture paper on corner holes. you may have to reapply compound and heat."
2,Not what I expected,"The product description is intriguing but when you see the cheap, camcorder-quality video and the dated 80s-era men it puts you right off the video. None of the Guys Next Door videos had reviews from which to judge previous customers' experience and I knew I would be taking a chance purchasing them without a review or previewing them prior to purchase."
3,More Please.,"A good book and a good buy, but I think the author could have added more material. I loved the photos and illustrations and prints, but there should have been more material on the President and United States. Let's face it, there is plenty of material out there on the Constitution, which is great, but next to nothing on its aforementioned sister ships. The author missed an opportunity to fill that gap.As a modeler, I appreciated what was given, but what I really wanted was more info on the two other ships and some honest to goodness info on the paint colors and personal touches the Captains used to personalize their ships (i.e., color of bulwarks, appearance of the Captain's Gallery, etc.) I was hoping for reference material, instead I got the Reader's Digest version."
3,Don't take the wrong path!,"I like this version of Little Red Riding Hood because no one gets killed in the end. This book takes place in the woods. Little Red Riding Hood was walking to her grandma's house and decided to take a different path. When she got to grandma's house, there was the wolf wearing grandma's night gown which had sheep print on it. The wolf locked grandma away in the closet in hopes of saving her for a late night snack. Luckily the wolf didn't eat or hurt anyone, he accidentely fell out of a window, tumbled down a hill and ran away. Afterwards Little Red unlocked the closet door and let grandmother out. They later had a picnic and lived happily ever after."
5,Fun Book!,Love this as a companion to the LRR Hood Lilliputians Fairytale Cloth Doll. They will be a sweet present for my great-niece.
4,Don't take the wrong path by Tamera Wright,"I like this version of Little Red Riding Hood because no one gets killed in the end. This book takes place in the woods.

2,Could you go any safer? Doubtful.,"What kind of rule is it that every supergroup, regardless of how innovative their original bands are, has to put out the most unoriginal schlock imaginable?Following in the proud, safe tradition of chart toppers by Audioslave and Velvet Revolver, I present to you the Panic Channel. (ONe) sounds like the birthchild of the filler songs by both previously mentioned bands. Listening to this disc leaves no doubt in your mind as to who the musical mind was in Jane's Addiction.Among the many, many problems the album has, perhaps the worst is lead vocalist Steve Isaacs. Isaacs, a former MTV VJ, has the vocal intensity of Chad Kroeger's less talented brother. Seeing as how Dave Navarro is a host for the CBS prime time show Rock Star, it's perhaps only fitting that the singer chosen for this band sounds like he came off a reality show.""Win a chance to front Jane's Addiction, only without the heart, soul, or innovation!""What a waste of talent."
3,good but.......,"ok, there is musicianship in this album no question about it, but it just sounds like a middle aged men rock band(i know they're all in their late 30's so probably they're middle aged) ......it's very predictible........good musicians......not so creative music. Hopefully the next album will be better than this one.P.S. I own every single full lenght release by Dave Navarro or Stephen Perkins(banyan, deconstruction, jane's addiction, RHCP's one hot minute, trust no one)that i've been able to get my hands on, so this is a no hate involved type of comment, i'm just a fan being as honest as possible....."
3,Do you remember Talkshow????,"Talkshow was Stone Temple Pilots with a generic singer/lyricist as the front man. The band was just to good for the singer and the album suffered.The same can be said of The Panic Channel. The music is spot on but the vocals and lyrics sometimes literally make you cringe. They should have found a better singer because he is overshadowed by the band.Next up, maybe Dave will finally do the long awaited Spread album."
2,This was panically released.,After hearing about 6 tracks off of the CD I believe they need to recall it and add some power to it in the studio. I hope this band has some big names to follow it on tour or I forsee alot of cancelled tours due to poor ticket sales. After a few one hit wonders on other named albums by these band members I would of thought they wouldn't release something so mediocre.
2,Wheres the hits?,"I listened to this whole CD in my car on the way to work, and gave it a second chance on the way home. The second time I found myself advancing the tracks because the music was just nothing and boring. I was waiting for a big hit like NIN or Korn. No hits on this one, this is a stinker and goes into my bad drawer pile of CD's. I think that guy that is hosting the TV show seemed to be getting some hypes about this CD and that is why I bought it in the first place, his playing is really in the background and nothing special, the songs are run of the mill garage band stuff. If you can't keep up with the big boys, get out of the fire."
1,Very Generic Sounding Music,"As a hardcore Jane's Addiction fan that loved them for their edge and pioneering sounds, this album is a major let down.Where he at one time was a rock guitar innovator, Dave Navarro seems content now reproduce cliche riffs in an effort to sound more radio friendly.Stephen Perkins no longer brings the funk with his tribal drumming, and instead simply keeps the beat in a more digestable manner.Chris Chaney has always been a hired gun as a bass player and he certainly sounds the part. Nothing exciting.Steve Isaacs is vocally as generic as they come. He can sing, but his voice leaves no lasting imprint. Very oridinary. And his lyrics...my god. I've read diary entries by a depressed 14 year old girl more compelling than this tripe.Save your money.Perry Farrell's releasing a new album soon."
3,Where have all the good bands gone?,"Considering that members of this band have been in Porno For Pyros, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Infectious Grooves, and 3/4 of these guys were in Jane's Addiction, I expected more. The strange thing is that they all sound good, Navarro and Perkins bring it as one would hope, and Steve Isaacs is a decent singer I guess, but as a whole it just sounds kind of generic, like others have stated. On the plus side ""(One)"" is still a fine listen, it's just not that exciting. Similar to the ""Strays"" album in that way. At the moment I'd call the best songs ""Teahouse Of The Spirits"", ""She Won't Last"", and ""Blue Bruises"". Overall, I'm tempted to say that if the next album doesn't exceed this one, it might be time for Navarro and Perkins to ""panic"" and ""channel"" the earlier days of their former band. Hey, at least I got a free T-shirt."
1,no vision,"I don't like it. The Lyrics are weak, the music is predictable and generic, They have a very dull lead singer trying to replace Perry Farrell the godfather of alternative rock."
3,No Gadd? No Good!,"Most of the prior reviews will give you a good idea of the quality of this DVD and the series in general, but being a drummer there was one glaring omission.No Gadd!Steve Gadd is one of the most influential drummers of the last 30 years. His solo on the track Aja is one of his most respected works. There is no mention of this or even OF HIM!! His name is never uttered! I am appalled. There has got to be a political reason for this as there is no way this was just an oversight.For me, this was a huge blow as I looked forward to getting some insights on one of the most important drum recordings I can think of."
3,Not a concert DVD !,"This is a documentary, but still very good, and contains a lot of partial songs. If you like Steely Dan ,this is for you !"
1,Steely Dan Aja DVD,I've just purchased this DVD and felt that it was a total waste of my money to purchase it and a total waste of my time to watch. I found it disjointed and lacking in direction. It seemed to me to be a typical Fagen/Becker self absorbed kind of rambling. I have loved this album since it's release in 1977. I have loved Steely Dan's music since they were a band. To pay almost no attention to the song Aja and to the incredible drumming of Steve Gadd on the track was a huge disappointment to me. I am not any richer in my knowledge of this AWESOME piece of work having spent my limited free time watching it. I consider Aja to be The Dan's Magnum Opus and would have really preferred to have more information about the inspiration for the music instead of the technical studio jargon Fagen/Becker employ. I had such a sense of anticipation and excitement based on the reviews I've read here on Amazon. What a let down!gypsy
1,Mostly Chatter,"I wrongly expected that this DVD would be mainly music along with some background. What happens is that they will begin to play a song, and then one of the players will start talking about who-knows-what about how they played the track. It is interesting for a while, but anyone wanting to hear music should pass on this one. A one-time viewing experience."
5,A cool inside look at the people and the process behind Aja,"If you are a Steely Dan fan, you have to buy this. The insights into how the pair work in the studio, hearing Fagen play back and discuss discarded guitar solos for Peg, hearing the musicians talk about the studio work - it is all fascinating. My 8 year old son is a fan and he wanted to see it over again almost immediately. So did I!"
5,a peek behind the curtain reveals the Wizards of DAN!,"Virtually all the DVDs in this series are fascinating and this title is no exception. If you are a musician as well as a fan then this will be doubly interesting as the reclusive Becker and Fagen break down the classic songs from this legendary album. From the idiosyncratic drumming of Jim Keltner..on one track to Rick Marotta on another..to Dean Parks guitar, Chuck Raineys Bass, and even Michael McDonald discussing the frighteningly detailed nuance messers Fagen and Becker required of his background vocals..a picture develops of this unique hybrid that is Steely Dan. Like the other great titles in this series it is wonderful to have classic titles like this disected by the creators of the music and the players rather than hack journalists...and it is amazing to see how ALL the participants so vividly recall the events some two decades later! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.."
5,An education in the making,"This is a marvellous DVD on the making of Steely Dans great album Aja. All of Walter Becker and Donald Fagans legendary perfectionism is on display.Fortunately for us all the tapes of their sessions were saved, so we are able to hear some of the fabulous guitar solos they rejected for Peg; but then when you re-hear the original you understand why. There are interviews with many guest musicians: Jazz Tenor great Wayne Shorter.Drummer Bernard Purdie who demonstrates his uniquely funky drumming style.Michael McDonald talks about some the fiendishly difficult backing vocals he multi-tracked with himself.This is an essential purchase for the Dan fan or for anybody generally interested in the music making process by two of the most fascinating musicians in the business."
4,Deconstructing the Dan,"This is a fascinating documentary about a fascinating band: Steely Dan. A must for Dan fans, this DVD takes apart the dense arrangements of the Dan classic recording Aja. I love the music, and finding out about all the subtle nuances and surprises buried in the arrangements was very interesting. Also included are interviews with the musicians involved, not just Becker and Fagen. If you're a music theory or composition student, or a Steely Dan fan, I recommend this DVD."
3,No mention of Steve Gadd??? What?,"Good dvd if you're a Dan fan...but how in god's name do you not mention Sreve Gadd? Steve's work on the title tune ""Aja"" was pivitol to it's success. Not just another factory studio musician (no-disrespect) but where else in the recorded history of Steely Dan has a drum solo been applied? Does anybody out there know Becker or Fagan personally so they can explain this absurd omission?"
4,They Speak!,"Finally, we actually get to see Donald and Walter smile, laugh, even (dare I say?) make jokes. Albeit, it is ""highbrow"" humor (as one musician put it, when working with Donald and Walter... ""there are no fart jokes.""). In this video, we see a side to them that is not seen on the ""Two Against Nature"" video. And they seem to be having fun picking apart the songs from ""Aja"" on the sound board, track by track. Kids in a candy store. Very interesting, plus interviews with musicians who performed on the album. If there were videos for all of the Dan albums, I would own every one. But then, I'm obsessed!"
2,This is not Two against nature,"Home movie sound and picture quality is good for nostalgia , but not so good for dvd . If you have to have all things steely dan, buy this,if not let this one go. I personaly only found the need to watch it once, and there was a fair amount of fast forwarding before I realized I just wasn't going to see an entire song without numerous interuptions for interveiws."
3,Well Presented DVD....A Classic Album? Now That's Debatable,"A very well done dvd and a must view for any Steely Dan fan. No fan of the band will be disappointed with this purchase. Just be prepared for more ""words"" than music.Personally, however, I always felt ""Katy Lied"" was the band's best work. Whether or not ""Aja"" can be considered a classic album, worthy of a dvd documentary in the company of albums like the Who's ""Who's Next"" & The Band's ""The Band"" is highly debatable. For the casual Steely Dan fan, best off saving you cash on this one and getting the Steely Dan box set instead."
2,so so,"I bought this with the hope that it would help me study for national boards, but it was not as helpful as I hoped. There are better books with specific strategies."
5,Pop Filter for 21st century,"I'm a songwriter and use high-end digital recording using my iMac to produce excellent results except those darn ""pops"" while singing. I've tried creating my own filters (hoop and sheer stocking) with mixed results and most of the commercial are based along these lines. This filter uses a screen that diverts the puff of air downward and away from the mic. It really works! The tone is slightly crispy but that is easily fixed in the EQ. Pops are a real pain to fix. These artifacts create clipping which in the analog approach creates some interesting effects but in digital recording sounds awful. Every studio needs a pop filter and this one is worth the price. Also, it is sturdy, connects to my mic stand well, and made in USA."
5,Best pop screen out!,"Coming from the old school hip-hop era, I was on the fence about buying one of these for years. I wondered if it would really make a difference opposed to the older nylon design. After buying this wow, everyone has noticed the quality difference including people who aren't even artists. I gave my old nylon one to my friend, and not only do I have one for my home studio. I'm buying one for my engineer's professional studio, a guy who has worked with industry legends! Do yourself a favor and get one!"
4,Soothing,"This is pretty soothing. The music is a bit outdated, but you don't have to listen to it. Nice product."
5,Absolutely Great,"I absolutely love this product, I put it in when I take a nap, when I clean or have company. I highly recommend this set"
1,ridiculously bad,"I was so sorry I gave this as a gift. I was looking for an inexpensive ""fireplace"" type video, and thought this fit the bill. Ugh, it's 15 different scenes of garbage. I could shoot a better ""Atlantic Ocean"" loop by driving down the shore on a cloudy day. ""Gulf of Mexico"" looks like the same beach at a different angle. ""Sunset"" is lame, although it's fun to watch in fast forward and see the distracting boats and birds whiz by. All the fish tanks look like someone filmed them in a pet store. ""Fireworks"" was entertaining, but too short, as the finale kept happening over and over. The River looks like a still photo that someone animated using the ripple effect. The ""best"" one is Psychedelic, sure to induce seizures and/or laughter with it's awful colors and even worse music. I think I ruined Christmas for the unlucky soul I bought this for - they didn't bother trying to regift it, they gave it right back!"
1,cheap and itchy,"looks and feels very low quality, sadly enough. It isn't TOO uncomfortable but it's also not something you want to wear very long at all... but isn't that the point??"
4,Cute Babydoll,"I ordered the navy babydoll, which looks black in the picture, but is a very pretty navy blue in person. I agree with other reviews that the material could be better, but for the price, it isn't bad. The lace is cute. I don't think that the coat adds much, if anything to the babydoll itself. The coat is just a see-thru short sleeved drape. The underwear is the same see-thru material as the babydoll, but it isn't a thong, which can be good or bad depending on which you prefer. The sizing DOES go by the charts which is a big plus. I made the mistake of ordering an extra large babydoll on another website, thinking that they ran a size small, and it is very loose around the chest. I have to tie it tight in the back to make it fit tighter. This babydoll fit me right in a large. Overall, for the price and value, I am happy with it."
3,okay but not really like the picture,"The babydoll top didn't look anything like the picture.I got a large because people said this ran a little small. When I went to put it on the breast area was way too small. It wasn't even a small but still sexy...it just looked way too small. The overcoat was pretty cheap and it didn't have anything to it to make it look even attractive.Fortunately, my boyfriend really likes white so he was able to look past all of its flaws but I would not purchase it again."
2,barely covered,"I love the item but my breasts are a but too big for it. Im 5'7"" and I wear a D cup thinking a medium would fit because I have a small body frame. Now I feel that I have to wear a bra with it :/ if anything, this would be perfect for a bra size smaller than D maybe C."
4,Looks like the same as those made a few years ago,Came as scheduled and they fit. Had some like this before. Hope they last as long as those did.
3,"Great Boot, hard to fit",I returned this boot for a smaller size. I finally ended up with an 11 1/2 after three weeks and return shipping. Quality of boot was outstanding.
2,From Portugal to China,"I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport."
3,"Not true to size, Larger than expected","I ordered three pairs of these over a space of three weeks. I finally got the size I wanted. My experience is that they are a full two sizes larger than what I wanted. I went from a size 13 to a size 11 1/2 before getting it right. The quality is outstanding and with the discounted price it was worth it to return two pair (sizes 13 and 12). Problem is that Amazon does not have a return category for ""does not fit"" and so I had to pay the return shipping. That's OK, at the price of the boots, it was still a steal!"
3,"Great boot, but sizes are not normal","I bought a pair of these for my husband. He wears 11 1/2 wides. I ordered that size and they were more like 12 or 13 reg's. So we gave them to his brother, they fit him perfectly. His brother says they are working out great for him. So the boots are really great quality, just just be careful about what size you choose."
3,"Great Boot, hard to fit","I had to return this boot for a smaller size. I started with a 13, and ended up with an 11 1/2. Quality of the boot is excellent."
2,Disappointed Brat,"Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing."
4,Umbwe Waterproof Trail Boot,"Unlike several earlier purchasers reviewing this boot, I found the boot to be close to the advertised size for me (8 1/2 is my size); I originally ordered a size 8 based on comments that the boot tends to be larger than advertise size; however, the 8 was a VERY snug fit, leaving no extra room for thick socks. I kept this boot for summer type wear, but ordered another size in 8 1/2 for winter wear. So Far, is a very good boot for field trialing dogs.JWP"
4,Score above 700,"My previous math score before I used this book was a 690. So I didn't need a book that covered basic methods, instead I needed a more concentrated skills-practice specific to the SATs. Going through most of this workbook increased my score to a 720. I could have done better if I had practiced up until Friday night. But I was pleased and now I am studying at UPENN. Anyhow, good luck to all of you who are preparing to take the SATs."
5,800...need I say more?,"I used this book, and this book only, and I got an 800. I used Kaplan Verbal and I got a 780. In short, I did WELL. Now I'm on my way to Harvard U, all thanks to this company. It all started in sophomore year when I used Kaplan SAT II Biology and got a 770. Believe, for just a few dollars you will buy yourself Ivy League glory! Indulge."
3,Mediocre intro to the Crusades,"The text of this Osprey title merely rehashs topics that are addressed, in greater detail (and perhaps, greater accuracy) in thousands of other books. Richard Hook's color plates add a lively splash of color, and are accurate if selective in the events and warriors they portray. As others have stated - this is far to grand a topic for a book of 60 pages to attempt to discuss in any detail - this book is a mediocre introduction to the Crusades that is rescued by some exciting artwork."
4,Synopsis from the book,"This Bellerophon Book has 31 Figures from the Christian armies of the west (the Franks), 10 figures from the Byzantine Empire and Central Europe - allies of the Franks (some of the time), and 27 figures of their splendid Muslim foeman. You can deploy them over the same lands of the eastern Mediterranean that are embattled today. Mr. Nicolle, the celebrated scholar of ancient arms, has spared no efforts of research in making these figures authentic."
4,A Fun Romp Through The White House,"An interest in dogs led me to this book-and it's a fun read! If you know any springer spaniels, especially spoiled ones, it will seem like they wrote it. The book's purpose was to raise funds for Mrs. Bush's Literacy Campaign, and the content is non-partisan.The book follows Millie's years as the Bush's companion. The pictures are great, and include captions by Millie and many shots of her puppies. You do get an overview of White House history from a stay-off-the-furniture point of view. Millie has since passed away, but ""her"" book makes you feel like you met her.This book would also be great for a family to read together-some captions are simple enough for early readers, while there are enough pictures to occupy them while older folks handle the text."
5,how can you not like it?,"I ran across this book that I had bought a few years ago and once again was fully entertained by it. We have a Springer Spaniel also, so that made it even more enjoyable. The pictures are fantastic! The story was adorable and gave us a look at how hard life in the White House is for a well loved pet. :) Give it a look, I think you will enjoy."
1,yuck,"I have heard about Cats for years now so thought Id look at it and see what all the fuss was about. I HATED it! Its rather vulgar in spots, lots of catting around and really tragic that the cats finaly gave the OLD cat respect when she was dying and not before...sad and stupid..."
4,DVD,The item shipped quickly and was in its original package with no damage. We were very satisfied with the product.
2,Lyrical,"When I saw Cats on stage, I was up in the rear balcony. I loved the music and dancing but kept thinking I was missing something. I wasn't. The musical is disjointed but it's music and costumes are absolutely stunning. Unless you can afford front row seats, this dvd brings that right to you. My only complaint was the cutting of the pirate ship scene. It's not my favorite musical, hence the two stars, but, for those who love it, a dvd that's up close is a bonus."
1,Gave as a gift,I just found out it never worked. I am not sure how to find out who to send it back to either.......
2,This is just okay,"This was just okay. Kinda of long. And no talking just singing. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah , Blah, Blah, Blah"
3,Eh... highly overrated,"I'm not sure why this has gotten so much attention over the years... make-up? wardrobe? I mean those are nice, I guess and I really do enjoy a few of the songs but overall, I think the musical itself is... remarkably forgettable."
5,A must-have for your DVD collection,"Especially if you have a six-year-old (mine loved it). I had never seen it before and found it amazing. Even if you're not interested in the singing, the costumes and make-up are fantastic. A real classic (Of course)."
4,This is a lovely and useful cookbook,"Now unlike the last cookbook I reviewed, this has real comfort food! It also has great photos for each recipe. Most of them are easy for the average cook. The macaroni and cheese looked and sounded yummy! The desserts were the best. Coconut custard pie and mile-high chocolate layer cake photos made me salivate."
4,Super Reader,"Vampire fairies. Cue many bad jokes of the so bad you can appreciate them variety. How do you kill a vampire fairy? Toothpicks. Buffy has a toothache on top of all the other annoyances, so is not on top of her game.Xander, after a desperate stand outside a donut shop that destroyed many jam filled delicacies is captured and given the Lilliput treatment.The gang go to save him, with many toothpicks, his Slayomatic, and some fairicide."
5,"Wonderful, poetic, biography of the great Mawlana Rumi.","This book is the best biography of Mawlana Jalal uddin Rumi (may his secret be sanctified!) that I have read in the English language to date. The prose itself is absolutely wonderful and is almost poetry in itself! Added to this is Prof. Schimmel's intimate knowledge of the works and life of Mawlana Rumi which she does a wonderful job of presenting. Also, unlike other Orientalist interpreters of Sufism, she firmly places Rumi within the orthodox Islamic framework and ideology/world-view where he belongs. Her translations of his poems are also delightful. This book is highly recommended for all those Muslim and non-Muslim who are interested in the life and works of one of the greatest Saints to ever walk this earth."
1,Really Dull,Ok i have watched a lot of instructional videos some from the 30s this one just does not really teach any thing but termenology.
2,Air Bear?,"I received the air filters in a timely manner, however no where on the package did it say Air Bear. How can I confirm these filters were not a completely different brand. Also the size was 20X25X4, these are thinner than I ordered but they still fit. Going forward I will probably just continue to get my air filters from the Hardware Store. My challange has been that the Air Bear brand is hard to locate in stores."
4,Quality Filter,Quality Filter at half the price my local Heat and Air company charges. Will buy these online from now on.
5,zig beatnik. prolapse-pointless walks to dismal places.,"Prolapse-Pointless walks to dismal places. This gets 5 stars from me as there is no one out there thatsound like this Leicester band. Sure there's some obvious influences eg. The Fall, Joy Division ect. but they have enough fresh ideas to stride ahead of the pack. Noisey, loud, melodic, abstact, male/female, quiet, soft, happy, sadit's all here in this heart felt emotional honest 1st album by Prolapse. All 4 albums are highly recommended, but this was their best!!. Zig Beatnik."
4,Great first album from overlooked band,"This is Prolapse's best recording. The only thing missing from this release is the amazing ""Pull Thru Barker"" which is included on some versions of this album."
5,Just plain AWESOME!,"I totally agree with Griffin on this one. This show is so great! It is too bad that the American public is so interested in ""reality"" shows and garbage of that nature, that they didn't give a show like this a chance. This is REAL reality! People talking about real things! Plus, all done up in an awesome animation style as well. I highly recommend getting this DVD as well as the British versions of this show. There are just so many good moments in these shows, funny ones as well as tender. My most favorite moment is the first scene when two guys are heard talking about ""wine"" but then cut to the animation and... well, I won't tell you. You will just have to BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"
3,Creature Comforts America - Complete Season One,"This American version of Creature Comforts has some funny spots here and there, but doesn't compare to the English version. I would skip this one and buy the other. I must say, I bought this version in error. It wasn't exactly clear to me which version I was getting."
5,laughed so hard i cried!,This show is sooooooo funny! My friends and I found it on Netflix one night and watched it a few times. I loved it so much I had to order it to add to my collection. The characters they put to these interviews are just ridiculous! So random and hilarious. I can't wait to share it with more people!
4,creature comforts,"I like the Brithish version, which was the first to come out. However, the American version is much better and I can't wait for a second season."
4,Endearing and fascinating,"I happened to come across Creature Comforts America on a British Airways flight back to London - it was being screened as part of the inflight entertainment.I'm sad to read it wasn't successful in the US as I thought it gave a brief but fascinating insight into the lives and thoughts of ordinary, every day Americans.The subtle (and hilarious) expressions on each of the animals are a work of art; I found myself becoming somewhat attached to certain charaters - the cockroaches, the Sharks, the Hippo and the couple of cats on the couch. Oh, and who could forget the simple but genuine mother & daughter pigs.A shame no future episodes are planned ... I will miss the series.Recommended."
5,spectacularly funny,"Saddest day of last summer was when they cancelled this show. I like the British version a lot, but this American group has it's own hilarious character. Some say it's not for kids, and I understand why, but my kids roared with laughter. Buy, watch, enjoy!"
2,this is not Wallace and Gromit..thats for sure,"I like this type of animation, especially the way Wallace and Gromit doesit...so when i saw creature comforts i taught it would be the same typeof interesting stories and characters...NOT.Ive seen half of season 1 and i think the rest will be the same:Animals complaining and talking about themselves and the subject dependson the surrounding themes. Looks like 5-10 sets per episodes, and theyswitch back and forth with the animal interviews.... with minimum movements they yap away....blah blah blah........i was not impressed."
2,"Recycled plot from other ""DEA Agents gone bad"" movies","Who cares if I give it away. Most of you have probably seen this flick anyway. No,no....Bad DEA Agents (Christian Slater and Co.) with dirty money in cahoots with scumbags. Bad DEA Agents kill scumbags, someone else gets a hold of the money (19+ something young couple), Bad DEA Agents hunt them down while other cops figure out DEA Agents are the ""bad guys"" not the kids who stole their (DEA) money. DEA and kids tussle a bit, someone is killed (guess which side?) and finally Bad, Bad DEA Agents (CS and Co.) die. Someone gets away/off; ""significant other"" dies.I think that about sez it all. Not one of Christian Slater's better efforts (read stinker. See Hard Rain)."
5,Highly recommended,"Excellently written, cleverly organized and richly illustrated book that can be considered a very valuable addition to the library of surgical residents and seasoned clinicians involved in advanced bone grafting."
4,Bone,Well writen. Author wastes no words. Right to the meat of the subject so that the reader should have no problem in making practical use of this subject matter.
3,Humming,"This thing has a habit of making whatever sound you're listening to hum while it's plugged in, usually with a bit of fiddling I can get it to stop. Other then that it's a alright charger, though a longer cord would have been nice."
5,Satisfaction,Just to let you know that I'm very satisfy with this product.The arrival of this item was amazing.More then happy all around.
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I agree with ""A consumer"" comment. It doesn't not charge my ipod but it seems to kill the battery while plugged in."
5,A Must Have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Product Is A great must have. Once Plug Up to the I Pod It will take the I pod A least 30 min to have a great Charge. I employ people to buy this. It is Great.....
1,Doesn't work with 4th Gen Nano,"Word of warning: it doesn't work with 4th gen. iPod Nano.Since I have a largely useless charger, I'll comment on its other attributes:Overall Construction: lightweight plastic, somewhat angular edges. The connector seems a bit on the cheap side and is wide enough that I have to unplug the headphones from the Nano while charging (assuming it'd charge my 4th Gen. Nano). The cord's also a bit shorter than necessary, but it's not been a major problem since I can't charge anything anyway.Minuses: Won't charge my 4th Gen. Nano, cord's a bit short, connector is too wide to keep headphones plugged in.Pluses: Price, cheap enough that I can throw it away since it won't charge my 4th Gen. NanoBuy unless you have a 4th gen. Nano."
3,I never used it. Go buy an offical apple iPod USB Adapter.,"When I first but this charger for myApple iPod classic 160 GB Black (6th Generation)I thought this came directly from Apple. When I found out this wasn't the case I returned it. Mainly because I have heard horror stories about chargers that do not come from the actual manufacter of the MP3 Player. Like how the third party chargers could wear out your batter thus ruining your MP3 Player or in this case my iPod Classic. So, I would advise costumers to buy an officialApple USB Power Adapter for iPod/iPhoneif they cost thirty dollars it probably means it comes with a free sync cable if it is cheaper than twenty dollars. It probably means they will give the charger but not the extra cable."
1,horrible product,"Actually worked the first time, but then fried my battery so badly that it now only plays for an hour before needing recharged. I'll probably have to replace my nano much sooner than anticipated, so this definitely isn't a product I'd recommend to anyone who values their ipod."
1,"Charger does not work, worse the seller is unresponsive, worst, Amazon is still selling it!","I concur with the previous reviews that talk to the fact that the phone charger actually discharges their devices - the battery in my iPhone actually dies faster when this is plugged into it. But worse than this is the fact that BargainCell is unresponsive to my email asking what to do, and worst of the bunch is Amazon to continue selling this obviously defective product. Shame on you! I only gave it one star because Amazon would not let me give it 0 stars!"
3,Misleading title and picture,"The picture of the white power adapter and the title of ""Apple iPod Travel Charger"" is a bit misleading. What I got was a black knock-off made by some random chinese company. The prongs don't even retract.I'm stilling giving some stars though because I only paid ~$3 bucks for it which is less then I paid for my coffee today."
2,"Yeah, it charges, but...","I've had problems using my iPod touch while it was plugged in. If it's not plugged in to the iPod all the way, and even sometimes if it is, it interferes with the touch screen. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to the iPod.Also, the LED indicator light is very bright, so not good for putting next to your bed. It also heats up a great deal.So it charges, but no telling if there is any long term damage being done to the battery."
2,Not reliable,"I got this charger to charge my iPod Touch while I am on travel. The charger did its job the first time. On subsequent attempts to charge my device, the charger did not work. The battery was actually drained! This product is of low quality and I cannot recommend it. At the low cost, it is not even feasible to return the product for a refind. I give it 2 stars because I may just have a defective unit."
1,Junk,"I've had one of these for some time for my iPod Nano gen 4, and it worked fine.A few weeks ago I bought a second for my wife's same iPod. The new one stopped charging after a week. I plugged it into the iPod, and nothing happened.The first one that had been good, at about the same time the new one died, decided to leave one of its prongs in the wall outlet when I removed it.Also, the plastic has a cheap feel to it.The search for a good quality charger for the Nano gen 4 continues."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH IPOD 4TH GEN,"DOES NOT WORK WITH IPOD 4TH GENERATION, PERIOD. PLUG IN AND IT SAYS CAN NOT CHARGE BECAUSE NOT RECOGNIZE CHARGER."
1,CAUTION: IT FRIED / DESTROYED TWO IPODs !!!!!,"CAUTION: This charger fried both my and my daughter's Ipod Touch!!!!!! The charger worked fine for 3 months, however in one day it destroyed the ipods without warning. I didn't realize it was the charger untill it ruined my daughter's Ipod too. I usually read the reviews before purchasing, but for the unbelievable price I just bought it. After buring up both Ipods I read all the negative reviews, but it was too late. Unfortunately my Ipod was out of Apple's warranty period. THIS CHEAP CHARGER IS NOT WORTH BURNIING UP A $350 IPOD. DO NOT RISK IT. IT IS WORSE THAN GARBAGE. This A/C adapter does not comply with American/Canadian UL Standards. It is poorly made and puts your expensive electronics at risk.I congratulate you for being smart and savy enough to read this review before purchasing. Do not buy this charger."
5,Ipod Charger,Charges great! Good product. I only wish that the cord was a bit longer since I keep it plugged in the outlet behind my bed.
4,Great!,Thanks so much!This was great! And speedy delievery :)Product works great too just wish the cord was longer....
4,great and not pricey,"this thing works great and does the job for my iphone 4, no sense in paying the $$ for the apple one."
4,Very satisfied I purchased this.,"I was moderately satisfied to have purchased the wall charger (I use it with my ipod nano). It works just fine and am so happy to be able to charge my ipod via a wall outlet rather than my computer. My only negative is the length of the cord which is only 34 inches long. However, I am now ecstatic to have purchased this after seeing the price of a wall charger in Apple's store: $29. What?! Twenty nine bucks for basically a little freakin' adapter. Absolutely ridiculous. Just another way apple nickel and dimes all their customers to death."
2,GP,"I ordered two chargers....one was perfect, the other charger was already damaged in the sealed package. I believe the sender knew it was damaged....a two year old could see it!!"
4,cheap and works great,I needed a cheap charger for my ipod on my trip to ND for a marathon. The nano doesn't come with a wall charger and it was always a pain having to plug it into my computer. This was just what I needed at a great price!
1,Did NOT Work,First I waited forever for this to arrive from Hong Kong. Then it simply didn't work. I didn't buy it because it was so cheap. I bought it because it sounded just right. Instead it was - - So Wrong. Do not buy this product.
1,Does not work with iPod Touch 4G,"I paid $2.69 for this with free shipping, so it is not worth returning, but it did not work at all with my iPod Touch 4G. I couldn't even get it to stay in any of my outlets without falling out. As far as I'm concerned, it's a piece of junk. Maybe it's not supposed to work with the iPod Touch. It's hard to tell when you read the description."
1,ITS NOT FOR IPHONE 3GS,"I needed this charger badly and i was looking forward to it, but when i tryed it it said this charger is not supported by this device!! and now i cant return it cuz i'll have to pay the shipment and i dont think it is worth it to pay for the return shipment. so becarefull its not for iphone 3gs"
1,Terrible charger,The charger head broke after a week of use and it broke the connection in my Ipod Touch! Piece of junk! Don't buy!!!
2,Works with my iTouch 4G but...,"This charger works fine but the cord length is way too short. It is about 2-2 1/2 feet long, which for me is too short. I wanted this to be able to use my iPod and charge it at the same time, but now to do that I need an extension cord."
3,No Good for iPod 3G,I bought 2 of these for my kids. It works for the 4GiPhone but does not charge the 3GiPod at all. I have contacted the seller and advised them not to advertise that it works for 3G iPod if it doesn't.
1,BAD CHARGER DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I purchased this charger in December of 2010 for my iPod. I noticed that the device would only stay charged for about an hour before the iPod alerted that it needed to be charged again. I thought this was a bit odd given that when it had been charged by my desktop computer the charge would last much longer. Over the last few weeks I would charge my iPod over night to try to remedy this problem. But even then the iPod would quickly display that the iPod's battery was almost dead. Now when I charge my iPod from my desktop computer the battery does not charge for that long anymore either. I seriously believe that this type of charger has everything to do with it. It was a good thing that the 2nd charger that I purchased was delivered damaged because this charger would have damaged my other iPod. I strongly do not recommend buying this charger and if I could, I would have given these chargers a zero star rating."
3,Mine didn't light up green when fully charged,"Okay, 3 stars only because the charger does work & fully charges my Ipod but the indicator light does not light up green when it is done causing me to just take a guess when it's done all the time. It is kind of a pain but I only paid $4.49 for it so I wasn't expecting it to be great & it's too much of a pain to exchange it so I just use it & make do with it.."
4,"Sometimes has a loose connection, but overall fine","The charger is slightly more bulky than what I was looking for but the Apple chargers are so expensive! This charger, though it looks ugly, works ok. I have had a few instances where the connection drops but I just push the cable back into my iPod and it charges."
5,Great little charger,I was a little skeptical because of how cheap it was but I was impressed. It works great! No problems.
3,Died after 6 mo.,"Worked fine for about 6 mo. For the price seems like a cheap enough total cost. I have purchased 3 total non-apple chargers, one died after 6 mo, one after 6 days the other is in second month use. If you want quality and reliability stay with a name brand."
5,charger for nana,works great. i really bought it for my ipod but my boyfriend jux bought me a new iphone so now i can use it for both
4,It works,For less than $5 I wasn't expecting anything special. The charger works well and the end locks in nice and tight on my Ipod. Bought two and I would buy agian.
3,Ok for the price,"You certainly can't complain about the price. I've had this charger for 6 months. At first it worked fine but after about a month, it keeps losing connection during charging. I keep my ipod on the kitchen counter while charging and you can constantly hear the beep when it loses connection. It is a pain."
5,Great product,I am forever running my i Pod out of juice when I am away from my laptop so the charger is so nice.
1,Total Waste,I ordered this charger for my little brother's 3rd gen ipod nano and it wont fit. it's too big or not even made for the ipod. total waste dont buy
2,they work great IF you do NOT have a otterbox,"as I said, they do not work with a otterbox, too wide, had to grid down the sides to use. Other than that they are a great price."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,Do not buy these chargers. Prongs on plugs are slanted and do not fit US designed outlets. Should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon. Shipped from HONG KONG!?
2,weak pulse,"This DVD is not a patch on the original VHS release. The camera angles are different, with some of the VHS shots and angles cut out altogether. The sound quality is also pretty poor. One expects to get the same film on DVD as on VHS if the title etc is the same. Bitter disappointment!!"
4,"If you are a Pink Floyd fan - this is a ""must have""","Pink Floyd - PulseIt is a shame the original concert was taped and not filmed. Can you imagine how great this DVD would be if it had a HDTV wide-screen option? However, the sound quality makes up for the 4:3 video. The remix is top-notch.Songs are from all parts of the Pink Floyd era - something to please everyone. If you are a Dark Side of the Moon fan, this DVD pulls out all the stops on disk two. Make sure your sub-woofer is cranked up for the heartbeat - kick back and enjoy!"
5,the best of PinkFloyd..live,if your into Pink Floyd like me you got to have this it is the best takes you on a trip of there music and great vidio to go along with it
3,Great concert - not so good DVD,"After waiting years to see Pulse on DVD, I have to say I am disappointed with the DVD. The concert is amazing, but as already posted in other reviews, it was shot in video instead of film. The result is clearly visible and the image quality is poor - too bad, as the visual effects would look amazing on a large screen.Anyway, it is still a must-have for Pink Floyd fans. You might be a little disappointed with the image quality, but you will definitely not regret your purchase."
1,Bootleg?,"I haven't seen a version of Pulse on DVD that looks like this. The version that is in stores is two discs and contains a different image. It's in 5.1 and has extras, as well as the concert paced out over two discs. This one looks to be best avoided."
5,"While not Blu-Ray, this DVD is amazing!!!","The other reviews here are pretty much spot on. I was amazed by the quality of sound this DVD version provides. Now I think I understand all the delays that were involved in getting this DVD version released. I watched it start to finish today and was taken aback. Having witnessed the Delicate Sound of Thunder at Texas Stadium back in '87, under the influence of hallucinagenic fun time stuff (dont get all hoity toity on me, David Gilmour even admitted that show was designed to ""enhance"" the trip, plus most of you old farts were tripping right there beside me), there will never be an equal to that experience.That was one of the last times I dropped Acid so I didnt get the full-effect that this DVD probably has to offer. If you happen to dabble in that stuff still, I suggest a four-way fighter pilot harness attached to your couch. This concert is incredible. Excellent performance."
4,"Pink Floyd ""Pulse"" DVD","If you are a Pink Floyd fan, you will truly enjoy this double DVD video. The absence of Rick Waters on bass and vocals is regrettable from a nostalgia point of view, but the music and show does not suffer as a result. The Pink Floyd sound quality and light show production are once again, the BEST in the music and entertainment industry. WOW!David Glimour is at the top of his form as well. My only regret is that is is not offered in Blu-Ray. Buy it now.Gary D."
1,While waiting...,"Get Roger Waters ""In The Flesh"" DVD if you do not have it already. Yeah it might not have all the pretty lights, glitterballs, and pyros that ""PULSE"" has but it has one thing that ""PULSE"" does not have... a performance from a band with a lot of heart, and someone leading the band (Roger Waters) who cares more about the message of the music than just a lightshow with nice backround music."
3,No Roger / No Pink Floyd,"I have seen the Dave Gilmour band both live during the 1994 'Pink Floyd' tour and also seen this video. The material written by Roger Waters when he was with the band is performed great. Post Roger Waters material is average at best. I find it painful to listen to the songs ""The Division Bell"" or ""The Dogs Of War"". They are an attempt to copy a sound rather than create music. Without ""The Division Bell"" album Dave Gilmour would never have been able to promote a 'Pink Floyd' stadium tour. David Gilmour in concert would sell 10,000 seats. David Gilmour under the Pink Floyd banner sold out stadiums.If you want to listen to ""The Dark Side Of The Moon"" catch Roger Waters on tour this summer, if you can get a ticket. He doesn't need the name Pink Floyd to sell tickets."
1,Don't waste your money...,PF died when Roger left...He and Syd founded the band ... without them it was all just a downhill grab for money.Who needs Gilmours drone of a voice ... (He was a good backing singer - but a horrible lyricist).And yeah - He wanks away on guitar ... but there are a million guitarists who can play just as good - you'll just never hear of them because they didn't have the good fortune to rest upon someone elses laurels.REMEMBER- David was simply a replacement for Syd.Nothing more than a session guy.
2,Just Breezecuse,"1 star is to dull but five are to hot- maybe not=and comon will this review make or break your decision?? Oh then buy it. what they dont tell you is its 2 discs 1 is mostly post waters stuff and the other is mostly DSOTM, It sounds great and if your worried about how it looks then maybe you should be wasting your money on a music DVD Im sure you dont need me to tell you about The Pink Floyd sound as they were formerly called."
2,Something's missing,"While the concert is technically sound I ofter wonder about 2 things: Why another concert video and what's missing from their perfromance? I have no answer for the why except the lure of money but as to what's missing, it's Roger Waters. For anyone interested in hearing a good amount of Pink Floyd music in concert I highly reccommend In The Flesh as a better way to get more bang for your buck."
1,Very Bad Sound - Not acceptable !!!!!!!!!!!!,"The sound is so bad you don't get pleasure from it. Sometimes you see the drums and you barely hear them.All the fans wanted a DVD from this great tour, but if this tour has not been recorded with correct technology, the DVD shouldn't go out.I understand why it took so long to produce this DVD, a band like Pink Floyd was certainly against the record company to issue the DVD. This DVD is very bad for the reputation of the band, which has always been the leader in music technology. The cover of the DVD should mention ""historical document with poor sound quality""."
5,Pulse DVD,"The item is extraordinary.Not only the best sound of the concert, but also some ""jewels"" as bonus (TV add, the award, etc.)"
5,Ken845,I love Floyd but I miss Roger it's just not Pink Floyd Without Him don't get me wrong i still love Floyd. The Show was great and putting dark sidelive in it's entirty was a great testament to their loyalty to their fansthis was one of the all time great concerts the extra's could have been better but the concert more than makes up for it. Davids guitar solo's were supreme no other guitar player can play the strat as smooth and sweet and when it comes time for the more aggresive songs well let's just say david hasn't lost anything with age.
3,Not as Great as I was Hoping...,"I attended this tour and the show seemed better at the time. Still worth having, but a few points:-Why did they cut Astronomy Domine and Hey You? They should have left them in and taken out the stuff from Momentary Lapse of Reason, which we have seen already on DSOT.--The sax player DOES NOT have a ridiculous mullet like the dude in DSOT.__What;s with the percussion player jumping around like a madman?--Some of the lighting is too bright and harsh, it washes out the show.--The DVD sound is decent, not spectacular like I was hoping.All in all, worth having, but not the greatest.You really need to have Live at Pompeii.--Just my 2 cents"
2,Incredible Concert - poor video quality,"After waiting so long for this release, I can't believe the poor video of the concert footage - the dark sequences of the concert pixelate and pulse, like the footage was compressed too much. Do I have a bad copy, or does anyone else have this problem?"
2,Mixed Bag,"""Pink Floyd"" without Roger Waters is not Pink Floyd, and this concert demonstrates exactly why. The performances are slick and soulless; the remaining three band members go through the motions without much emotion or chemistry, as most of the emotional power and angst that characterized classic Pink Floyd came from the genius of Waters.The over-the-top light show is ridiculous but serves effectively to distract the viewer from the mediocre musical performance.This is a flashy, carefully-produced presentation of Pink Floyd music by three talented guys, but it feels like a stale nostalgia act when stripped of the gravitas, poetry and feeling that Waters brought to the band. These are great songs, no doubt, and it's nice to watch Gilmour lay it down on lead guitar. However at the end of the day it just feels like more spectacle than substance."
2,NOT THE GREATEST GIG IN THE SKY!!!,"I AM SHOCKED TO READ HOW SO MANY FOLKS THOUGHT THIS TOUR WAS BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ""DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER!""DSOT WAS SUPERB IN BOTH, AUDIO & VIDEO QUALITY AS WELL AS THE BAND AND BACK-UP SINGERS PERFORMING FAR BETTER THAN PULSE!SHAME ON ANYONE WHO DOESN'T SEE OR HEAR THE DIFFERENCES....GO WATCH AND LISTEN TO DELICATE.....AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!"
2,"The ""centerpeice"" is lacking...apparently.","I bought this for my dad, who wanted it mainly for the ""Dark Side of the Moon"" performance, and he was very disappointed in it. He said it just wasn't played like other versions and it could have been WAY better. The rest of the performances made up for that somewhat.I think we can all agree that when we buy something for one main reason, and that reason turns out to suck, it's a disappointing purchase all around, no matter what the other features are."
2,Stay with VHS Version,"Forgive me...and forgive me David Gilmour. For years he is my hero (speaking as a fellow guitar player) but the audio and video quality is quite bad. I know they had issues with transferring to DVD and I am heart broken.I purchased 2 copies of this concert, excited because I had waited so long to compliment my sister's and my VHS version, and am now too embarrased to send my sister her copy. I am returning both to Amazon and hope they compensate adequately since one copy is opened.Video quality is quite bad, and much of the concert is so blown out with bright white light, that zero detail is retained, (for a good part of the concert!) compared to VHS version. Audio quality will make even the best speakers sound tinny or rumble from bass.David is my hero and I know he was reluctant (and worked hard) to make this on DVD, but I will stick with my VHS version. It is like night and day, quality-wise) by comparison."
3,Incredible Concert!,This DVD will not disappoint. I only wish that Roger Waters was still with them so I don't have to double up on my purchases because the split took incredible talent in two different directions. Waters and Gilmour both took talent with them and they could only be better if they were together. I am still holding out for a reunion. The quality of this production is so much better than my VHS. If you don't have this in your collection you should have your classic rock organ removed from your body.
5,Fortunately....,"...somebody issued a DVD version of the PULSE Laserdisc so I was able to see this excellent concert, as I missed out on the original VHS and Laserdisc releases over 10 years ago. I pre-ordered this official DVD and am patiently waiting for it's arrival, as I watch the bootleg at least once a week.The CD soundtrack is quite different from the music in the DVD, as other reviewers have noted. The new 5.1 soundtrack on the upcoming DVD is probably the cause of the delay in relase of the official DVD of PULSE."
4,Nice To Have in Your Collection,"Nice video for Pink Floyd fans or those who want to have a video playing during a party that has a broad appeal. Video is acceptable as is audio. Yes it can be picked apart, but with some video processing and external EQ, it's pretty darn good."
2,Gilmore sounds horrible,The show is great. The effects are amazing but David Gilmore sounds horrible in most songs. His delivery is boring and flat and seems like he is just going through the motions. I love his voice but this is a terrible performance by him in my opinion.
5,Que se puede decir es Pink Floyd,"Por mucho tiempo que pase, Pink Floyd sigue siendo el grupo mas increible que haya existido. Es cierto que hace falta Waters en esta gira, pero es realmnete uno de los mejores conciertos que he visto en mi vida.Le puse 5 estrellas por que no hay mas pero si pudiera le pusiera 10.Les recomiendo"
5,FANTASTIC!,"I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, and already own Pulse on VHS. The new 2 DVD set is a huge improvement in sound quality, and I love all the extra features, especially "" bootlegging the bootleggers"", and the roadies behind the scenes documentary. The ease with which you can navigate this DVD for your favorite songs a definate plus over the VHS version. For true Floyd fans, this concert DVD is it's the next best thing to being there!"
5,PULSE gave me chills........,"I've never been so moved by watching a concert on a television. Somehow the soul of this performance transcends beyond the pixels of the TV.I've been waiting for years for this DVD to come out and finally, after the long wait it's here. This is with out a doubt one of the best concerts to have ever been put on. Even after all these years PULSE still sets the bar for brilliance in showmanship, musical genius and theatrics. If you have never seen this I feel very sorry for you. There are no adjectives in the English dictionary to describe this concert. It just has to be seen to be believed.This concert took me away and brought me to a place I've never been to. The atmosphere and magnitude of it all is almost uncanny, but Pink Floyd made it a reality. I will treasure this DVD for years to come."
5,Pink Floyd P.u.l.s.e,I would like to know when this video will be on DVD. So I could have a very special collection in my life.....
5,"At long last, it's here!","The second that I saw this, I bought it. I had been hearing for YEARS that this was coming to DVD, and I'm so glad that it finally did.Pink Floyd never delivers anything ""sub-standard"", and this double disc is no exception. The sound is superb (if you son't have a surround system, this concert is worth getting one), and the visuals, though a bit dated, are as clear as you can get. After too many years of the VHS copy, this is almost like seeing it for the first time all over again.On a side note, I noticed that ENIGMA is now replaced by E=MC2 behind them during ""Another Brick in the Wall"". Publius apparently has gone underground for the DVD."
5,A Must for all Floyd Fans,"If you have ever seen Pink Floyd live then this will bring back wonderful memories. The picture quality is great, especially when viewed on a high quality television or monitor. The two disks are packed with so many hours of extras it is almost too much to take in one sitting so give yourself time. Pulse is well worth the price and belongs in any true Pink Floyd fan's collection.I only regret not seeing them live again. Will it ever happen?"
5,Available at last on DVD!!,"Yeah think they have the release date wrong - the same disc on the UK Amazon site has a release date of January 17 2006.Brilliant DVD of a jaw-dropping concert. I was lucky enough to be at Earl's Court in London on the night they shot this video. Never seen anything like it before or since - the special effects were just out of this world, as was the music. We were treated to Dark Side all the way through without a break. Ended with Comfortably Numb with the huge glitter ball lowered down from the roof before it opened up in a hail of lasers and dry ice and Run Like Hell where they threw everything they had at it for a spectacular finale. An unbelievable experience and one that has taken far too long to make it to DVD! Very excited to put this through it's paces on a decent system and TV!"
2,Fantastic concert marred by poor video quality,"Artistically this concert is great, but all I can say is that I hope someday it is released on Blu-Ray, properly upconverted to 16:9. Do not miss the note on the back: ""Concert footage restored, re-edited and presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio."" Unfortunately what this really means is that it really doesn't look very good on a modern HD widescreen TV - the video is very grainy, and displays letterboxed as standard def. I have a lot of other standard def concerts that look fine when played on an upconverting DVD player, but this one just is not one of them."
3,Who screwed up the vocals on this great Pink Floyd performance,"The stage, instruments, video,fireworks, light shows, etc. were wonderful, but you can barely hear any of the vocals on this DVD. On record the vocals on DSOTM jump out at you, on this DVD you can barely make out what they are singing. If you were not a Floyd fan and knew the lyrics, you will be greatly disappointed by the weak vocals on an otherwise wonderful performance. Who or what the hell happened here? I want to hear David and those sexy backup singers sing the lyrics over the other instruments, not be drowned out by them. Who can we crucify and blame for this significant problem with the vocals?"
5,Pink Floyd improved,"I have seen Pink Floyd several times live over the years.The original members of course.I kind of was disappointed when they lost Roger Waters.I watched a few of the tracks on this DVD on youtube and loved them,so I bought this dvd.This is Pink Floyd on steroids!I did not think Pink Floyd could improve but they did.The music on this dvd is awesome,the show is even better.If your a Pink Floyd fan,BUY this..you will not be disappointed"
5,Awesome!,I saw this concert on my local PBS station and had to have for my collection. The sound quality and light show were over the top. Pink Floyd is the No. 1 all time rock band on my chart. Amazon.com delivered a winner.
4,Is this not what you expected to see?,"Come on people Pink Floyd is the greatest psycedelic rock band in history, so just quit your whining and wait a couple of months. Besides seriously folks ""Pulse"" is a great concert but come on no Roger Waters? Even that was the closest they could muster for their fans. Gilmour and Waters should just get wasted some night, get over there differences and realize that there music is about their fans. And for gods sake either tour soon again or fans like myself will have never gotten the chance to see a living legend. But if another tour really is out of the question, how about one of those DVDs of all live footage live Zeppelin's How the West Was One, that sounds comperable."
1,My dealer was a ripoff!,"The dealer was a cheat , received an already opened article and resealed. I sent the article back and offer me $15.00 freight for my being a happy customer and $3.50 for the VHS which cost me $60.00. He's got the article and never paid anything.Beware of these sharks: Harold W. MorrisonBorn-Again-Books"
5,DVDDVDVDVDVDVDVDVDVDVD??????,"This concert video is without a doubt the best one I have ever seen, but why is not being published in DVD yet? We all have heard of release dates going back to early this year, but to no avail. Even Roger's 2000 tour is about to go on DVD pretty soon, so it is listed on Amazon's listing; in fact you can pre-order that one."
3,Pink Floyd Pulse,"A great sounding, looking DVD but its missing one thing the madman, the poet the heart of Pink Floyd Roger WatersIn the Flesh is much better !"
1,delay is provoking mass bootleg productions,"Hey, David! What is such a big deal to delay this DVD. Do you know how many people around the world waiting for it. The result of this long delay is mass production of bad quality bootlegs from Russia and other countries made from VHS tapes.Even after the date of official release was announced it's still has been delayed three times and afterwords the real release date is unknown. If anybody knows what's goind on, please,wtite about it.By the way, the same story is with ''DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER'' DVD."
1,In 2010 DVDs will probably be phased out for new technology.,"In 2010 DVDs will probably be as outdated as VCRs are. I hope they are kidding with a 2010 release date for Pulse. What is the hold up? Legal battles with Rodger? Did David lose the master recordings? I would personal throw all my Pink Floyd DVDs, and videos in the bin and set fire to them if it meant an earlier release date for Pulse.Enough is enough!1 star is the rating for the length of time it has taken for Pulse to be released on DVD not for the concert itself. Live at Pompei and London 66 - 67 were released on DVD and they are worth one viewing and then straight into the bin. Cmon! If you think I am going to wait 4 more years for Pulse on DVD, guess again Pink Floyd."
2,Reason #2 why I dislike DVDs,Sanitized Floyd material played by about 56 musicians...(some are below the stage)....Gilmour took total control and the band suffered. This is the only thing captured on film.
5,The long wait is over...,"...however I'm still (and probably hopelessly) waiting also for ""Delicate sound of thunder"" to appear on DVD... :)But talk about ""Pulse"" is all done, all words have been said about that concert and the only thing what has been left, is to watch and listen the masters of rock."
5,Release the DVD,"This is perhaps the best consert ever put on film, the DVD would sell like hotcakes. Please release this great concert on DVD so we can all view it at its best."
5,"Perhaps the most exciting, best produced live performance of all time!","As an avid Pink Floyd fan, I was speechless the first time I saw Pulse. The production must have cost in excess of a million dollars, the show was filled with the best - ever changing - images and sounds. If a Pink Floyd fan doesn't have this in their collection they are truely missing out. This is a great show for a lights out volume up experience that will BLOW THE MIND AND SENSES!"
5,Amazing Concert,I'm not a Pink Floyd fan. I bought this as a gift for someone else. He talked me into watching it and I must say I am impressed. This is as good a concert as I have EVER seen.
5,Great DVD but what's up with the production crew extra,I always consider Pink Floyd to be a class act. As they have said the music is the important thing. Not about them. After seeing the concert in 1994 I see what they mean. Great DVD but I thought the production crew extra didn't fit in. Mainly the couple of geeks that spend most of their time chasing down beer and acting stupid. That would be something you would find on a Motley Crue Dvd.
5,Best Pink Floyd DVD,"This is the closest you can get to actually being at a Pink Floyd concert. One of the best concert DVDs Ive seen! They don't try to fill with other junk, just a great production of the concert. And Pink Floyd's concerts were the best!"
1,What Is Everyone Talking about? Dvd's A Sham to Buyers-10,"Waited so long for this dvd to come out.Bought one took it back what did they do to the dvd Nothing.Totally dissapointed in everything Picture quality, Audio,What am I missing that everyone is talking about.Its the best dvd by P- F.My opinion Its the worst.Watched all extras Urinals Gilmour throwing lamp across room in hotel.Band saying it sucks to be in rock group. Band ask how it feels to work with rock star.Let you know when I find one:people say this is a great 2 set dvd.Is everyone deaf dumb & blind? I feel Its nothing more than a remake of the VHS.With some extras not that great to watch I give this 2 set dvd a -10."
1,This is not Pink Floyd,"Why people buy this?I dont know.This is a bad dvd.Buy Roger Waters dvd ""in the flesh""; best music dvd ever.Dont buy PULSE dvd. This is fake dvd. The first part is some new stuff from pink floyd(extr bad)The second part(like tribute band)WARNING!!!!!DONT BUY"
1,"Pulse, A Dead One That Is !","Bitterly disappointed with the audio of this DVD, Sorry I bought it and I LOVE Floyd !!!!!"
1,Aspect Ratio,"This product was suppose to be 1.33:1 but on the product and on television, it is clearly ASPECT RATIO 4:3. Please change your description of the product. It was not what I wanted..."
1,I didn't receive my purchase yet!!!!!!!!,I cant't write a review just because i didn't receive my purchase yet.Where's my stuff???
4,Pluse is a must-have for Pink Floyd fans,The music choices are classic Floyd. The music quality of the DVD is 4/5 (Eagles having 5/5). It is one of the top DVDs in my collection.
4,Pink Floyd's Pulse,"Stellar light show, awesome performance from one of the greatest classic rock bands. Pink Floyd seems to get better with age!"
5,Perfect Pink,"Best music video I own, everyone should have this in their library. Disc #2 especially because it has dark side of the moon."
5,Music that will go down in history!,"Being a product of the end of the ""Baby Boomers"" PINK FLOYD was the music of my formative years. Unlike most people, I think that ""Wish You Were Here"" is the best album of Pink Floyd. ""Pulse"" is a really good compilation of most of the greatest music from the group. From the beginning track of ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" to the next to last ""Comfortably Numb"" (and the last track is good, too!) I throughly love this album/dvd. With overcomming the personal issues that permeate among the band, it was great to see them come together and do a spectacular concert. I would recommend this to any fan of Pink Floyd as they will have a fantastic set of music from one of the greatest groups of the 60's-90's!"
5,Pulse,AWESOME!!!! I loved it the first time I saw it and have watched it 5 times!! It is done so well - Gilmore gives it his all!
4,Live Pulse Concert,"This is one of the best performances for Pink Floyd on dvd I have ever seen.Mason and Gilmour,are in there peak even without Waters.This is a live concert and there is a little more ovations, and crowd participation than I care for,but if I was there ,I'd be doing the same."
3,"Very anticipated DVD, I'm slightly disappointed.","After many years of waiting for this concert to be put on DVD, many of us die hard Pink Floyd fans were expecting and anticipating something great, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed. Everybody talks about the great sound quality. I don't hear it. I have a High quality Denon DVD player(it is only 2 years old - I guess this is already outdated for the new mix), Somebody please tell me how I can get this great new 5.1 mix - 640kbps that is in the Audio Setup - Maybe I'm missing something. Don't get me wrong, this is a great band and a great concert, I'm just not hearing this great new sound. I have many great Concert DVDs and I can definetely tell when there is good sound. This DVD, I had to turn up louder than normal just to get the BIG effect that I was expecting. Overall, nice DVD; however just not Great like I was expecting."
5,2010 ... Come on ... Please fix it,"Dear friends,As Floydian fan I can't wait that long for the P.U.L.S.E.DVD release. I'm sure that this '2010' is not correctso please tell us when will the DVD see the light.I've already pre-ordered 2 units.All the best, clear skies and shine on"
5,Hopefully I haven't sold my Pulse's Laserdisc yet...,"What's going on with these EMI guys?, I almost sold my LD version of Pulse (not as complete as this promised DVD)..."
5,Most Incredible Pink Floyd on Video!,This the the best live Floyd you'll ever see laid down on video! The sound is incredible! Please release this in DVD format! Thanks!
1,I never received it,"I never received the item and forgot about it until you sent me this email. I did receve the other item I ordered with it, but I assumed this DVD was coming in a separate shipment."
2,A real letdown,"If you already have the ""bootleg"" DVD don't waste your $ on this, it's only a small bit better. Quality of the picture is PATHETIC!!Concert itself is wonderful.PF should be ashamed with this!A BIG disapointment"
1,When will it come in?,"Well, Amazon says shipping to me feb 6-8th. Is this Bull.... I pre ordered this & have been waiting over 3 months, not to mention 10 years. Is it really coming out in Sept???"
1,2010 or When Pigs Fly !!!,Hope I'm still alive to upgrade my fuzzy VHS to DVD.Looks like it won't be released until pigs have wings...
5,Absolutely STUNNING! The penultimate in rock concert video.,"Obviously nothing compares to actually being at the concert. This video (and it's near sister, Delicate sound of thunder) delivers with intimate camera work displaying the artists, the lasers, the props and the audience in a cohesive mix with soundtrack audio that will leave the viewer fully satisfied. The visual imagery on cuts like High Hopes, the lasers during Comfortably Numb, the fact that the ENTIRE Dark Side of the Moon album is performed with cutting precision are just a few of the reasons this video is a ""must have"" in any collection. A technical masterpiece."
4,Guy Pratt ruins an amazing Pink Floyd performance,"It's brilliant to watch this again. Brings back fond memories of the few times I was lucky enough to see them play. The show really was out of this world.It's a shame that the session bassist ""Guy Pratt"" completely misses the sense of Pink Floyd's bass sound and makes many of the songs sound more like Level 42. Jesus - stop slapping the damn thing man! It's just awful! One star deducted for that!Also - it's a real shame it's in 4:3 format or HD - I guess they didn't think widescreen was going to catch on in 1995 when it was filmed. Each set must have cost millions... you'd think they might have had the sense to use real film instead of 'high quality' video! Bad move!"
2,Disappointing,"The only band member who gets any kind of footage is Gilmour. There are fleeting glimpses of others, but the editing is edgy and rather amateurish. I'm sure the light show was most spectacular at the event, but hours of footage of crowds wandering about and the band in the far distance soon becomes boring. Sound is good, but extras and of little value."
3,Pulse,"Dont get me wrong, i love floyd, but i couldnt stand watching this video. The concert from a visual point of view is amazing of course but it seems that gilmours vocals were missing something (like his english accent). To me it was like watching a cover band play. But everything was flawless as you would expect from this band. if you want to see an excellent video of floyd live get ""the delicate sound of thunder"" i feel it is way better. When are we gonna see ""the wall live"" on video or dvd?"
3,Better than Delicate but they can do better,This has some really great visuals but the songs have nothing new or fresh in them. Gilmour looks like he doesn't want to be there. I think he's ready to give up. And since when did they need a dozen musicans on stage at any given time?
5,Excellent concert !,"Totally enthralling concert ! David Gilmour is as good as you can get! My personal favorites: ONE OF THESE DAYS, SPEAK TO ME, BREATHE, TIME, MONEY and US AND THEM are absolutely fabulous. Unfortunately, no DVD version yet. Buy this video ! You will not be disappointed !"
5,Best Concert Video Ever,"This is without a doubt the best concert video I have ever seen. It has more focus on the light show than individual members of the band, but with a Pink Floyd concert that is what you want. I originally had the VHS of this show but had to have the DVD as soon as it came out after many viewings my VHS was showing wear and tear. The sound is also great on this DVD. With my 5:1 surround cranked up it is quite awesome. Do yourself a favor and don't hesitate to snatch this one up right now."
5,Pink Floyd always in a higher level!!!,Pulse is the best live music video ever made!!The sound is outstanding!The image is awesome!Pink Floyd Played in magnificent way.I just change this: I'd rather add a few more songs.Fantastic DVD!!!
4,Jaw-Dropping Concert!,"This will be rather brief and concise, but that's me.This has to be one of the best, if not the best, light and stage show I have ever seen. The shortcomings of the video quality have been noted, but I don't think they take away from the incredible effect of the lights, lasers, projection etc. The musicianship is top notch, as would be expected from the Floyd.The only critical comment I'd make is that I found the backup singers a bit distracting or too much out in front on some songs. There were moments when I was wanting to watch what the band was doing (i.e. playing) and then they'd cut to the backup singers or pop the projection footage in. I've always found that irritating in concert videos, although this wasn't anywhere near as bad as what Yes did with their 90125 concert video. I still think whoever put that one together should be strapped to a chair and made to listen to Florence Foster King records for a couple of hours."
5,WOW!!!,"I must admit that I am a huge fan of PF. But beyond that, this is a great DVD. The video is respectable on my high-def for being recorded quite a few years ago now. The audio is absolutely awesome in surround. When the helicopters were coming out of the synthesizer, my dog was looking at the ceiling trying to see where they were coming from: very realistic, great sound. Gilmore on guitar, dual synth's, the girls on backup, everything was beautiful vintage PF at their true best, and they were enjoying doing it. Unreal stage setup, effects, and oh yeah-the plane crash across the venue and the space ship that unfolds out of the ceiling. If this doesn't blow your mind, especially the last half-hour or so, there's something wrong."
4,levy's leather strap,"This strap is an oak leaf and acorn tooled leather design. It's very high quality, as all Levy's straps. This strap (36 x 50"") is 4"" shorter in max length than my other Levy's leather tooled strap (Kokopelli design, 41 x 54""). So I was a little suprised when I tried to make this one the same length, by putting the extension into the same adjustment slot, it came up 4"" shorter. That issue is easily fixed by just using a different slot. I looked at Levy's website, and indeed this one is supposed to be 4"" shorter. So if you like the guitar to hang real low, you better check the dimensions against your other straps. This one also comes in an extra large size (adds 12""). The seller should have put the dimensions, and more info in general. There was very little description."
2,Consumption had expired !,"In April of this year,I was surprised,looking at the goods received, Expiration date of this film, it was six months ago. This store(Sold by: J. Cohen Photography LLC) is trustworthy. Or more."
5,A must for managing,"This book is a must for anyone who has to manage people in an office, organization, and even on a committee. It is easy and interesting reading and a MUST to understand why the people you manage behave as they do."
3,Disappointed,"I liked the idea of a DVD based tutorial. However, while this guide does a reasonable job explaining general concepts of digital SLRs and the basics of the a100. It does a poor job explaining the specifics of the a100. A lot of times I had difficulty following along with the demonstrations because they do not explain the nuances of the menu system. I had to have the manual in one hand and the camera in the other, when trying to follow the demonstrations. In at least one instance when the presenter was explaining how to use the camera in Manual Mode ""M"", his camera was obviously set to Program Mode ""P"". I guess I'll try one of the printed guides."
3,"A mixed, milesian bag","Three of the tunes on the album are standards closely associated with Miles Davis. To further the connection, Shaw uses a Harmon mute during these numbers, and the arrangements are even reminiscent of the Davis versions. These numbers are well-performed, and Shaw is by no means carbon-copying Miles' licks, but there is an uncomfortable feeling of homage slipping into imitation. The other two numbers are in Shaw's more familiar modal mode and have more energy. The music is well-done, but not a good introduction to what Shaw was about as a musician. Try the excellent ""Stepping Stones"" or ""Live, Volume 3"" (which I like even better) first if you're looking for live Shaw."
3,Look elsewhere for better Beethoven,"Although this is a warm, lyrical reading of the Emperor concerto, Ax's performance is not something so special as to warrant purchasing this CD. Previn and the Royal Philharmonic do accompany the soloist well, but the sound is dull and muddy. There is little clarity in the orchestral playing, which does not translate well to CD.The Choral Fantasy is performed terribly. Ax gives a moving performance, but Mehta and the Philharmonic seem to be at odds with the soloist. The sound is muddy, the chorus unclear, and the overall interpretation un-inspired."
4,delight in your child's design,"started it, liked it, did not finish yet- has some good ideas for parents..some practical bits, looking for more inspiration"
1,waste of money,"I bought this for a parent group I am involved in and I can barely bring myself to finish it!!! The book has not told me anything I didn't already know. While being reminded of things one already knows can be helpful, this book also fails to be an inspirational reminder."
2,mostly worthless,"I couldn't get into this CD. I've heard some of Nancarrow's piano pieces and found them interesting, but when taken to a larger scale with an orchestra or ensemble, it sounds formless, senseless, and lazy. The piano trio is alright, but not worth getting the CD for."
2,I just didn't get it,"I read this book as there are currently over 25 reviews giving it 4 or 5 stars. However, I'm sorry, I didn't like it at all. I usually enjoy fantasy and mysticism adventures if they are bound by some parameters. But the number of times the word ""suddenly"" is used gives some indication of the meandering, rambling plot. Characters disappeared, then reappeared, and were telepathic and telekinetic but weren't who they appeared to be but then died, but were invisible...it really became tiresome. There was something in this novel that every other reviewer got that I unfortunately missed, but personally I thought that the last couple of chapters were simple terrible. Everything that I expected to happen happened. It is somewhat ironic that the actual plot and the character development were woefully lacking in imagination."
3,"Enjoyable, but...","Enjoyable fantasy, but marred by a writing style which distances the reader from the magical events being chronicled and leaves one feeling oddly cold despite the wonder. That said, I was sufficiently engaged to pick up his most recent book, ""A Trip to the Stars"", a far more mature work in a magical realist vein which I highly recommend."
4,"fun, interesting and romantic, but somehow a bit lacking","i enjoyed _veronica_ for the most part, but found the author's style a little too-straightforward. no offense to those who appreciate his style, but for me it was a little too... college essay format. i don't know. but! i thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and ideas he presented; certainly his in-depth look at the mystical things of not only NYC, but the world, made me think twice. without a doubt, anyone from or familiar with NYC will enjoy the book more than someone who is not; without having a grasp of not only the locations he speaks of, but the overall atmosphere of downtown NYC, you'll lose a little bit.overall, a nice summer read..."
4,A Trippy Love Story,"I picked up a used copy of Veronica based solely on the praise found on its cover, knowing nothing about the novel or the author. I was pleasantly surprised by the book, and can honestly say that it was like nothing I've ever read before. I do read a bit of fantasy, but Veronica is different in that the plot is grounded very firmly in New York City. It's what happens in the city to Leo, an innocent bystander who gets caught up in a whirlwind of magic and time-travel, that's the fantastic part. Though I found the novel to be innovative and the plot intriguing, I found Mr. Cristopher's writing style a bit repetitive and forced. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who might be wanting to read it, but the ending leaves one wondering what exactly happened to Veronica and Leo -- it's one of those endings I'm dying to discuss with someone else who's read the book. A fun, yet thoughtful, escape from reality."
2,predictable and tiresome,"""Veronica"" is an interesting story if you enjoy fantasy, but throughout I found myself reading through descriptions of symbols and colorful scenes only to come to the conclusion of a chapter and find what happened was exactly what I expected. The narrator gets dragged into Veronica's life, and is compelled to follow every direction she and her cohorts give him. His love for Veronica, which is supposed to be the reason he doesn't resent this compulsion, never seemed believable, so his gullibility and Veronica's domination of him were annoying rather than understandable.This book is unique, and not a complete waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it. Some surprises, as well as a stronger love story, would have improved it greatly."
2,Incredibly over-appreciated,"I'm only reviewing this book to counter what strikes me as an excessive number of positive reviews. Although there is clearly an audience for this sort of novel, I know that many people will be as utterly turned off by it as I was, but will simply forget it, and you'll never hear from them.So, if blatant artificiality, stilted, uninvolving prose and cardboard characters are your cup of tea, you may really enjoy this ""magical"" book. At any rate, I recommend going to a physical bookstore and sampling a few pages before you decide to buy it."
1,Terrible,"I am somewhat of a biased person, because the author of this book taught me a creative writing course at NYU, but I found this book to be extremely dull and trite. It deals with fantasy, myth, magic, and so on, but not nearly as well Tolikien or C.S. Lewis (and I am not even a fan of them). However, if you like surreality to the point that it diverges from any conception of 'reality' (whatever that means) then perhaps you will like this exploration into the world of myth and fantasy. If you do not thoug"
3,Not as good as....,"......A Winter's Tale, not by half! Another reviewer compared the two, and it moved me enough to write this. I'm also a fan of John Fowles, and again, this work just isn't comparable. It can be an enjoyable read if you allow it its quirks, but I do agree with those frustrated by the gratuitous symbolism, predictable plot and cardboard characters. Often times, it felt as though the author was trying to appeal to the LA set interested in a special effects movie."
5,A fantastic guidance tool!,"I reviewed this book for the Liguorian and was really impressed with it. First, I was amazed to find a Rabbi and a minister of the United Church of Christ collaborating on anything. That is so refreshing. Then, I was further shocked to find them teaching us about things like meditation. This book is destined to become a religious/spiritual classic! It offers sound and practical advice for learning to love yourself, your community, and your world. We should all read this book and apply the teachings of these two wise men."
5,Also helps with the ps2 verson,"to keep it simple it helps alot . it covers the 360, psp, and ps2. not sure of the ps3. I was able to find all the films all 100 of them easier. great buy worth it."
5,BEST BUY,"BLISS PANTS ARE COMFORTABLE. THE WAIST IS HIGH ENOUGH. IF YOU WEAR A SHORT JACKET, NO SNOW WILL GET IN WHEN YOU SLAM YOUR REAR ON THE SNOW. THE ELASTIC ON BOTTOM LEGS PREVENT SNOW FROM GETTING IT. BLISS PANTS KEEPS YOU WARM. REMEMBER NEVER WEAR JEANS UNDER SNOW APPAREL. WEAR BREATHABLE - LIKE SWEATS UNDERNEATH BLISS PANT ON VERY COLD DAYS. I LEARNED HOW TO SNOWBOARD IN MY BLISS PANTS. YOU WILL ENJOY PANTS."
5,Ooh my gosh,"I was very happy to read about the defiant one! The story captivated me,pulled at my very inside to find release towards the end !"
5,Very fun to read,This entire series is quite entertaining. I am glad I chose to read all four of them. Just wish I could meet one of those brothers! HA!
2,Not as good as the first 2,"After reading the first two books in the series,The Wild OneandBeloved One, I found this book lacking. The plot and love interest felt forced, possibly because the reason the male and female got together initially was due to a ""love potion"", or more appropriately, a lust potion. The attraction felt false and it seemed like Andrew and Celsiana got thrown together because they were the outsiders and not because they were truly into each other. The whole plot seems a bit unbelievable and after reading the first 2 books which contained much more depth and believability, I wasn't really expecting such a turn of events. I am hoping the last book,The Wicked One, turns out to be a lot like the first two in the series."
5,"Defiant, maybe not","Great read. Probably the most light hearted of the four books of the Montforte brothers, but sad also. You feel for Andrew in his social akwardness."
3,The Defiant One (The De Montforte Brothers),I loved the story line it was exciting true to historal novals. I just though there was way to much detail to the love scenes a little information goes a long way. I really felt like I was reading porn. In fact I had to skip over the love scene it was just way to much information. I like theTwilight Book Series Breaking Dawn Logo I Embroidered Sew Iron on Patches Great Gift for Dad Mom Man Womanauthor's story lines but it would be a whole lot better read if she cut the details way back on the love scenes.
4,Great Book,"This is the ultimate beach reading novel. Great characters, good plot, lots of drama. Truly is a great, and very addicting series."
4,Book order??,"Can someone/anyone please tell me how they go in which order please, I want to get them, just don't know what ones go in order? Thank you :)"
5,This is the best of books,I must say this is a great book it was wonderful and funny.Many people have complained that they have not read the first 2 and so this is confusing or such. Well I feel that this book carries it own. There is no need to read the others if you don't want to because this book tells a little about the other two.But I sugjest you do anyways because they are excellent. Ms. Harmon is an excellent writer. I have Read the wild on and the beloved one and they are both great books First the wild Lord Gareth and Juliet then the beloved Lord Charles and Amy(both women are americans) and now the defiant Lord Andrew and Lady Chelesana. it was funny from the first moment and romantic to the last. I would give this book and its brother books 8 stars if I could. I can't wait for the last book about The Wicked Duke of Blackheath. READ IT! is all I can say
2,Defiant One?,"I have to say this book disappointed me somewhat. I guess I just expected more. I found it a little hard to fall for the dark hero, Lord Andrew. Maybe I just like my heros to be a little less brooding and a little more charming. True, Celsiana livens things up a bit, but again, it was hard for me to sympathise with her. I just couldn't seem to get involved in their lives and the plot was just a little much for me to believe. I did however enjoy the scenes with Lucien, Andrew's cunning and very manipulating brother! I'd very much like to read more about him.THE DEFIANT ONE is the 3rd book in the de Montforte series, but of course, I didn't realize that when I started reading. As I haven't read the first 2 books, THE WILD ONE and THE BELOVED ONE, perhaps that would make all the difference. As it stands right now, I can't say that this is my favorate book by Danelle Harmon."
1,Doesn't Fit Earlier Books,"I read this story because I liked the other 2 books despite the poor background research by the writer. This plot was just plain stupid. Visions? Geez, why not just give him a drug habit? That would have been far more reasonable. In addition, the writer can't even follow a simple time line. While she goes through the effort to describe the deplorable road conditions of the late 1700s, the travel by her characters rarely fit this reality."
3,just OK,"The great depth was not here in this story. Celsie and Andrew didn't seem to really be in love. There love seemed forced . There was no real romance between them. The love potion, once it was through their system left them quiet, and very detached from each other. They rode all the way to london not talking at all. Other than sex they didn't have much warm feelings for each other. this story just wasn't as good as the first two. I am still hoping for The Wicked One to be a good book."
3,Not as good,It was very wordy. Without much meat in the story. Loved the female character but the male lead was a bit confusing.
5,Building an exquisite basic classical repitiore on a budget...,"This is a shining, expansive, lush, rich and powerful version of Rimsky-Korsakov's exotic and sweeping Sheherazade. The rock-bottom price makes for a great oppurtunity to build a classical repitiore on a budget.The added bonus is the wonderful Russian Easter Overture, which was my very first introduction to the colorful Russian composer. The Overture, which should be at least as popular as Tchaikovsky's hacknied 1812 Overture, is a vibrant depiction of a Russian Easter celebration with the horns and strings alluding to solemn Orthodox hymns and a finale that features church bells and percussion thundering in the ressurection of Christ. But one need not be particular religious to be swept away in the masterful orchestrations of this brief but moving tour-de-force. It meets the effect of touching deeply upon the sad and soulful Russian soul."
5,"The ""Scheherazade"" to beat!","My favorite version of ""Scheherazade"" was by Joel Pernea, but I don't think it's made it to CD. Never fear; this one is as powerful as I remember Pernea's being. Of course I haven't heard every ""Scheherazade"" out there, but this one's a little special, so go fot it."
3,scheherazade,"Although this is a good recording, it is an older performance than I had expected. Fidelity is a little less brilliant than I had hoped."
3,A great conductor going through the motions,"Every day an unknown number of new listeners is thrilled by first hearing the glittering Scheherazade, but to conductors it's as hackneyed as the 1812 Overture, unless...The ""unless"" covers a lot of ways to invigorate this warhose. Stokowski applies lush gaudiness in his three readings, which can be thrilling. Reiner gave us astonishing orchestral virtuosity from the Chicago Sym. and one of Living Stereo's best recordings, a marvel almost fifty years on. beecham delivers a fresh, buoyant readding that comes close to being joyous (though the EMI recording is dated).Temirkanov certainly has the potential to do something special with Scheherazade, but what we get instead is an all-around straighforward reading, good but not spectacular sound, and some nice expressive touches here and there. The NY Phil. doesn't sound that jazzed, either. Altogether, I had hoped for more."
4,James Galway's Flute Sings,"Galway doesn't just play the flute, he makes it sing. He plays all the notes and gives them a voice, much as a singer would do. The results touch the soul as only a voice can do. Familiar tunes take on a whole new character. I listen to Galway's Greatest Hits in my car. It makes any trip more pleasant and keeps me clam yet alert."
1,One of the most boring textbooks on the planet,"The authors (Lee Galda, et al) of this textbook took a truly exciting and important subject, which I am extremely interested in, and produced the most tedious, lackluster, monotonous, yet overly expensive volume I have ever been REQUIRED to purchase. They should be ashamed for having made sharing the love of reading with children such a mind-numbing experience for future educators. Indeed, there are not enough synonyms in the English language to convey how dull this book is. Do not purchase it unless you absolutely must, and by all means get is a cheaply as possible."
5,Very useful,"As a student, I hate buying textbooks that I hardly ever open and will never use but this book is great. So much information, graphics, charts... Not a difficult read either :)"
4,Literature and the Child,"The text book is easy to read, the books listed in the appendix are a good mix of books for all ages. The text book's information is positive and the set up is in a logical order."
4,Literature and the Child,"Great reference for teachers and parents alike. Book lists are fantastic and take the guess work out of figuring out which book is appropriate for which age as well as what genre the books fit into. The reading gets a bit tedious with too many book examples given for each topic, but it is very easy to skip over those parts and move on to the next topic. The book lists throughout the chapter list the books for each age and genre so you don't miss anything by skipping over 2-3 paragraphs."
1,I wish I received the correct product!,"Im sure this is a great book......for someone who ORDERED A 3RD EDITION!!!! However, I ordered a 6th edition....and was sent a 3rd. When I contacted the seller to resolve this matter, they simply informed me that Amazon has a tendency to put the same ISBN numbers on numerous editions of books. So, when I asked them what they were going to do about it, they simply said, ""im not sure what you are asking for, we sent what you ordered."" So, needless to say, I probably wont be doing this again!"
5,Pretty much brand new,This book came as a hard cover book with the cover intact and brand new. Got it very fast and in time for my class!
2,Not delicate,"These earrings looked beautiful in photo, but when I received them in the mail, the chain was very thick. I expected a more delicate look, but could not return them because I opened the package and it was against the return policy. They are also not the same length. When I put them side by side, I noticed one pearl hangs lower than the other...probably not noticeable when you wear them, but it still bothered me."
4,An unexpectedly fine purchase,"Canonball Adderley has so many fine CDs exhibiting his saxophone prowess but this is especially nice; an amazing version of West Side Story's ""Somewhere"" and some fine tracks with bossa nova beats too. DO buy this--a great CD for personal listening pleasure or background party music."
5,Every day,"I love this tea!!! It is amazing! I love My coffee but at some point in the day I must have this delicious, very flavorful tea. Also this is a great seller. I think I've mentioned that before but it bears repeating! Will order as long as they have it!"
1,They need to get the quality control issues solved,"Never again will I buy a top of the line palm. I have purchased two Palm Cs, and as a previous reviewer has indicated, the LCD breaks if you look at it too hard. I do not recommend this to anyone who has to rely upon it. Very dissapointed."
3,no bluetooth,no bluetooth and no stereo are reasons not to buy it. i own it and want to get rid of it. i assumed the palm sdio card would work
1,great product....when it works.,"I received this as my 40th birthday present from my wife and loved it right away. It was great until six months later when the screen went haywire. Lost the picture but had vertical lines up and down, stuck on.Palm sent me a refurbished unit that died within 2 months. Screen failed to come on.Palm sent me another refurbished unit (that was pretty beat up) but I cannot use the keyboard to enter text into a DateBook line item. The cursor jumps to top everytime. Others have had this problem as I've read on a Palm Tungsten Forum.Palm is sending me another refurbished unit. This will be my 4th and I'll sell this one and get another brand.Pretty disappointed with Palm."
1,"Lousy product, with even worse CUSTOMER support / warranty","I bought this from Amazon in Nov 04, the screen went blank on me this summer and I had to pay $125 plus handling $25 maybe, for a replacement product, DESPITE this being in the warranty. I got the replacement in August 05; the battery is now dead. Have spent an inordinate time on the phone (no toll free support at Palm - hell, no support for that matter!), to be told that replacing the battery (despite the unit they sent me being less than 4 months old and an obvious dud) would cost $200 plus handling. I've not given up on it yet, and will follow up all channels, including Amazon, FTC, Better Business Bureau and whoever else. Thought I'd alert others to this if you think of buying Palm One products."
3,Tungsten C Support!,Tungsten C is a great product when it is working but when you need support forget about it. The support number you call is not a toll-free number and they keep you on hold so long that you don't even want to bother. When you finally get a hold of someone they can hardly speak the english language. PALM SUPPORT is the worst and the next time I think about buying a new PDA I will probably get another brand. It is too bad that this company can't back the great product that they sell!!!!
4,palm tungsten c review,"I replaced a lost palm c rather than upgrade to a smart phone. I like the keyboard on the palm c and the Palm OS platform. I do not feel comfortable carrying an expensive smart phone with me when I go to the farm or work outside. I can then leave the palm in the truck or at the house and carry a cell phone in my pocket. I use the palm in my work, because i can load large healthcare drug databases, and everything revolves around the schedule/organizer."
3,DOES NOT ALLOW 2GB SDCARD!!,"I have been happily using this robust machine since it originally came out, and I have NEVER had ANY complaints UNTIL NOW.I tried to upgrade my SDCARD to a 2GB SDCARD and the Tungsten C wouldn't recognize it. Apparently, Palm will NOT release an updated driver that allows their units to read SDCARDS that are above 512MB although the machine certainly has the hardware to be capable to do so (instead they want us to shell out another few hundred dollars to buy a Tungsten TX or a new LifeDrive). The hacks that are out there DO NOT WORK (e.g. downloading LifeDrive's driver, etc.).Since most of us users are listeners of MP3s and PodCasts, this failure of Palm to release a driver (which can so easily remedy the problem) shows a sincere failure to Palm's customers most of who have been loyal customers for YEARS.If you thing that you will EVER need a card that has storage space above 512MB, then the Tungsten C is NOT for you. This is a serious disappointment."
5,"Very Fast Palm, Amazing Color Screen","This is my very first Palm. I have wanted one for years but never wanted to fork out the money. So for my birthday my wife got one for me. All I have to say is WOW! I was worried that it was going to be bulky with the built in keyboard, but that just isnt the case. It is just the right size to use and play with. The 64 megs of ram is great. Right now with my whole contact database from work, 4 games, a few other apps I'm using a grand total of 5.4Megs. If you do decide to buy this unit the first app you need to get is Net Chaser. It a WiFi scanner to look for networks. I am amazed how many networks there are out there and they are unprotected. I can walk through my apt complex and detect over 10 networks and only 3 are encrypted. This Tungsten C is well worth the money."
1,Less than HOT PDA,"I am now on my third Tungsten C and even this one is not working right. To be fair, Palm customer service has been very helpful but this device is just plain no good. I'll keep it to play solitaire but I'm now getting a pocket pc for my PDA needs."
3,Not compatable with Windows Vista,The Palm Tungsten C is not compatable with Windows Vista. they have yet to come out with software update or fix for this problem. After talking to Palm tech support it doesn't appear that they ever will or care to. The unit is great if you never upgrade to vista which Microsoft seems to be forcing on the public.
2,Not Impressed,"I was excited to find a pda with a keyboard that didnt need a phone plan (like the blackberry). I was disappointed when it took 2 days to set everything up and then even more outraged that I needed to buy additional software to get basic things (like the enhanced web-brower and games). I also found the battery life to be poor and was disappointed when I couldn't check email from hotmail/yahoo accounts. In addition, the Wi-Fi hotspots aren't as common as one might think (even in NYC), so email and web browsing wasn't accessible most of the time. I wouldn't have minded paying the $500 if its features functioned with ease.Some of the good features: powerpoint, word, excel and the ability to open attachments (was not an option with the older blackberry models), great screen and resolution, small size, and user friendly keyboard.I recommend one of the newer blackberry's if you are a keyboard person and like that functionality."
3,Pain at the end of the tunnel,"You need to learn to do a workout with your thumbs if you are going to be able to enter your messsages in a rapid manner. Otherwise, you end up using the electronic keyboard, which defeats the purpose of buying a Tungsten C. The missing componenst for me are Bluetooth and the Voice recorder, both available on the Tungsten T. The advantages are the WiFi and the increased memory.I haven't used the Wi-Fi yet, but I miss the recorder and Bluetooth. As I use the C more in the next monrth, I'll write an update.Nancy"
4,A PDA worth your while,"When I aquired this PDA two years ago, I was a total newbiewhere gadgets are concerned and this is my experience in allthis time that I've had it.First, the fact that you have 802.11 connectivity is a realplus. You usually don't want to carry around a laptop ora similar item, some specific websites (not all because ofthe browser's incapability to show popups and other typicalweb features) can be seen, and all of the infrared goods area plus when used with your favorite IRDA enabled cellphone.Second you have a color and a more decent resolution than ofthe usual PDA's. This gives the Tungsten C a display that canhelp pictures show in a more proper fashion. You get an emailprogram that has its limitations, but useful otherwise.Finally, the only two drawbacks I found is that you need to 'upgrade to a more recent version of the PalmOS and the batteryafter some time does not give all the time advertised. Overall,the product is good and will be of great use once you have it."
4,"Nice, but worth the price?","Work provided me with a T-Mobile Smartphone Pocket PC. Yeah, it sounds nice, but is more of an extended leash. they are nice. but I decided to buy my own so I can load what I choose.I picked up the fanciest and most expensive on the block - The ""C"". It was nice, well built, with an impresive screen. I got it connected to my wireless (flawless effort) and started surfing. Man, the pages loaded in blazing speed. I did some yahoo checks and other foreign language lookups. it worked like a charm. I played a lot with the built-in apps for a week. I jst got my refund this afternoon.In the end, it wasn't worth the price for me. It may be for you, but the $500 snaps could be best spent on other items (my opinion). p.s. the keyboard was a nusiance."
3,"Nice, but inconvenient and expensive to upgrade software","I received my tungsten c two days ago. I followed the instruction to install the software on my win xp laptop. But I could not get the handheld to sync with my laptop. So I uninstalled everything, rebooted, and then reinstalled everything. This time around, I did a successful first sync. This palm has been a joy to have.The web browser that comes with it is version 2.0 and the docs to go v5. Palmone charges $35 to upgrade the browser to version 3.0 and $30 to upgrade docs to go to v6. In fact, most of the included software titles are not the lasted. If you would like to upgrade them, you will likely use all the rebate that you may receive weeks or even months later.I like Tungsten C. But find it inconvenient and expensive to upgrade the applications. Hence the 3 stars.It would have been much easier for user if Palmone would simply package the handheld with the latest software package and reduce the rebate."
3,Almost prefect.,"I've been through 4 of these and they have all made random speaker 'clicks' when in silent mode. Does anyone else have this problem? For this price, I can't accept a glitch like that. Other than that, it is a great device, and I really wish I could find one that worked 'silently'. If it had a built-in microphone for taking voice messages it would be perfect... except for that speaker thing."
4,A boy's life,"Stephen Fry delights his readers once again with exceptional humour and candour. More like a casual conversation than an informative autobiography, the book unravels in a curious story about a boy's life. Fry writes with the maturity of an adult but he recalls with a boy's memory, making this biography uniquely refreshing."
5,"And Let Us All Say ""Ah!"" Men","A little reminiscent of James Thurber's autobiography, ""My Life and Hard Times,"" in that the author really isn't interested in documenting every aspect of his early life so much as he is interested in examining only its more notable points. But whereas Thurber takes minute incidents and magnifies them into comic epic sagas, Fry takes his more significant moments and de-mystifies them. There are plenty of digressions along the way, and since Fry's life story is hardly singular, we are grateful for the digressions. Among my favorites are the great sensible discussions about the nature of the homosexual psyche and Fry's self-wonderment over his own criminal proclivities. My guess is, at the end of the book most readers probably utter an ""Ah!"" the same way Fry uttered it after he is caught for the last time, but ours is the satisfied ""Ah!"" of knowing that we've just spent some time in the presence of a uniquely entertaining personality."
4,Not everyone's Washpot,"A very moving account of an internationally famous actor and public intellectual's childhood and adolescence in English 'public' (i.e.private) boarding schools. The territory is largely familiar, but what marks this book off from most others is the explicit and courageous way in which Fry writes about ""growing up gay"". He also uses some very explicit language, but very little that is gratuitous. It will be of great comfort to every adolescent who ever felt ""odd"" or not a member of the ""in-crowd"". The comfort lies in Fry's honesty about his sexuality, and that he never allowed this to cripple his growth to what D H Lawrence once called ""spontaneous creative fullness of being"". Though parents may raise eyebrows or objections to some of the content, this is a profoundly warm, human and healing book."
5,best autobiography ever,"As a long-time admirer (adorer, really) of Mr. Fry's, I have read his autobiography more times that I can remember. It reads like an enthralling work of fiction (comedy in many parts) without being at all sensationalist or self-serving.Apart from the tender and eloquent portrayal of Stephen's first love ""Matthew"", this autobiography offers a first-hand glimpse into the world of English boarding schools, fagging, rugger practice, beatings, etc; a mysterious world which most of its readers never experienced --for better or worse-- due to gender, age or location. A thoroughly delicious read from start to finish."
5,[insert cryptic title here],"Stephen Fry recounts his childhood and teenage years with honesty and candor. Whenever I read an autobiography I'm prepared for some bias and self-absorption, but Fry's book seems to be a sincere attempt to be candid and reflect upon his past. The autobiography feels relatively uncensored as he writes about mischief at boarding school, unrequited love, making use of a stolen credit card, and a suicide attempt during his teenage years. It's all presented with humor and little, if any, self-aggrandizement. I finished the book feeling as though I had read his carefully thought-out musings and insights on life and certain topics in general, rather than simply a retelling of the events that had occurred his own life."
5,"Stiff upper . . . oh, ah?","This is yet more proof as to why the British are so bloody entertaining: what other race could produce such civilized misbehaviour as Stephen Fry's? His candor and wry self-examination in these lolloping, no-punches-pulled pages boggle the mind. And they touch the heart, too. Fry is a master at presenting the misadventures one falls into when you're a big soul cooped up in a small world. There's plenty of shock value in this tale of boarding schools, petty thefts, a rotten mole, and inappropriately used lavatories, but then again, if coming of age wasn't a shock to you, you haven't done it properly. Carry on, Fry."
4,A must for all Fry and Laurie fans!,"If you are a fan of Stephen Fry and you want to know more about the man behind the comedy, this is a great read. I couldn't put it down. I really admire the work of Stephen Fry and after reading his wonderful work of fiction ""Making History"", I knew his autobiography would be a fascinating ride down his memory's lane. Mr Fry's ""Moab is My Washpot"" looks back upon his formative years from infancy to university days. I loved his tales of his primary and high school days. I could just picture a young mischevious Stephen up to no good. I admired his openness in sharing the dilemmas and confusion of his growing awareness of his homosexuality. I recommend this book most highly. It is witty, honest, candid and ...for want of a better word ... moving."
2,Interesting Insight; But Way Too Much Info,"I lovedFry: A Memoir, so thought I'd find out about the first 20 years of Fry's life. It's fascinating to see how troubled he was as a child, and how much he turned his life around. Parents, teachers, and those with sensitive stomachs should be warned that Fry leaves no details out of his account of his sexual development and early sexual experiences (including one rather worrying and not entirely consensual one with an older student at school). For those interested in Stephen Fry I would recommendFry: A Memoir, but even that only to those 18+ on account of some very explicit sexual references. Despite these, a highly entertaining and intriguing read. DEFINITELY listen to the audiobooks rather than the books if you're going to read them, Fry's narration transforms them."
4,great book--terrible typos,"I just finished this book last night and think that Stephen Fry is a genius. I loved it. I must say, though, that there were so many typos, spacing, and punctuation errors that I am hesitant to ever buy a Kindle book again. Shame on the people who created the electronic version, and shame on Amazon for asking money for this inept version of an e-book."
3,Moab is My Washpot,"Funny...wished for a little more, great growing up tale and funny British witticisms. Life at boarding school and early attractions."
5,"writing vivacious, dialogue witty","yes, this is really a wonderful memoir I had ever read. you can read all comments from the site, what I can say is that writing is wonderful, it's vivacious, don't forget to appreciate the dialogue--you cannot find it at another book."
5,Don't read it in public - people will stare!!,"After picking this up on a business trip in Manchester, I had to stop reading it while in public - I was either laughing out loud or softly crying during this incredible story. Only Fry could have this outrageous life! I cannot wait for the tale about his next 20 years.An absolute must read book for anyone who has enjoyed any of his other works, written or performance!"
4,Fry is a great summer read!,"I read the English paperback of this book and I found it a riot! I really love Fry as Jeeves so I was very interested in who this guy was! Well he is a wonderful writer as well as a fine actor. This is a good summer read! However, I read it during my winter vacation. I loved every minute of it. Enjoy!"
4,"Warm and Funny, a purge for the author",Fry manages to catch the difficulties of growing up in the English public school system. He discribes how he comes to terms with his sexuality in a very touching style. A compelling read which clearly served to clear many ghosts from Mr Fry's now empty closet.
3,Not his best work,"I think Stephen Fry is wonderfully talented-- as an actor and a writer. I very much enjoyed The Liar and Making History, two of his fictional forays. MOAB seemed disjointed, haphazzard... I believe that SF must have a very interesting life & life history, but this book did not express it. Was this written to fufill a contractual obligation? His heart just did not seem to be in it. Quite a shame."
3,Difficult to put down.,"Self indulgent, often like a prolonged therapy session with an unbelievably spoiled ten year old and difficult to put down. After I read this autobiography I noticed with real surprise that I had also read Hippopotamus, The Liar and Making History, and had probably read each in one sitting. It was the same surprise I got when I realized one day I had read virtually every word by P.G. Woodhouse. Fry shares with him an easy style and the not insignificant ability to tell a story. The only comedic elements missing are bite and edge. Fry needs to eliminate the ""mea culpas"" and begin lashing out more. Apparently, his first forty years were all he could hope for and more. From a reader's selfish perspective, I can only hope his life turns bitter."
4,"not bad, but . . .","Most of this autobiography was quite enjoyable. Stephen Fry is clearly a gifted writer, and based on this book I might try some of his fiction. However, a great deal of the middle of this book, say 100 pages or more, are devoted to his explaining and defending and preaching on his homosexuality.While I certainly don't begrudge him his right to tell his own story the way he wants and to spend time on what he finds important, this section really dragged on far too long. Aside from this, his story is really quite interesting and provocative. Go ahead and read it."
3,Not so much...,"I saw this guy on Graham Norton's show and thought he was hilarious. Not so much the book. It was an OK read but didn't elicit more than a minor he he while reading. It really is an autobiography and, while his life is interesting, it's not that funny. If you're looking for belly laughts, this isn't the book for you."
1,Moab is My Washpot,This is a silly book about a very shallow person who tries to be humorous but doesn't quite make it. It is disapointing as his first mystery was very good.
4,Really enjoyed it,"You can hear Stephen Fry's voice right throughout the book and although I had to resort to a dictionary a couple of times, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole ride. I'll be looking for more by Stephen."
4,I hope this helps!,I was told about this book at a workshop. It looks great! It is a good book to use at the beginning of the school year because it gives students a chance to build up their writing ego! :-)
4,Listen to it again,"I've had this cd for several months now, and when I first listened to it, I wasn't digging it. Like other reviewers, I thought a lot of the songs sounded the same and kind of boring. But, knowing that I was going to an upcoming Train concert, I kept listening to figure out some of the lyrics. Then, the strangest thing happened -- the more I listened, the more I liked it. The lyrics are smart, well-written and entertaining. Bottom line -- if you listened and didn't like it the first time, do yourself a favor and run through it a couple more times. You'll probably like what you hear."
4,Not as good as Drop of Jupiter but still a great cd.,"I didn't think this cd was as good as drops of Jupiter but, as one reviewer said give it a few more goes and you will see it really isn't that bad of a cd."
2,"Can't Sleep, play this.","Can't sleep put this album on, as it plays you will have a hard time telling when one song ends and another begins. Except for the words to the songs the music sounded about the same. Better to download Train's hits from a service then pay full price for this CD."
3,Don't know the whole story behind TRAIN...,"Train are a strange band...really they are my favourite...or were. but now, I don't know. This album is ok, the songs are good in theory...yet it just doesn't catch me! There is no emotiona connection like there was with Drops of Jupiter and their self titled. The best tracks are Cab, Explanation, All I Hear and I'm not Waiting in Line."
2,Cure for insomnia,"After the excellent sophomore CD Drops of Jupiter, Train became one of those bands whose CD's I automatically purchased upon their release. After this dreary mess, they are now off the list.I agree with all the reviewers who say that the whole thing sounds like one long mellow song. I can not tell one track from the next. If you like the single ""Cab"" than buy the CD as there are another half dozen tracks that sound exactly like it.The exception is the second track ""Get Out"". It is the one rocker on the entire disc.Two stars only because they are Train and not garbage like Stained."
3,For Me It's You,"Good CD, I basically bought it for one song (Cab), and it's great, the rest of the CD is OK."
3,"""For Me It's You"" is nice, average","This CD is pleasant to listen to but lacks originality in that the songs sound very similar to each other. There are a couple of very pretty songs, though, that stand out. It's a little too ""pop"" for my taste. I'll listen to it occasionally, but it didn't knock my socks off."
2,One long boring song...,"I was never a huge Train fan, but I did enjoy some of their older CDs. The songs had a good blues/rock sound with witty lyrics. This CD lost all of that. The blues sound is gone. The wordy lyrics are gone. All of the songs sound the same and run together. The lyrics aren't something that catch your attention even if they are not witty either. The CD is basically background music because your mind definitely won't be focusing on the music while it's playing.Some people mentioned that this CD has a Coldplay sound. I can not hear that at all. Coldplay's sound is far superior to this CD's sound. The sound of this CD reminds me a lot of some of Paul McCartney's inferior indepentent work."
2,Not their best,"This album does eventually grow on you but it's not my favorite and I hardly listen to it. Lead singer Pat Monahan is in the wrong pitch range for pretty much every song, making it really hard to listen to the whole album in one sitting. Better to stay with 'Drops of Jupiter' and not think about the akward direction Train has gone."
2,Not for all cats!!,"I thought this fish oil would be a great supplement for my cats after one of them began to overgroom and created bald patches on her stomach and legs. All four of my cats refused any type of food with this fish oil added. I tried for many days in many ways. Finally switched back from a newer dry food I thought would be better for them, back to their old dry food, which obviously had more oils in the ingredients. Bald cat is getting her fur back."
5,Does the job,"We purchased this to help with our cat's inflammatory bladder issues. She receives one capsule a day (break the tail off the capsule and pour the contents into a spoon, then syringe feed the contents into the cat's mouth, like you would with medicine). She hasn't had an episode since she's been on it."
2,Not a hit with my cats,"None of my 3 cats like this, and I've tried to administer it in/on different of their foods but they snub it."
1,Would not buy again,"This was a disaster. The dogs would not eat the capsules. When I tried to open and put on food, the oil squirted everywhere. I returned."
5,A Star Rising,"Katy Klein comes to us in full realization. Karen Irving does a bang-up job in making her characters come alive. She paints vivid word pictures and never lets us forget we're hanging on in a mystery that moves. From the first unsettling line to its climax, PLUTO RISING will keep you turning pages. Astrologer Katy Klein takes on a client and when something deep inside warns her to beware, it's too late. She's trapped by an unwise choice. The client is not who he appears to be but that's only the beginning. As Katy is drawn into the mysterious man's life, it affects her whole existence. When her daughter is sucked in, things look dark indeed.Don't read this one late at night when you're alone. If you do, keep checking the doors and windows."
4,Chiller Thriller until the end,"Six Dark Knights is basically about a down on her luck detective named Norah Gardner. She finds it difficult to deal with pressure she receives from her Chief of Police at the same time while dealing with personal issues. Once a serial killer begins murdering victims, she is then placed under extreme pressure to find the killer before he kills again.I was surprised by this novel. It wasn't at all what I expected. It was serious but the character, Norah Gardner made the book actually fun. The further I got into the novel, the more interesting it became and by the time I got to the end, it completely caught me off guard.I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a great detective novel. I look forward to the sequel to see what happens between Norah and the love of her life, Paul."
2,"Should be renamed to ""An introduction the Austrian Philosophy""","If the reader expects a short and understandable introduction to Austrian Economics (like I was), he or she will be disappointed.The book is in no way easily understandable, and contains mostly introductions to the philosophical and methodological side (Praxeology) of the Austrian school. Not so much on the real economics side of the school.However the book introduces a good introduction to some of the great Austrians and their thoughts.If the reader is looking for a better introduction to Austrian Economics I would recommend:""Lessons for the young economist"" or ""How an economy grows and why it crashes"""
2,Excellent DVD; Product Flawed on Sellers Side,"I think this is an excellent DVD! 4 of my kids (1-9 years) love to join in. However, it does not play on anything but my windows computer...not dvd and not Mac. This is inconvenient and frustrating to say the least. I will not be purchasing from this site, oddbanana, again!!!"
3,Not what I expected from a romance novel!,"This book made for interesting reading. It was hard to get into at first, but picked up quickly. I was very disappointed to see that the main character, while pregnant, continued to consume coffee and alcoholic beverages, not seeming to care about her unborn child. I checked the publishing date to see if it was a reprint from something from the past. The ending was not at all what I expected... it surprised me. This book was okay but not the greatest I've read."
3,surprises,"This book was full of surprises. Everyone and everything somehow were related. Full of cliches. But the surprise was that it was not a bad book, pretty interesting love angles."
2,not to my liking,"If you like incest, multiple adulteries, multiple casual sex couples, senior sex, recreational sex, you will love this book. this is quite a different Barbara Bickmore from her historical novels."
2,No Guide Not better than the original,My parish just started using this book we have been usingChristian Prayer: The Liturgy of the Hoursfor as long as I can remember. This new book does not compare. It does not have of what I find special and up lifting from Christian prayer. Some say pray without ceasing is easier to follow I disagree. Pray without ceasing does a horrible job. I also feel that it should not be a substitute for the liturgy of the hours. I would not recommend this book.
5,A Much Needed Service,"This first rate book not only provides authoritative guidance on household services, it also provides very practical and informative advise on how to deal with the service providers and scope out the jobs involved. To have a rating for all relevant aspects of a renovation/price, quality and reliability, makes this effort very instructive.This is truly a welcome compendium for New York City dwellers."
5,A Homeowner's (or Apartment Owner's) Best Friend,"An incredibly valuable resource--like the Zagat's of home services. This book pulls together a wealth of information about all kinds of home service people in the NYC area--from architects to exterminators. As a new homeowner, it has saved me hours and hours of searching and compiling my own information--it's all organized here in this well-designed and user-friendly book. I've already found a few leads for an electrician, and I plan to use this book as my ultimate guide for home renovation. A brilliant concept!"
5,"Bulova Quality, low price",I can not believe the low price on a watch of this quality. Comparable to a much more expensive watch. Great buy.
1,Worst book I ever read,"I read this book in the hopes of learning what made Danielle Steel such a successful writer. I was looking forward to romance, Parisian atmosphere, tension, soap opera...Blech. This was the worst book I ever read. This author is wasting precious trees, nay forests! Don't buy this book!!! There is nothing redeeming about it."
2,Too short and not in-depth enough for me!!!!!,"Five days in paris was a short, sappy book. Even a ten year old could read this in a day! I was disappointed with this one. Sort of reminds me of Special Delivery. Not her best, but not her worst."
4,Challenge and Betrayal,"DS has done it again. I totally enjoyed this book and would recommend it, especially for a day at the beach or the mountain cabin. Curl up and get ready for a wonderful novel. I loved remembering timeless Paris. This is one of Ms. Steels best works."
1,DOWN TIME!,"Well! This is a first for me... I have never read a bad Danielle Steel book before... This book was very slow and not very intriguig or anything really... I read it but it never spoke to me as her other books all did.. I found this book very boring and not well written... Sorry Mrs. Steel, it is the only book you ever wrote I didn't like..."
5,Great Romance,Five Days In Paris is probably going to be my favorite Danielle Steel novel.The story was simple and predictable but yet it was captivating in the sense that it provides hope especially to those who are stuck in loveless marriages and mundane lives.The romance between the main characters - Peter and Olivia - is definitely memorable and worth hoping for.Give this novel a try if you want to read about a great love story.
4,Five Days in Paris,"The book was fresh and sweet. Danielle Steel writes easy books to read, so one can easily get into them and interesting enough to stay captivated."
3,I was disappointed,"Of all the Danielle Steel novels I have read, this just left me flat. I was sorry it ended so abruptly. Not Happy."
3,Too short and not sweet enough,"I am a Steel fan, however this was, at best, half a book. I read it in one afternoon. The story is good, I just wish it was better developed. The leading character was believable, and like many people, caught in a peaceful but unfulfilling relationship, and then finds his true love while on a business trip. It's a light read, but don't not if you're expecting to come across your next literary masterpiece."
2,A lackluster story,"I am not typically a Danielle Steele fan, but I thought I would try something new and on CD to pass the time at work. The story was just not my cup of tea. It centered around a man named Peter who lived a life where I think you could say he was satisfied, but not necessarily happy. The book wanted you to believe that he had compromised with his wife and her family throughout their marriage, but I never really bought that. He went on a business trip where he meets someone whose more legitimately in a lonely marriage and within a few days of knowing each other, they fall in love. The rest of the book deals with how that love affair affected them long term.For me, this story just didn't do it."
2,Not her best work,"I was very disappointed with this book. Danielle Steel's books seems to have less depth to them as each one is published. I didn't get totally involved in the book and want to learn more about the people in it as I usually do with her books. Usually, I don't want one of her books to end because I want to keep reading about the characters' lives, but this one didn't fall into that category! Of course, true Steel fans have to read all of her books no matter what! I do!"
2,I had such a difficult time getting through this book.,"I love Danielle Steel, but it took me quite awhile to get through this book. It was not an enjoyable read as many of her other books. I have read many many of her books and this was one of only 2 that I would not give a 4 or 5 star."
2,only so-so,I used to read Danielle alot until it seemed like her stories were just cookie cutter versions of the previous book. So I stopped reading her. I picked up and read this book hoping that things had changed and I find they really haven't. I enjoyed reading this book but by the end I was getting impatient for it all to end. It seems like the same plot over and over with just different names thrown in. At least this one wasn't set in San Francisco!
3,Mildly Entertaining,"It was not the worst Steel that I have read, but definitely not the best, either. The one word that would describe it is Predictable."
2,This is not Danielle Steels' best work!!!,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Having been an avid fan of the author, I expected much, much more from her. She never really developed the characters, rather she skimmed the surface, not making it possible for the reader to develop any connection with these people. I'm glad I picked this book up in paperback, and didn't pay for the more expensive hardcover edition. I think that it is very obvious in ""Five Days In Paris"", that this is Danielles' 36th book. If you have enjoyed her books in the past, you will be unpleasantly surprised with this one. I just could not get into this book at all."
5,Very Romantic,"The two main people that met by accident in Paris led two different, by unhappy married lives. His was with a wife that dedicated all her time to her father, who mulitated him in the business world for an unready drug by the FDA for cancer. Hers was a political husband that didn't have time for her seeking the office of President of the US. They met by chance during a bomb scare at the hotel in Paris where they evacuated everyone and the rest you'll have to read.As usual Danielle made the book very, very interesting."
4,Good value,"These are a good value and have held up for use by my daughter in school, she loves using them."
4,Very Entertaining WWII type fiction,"A captivating WWII fiction book that plays through till about 2/3 of the way through. At this point, the author decides to omit the war years and then continue the story which breaks the continuity. Otherwise it's good character development with an extremely original plot that is packed with action!"
3,Nazi cornball,"I finished reading ""Ice Reich"" - I really don't know why. I guess I kept thinking it was going to get better and it didn't.I understand that this fiction story is based on a kernel of truth - a Nazi expedition really did go to Antartica in 1938-39. But this story is disjointed, implausible, the dialogue is so stilted I want to slap the words out of their mouths. And an American, even if he was of German ancestry, working for the Nazis? Sorry - didn't like that either, even if it was before the official beginning of WWII.I read another of Dietrich's book about Antartica -Dark Winter- and thoroughly enjoyed it. A great book."
1,SUB-ZERO,"I had high hopes... very high. I'm always on the look out and in the mood for adventures, thrillers, and any good book with Nazi's in it. And it was with high hopes I picked up and read ICE REICH... this was perhaps on of the worst, most frustrating, poorly written, plotted and slowest moving story I have ever read. Painful... by the time I had polished off the last page I simply didn't want to look at the book any more and tore it in half and dropped it in the trash. Terrible..."
2,disappointed,"This was my least favorite of Dietrich's books. Slow moving and predicable, not near as engaging and fun as the Nathan Gage series"
2,Disappointing,"No, no, no. This is NOT a rousing adventure: it's a good, quick read that ends of going flat real fast half-way through. It starts off entertaining enough - even a jovial, skirt-chasing Herrmann Goering makes an appearance - and the first expedition to Antartica keeps your interest. But then it's as if the author was under a rush to finish it, because it devolves into this strained romance that tries to be Hemingway. By the last fifty pages I was plowing through it just to be done with it. Such a shame: now Nazi UFOs in Antartica - that would be a story!"
2,No Pulitzer This Time,"The Ice Reich began with enough subtle intrigue to convince the reader that maybe, just maybe, Dietrich had created a good pot boiler of a WWII novel. Unfortunately by page 100, all has been lost. The authors biggest road block seems to be his tin ear for dialogue - mostly between the male and female lead. His heavy use of melodrama is overbearing. The time period is ripe with fasinating characters, but Dietrich chooses to go with the stock Nazi's who's only purpose is to ""defend the reich"" at all costs. Final act borders on preposterous. There is a scene in the sub where the male and female lead make love while being depth charged. It is about the corniest thing ever laid to parer. Skip this one for a good Jack Higgins - ""Eagle Has Landed"" or ""Night Of The Fox""."
2,poor idea for a plot,"saw the ad for the book in ""Time"" and since i am a WW II history student, i bought it. Should have saved my dime. i was not interested in the work at all and found the premise of the story uninteresting. something like ;the story could have happened but there are so many other stories from the war that would have been more interesting and riveting. I don't thnk the scientific minds of the times would have been as intereste in the theory of the discovery as the author wouldhave us believe. i was disapponted with the book."
4,Low budget fun that delivers,"Not exactly profound, but it is fun. Hot looking girls and senseless violence. The guy who does the dogman act is actually very good. This movie also features a skinny dip scene in one of the grossest bodies of water I've ever seen, and I'm a fisherman from NJ.There is a bonus scene that is included in the extras section that features a shoe store that I wish had been in the movie. It really would have added a cool and creepy element."
2,Not Bad,Its not bad..but not good as well...so if i have known..i would not have bought it...i was fooled by the rating at amazon!!
4,Realy Good jacket to buy,"The Product is very good for the price you pay. It is made from soft cloth and warm enough to keep you going in the winter.I am using it during the winter, I have not yet tested it in rains."
5,More than I expected,"I got this jacket to use as a winter hiking beater jacket because it was on sale. It keeps me warm, looks good, feels comfortable, and takes the beating I have dished out with no problem. I really like this jacket for hiking because it has several inside pockets, and they all can be secured closed somehow so my stuff doesn't fall out. The jacket has stood up to rain, wind, snow, rocks, thorns, sticks, branches, and barbed wire without a tear. Your actual mileage may vary, but I haven't ruined this thing yet. I do have to admit that if you held me down and forced me to say something bad about this jacket I would admit that the pocket that it calls a cell phone pocket is a bit too small, not a problem for me, I just put the phone in another pocket as the jacket has 3 more inside pockets."
1,Dont waste your money on this one,This jacket is cheaply made and doesnt look good at all. Also the size is smaller than usual sizes. I am returning mine.
3,Good Cheap Jacket,"I kept this jacket for a while, and it was very comfortable except for the elastic band seemed to be too high."
3,Good and Bad,"Good:* Comfortable and weather proof jacket* Soft and warmingBad:* Look - color, at times I feel like wearing a shaggy dress. The color is so dull that it will look like you are wearing a very old jacket. Even my first wear was like that.* Size, I somehow felt that the fit doesnt seem to be standard. Mine was little bigger for a 'L' even though other 'L' jackets are perfect for me.I used it during a snow outing and found very warming. Overall, it has been a nice performance but for the color. If you want a cheap snow outfit, go for it. If you are looking for good looking jacket, then this is not the one."
5,Amazon's Incredible Value,"The jacket is an incredible value! Quality, comfortable and cozy best describe the how the jacket feels and wears. I wish they were still available...I would buy several more for my brothers and dad. The shipping was extremely prompt, to my surprise the jacket arrived several days before the scheduled date. This is one of those exclusive deals that has made Amazon the high caliber e-retailer that it is today. Thank you Amazon!!!"
2,Am I the unlucky one?,I bought this piece after reading positive reviews but when I received the jacket it was disappointment. Stitches were coming out and it looked as if the item was old and used. Returned it immediately.
1,A cheap outerware,"I got it today from Amazon, it seems like it has been in storage room for a long long time, two buttons are broken already, size if smaller than normal, compare to my Columbia outware, it just one size smaller. I am going to return it tomorrow."
5,Marvalous Absolutely Marvalous,I loveed the book really good I have read 25 other GooseBumps books and I really love all of them and I am still reading more R.L Stine keep up the good work :) :)
2,Boring,"This book is dull compared to the first book in the series, ""AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis"". The authors take a reactive instead of proactive approach to project management. Read the four page antipattern synopsis in appendix B. The rest of the book regurgitates these items in expanded form. The text concentrates on project management problems and offers little in the solutions section. The antipattern named ""standards"" was helpful, however the material was duplicated from James Moore's book ""Software Engineering Standards: A User's Roadmap""."
2,boring and without information,"This is the second book on Antipatterns I have read (Brown was also an author in another in the same ""subject""). I think that the first one was much better (style, explanations, usefulness,etc.). This book does not add information if you compare with the first one."
1,Sounds like a great idea but....,"This program didn't work even once for me. It took 5 trips to the help website just to get it loaded as it would freeze my computer at startup. Then after it was loaded my computer was very unstable and wouldn't let me access the web most of the time. The help website is very polite but just recommends different ""fixes"" based on how your complaint fits into a algorithm. ..."
1,Terrible Product,"On a new Dell running Microsoft XP, it caused the computer to hang. I did a re-install of the operating system and loaded McAfee again. Same problem. The product just doesn't work and the online ""help"" is useless."
1,Transform your new P4 into a 286,"Just like their utilities package I bought about 3 years ago,this product literally brings your pc to it's knees!I have used Norton utilities, norton anti virus and norton systemworks 2001 through 2003.Norton has never messed up any of my systems like mcafee has.The latest norton systemworks 2003 professional and the norton internet security 2003 integrate seamlessly.I would go with norton for both utilities, internet security and anti-virus.Mcafee's virus scan works, but the rest leaves MUCH to be desired!"
1,Two thumbs down.......1/2 a star.........,"This is the second Mcafee ""bundle"" of software utilities that I bought and which did not work. Made things worse!My biggest complaint is that you can't really determine how good or bad this product really is, due to the fact that it SUCKS THE LIFE right out of your pc.My P4-2.2Ghz appeared to be locked up, but the mouse still moved.Bringing up TASK MGR I was able to kill off the Mcafee processes and regain control of my pc. In fact, the cpu processing usage dropped from 100% down to 20 or 30%, as soon as the mcafee processes were stopped.I recommend either Norton Systemworks 2003 Pro or else V-com Systemsuite 5.0. Both a very similar in functioning and features. I have used both Norton systemworks andV-com Systemsuite and both work great, detect/remove virus', defrag and repair drive problems.Note:Systemsuite 5 gives you a firewall, whereas Norton systemworks 2003 pro does not. For Norton's firewall, you must buy anothere package."
3,Luv2Bake,"I was really looking forward to this book, so when I received it I couldn't wait to check it out. It did not meet my expectations. There are some really good recipes, but most are just okay."
4,Lovely Ideas,"I bought this book expecting something different then when it was. I had bought a Disney party planner a few years back and most of the recipes in this book are close to or are exactly the same as the one in the other book. The ideas are cute, and would be great for little kid's birthday parties. The recipes are also in a wierd order, they group them together by movie, and not by type, i.e. the cakes are all in different places depending on what movie it's themed from. Some of the ideas may be to complicated if children want to help, but everything is managable. The Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast ideas are perfect for young girl parties, and The Lion King ideas are adorable. On the other hand the photographs are lovely."
4,Kids Kitchen,This is a delightfol book well presented with creative recipies which will be fun for children. Most recipies are suitable for older children 12+ or younger with parent help.Each recipe has a photo and there are lots of Disney characters throughout. Enjoy!
3,"Not bad, but could be better.","I would have to say that the Canadian gentleman who blasted this book is a bit harsh. The buyer should take note that this book is a DICTIONARY, not an encyclopedia. The definitions are of the quality you would expect from Wiley, they are concise yet informative enough to get the general meaning of what the term being defined is. My biggest gripe is that I bought this book to take the Civil PE exam, and each time I opened it during the exam, the term I was looking for was not listed in the book, rendering it useless. I was disappointed with the book because of this, and would have to say it is not comprehensive enough if you're using it for the PE exam. (I'd have to say that more ""technical"" terms are not included, only general concepts in design and construction.) Bottom line: a good supplement to an engineering library for information outside of your field of practice, but not a definitive, comprehensive text."
4,Sure Beats the Manual Type of Caulk Gun,"I decided to try a powered caulk gun because I just was not able to operate the old manual type and get a neat job. This unit is much easier to use but it does take some time to master it. It is not a powerhouse, being powered by batteries only, but it has adequate power to lay down a continuous bead of caulk. The trick is to learn the proper pressure to use on the trigger and getting in the correct position so you can see what you are doing. I am not able to compare this unit with any other powered unit since I have not used any others but it does beat the old manual typel."
3,what they said.....,"nope, not commercial grade.nope, won't handle thicker sealant.yup, saving the carpal tunnel DIYers.mama likes"
5,Works as Advertised,"I have five windows,64X59, facing a lake that I caulk with Seal and Peel every year. I don't look forward to it because squeezing a caulking gun is getting difficult. I saw this product and it looked good, so I tried it. The caulking went effortlessly and the batteries are still going strong. I'm looking for other things to caulk."
2,Not up to the task,"This unit comes with McNair batteries. Need I say more? Once I changed them to Everready, the unit bogged completely down on some admittedly thick caulk. With a new tube of smoother caulk in place, the unit managed to nudge caulk out of the tip but did so in a cyclic pattern as the little motor struggled in cycles. Smooth continous delivery was the one thing I thought I could expect from a motorized gun. Cyclic blobs I can create for myself with a hand powered caulk gun. If Black & Decker had made this corded maybe the motot could handle it but all-in-all I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,OK But No Cigar,"This product is great in concept and price, but falls short in application. To push the caulk out through the nozzle so much force is applied that fairly quickly the bracket holding the caulk tube is forced out of its holder and you have to stop and reattach it.Other than this one defect, that does not make the product unusable, it works fine."
3,Light Duty,This is OK if you want to do some very light work. It does not have much power. Better products are available.
2,powered caulk gun,"bought gun so wife could apply adhesive to glass tile project, not enough power to get adhesive out of tube, tried with liquid nails, not enough power, worked OK with thinner caulks, would not buy again."
2,Not So Great,"I purchased this in hopes it would be a help, but if I had it to do over again I would just purchase a manual caulk gun. This item is just not worth the money."
1,not what i ordered,"this is a cheap gun, i ordered an electric gun i was sent this cheap ,battered ppowered thing, very small batteries, i add,i paid price for a better one ,got this, i have kept it, cost more than it was wroth to send it back, it is no good,not good enough for 1 star,"
4,black &decker caulk gun,i couldn't find one around here so when i order that one it was my frist time doing something like that on the web. it was here before i could hardly believe it and my husband open it and used it right away. both him and i have had surgery on our hands and need something easy to used which this is and will be used a lot thanks
2,"A cauking gun powered by four standard ""AA"" batteries","Nice idea, but unfortunately, 4 AA batteries don't cut it when it comes to power a caulking gun. Sure, caulk does eventually get out of the nozzle, but it's painfully slow.Did not really work for me."
4,"Not great, but pretty good","It works pretty well, but I find it mildly annoying that when you let off on the trigger there is a several second delay of flow when you resume. It would also be nicer if there were a variable speed based on how far you squeeze the trigger so you could slow or speed up the flow without having to stop and change the switch. I'm sure this feature would add to the cost, so based on that factor alone this tool is a good buy and beats the hand squeeze models by a mile."
3,Black & Decker CG100 Caulk Gun,"Works OK on light caulking.....nice control...on heavy caulking (Sikaflex) just does work, but way slow, and goes through batteries like crazy"
2,B & D power caulk gun CG 100,The caulk gun was very weak.. on low it would not work at all and on high it worked very slow..
2,Very Slow,"This product works, but is very very slow. and eats many AA batteries. If your not in a hurry its OK. My wife laughed at me when i was using it because it was so slow. My arms got very tired holding it in almost the same position as the caulk slowly oozed out of the tip. I can't recommend it."
5,First-Rate Book -- Also known as Apraxia in US,"I actually have a copy of her first edition (which was published only in the UK). It is excellent. As a parent of a child with severe motor and oral dyspraxia/apraxia I know exactly how difficult it can be to find qualified info on this subject. Most of what you can find (which isn't much) deals with identifying it. I already know my son has this. I need to know what to do about it. This is one of the few books that deals with exactly how to ""treat"" the motor dyspraxia. If you have a child or student with dyspraxia/apraxia, get this book. When I read it I said, ""finally, a book that adequately describes my child."" By the way, this affliction is generally known as dyspraxia in the UK and as apraxia in the US. Also, there are 2 types - motor and oral, but most people will find that their afflicted child has some of both types. I hope this helps someone!"
4,Very Interesting,"I found it interesting to read about the author's journey from a divorce torn home, her addiction to food and drugs, life competing in beauty pagents and how she became a Christian, a wife and a mother."
5,"Fun, Easy, Inspiring Read","The author shares her testimony through anecdotes. Some of her stories are very painful, others are hilarious, but always she is pointing one to the power of God to change lives. The book is a good model for sharing one's faith. The author demonstrates how to share and connect one's life stories with the amazing personal transformation available through a relationship with Jesus Christ. The end of the book contains a prayer and invitation to accept Jesus as personal Lord and Savior."
1,Did I tell you that I was Mrs. United States...,"This book claims to be a spiritual, self help book. However, I found it to be an autobiography, beginning after she won the Mrs. United States title. She says that that the title gave her the platform to spead God's word, but she never speaks of any good works that she performs other than preaching to others. An average chapter would be... First let me tell you that I was Mrs. United States. I met two boys in the foster care program. I was afraid of them, they smelled awful and didn't have the talent to be in my production, but I let them work back stage and I preached to them and now they are Christians. By the way, did I tell you that I was Mrs. United States.Too many times she belittled the people that she was preaching to. The only message that I got from the book was; Do as I say and not as I do...and never forget that I was Mrs. United States."
1,Worthless CD - Why Did They Bother?,"While this book does a good job of covering the questions and subject matter of the 34 CLEP examinations, the fact that the administration of the exam is now computer-based creates a desire for practice experience that simulates the actual test environment. Students who select this book expecting that the accompanying CD-ROM will include such simulated practice exams will be in for a major disappointment, however, because the CD contains little more than a canned orientation to the computer interface. The publishers don't help much by adding a somewhat vague description of the CD's content in the text; and on the actual CD there are menus that go through subject areas and subject exam titles, but they all lead to the same generic tutorial that has nothing to do with the subject content!! It's like you're being conned. For the 2004 edition, the College Board should make a simple choice: omit the CD (and drop the price of the book) or put real practice exams on it."
3,CLEP 2003,I found this CLEP guide to be somewhat helpful. One good point is that it prepared me for the actual test format. The CD is not very useful - it basically just shows you how to navigate the computer-based CLEP exam.
5,worth it for freebird,"I had a 45 by this band with their punkified cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's never ending anthem Freebird, so i decided to buy an album so I could hear some other things they did. This cd has some great originals like Kill the President(which is so relevant in these troubled times we live in) as well as a few other wonderfully executed covers of classics. This is one of te things going on at the same time as grunge was breaking out that got unfairly ignored. Like I said in my review of Girl Trouble's Thrillsphere, if you want to know what was ignored in washington because of how popular grunge became, this is a great place to start."
5,This is an excellent book to inspire childrens' development!,"This book replicates the exceptional environment that exists in the Kids 'N' Clay Pottery Studio. The opportunity for kids to explore their creative intelligence, problem solving capacity and social interaction skills is facilitated by the creative process as documented in this book. The book sets up the projects, learning scenarios and technical (easy) aspects of creating the same kind of nurturing child development environment in your home or classroom. HIGHLY recommended!"
5,I disagree...,"...I have been going to kids and clay since I was six. There are three things that I would like to say in response... Firstly, it is not true that 99% of kids cannot center a piece of clay. I will admit that it takes practice, but under the instruction of Kevin, I was able to center a medium piece of clay by the time I was 8. Secondly, I do not believe that Kevin's book is giving any false messeges to begin with. Everyone who comes to kids and clay, except for the really young kids, is able to center a piece of clay. It is not as hard as [they] make it sound like. And thirdly, I think that [she] should think about how many kids she has just discouraged from picking up a piece of clay..."
2,unimaginative projects,"The projects are unimaginative. The book starts with a pinch pot. Why? I have only seen a good looking pinch pot once, when shown by a professional potter.The rest of the projects are all cliches with no imagination also."
3,Great for Beginners,"This is a great book for people who really don't know anything about Clay and want to explore ceramics with their children. It gives enough background and technical information that projects can be successful, but not too much to be overwhelming. Nice very basic information about wedging clay, slab, coil and pinch techniques, and some decorative ideas.If you already know a little about clay, however, this book is not likely to add much. If you've taken ceramics in college or a community art center, save your money and just grab your kids, a hunk of clay and have some fun!As Bob Pittman at the Towson State Ceramics Department always said, ""Clay is the Way""!"
4,An interesting combination of RVW works,This exploration of Greensleaves by RVW is amusing and is well executed.Symphony no 3 is a very moving and deeply troubling work that requires concentration so as not to be overwhelmed. This recording does reflect the nature of the work and its better qualities.
5,i knew i wouldn't be disappointed...,"WICKED!! I've been waiting soooooo long for this album, i got it the day it came out! The obvious difference between their 2 albums, is that they used less live instruments in this album, but its still a brilliant album!! The production and lyrics are on point as per usual!!... Whole album is great, but my favs are DO U REMEMBER, WHERE WOULD I B, LET IT ALL GO, SNEAK A FREAK, MESSAGE TO MARVIN... Class!!"
5,Awesome...Finally Artists based on LOVE!!!,"OH my God. I have both of their CD's. the first did not get the recognition it deserved. I hope this one gets it. It is awesome. Usually when you purchase a CD there is at least one or two songs in which you dont like. NOT THIS ONE... I LOVE EVERY SONG. I am so delighted to finally hear some REAL music, Some FEEL GOOD music. I pray that they stay in love and keep bringing the awesome vibrations through their music!!!! KINDRED IS A DEFINITE MUST FOR ALL MUSIC COLLECTIONS!!!!"
5,Bliss!,"Absolutely pleased with ""Kindred"". They are consistent in their lyrics, subject matter and vocals. Their vocals are a special blend. I always feel at peace after I listen to them. It's too bad that their talent doesn't get as much attention as some of the artist in other genre's. I would buy a Kindred CD unheard. Haven't been disappointed yet."
5,Awesome couple! Great Music,"The first time I heard them? At a concert in Atlanta 03/05/06 and I thought who is that!! I bought both CD's but I think ""In this Life Together is my favorite! The other CD is awesome too they are both worth buying! If you every have a opptunity to see themin person GO!! This couple I love and I love what they share... it's real: Favorite song on this CD is ""Where would I be without you"" Not just from a relational point but I also related it to JESUS.. where would I be without him!"
5,Kindred Did It Again,This couple has grace and style unlike most entertainers today. Their love for their family and each other shines through their music. They have real talent. It's nice to see what black love should be. The world should take note of the positive energy that exudes from every song. This CD is refreshing as was the first. Continue to be an example in your music and your lives. May the Most High be always with you both. Good work.
5,A Pleasant Break from Hip-Hop,"Aja Graydon and Fatin Dantzler, the husband and wife team, also known as Kindred are back again with their Hidden Beach Recordings release ""In This Life Together."" The songs are not typical love songs, but touch on all types of relationships. In whole, the CD should attract a diverse audience. I put the CD in the player, sat back, and let it play without hitting skip. After listening to ""In This Life Together"" I plan on purchasing the first because I like their sound.If you need a break from hip-hop or pop, then this R & B album is a must have for your listening pleasure. --Shelia M Goss, BellaOnline Women in Music"
5,Firmly Wedged in the Romantic Prerequisite!!,"Just acquired this powerful, well produced album yesterday afternoon and I played it well into the morning. Well done to Hidden Beach for producing this work of art, and bringing out the excellence of their other artists. The lyrics are very, very very intense and well constructed, and the melodies out of this world. By far one of the best RnB/Soul albums released this year. If their plot was to go from a promising soul act to extraordinary revered superstars, then this duo has succeeded !!!!!!!!!"
3,Kindred's latest,"I loved the first album. The first single captured the essence of Philly soul. It was a totally enjoyable CD. This couple represents black love, and I respect that. This album was so so. I don't put it on heavy rotation. No songs stood out to me. I will have to force myself to listen to find a favorite song. It is hard to pump out multiple classic albums."
3,Much more effort the second time around,"Ok. I am not a frequent reviewer in general and seldom one on Amazon. But I thought it would be worth to describe this second effort by this group. The song ""The Question - (Where would I be)"" epitomizes neo-soul with its smooth background licks and rhythms. The words in this track as well as others give refreshed meaning to the idea of songs with meaning. Thus a purchase of this album will give the listener an opportunity to enjoy a duet - when they are so few to enjoy."
1,Waste Of Money,"I waited a year for this CD and was truly disappointed. These songs are not the original ones you heard on the radio. This is one of the reasons collectors download off the internet. At least if it's not original, it wasn't a waste of time & money. All older music should state whether it is original or not. I gave it one star for the cover!"
4,Unique for its genre,"The cover is what drew me to this book because of the dark colors and the scary looking mermaid on the back. I was not sure what to expect when I began, but I found it to be unique and imaginitive. Talking stone lions, Egyptian mummies attacking Venice and creatures from Hell-what more can one ask for in an adventure. I am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series."
4,The Mysterious world of Dark Reflections,"Not being an avid fan of fantasy I couoldnt help but pick up this book like other readers because of its unqiue artwork. I know the old adage ""never judge a book by its cover"" but in this case I took a gamble, one that paid off.Kai Meyer's weaves a tale of magic, intrigue and danger. Merle, a young orphan girl and her friend Junipa have been apprenticed to a magic mirror maker. Life is hard in their city of Venice, town filled with Magic, gondolas drawn by mermaids and beseiged by a beligerent Mummy warriors from the evil Egyptian empire.Her apprenticeship brings her in contact with mny fantastic people and starts her off on an amazing journey. She has to help her friends, learn about the mysterious Flowing Queen which protects Venice and learn about herself in the process.A great book and a quick read! Recommended!!"
2,"No more for me, thanks.","2-2.5 starsI was amused by some of the ideas mentioned in the front flap of the book: Venice under siege by the Egyptian Empire; mummy soldiers; mermaids in the canals. What's not to like? Unfortunately, most of these ideas, and the other interesting ones brought up in the book, are never really explored. This entire book seems to serve the purpose of setting up the rest of the series. That did not satisfy this reader at all.Despite the creativity that shines every now and then, the story itself falls flat on its face. There is no actual ending. And even though there is some action and forward motion, nothing big enough happens to justify calling this a complete book.To sum up: this is a set-up for a series and not good on its own."
2,SLOW! Frustrating ending,"This book was very slow, and nothing ever really seemed to happen. It ended right at the climax, and instead of making me think ""I want to know what happens next!"" it made me think ""Well, that was dumb.""There were parts of the story that were interesting, but a lot of it was just cliché and rushed. I may read to the sequel if I can find it, but if I can't I won't worry about it."
4,Decent DVD from Foreigner's 25th Anniversary tour,"All Access Tonight captures Foreigner's 25th Anniversary Tour on film.Besides Concert footage,there is behind the scenes footage such as sound checks,checking in to a motel,and the tour bus,things that won't interest causual fans,but hardcore fans will kind of enjoy.The concert footage is decent,but shot with only a single camera,the band is good.Lou Gramm's voice is pretty good,only downside as far as I'm concerned is ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" is not on here,can't imagine a Foreigner concert without them playing this song.Live at Deer Creek is the best Foreigner DVD out there,this one is more for hardcore fans."
1,Garbage,"If you are a true Foreigner fan, and want to stay that way, then don't buy this terrible DVD. I can't believe the band would allow themselves to be remembered this way. Lou Gram is one of my all time favorite vocalists, Long Hard Look, Ready Or Not, master pieces. I couldn't stand to watch the whole DVD, and watch these guys destroy the fond memories I had of the group. I never thought I would think or say it, but their washed up, time to retire."
2,"Regardless, it's ashamed its out!","It is understandable that Lou Gramm was given a chance to sing, but, in spite of his surgery and weight gain, the video is poorly shot (there are scenes from a hotel lobby doing registration and taken shots of the tiles!!), the camera work is very poor, the sound is lacking, and of course Lou Gramm is but a shadow of his prior persona. To keep the memory alive, check the older stuff."
1,WOW... What a dismal performance,"Fourth time watching this video just in case I was too quick to rush to judgement. Spend your money on lottery tickets. I love Foreigner (and still do) but don't buy this video. American Idol performers (even the worst) do better than Lou Gramm in this specific video. In this video, Lou couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. I wish he was drunk but I don't think that was his issue this evening. The rest of the band looks tired and unwilling to perform as well. I felt sympathic for the band afterwards because it felt like they were 90 days away from checking in to their local nursing home. Send you money to me and I'll mail you my DVD. I'll pay for shipping and whatever offer you make I'll knock another four bucks off."
2,Horrible Vocals,"When I bought this DVD I was very excited. ""What could rock more than a Foreigner DVD?"". I think a rock could rock harder. The vocals were horrible. The singer tries to ""change up"" the lyrics but only succeeds in making the vocals off-tempo with the songs. I think he might be too old to hit the high notes anymore, because he sang very low and sped up through the high-note parts.The editing was mediocore, if that. I got very frustrated at parts where they would have video over-lap the concert or visa-versa. It'd be a nice transistion effect, but it stayed like that for a good while.The rest of the band was excellent though. They rocked. Save your money and don't be dissapointed. Now if you will excuse me, I have to go detox myself with some of my old Foreigner albums."
1,I can't believe...,"no one mentioned the fact that Lou Gramm has lost his voice. It makes watching this DVD extremely painful. Why would a band of Foreigner caliber would even tour with Gramm unable to sing. Money, of course, but I don't really think this DVD is the legacy they want to leave their fans with..."
4,Don't listen to the bozo's above,"Ya, the video looks like a cheap bar but the sound is pretty good. Those other guys must have some cheap wanna be surround sound system. I was never a fan of Juke Box Hero, but it jams on this DVD. I buy these dvd's for sound and not to watch the video (so who cares what they look like)!!"
1,How not to impress your fans...,1. Play your best songs but never hit the high notes.2. Gain 40 pounds.3. Lose most of your hair and damage what is left.4. Act goofy.5. Cheap out on any and all production value.6. Sprinkle the DVD cover with misleading promotional fluff.I wouldn't use this for a Frisbee.
4,Not as bad as some say,"This DVD has decent production, I don't think they sound as bad as some of these people are saying. I really enjoyed it as a matter of fact. Yes its not perfect but rarely is anything. The sound quality of the DVD itself is very good, just being able to hear some of these classics live when I never got to see these guys is still an awesome Experience. If your a fan of these guys, and want most of the hit songs on a live dvd with a decent show for a nice price check this out for yourself. Don't be swayed by those who are way too picky here, its not like they asked 25$ for this dvd. I still enjoyed hearing these songs, even though they are not in the prime, you have make some sacrifices to see the bands you like years later, no group from the 60's, 70's, or even 80's and 90's are in their prime anymore, to expect that is being unrealistic."
2,"For a 25th Anniversary, this should've been better","Knowing the great music and performances that Foreigner has done over the years, I can't figure out why they chose to make the DVD using only footage of Lou Gramm after his throat sugery. I mean, yeah...use some of it to show the present, but I would have to believe that far greater footage exists that would payng fitting tribute to an incredible rock band. I recommend LIVE at Deer Creek on DVD"
1,Please read! Where do I begin!!,"Once more I purchased a DVD concert nightmare. If only I would have read these reviews. I have been collecting Concert DVDs for about a year. I only recently came to Amazon, and have reviewed a few of my collection. Please read my reviews if you are an 80s Concert fan.I like some of the others was excited to find Foreigner on DVD. My wife and I sat down, grabbed a couple of Beers and were shocked. It was so bad we couldnt even get through the first song. It looks and sounds like I filmed it from the audience drunk. There really isnt anything good about any part of it, except that you have Foreigner on stage.If only I would have seen this one before I reviewed the Police. I would have at least given the Police Concert 2 stars for sound.Take these reviews seriously, for real...Matt in K-town.."
2,"Nice feeder, but beware of corners","I really enjoyed this feeder for a long time, mainly because it has such a large capacity and many birds can fit around it, and it seemed sturdy. However, one day I walked out to refill it and found a dead finch hanging by its little foot from it. Its talon had become caught in a tiny gap between the corners of the lip, where two sections of the lip join. I can't imagine the agony that poor birdie endured before finally dying. I taped up the gap, but really, felt like throwing the thing away.Just make sure there are no hidden hazards when you purchase this product."
5,Large Capacity Feeder - Birds Love It!,"This feeder is a bird lovers dream come true. The large capacity feeder means that you won't be filling it every day. The birds love the perch that is provided around the base of the feeder. It is a very sturdy feeder and will last for years. I have recommended it to all of my friends! No yard should be without one.......or two!T. List Mason City, IL"
5,Happy Birds,"The backyard birds are really enjoying their new diner. I have a double suet cage and a squirrel proof feeder, but they seem drawn to the newer feeder. More birds on the perches of the Triple Bin probably because there is more room vs. the squirrel proof that only has two smaller places to stand. Very happy with my purchase and so are my feathered friends."
4,"Heavy Duty, Long Lasting Feeder","I was surprised when I received this feeder. It is one of the best built, heavy duty feeders I've seen in a long time for the money. Along with the feeder, they send you all the material to mount it several different ways. The roof comes off and the clear feed holders separate from the base for easy cleaning. I currently am hanging this feeder on a feeder pole I purchased at Lowe's and the feeder is almost too wide for this pole. As it hangs from one of the arms, the feeders side is about a 1/4 inch from the main pole. It holds a large amount of feed so I don't have to refill it but once every two weeks."
1,useless video,"this instructional video is of no use , you can learn more just by pushing buttons on unit. shows features and does not show how to use them at all. you can scroll down your menu and do the same thing!"
1,does not control dish network,"Can not be programed to control Dish network receiver.I would not have purchased the useless so called ""universal remote"", if I knew it would not control Dish receiver."
2,low price but low quality as well.,"I bought this to replace two of my remotes that I either lost or broke. The remote does work with all the devices that I wanted it to but not all the functions are availabe with it. I couldn't use the zoom function for my DVD player, the menu for my tv would not come up either. these are things that I do miss. I bought another remote for all and that seems to be working well. I just use this one as a spare now. Don't waist your money on this remote."
1,"Poor product quality, poor service from the manufacturer","I've had two Universal Remotes go bad in the same way just weeks apart. I returned the first unit to the manufacturer and was told a replacement was shipping to me. It's been 2 months, I have not received a replacement, and the company will not return my emails, letters, or phone calls. Although the manuals are well written and programming was a breeze, I'd recommend buying another brand that you can count on. Universal Remote Control is a terrible company."
4,"Despite the title, quite lively","Dead Souls has a lot to recommend it. Gogol's style is lively and wide ranging, he's capable of showing how venal, petty and corrupt every level of his society, from the poorest serfs to the most officious princes can be. And it totally demolishes the idiotic idea that people living in far flung provinces are all somehow provincial, romantic innocents. The book has a wild sort of energy to it, especially compared to a lot of subsequent 19th century Russian literature, which is really great, but very intentionally 'heavy' in a way this just isn't. And I'm not implying that Gogol is any less serious or powerful of a writer than Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, et al. Case in point: ""Numberless as the sands of the sea are the passions of man and none is like any other, and all of them, the base and the beautiful, in the beginning are submissive to man, and only later do they a establish a terrible tyranny over him."" And how."
2,Kindle (Free Version) Table of Contents Needs Correction,"The free Kindle version of Gogol's ""Dead Souls"" is correct as far as part One is concerned. For part Two, the chapters point to those in part One. In other words, Part Two, Chapter One points to the first chapter in Part One. Not a big deal, but it should be corrected. As far as the book, the worst ""classic"" I've ever read. I'll just leave it at that."
1,Do not buy the edition published by Empire Books,"This just goes to show that you really should look before you leap. It is posted that this edition is 9"" x 6"" which I would have seen if I had looked at the posted details. But, additionally, it weighs a ton! The font size is also unnecessarily large and there is a weird space between every paragraph. These things create a high page count and add to the bulk. Overall, this book is too heavy and awkward to hold and my hands were aching by page 15."
1,what is this crud?,"Do not order this edition!My Signet copy had too many underlinings so I thought I'd replace it with this one.But what a mistake. This is one of those mass-printed books that the Internet + Amazon has now made possible. I'm not sure what they're called. But they're monstrosities: custom-printed in a run of one, I assume, shortly after you order one.So basically some machine somewhere took a free, public-domain version of the text and prints it into this heavy, oversized paperback and sends it to me.It has no publisher listed! No translator! And no copyright page! It's like the thing fell out of heaven.What's worst, predictably, is that the text is riddled with errors and may not even be complete.Am I wrong to assume some automated process at Amazon simply ""realized"" their free Kindle version?Amazon groups many of these reviews together, so let me be clear: the one I'm talking about has a girl looking out an arched window to her left."
5,A great classic even without the last part,"Dead Souls is a romp through Russia and it is only sad that Gogol was so despondent that he burned part of part 2 and never did part 3. This is delightful satire and is one of my favorite Russian novels. I had to sell my library of 3000 books when I sold my house, but thanks to my Kindle have been able to reconstruct some of my collection of Russian literature. --Reviewed by Harley Sachs, author of 30 books onthe Kindle list."
4,What a great writer,"I never read Gogol until now... It is a revelation. Hard to believe that this book was written 200 years ago - it is so refreshing and inspiring.I thought the Russian writers were somber in their perspective of life, but there are many funny passages in this book. Still very readable!"
1,Checkerbee Series Is Horrible,"This is a horrible series with information that becomes outdated very quickly. Save your money and buy Beanie Babies, instead."
5,Great Book!,"This is the best Beanie value guide I've seen! Has loads of info, pics, tag chronology, all of the new beanies, checklist, and so much more! Buy it today!"
2,Great When These Work,"The Samsung DLPs look fantastic while they are actually working. I would advise getting a service plan, however. I have had an earlier model for two years, and it has been riddled with problems. Because I bought a service plan, I have not paid for repairs, but the TV has been out of commission for a total of 3 months due to a long waiting period for replacement parts. Problems have included lamp failure, color wheel failure, and fan failure. Frankly, I would not purchase another one of these TVs due to the very poor reliability that I have experienced."
2,Buyer BEWARE,"We got this TV a fews months back. We were impressed with the great picture quality and were excited for our new purchase. TWO days later, after very little use, that great picture was gone and all we had was audio. The lamp went out. We never bothered to get it fixed, we returned it right away! There is nothing like dropping $2,000 on something and having it bust in two days. We opted to spend a little more money on a Sony LCD and we are SO happy with it. Sometimes I still hold my breath when we are turning it on, but we have had NO problems yet. Do your research!"
1,"Quality picture, worst possible build quality and service.","I purchased the 46"" DLP exactly 2 years and a month ago. 18 months or so after purchase the unit started shutting off by itself with the red lamp light flashing inconsistent times. On some nights it will barely stay on while it can go weeks without an incident. Again, very inconsistent. Called Samsung and the rep on the phone said ""Sorry but that is not a known issue and you are out of warranty.""Anyways, it's a shame this problem is so common and deal breaking, because the picture itself is magnificent. I will not be purchasing another Samsung product after this mess."
4,"Hours of mindless entertainment with many opportunities to do a ""write your own""","The knock, knock joke is essentially a simple pun with extension. The initial response to the ""who's there?"" response is a short pun with the punch line that ends the joke an extension of that pun. They tend to be very silly and clean, although when I was working construction we would occasionally try to top each other in the level of dirtiness in our knock, knock jokes. However, most of the time we kept it clean as we bantered the jokes back and forth, coming up with variations on the last one that had been uttered.These knock, knock jokes are amusing, a tribute to the number of silly puns that can be made in the English language. All are squeaky clean and can provide several hours of largely mindless entertainment. It is also fun to come up with your own variations of the jokes, given the allowable weaknesses of the puns, generally that is not very difficult."
5,MY FAVE,"This and 'Otis Blue' were my favorites. Used to play them back to back, over and over. Glad to have it on cd."
4,Wow! So soft!,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter after buying a smaller one for her class. She was delighted and sleeps with it at the foot of her bed! Highly recommend!
4,Crusoe Remake a Good Effort,"Robinson Crusoe starring Pierce Brosnan as our hero, is a good film adaptation overall that I would recommend. It is almost entirely without nudity (one brief scene, Crusoe's girl from behind) and it hits a lot of the points about the book that make it a useful educational tool such as how Crusoe got his supplies off the wrecked ship, built his ""castle"", fought cannibals and lived his life. The movie does go places the book by Daniel Defoe never goes, such as a conflict with Crusoe and Friday over religion (Friday becomes a Christian in the book). Also the reason for Crusoe's exile is a duel about the above mentioned woman, and that is nowhere in the book. The film should be used educationally only if the the original story is also covered so a comparison can be made. Ideally, a modern film more faithful to the original could someday be made. Until then, this film does a good job."
3,An interesting variation,"The slavery aspect was offputting, but the pleasure of the other natives at hearing Friday's story raised my rating."
1,Once was enough,"The movie, ""Robinson Crusoe"" seems to be centered wholly on the notion that human race is not fit to be alive at all. It throws prejudices in ones face, without dealing with them. Flies corruption like a banner without the balance of integrity, and altogether butchers Daniel Defoe's account of Robinson Crusoe's escapades. Through gunfight and anger, harsh words and mixed-up sequences this film ambles. Leaving the viewer with the impression that all good things come to an end, but the bad remain forever. It is this sort of movie that makes a person grateful to the movie rentals. One viewing was enough for me!"
3,so so ...,"average movie. Nice to see Pierce Brosnan with a beard.Not much action, but how much action can you have stranded in the Pacific?"
1,What a rotten movie!,"The plot of Daniel Dafoe's classic has been made so politically correct in this movie that it is downright BORING...if Dafoe had written his book this way originally, it never would have become a classic. Ugh!"
1,waste of time,"I'm still trying to figure out how they got away with calling this movie ""robinson crusoe"". It has few similarities to the book. If you enjoyed the book, do not watch this movie. It just made me angry.I'm usually not one to be like ""oh the book is way better than the movie"", but in this case the movie leaves out massive detail and makes up things that never even happened in the book.Here is an example:Book-- Crusoe on island for 28 yearsMovie-- 6 years."
1,This movie is an abomination.,I think others have summed it up quite well. I'm just adding this to have some impact on a scoring which has been defined by the puerile reviews of those unfamiliar with the works of Defoe. Maybe if this movie had been titled 'boring adventure on an island involving more PC feel good moments for the racially concerned' instead of usurping the title of a great novel I could feel otherwise.
1,"Robinson Crusoe the movie, don't see it!!!","I am a big fan of Robinson Crusoe, but then these stupid movie people have to go and screw it up!!!! I mean dang, he was supposed to be on the island for 28 years but they changed it all up so that he is only there for 6!!!!!?? Whoever reads this, DO NOT SEE IT IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!! Also they did not include him living in a cave and having a home in the country and a farm in the Brazils. They did not show how he was able to plant stuff or how he go the goats and sheep that he survied on. Friday was also a ripoff, in the book he was more tanned than African American. And if you notice in the movie he had a toucan but in the book he had a parrot that he taught to speak to him. And more about Friday, he had converted his religion to Christianity but he kept his religion. Now all i have to say is that if Amazon had -5stars i would pick that."
1,Ruined a great story,Don't waste your time or money on this one. They took a great story and ruined it with political correctness.
1,ABSOLUTELY HERENDOUS,I watched the first five minutes of it and cried. Iam telling you now if your a Damian Lewis fan Do Not watch this film. He has like 6 short lines then dies. It was a waste of my money to see my favorite actor die with 6 lines...
2,T fal Ultimate Cookware Set,"T-Fal E603SA62 Ultimate Non-Stick Cookware Set 10-pc.This cookware set is very nicely made with one unfortunate exception: the large stock pot isn't exactly round and therefore the glass lid that is suppose to fit doesn't! Now I have to use a generic ""fits all"" lid with my brand new T fal stockpot. Yes, I could have sent the whole set back and incurred a large shipping charge and hopefully got a better set in return but decided not to. I still like T fal cookware, and this is the second set that I have purchased, but I'm disappointed in that one huge flaw."
2,Not what they used to be.,"Received set fast from Amazon. Box was in good condition but two of the lids for the pots had minor damage.Did not want to go through the hassle of packing everything up and returning so I called T-fal. They said theywould replace the lids with with no problem. Problem is that they do not make these lids anymore so I wouldhave to send them the damaged lids and they would match them up with whatever was close. Sounds like a problemto me. I did not buy this set so I could have lids that were close to fitting. Also. T-fal's web site saysthat this set is made in France. The box says China and the customer service rep said it's made in China. Longstory short, I fixed the lids as best I could and will not be buying T-fal anymore."
5,Best you can buy for this price,This is the best t-fal set you can buy. Lasts a very long time. I have two sets before I bought this one. Now I dont have to do the dishes as often. You cant go wrong if you buy this set.
2,disappointed,"i've been a tfal customer for 20 years and have always found it to be a great value, good quality and very durable - until now...as seen in some other reviews, the pots are slightly warped which makes it impossible to put the lids on them. this was the case for the 5qt dutch oven and 3qt saucepan. the 1qt saucepan was not warped but had two scratches on it. not the end of the world but i rather scratch it up myself. i'll be contacting tfal to get a replacement for the 3 defective items but what a pain! i'll keep my fingers crossed that this won't wind up being a nightmare.oh, just to clarify, the item description failed to mention that the set also comes with a plastic spatula and spoon which makes up the total 12 piece set."
2,Had issues with the smallest frying pan.,"Everything sticks to that non-stick pan. I called T-Fal and they have told me a few things to try to make it ""extra clean"" nothing has worked. They don't seem to want to replace the pan either."
3,Why Aren't There Lids for the Saute/Frying Pans?,"The pans are fine, perhaps a little handle-heavy. They tend to tip if they're empty. I had expected that the saute pans were able to use the lids that came with the saucepans. Uh, no - and apparently, T-fal doesn't make lids for these particular sizes. SO, all of those recipes that you have that say, ""cover,"" and imply that the lids need a tight fit, you may not want to use these. Now, T-fal does sell saute pans with lids, but not as part of a set."
3,Could have been a better value,"This set had the features that I was looking for I ordered it quickly. The week I received it I found the same set regularly priced for $7.00 less with free shipping at JC Penny's. I should have checked more websites. Also, the largest pot is not totally round which makes the lit not fit correctly. Didn't send it back because too much trouble. I do like the product and features."
1,On cyber monday...it went from $126 to $140,"I've had my eye on this set for a while and wanted to buy it as a gift on Cyber Monday. ""What a deal""! Instead of going down as a special it went from $126.78 day before to $140+ on Monday 11/29/2010. Amazon is tricky that way. Their prices jump all over; therefore look out!"
3,I love Amy Tan,I purchased this due to the author. It is a kids book and I gave it as a gift. I hope the recipient enjoys Tan's writing as much as I have over the years.
5,Perfect snack.,"I absolutely love anything that has to do with cheese. I've always loved plain Quaker rice cakes, so when these tiny cheesy treats came out I knew I had to try them. I actually devoured a whole bag by myself a week ago- they are that delicious. They're crunchy and light and SO yummy. The cheese flavoring is actually a mix of both cheddar and blue cheeses, so I think that is what gives them a nice unique flavor. I can seriously sit and eat a whole bag within minutes. I try to savor each one but they're so yummy I just can't. They are really the most perfect snack out there- a far better choice than something like Smartfood or Cheddar $ Sour Cream Lays (both snacks I was partial to buying before I discovered these). They are worth a try- you will definitely love them. I would give them 100 stars if I could. :D"
4,Proceed without fear,"I picked up this book because I am mentoring someone who wants to overcome their fear of public speaking. While I have extensive experience as a public speaker, I did not have any references to help my protege.After reviewing several books I chose this one because Ivy addresses some areas which I consider important including the physical aspect of public speaking and not merely the preparation of a speech.I laughed as I read this book because what she recommends I employ in my public speaking. The one topic I did not see was controlling nervous habits such as verbal fillers and physical twitches.Overall, highly recommended! I am encouraging my 12-year old daughter to read it to strengthen her school presentations."
3,Tracey Mallett Exercise DVD,The DVD is pretty good although I prefer some of my older dvd's. Part of it may be that I am more comfortable with them from practice.
4,"Just the CD to spin on a hot, sweltering day.","The title piece of this CD is the epitome of a composition that attempts to evoke a visceral response by careful control of the score. One can almost develop frostbite just listening. The cold, blue-white texture of the music is wonderful. The sea songs have an almost-authentic air that causes one to think of rolling decks and sea-spray dampened canvas. Good art."
4,Very Nice Reading of the Piece,This is probably not the most moving performance of the 5 Variants od Dives and Lazarus but it captures the general essence of the work.
2,"Revelation, the Religions, and Violence","I was very disappointed with the book. After the initial excitement of the promise to ""extend"" Girard's understanding of mimetic violence to a multireligious context, I soon realized the limitations of the author's understanding (or rather misunderstanding) of Girard's most important thesis-the uniqueness of the Gospels and the Triumph of the Cross. Girard's understanding is therefore gutted by the author's approach."
1,Learn to talk like an oba-san,"It's hard to dislike a book where one of the first sentences you learn in ""Oh no! Grandmother has fallen in the septic tank again!"" The problem with this book is that it teaches Japanese as it was spoken maybe 60 years ago, while the language has rapidly changed both in formal speech, and more particularly, in informal speech. An easy example is the use of ""watakushi"" for the 1st person singular - which is something like saying ""thee"" for the 2nd person singular. I showed this book to a native speaker, and they just laughed - ""that's how my grandmother talks!"" The book has character, but you won't learn current Japanese from it."
3,"NOT ""easy"" but interesting comments on common phrases","I can't agree that this is ""easy"" - the grammar explanations are puzzling and non-existent in the case of uses of verb conjugations (except for the difference between plain and polite forms). The pattern exercises are fun and interesting, and there is a fairly good range of vocabulary presented. But the student will not find this an easy book to use if a beginner to Japanese. A casual traveler to Japan would, however, find the explanations of the most common polite phrases quite interesting."
3,A fun book,"People with some background in Japanese will enjoy seeing how the language has changed since this was written- yes it is out-dated in many respects. However, I disagree with one of the other reveiwers who says that watakushi is ike ""thee"". ""Watakushi"" is still in common use- but in formal situations rather than in casual speech.I think the main use of this book is for entertainment- when you feel you should study but can't face your regular text. However, if you are looking specificaly for such a book -I'd reccomend ""Making Sense of Japanese"" by Jay Rubin."
2,Not quite so easy Japanese.,"While Easy Japanese has an interesting and breezy writing style, it is not a very accessible book for beginning language students. Mr. Seward provides a number of sentences to memorize and the student is then supposed to use these sentences as a template for further communications. I tried this approach and didn't find it particularly effective. The grammatical explanations can be rather technical and require a better than average knowledge of grammatical and linguistic terms.On the positive side, Seward's writing is lively and interesting and he does a good job explaining a number of linguistic fine points."
5,Japanese Language Guide,This book was very informative and easy to understand. Learning Japanese is extremely hard but this book makes it a lot easier. It teaches everything from Hiragana to Kanji and also alot of vocabulary words. Great book!
2,"If it works fine, but if you try to uninstall","It does not uninstall correctly, if you should happen to reinstall windows, and try to get virusscan to update it does really wierd things."
5,A highly detailed design workbook,"The Essential Garden Design Workbook is a highly detailed design workbook especially intended for serious home gardeners, students of design, and professionals. Expertly written by Rosemary Alexander (the founder and principal of The English Gardening School), The Essential Garden Design Workbook is illustrated cover-to-cover with simple diagrams and sections of full color photographs. Individual chapters deftly cover necessary research and preparations, how to develop the initial design, what to take into account when finalizing the garden layout plan, creating a planting plan, visualizing and constructing the design, and a host of minor details. The Essential Garden Design Workbook is highly recommended as a detailed instructional for learning to blend individually creative instincts with practical necessities to create truly memorable gardens."
4,"Good, but VERY technical","This is a very detailed, very technical book on planning every conceivable aspect of garden design. From fences to pergolas to hedges to ponds, it's all in here. Normally I love detailed books but this was actually a bit more technical than I had hoped for. It's almost like a textbook for professionals (which certainly isn't a bad thing)."
1,No Title,This was ordered for a gift and it only had 10 minutes on the DVD and I was very disappointed. There was nothing that told me it was only a 10 minute DVD and for the price; it was ridiculous.
5,OLD SCHOOL GEM THAT NEVER GETS OLD,This is one of the best old school hip hop albums ever. You simply must hear this. I can play is CD from beginning to end. Do yourself a big favor and buy this CD. You will not be disappointed. Can't say enough about it.
5,this book changed my life!,"Seriously, I've been sounding like an informercial to all my friends since I read this book. I have a whole new attitude about money--I'm not a victim anymore. Unlike most books about personal finance, this is a book for those of us who don't make much money to begin with. In a matter of a couple of months I have over a month's pay in the bank--this has never happened before. Now I know I don't have to rely on the EVIL credit card. I figure budgets are like diets--what works for some people may not work for others, but this plan WORKS FOR ME. Listen, I don't know the author, I don't work for the author...but I love her. Read this book!"
2,"Danger, Will Robinson!","While Carol Keeffe's method is superficially appealing, the problem is that by paying only the minimum on your credit cards, you consign yourself to years of debt and hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest payments. It seems like she is encouraging people to be in denial about their debts -- which is probably what got them into trouble in the first place! While Keeffe's method is better than nothing (at least she insists you cut up the credit cards!), a faster and (in my opinion) much better method is the one used by Mary Hunt in her books ""Debt-Proof Living"" and ""The Complete Cheapskate."""
4,"Helpful, encouraging, but...","In general, I thought this was a good personal finance book, especially the idea of having numerous savings accounts for various goals. But one thing made me want to throw the book out the window: she kept mentioning interest rates for CD's and savings accounts of 10-15 percent. On what planet does this woman do her banking? It makes me question the wisdom of paying only the minimum on a high-interest credit card (as she recommends) while earning a paltry 2.0% in a savings account, or 6% (if you're lucky) in a CD."
3,I was already doing these things.....................,"This book did not really tell me anything I did not already know or wasn't already doing. So I agree with what's in the book, but obviously did not need to buy the book."
5,Great and aimed at real people,Carol Keeffe realizes that money is more than mathematics. She doesn't offer ideas that work for computers but not people.I bought a copy after I'd checked out the library copy so often it was showing wear!
3,This Is What It Is Like,"This is the story of military interrotagtors, how they are trained, and what they do in combat. To my knowledge it hasn't been told before. I see this as a pretty reasonable and accurate account -- Chris Mackey is obviously one of the most capable, cleve, and cunning linguists DLI has ever produced.Dave Taggart (Arabic class 02-78)"
1,didn'get the purchase...,"So far I didn't get the purchase. Obviously the German Postal Service sent it back to... So I would kindly ask you to send it again...otherwise I cannot rate anything.Sincerely,Stefan Schaller"
2,Great--Except for.....,"I see this model is no longer listed by Amazon, so I don't know how you got here. First, it was sold by J&R;, not for the advertised price of $59.21, but for $69.99!!However, shipping and handling was half of what DBROTH wanted.Second, there is no light on the timer. Unreadable even with normal ambient light.Third, the start and stop buttons are hard to find. Used the old standby, fingernail polish to highlight them.Fourth, and most serious, the Power Setting doesn't work. I have no idea what the power setting is set at. Buy a microwave or similar putchase locally. That way you can take it back and complain like hell. As for me, I will keep it because of the high cost of shipping it back, but not buy similar products from Amazon unless shipped directly from Amazon and with free shipping."
5,Hard to beat for the $$$$$$,"I fish a lot of top water and this thing performed like a DREAM! Never once gave me a problem and I throw a lot of 3/8oz plugs. Drag stays set, reel is smooth as silk. You can pay a LOT more for a reel but you can't touch this quality/performance/value. Gonna get me a spare so I got 2 ready to go. Some of the newer design reels look real pretty, but try taking those rascals apart for oiling/greasing! This ones a snap, ""old school"" no doubt but ""when it ain't broke, don't fix it!"""
2,SMALL,"Tried this product, thought it was what I had. It was to small. Had to send it back. Found out that the one I bought was no longer made and tried a different one. Don't really like the new one either it has to much room in it. Don't get me wrong the products are great and I loved the one I had."
5,Small but powerful.,I had to raise my eyebrow at the huge box which only held such a small tube but I was satisfied in the end. I'll be getting the bigger bottle now I know it works.
3,Great for the collection!,"PD Harris' review is spot-on. I only wanted to add that the singer on It's All In The Game is actually David Byron, the original lead singer for Uriah Heep, and a great singer in his own right."
5,Anna Rinaldi does it again!!!!!,"This is a really, really good book. It's one of the first Ann Rinaldi books I ever read, and I loved it!!! The plot is really good, and the characters are easy to like. You sorta feel Rachel's confusion, pain and joy.This is really worth your time!!!"
5,A genuinely wonderful contribution to great literature.,"This beautifully researched book is a must-read for all interested in authentically presented historical fiction. A well written page-turner, filled with drama and issues close to us all."
3,This wasn't as good as the other Ann Rinaldi's.,"'The Fifth of March' was the sixth or seventh Ann Rinaldi I've read, and frankly, it just wasn't as good."
2,Masterpiece plot ruined by unnecessary ramble,"Ann Rinaldi Ruins her reputation with this seemingly entertaining book. As with most books the back makes it out to be something it is not. It tells of a story between a young Bostonian girl, Rachel Marsh, and a soldier of the 29th regiment who become ensnared in a relationship of forbidden love. Though this may appeal to most readers, it turned me away because the object of Rachel's affection is not introduced untill halfway through the somewhat jumbled tale. Even after they are introduced through a twisted fate meeting, the story is spent dwelling on the young girl's thoughts rather than a real plot. The plot is incorperated but it seems more of a side story rather than an overall novel. In conclusion I feel that this is undeniably boring book that had the potential to become a masterpiece. Thanks Ms. Rinaldi for wasting my time with your ""words on pages."""
3,How does an Amish mother spend her days?,"My curiosity about the Amish allowed me to really enjoy this book. The author mingles two years of actual diary entries written in the `70's by Amish friend, Sarah, with experiences in areas she shares with Sarah - gardening, quilting, cooking/ recipes, and writing. By the end of the book I felt I knew something about Amish community interaction, and the life of a wife and mother skilled in and married to the home arts.The author relates getting to know Sarah and Amish life as somewhat spiritual and shares her introspections. I couldn't drum up any spirituality. My reaction was simply `How like us they are, and yet, how different.' If you're curious about the Amish wife and mother's day-to-day, the book will interest you."
4,An inside look at the daily life of an Old Order Amish Woman,"I think that many of us are facinated by the Amish and their way of life. Most of us will never have the chance to become close friends with an Amish woman and have the chance to observe her life close up. This book takes you into the day by day life of Sarah and lets you vicariously experience what it's like to live the ""plain life"". We see the various seasons as recorded in her diary over a 2 year period of time. Her developing friendship with the ""English"" author is touching and enlightening. This is a special book."
5,Reflections from a working biologist,"Mayr's book is a superb reflection on the place biology deserves among the sciences and among all other intellectual disciplines. He clearly explains the accomplishments and uniqueness of biological science. As one would expect, his reflections on evolutionary biology are his strongest."
1,Nothing new....,"Nothing with ac/dc ever is new, it's to the point that every album they make is the same as Back In Black over and over again....boring."
2,LET`S SEE IT,"Let's make a list of the following albuns: ""FLY ON THE WALL"" / ""BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO"" / ""RAZOR'S EDGE"" / BALLBREAKER / STIFF UPPER LIP. I don't inlcude WHO MADE WHO here because it has only a few original tunes, the rest of the track listing is a compilation. Well. THE RAZOR'S EDGE is, by far, the best of them all, and even so deserves only two stars... WHy? BEcause AC/DC really lost it after FLICK OF THE SWITCH (or FOR THOSE ABOUT, if you prefer to be radical..). WHy do you thing this band started to release an album each five years only ??!! Because they don't like money? No, just because their capacity to write their trademark great rock songs waned definitely."
3,"Well, at least the first four songs are good...","This is a HUGE improvement over 80's albums such as Flick of the Switch, Blow Up Your Video and For Those About to Rock. It still feels kind of uninspired, but at least it contains three of my AC/DC favorites: Thunderstruck, Moneytalks and the title track, plus Fire Your Guns. But it dies out after this, and AC/DC churns out pointless song after pointless song. It's an improvement, though."
2,The Razor is dull,"Thunderstruck is really the only song on the disc that ""sticks to you"" The rest are throwaways. A prime example (unfortunately) of a band living on former glories. Prior to this I can remember Who Made Who being a good song. They probably should've hung it up after Flick of the Switch."
3,"Ho-Hum , ACDC collecting another paycheck","This is the typical ACDC of the '90's, not too bad, but not very good either. This CD to be fair probably deserves 2.5 stars - it's that mediocre. The band just cannot live up to Back in Black and Highway to Hell. Kinda boring really, with dumb lyrics, but boring ACDC is better than most of the garbage out there nowadays. Buy it on sale, and don't expect anything too great."
1,Used to like it,I used to like AC/DC's one good song of this album until I heard it so many times that I got sick to death of it. If you took all of AC/DC's albums stripped the garbage and filler of each you would have enough songs for one good album.
1,THE PATIENCE'S EDGE !!!,"I had enough from AC/DC !!! I bought album after album by them, my favourite band. Then I had to see the band choose a complete uncapable singer (in terms of voice, not live performance) to replace Bon SCott. I managed to handle it, with the great BACK IN BLACK and the very good FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK. Then I had to testify the total loss of reativity from the band, to hera Johnson writing the worst lyrics I can remember in my entire life and the music going nowhere."
5,You've Been... THUNDERSTRUCK,"""The Razors Edge"" is definately my favorite AC/DC album. They finally got back on track after a few years of mediocre recordings. ""Thunderstruck"" was a huge hit and still is today. Not only is the this song great in every aspect, the title itself makes the song sound good. Here are the best hits on this cd.THUNDERSTRUCK- I'm just gonna say it, BEST ROCK SONG WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY OF TIME.MONEYTALKS- Of course it's not as good as Thunderstruck, but is another great hit.THE RAZORS EDGE- Deserved more recognition, but what can you do? Still a great addition to this album.Although ""The Razors Edge"" was released in 1990, I don't think America can ever forget this record. It slammed rock n roll back into the world. Buy this album, it is impossible to regret it."
5,A Classic Record-Best ACDC album since Back in Black,"Listening to this record is so refreshing compared to the...nu-metal that is popular now. This is a great album because there are no bad songs. If you already have BIB and you like Brian Johnson pick this record up, You wont be dissapointed!"
3,ANOTHER GOOD ALBUM FROM AC/DC,"The first 3 tracks on this album are sensational: THUNDERSTRUCK, FIRE YOUR GUNS & one of the greatest ever AC/DC songs MONEYTALKS.The rest of the album falls away somewhat, but ROCK YOUR HEART OUT is rather good."
3,"SOLID ALBUM, BUT ...","SOlid AC/DC album, one of the best, but .... it's no even closer to the ""real"" AC/DC, the one who finished after FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, in 1981 ... Anyway, THE RAZOR'S EDGE was a marked improvment over the last mediocre studio albuns released by the band."
3,The Razors Edge,"Although AC/DC's popularity had decreased by the early '90s, the band still had a lot of life left in it. Arguably the Australian headbangers' strongest album in over half a decade, The Razor's Edge is quintessential AC/DC -- rowdy, abrasive, unapologetically fun metal full of blistering power chords, memorable hooks, and testosterone-driven lyrics. Lead singer Brian Johnson sounds more inspired than he had since 1983's Flick of the Switch, and lead guitarist Angus Young isn't about to take any prisoners on such hard-hitting material as ""Shot of Love,"" the menacing title song, and the appropriately titled ""Got You By the Balls."" Although not quite in a class with Back in Black, Highway to Hell, or Let There Be Rock -- all of which would, for novices, serve as fine introductions to the distinctive band -- The Razor's Edge was a welcome addition to AC/DC's catalog."
5,One of my favorites!,"What I like about these guys is that they're fun and easy to enjoy.Ever since I've heard these guys I've learned to appreciate more ""older"" bands now.I have 5 ac/dc albums and Razors Edge comes in at No.3.Live is 2,Back in Black is 1 of course.Thunderstuck was such an awesome song,but my other favorites on this would have to be ""Fire Your Guns"", ""Mistress for Christmas"",""Moneytalks"",and ""Got You by the Balls.""Each track is special in it's own way.I gotta give it to these guys.To me this is just as good as Back in Black,and Highway to Hell.Such a comebeack from their previous albums ""Flick of the Switch"",and ""Fly on the Wall"" really didn't do much for me."
4,Best drums sound ever on an AC/DC album,"It's a pity that drummer Chris Slade lasted for such a short time in Ac/DC. In this album, producer Bruce Fairbairn managed to create the best drums sound ever recorded on an AC/DC album. Even if Slade maitains the tradition of ""low profile drumming"" of the band, the sound of his drusm are powerful, crispy, helping the music in a manner AC/DC seldom had witnessed.The songs are very good, the twelve of them. For the first time AC/DC released an album with 12 new songs. Thy were adapting to the time of the CD... And suceeded completely, because this album was much, MUCH better than previous albums Blow Up Your Video and Fly On The Wall (The ""Simon Wright"" albums). After The Razor's Edge, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip were also pale in comparison."
4,Dumb lyrics accompanying stirring rock n' roll.,"For years I couldn't reconcile myself to AC/DC's sexist, mallet-headed lyrics and party-hearty antics, but this album helped win me over. Mind you, the boys can't write anything verbally meaningful to save their lives, but the scorching guitars and adrenalin fly through the air like sweat beads at a concert. Lead track ""Thunderstruck"" features some of Angus Young's best lead-guitar work ever, ""Moneytalks"" is memorable radio metal, and ""Are You Ready"" does what AC/DC does best -- fist-pumping party anthems with lean, mean guitars and attitude."
3,THE MOST AUTHENTIC BAND OF ALL TIMES !,"Let's see how AC/DC is a stone of continuity, never changing: 1)Angus always played with school uniform; 2) Malcolm never did a solo, even live; 3) Malcolm and WIlliams never played walking through stage, only stand at each side of Phil Rudd's drums, 4) They never jammed with someone; 5) they never absolutely recorded anything accoustic in their songs 6) they always played with jeans 7) they never tried to add keyboards; 8) they never tried to write intelligent lyrics. But they are great."
4,They bring a couple of tunes that are strong as ever,"Not sure if a comeback album as some say, but they deliver a strong performance here with some strong tunes that stand out as hits in the AC/DC genre."
4,RAZOR'S EEEEDGE!..,"I really like RAZOR'S EDGE, the best album since FLICK OF THE SWITCH...All the songs rocks with a kind of poppier sound, but still heavy and true! The huge hit THUNDERSTRUCK, RAZOR'S EDGE, ROCK YOUR HEART OUT and SHOT OF LOVE are good rockers!!!"
5,Is The Remaster Worth It?,"I owned the original recording and didn't like it much due to the lack of sonic quality. I was very, very surprised when I listened to the Remastered version. It's like I never knew the album at all! Now, this title is one of my favorite AC/CD titles!Believe me, you won't be disappointed! Buy again even if you own the original-You'll rediscover it all over again!"
4,Couple of good songs,"This album had a couple of good songs. ""Thunder Struck"" being the best of the bunch. I still prefer the older songs that had some real heart."
3,Slightly Overrated,"This is one of the best Brian Johnson discs, (probably fourth overall) but about 50% of it is filler, AC/DC at their repetitive worst. Get ""Blow Up Your Video"" and ""For Those About to Rock"" first."
5,O M G !!!,OH My God !!! I thought I would never get here. I just can't believe that Anyone has Any use for the imitations that you gotta wade through to get to the REAL band. I wanna vomit it makes me so sick to listen to cheap substitutes to this legacy of rock. I don't have anything against these people personally but STOP IT! Only people from a later generation would consider these bands at all and bottom line the tribute bands just don't have the meaty depth of the original AC/DC !!!!
3,Bought the album for one or two songs,"I bought this album for Moneytalks and Thunderstruck. Usually on AC/DC albums, I buy the CD for one or two songs and warm to the other songs over time -- eventually learning to love the whole album. I've had it for several months now, and just can't get into the rest of the songs. They all sound the same and most are in the same key. I know AC/DC thrives on using the same sound, but they usually make it a little more interesting than this. About half of the songs lack the hooks and power chords they're famous for. Fantastic album if you're not looking for anything earth shattering aside from the aforementioned songs. Of course, that's just my opinion."
3,Are these measuring cups or cast iron skillets?,"I can't deny that these measuring cups are indestructible. In fact, I'm pretty sure I could make scrambled eggs in the largest one.Pros:Truly very beautiful.The weight feels good in my hands.You can rest easy knowing that they will survive any nuclear war, and your great-great-great grandchildren will use them and praise your name.Cons:They're very wide and shallow. Like frying pans. Unfortunately, this one con was a dealbreaker. They couldn't fit into my flour bins, and I felt like the design made them difficult even to scoop flour out of the bag (and who needs that process to be even *more* messy, really?). I was really excited to get these, and it hurt me to return them."
2,JUNK! I and now i'm going to return them which is a pain for a $20 product.,"Okay, I was expecting something that seemed precision and quality - not JUST thicker steel. they look like they were stamped with very poor quality control. there's a scribed 1/2 full line on the insides of the cups that's smeared looking and misaligned. the stamps are crooked so good luck figuring out where 1/2 full is. Are they functional - sure, but so is a $3 set. I didn't spend $20 for a 'functional' set I spent $20 for a NICE set. the cylinder shape of a couple of them is crooked - again, misstamped or something. and the handles are ground down or shaped down to non-uniform thickness... ugh, I never do reviews, I was just so annoyed with these. I'm going to shop around and try and get another set - I'll try to remember and update this post of I come across something better. YUCK YUCK YUCK! annoyed!"
5,I Love these measuring cups,I like the engraved measurement on the handle and the 1/2 measure inside the cups so it doesn't wash off in time as with plastic measuring cups and I like the heavy weight so they sit flat on the counter. I do wish they had a pour spout for liquids.
3,"Sometimes, the movie is better...","I didn't dislike this book, but I think it was brought down a little by having seen the movie based on the book. The movie is quite different and I was continually expecting the storyline to gravitate towards the movie - it didn't really. I loved the movie, just liked the book."
1,"Blah,blah, blah, blah....","What can I say about this novel? I thought it would be an interesting tale about disenchanted youths dealing with post-grunge depression. Instead, I was introduced to a handful of pitiful characters with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I would rather read about people's ""glory days"" than about a bunch of hateful teenagers with nothing to look forward to. Honestly, I didn't finish this book. 50 pages was all I could take. So, I can't make any profound reviews of this book as I read nothing profound at all throughout the pages. You'd be better off renting the ""Kurt and Courtney"" documentary!"
3,Novella is the the best in the book,"If you pick up The Ring of Brightest Angels Around Heaven, be sure to at least read the novella (same name) at the end if you decide you're giving up on the book as a whole. I really liked the first story in the collection, but everything else wasn't that interesting to me. I would find my mind wandering as I was reading the other stories, and I would go back and re-read. The only time this didn't happen was with the novella, which is about different slackers, but it was still interesting. If you read the bibliography at the end and the footnotes, you'll understand where Rick Moody is coming from in the novella to some extent. Not too far from his own experiences. I actually thought reading the footnotes was more interesting than most of the short stories. The booke definitely doesn't hinder me from reading more from Moody, however. At least it's worth a try."
1,ditto to the reader from Miss.,"So my favorites are Thom Jones, Denis Johnson, George Saunders, Rick Bass, and the like. Someone said ""Oh you should check out Moody"". In a word, this book was slow. I found it hard to care about and the only thing that moved me was trying to see if more would be written about the guitarist's leather pants. It seemed like it was trying to do what Jesus' Son nailed to the wall- contempory non-beautiful people down to Earth honest to God in your face fictional realism. It didn't make it. I hesitate to read Ice Storm."
4,"This is New Jersey, alright","The author writes well, indeed, but of a generation that may not be the reader's. At that point, the book becomes uninteresting. It seems that it took the characters in this book until 1990 to catch up with the 1960's. I don't believe that this book should have been re-issued; it is (out)dated."
5,So romantic in all senses of the word,"I really liked these books. The stories are so well told. I could really get a feel for what the characters were like. I love reading about a romance from the point of view of the man because men are so often stereotyped as not showing as much emotion and such. Reading this really shows you how much they often do care, even when it's difficult for them to show it. And that just makes my heart melt."
4,Cherrfully Funny!,"Cheerfully cheesy fun is guaranteed in this sexy, melodramatic soap opera about what happens to a Latino pretty Boy whose hormones go in to overdrive, when his goodlooking cousin Angel arrives for an extended stay. Not the best movie, but it does have some great laughs, and at times it seems a bit crazy, it makes up with the great story that seems to captivate you, and dares to go where those few movies are willing to take you. Check it out it, you will have a good time!"
2,Latin Boys Go to Hell,"amateur, and the cast isn't that good-looking; but I got sucked in by the title and front cover anyway. Sorry I bought it. Would rather a sweet, gay romance than the violence and craziness of this flix.- Bruce"
1,Horrible all around!!,"The acting is horrible, the movie is stupid, and the cinematography looks cheap!!! This is what happens when you buy a DVD just cause the guy on the cover is hot. Avoid this junk at all costs. I would give it zero stars if I could. Absolute TRASH!!!!"
1,1.5 stars,"Don't get me wrong, I love basically everything else Mick Barr does or has done. However, I can't listen to this album. It is one 33 min song, with three seconds of insanely fast guitar, and then four seconds of the same feedback, over and over. The guitar work is awesome, but because the repetitive feedback interrupts so often, its basically the only thing I hear. I wish I could edit out the feedback, the the other reviewer did, then I would enjoy the cd. Check out Mick Barr's other projects, especially Ocrilim."
3,Don't Judge The Book By It's Cover,"The cover of this book does it ""NO"" justice. I picked this up but wasn't expecting much based on the cover and the title, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very good and well written love story. This was a first for me by the author but definately not the last. Pick this one up you won't be disappointed, just ignore the cover."
4,A Direct Hit,"Rio Clark is a pimp by blood, not relation. Following in the footsteps of his father, uncle and grandfather, Rio juggles multiple lovers. Stick and move. Move and stick. Secretly Rio is tiring of the parade of women. Maybe it's time to settle down and find Ms. Right.Carmen Massey has been hurt before and has no time for a man with a player's mentality. She's not looking for sex, but rather a meaningful relationship.Several chance meetings place Rio and Carmen in each others path. Is Carmen Rio's Ms. Right? Is Rio a man Carmen can share her life with?Dyme Hit List was an engrossing read from start to finish. Curtis Alcutt effectively makes his characters come alive to readers as you anxiously turn the pages waiting to see how the drama will unfold. Dyme Hit List hits its intended target."
4,Dyme is a 9.4,This book was very realistic in the language and the storyline. Great read. I couldn't put it down! They should make a movie out of it!!!
5,"An ""erotica"" lovers dream","Dyme Hit List is awesome! It is not just another book full of erotic scenes. I laughed, got turned on, smiled, and even cried while reading this book. Curtis Alcutt is a top notch writer. I can't wait to read his next effort."
4,Great book to get you started...,"I finished a short book titled You Can Write For Magazines by Greg Daugherty. It is 124 pages of practical advice on how to turn your writing efforts into salable material for magazines. The book covers how to create ideas, how to write effective query letters to editors to sell those ideas, how manuscripts should be formatted, and so much more. When you get done with this book, you'll have an idea of what you need to do in order to start your career as a part-time freelance writer. If you've been writing already for publications or if you've read other books on this subject, you might not find an abundance of new material here. But the information you will find is concise and readable, so it's worth reviewing it again..."
3,Not enough info.,"Although this book can be helpful for beginning writers, it lacks in additional information. I have been reading several other books on magazine and freelance writing and many of them have the same information as this one. This book only gives basic information that the everyday writer can apply as common sense. What I could really use is a list of internet sources and websites or even useful names and addresses for resources on more information. This book doesn't provide any of that. However, I will keep it in my library of quick reference books to keep me positive and motivated when I suddenly feel the need to ""give up""."
3,4 Star Soul Funk Revival,"What?! No one's reviewed this yet. Welllll, let me step in and change that. This is some hellified raw soul/funk that I tripped over when Tower Records was still in bidness; God Bless those listening stations (moment of silence).From the opening track *Problems* you can tell this is going to be awesome. The next track is a nice slow groove that reminds me of my days sitting in Foxy's Playground in DC, watching the strippers do their thing.Those two and *Honey Dove* and *Googie* are my favorites. Although there are a lot of misses here in this two cd set, the hits are so dead on, its worth it.I originally put in 3 stars, by mistake but since I can't amend it, I have to rate this joint a solid B (4 stars).I'm not a critic so I can't extrapolate the intricacies of the sound, but I will simply tell if you take this gem home, like I did, and put it on, you'll be bobbing your head relentlessly and wishing you had a woman like Tina to come over and get a little *nice and rough*."
1,Junk,"My first drive arrived damaged. I sent it back to the company and they sent me a ""repaired"" drive. It last 2 months before it too died. BEWARE! This drive is junk. You've been warned."
5,A pleasure to read,"You wouldn't think that a book designed to improve one's vocabulary would be a pleasure to read, but this one is. I bought the book because I have often considered ordering the (very expensive) audio program I always seem to see in airline magazines, but have never had the extra cash to spend on it. With it's levels, lists, and review tests, you'd think this book would be as boring as a high school vocab textbook, but it's not at all! Not only does he teach you new words (with precise, accurate definitions), but he throws in interesting tidbits on word history, correct but seldom used pronunciations, and some great anecdotes. I look forward to reading this book every time I open it."
2,Not as effective as you are led to believe!,"I took both the ""diagnostic"" pre-test and post-test, one right after another (without reading the book). I was curious to see if the author would be tempted to skew people's results by including an easier set of words into the post-test batch. I scored 46% correct in the pre-test, and 78% in the post-test (not counting those words that appeared in both tests). I'm very skeptical that I would get such a divergence in scores if the words in the post-test weren't just easier.The book itself seems to be pretty informative (just reading it now), but I still think it's sleazy to try to stack the cards in your favour like the author has done in this case."
4,Great starting point....,I am not one that usually buys books like this but I thought it mught be interesting. This book was much harder and more intense than I had thought it would be. I knew that I did not have an exceptional vocabulary but I did not think it was average. This book proved me wrong. The book has a great layout and works through the words in a progressive manor. With I little time you can improve immensely. Good luck.
5,Finally! Real World Applications for Algebra!,"I am a high school special education/alternative education teacher in Oregon, working with special needs youngsters. Contemporary's ""Number Power 3: Algebra the Real World of Adult Math"" by Bob Mitchell offers the teacher and students real life applications for algebra. And, as a bonus, the pages in this worksheet format booklet are laid out clearly, very clearly, and are easy for the student to negotiate. The worksheets give plenty and frequent opportunity for the student to respond. The students find the book engaging.After a teacher and students uses this workbook, I doubt they will ever return to the old-fashioned, stodgy, irrelevant, hard-bound and boring algebra text books that are so common in most public schools today.A breath of fresh air--I recommend ""Number Power 3: Algebra the Real World of Adult Math"" without reservation!-John Bain"
1,"Avoid this unauthorized Gucci bag.... it just screams ""FAKE""","Stick to buying Gucci bags at Gucci stores, or from stores like Neiman Marcus, where you know you'll get an original. Don't risk buying a fake here, which will only fall apart and make you look foolish."
2,Looks Cheap,"My niece wanted this bag, looking at it did not help her quest.Inspecting this bag didn't help either. It is an EYE SORE.Because I know good, high quality leather goods,being Italian born, my niece finally agreed it was just plain SCRAPPY and was very contented with a 9 West bag."
5,Great book!,"If You Only Knew is so far the best book out of the Sweet Valley Senior Year Series. Jessica and Jeremy are perfect together, and Liz and Conner are great together. Melissa is a really cruel person, and I think that Will should really ditch her. GREAT BOOK!"
5,It was absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!,"After I began reading these, i got hooked. I didn't even know when the first one came out, and it looked kind of ugly on the cover so I didn't bother buying it. But after I read the first book..........I was hooked!!!!!!! I read all of the first four books in one day!!!!!!!!! I love them It talks about real teenager issues, not just about their fake lives. I can't even go back to the old books. These books will definetly get you hooked. I got all my friends hooked, which is odd, 'cause they never read anything I do. It's soooooooooooo good!!!!!"
5,it gets better every time!,i love this book! we finally find out what happenes to connor and elizabeth. i just wish jeremy and jessica would come out and tell each other what their secrets are. i hope they stay together. they would make the perfect couple.
3,awesome book,"this book was good. no, awesome! anyway, it was really good book. i'm evil i guess since i've always wanted will and jessica to be a couple. and jeremy out of the pixture! liz and conner either get together or not! these are getting crazier and crazier. i hope they get better and better"
5,"Meticulous, fascinating","Silver has done an outstanding job researching and synthesizing this. Highly recommended for anyone interested in fairies, Victorians, or western culture and history."
3,"More of a sociology book than a book about ""Strange & Secret People""","I bought this book as an additional tool for my ""elf"" and ""fairy"" research. Out of all the books I have read and taken notes from, for that purpose, this book has been the least useful in acquiring information about the nature and characteristics of those otherworldly beings. I found this book to be more of a sociological text concerning ""fairy mythology in comparison to victorian social issues"" than anything. It is a well researched book and provides many names of authors, researchers, book titles, and other useful information for my purposes, but it falls very short in providing the information I am after."
2,bad copy,"not what I expected.I had the original befor and some parts are gone and the sound quality is verry poor.No, not if the other copies play like this one."
5,Best AC/DC Concert DVD I've ever seen!,"I own Live At Donnington and No Bull, and I've got to say this is the best AC/DC performance I've seen, with the hits we all love, and the classics some of us may have forgotten, AC/DC puts it all out there in the best way possible. Video and Audio quality is amazing, and some say the camera changes too fast but I got used to it and think it made it better. This production ultimately shows that AC/DC is the greatest Rock N Roll experience money can buy, and that they can be considered the greatest band of all time. Must have for all fans of the band, and great introduction to folks who may not know as much about them. 5 out of 5!"
5,Restoring my faith!,"I was somewhat disappointed with the last live video from the boys (No Bull) but was blown away by this one. The digital sound is fantastic and the band is really tight. They sound great. Even You Shook Me All Night Long sounded good (I've never been impressed with that song live).I will agree with a previous reviwer that the bonus footage could have been better. What's there is good, but it's only 10 minutes long. I also like the song selection. Sure all the usual suspects are included but I love that they played What Do You Do For Money Honey and especially Up To My Neck In You. Thanks for keeping us on our toes guys.What the band really needs now is a DVD or 2 DVD set that contains footage and interviews from their entire career. There's got to be a TON of stuff out there that we rabid AC/DC fans would love to see. Oh well, maybe sometime down the road. For now, this one rocks. If you're a fan of the band I highly recommend it."
2,I've seen better...,"I'm a huge AC/DC fan and i'd have to say... I'm not all that impressed with this DVD. The sound is great but the performance they chose to use wasn't the best. I originally thought that this DVD would be the best performances of the whole stiff upper lip tour compiled into the one DVD but it was only one single show. I saw them during this tour at the Continental Airlines Arena and that show was 10 times better than what is on the DVD. I think the reason why they chose it was becuase of it being a huge venue and a sold out crowd. The behind the scenes extra footage wasn't all that great either... just a quick 10 minute or so interview with only about 2 minutes of talking. If you have money to burn and want to check it out, it won't be the most dissapointing thing in the world... Probably just not as much as you expected."
4,The best AC/DC concert in the world!,"This concert rocks! It had great songs like 'HIGHWAY TO HELL', 'BACK IN BLACK', AND 'HELL'S BELLS'. It was a great concert but it would be better if Bon Scott was the singer instead of Brian Johnson. But great show, great fans. It was so good I pooped. In my pants. They opened obviously with 'STIFF UPPER LIP' and they closed with 'FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK' and they did an encore with 'SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES'. HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!"
5,great,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CONCERT DVD I HAVE EVER SEEN.THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE ENERGY THAT THE BAND IS ABLE TO PUT ACROSS IN THIS DVD.IT IS A VERY TIGHT PROFORMANCE.I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE AC/DC,BUT MUST ADMIT TO BEING MORE OF A BON SCOTT FAN THAN BRIAN JOHNSON,BUT THIS DVD ROCKS.IF YOUR INTO GREAT HARD DRIVING ROCK N ROLL,YOU`LL LOVE THIS."
4,"Huge production,Great stage performance!","Well, For all hard rock fans...the music is great,Picture and sound are fabulous...but Brian's voice is not half as good as it was before...just listen to 'Back in Black' from the Donington Live and then listen to this one,you'll know What I mean.Overall this is a good concert.Just don't get too critical about it..."
3,The trouble is Brian Johnson's voice.....,"Johnson has absolutely nothing to prove... He's part of AC/DC, he contributed decisively to the band's fortunes, he's good humored, a real fine singer, a great guy.But the trouble is that all those years delivering that thunderous, unique and marvellous lead vocals made Brian pay the price...Nowadays, his singing is just annoying. AC/DC can get away with that because their live act is so good, so energetic, that Brian's part becomes just a by-side attraction, since most of the audience in an AC/DC concert know the songs by memory.But to watch the concert in the comfort of your house, it is getting harder and harder to listen to Brian...No amount of digital effects can disguise this fact...As for the band, it's competent and energetic as always."
2,poor editing,"well first off I bought this dvd based on other reviews thinking it was 4 1/2 stars, I couldnt go wrong, right?wrong, this dvd is horrible the camera work shifts like a lightining storm, if you try to watch you will get dizzy,the sound is ok but the editing is just impossible to watch ,dont buy this one."
1,Please,"Can't they just keep the camera one moment on ANGUS, you see EVERYTHING exept the band playing they do the same thing at the ""NO BULL"" DVD they should change the CAMERA DIRECTOR. After 5 minutes you become confused.The DONNINGTON CONCERT is so wonderfull but it doesn't exist on DVD! WHY???????"
1,"Whatever Amazon says, it doesn't fit a 2005 Nissan Altima","If you have an '05 Nissan Altima (like me), don't get these. Amazon says they'll fit, but they won't. Save your money and go to your local auto parts store, where they know what fits your car (and they'll show you too) for about $10 less. These pads may, however, fit something like a Nissan Versa, or a large motorcycle. Not an Altima."
4,Good Concise Overview of Lorraine Campaigne,"This is a good crash course in the essentials of the Lorraine Campaigne, the ""who, what, where, when and how."" Unlike some books in the Osprey ""Campaign"" series, it is very readable. Unfortunately, like most books in this series, it is written in very broad strokes, without a lot of details to give the story some life and color. But the many photos and illustrations go a long way to compensate for this short-coming in the text, and anyway, what do you expect from a 65-page paperback? The maps are extremely helpful in understanding the tactical and strategic situation on the battlefield and in the sectors, but they sometimes take a while to parse out."
2,Virtually Useless,"The main problem with this is that the majority of the tasks it performs can just as easily be done using the Windows XP system tools or Help and Support center. Also, you could seriously harm your system if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Fails to detect spyware; Lavasoft's AdAware is much better. I suppose QuickClean would be fine if it were much cheaper, but it is definitely not worth the price."
3,Shape is correct but colors are not accurate,This product looks good but is definitely not the bright red color shown in the picture. I still like it in my tank and I like the shape of it.
3,"A comfortable amble, if that's what you want form these two works","Contrary to the label of this CD, I would call Wand's Pulcinella Suite a ""nearly live recording."" The reading runs in the opposite direction of what Stravinsky wanted--it is flabby, comfortable, and relaxed. Of the composer's unique wit little remains once it is filtered through Wand's totally German sensibility; he even manages to homogenize the sharp, crisp contrasts of sound in this delightful score. As for the Pathetique, which is the main event, Wand's NDR orchestra ambles along in the first movement without much sense of impending drama, much less tragedy. It's a respectable reading as rendered on a typical subscription concert anywhere, and adding the touchstone name of Gunter Wand doesn't make it come to life. Of course, what I find comfortable and unexciting strikes is fans as authoritative. I defy them to find much authority in this pleasant but unmemorable CD."
2,Just plain dopey,"I have a great capacity for the willing suspension of disbelief. But too many times I found myself thinking ""Oh, come on..."" I thought the plot twists were poorly thought out. That and the lame ending place this story in the ""just plain dopey"" category."
4,Unigue talent in describing lifes trivialities.,"This book starts slow. Actually the first 60% is slow. However, the authors sparkling talent for describing everday occurances and conversations pulls one through to an eventual rollercoaster ride of pure adventurious pleasure. A great find."
2,Like a hole in my wallet,"This was a moderatly entertaining and amusing book. The story keeps bogging down and the narrator isn't likable at all until she reveals her deep, dark secret. Like a lot of books about 20-30 somethings the protagonist's mother's death is used to show emotional depth. The characters are colorful and the book has a nice LA and Las Vegas flavor though. I was partially sold because this book has blurbs by Nick Hornby and George Pellecanos, two really good writers who don't feel the need to show off where they went to college in their dust jacket bios."
3,Pacing was off... plot made little sense,"This was a good book. Really it was. The characterization of the protagonist was excellent, as was the description and feel of the book. However, I didn't really like it that much. It started relatively slowly and hurtled toward a finish. The plot was twisted beyond belief, and not in an intelligent, interesting way. Instead, it was confusing."
2,great writing - draggy story,"I agree with the review from ""reader in your closet"" - this book started out very promising. Initially, I liked Jill, but soon found her antics tedious and boring. She ultimately is a very unlikable character and by the last 75 pages or so, I didn't much care what happened to her, the d&*M book or anyone else in the story. I think it was after the *torture* scene that I was like, Okay! enough already! So I really don't know what happened after that....On the otherhand, however, the writing is very good."
3,"breezy, entertaining and worth reading, but over-hyped","A very good first novel. If she puts out another like this, however, I don't think the media reviews will be as glowing. Media reviewers rightly recognize the challenges writers face with a first novel and give it critical leeway.I think all the comments about the plot being inane are misplaced. I think the author intended it to be inane. Why, I'm not quite sure, but I think it was deliberate. Perhaps its irrationality is supposed to be a reflection of the character's own irrationality in refusing to deal with her guilt over her mother's death.Unfortunately, the inane plot took over the novel. I wanted more character examination.Still a fun read, though."
2,What is the point?,"The beginning of this novel was mildly interesting but past page 100 I just didn't want to read anymore about our heroine. Dull, is the word I'm looking for. Want to read something funny with lots of action, read GOOD OMENS by Gaimon and Pratchett. Give your brain cells a break and pass on LIKE A HOLE..."
3,pretty ok for a first novel,"This author can't decide whether she is writing a realistic account of a girl struggling with the loss of her mother in a city filled with misfits or a completely fantastical murder mystery with unbelievable characters and a torturous ending. Personally, I would have liked her to forget about the goofy book, and the incredibly stupid people trying to get it, and concentrate on the real story. I enjoyed the author's unique view of LA and I liked Jill. If the author had spend more time developing Jill's friends, and less on the murderous actors (come on!) I would have finished the book. I am looking forward to her next book because I think she has great potential as an author."
4,"Like, a whole lot of fun.","Strange to read so many negative reviews for a book I liked so much. I'm a classic noir fan, and it's good to see the genre turned upsidedown, inside out, and back again by a wisecracking female protagonist. The main character's/narrator's take on the ""mean streets"" of Los Angeles is, for this lifelong Angelena, hillariously true-to life, capturing everyday details that so many other authors fail to ever mention. Jill is a prickly protagonist with a past that more than justifies her hard-drinking, detatched outlook on life, and the speed-of-light narration is laugh-out-loud funny. Like Los Angeles, herself, this book is one of those things you either love or hate. I like blinding hot days, air so thick you can chew it, and books that leave a taste of bitter laughter in your mouth long after you've set them back on your shelf. LA is my kind of town, and Banbury is my kind of writer. I only wish she'd write more."
3,Robbins. Good. Why?,"For the first third of the book, I was convinced that the author had read too many Tom Robbins novels before embarking on writing ""LIKE A HOLE . .."" Same style. For the remainder of the book, either I had either numbed to the Robbins-esque-ness of it all, or it was actually toned down.I liked the book. It was an enjoyable read -- but the ending was just . . . I don't really know . . . it was really no more unbelievable than the rest of the book, but it just left me kind of scratching my head.I'd recommend the book to someone looking for a fast easy read."
4,a good read for late nights,"A bit reliant on Gen-X/L.A. cliches, but entertaining nonetheless. Recommended if you're in the mood for a non-serious romp of mind candy."
2,I needed this book like ... well you know.,"I started this book with great anticipation after hearing many good things. I finished with with a ""That's all there is?"" Sorry, it read like it was meant to be filmed. The characters were all over and spread too thin. Where did the dwarf come from, what was his story? And what was the deal with the one glove? I didn't really like Jill and wanted to know more about the other characters. It left me with lots of questions unanswered. I love a good mystery but this was not one."
2,What's All the Fuss About?,"Fairly mediocre first novel, in which the plot revolves around the theft and retrieval of a inscribed first edition of a Jack London novel. The protagonist is a loner, slacker type working in a small LA used bookstore. Things go wacky when a dwarf sells her the Jack London, she sells it to a dealer, and a polite thug comes looking for it. She's sort of interesting as a character, but also fairly annoying. There's a few bits of nasty violence and some nice evocation of grimy America. Less convincing are the bits with the star Hollywood director. A more interesting and literary mystery involving the quest for rare books is The Club Dumas by Arturo Pérez-Reverte."
1,"obnoxious protagonists, unrealistic plot","With much anticipation I began reading this book on a recent vacation. I had never heard of Jen Banbury but was enticed when I read the first few pages in a bookstore. Alas, what a disappointment. Jill, the protagonist-if you can call her one, proved to be one of the most detestable main characters I have ever encountered. Her smart-aleck comments began to grate on me after about 20 pages and never stopped. The other characters were all one-dimensional idoits who constantly were outsmarted by Jill. As for the plot, it was simply illogical. Your time can be much better spent with an author like Nick Hornby, or for that matter going back to Jack London and reading the real thing."
3,Disappointing,"I had heard of this book, and was anxious to read it. It sounded great. I went to several bookstores and couldn't find it, so I checked it out from the library. The only reason I give the book any stars at all is because it deals with books, bookstores, and people who work in bookstores, 3 of my favorite things. The story jumped around quite a bit. All of a sudden she was going to be in a movie or something...I'm still trying to figure out where that came from-but not enough to reread any of this book. I am just grateful that I didn't spend any money on it."
1,"Promising Premise, But Horrible Novel","I really had high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, I was let down. Though the characters are somewhat interesting, the story is horribly plotted and the dialogue trite. Very overrated book. Not recommended at all. It was truly a struggle to finish."
4,Witty Stuff,"A good, quick read-- witty and never serious. Last 50 pages or so, tonally become inconsistent, formulaic and are a huge letdown. Worth checking out."
3,Love it but it didn't help.,I have neuropathy as the result of an accident. I followed this regimen for six months and noticed no difference.
3,exhaustive review of supplements for neuropathy,"There is an excellent forward by neurology professor, Laurence J. Kinsella, M.D., listing supplements, which enhance, and those that harm, nerve function. The author's introduction discusses the need for double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of supplements used for peripheral neuropathy, despite the economic barriers to pharmaceutical companies scientifically investigating these agents, which cannot be patent-protected. The author attempts to review the many vitamin and mineral substances that have been tried with PN. There is a section describing the ALADIN study of alpha lipoic acid with PN."
1,"Don""t WASTE your money!!","Book was not imformative, HUGE commercial for authur's product ~ I was disappointed ~ even had advertisement placed insidebook hawking authur's product ~ give me a break!"
1,Nope!,I didn't like this DVD at all not only was she hard to understand but I didn't like any of the moves the cheoergraphy was horrible.
4,Journalism Plot,"I started Conflicting Loyalties and could not put it down; it has an exciting journalism plot. The writing flowed smoothly because Caicedo included history of the area. The details of South Florida, Cuba, the newspaper, Miami Spanish language radio, all fit the story perfectly. The South Florida setting was used to build believable characters. The book is a ""really good read."""
2,Better but buggy,"Microsoft has made some real improvements over the horrible FrontPage series... but it's amazing how many bugs this thing has. I've been using it for a couple months now, and besides the fairly frequent hangs, it'll occasionally undo the changes you just made when you save, has difficulties pasting in from a Word document, and creates and absurd amount of junk CSS at the top of your page by default. I frankly don't need an entirely new CSS class if I want to bold and italicize one word on a page, yet it'll create one and throw it at the top, so if you do a lot of formatting, you'll have a mountain of junk CSS in your header. It does handle CSS a million times better than FrontPage which offered virtually no support, but it still has a LONG way to go and probably should've been subjected to a couple more months of Beta testing before this release."
1,What a step down from Frontpage!,"I'm very disappointed in the new Expression Web from Microsoft. I've been using it for several months now, and thought I needed a book because I was having trouble finding things (like the list of templates Front Page provided). It turns out that they were never there in the first place! This program has less than Front Page (its predecessor) and is much more complex to use. I might as well get with the professional web designers and switch to Dream Weaver. Boooooooo Microsoft!"
1,TRIAL VERSION,NO COA ON THE PACKAGEWEB REGISTRATION NUMBER DID NOT WORKTHEN KNEW IT WAS THE TRIAL VERSIONAZ SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THISNONSENSE AND WASTE OF TIME
1,Product not easy to work,"Is a most complicate software that I see in my life, the process to installation is not easy to understand, the manual is complicated, not received a good help when you contact customer support , I am not recommend this product, the CD came with some scratches."
4,a very good scanner for a nice price,"i gave this scanner 4/5 stars because i bought it used and didn't get the software it should include in the original packaging.the scanner is very fast (up to 45ppm on A4*grayscale) it have all the basic function for handling the image (autocrop,auto-deskew,auto-rotate)it has pre-defined configurations (which is like speed dial for many format scan)the scanner itself is pretty small and handy.very good product (for me it could been better if i had the software along with it)"
2,Poor quality,For the huge price I thought the quality of the material used in these wer very low.I expected a better grade of metal for the price.
4,Gets the job done.,I wish it had more measuring spoons to the set. Namely a 2 tsp measure. Other than that it's a good set. Handles curve to support spoon from falling over. Tips have slight curve cut easily into ingredients. Narrow bowl allows for scooping of spices from smaller containers. Easy to level off with a straight edge.
4,Like them,They take a little getting used to but work nicely. The are nice and heavy. Would be nice if they came with something to hold them together.
3,"Useful spoons, but measures are not accurate","These spoons are a great idea, and they fit beautifully into spice jars.However, after comparing the Amco tablespoon and teaspoon against my usual set, I have to conclude that the Amco set (at least the set sent to me)is not accurate. I only compared two of the spoons, but the Amco set measured out about 25-30% more spice than my usual set. (And I don't believe my old set to be inaccurate...when I used the Amco set to bake an old/reliable recipe, the results were disappointing...the spices overpowered the other ingredients--and not just to a matter of taste, but to a fault).That said, this Amco set is still very useful for digging spice out of jars and minimizing waste. I'll definitely use them for that purpose. But I will still need my usual set of measuring spoons to obtain correct amounts."
1,Measures Are Not Standard,"I noticed that the tablespoon is larger than an actual tablespoon and my other measuring set, so I tested with a dry ingredient and was right."
5,Love them,"My ex bought these two years ago and I just had to get them back!!!They work very well in spice pot and are very accurate! I tested mine against a kitchen aid measuring kit and everyone of them were right on cue as far as measure is concern...Just washed them by hands...if you have time to cook, you should have time to wash your precious tools (Knives,measuring tools etc...)They will last a lifetime!!!"
2,Arrived bent out of true.,"These arrived with the handles bent near the bowls of the spoons. While they were easy to straighten, a new item should be sold in better shape and packaged with greater care. The fact that they were easy to bend means the steel was not work hardened or may have been annealed after forming the spoons. Either way, that's not a good manufacturing process to make the best tools. As far as usability goes, these are better for solid measures, while a round measuring spoon would be better for liquids."
2,It doesn't work,"Unfortunately this book won't help you speak the language, even the simplest sentences, because the pronunciation guide is written in a very unclear and frustrating manner.Unlike some other Berlitz guides that I used in the past this one is good for one thing only - to show the necessary phrase in Thai script to the native and hope the script is not as mangled as their ""transcription"".The main reasons for confusion are:1. Wrong intonation marks (and believe me, that is important)2. Very strange choice of transcription signs for vowels. It bears no resemblance to actual Thai sounds. I think that IPA (International Phonetic Association) signs would be better with proper explanation.3. Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes...I cannot judge the correctness of the Thai script translations in the book, but the Thais themselves often laughed while reading the phrases I had shown them and I suspect the native script passages have even more mistakes than this horrible transcription..."
1,Tithing by T.D. Jakes,"THere is not a single verse in the New Testament teaching, encouraging, or commanding Christians to tithe. In Mat. 23:23 Jesus said tithing was a matter of the law. Abraham tithed ONE time in scripture. God promises His BLESSING on GIVING, not tithing. Supporting a Christian corporation is not God's plan, meeting the needs of His people is. Tithing CORRUPTS ministers who have NO scriptural example of living from tithes. Paul worked and he told the elders and ministers to do likewise. (Acts 20:33-34-55) This testimony is true, read your Bible. Maybe the ""Matter of love"" he refers to has more to do with money and lifestyle enjoyed by a huge number of corporate church ministers. By the way, can you name ONE pastor in the New Testament as being head or in charge of a local church?"
4,Pretty terrific,"A pretty terrific collection of Bobby Darin hits with an emphasis on the pop/rock corner of his versatile career. By no means definitive (and completely overshadowed by the ""As Long As I'm Singing"" boxed set), it nonetheless includes such treasures as ""Dream Lover,"" ""Things,"" and the best available version of Darin's self-penned ""Simple Song of Freedom,"" a ""protest"" song that ironically became the only hit single for folk singer Tim Hardin, the author of ""If I Were A Carpenter,"" Darin's last major hit single which is also included here. The accompanying booklet with background on each of the songs and an insightful overview of Darin's career adds to the pleasures of this collection."
5,Great CD,"The CD has many great songs, especially I like Dream lover, Splish splash and You must have been a beautiful baby."
4,Nostalgic,You are either a fan or not. I just happen to like some of his music. It's more the particular songs that I'm after.
3,It's Okay ...,"Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a ""clean"" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it. We do NOT recommend this particular coffee."
5,Makes for good memories,"My dad used to buy Jamaica blue mountain when I was a little girl. He got sick not too long ago and was in a coma for a while. When he woke up, I had to go back home, but I sent him a care package for when he got home. This was in there. Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it! He had a heart attack a few months later and died, but I'm grateful I was able to remind him of one more good memory before he passed. I wasn't able to try it, but my mom still raves at how great it was, and how much my dad liked it."
3,Be aware of this produce,"The coffee does have a production date and best/use by date. Maybe I am the only one, but my purchase came back as quite close to the use by date, so just be careful. The coffee is good."
1,Not worth it.,This coffee tastes like any other. I highly doubt it is even Jamacain Blue Mountain since it doesn't have that distinct taste. Save your money.
1,Old merchandise,"I purchased this coffee for my mother for Mother's Day and she called to tell me the beans were old and dry, there was no aroma and when she attempted to make a pot of coffee, it had absolutely no taste at all. If I could rate it at ZERO stars, I would."
1,tree bark taste better so OLD.........,I've worked in a few Coffee houses and this is the worst crap I've come a crossed. It taste like tree bark ...their is no coffee oil left in this CRAP..............JUST buy Folgers before you buy this blue mountain crap coffee..I wish I could get my $$$$$ back don't EVEN BUY>>>>>>>>>>>>> -1 vote
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee. I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get. Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price.
1,HIGH HIGH SHIPPING COST! BEWARE!!!!1,I can not beleive that Amazon allows a company to charge $4.13 for EACH item ordered! An item that cost $2.20 and weighs less than 2.4 ounces each and charged $4.13 for everyone one ordered - and they put them in the same box???? RIP OFF!!!!
3,For die-hard Bad Company fans only,"Worn and overused lyrics, but nice acoustic guitar work by Mick Ralphs, Dave ""Bucket"" Colwell, and Terry Thomas. Briane Howe and Simon Kirke can't replace Paul Rodgers as lead singer! Gimme that good 'ol Bad Company."
3,More and more diluted...,"This is Bad Co.mk.2 running out of ideas since this record is a simplified vesion of the previous one.Few tunes stand out,but not enough to save this album from being too repetitive.The most accomplished album that Howe and company put out was their second effort,'Dangerous Age'(1988)which might just be one of the best and harder rocking Bad Co.records ever.Definitely,this is not the one!"
3,Average overall--VERY weak for Bad Company,"Obviously, I like the Paul Rogers-led version of the band better than the Brian Howe-led version. Nonetheless, I did enjoy ""Holy Water"" when it came out. This effort, however, leaves much to be desired. ""Stranger Than Fiction"", ""How About That"", and the power ballad ""This Could Be The One"" are what raises this effort even as high as 3 stars. The rest of the songs are quite unmemorable and flat. It sounds like Brian is more concerned with being a pop singer than being part of a rock band. Not enough rock and absolutely no fresh ideas on this one. No wonder I sold it back after owning it for a couple of years."
4,"Extraordinary story, good writing","Extraordinary true-life story of a German soldier (""Clemens Forell"") who makes a three-year, 8,000 mile escape from a Soviet Union labor camp. Worthy of five stars but for two minor complaints:1) The story is written through Josef Bauer, not the soldier himself. Still, Mr. Bauer does a respectable job.2) This book is an English translation from the original German text. While the translation flows well, it is difficult to assess what may be lost in the translation."
4,A pretty good read,"I recently finished this book, and I found it pretty good, overall.Yes, it lacked in some detail, especially towards the end. The ending felt a bit rushed, considering the time that was spent on the ""reindeer wranglers,"" and the ""gold miners."" I felt the book could have been a bit more balanced.Also, what happened to our protagonist after his escape?? Did he reunite with his family? Did he settle in OK? I wish those questions would have been addressed as well.Ah, well...perhaps in a future edition, they will be addressed."
4,As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me,Epic story. The ending left me wondering what happened after his return and more about how he was affected phsycologically.
5,Exceeded my Expectations,A tremendous film that attempts to capture the trek made by those rounded up during Stalins collectivazation. I dont think there are any other movies that are so emotional and hard hitting as this that deals with the gulags. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
4,fortitude,"this is a true account which I purchased after reading The Long Walk. This book is similar but as triumphant a story, but never the less was a very good read. This poor man wanders through the siberian forests having escaped from a gulag, he is rescued in turn by very bad people and very good people. He hoodwinks authority and overcomes great physical adversity and in the end manages to get back to the land of his birth."
3,good book but not a real story,"It is a good book, it is not well balance as he only focus on his target to really march home after read 77% of the book.A quick research on the internet shows his real name and also shows he was released by the Russians in 1947,making the story impossible to be true. Anyway it is a good story"
3,Well told story but..,This book has been very well written however it finishes much to abruptly leaving the reader craving as much details that started the book. It almost feels like the writer got bored and wanted to finish up his work as quickly as possible. I very good book but a disappointing ending
3,"""The Long Walk"" is much better!","The book did keep my interest, but in my opinion ""The Long Walk,"" which is a book with a very similiar story is far superior. If you have an interest in true-life adventure, then read ""The Long Walk."""
3,An interesting post WWII book concerning treatment by the former USSR of German and other POW's...,"Kept your interest, but lacked much detail in respect to most persons encountered. It felt at times like an over-stated personal travel log. No matter how I tried, I found the main protagonist a person that may have a problem with actual facts concerning his ordeal. Somewhere during the telling the truth might have been lost in fact or translation. Overall, a good read nonetheless..."
3,"OKAY, I GUESS.",Interesting story farely well written. This is the story of an epic journey and really only covers about half. This book would have to be twice as long to cover the entire story.
4,"Great story, worthwhile read.","While reading, I couldn't help but think; no matter how bad times have been thay pail in comparision to this mans. After reading I had an interesting talk with a fell soldier. I had stated that I found it hard to not feel sorry for the man, and that I had to stop and remined myself that he was a Nazi and earned his punishment. My comrade said something that will stick with me, and I think is worth mention. He said, not to view this man as a Nazi but as a Patriot of his country, just like all soldiers he didn't make the polices of his governmet, but he felt the need to fight for the cause of his country. It made me think long and hard about the way I veiw my enemy combatants and the treatment of prisoners of war. And the great injustice that soldiers pay the heavest price of war.A very good book that I had trouble puting down and was disapointed at how abruptly it ended."
3,"Martin's Review About ""Kerosene"" The Book","This is for 14 and up. The is about a kid upsest woth five. Cal has a good friend named Joel. At first he does'nt trust anyone but later on the book he starts trusting more. So basically its about is all about how to gain trust and not to give it out ramdomly. But later on the book Cal burns down the school. This explain how to give trust and how it works. In the book Cal (the main character) ends up giving Abby's his trust, so she earns Cal trust. I liked this book because it shows what teenagers go trough. It shows we are not the only ones who go trough ""Thuis also shows how real friends are; in one of the themes Cal and Joel are being chased by some people and have to cross the trsin traks and Joel ends up saving Cal. When Cal was crossing he was looking sraight at the train. Like evrything all the memories went right pass him and Joel had to pull him away to save him. I do recomend this book to people because it get your attention."
2,"How Does This Stuff Get Published, Anyway?","Sorry to say that this book is possibly the worst I've ever read. About your typical depressed teen dealing with your typical depressive issues. How does this one handle them? By setting things on fire! Well, it is a (relatively) new concept, but who wants to read a book about an arsenist?Perhaps PUSH is simply not the series for me. While Cut (by Patricia McCormick) wasn't half bad, it wasn't half good either. Perhaps they aim to the overly troubled and depressed masses- but what help could this book offer to an arsenist? (About as much as Cut offers to cutters.)"
4,A reader,Kerosene is a book that tells about dealing with life in the wrong way. Of course its about a pyromaniac. A little differernt but a good read.
3,"JOSEPH H. LEWIS, OPUS 36",Curious little western that tells what happened at Fort Lincoln a few days after Little Big Horn massacre (note the Lewisesque circular travelling of the inside of Fort Lincoln as Randolph Scott makes his appearance). Equally amazing is the role given to horses in 7th Cavalry. Recommended to Joseph H. Lewis completists or horsemeat amateurs.
4,pot rack,"The rack was strong and durable , got a new set of pans out of a drawer..in fact got two....was what i wanted.. for some reason did not get free sipping paid more for the racks than the pans.."
3,Doesn't fit my truck,"I have the lift recomended for this product, but it doesn't fit. I am going to have to really modify it to fit. Bummer. Nice looking piece, if I can get it mounted without butchering it. Them's the breaks of mail ordering something like this."
1,Ape fans beware!,"This book is absolute garbage. It is poorly written, filled with factual errors and contains not a single photo from any of the films. As a matter of fact, it barely has any illustrations at all. For those looking for a great book about the Apes series, I recommend ""Planet Of The Apes Revisited""."
1,Boredom on the Planet of the Apes,"Here is an extremely pedestrian effort to jump on the inevitable Planet of the Apes bandwagon. This book features few photos and lists capsule plot summaries and trivia for each movie and TV series, including the animated TV show. Check out the quotes for ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes""--the author can't even produce the correct line of dialogue. Zira ""loathes"" bananas, she doesn't ""hate"" them. This is just a rehash of information that has been available for years in other much more enjoyable formats."
2,Planet of the Apes-an unofficial companion,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. I could not put it down although I have a few problems with it. The information was interesting for Apes fans but the author put too many of his opinions on what he felt was good or not good about the movie series. Just report and we'll decide. I particularly disagreed with his harsh criticism of James Franciscus as Brent in ""Beneath"". Also, a few inaccuracies:P.114-The Cheinco wastepaper basket has Aldo on it, not just a Gorilla Soldier. P.120-The new Apes cards are by Inkworks Card Co., not Rainbow Card Co.. P.151-Lew Ayres played Mandemus on ""Battle"", not ""Beneath"". My biggest complaint was chapter nine about other movies/t.v. shows with primates in them. WHO CARES! Having said all that, I am somewhat pleased I bought the book and (with some hesitation) recommend it to Apes fans as the ""Cliff Notes"" to the superior ""Planet of theapes Revisited"" book."
4,better than the reviews posted here,"This is a pithy book. In some ways I like this better than the other, bigger book. It is less of a heavy read and seems to have more interesting facts. There ARE plenty of pictures (with captions---unlike the other Apes book!), none from the actual movie, but we've all seen it a 100 times anyway. These pictures are ones you haven't seen before. I didn't find the opinionated comments of the author distracting, I thought they were cogent."
4,A Great Planet of the Apes Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book and I surgest that you buy it.There are some things that I dont like about it though.First of all I do recommend that you do not read this book from cover to cover because it gets really boring.I recommend you pick out the things you like first.If you do read from cover to cover its like reading jotted down notes on 178 pages.The thing that I hate about it though is chapter 9 does not say anything about Planet of the Apes.The book is after all pretty good though.It goes over the movies,the two TV shows,the books, and more.It is a good guild for good Planet of the Apes facts.I highly recommend you buy this book.Its great!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Will it be updated for Sammy Sosa?,"It was awfully coincidental that this type of book comes out in the same year when Sammy Sosa has probably the most productive season in modern Cub history. I was puzzled as to how the authors came up with such determinations as ""fielding runs prevented""...which tended to bolster the statistics of many old-time Cubs. I think the most valuable aspect of this book is the insight it lends; the authors point out that statistics alone do not make a good season. They pointed out that players such as Bill Nicholson were more valuable in years where their statistics were not as impressive as other years. Other factors, such as league strength and the strength of the rest of the lineup must be considered when determining the value of a ballplayer's stats. A must read for true Cub fans...I'm not sure anyone else besides true baseball junkies would find much enjoyment in this book."
2,e for effort,"The Porter book is good, but it centers MOSTLY on the comics. Our family prefers the Batman Toy and Collectibles Price Guide by John L. Mack which has much better coverage of Batman collectibles, is up-to-date and has NEW Batman toys in it with MODERN pricing. The publisher of Porter's book should do John Macks'! E-mail him at: batboy@azstarnet.com I'm sure he'd love to hear from you"
4,Nice knife,"I like this knife, it's the 2nd Xtimer I've purchused in 4 or 5 years. X frame is cool design, Shrade quality, what more could you want?"
1,Not the best,This Wagon Train was only two episodes and two of the worst episodes.It wasn't worth the $15.00 I should've bought a season and paid more.
1,this isn't what you really want,"i wish i'd read the preceding review before i bought this CD. i thought i'd found a treasure with all of these great old school jams on it, but i didn't realize that the original artists weren't recorded on these disks. what a disappointment!! who in their right mind would redo a classic by grandmaster flash & the furious 5?? or run dmc?? it's like they tried to sound like the original artists, but totally missed the boat. this is garbage. don't buy it. if i could've rated it lower than a ""1"" i would have."
2,Not my favorite,"I was not particularly fond of this book. Although it did have a few points of interest, I found it somewhat condescending and biased. I had a hard time finishing it."
1,Terrible advice,"After reading the reviews posted by other parents, I bought this book hoping for some sound advice on discipline techniques for my 22 month old. I was astounded by the methods that Dr. Green suggests. His advice for the majority of situations is to ""smack"" the child. This is exactly what I am trying to avoid in disciplining my child. And his advice for keeping your child in his/her room when put to bed or sent to time-out is to tie one end of a rope around the door handle and tie the other end to something else so the door will only open slightly. Is that supposed to be professional advice?? That sounds almost abusive to me.In addition to what I consider poor advice, the book was written in the 1980's and seems a little out of date in several instances.If you are considering this book and are looking for alternatives to smacking your child or tying them in their rooms, I suggest you look for another book."
1,Appalling advice catering to the lowest common denominator,"If you believe in timeout, spanking, tying your child's bedroom door closed so s/he can't get out, sedating your child to get him to sleep or making your child cry himself to sleep, then THIS is the book for you. This book ridicules parents who opt for non mainstream approaches to parenting and basically advocates a ""whatever works best for you is fine"" approach to parenting. No wonder so many people like it, as it vindicates pracically ALL parenting practices and grants absolution for lousy or damaging parenting practices. Why isn't there an option for NO stars?2 thumbs waaaaay down."
5,One pediatrician's opinion,"As a pediatrician and a parent of three children, I can't say enough good about this book. The advice is simple and practical, the behavioral hints are valuable, and while Dr. Green endorses limited corporal punishment, you don't have to agree with him to benefit from this book. I also appreciated the gentle humor.This is not a book that worships at the altar of childhood. It is one that depicts childhood as being an interim state on the way to adulthood. The child has to grow and learn, and the parents have to teach. Pretending otherwise, as too many ""child development"" books do, does everyone a disservice.Especially for difficult children, I also like the fact that Dr. Green recognizes the different ways that parents may have to cope. Some children are naturally less tractable than others. But even severely developmentally delayed children benefit from simple, humane parenting. This book was a useful guide."
5,Great stuff,"I have to disagree strongly with Khan in his 2000 review. The performance (which I have seen live in New York four times) is remarkable in every way, and if you really want to hear every note Wagner wrote (read that as I followed the score while watching the video), THIS is the video to have. Regarding Khan's review, this is the Metropolitan Opera, NOT the NY Philharmonic. Secondly, Wagner is NOT Sturm und Drang. This designation is given to the Classical period of German lierature, NOT the Late Romantic period in music. I would find this reviewer more credible if he knew what he was talking about, but clearly he doesn't...."
4,Best Video Production,"This is probably the best video version of Gotterdammerung out there. The singers and orchestra are all fine. However, after hearing the Solti and Barenboim Gotterdammerung, this video is somewhat bland in comparison, so I rarely watch it now.If you are new to the ring, start here, but otherwise go with an audio performance."
2,An uninspiring production,"It's on the whole a boring production. I don't mind the rather conservative scenary, which, in fact is quite good. However, the whole thing is uninpiringly directed. The singers are just adequate. Jerusalem is mediocre and Behrens, I'm afraid, has insufficient voice for Brunnhilde. Ultimately, the Met's orchestra under Levine saves the day. But on the whole, it's still rather unsatisfactory."
3,Twilight of the gods,"This is the fourth and final opera in Wagner's ""Ring"" series which revolves aroung the golden ring of the Nibelung____supposedly a source of ultimate world power . I found this effort by the NY philharmonic under James Levine rather stilted and leaden . Hildegard Behrens gives a competent performance but has hardly the true ""Nordic"" looks to give that extra oomph to the ambience of the opera____one can only wish that some day Brunnhilde will be played by a true nordic beauty (a Caudia Schiffer lookalike will be perfect!) with a voice to match . Siegfried Jerusalem's Siegfried is ineffectual and anemic.The only actor who excells in his role is Matti Salminen : his Hagen is perfect .The set design is o.k but the final self-immolation scene of Brunnhilde is laughable ___just a series of firecrackers and cheap lightening ! Hardly the stuff of Wagnerian Sturm und drang ."
1,Would not buy any of his books,"I have not read this one specifically, but I attempted to read his first book after it was published. A friend worked with him & brought it to me to look at. I could find an error on every page in the book. Mostly, the errors were grammatical, as English is not his first language, but there were also medication-based errors as well. These were quite serious and would lead a test taker to get an answer wrong. Manan was not phased by the errors and just asked me to make all the corrections for him. I actually started to do this, but about 1/4 of the way through, I gave up because I felt as if I had re-written the book for him."
4,A good review guide for Pharmacy tech exam,I have just appeared for pharmacy tech exam. This book was quite helpful for facing ptce exam. Questions patterne in this book reflects an actual PTCE exam. I am waiting for my result. Hopefully I will pass. Good luck to you all who are sitting for the exam.
4,A nice book for PTCB exam,I passed my pharmacy technician certificate exam. I liked this book very much. This book has everything you need to pass PTCB exam. This book has a plenty information on drugs. The practice test of this book is simulated with PTCE examination questions. The calculations found on this book are carbon copies of calculation problems found in exam. Must check out !
4,Good printer but expensive cartridges,"I am on my second unit. After the warranty expires, the repair costs are high. I needed a transfer unit after 2 years and they wanted over $500.00 to repair it. Rather than repair it, I purchased another one on Amazon since I had about $400.00 of cartridges in the older unit. The cartridges are very expensive so I use my copy machine for draft printing and the Lexmark for the final product, so I suggest that you purchase an extended warranty for this printer which you can get from the manufacturer. Not related to the printer - I have had problems with about 20% of the lexmark cartridges leaking but so far Lexmark has replaced them. I guess I can't complain. It is my understanding (I could be wrong) that the cartridges that come with the original unit, are not filled to capacity."
4,Great Practical Information,"This video is largely a collection of interviews with a couple dozen folks who have hiked the entire trail. Each hiker is given as much time as they need to discuss a wide variety of topics: finding and treating water, dealing with snow, resupply strategies, etc. It was fun getting to know the different hikers as they expounded on their experiences on the trail. Many of the interviewees go into great detail about how they dealt with the challenges of the trail. If you are planning on hiking all or part of the PCT this video would be a very valuable source.I greatly enjoyed the movie, but would like to offer some cautions. This is not really a travelogue sort of video. You will learn a lot about people's hikes, but the movie does not contain a start-to-finish account of anyone's journey. There are very few scenic shots from along the trail. Instead, this is a straightforward informational video designed to aid people in preparing to hike the PCT."
5,Super,I purchased this motor when it first came out several years ago & as usual when your first in line you become the proving ground. I had a lot of problems that were caused by Minn Kota issues that they have resolved. This is the only way to go if you are running a tiller outboard. I am a walleye fisherman & this motor is sweet.
1,beware,I have 3 pieces of this cookware and within 3 years all developed cracks to the point that they could not hold water . For the cost of these vessels they should last a lifetime...buy cast iron instead
1,I hate this pot,"When used on the stove top, this pot scorches its contents quicker than any type of cookware I have ever used. Even on the lowest setting on my simmer burner with nearly constant attention, it still scorches. Perhaps it performs better on an electric range, but it's a nightmare on gas.I have no problem with its performance as a Dutch oven. It is comparable to the romertopf I've been using for years. However, a romertopf is less than a third the price.I bought this pot because of its dual use. If I had known how poorly it performs on the stove top, I would have purchased a nice heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot instead, and stuck with the oven ware I already own. I think Emile Henry should stick to oven ware, as well."
1,I was happy with this pot until today.,"I was happy with this pot until today. I've had a little bit differently shaped pot by Emile Henry; it was in my kitchen for approximately 10 years, but I used it probably for three or four times. Today I was using it as I usually did - pot cracked during cooking on it's own. Manufacture has three years limited warranty only for price what they charge - it is outrages."
1,Retains cooking odors,"Buyer beware. I bought this pot based on it's great reviews and the first (and last) thing I made in it was spaghetti sauce. Afterward, the pot continued to smell like the sauce I made. I washed it numerous times and could not get rid of the smell. Needless to say, I returned it. I'll stick with the enameled cast iron from now on."
1,"i am being punk'd, right?","knowing that there is a rabid fanbase for cartoons/comics out there, i thought i would give the genre a try. i read a bit about the subject & found that the LOVE AND ROCKETS series is highly regarded by many comic fanatics. So i got this book, the 1st in the series, and came to the conclusion that the universe likes to play jokes on me. certainly, nobody could actually like this book! there is no way! a complete waste of time, it is. pure crap. I hate it, i hate it, i hate it!!!!!!!!!!! so anyway, that's my thoughts about my first foray into the comic book genre. ick."
3,"Good points, makes you feel dumb and poor reading it.","The book has very good points, points I applied to the 10-something drafts of my application. The book reflects the seriousness you should be taking with the application process because, well, think of how much you care about your #1 choice and your last choice to attend. Some of it is a tad obvious, yes. But she focuses your point-of-view to make yourself look good to the only person that matters in this process: the application reader. Most of the book is learning by example; she highlights three students of hers (that paid nearly $30K for her services) and showed them what they did. It mostly works. I wouldnt rave about this book but it does the trick. And I got into the best school on the planet for my major. So I would say by a stack of these types of books, including this one, and assemble your own guidelines from them. It puts your mind in the right places."
2,more glitz than substance,"In a way, this book perfectly mirrors the author -- mostly flash with not that much substance. Although Cohen represents herself as ""having worked in the admissions office,"" at Yale, she did so as a VOLUNTEER reader, not as an admissions officer. I wonder why the media have not picked up on her lack of experience compared to other authors. On that experience and her Madonna-esqe publicity sense, she has based a thriving business which by all accounts she runs well. However, that does not make her an experienced admissions officer and it shows in the text. This book will of course give students some case studies to base their own applications on, but ultimately, it won't help all that much besides the many well-published facts it regurgitates about admissions. The style is breezy and readable although the book feels like a plug for her business. The best part of the book is the title."
2,Too focused on three individuals,I honestly was not helped by this book. It focused on the cases of three students which I found no relation to on any level. I have not found anyway to improve myself. I'm glad the author was able to help the kids she talked about in the book. But I'm me and I need help and this definately did not provide anything.I don't plan to go even apply for an Ivy League school so once again this book hasn't helped in that fact either.
1,Remind me again,"how I'm supposed to find anything relevant to MY situation in the advice given to three students, all of whose parents can presumably afford the $29,500 fee the author apparently charges the rich and credulous.Breezy title, breezy advice -- alas, I can't afford to be so breezy about my college applications. I have too much riding on this year to trust the facile assurances contained in this guide.I wish I could say I was able to glean even one useful nugget of information I could use or pass on to a friend; lamentably not.Back to my applications and vocabulary building."
5,"An ""opening"" by the translator...","...of the Taoist classic fables, all of which can be read as simple stories or wells of wisdom. I particularly like the tales of the Yellow Emperor."
4,Enjoyable Retelling,"One point that should be clarified about this book is that it is not a direct translation of Lieh Tzu. In the intro, the author explains that her goal was to ""open up"" the text for modern Western readers by essentially retelling the stories in her own way. This is a perfectly valid approach, of course, since she is open about it. In some cases, her renditions sharpen the point and even improve the literary quality of the original. In others, she may have reduced some quirkiness of the original in deference to political correctness, or may have added influences from later Taoist thought. This is a good edition to read for contemplation, but if you are interested in the history of Taoist thought at all, stick with A.C. Graham's more literal translation."
3,updated tripe,"This edition of the book is more up-to-date, so it's actually useful somewhat. Mostly, though, it's a book written by experts for experts. There is little thought given to the practical application of genealogy -- making friends with newly found relatives, for example, and family reunions. There is no mention of the politics that go into genealogy. You can easily destroy your family by writing the wrong date for a marriage on your descendant chart, but the book totally omits important facts like that! It has a small chapter on DNA, which is nice, but it leaves out critical information on that topic, too. The ""Idiot's"" title of this book is misleading; the authors fail to think like a layman. Beware."
4,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Genealogy,"As a newbie to genealogy, I find this to be a very helpful book. It points you in the directions that you should go and gives a lot of ideas that I would not have thought of."
5,Excelent!,This book is great. It has helped me trace my ancestry back more than ten generations and to four different countries. I recommend this book to any new or experienced genealogists!
4,Let's get started!,This is the book that can get you really involved in Genealogy. Easy to follow and full of information to point you in the right direction and to the right resources. The writing style makes it a fun read too. I get a lot of books from the library; but this one I purchased to keep at home because I found I checked it out so often. Good price and very helpful.
3,Cha-Ching!!!,"Mr. Nikki ""Gene Simmons wannabe"" Sixx will have dollar signs in his eyes after you buy this product. I always dug the Crue, but I see no real reason to buy this. They've already re-released all their CDs with takeouts and demos. The only thing you get new here is the original Lethur version of Too Fast for Love. I refuse to buy all these songs again. Sorry Nikki."
2,Too Smart To Fall For This... Too Smart To Fall...,"Here's my mega review:Look me up when you release Too Fast For Love: Leathur BY ITSELF for $15, then we'll all get together and have some laughs. As for this set, I guess it's just me whose laughing. Don't I already have 90% of this stuff on you know, the , uh, cd's I bought?? You remember those round things right? The things that have the cover art, and the lyrics sheets this DOESN'T have?"
1,Tasteless & Unforgivable...,"Just because it has been nearly 20 years since Razzle's death, that doesn't make it a joke. The title of this box set makes me sick... I actually like some of Motley's music, particularly the early stuff; but just because of their disgusting disrespect for the memory of Razzle I won't buy this. You shouldn't buy it either- buy the Hanoi Rocks box set instead. I was almost to the point where I could forgive & forget, but not now. Vince should have gone to prison...Dimestore Liam"
4,Essential for some....Useless for others,"I gave this a high rating because I never purchased all of the Crue releases on disc. It is absolutely essential if you do not own their discs on cd and especially if you do not have the remastered versions. As for the ""Leathur"" versions, do not buy this for that. They are very similar to the Too Fast.. versions and therefore not a reason to buy this set. I was also very disappointed with the booklet that is included. Not much thought or effort put into it at all. I was really looking forward to some great reading but it was not there. I was always a fan of the first 3 Crue disc and never really liked the others so I am not sure if I will pick up the other volumes. This one was definitely worth it for me though."
4,Mystery at Walt Disney World,Good reading for 4th-5th graders (any level) or good 3rd grade readers. Best if they have been to WDW.
4,Mystery at Walt Disney World,"Book arrived in good condition, but took quite a bit longer to arrive than normal. Overall, I am very satisfied."
1,Pretty horrible book,"This book was just so poorly written, it's hard to believe that there is a franchise for this series. It's a great idea...to incorporate real Disney (or Hershey, NYC, etc.) locales into the mystery, but why couldn't this story be more clever, interesting or exciting. It was so bland, predicatable, and corny. I wound up reading a lot of this to my son, who did enjoy it, but I was bored out of my mind. Any excitment that this book tried to introduce, I saw coming miles before. Simply awful. Also, shameless plugging for her merchandise. The kids in the book wear official ""Carole Marsh"" watches. Give me a break! The fact that one of the main characters in the book was named ""Mick"" after Mickey Mouse should tell you that this author lacks any sense of creativity or imagination. But, I have to admit, my son was disappointed every time I said we had finished a chapter and were done reading for the night. What can I say? The kid lacks taste."
5,The Night Before Christmas,"I've bought this gorgeous book for two of my grandaughters in the past. This year I bought one for myself. I love Mary Englebreit designs. Now I can read to the rest of my grandkids when they come over. Thanks , I'm very pleased."
3,Went wrong,"While this was a really nice looking book, I could have sworn it was supposed to be recordable and it is just a book. So for me it was a disappointment albeit my fault I guess."
3,The Night Before Christmas Recordable Story Book By Clement C. Moore,"Excellent book, delightful from cover to cover and the story is easily recordable HOWEVER this is a story that I purchased for my children to read at night when I am away in bed and it does not work with low lighting. Hold it up to the lightbulb and it will work, down low by their bed and the pages do not work at all. An unfortunate oversight by the manufacturers."
5,Great Illustrations,All my nieces and nephews and kids of friends have received this as a holiday gift from me. Many of them have told me it is their favorite book!
3,Little one's review not favorable,"Showed this book to our granddaughter, and got an immediate review of ""no."" I have a feeling that she might have felt the book to be too busy with all the colors and illustrations. Sometimes, less is more.I am going to try this book again next year and maybe by then she will take to it as she is only 2-1/2."
1,Not a recordable book,We typed in recordable childrens books and this one came up - we ordered 3 - dissapointed when we received!!!
5,Night Before Christmas,This is a beautiful book. The illustrations are lively and colorful. I am using this book as a baby gift. The family receiving the book can begin a tradition of reading this book on Chrstmas Eve.
4,I like the book,"However, this particular one was a gift for a friend of mine. I think it is a book that one should have on the bookshelf."
4,Welcome to DALBELLO World!,"This simple experimental album makes her uniquevoice attractive. Her expressions will reach youIntensely, Sensually, Intimately in the dark.This album is a kind of preview of her best album""SHE."" (this is also avairable Amazon.com)YOU CAN'T MISS IT!"
4,"Dark, primal and beautiful.","Wonderful album that has spawned several covers (from Heart to Queensryche). THe only problem with it is that it does show its age from time to time by feeling really 80's. Luckily, this is only occasional. Wonderful wonderful album."
2,"Interesting songwriter, otherwise ...?","My first contact with Lisa Dalbello came at the hands of Queensryche, who did an amazing cover of her song ""Gonna Get Close To You"" on their ""Rage For Order"" album. I picked up this CD mostly out of curiosity, for I had heard many others rave about her. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed. Dalbello clearly models herself on Kate Bush, right down to the alternately scream/whisper vocals. None of the songs flow very well, the lyrics are for the most part oh-angst-is-me streams of consciousness, and the arrangments range from baffling to ludicrous. But when she clicks, as on ""Gonna Get Close To You"" and ""Wait For An Answer"", which was later covered by Heart, you can hear her potential, at least as a songwriter. Still, ""Whomanfoursays"" is a very difficult album to listen to for very long."
2,A Warning about this CD,"Beware this CD...IF, like me, you were expecting hard rock.I have been curious about Dalbello for years, ever since hearing Queensryche's cover of ""Gonna get close to you"" and her work on Alex Lifeson's solo CD in 1995. The only time I ever actually saw one of her CDs (this one), it was a $30 import and that was just too pricey for something I had never heard.Well, I'm here to tell you that, after coming across a used copy for $5, I'm sure glad I didn't shell out that $30!!! I am very disappointed, this stuff is New-Wave pop that reminds me more of Bananarama or the Go Go's than her work with Alex or the way Queensryche covered ""Gonna get close"".While I can appreciate her talents and singing abilities, this type of music isn't my cup-of-tea at all. So don't make the mistake I did, especially if you're asked to shell out more than $10. Be sure you know what you're gonna get because it sure isn't anything resembling Queensryche or ""Start Today""."
1,Presario 2800T = total bust,"I bought a new Presario 2800T to run Suse 8.0 Pro and its a total dog. I've done several installs and it still can't run my laptop worth a damn. It constantly hangs. It can't even determine if my computer is SMP or single processor. I've had to reinstall Xfree86, take PCMCIA out of the kernel, reconfigure alsa on a regular basis. Hey, Suse did you even test this in a Compaq? I can't believe your making money with this. I'm going to have to dump Suse and try Redhat."
3,Great for PC's - Not so for server...,"I am a recent convert to Linux. Having used SuSE 8.1 Pro on a PC and Laptop. I love the look and feel, the ease of installation, and the administration (YaST2) tools. I've installed it on my laptop and PC. And it is great. Like the ability to select what packages are installed. Like all the available utilities, tools and accesories. Gives my old PC new life. Thought I needed a new PC. Turned out, I just needed a new OS.However, I am extremely disappointed that SuSE does not support RAID. Am unable to install it successfully on a small server with RAID. The installation allows me to select and install the AACRAID drivers into the kernel. But, the boot hangs. When I contacted SuSE, they informed me they don't support RAID.Again, great product for the PC/Laptop. If you want Linux on a server using RAID, try another distrobution."
1,A buggy *.0 release - wait for 8.1,"I ""upgraded"" from SuSE 7.2 to 8.0 only to encounter a lot ofbugs. Things that worked nicely in 7.2 no longer worked. Here isa brief list of problems I encountered:configures system to run at level 4! after upgradefails to detect hardware that was previously (7.2) handled correctly (ethernet card, TV-tuner, sound system)Misconfigures X11 to claim low resolution graphics options whilerunning in high res-mode (which is unavailable from its configuration tool, Yast2)Apache web server has scripts with typosKDE menus very disorganized, redundant and inconsistentKDE customization broken as delivered (you need to online update first unless you like to redo your customization evry time)Prarallel printer driver broken (their ""free installation support"" considers a non-functional printer to be part of asuccessful installation: you are on your own)"
4,SuSE Linux 8.0,"This is a great distribution. The new version of KDE is the best desktop I have worked with, and the assortment of programs included will meet every need. If you have a complicated system, however, be careful with installation. I had a second hard drive with a HPFS partition and four small FAT partitions. The installation program did not touch the HPFS partition, but it erased all the data on the FAT partitions leaving them blank."
1,Horrible,"While suse boast about the new product, itis far from perfect. It does not recognize USB2 CDRWs. It recognized it when the usb zip was not installed. Also the USB printer is unstable. WHen I called the number for support. I got nothing. Also the I emailed them and got nothing. I guess they have joined Microsoft in putting out bad product and not caring. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I was a loyal user of SUse but not anymore. Will try RedHat because SUSe [stinks]!!!"
5,Amazing!,"I bought these boots for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves them. They are very warm, very dry, and perfect for any outdoor work or activity. They're also much easier to get on than they look in the picture."
5,excellent boots,I received the boots and I think they are perfect. TheY are more confortable than tennis or sneakers. I have used them all day and I am not tired after use them. PERFECT BOOTS WITH ANKLE PROTECTION. GOOD AND STRONG DESIGN . I HAVE ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK WITH THEM AND I AM SO HAPPY
5,Winter boots and then some!,"These are the best all weather boots I've purchased. Snow, rain, mud...you name it. They are tuff and then some. I only regret not wearing them every day."
5,AWESOME BOOTS!!,"These boots (Sorel Conquest) are awesome! Yes, if you stand around for a hours, not moving your feet, they will get a little cold. But so far I have worn them to -38 degree weather for about 5 hours while I was hunting here in Alaska. My feet were on fire and sweaty by the time I get them off. And that's wearing boot socks, not thick winter socks. After 17 years in the military I thought I wouldn't EVER wear anything but Danner's on my feet, but I have to hand it to Sorel with these boots. So far they are awesome. I tell everyone that ask about them, if they like there feet to be warm and toasty when it's cold outside they should buy them. And trust me, here around Fairbanks we know what cold is! (-40 to -60)"
3,Sorel Winter Boot,"The looks and comfort of this boot have not disappointed and I suspect they will give me good service - However the manufacturers state the boot will keep your feet warm to -40deg. I have so far worn them in temperatures around +3deg and my feet were not particularly warm when standing in one place for any length of time. I fear that in temperatures much below this my feet will feel decidedly cold in these boots. I live in the UK where winters are not particularly harsh and hoped if I bought a boot I thought was designed for much harsher climates I could not go wrong, I have my doubts. I use my boots mostly to go fishing in so am stationary for long periods. If you are on the move quite a lot then that may make a considerable difference.So in summary:-Strong rugged *****Waterproof *****Comfort walking *****Comfort warmth (The main reason I bought the boot) **"
3,"Not true to size, Color was way off","These boots came in today and gave them a try. I feel the boots run large, not true to size at all. I own other boots(timberland, Vasque) that are mens size 12 US and fits perfect. These boots felt like a 14 US.The color was also not even close to what is pictured. My ""boulder"" color boots were a dark grey, the same exact color as the rubber on the side of the boot. The outside of the box has a sticker saying the color is boulder/brown, clearly wrong.Back to Amazon they go."
4,Almost to good!,"I live and work in north Japan were we have had over 15 feet of snow this winter. The temps average about 20 degrees during the day and about 10 degrees at night. I work outside 50% of the time, and the other 50% inside. I was issued boots when I got here and they were the worst boots I had ever had. I ordered the Sorel Conquest Boots and was very happy with the design and craftsmanship. The boots keep me dry and warm, almost too warm. The boots will make your feet perspire therefor your feet get wet and that leads to another issue. Overall I was pleased with the purchase."
4,great boots,"these are the best boots i brought out 6 pair that i purchase,the boots are good but after 2 hour my feet got a little cold by not freezing they work good."
2,Beautiful boot. Poor internal design.,"As at least one other reviewer noted, there is a design problem with the tongue of the boot. The tongue, together with the metal latches create a hard lump in the tongue of the boot that quite literally digs into your shin. This happened with both boots. This could also be due to the unnecessary calf strap and/or the gator at the top of the boot. In the end, after giving these boots a try in sub-zero weather in Anchorage, Alaska this year, I returned them. Beautiful boots, painful internal design."
1,beware of sloppy construction,"I didn't buy these, but tried them on at Fred Meyer. I pulled the laces tight to snug up the boot, and one of the steel eyelet rings popped right out of the leather. Apparently the rivet wasn't secured correctly from behind. I tried the other boot and the same thing happened! These are not cheap boots, so they should be better made than this. All these boots are made by underpaid, overworked people in China, so what do you expect, right? I ended up buying another pair of Chinese-made boots for $40 on sale. Al least I won't feel so bad when they don't hold up for more than a year!"
2,upper rub ankles,"While these boots are great winter boots, and seem to be more supportive than regular pack boots, the jury is still out. I have them for about three weeks and they tend to rub on the ankles near the exterior strap. Perhaps a break in period will make them more comfortable but it seems to be longer than normal and they are still rubbing my ankles raw near that exterior strap and leather area which the strap is attached with. Had I known this problem I would have purchased something different....if they don't break in I'll return them go with something from North Face."
3,bigger than it looks,"This boot is warm and has decent build quality. It is bigger than it looks, though. I bought it partly because I was hoping for a warm boot that wasn't as loose and ""galumphy"" as a traditional pac boot. I was looking for something that fit more securely and was a bit lighter - more a warm hiking boot. This boot has full laces but you can't realy make it snug like a hiking boot. It is closer to a pac boot than a hiking boot.The gaiter ""keeper"" bites your shin if you don't have enough pant/padding stuffed into the boot.They are warm and comfortable, and over all a decent boot - but they don't have removable liners and quite the same ease of off/on as a pac boot, and they don't fit as securely or comfortably as a hiking boot. They are clearly a compromise."
5,Serious boots for serious winter conditions,"Very happy with these boots. Super warm, snow collar helps keep feet dry when plowing through stuff well up on the knee. Strap adds some decent ankle support when scuffing around on uneven/slippery surfaces. Were comfortable right out of the box and so far have had absolutely no leakage. About the only minor complaint I could make is that they are a little tedious to lace up as the laces bind at each eyelit - have to tighten up one set of eyelits at a time."
5,Great boots!,"Very comfortable, can wear them all day right out of the box. Lightweight yet keep my feet warm in 36 degree temps."
2,Buyer Beware!,"I am willing to admit that I contributed to my disappointment by purchasing a used book instead of brand new. However, those of us familiar with the costs of legal texts I am certain will understand my motivation. The edition I received from bookseller ""oilpainter13"" was a 20 year old text!! 8th Edition, NOT 9th Edition as advertised by Amazon. While the references and principles cited are obviously sound (after all, they're citing law) THEY ARE CONSPICUOUSLY DATED. My two stars are for the text itself in spite of its age. Apparently Oilpainter13 takes comfort in the fact that Amazon does not have any reviewer rate the provider."
1,fo' real?,Is anyone else creeped out by the all-too adult themed cover for this talented young star-----(sigh) another young star that is being exploited in the wrong way. Who is her manager.....oh yeah...that's right..
4,I wanted more ballads...but it is WORTH my PURCHASE,"Hi there. When I bought the Cd, I was expecting more ballads. As you know, Jennifer Does really good on those type of songs. I am not really into the MEXICAN REGIONAL TYPE SONGS. I like LATIN POP MOSTLY. So I was a little dissapointed that it has less than half of the BALLADS, but EVERY SONG has great LYRICS. THE LYRICS save everthing else. I strongly urge you to BUY THIS CD. Perhaps after all, you will want to dance to the beat of the other songs. Just in case you did not know, Jennifer's current SMASH HIT SINGLE: Vivo y muero en tu piel"" Is NUMBER 1 on the BILLBOARD TRACKS. And her Album debuted at Number 1 too. So there you have it. A great CD to enjoy."
4,One of Jennifers better recordings if not her Best!,"This album has beautiful heartfelt ballads such as ""Vivo y muero en tu piel"",""Hasta el fin del mundo"" and ""Para Olvidarte de Mi"",also some uptempo numbers such as""Aunque me Cuesta la Vida"".This is definetly a recording worth owning and listening to.Look out there is a version of this release which includes a Dvd with the music video to ""Vivo y Muero en tu Piel"" and some extra material.I would be happy if Jennifer records more material like this in the future.She seems to really shine when it comes to warm heartfelt ballads.This is a must buy!"
3,A Jeam,"Jen take us inside a world we don't want to leave and I love every song on here. Her voice is so nice and she does remine me of Jessica Andrews who is another singer. Jen brings life, love, and joy to her music and I am glad I pick up this cd."
3,Average music,"It has been three albums now that she's been solo, and she still has not come close to being as good as she was when she was fronting Y Los Jetz. And her new pornstar image is just beyond bizarre. She needs to leave that look to the Pilars and the Gisselles."
3,Very Informative,"""Why Do Cats Do That"" is an informative book. It tells why cats do the things they do! For instance, why their eyes glow, why they purr, why the flop down on their sides when they are happy...and so on. However, this book is a bit on the dull side, and not one to really get into."
2,Stooges - 'Live 1971 & Early Live Rarities' (Starfighter),"As much as I've always loved Iggy & The Stooges - I have to honestly give this CD a two-star rating. As far as what I could tell, this poor quality live Stooges CD was the only title that the French label Starfighter had ever put out. 'Live 1971 & Early Live Rarities' is dubbed as an unofficial release, just the same. First six songs here - ""I Got A Right"", ""You Don't Call My Name"", ""See Me Dancing"", ""That's What I Like"" + two more are from a very poor quality fan (obviously) recorded tape. Gig took place at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis sometime in May, 1971. However, all is not lost. The last four songs on this [for completists only] piece are actually okay - at least for demos and rarities. I sort of liked ""TV Eye"" and the aptly-titled ""Ron's Jam"". On the back cover, this CD notes ""Due to unavailability of certain master recordings, surface noise may be evident on certain tracks"". Yeah! You think?"
2,how many pages left?,"Lots of original ideas, pretty iffy execution.Some emphasize the feminist credentials of the book, but why? Just because there are no men left on Earth/Mars? If so, the gender aspect just doesn't seem very pronounced or relevant. Could have been all male characters and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. I certainly expected a more radically different worldview there.But mostly, after a while I didn't really care about what happened to the protagonists. I just couldn't buy into anybody's point of view or stay interested in the plot. Or, for that matter, really understand what the plot was about.Your mileage may very well vary however. There is so much cookie cutter sci-fi out there that the writer deserves praise for breaking out of the usual subject matters."
3,Not for everyone,"A very strange story that will not appeal to just anyone. There's a sense of detachment from the characters because they are so far removed from humanity. It is far future and humans have augmented themselves in various ways that make them seem less human, such as the kappa (taken from Japanese myth). In most of known space there is only one gender: female. Children are grown like plants and, I assume, raised by communities. So there is no mother/father/family dynamic. Everything seems detached to me; I had a hard time caring for the characters.I did like the structure of the book, though. How it switches back and forth in short chapters from the hunter to the hunted. And it is nicely written. Liz Williams is definitely a writer to watch!"
3,Pretty good choice,"This book is a pretty good choice if you need a refresher. As stated above, the illustrations could have been better, but they're not bad. The main thing that bugged me was the fact that there is no glossary. Yes, the book has definitions written into it, but it has no glossary. Sometimes you may want a more thorough definition. It's not that big of a deal, it's only inconvienent. You will be able to cover multiple chapters in a day and have an understanding of all of it. The writing style used makes learning easy, very easy. I only rented it from the library and I was able to finish it before it was due. Hope this helps."
3,Its too casual.,"It says that it can be used as a real textbook, but its too casual. After reading it, I didn't know the REAL names of anything. and that's very important when trying to answer an essay question. It broke everything down easily and I was able to understand. That was good. So, i'd recommend this book if you just need help understanding some things about biology (NOT ALL). Its good for that."
3,"5+ star bits, but the case is feral","I've had this set for several years now, picked up on a trip to America, and I've found it so useful for both my American products I brought over, and the Australian products I've purchased here. It's also great for around the house DIY stuff. The only drawback is the absolutely feral case, that has broken two small drill bits trying to pry them out, and makes it really miserable if you need different sizes for a single job. The frustrating case makes this a 3 star, but the set itself is just fine. You do get duplicates, but given that screwdriver bits this inexpensive will wear over time, or get lost in the midst of a job, you'll be thankful you have them."
1,VERY CHEAP!,"Was made very cheap, most of the drill bits broke off with a little pressure, would not recommend this product."
3,nice set - bad case,The set is a really nice little kit - I paid $10 on Amazon through a web deal. The item would be better if the drille bits were not so hard to remove from the case. I was afraid of snapping the smaller bits in half. Again nice set but poor case.
3,"""OK""",Lots of bits most are repeated so if you want 20 Philips screwdrivers this is up your alley.The driver for the package is cheap and falls apart under any torque. Attempted to use it to simply finish a screw off for a TV mount and it broke and couldnt provide enough torque to finish it off. Used a socket wrench without issue after.All in all its a good size set for the price.
2,Bad bits,"It's not a horrible deal for the money, but if you're looking for a set of reliable bits don't get this one. Most of the smaller HSS bits snapped within 10 uses and the screwdriver bits had similar problems. The screwdriver itself is not well made and the mechanism falls apart/fails on a regular basis."
3,"work great, but rusty...","work great, but about a couple of months... some rust appear... i keep my tools in boxes... but rust is in the all pieces."
4,Like it so far,It seems to be decently well made for the price. Have not used it yet but will have to see how durable the parts are after sometime.
3,ok for the price,This is an okay buy for the price. I should emphasize you get what you pay for. The quality is not terrible B&D could do much better. But for the price you can't do too much worse.
4,You Get What You Pay For..,Nothing much to say about this other than it's great for the price. The screwdriver is a bit flimsy but that's expected with a $15 tool set. Overall it's a decent buy for quick fixer uppers and what not.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought my first house about 3 years ago and one of the first tools I bought was a cordless drill. When I went to buy bits and drivers for it, I thought I'd save a few dollars and get this B&D set. The second time I used one of the drivers, the bit holder (which is what attaches to the drill) sheared of while driving a screw. Now all the driver bits are worthless. The drill bits themselves have held up OK. I've broken two of the smaller ones, and the others have held their sharpness for the most part. As a replacement for this B&D set, I went out and purchased one of the Craftsman Speed-Lok sets and I couldn't be happier with it."
2,Don't get misled 50% of items are the same,"It says 109 pc, but what will you do with 109 pieces of same size bit.Don't get misled 50% of items are the same thing, so think it 55pc set."
1,Poor quality,"For the price I guess I shouldn't complain. You do get a lot of little pieces. Unfortunately they won't last long. The screw driver handle on my set started to come loose after one use. Not worth the effort to return. Probably ok if just used lightly around the house, but not in the shop."
1,Really poor quality,"I've had this kit for some months and never used it much until this past weekend.It seems the driver bits are made out of something like pot metal. In the course of hanging some bicycle hooks in the garage, I stripped seven -- yes, seven -- of the Phillips head bits. This was under minimum torque on an electric driver. The bits each stripped and became unusable. I examined the screws carefully, not a sign of rounding or egging on the screw heads -- the driver bits are made of junk.The same thing happened tonight -- turning a simple T10 hex screw on a clock case, and the bit stripped. Again, no damage to the screw.FYI, I'm not a novice with tools and this was not user error. I'm very precise with fasteners, having spent better than a decade wrenching on motorcycles for a living.This kit is low grade and I am tossing it as soon as I can find a better replacement."
4,Great for small jobs,"The Black & Decker 71-968 109pc Accessory set comes with almost everything you will need for small jobs, plus it has it's own carring case. I keep the set in my kitchen, it saves me from running up and down to my work bench in the cellar, when I need a screw driver or drill bit."
5,The album that got me into them,"One of those few bands that took heads and showed no remorse in there carnage parade! Awsome songs: this love, walk, hostile. If you dont own this, something is wrong with you. Side note darrel once said he had his guitar bridge routed out so he could whammy it at a greater degree, whcihc produces some of his dive bomb sounds."
5,Vulgar Display of Metal,"Well, many pantera fans describe as 'Far Beyond Driven' as the best and i should say that different fans have different opinions. 'Far Beyond Driven' is the heaviest but it doesn't have the Power of VDOP. In my opinion, 'Vulgar' and 'Cowboys From Hell' are my favorites even though they both sound very different. Darrell will remain as probably the best guitarist of all time. And Kirk Hammett too. But overall, this album truly ... from beginning to end. Pantera will remain victorious over all those nu-metals that try to sound heavy and look evil even though THEY ARE NOT. For new pantera fans, this would be a great start. Their latest album is also great."
5,True Classic,"anybody who knows anything about metal, or even music in general knows pantera's impact on every corner of the metal scene. it's possible that this album is just TOO metal for anyone giving it a bad review, but for everyone else this is the DEFINITION of metal. so you people who want to hate on pantera and this album right now can wait for VH1 to run a special that says how amazing this album is and the impact it has had and then maybe you'll give it a second listen and realize what you've been missing out on all along."
5,1 of the heaviest albums ever,"I think Pantera is one of the heaviest bands out there next to Metallica,Ozzy and Helmet. VDOP kicks butt with songs like walk,a new level,f*****g hostile,conceit,live in a hole & demons.this is one of their best albums next to CFH."
5,Sweet Album Cover,"what can i say but wow, the guys in Pantera shelled out one of the sweetest CD's ever, if you go on a trip and can only take on CD take this one it is good, really good. It doesn't deserve a parental advisory though, that was the only thing messed up about it. Dime Bag kicks his 6 string into high gear and goes all out not holding anything back. Phil's vocals are unbelvable too, it is SWEET."
5,The greatest album from one of Metal's best Bands!,"Usually I am ashamed to admit I once listened to metal, now prefering Punk and Hardcore, but this album consistantly gets played on my stereo, hard hitting with lyrics which maintain a level of intellegence far above the drivel usually found on metal albums, one of my guilty pleasures."
5,Vulgar..Power!,this is the kind of music that got me thru high school. most of the songs make me 4get fear and stand up 2 tha 1's that tried to intimidate me..
5,It makes me want to break stuff,"This a great album from beginning to end for metal fans. Just be carful because you may be inclined to body check innocent bystanders or use your own body to break tables, etc. Just saying....it's powerful stuff!"
4,Pantera at their best,"This is an old cd but is still one of the best cd's i own. This is probably their best album to date & is a must for anyone who likes Pantera. Anouther album worth getting is ""reinventing the steel"" which is their latest album & is almost as good as this one."
5,Back Breaking,"I notice there are a lot of reviews defending Pantera or the opposite, ripping them to shreds. At the end of the day who cares what anyone else thinks?I listen to most types of music and wouldn't consider myself a 'metal-head'. However, there are times when all I want to hear is some heart-pounding drum beats combined with finger-shredding guitar licks. In this case, I turn to Pantera and VDOP.Nothing really compares to this CD at full volume in the car, stunning my speakers and onlookers alike. I love metallica, but even they seem like Hanson compared to the sheer brutality of Pantera's music. I find it good motivation for that monday morning at work, or before a big football game. By demons be driven, this love, f**king hostile, regular people all get my blood flowing and fired up.If you like b*lls to the wall, flat out, relentlessly hard and agressive music, buy this CD, you won't regret it.If you don't like this music, don't listen to it."
5,pantera haters please.......GROW UP,"I have just barley got done listening to this album and Im very impressed. If you love Pantera buy this album.Oh by the way for all you on this page who say things agianst Pantera. Nobody wants to hear what you have to say. If you don't like pantera then don't listen to them. I didn't like pantera long a go but when I didn't I never went on about them like you people do. I have respect for good musicians. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM SO CAN IT. eVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE dIMEBAG THEN LEAVE HIM ALONE, THE MAN IS DEAD CAN'T YOU SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT! I'm sure if you would of met him before he died you would of relized not trash a respectable musician. You know what kind of people argue about this stuff like you do? Children and ignorant people."
5,Pantera- Vulgar Display Of Power,"Pantera is one of the best death-metal that has ever hit the metal scene. After listening to the cries and screams of Korn's singer John Davis, who sings for this band screams 100x better. The guitars and drums intermix to create pure metal poetry. Also recommended Metallica- S&M."
1,Vulgar Display of Ineptitude,"In all my years of listening to metal, I never got why Pantera was so revered. What puzzles me even more is that the same people who hold this band on such a high pedastal are so quick to bash nu metal bands like Slipknot and Mudvayne when, in reality, they are pretty much the same thing.Repetitive down-tuned chord progressions passed off as heavy riffing? Check.An annoying vocalist trying to sound like a tough guy, but ending up sounding like a fourth grade school bully? Check.Meat-headed ""you don't understand me""/""I'm tougher than you"" lyrics? Check.Formulaic song structure? Double check.Face it, people. This band was never anything more than a high-school headbanger MTV band, and a dead guitarist won't change that. All their talk of killing trends and being the defenders of heavy metal was nothing more than a smoke and mirrors act to cover up the truth that they were just as manufactured, if not more, than any ""alternative"" band of the time."
5,The most mind-blowing heavy metal album ever released!!!!!!,"I have owned this cd for 2 years now and in my humble opinion it is THE MOST KICK butt ALBUM EVER MADE!!!!! If you were to just listen to the first 5 songs, that would be okay because those are the best anyways. With hits like ""Mouth For War"", ""This Love"", and in my opinion, the heaviest song ever made, ""Walk"", who can live without this cd. If you are a true metal fan, you will buy this cd. All I have left to say is BUY THIS DAMN CD!!!!!!!!"
3,Lets be honest with ourselves,"For years I have been reading reviews that point to this album as one of the greatest ever. I finally decided to go buy it. I gave it a number of listens and have come to a final conclusion: What in the hell is everyone talking about?! It's just a typical metal album, nothing really that original, nothing that exiting. I mean it's still a good listen, don't get me wrong, but it sure in the hell doesn't rank on my list as the greatest."
2,Vulgar Display of Posing,"If you want brutal and honest musik, just listen to Razor's ""Shotgun Justice"" album, it makes this mallcore album sound like what it is....you figure it out.."
2,Vulgar Display of Music,"The ex- kings of glam who trie to be a metal band only get worst with this one. I think if they replaced Phil Anselmo on vocals, they would have more chance to be a real heavy band. anyway, there are some good songs on this one. And the cover artwork, well, forget about it.."
1,Dull-all they do is scream!,"My head hurts and my ears are bleeding. All Pantera's frontman does is scream! He's also a little too high on the explicit lyrics level. If you want great metal, look elsewhere. Vulgar Display Of Power is not a good choice. However, Dimebag Darrell is a very good guitarist, so one star for him."
1,BACKSTREET METAL FOR LIFE IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE!,YES WE HAVE A MATCH FOR THE BACKSTREET BOYS NOW.BOTH BANDS DOUND EXACTLY ALIKE.EVERYONE PROBABLY AGREES WITH ME TOO.BUY THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH ALL THE REST AND ADD IT TO YOUR'E BACKSTREET BOYS COLLECTION.
1,Uhhh...Oh Yeah! It Sucked!,"After buying Vulgar Display Of Power a couple of months ago I was shocked and annoyed buy what I heard. I can't believe all the hype Pantera has. Being a HUUUGE Metallica fan, a few of my friends at school recommended Pantera to me. I heard of them tonsa times before. Of course, the whole school hated Metallica and loved Pantera. Finally I bought Pantera's Vulger Display Of Power thinking it'd be a sure shot. The only sure thing about it is that it sucked. Phil Anselmo's annoying voice of screams, grunts, and curses ruin the whole album. Being an aspiring guitarist, I am offended by Dimebag's lack of talent and creativity. All his riffs sound like ripoffs of other metal bands. And the drumming is just terrible! Vinnie Paul must be the worst drummer around. Rex probably plays the worst basslines I've heard. Pantera has sooo much hype and popularity, but no talant at all. There are hundreds of better metal bands out there."
2,"""By Demons Be Driven"" track on this is NOT the origional cd version!!!!","Track 10 ""By Demons Be Driven"" on this downloadable is NOT the origional cd version. Its some sort of remix. I bought this and am a little upset about it... Buyer beware"
5,A Speed Metal classic,"VDoP is, without a doubt, Pantera's best work--a Speed Metal classic. This it the Pantera that people will be listening to 20 years from now."
5,STEP UP AND FEEL THE PAIN,"When I first bought this album six years ago, I didn't know what to make of it. It didn't take long before I realized this was the future of heavy metal music. If you want to hear a brutal, uncompromising slab of sheer rage, pick this up."
5,VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER,PANTERA WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN AND MADEE A GREAT CD REMEMBER THIS WAS RECORDED DURING THE ALTERNATIVE MUSIC ERA LIKE NIRANA SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU CAN LICK MY HAIRY NUT SACK
4,"Strong, but not Perfect","Pantera's second non-hair metal album, and not aaa bad one. Phil's vox on this album have become a might too monochromatic and aggro, when compared to Cowboys from Hell, though. The songwriting is similarly more catered to the aggro crowd than on Cowboys. Don't get me wrong, Pantera's thrash sesibilities are stronger than the nineties mallcore leanings by far, but the riffs are just a might too simple and chunky. Dimebag's leads are quite impressive, the man had a gift for pinch harmonics. Overall, a good but not great release."
4,I can't breath,"What a kick in the face! Few bands have ever managed to be as brutal and uncomprimising as Pantera. The definative thrash metal album of the 90s. When Metallica sold out, Slayer left their best material behind, and Joey Belladonna left Anthrax, these guys came along and saved metal from what seemed to be the end. While not the most consistent album ever made, tracks such as ""The Walk"" and ""Mouth For War"" show why this is regarded as a classic in the genre of thrash metal. ""Cowboys From Hell"" was an okay album, but this easilly beats it."
5,PANTERA WAS GREATNESS,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF METAL OR PANTERA!!! IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS YOU SUCK!!!! Ha ha ha
3,GOOD BUT NOT THAT GOOD,"This is not a good cd,it's actually pretty good songs like ThisLove,New Level,By Demons Be Driven,Mouth For War just about everytune is good except the repetitive Walk.And this cd can get oldreally fast and at times can seem kind of weak.But it's overallgood but not a huge step up from their debut Cowboy's From Hell(also pretty good).They stepped it up a notch on the later cd'slike Far Beyond Driven and Reinventing The Steel because thosecds are loud,fast,raw,and brutal everything Pantera should be.This cd would be alot better for people who are into the nu-metalscene with bands like Korn,Disturbed,Godsmack,e.t.c because thisalbum is not really loud and raw.But it's still good If you'reinto heavier stuff like old Metallica,Slayer,Slipknot,Chimaira,Killswitch Engage then stick with the later Pantera cds.Dimebagget's some killer solo's on here though...."
2,Only two good songs.,"This album fron Pantera is very overrated. There are only two good songs on this album. They are Mouth for war and Walk. The rets is just Sh*t. If you want to get a better Pantera album, get Cowboyes from hell. It's a better thrash metal album.Hey L baker chip, why the hell did you copy my previous review? Your an idiot!!"
1,Hi!,"I got a Lady Gaga CD the other week and ever since then I've really been getting into music. I'm really digging this CD by the brutal death metal band Panther. The groovy rhythems make me want 2 dance, and the guitarist is really talented I hope I can meet him at their next concert!!I'm a little put off by the fact all the songs are either about hitting a guy or wanting to hit a guy, but we all have our days, LOL. :D XD"
1,sucky albulm,"Ok the only decent song on this albulm is Walk and it isn't very good I wish I could rate this albulm -100 but I can't so I have to rate It one I would not recomend this to any body who like real metal and not a bunch of stupid sounds and a very suck singer try Slayer,Metallica,Megadeth,Anthrax,Slipknot,Machine Head,and Black Sabboth if you like real metal or try some other good metal but avoid Pantera and A lot of Mastdons stuff sucks to except for about6 songs."
1,youve gotta be kidding,Do not buy this album its the worst album ever made. dont get me wrong i love loud intense heavy metal but this is just noize. the singer screeches and you can hear his throat almost about to explode every second he whails out his peverted lyrics. the rest of the band just pound on there instruments. i honestly love loud angry metal. but metal is supposed to be energenic. passionite and have some musical value to it. pantera dosent have any of these qaulities. they think that if they can sound angry theyre all set. does it really take any talent to screech like an insane serilal killer? all pantera are is a bunch of cocks---ng loudmouth mother fu--rs who scream furiously and have no idea how to play theyre instruments. if you want real metal check out 80s metalica. slayer. system of a down. Rage against the machine preferably there self titled album. f-ck PANTERA.
5,RIP Dimebag. We'll miss you.,"I really cannot believe this. I was already feeling down on this day, being the anniversary of John Lennon's death, and this really put me over the edge. The fact that people can do this kind of thing really makes me sick. Dimebag, we'll never forget you for the great music and great times you've given us. Rest in peace, man."
4,Great Disc,"Pantera's thrashing metal riffs and screaming vocals are absolutely amazing. When I listen to their songs I hear obvious Metallica, and Black Sabbath influence. If you are even remotely into metal I would buy this album. It just cranks!!!There are a lot of people that don't give metal the credit it needs, and deserves. I am not bashing the pop scene at all, because if something is good I will give it props. I just don't agree with the overplaying of songs on radio, MTV, and such. I just think more people need to expand their horizons and listen different kinds of music rather than listening to whatever is on the radio. I mean, if you are having a bad day and are mad at the world, you don't wanna pop in ""I want it that Way"", you wanna hear some rippin metal! So all you pop princesses, and little boys out there, buy this album and you won't be dissapointed!"
5,Varg Vikernes is a dolt,"Vinnie did not die, you goof, it was Dimebag. Get your fact straight before you post or it will make you look like a moron. Wait, it already did.Next to CFH, VDOP is my fav. metal album. Walk is a courage builder that makes you say ""I don't give a F***!"" Hallow is the best on this album."
4,"""Everyday Life.""","The song ""Walk"" expresses to me that every once in awhile, people get on your nerves, and you just want to tell them to step off! I feel strongly that this song says exactly that. The whole Vulgar Display Of Power album is hard, heavy, and relates to everyday life. It's not about religion, it's about the terrible things that people do in life, sometimes to other people, and to themselves. I give it a high rating of 4 because Pantera shows the emotions in their songs that others may think are too risky to elaborate on."
5,One of the best metal albums ever,"This is one of the best metal albums ever. Pantera paved the way for hundreds of other bands to follow. Anselmo's vocals, Dimebag's chainsaw guitar and Vinnie's drums created a number of most memorable metal songs. We are all going to miss you Dimebag...rest in peace"
1,terrible peice of sh--t,THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. i hate pantera they are the worst band in exsistince. the singer here screeches like an insane babboon and has no more singing talent than a phycopathic racoon with a sour throat. dimebag darell is ridicoulusly overated. hes only an average ordinary guitarist only he has the worst most annoying guitar riffs when hes not soloing. thers no particular drum talent. but the singing and guitar playing and lack of muscianship is awful. this is the worst album ive ever heard in my life. skip this and go buy metalicas master of puppets.
4,A great if little known musician.,Living in the shadow of Clapton and Mark Knopfler seems to have been the unjust fate of this amazing guitar player-songwriter when he can easily equal them in any of those arias.This is the best introduction to his exceptional and diverse work;the first thing that should be immediately obvious to the new listener is the great class and fine taste of this musician-Chris Rea is indeed a poet of great elegance and refinement.
4,pleasant memories,"when this first was released, I'd heard 'working on it' on the radio. I couldn't get the driving music out of my head. why I waited so long to purchase the music, only makes having it that much sweeter.good stuff."
2,"Page Turner? Yes, but only because ---","you want to find some hope.Not being a fan of first person fiction, I began reading this book with apprehension. However, the storyline according to the jacket cover was compelling, as I enjoy a good murder mystery.This book was not a joy to read. Not only was it depressing as one reviewer noted, it is oppressing to the point of the reader cloying for air.Although the characters were well thought out, they were cold and unapproachable.Give yourself time to read this book because you cannot sit and read large sections at a time."
2,A not quite completed and miserable book.,"I have to say that I'm giving the book two stars because I was actually able to finish reading the book. It was SO depressing. There was not even a glimmer of light in this book. The ONLY ""character"" I found the smallest bit compelling was Max the dog, and even he was killed!Also, the book left open way too many ends. It was as if the author got tired of writing his own book and just wanted to finish it up as quickly as possible. And who could blame him, it was pathetic.I belong to a book club and this was one of our selections, one of the members said ""it was like a bad car wreck, nothing good about it but you had to look"". I guess she was right."
2,Disappointed,"I usually agree with the Amazon reviewers, but not this time, so maybe it's just me. Lawrence was not a sympathetic character like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder or John Connelly's Charlie Parker. In fact, I can't think of one character in the book that I didn't think was a total loser, including the dog. Lawrence lies on a police report because he's convinced by the mayor and chief of police that it's the best thing for the town; of course, it doesn't hurt that he's being promised a promotion. From then on, he whines about his situation and is constantly asking for help or borrowing money from his semi-girlfriend who is annoying as he is. And then he wonders why his ex-wife won't let him see their little boy anymore."
4,In defence of book and author,"I feel I have to defend this book and its author after reading reviews by Bobby 77 and r.smith. I dont know what kind of books they normally read, but if they thought this book was ""pathetic"" and ""depressing"", then they should read romantic fiction instead. This book is obviously too intelligent and well written for them."
1,sh*te,"One of the worst books I have ever read. It is not literature, and it is not crime fiction. All of the characters are hokey and unsympathetic. The plot is thin and overly convoluted. The ending is hackneyed and lacking in credibility. Finally, I really wish that if Irish writers write stories set in the USA, they would first learn how Americans talk, to give the dialogue a little bit of authenticity. I have never heard an American say ""I've""."
2,"Despair, Depression, Complete Passivity","I could not figure out how the writer spent 6-12 months of his life with a character who thought so little and did nothing. Lawrence's alcoholism didn't bother me, this bothered me: someone kills his dog and tries to kill him: he doesn't try to find out who did it, he tells no one, he barely thinks about it.And that's just the extreme example of his characteristic response to pretty much everything. It is as if Collins set himself the task to write a battered woman as a male cop and make the battered cop the hero of a ""crime novel"". And justify it with the ""noir"" tag. But I should qualify that: plenty of battered women show more spunk and initiative that our hero. All it is is a relatively un-insightful account on a man sliding into depression."
3,Average Entertainment,"LOST SOULS was a book that was recommended to me on a message board. The book was average entertainment to me. The storyline was ok. The protagonist has a pretty crappy life yet he finds a way to get us to the end. I actually felt bad for him which is a good thing when you are drawn into a character's life. I always try to figure out the ending before I am finished and I didn't have this one pegged...another good thing about the book. So while it kept me interested in some ways, in other ways it just wasn't a real page turner. Good title for the content of the book."
2,All Music & No Rachel Dancing,"I wouldn't have bought this if I'd realized it was a CD instead of a DVD. The music is as it should be, but I was disappointed because I have Bellydance Superstars 3 and thought this would also feature dancing & not just music. I guess the fact that this was a CD would've been evident if I'd looked hard enough, but beware--read the fine print!"
3,Tweaked,"I was somewhat disappointed that a heavy bass beat - not beledy - has been added to many of the songs, so the rock-n-roll/hip hop aspect was a bit much."
2,The worst of the Bellydance Superstar series,"Most songs have a club beat to it and that is fine, if you are looking for music with a Middle Eastern flair to listen to.For bellydancers, this CD will most likely be a disappointment. I am not opposed to more modern music for bellydancing, but I don't like this artificial club beat overlay on these songs. Besides, if you already own some bellydance music, chances are you already own the same or better versions of Bel Arabi, Enta Omri, Bitwannes Beek, Ala Meen and Zeina.The ones I do like on this CD, and find usable are Turbo Tabla 4 and Isham Houshan's drum solo.I use the Bellydance Superstar CDs 1, 2, 3 and 5 for my class, but this CD stays on the shelf."
3,More techno cr@p,"I liked tracks 6 & 12. The original long version of Batawanees Beek makes the hair on my arms stand up! This one leaves me cold. I think most of this techno stuff is just too busy for me. Frantic, repetitive, and feels like an aerobic class. You can't interpret the rhythm/melody with that d!mn#d overpowering beat! What happened to the emotion? Isn't that the whole point behind art?"
4,Another good one,This cd is good. But I love all the BSS cd's. The first and fifth one are the best in my opinion. But good to have if you are a performer.
4,Great songs for belly dance warm-ups and routines!,"This CD is packed with songs, mostly quick-paced and energetic, that will get you in the mood to put on your hip scarf and dance! My absolute favorite is track number seven, Turbo Tabla 4, but there are so many others that really can help you work up a sweat!"
3,belly dance,"Ididn't like much this CD because the music is well known, a bit too much maybe, and even if it's new recording, there is no surprise at all except for the last drumming ."
3,number 1 and 3 are amazing,"I loved number one: ""Enta Omni Remix"" and number 3: ""Batwanni Beek REG Project"". I wish I could get more of their music. I didn't care about all the songs where there was an actual singer singing a song."
1,Horrible at best,"I was able to get through the first few chapters of this book. The story was not able to flow very well as the book is overrun with slang terms (he keeps interjecting to explain the meanings) that I swear he must have made up in his shower, b/c depending on what part of the states you are from you will not understand. It is a typical tale of a hustler on lockdown who has Ms. Perfect (educated, intelligent, affluent with a great career) who hangs on his every word praying for the years to go by as she patiently waits for him to be released and get his ""legit hustle on"". It is also full of typos (who the heck proofreads these things). Unfortunately this book feeds into a lot of stereotypes about African Americans, but I suppose an upside to the situation could be that it at least has black folks reading (even if it is something from this junk-filled literary genre)."
1,Disappointed,"I am a real fan of ""urban drama"" novels and buy at least two every week. However, this book disappointed me terribly; it took me three weeks to read. What was missing? The grit? the street scene in full detail? I don't know, but I usually go through a book in two to three days. This one left me hungry for something else."
5,Cassie does quit...here is a rumor.,"I think the controller who finds out Cassie's secrets is the new Animorph. I also think he only lasts three books.Really, if KA ever sees this, is it true?"
2,no offense but it wasnt really that good,when i heard that cassie was going to quit on #19 i was thinking she might thought about it in a couple of chapters. but in the first chapter she quits. then she and a controller got lost in the woods and they tried to maked peace and then the yeerk letted the girl free because she morphed into a caterpiller. No offense but this sucked.
2,Cassie quits.,"First Cassie quits the animorphs. Then she and a controller get lost in the forest, were there is an escaped leopord. She becomes friends with the yeerk and lets it enter her. Then the yeerk goes back into Karen, it's old host. Then Cassie becomes a nothlit so the yeerk will free it's host. When Cassie becomes a nothlit she becomes a catipiller. After the cattipiller turns into a butterfly,she is able to demorph. I think it was stupid that Cassie, first becomes a willing controller then becomes a nothlit."
4,"It was a bit sad, but I loved it anyway!","Cassie decided to quit the ANIMORPHS, saves a little girl, and makes a deal with a yeerk who thinks a little like her. It is a bit sad, but I loved it."
1,Awesome! Excellent! Loved it!,"I really liked this book, but there were a few stupid parts. I mean, when Cassie saved the kid from a bear? The kid swinging by her fingertips from a tree, and Cassie grabbing her while on the horse is like something from a cheap movie. Also, I would have written the ending...well, just plain cooler. I would have had the Ellimist tell Cassie to go ahead and morph the caterpillar and tell her how she would be able to morph out. Then she would have became a butterfly, and demorphed and walked into school, and have Jake, Rachel, and Marco freaking out. That would be cool."
5,This book totally ROCKS!,This book is great! Cassie quits because she is tired of killing hosts along with the Yeerks. She gives up her body so a host named Karen can live a life without a Yeerk in her head. This is all I will tell. My suggestion....GET THIS BOOK!
5,New Animorph & book 19,"First of all, the Controller Cassie gets lost with is a girl. And the new Animorph is HUMAN, A MALE, AND EVIL. K.A. Applegate said this herself. Secondly, I doubt Cassie will quit for good, but I can't wait to see what she does to the Controller. Hey, maybe she'll just keep locked up somewhere for 3 days or until the Yeerk in her head dies...wait that wouldn't work because she'll remember Cassie's secret and if she's captured by the Yeerks again the Yeerk in her brain will know about the Animorphs. Sadly, the only way I see to keep the Animorphs' secret is to kill the Karen, the Controller. Anyway, this book sounds really good. When I get it, I'll make sure to post a review here."
5,# 19 is Morphinominal!!!!!,"The way Cassie tried to make piece with a Yeerk was amazing. I never would of thought there were such things as good Yeerks. The sacrafice Cassie made was incredible! Sort of suprised me when I read about the naturally-occuring morphing. ""Animorphs"" is my favorite book series."
4,Adorable Book,"We have a maple sugaring operation and it has been fun to have a story about this time of year. It is my goal to have a bunch of kids books available for my grandchildren for each season. Christmas is easy, but maple season is harder to find."
5,I'm Back!,I just recently moved. While unpacking I noticed my Gerald Levert Private Line cassette tape. I tried to play it and guess what happened...the tape recorder at my tape. I just received my CD two days ago from Amazon and realize why I purchased the CD in the first place. I absolutely love it. This will be one of my CD's I will not lend out to anyone! I love it that much. Gerald's silky voice can not be duplicated. I wish they still made music like this.I'm Back!
5,Loving Gerald,"This album is what got me into Gerald, from then on I became a fan of Gerald's. This album has all great tracks, I listen to the whole album and I purchased it when it was on cassette and I still listen to it today. ""Shooting the Breeze, and ""Can you handle it"" was two of my favorites, along with ""hugs and kisses"" and ""Just because I'm wrong"" is just the bomb!!! I loved every track as well as the musician and I will always love Gerald and miss him from the bottom of my heart."
2,Nice Idea..bad fit,"This would be an really cool product if it fit properly. It looks great on the Cingular 8125. The problems come it when you try to keep the case on the phone. The case hooks onto the 8125, which let it slide open and close, but the hooks are too loose on the phone and the case has a tendancy to slip out of place. The case is also fairly bulky and makes an already large phone seem even larger. I give it two stars because it still manages to protect the phone from bumbs."
3,My doesn't taste fresh,"The expiration date is still months away since I received this product. The chocolate cover taste good. However, may be because of the oil in the peanut, it tastes old/little stale. M&M peanut chocolate is similarly made and doesn't have this problem."
2,Save up for something better,"Extremely disappointed with this futon. Did not expand and is several inches too short for the platform. Loose clumps of stuffing everywhere and does not ""spring back"" as advertised. My cat put a indent in it after a short nap and it has yet to regain it's shape. I was trying to be mindful of budget when purchasing this futon- unfortunately you get what you pay for in this case. Hoping it was just a fluke."
2,Not that great.,"The pad arrives significantly compressed from shipping (it ships rolled and tied tightly with twine and wrapped in plastic sheeting), and then goes downhill from there. Maybe if you can pick it up yourself from a retail store, and handle it carefully, it won't fall flat. But don't have this shipped, unless you like sleeping on something that feels like sleeping on a floor--a thickly carpeted floor, but the floor nonetheless. Not the plush, many years of comfort, comfy futon pad advertised. We've had ours for just over 6 months, in use by my less than 45 pound daughter, and the pad is less than 5"" thick now. (And that's in the corner near the wall where only her stuffed rabbit has been sleeping!)If you're desperate, and don't have much $$$, then this is better than nothing. But I won't buy another one. I'll go get a cheap-o synthetic foam pad that will be far more comfortable and durable that this. It's a nice idea, but doesn't work."
2,Plush-not so,"I have slept on the 9 inch ""plush"" for 2 nights now and have hada back ache each morning. The mattress is hard!! The 9 inch is not 9, maybe 6 or 7."
1,what a backache!,"Maybe I just got a ""lemon"" but after a couple weeks, this futon was very flat in the middle where I slept, so that I could feel the my frame's wooden slats underneath. The sides were still fluffy, so it was very concave and I ended up with a backache... I tried flipping it, etc., but it was hopeless so I went back to the old futon that this was meant to replace."
3,Young Dean looking for his Music,"This four CD set from Proper Music shows the promise that the young ""Dino"" had. The overall problem with this set is that the Young Dean Martin did not have anyone at his record company looking after his musical career. A fine young voice is wasted on many mediocre songs like ""Wham Bam thank you Mam"" or ""Happy Feet"" or Hominy Grits"" or ""Aabamy Bound"". Dean Martin apparently was no Music Maven like his buddy Frank Sinatra. This set is probably only deserable for the serious Dean Martin fan who wants a complete collection of Dino diddies."
3,rims and outer parts are flymsy plastic,Came in a day--- that was great- but dissapointed when we got it- noticed bent rear wheel assembly and outer plastic parts- metal frame........ this will not hold up for our younger ones later
3,Trnasformer Bumble Bee Bike,I bought this bike for my six years old. Really a nice bike. Only problem shipment had a faulty nut. I have contacted manufacturer and they promised a replacement part.
3,ok but not worth the price,"I bought this bike for my 5 year old who loves everything yellow. The bike is sturdy construction in the frame and nice rims. However, all of the extras that you are spending the extra money on like the hand guards, fender, hand breakes, and face plate are REALLY flimsy and did not last after the first few crashes. I received the first bike with several broken parts and a scratched frame. Amazon did send me a new one right away but it still had scratches on it and flimsy parts. It looks good and rides nice but is not worth $30 more than any other 16inch bike."
4,Transformer Bike,"This bike looks awesome, easy to put together, durable bike for the price! however, had problems with the shipment, training wheel was broken."
5,Makes a huge difference,"I use of the the EZcubes for photographing cameras and other setups to use as illustrations in my books. It does a fantastic job of softening the light so images are clear and sharp without burned out gighlights and black, detailess shadows. It's as if the subject being photographed is bathed in the light. I was so taken with it that I started using it to photograph wildflowers. The resulkts were equally amazing."
4,Great but expensive...,"I purchased this over the CowboyStudio light tent because it included a DVD. The instructional DVD did not have much useful information. Most of the tips were geared for people who have absolutely no experience with lighting or photography. Other than that, it works great so far. In hindsight, I probably would have purchased a less expensive light tent."
1,Just Trouble,I installed McAfee Virus Scan and developed intermittent problems with other software. It also occasionally prevented the printer from working and disabled Cookie Cop. I have since used AVG (free program) and Norton AntiVirus with no problems.McAfee's support was terrible.
1,DON'T BUY THIS,I'm on my second day of trying to get this installed. It's the WORST experience I've ever had with software. It caused my computer to crash several times. First time I installed the Home Edition didn't appear. I had to uninstall/reinstall. Then the Firewall didn't appear. Had to do same thing. Then...on and on.
1,Big mistake,"I had McAfee version 7 on my computer for one year. I updated to Version 8 according to their instructions and have had nothing but problems since.Their technical support is all but non existent. Now I can't delete the software. It has an insert disk box popping up everytime the computer resarts, their shredder option has disappeared, I'm getting runtime script errors and I keep getting booted of my internet connection.Their only technical support is through email, chat or $2.95 aminute on the phone. I have gotten no where with the first two options. I can't afford to spend $2.95 a minute on the third option.They have apretty goood racket going. They sell you the product, don't take responsibility for it and then want to charge you to fix what they messed up."
1,"Never, never buy McAfee","The support is the worst you could ever concieveably imagine. The product is average, but it is the support that really makes this a one star. Imagine how much effort gets put into creating software if they're this lousy at communication."
5,Mcafee virusScan professional edition 7.0,"I has used it very good. It's protect to your computer against virus, spamkiller and everything... I love to spent it for a long time in my computer... Thank you for your McAfee virusScan and Amazon to introduction this production to everyone to install computer to protect them..."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was really looking for smaller placemats (vinyl). These are hard, pressed cardboard with a slippery laminate on top. Not only do they slide on the surface where they're resting, but whatever you put on them slides off as well. I do not recommend these for use, maybe for decoration only."
5,Great dual purpose top,I wore this as a maternity shirt (very stretchy). Then wore it to a wedding as a nursing shirt and I now wear it with my jeans around the house. Very comfortable and functional. Does not look like a maternity shirt. I will continue to wear this when I am done nursing.
5,Excellent book,This book is insightful and practical. It is challenging and inspiring at the same time. The only thing I would add is that I wish it had a chapter by chapter set of discussion questions.
1,Not a true size 8.,"There are lots of reasons to love these slippers, but size is not one of them.They're cute with their cable knit design.They're cozy with their interior fluff.They're practical with their treads on the bottom.They have one major design flaw, though. Their noted size is not a true one. This doesn't match any other shoe manufacturer in the US. Were these made in China, designed for bound feet? The opening does not allow the foot in more than an inch.Also, if you return these due to their poor sizing (i.e. too small), get ready to pay $$$$ for return shipping.Suddenly, Zappos is looking more attractive."
3,A REALISTIC PIECE!,"This book presents characters that are down-to-earth in realistic situations, demonstrating real-life emotions. I really liked this aspect because romance fiction is often dominated with characters and lifestyles beyond the realm of the average womyn."
5,WHAT A ADORABLE STORY A MUST HAVE,Great book my sons wants me to read him over and over again. It talks about school and play and feeling before you get on the stage much much more. YOU GOT TO HAVE IT!!!!
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I purchased this book expecting some much more than it delivered. I expected a complete and drawn out compendium of the Cthulhu Mythos, what I got was a confusing mesh mash of useless information. This weirdo was actually working on the premise that the Cthulhu cult is real or was real. Perhaps there members of the Cthulhu cult running around performing blaspemous rites. Who knows? If they are this book won't help you much."
2,good grief,"This heretical tome does nothing less than rob H.P. Lovecraft of the one thing he had in his life, his FICTION. Hear that folks? FICTION. So for all the pseudo satanists and poor drab souls who want to believe in the Necronomicon, knock yourselves out. You'll get your fill. If you enjoy Lovecraft's stories this will probably irk you the way it did me. IF Pelton existed, and IF he believed what he wrote than he would have been a great subject for a Lovecraft story, a poor deluded man who loses his sanity dealing with a subject he knows nothing about. If you are into role playing games however, I'm sure you can find some use for this. As for my copy, it does a passable job as a drink coaster for my end table."
5,Great book,"This was the final book in the series and one filled with constant action. What a Great Series of the STONGEST characters, an awesome storyline that smoothly went from on book to the next. This was one series, that the great writing made you Need to read on."
3,Fast read,A good rainy day read. I finished it a day. Good suspense. I would read the other stories in the series.
4,All's well that ends well!!,This last book kept anxious excitement alive. I'm thrilled at the ending. I was kept involved and couldn't put the book down. I would recommend this series to everyone.
5,the wicked one,This was a great book. Loved the action and romance of the book. Having lived in England for some time it was fun to imagine what it was like then. Would Highly recommend this book.Tammie Hoeksema
5,He is the most enticing character of the whole series!,"I was thrilled to know that Lucien had his own book. His character always intrigued me in every story of all his brothers. I think his own story was very well written. The plot was fantastic. The love scenes were really awesome. I was wondering how the author would pull it off with a character like Lucien, but as always, she did it! and did it well!This book did show a different side to Lucien-a little more ""human"" than he is portrayed in the other stories. While it was certainly necessary, in order to write his own love story, I think I prefer the cold, dark, ""super human"" and manipulative Lucien. I can't wait to see him again when the author writes the story of his sister!"
4,The Wicked One,"Great Read. Loved the series. Can't wait for the final one of the series, from America to England and France."
4,Wildly wicked,"The Wicked One was a good read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Lots of action, stubbornness and some funny moments thrown in. I am patiently waiting for their sisters turn now."
5,The Wicked One,I love Danelle work and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work in the future and finishing the rest of the De Montforte brother story;
3,Good enough,"But based on the earlier novels, I'm sure the author could have come up with something different - he deserved more!"
3,Could have been better,"The story could have used a bit more content and a bit less graphic sex. I didnt like the way the sisters story was just an back story with little thought of wrapping it up at the end. Also as often times happens with these stories the entire ending was rushed. Spoiler Alert! I didnt understand how Luciens bride awakes( after losing her baby, fleeing his control freak ways)discovers she loves him. That didnt fit with her previous mistrust of him."
3,Not my favorite of the De Montforte Brothers,"The Wicked One is the fourth book in the De Montforte Brothers series and it wasn't my favorite. The style was a little different than the first three books, which wasn't necessarily for the good. The constant sparring and one-upmanship between the Hero and heroine got a little old after while and the way they were forced into marriage was a bit thin for me. I did enjoy seeing how the other three brother's marriages were getting along. Overall this book wasn't bad, it's a nice romance, but I could've done with a little more romance and a little less constant fighting."
5,A truly enjoyable and exciting series.,"I began reading this caught up in all the excitement Lucien and Eva brought and got totally wrapped in their banter and energy. The many twists and frightening events held you rapt till it was a bittersweet thing to reach the end as you have to return to your day to day and refocus on the here and now.Thank you Ms Harmon for allowing me the escape into the world of the deMontforte brothers. I adore the many twists and turns, banter and Eva truly was a perfect match for our dear Lucien, I thoroughly enjoyed the series."
1,not much help to me,"I was relly hoping this would do more, but it caused me a lot of pain and hasn't been much help."
5,AMW,I found this as book as well as Enemy Glory fascinating. The intricate plot kept me deeply intrigued throughout. My favorite thing about these two books are the character development and the beautiful poetic writing style of Karen. I eagerly await more from Karen Michalson. Also----check out Lian Hearn
4,Collective Soul Returns!,"I will say this is not CS at their best but it definitely is a better album. Like they talk on their website this album is a return moreso to their formative years. This album has remnants of ""Blender"" in it but it reminds me of their self-titled album.""Counting the Days"" really is a good first single. It's totally different than previous first singles like ""Heavy"" from Dosage, or ""Why pt 2"" from Blender. The point I think was to hint at stylisticly the album. Strong songs like ""Him"", ""Satellite"", and ""Under Heaven's Skies"" add to my long list of good CS songs. ""better now"" and ""Perfect to stay"" are good CS rockers.Blender-like songs like ""Feels Like"" or ""There's a way"" are kind of unlikeable. Sometimes you can't block old stuff out.Bottom Line: A satisfying sixth album as albums go these days."
5,Well worth the Counting the Days till Youth arrived!,Absolutely awesome! It's been a long wait for this CD but the wait was well worth it. Every song has that unique Collective Soul sound to it. I love everything about this CD from the incredible lyrics to the music itself. There is so much energy to the music I can see why they named it Youth!! I can't wait to see them perform these songs live!
5,Amazing!,I love every single song on this cd! Ed is a truly amazing song writer. I bought the cd on November 16th and haven't played another cd since. I can't stop listening to it. You won't be disappointed.
3,A Classic Under-achievement,"An album that could've been great from a band that could've been great. Collective Soul seems to be a classic under-achiever. They've got brilliant moments, but they are sparse. It seems they're happy having a couple of radio hits, and that's about it. I wanted to groove with this record, but 1 of the songs consists of 1 verse, and no change at all in 3 minutes. The few tunes that have bridges are very predictable. There's nothing fresh when it comes to songwriting craft on this record. Just straight ahead pop that everyone's heard before. Good to listen to, but won't make anyone do backflips, except the few unreasonable die-hard fans."
5,Sa-weet as ever.,"I have every Collective Soul studio album, and I think that Youth ties for the best along with some of their others. They've never released anything that I thought was bad....but I'll admit that Blender wasn't as good as Collective Soul's capable of. Youth is a return to form for one of the best rock groups of recent times. It's got a fresh, new sound...but at the same time sounds like the Collective Soul you know and love. This cd is a must buy for any Collective Soul fan, and a good pick up for anybody that enjoys rock music of any style. Thanks guys for giving us fans a little more!"
3,OK Solid album...not great tho',"This record doesn't rate more than a middling score since most of it is rather forgettable after you turn off the CD. I got hooked on their debut album back in the 90's; it was the perfect soundtrack to my college years. Unfortunately this album sounds slicker and more pop than I remember.Oh, I noticed that David Bowie wasn't credited for ""Better Now"" when he should be since the song is basically a (bad) retread of ""Suffragette City.""""Wham, bam, thank you ma'am!"""
1,Collective SELL-OUT,Worst album by a formerly great band I've ever heard. This album is Pop-lite garbage.
1,GIVE IT UP,"I truley think this band needs to give it up! I think December is the only even half way decent Collective Soul song that I know. They are trying to be too main stream, all of their stuff sounds exactly the same!"
3,Collective Soul--Youth,"I am a huge Collective Soul fan, and I love everything they do; however this disc left me thinking that it is more of the same style of music as their last album. The first two songs on the disc are excellent, but the rest is sort of flat, and has been done already on ""Dosage"" and ""Blender"". Good quality, just not the innovative sound I was hoping for."
5,Youth ROCKS!,"I got my copy of Youth and have been listening to it ever since.Its worth the wait, its got THAT collective soul touch to it.All the songs are lovely, My personal Favorite is Satellite and Better Now. Its time Collective Soul gets the recognition they have deserved for soooooo long!"
4,If you like Collective Soul..BUY IT!,"I do not pretend to be a music critic, so let me just say that I really like this CD. I own all of Collective Souls music and I think this is as good as most of them.It is easy listening for me..I am well into adulthood..and sometimes don't like but one or two songs on most CDs. But this one, I skip past nothing."
4,Welcome Back!,"Thanks to digital locker, I've been listening to this CD for over a month now. It's truly a great CD from begining to end. In my opinion, it's a lot more pop-oriented, commercial, and listener-friendly than their typically 'heavy' rock material. They still have the same distinct sound that us fans have grown to love, it just doesn't have the same hard edge found on previous recordings. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that...bottom line is, it's still great music to listen to. Highly recommended...you wont' be disappointed.There are a few gems on this CD, yet I still don't think there's anything 'ground-breaking' here, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I think this is truly a great CD, a nice way to get back into the groove, but they're only scratching the surface right now. This band is extremely talented and continually growing and improving with each new venture. I assure you that the next CD will REALLY blow us away."
2,Not their best...,"I own all of Collective Soul's CDs and I love them all. I bought this one the day it came out and have been listening to it since to try to have it grow on me. I don't like this album. I can't name one song I like. Nothing stands out on it. I was so dissapointed. I was expecting so much more. My favorite CDs of theirs is ""Collective Soul"" - I love almost every song on that CD. This one is NOTHING like it."
1,Was Ross Childress really that important?,"I hate to say it, but CS has lost their magic. Whether Ross Childress really meant that much or not, who knows, but this album sucks. Everything is so basic and boring, and Roland's lyrics have just become, well, uggh! It doesn't even seem like he's really trying. Just pumping out the albums to make a few bucks. I really am sorry for all those fans that are living in a bubble, still thinking that this band is doing anything good at all anymore. Face it. They hit their peak at Dosage and have been declining ever since."
3,Better Now is the Closest thing to Gel,"When I popped in this CD, Better Now attacked my speakers like a stripped down Bowie song. The horns are a great addition to the normally tech sounding riffs of CS. The album overall is strong, I just wish they would dump all of the cheesey ballads which I never liked (I understand that others love them) If they would go for a full album of hard-powered rock tunes, they would reestablish themselves as one of the only survivors from the 90's (with Green Day, Foo Fighters)"
5,Youth Review,It seems that CS is a band that just never has a bad song and therefore doesn't put out a bad album. They keep getting better and their sound keeps getting more varied and mature. This is a fun one.
5,Collective Soul is Rock & Roll,"Collective Soul once more hits the mark with their unstoppable album, ""Youth"". The sad, but true fact is there are very few actual rock bands out there making albums. Sad only because rock seems to be in a state of slow and ugly decay. But we can rejoice in the fact that Collective Soul is carrying the torch and it is burning at full flame. There is not one single throw-away track on this album. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a throw-away track on any of their past five albums as well. When other bands have bowed down to the record execs and sold out their musical passions for the almighty buck, these guys have given the pencil-pushers the ""collective"" finger and hustled into the studio to create solid, no-frills Rock & Roll. Run, don't walk...and buy good Rock while it lasts!"
3,Where's the Rock,"There seems to be two types of Collective Soul fans out there, those of us who are fans of rock and roll and those of us who think were fans of rock and roll because we listen lots of U2, and other even more POP-rock type bands.The greatest, by far, CS album is the self titled second release, followed by Hints and Disciplined breakdown.For real rock and roll fans we see another Collective Soul album that is overproduced and far too bubblegum to gets us rocking like like we could to songs like Gel or Where the river flows.That being said Ed Roland can still sing like no ones business, Counting the Days rocks and not a single song is bad. Pop rock fanes and die hard Collective Soul fans should get it, but not those hopping to rock out to great guitarr riffs like on albums of the past."
