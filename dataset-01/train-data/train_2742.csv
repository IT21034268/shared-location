1,wrong item,"Unfortunately, I haven't received a saucer (which i found very cute on the seller picture) but a small plate which looks like the one you use as a base for a coffee mug.I could understand that in the bigger order there may be one incorrect item, but in an order of just one item it should never happened. As I'm looking for a good wedding gift for my friend I've ordered the saucer in order to see and touch the Portmeirion Botanic Garden item - of which I heard to have beautiful floral design - before I make the bigger order. Well, the plate has no floral design at all.I wished I have ordered the kitchen clock or the garden salad servers from another seller.I wrote to the seller to pick up the item and to fully refund both the item price payed and the shipping cost I just don't want to waist more time.I'll make the update on the seller feedback and time it took."
2,4 years for this?!,"1. I don't know who mastered this album but is has the worst sound quality I've heard in a very long time. For example, you can faintly hear the high hats and cymbals but the (mediocre) congo playing comes through loud, if not clearly.2. This album features a ton of, well about 5, guest artists that exists seemingly to only water down the music even further. You should also be a fan of (amateur)horn playing because there are more horns on this album than any previously.3. This album never gets going. They have, for the most part, abandoned ther funk/ soul style and are trying to play a more straight ahead style of jazz of which many other groups play much better.4. 2 stars - because it's better than nothing."
5,Try to Find This Book,"The complicated relationship between Adrian Hunt and Christina Bowers is one of the most interesting and passionate relationships in the Romance genre. It's not really a conventional romance novel. It breaks a lot of ""rules"". But both characters are amazingly drawn out and they are perfect for each other. She can hold up against him and never loses her dignity or her strength of character. He is just a dream come true. This book is written lovingly with a swift moving story, no dead spots, excellent love scenes, a nice element of mystery and a highly emotional fast-paced conclusion. In a year I will read it again. I love her writing, no matter what name she is operating under."
5,Best Romance Novel,"Loved this book from the first page to the last page. Wished there was a sequel to the story of Adrien and Christine. Don't bother with anything else this author published though, nothing compares to Starlit Surrender."
1,Not worth the money or time,"I am a clinical psychologist and have been in practice for over 20 years. This book is primarily about the side effects of medications with very little practical advice on maintaining relationships during depression. There are far, far better books on the market on this topic with practical help in them. A good therapist can tell you the points in this book in five minutes. Don't waste your money here."
4,Good but not like the original Dr.Seuss,"My son loves this DVD, but not very long so I think he did get tired of it after awhile. It is puppet type Dr.Suess characters including the cat and the hat of course, it has cute stories, but they aren't original stories. I think Horton's baby from Horton hatches an egg is in it, which I thought was kind of cute. Good for kids, adults might not enjoy it as much, because its not the original stuff."
5,She loves it!!,"We bought this video on sale and I got it because my daughter was 3 months at the time and I thought the black, red and white would stimulate her a little. Now at 4 months she laughs and coos' and kicks her legs in excitment.....She loves this video, the colors are so vibrant, and when we take her away from it she starts to get a little fussy. I only let her watch it for 15 minutes a day but she would watch it all day if I let her."
5,Exceeded my Expectations,"This book is exactly what I was hoping for. The Case Study was extremely helpful. The book blends nicely and complements his last book - ""Establishing a System of Policies and Procedures"". The self-assessment checklists play well into our environment where we have to calculate outcome studies to display positive/negative implementation results. Chapter 4, Establishing a Communication Strategy, was very informative being a common breakdown point in any organization, especially whenapplied to Policies and Procedures.We will be purchasing more of these books in the near future."
1,Very boring book,I had stared reading this a few weeks ago and had just finished it. I love time travle stories (I have a few on my bookshelf). But this one was a disappointment. I really found Casey the MOST ANNOYING heroine in the story. She was so obsessed of having Luke 'father' her child throughout 2/3 of the story. Hardly any romance and too much science. This was a waste of my money. I hope the next book I read of hers will be better than this.
2,Disappointing,"I have read every one of this authors books and enjoyed them immensely. Until, this one. This is the most boring book i have read in a long time. The story has no substance. All the main character does is whine about having been brought back in time. There is nothing to this book. Save your money!!!!"
2,Very disappointing book,"I have read several of this writer's books and really enjoyed them. So I was suprised at this book. The central characters are almost unlikeable, definitely boring and lack depth. I also didn't care for all the New Age references, it didn't seem to fit. I would advise against buying this book. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't much."
4,Seriously loved it!,"After I started reading this book ""Heaven on Earth by Constance O'Day Flannery, I just couldn't put it down. Every pages filled with excitment and adventure. I like the message that the author had given us that we all have our own destiny like Luke and Casey. They're destined to meet but the odd is that they met in a strange situation--""time traveling"". The only confusing part of this book in my opinion is that the author wrote too much about science and new age stuff. Even though, she tried to explain them as simple as possible but still...science is hard to understand. Especially about time traveling that includes an explanation about atoms and such. But overall, I recommend this book for it was not at all as boring as it seems."
3,Heaven On Earth,"Great time travel story, however, unlike Ms. O'Day Flannery's other books, a little drawn out. Spanish culture was a good change of pace tho. This was a book you could put down and not be overly anxious to pick up, unfortunately."
4,Heavy on New Age themes,"Constance O'Day-Flannery knows how to write an excellent time travel. The premise of Heaven on Earth--time travel with a hunk of an ""angel""--is enough to give the reader delicious shivers. However, the story gets bogged down in the preaching of New Age themes (even if the hero does claim they are timeless truths). This book will either speak to the reader, or make her roll her eyes. She'll have to determine that for herself."
2,Not like racing&#65533;more like slot cars,"I must agree with ramair350's review. I was expecting it to be a handheld version of what I play on my laptop (Nascar 2002) or Playstation 2 (Nascar Thunder), sitting behind the wheel or just above and behind, getting a real sensation of racing a stock car and being a part of the race. This GameBoy Advance version is like an animated version of my old HO scale slot car racing and very disorienting to try and control the car. What a waste of money!"
3,Not my favorite shampoo,"Even though this product claims to be moisturizing, I found it a little drying. It's nothing special. There are better volumizing products out there."
2,Didn't work for me,Left my hair very dry. Thankfully it didn't cost too much. Am disappointed it didn't work. I also used the conditioner and serum.
3,Headlines,"Not that effective, and not real value fr money. But some people I shared this with seemed to like it"
2,Rock n Roll Legends-Johnny Tillotson,"Not what we thought it was going to be. It was a series of short clips from a variety of performances over the years by Johnny Tillotson. I guess we expected more. Like interviews with him, more variety in his performances, chronology of his career, ect. We were disappointed."
5,My husband's comment on The Cyclist's Food Guide,"""I find the book to be an excellent information source on nutrition and energy requirements for cycling, and wish I had it when I began biking in earnest some 15 years ago."""
1,COOL,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'AM WRITING A REVIEW.FIRSTLY I LIKED THIS MOVIE ONLY BECAUSE OFDumb and Dumber WHO IS A great comedyflick that is one of the few films i can watch again and again youhave to like jim carey though, i know some people cant stand him)The long kiss godnight is not a bad film either but not worthy of more than one or two viewings. A good idea for a film though.As for the other two :( Well they do show off your player and some of the special effects and fight scenes are great but at the end of the day theyll stay on the shelf END"
2,I don't recommend it,"I bought this book because it says it explains both the BS1 and BS2. Only a couple of pages at the beginning are dedicated to explain the Most Basic commands of both BS1 & 2. Almost the rest of the book are complex example programs (projects) with a LOT of commands which were not explained before. I don't recommend this book, specially if you're planning to use other than the BS1.It would have been a much better book if the author dedicated more time explaining all the commands and what they do, instead of putting so many examples which are hard to understand without this knowledge."
5,Reccomended,"Well writen, easy to follow intor to the basic stamp. I enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it to others like myself who wanted an easy intro to the stamps."
1,this book was so bad i think i got aids from it,"this is the worth book i have ever had the pleasure to put in the trash (the only place where it belongs) 3 pages showing a photo of a potentiometer and the constant nagging of buying things from to person who wrote the book (he calls himself an ""AUTHOR"") he should call himself a salesperson. the book is aimed at the mentally challanged, it has such a slow pace , i felt i was in a movie with slow playback, and most of the crap was not complete.Do your self a favor dont waste your money if you want a sales catalog, just call any electronics vendor and you will get one for free (including shipping)"

1,Typical Steve Jackson Rip-Off,"This edition of the Principia Discordia is obviously a total rip-off. Written by Steve Jackson? Gimme a break. Do a search and buy the original by the originals.Principia Discordia, Or, How I Found Goddess and What I Did to Her When I Found Her: The Magnum Opiate of Malaclypse the YoungerOr read it for nothing online. Either way, don't drop any cash into Steve Jackson's gaping maw or risk offending Hir Erisness vewy vewy much!"
4,Funny!,He's got his own style: Like Bill Cosby on crack! I can't wait to see more material from him!
4,this is funny,I laughed so hard I cried. No Bull. It's not easy to make me laugh this hard. Eddie Murphy & Richard Pryor have and now John Witherspoon.
5,"5pc Vise grips. GREAT, HANDY, Durable for all jobs","This 5 pc set is well worth the money, Irwin is a great brand and these vise grips are a great representation of their quality."
5,Lovely study,Outstanding study related to issues of narrative in interaction. Volume arrived in great condition. A great addition to my library.
1,"Ok at first, but went downhill fast.","When I was first given this block as a gift we liked it. It was a little difficult getting out bigger knifes all the way into the block but they eventually made it down after a few repositions. After a few weeks the larger knifes never made it all the way in and the block would no longer fit under the cabinets with the knifes sticking out. Then after dealing with that for about a year, the wood broke in half and everything fell out. We may have had too many knifes in it but it shouldn't have broken the wood in half. If you are utilizing smaller knifes than this would be fine, but the longer and wider the knifes the worse it is."
3,Deteriorates over time...,"Initially...great! Fits all sizes of knifes, sharpeners, appliances.But...with time and use, for some reason I haven't full investigated, the utensils don't slide in as easily and it gets harder to use. The knives still slide in, but not to the level of the handle like they used to. Not sure I'd re-purchase one, once this one becomes unusable."
1,Useless in a couple of years; don't buy,"I finally gave up and threw our Kapoosh knife holder away. It worked great for about a year, and then it became increasingly difficult to push the knife into the holder. I took it apart tonight and discovered why. Over time, the thin metal rods inside bend and crinkle, making it impossible to push the knives in even part way. There isn't any way to fix it. What a waste of money. I have tried ""kapoosh.com"" several times over the last several months to complain to the manufacturer, but the webpage is inactive. Don't buy it."
1,Won't last for the long haul,"Although this knife holder is a good idea, it has a major flaw- it won't last. I have owned one for almost four years, and it started getting bent and jammed after just 12 months. Basically, I think the problem is that when you put knives in the holder, the spaces between the plastic rods get tighter and tighter. So, when you load several knives into the holder, the rods get so tight that every time you put in a knife, it jams some rods down and bends them. Over time, the rods get so bent and tangled that you can no longer put knives down more than a few inches. I store the following knives (which started wearing out the Kapoosh in just 12 months): 2 chef's knives, a long narrow filet knife, a bread knife, a long serrated knife, a utility knife, and 2 paring knives. Now, my holder is so jammed I have to throw it out. So, it's a good idea- but save your money and get a knife holder that will last longer."
5,Kapoosh,"These things are great!!! I have three and don't use the original knife holder that came with my knives. They hold tons of knives, scissors and my steel. Reccommend to everyone. Also, Bed BATH and Beyond says this style is no longer being made so if you already own one and want another to match you'd better get now before they run out."
2,"awesome idea, poor/mediocre execution","Amazing idea, but several flaws keep me looking for alternatives to my hodgepodge knifes:- it only holds knives 8 inches long. Bread knives, slicing knives, and some chef knives stick out.- the block's angle is *much* steeper than others -- about 60 degree angle versus my slotted block's 45 degree. This means I can't keep it under a cabinet -- a very big negative. The extra angle means my slotted block is 3-4 inches shorter than the Kapoosh (but is the same length along the hypotenuse) and the knifes' handles are held more horizontally than the Kapoosh.Knives go in effortlessly and stay where you put them, no matter the insertion angle.If they would both make the plastic filaments extend all the way to the block's bottom to allow 10 inch knives and flatten the angle to allow cabinet clearance, this would be a keeper."
2,Fixable - with a lot of work,"This product is great for a while, then gets worse and worse. Company doesn't sell a replacement brush block. I've had two of these. So I took a tip from another reviewer.I removed the insert block and took a large pair of shears to cut off many of the tines at their bottom. I clipped away about 1/4 inch from the outside edge of all the tines. Basically that relieves the pressure inside, and I'm able to use the block again.It's not an easy solution, but it did work. The company should simply sell a replacement for the bristles block for say, $15, and I'd keep buying them."
3,"Good for first first year, but then...","It's a great concept to have a knife block that will hold any size knife or tool. The inner material is comprised of thousands of plastic rods, but over time as knives go in and out those little rods bend, which then make it difficult to get the knives in. Only a few paring knives will now go in all the way, the others only go half way leaving them exposed. I've tried to cut the bad rods out but there are now just too many and it's too difficult to find them all. It was a good block for 1-2 years, but now I need to replace."
1,block split,"As others have mentioned, I noticed it was getting harder and harder to insert my knives. Then last night it split up the back. I'm looking for a traditional block now. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Honeymoon's over,"Absolutely wonderful, for about six months. Then it got tougher and tougher to get larger knives to go in. I finally removed the Wonder Rods and found that large, sharp knives bend some of them over permanently down low in the block, and they prevent large blades from going in. Too bad, thirty bucks shot in the head."
3,It's an idea with potential...,"Only problem is, my Global knives are very good at shredding the tops of those rods as they go in! Then again, a stronger material would probably scratch the blades.Still though, I'd rather have a traditional slotted block than have to worry about finding little bits of those rods in my food."
1,block split,"I have had two of these - each lasted about eight months, than the block split. Its cool, but not a practical product until they re-engineer it. I did not over stuff it."
4,Say goodbye to old fashioned knife blocks!,"This is a fabulous kitchen accessory and oh so helpful when you have little drawer and counter space! Standard knife blocks hold what? A dozen or so knives, plus steak knives sometimes? This thing really lives up to it's promise! I currently have 12 knives in the block and there's room for more than twice that! I was a little disappointed with the kapoosh insert; some of the rods stick up about a half inch higher than the rest, which was slightly disturbing. However, now that it has some knives in it's no big deal. Plus, it's really silly to return it just because the one corner is uneven when all the pros outweigh the one issue by FAR!"
5,"At Last!!! a practical, inexpensive knife holder!","I LOVE it! It holds many more knives than the traditional knife block, it is more compact, and the silicone filament ""innards"" can be removed and put in the dishwasher to keep it clean, and it keeps knives sharp!I just bought a second one at Amazon.com for half the price that I paid for the first one!!"
2,Not an ideal knife block,"I own this item. I doesn't hold as many knives as I thought it would and the large knives (bread knife/chef knife) blades stick out too much for my liking. Also, I don't like how the sharpening steel or a pair of scissors fits in it. I used it for almost three years and recently the wood case broke along one of the sides. I will try a traditional knife block next."
1,"Great for a few months, then worthless","Agree with others (see abovee). Terrific idea. Works great for a while, then the rods get bent and it becomes more or less worthless."
1,Great concept but flawed design,"I've had this block for two years. Great at first but nearing one year out, knives became harder to insert and I removed the rod insert to clean the unit. It was impossible to reinsert all the way into the block. Then the block split open along one edge. Although I reglued it, the rods could not go in without splitting it again. I no longer use this and would never again purchase one"
2,"Good start, bad finish",The idea of this product is great. Unfortunately the execution isn't. After a few months of use it gets more difficult to put the knives back in. It can be a real struggle to get the knives in making it a little dicey to use in the end. Loved the fact you could clean it but I'm having trouble pulling out the rods now to do so.Maybe they could come out with an updated version that works better but as is this is pretty disappointing.
2,Too Shallow,"While this is a very cool product, don't expect to put a knife with a blade longer than 7 inches into it. They quote 8"", but 7 is more realistic as it gets tighter the deeper you go. As such, my slicer, bread knife and chef knives didn't fit. I returned it because it didn't work with my collection; maybe one day they'll release a 12"" model."
1,Frustrating,"Ok, whoever rates this higher than 2 stars is merely looking for ""knife storage"". Anyone who actually uses this (with sharp knives) will experience the same frustration in a short amount of time.I couldn't agree more with what S_in_Seattle wrote, they're right on target:""The knife block is great at first. After awhile the rods get bent backwards and it becomes harder and harder to put knives in. In my opinion it becomes a safety hazard. The larger knives don't go in all the way. When you pull out a smaller knife you run the risk of cutting the tops of your fingers. I'm throwing ours out and getting a standard knife block.""Another thing I'd like to add is that it holds the knives at a rather steep angle. We'd have to move the block out from under the cabinets because we couldn't easily access the knives, then push it back after we're finished. Minor issue, but annoying.I am now in the market to buy a more ""standard"" block."
2,only ok,"Good idea, but overall quality seems poor. Finish looks cheap. My 8"" chef knife sticks out by about an inch. I may be able to push further in, but I do not want to chip my blade tip. I think I will take back, and try a storage bag. I must admit it is a good price, but not what I am looking for."
5,Kapoosh,I received a Kapoosh over a year ago and everyone who sees it wants it. All of the knives that were in a drawer are now in the Kapoosh. Young boys are fascinated by it andwant to rearrange the knives. I always tell them to knock themselves out! Then I turn around and buy one for their mother so they can do the same thing in their house. The cost of shipping is a bit out of whack since they're so heavy but it's a great product!
4,pretty good item,"i'm pretty happy with it, no real negatives, i only had it for a month. so far, so good!"
5,kapoosh.....,Love this product! I have many knives from different sets that I have collected over the years & this holder is perfect for them because there is no set number of slots or specific sized knives that will fit. This one holds them all plus scissors and whatever else! It's a little taller than I expected but it fits nicely on my kitchen counter just the same.
3,not fit for thick & big knife,"I get this item not in a perfect condition. On side of the shell was tackless that I have to stick it together myself. After three week use I found it is easy to use but not fit for big and thick knife which I bought it for. If you put a thick knife such as Chinese Chife Knife ([...]), you will find the small and thin black stick in the holder is easy to bent and make the knife can not reach the end of the holder."
5,"Great Idea, Universal knife block","Finally a knife block that can hold all of those different knives. I have owned one for many years and it was stolen from me, during a move. So I will be buying another one. I have never had any problems with my knife block, except that I am without one at the moment. I stored steak knives at the bottom and the rest above without any problem. I never had any problems with the rods inside. My longer knifes I just stuck them into the block with the blade side up, so when you go to grab a knife you won't get cut and have never had a problem. Overall rating A+... My parents loved the idea so much they got one too. Can't wait to get my new one."
1,Great at first,The knife block is great at first. After awhile the rods get bent backwards and it becomes harder and harder to put knives in. In my opinion it becomes a safety hazard. The larger knives don't go in all the way. When you pull out a smaller knife you run the risk of cutting the tops of your fingers. I'm throwing ours out and getting a standard knife block.
1,Good for about a year,"Great concept - this block fits my Asian knives and others that do not fit into a traditional knife block. With only average use it had problems after about a year and will be discarded as soon as it can be replaced. Apparently the black filaments bend and break so that it becomes impossible to insert a knife even using a lot of force. Once I removed the black part, carefully straightened all the bent rods and cut off the ones that could not be straightened, but this was only a temporary fix. Now it can only take two knives, forced in along the side edges, which can only go in part way. Forcing them in is probably dulling the blades, also. All in all, a disappointment!"
3,it works,"the blade worked, but you'll get one or two cuts and then the blade will need to be thrown away"
3,Rusted blade,"This oyster knife is very easy to use, even for a newbie like me. I like how it fits in the palm, and prefer the long, more narrow blade. However, the blade rusted like crazy after I washed it! I did not know that it was untreated steel. There should have been a warning on the packaging to hand wash and dry quickly. It is still usable after cleaning with steel wool but does not look as good as when I got it."
3,If only Ian would shut up,"Hey, this D.V.D is pretty awesome....its a little annoying cuz when they get interviewed they say THE SAME FREAKING THINGS OVER AND OVER. I loved the videos and stuff.....but I wish Ian would shut up cuz he thinks hes funny when hes really not. I would borrow this one from a friend.....don't invest your money."
5,A New Found Glory = good times & dumb ideas,"If you like New Found Glory, you need this dvd. It includes The Story So Far (46 min) all the music videos (Head On Collision, My Friends Over You, Dressed To Kill, Hit Or Miss, and the original Hit Or Miss) and a very funny bonus feature from about three years ago.(44 min.) Its like watching home movies of your favorite band!"
2,Get one of the higher models instead.,"I've been using this torch head occasionally for a year. I use it mostly to caramelize the sugar on creme brulee, scorch pepper skin, crisp up salmon skin, etc. While it eventually gets the job done, it's a real pain to use.The main problem is that there is no pressure regulator, so that the flame constantly goes out when the head is pointed downward. I have to be very careful how much I tilt the head, but it always goes out eventually. I end up having to raise the food above the head to sear it properly. I'm really fed up with this torch and am ready to upgrade.There are models like the Powercell, TS3000, TS4000 and TS7000 which can be used in any position because hey have a pressure regulator (as far as I understand). They also have self-ignition, so you don't have to hunt for your flame starter. The Powercell and TS7000 also allow you to control the output level better than on this pencil head."
3,Basic Torch,"I've been using this torch for about 6 months for my jewelry hobby. It does the job but does have issues with going out and being difficult to adjust the flame down without it going out. There is also a lag between turning off the valve and the flame going out that I don't like. It may be I got a defective unit. I prefer the propane fuel torch as it is much cheaper to use the $3 throwaway cylinders than refill a small butane torch. Now I wish I had not bought it an got the ST900D Mini Torch instead. Too bad that model has been discontinued - I would like to have the hose and interchangable tips.I am sure for other applications - like plumbing, that it would work fine."
1,Final Exit,"I am very dissappointed that a book like this can so easily be purchased. This book was found, and the video, at my sisters appartment, where she read, step by step, how to commit suicide. We as the family, would like books like this to be avilable to people that are terminally ill... not a 24 year old, beautiful young woman, that had her whole life ahead of her!!!"
5,Great Book,"This book is a great collection of Asimov's robot stories. Robot Visions was intended to be a companion to Robot Dreams. Both collections have older stories with a few new ones written for the book. You can really tell how Asimov thought about his beloved creation, the robots. The various stories show every point of view possible, from a robot's view or a man's. In the back of the novel, Asimov wrote several essays explaining his views on robotics. Definately a pleasurable read, whether you are a sci-fi fan or not."
5,A realistic view of robots in the future,Wonderful book! It is my most favorite book. His visions of the future are neither disparaging nor overly glossy. The robots seem like actually people instead of being cold metallic objects. It is a must read for anyone who wants to read about robots!
3,The Acidic Susan Calvin,"I like Asimov generally, but Susan Calvin has got to be his worst protagonist -- she's arch, acerbic, narrow-minded, and rarely bearable in any form. Its a shame she figures in so much of his work. Even so, there are some good stories in this book, particularly 'The Bicentennial Man,' which manages to have scope and sustain a gentle, forlorn quality throughout."
5,"True to Life,and hysterically funny.","Sheri Lynch paints a clear picture here.Life is disfunctional and we have to swim around it!Her antics will make not only you roar with laughter,but those who get subjected to,""listen to this"".Nothing is sugar coated in her quest to be like the Cleavers and you gotta love her for that.She puts it out there,puke and all.I very much enjoyed the laughs I got from this book!"
2,Funny but a little tedious,"I found the author's views hilarious but her mad-cap versions of everyday life and her (assumed) exagerations of her trials as a working mother and wife got a little tedious after a while. I thought it was funny, but I got to the point where I had to either close the book or put out a 9-1-1 call to ""Supernanny"". I chose the former. Sorry. I just couldn't get over the urge to jump in the book to help her or call her to make sure she wasn't in an asylum. If you want hoots and giggles, this is the book for you. If it wasn't for the author's humor, I would probably have been really pissed off about the money I spent on the book."
4,book review,"Good book (every parent should read), great condition for used book. Very effecient in deleviery."
5,Great Book - great service,"Recieved product in a timely matter. Just what I was looking for. Appreicated being notified that product was available, because I had ordered similar merchandise."
2,Good Idea; Bad Execution,"Sheri is great on the radio show she co-hosts however her humor did not work so well in this book of random thoughts and statements. The idea for the book, transforming and organizing her family, is good but I found the book to be way too scattered to be considered a good read."
4,Love Sheri,I love Sheri on the radio and the book was in the same style. Very enjoyable. Wish she would write another book about the new chapters in her life.
3,Mindy,"I gave this book as a gift. It is not my cup of tea, but the person I gave it to liked it very much."
4,It's ok.,"I love the ""Bob and Sheri Show"", that's why I thought I would love this book by Sheri Lynch. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Yes, some places had me really laughing, but not the whole thing."
5,Fast and Funny Read,"This is a great read for anyone who has raised, is raising, or in the process of raising children. In pursuing her demented attempt at recreating a sitcom, Sheri touches on moments that everyone who has ever been part of a family can relate to. It is a fast, fun and extremely entertaining book."
5,Such a funny book to bad it did not have more pages!!!,"I bought it... I read it in day and half, kept me laughing, husband laughing, daughter laughing...is for the whole family,keep the good work sheri, I can't wait to read the third one.Xochitl Jordan"
3,I love Tamiya kits...but..,"I'm an adult model hobbyist, and I think Tamiya makes the finest kits, but this one is a little too intricate for me. I think this one must be an older kit. The mold details are a little less perfect than others I've built. The P-51 Mustang, for instance, is much better."
4,Bought this for my new grandson...,He has enjoyed it and the music helps him sleep. It has also helped his eye hand coordination.
4,"Good, Durable product","Very well made, resistant product. Soothing music and the lighting stars add a nice sleeping environment for the baby. recomended 100%"
1,Battery Eater,"My mom bouth this toy for my son. The music portion of the mobile is fine. Plays classical & lullaby music. At night you can see the stars on top of the ceiling which we loved. However, the mobile moves so slow that you have to look closly to see if it is actually moving. And the whole unit eats batteries like crazy. I only used to about two months and had to change the batteries about 6 times. Even with fresh batteries sometimes the music won't play, or the light for the stars wouldn't come on. I highly suggest not buying this product. In fact, the next time I'm in a city that has toy-r-us, i will be returning it."
3,noisey,"I would like to ask others who have purchased this mobile if they hear a ""buzzing"" sound as the mobile rotates. It seems loud to me and I'm wondering if this is normal or if I purchased a defective one.Also, I feel the music is too loud even at the lower volume selection. I even covered the speaker to muffle it as it's primary purpose is to put the baby to sleep not keep him/her awake."
4,Fisher Price Miracles and Milestones,"I have always loved Fisher Price items so when I looked for a mobile, they were the first ones I looked at. I have been pleased overall with the mobile. Amazon was great at shipping fast and ordering was very easy. Overall, I have been very pleased and will order from Amazon again."
1,"nice cookbook, but nothing new.","I had bought this book as I had the authors other book, Blue Plate special. But be warned, this is the same book only in a different wrapper. I could find no difference, and if anything was added, I couldn't find it. So get one or the other, you won't need both.Kudo's to Amazon for a great return policy."
3,Different type of cookbook,"The cookbook has a lot of interesting photos and ""fun facts"" about past diners; but the recipies are not that great. Its pretty basic and the taste is blan. I found better recipies on websites then in this book."
3,"Not great, but not bad","I am a big fan of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Channel and was hoping for a cookbook that would give me some cool, ""different"" recipes. This one is in the neighborhood, but doesn't quite do it all the way. The search goes on!"
2,Nothing special,"As far as driving games go, Test Drive offers nothing particularly compelling. It sets itself apart from other driving games in that it attempts to wrap a story around the races. Seeing where this story goes makes for interesting gameplay, but that's about it.The driving itself is pretty fun, with courses ranging from twisting urban environment to rurual settings where you can really open it up. You have a variety of cars at your fingertips, ranging from classic muscle cars to modern Italian supercars.The biggest downside to the game is that there is no damage model whatsoever. If you get into a head on at full speed you'll see some impressive physics as the other car goes flying, but no cars sustain any damage. All you loose is time.Test Drive is worth a rent, but there are better driving games out there for the XBox (such as Burnout and Project Gotham)."
1,Not realistic,"The worst thing I hated about this game is that it didn't matter how well you did, you could never gain a lead on the others. You could pass a car that was facing the other direction and in two seconds that car would be passing you. So basically it doesn't matter how good you are, it matters how lucky you are. Get rid of the computer assistance."
2,Board,"I bought this game because I like muscle cars a lot. The game has some strong points like drag racing is cool exept that it gets boaring after a wile. Underground racing is not bad. The graphics are not the best, XBox could have dont better. The one big problem with this game is that it gets boaring after you play it for a wile."
5,A good racing game for all,"This game is a must have. The graphics are good and you can customize your own car and it is a blast. alos the street racing is cool becaus it is like the movie "" THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS "" which is a good movie too. Also the soundtrack is good becase it is just like in the movie. So get this game i rented it but i like itso trust if you rent i you wil like it"
4,Better than Project Gotham,"I'm a huge fan of games like this. You go flying through a crowded city at 150 and on the verge of flying out of control. Think of it as Fast and the Furious in game form. It's got a decent story line, is able to play your own music, decent graphics, and good controls. The biggest bonus is the variety of cars. Everything from a Plymouth Barracuda Hemi to a Dodge Viper to a Dodge Charger. They're all here. I'm very satisfied with this game. The only bad thing is that there's too much light in my family room to be able to play night races during the day."
1,If you value your money skip this game!,"This game was just pure [junk]! Touchy controls, no sense of winning, everything is the same over and over, you can lose or win in a matter of seconds, boring interface and the list can keep going on. I would give it no stars if I was allowed! If you want a good racer pick up ""Project Gotham Racing"". Much better feel of control overall, better cars, better design, it's just a better game. To make this quick, if you value fifty bucks don't waste it on ""Test Drive"" it really is that bad!"
2,This sucks,"This game [isn't good],don't waste your money on this.I found it to have bad graphics and it just wasn't fun.I rented it and I became so bored with it that i took it back 3 days early.If you're interested in a good racing game,get either Sega GT 2002 or Project Gotham Racing."
1,game is worth more as a frisbee.,"When i bought this game i thought it would be like gotham racing but with more of a variety, but i was wrong, it has less variety. No damage on the cars and the lighting sucks. Almost every level i have been to(which is as far as the 4th level on underground mode because i just gave up cause it was to damn long and hard.) is in the night which is anouying. Also you cant get a lead on the computer they are always right there. The cops are also anouying especailly when they pull you over right near the end of the level. Also the computer can knock you into oblivion but you cant even knock them off course, and characters are anouying, they say the same thing every time. This game isnt even worth renting and definantly do not! i repeat, do not buy test drive! Its an exspensive frisbee. In fact i am turning it into funco land."
4,Great Game!,This a great game because of the graphics and the new Underground mode. The problem with the game is that after playing a couple races in a city it gets very boring. The reason for this is the tracks are all very similar except for the direction you are driving the track in.
3,Awsome simulation,"This is one of the best games ever, the only real problem is the one of music and the poor graphics. If we talk abot simulation though we can find one of the best games in the whole world. this game is realy worth buying. It is a must!"
4,A Great Nelons DVD,"This DVD is part 1 of the Promised Reunion Concert from the Nelons. This is only about 40 min long. It has all the Nelons from over the years, including Jannet Pascal, Karen Peck, Ronnie, etc. The source material sound very much like a mid 90s recording. The music itself and the Nelons are excelent performances and thus this is still highly recommended by me."
2,My Kitties Of Mass Destruction,"Hmmmm... this book was a little too warm and fuzzy for me, and my cats still don't do what I want them to do. I like to call them my kitties of mass destruction.I know the above statement doesn't really offer any constructive criticism so let me see if I can put into words what I didn't like about this book. Warren and Fay seem to be very caring and compassionate animal lovers but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of practical advice regarding getting cats to do what you want.There were however, lots of cute stories about their animals sprinkled with a bit of advice - most of which I'd already heard. It was a nice read if you like animals (which I do) but not much help in the whole ""getting them to do what you want"" area."
2,Not Practical,"I found the book fairly entertaining to read, and was preparing for adopting a cat myself. However, once reality set in (i.e., I had a cat living in my house with me), I determined that many of the assumptions he makes about cats and their ability to adapt and respond to human behavior are, at best, only applicable to SOME cats, and, at worst, not really true at all. Life with cats can be great, but encouraging people to expect them to behave in a more responsive way (like a dog, I guess) is setting people- like me - up for a big disappointment."
2,TOO cute... and I mean that literally,"I had a hard time getting past the author's mania for adorable little furballs. Here's an example: ""Are your well-deserved vacations spoiled because you just can't cope with the anxiety of leaving behind the little furball?"". Those of you who answer yes will probably enjoy reading the book from cover to cover. Everyone else will do better looking up topics of interest, or reading a different book altogether. Having said that, there is some good information here, and an important message that you will be a better cat owner if you try to understand the cat's perspective. I suggest reading the Publishers Weekly review quoted by Amazon, because that nails it."
1,Too complicated...,"Simply put...this program was way too complicated to understand. I just gave up on it. Gave it away to a thrift store and bought the regular new version of artist's manniquin by Art S. Buck. The manniquin is much cheaper than this computer program by far. No fuss, no muss for the real thing. This program needs to be reworked for simple minds to understand. I can work Photoshop better than this thing."
3,"Ok, if you don't know anything about Andersonvill Prison","I found this book in my high school's library, and read it because1. It's an Accelerated Reader, and2. I'm interested in Andersonville Prison and the Civil War.I finished the book, because I needed the Accelerated Reader points, but I was disappointed. The book told me nothing I didn't already know, and did it while defining simple terms.The book would have been OK if I had never even heard of Andersonville Prison. I did appreciate all of the quotes from witnesses and such, but the book itself was too watered-down for my taste.I recommend this book to people totally new to Andersonville Prison, because it gives one a broad base from which to launch one's self."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this product!","I have owned TWO of these toasters. In the first one, a plastic part broke off a supposedly ""all metal"" toaster. With reluctance, Hamilton Beach provided a replacement. Now that one doesn't work! This has all taken place since July 2007! I have a Russell Hobbs toaster that has been a workhorse for years...we moved it to our summer home because a four slot toaster made more sense there. I fully intend to replace this piece of H B junk with another Russell Hobbs."
3,Not for beginners,"I have both volumes by this author to try and expand my knowledge of numerology. I'm familiar with the esoteric numerology which I have been using on and off for decades. Unfortunately, the author has failed to give an explanation of what modified numbers are. Not a good book for beginners. Took me some time to realize that modified numbers come from a change in name. Somewhat frustrating."
5,best by far,The best book on numerology by far.You will need volume 1 and 2 to put it together. This should not be your first book as it is so good and technical that you should have some knowledge prior to commencement.Just great.
5,Gerat book,My daughter lived it. I don't how much she will continue her read thought but so far she's excited to get the book.
1,Recipes and Wooden Spoons,This book was in great shape when it arrived. I am glad it was because it was a gift for a friend.
1,Wastes Gas No Control,I bought this to replace an 5 yr old model by the same company thinking it would have an improved flame and work better at angles. I wrongly assumed it would have the same settings control. I will return and look for a model that has setting controls. I use that for many purposes.
2,Served me well but could be better,Spend the extra money and get the upgraded model with an adjustable flame. It is very useful to have that adjustment capability. Also that model seems built better.
3,Lasted only a few years.,"I have one for around three or four years, I like tools the feel solid in your hands. Recently the valve began to leak, that is when you take your finger off the trigger a 1/2 inch flame remains.Unfortunately Bernzomatic does not sell replacement parts, something I hold highly has a sign of a good quality tool"
2,Didn't last long,"The igniter worked for about 10 separate lightings, then got very difficult to light, then stopped altogether. Tried cleaning the igniter tip but no improvement. Seems like there's no way to light the torch using a standard striker, so the torch is basically useless now. And seems to be no easy way to repair or replace any parts. Into the trash it goes.Will look instead for a more reliable and serviceable torch.Some of these reviews sound like they were written by bernzomatic..."
4,very pleased,"I ordered this for my husband who had something like this, but wasn't working...When he got it,and saw how quickly it worked--he ran to our neighbors to show it off!"
3,Wish the filter would last a little longer...,The filter works well but only for a couple of weeks. You must replace frequently.
4,Works fine,I can't say a whole lot about this product. It is the filter that goes with the pool we purchased this summer. We have really enjoyed the pool. The filter seems to work good.
5,It's a filter,"It filters dirty water, and it fits in the pump. Not much to say other than, ""It works."" It was easy to install and the single filter works well for someone who doesn't have a lot of use because they're using the filter and pump to cycle water in an inflatable kids pool for a toddler."
2,No Multiplayer Support,"The MacOS X port of this game is done pretty well. However, Civilization 3 is a lot like its predecessors in terms of gameplay. The main changes being improved user interface, graphics, and no multiplayer support. I subtracted 3 stars for going backwards."
4,An overall great game.,"I recently purchased Civ III for my Mac and was quite content even after reading some of the nasty reviews about it. Many people say that not much has changed, but honestly people, what were you expecting? If you wanted a completely changed game, why did you buy a Sid Meier game? It's the same basic format, just with more eye candy, and more realistic, which is all I really wanted. They've also got patches and maps and even an expansion coming out to boot! My only complaint is that it does react a little slowly, but that's a price I'm willing to pay. I'd urge you to buy this game if you liked the other civ games."
3,Mac version has no editor,"The ad says it comes with an editor for the maps and etc. This is not true, unless you have a PC. They have been promising this for a long time, and I am beginning to get tired of playing this game and still no editor. This is unacceptable support from the publishers.It is a good game. I have played it a lot in the last six months, but the delay on the editor is now becoming a real sore point. I would give it 5 stars otherwise. It plays well, and with plenty of speed on my flat-screen iMac, by the way. This will be a great game when the publishers live up to their advertising and supply the editors. It is just wrong to advertise this product as coming with an editor. Shame on you for deceptive advertising!"
1,oh boy,I had to send the set back due to very bad picture quality. The picture would even roll at times.
4,A good supplement to Specters of Marx,"For those of us initially frustrated by Derrida's refusal, in Specters of Marx, to engage seriously with Marx and/or with politics, this book will not alleviate the problem. In fact, it exacerbates the frustration, but it does so in a way that may help to clarify the debate around the book. A decent selection of views and reviews on Specters of Marx (but missing the crucial review by Gayatri Spivak) is followed by Derrida's astonishingly petulant reply. Choosing sides becomes easier, even for the avowed deconstructionist, when Derrida's own pettiness makes it clear that (just as with Marxism) it is clearly possible to partake of a ""Derrideanism without Derrida,"" and in so doing subtract the insularity of the man from the suggestiveness of the work. We readers will have to carry deconstructive Marxism farther than Derrida. But this supplement is always the condition of reading."
5,perfect replacement,"This product was a perfect replacement for the electrical stowe cable cover on my fifth wheel trailer. I originally went to a camper retail outlet, but they did not have the correct cover, and the price was much higher than this product. Excellent seller with fast shipping."
3,Strong on protein...weak on taste,"This is the second flavor of optimum 100% whey that I have tried. I must say that the cookies and cream flavor was much better tasting.The vanilla ice cream really doesn't have much flavor at all. When mixed with milk, it tastes like a slightly vanilla-y milk shake. But if you mix it at the gym, with water, it just tastes disgusting.So overall, optimum makes very good, quality protein. In terms of nutritional value, ON is awesome. I'd just recommend another flavor."
4,camp pad,I had no problem getting the pad rolled up and back in it's bag.I like the thickness it should be quite comfortable to lay onIt is a heavier material so should not puncture to quickly
3,"It May Be Us, But Hard to Deflate","Good concept and seems comfortable. Comes fairly compact, but still has some size and weight you should consider. Never could deflate it to its original state. A family member is on a camping trip as I am writing this review. He brought his inflatable mattress instead which has a battery operated pump."
1,not as advertised,Mattress does not blow up to 3 inches thick. Maybe a 1/2 inch thick. Not even close to what it advertised.
4,Great price,"This is an early Christmas gift for my daughter but I'm sure she'll love it since she's a big fan of Dora and she's played with her cousin's Doodle Pro and really had fun with it. She may be a little young for it, 2, but I couldn't pass it up because of the very low price and free shipping."
5,Great for Toddlers,"This is a great product for any youngster young enough to start wanting to color or draw but pleases both parties because there is no mess of crayons or pencil marks on everything but the paper you gave them. It has a button that talks and says about three phrases, not a big deal but cool for the kids, and a couple of tracing sheets. I love it because like I already mentioned, I tried the crayons and wonder crayolas, but this leaves no mess and is impossible to chew or swallow marker pieces and won't break. Hope you enjoy!!"
5,Best occupier!!,"My lil 7 month old loves TUBBIES! She could do without the human sections, but I will plan to buy more videos if it give me 15-20 min of clean up time. It was fast delivery and great conidition of the DVD."
2,"Fulfills a need, but needs better proof reading","There is a definite need for a book like this. However, some more careful pre-publishing review would have helped. For example, the permeability of free space is given wrong, consistently, by a factor of 10^20. The formulas for Coulomb's law, and the Biot-Savart law, have the wrong exponent of ""r"" in the denominator. The formula for inductance of a solenoid implies a dependence of inductance on current, although if the student has the patient to track down the definition of symbols the answer is correct, if expressed in a curious way. All in all, there is a great need for a book like this, but a reference work has to be as far as possible 100% trustworthy and reliable. A second, corrected, version of this book would be invaluable."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"Fine product. It works - allows you to use the torch at any angle without it extinguishing. Installation was a snap. The price is decent too. It is a little tall, and what I received doesn't exactly match the photo shown (the styling is different), but, it works so I am happy."
3,It works when it wants to,Sometimes you can hit the button once and it works instantly and other times you have to sit there hitting it over and over again before it will ignite the propane. your luck may be different though.....
4,The Gin Blossoms Are Awesome!,"The Gin Blossoms are back in action and together again. Now we have a live concert DVD to show us all just how great this band is in concert. They perform their songs flawlessly. We are also given 8 music videos (with different versions of a few) as bonus features. As I said, the performance on this DVD is perfect and flawless. The error of this DVD falls in the editing. The person who did the editing was a little too obsessed with switching from shot to shot, which can kind of become annoying at times, but you get used to it. My only other complaint is that they didn't play ""Follow You Down"" or ""Found Out About You"". If you're a true Gin Blossoms fan, you MUST buy this DVD! You won't regret it."
3,To clear something up.,"As a note, although this is marked as ""season 2,"" in the way the series is actually presented here and on hulu ""season 2"" is actually the second half of season 1. Up to episode 51 is ""season one"" in Japan, to avoid some confusion. (And by episode, I mean a 23 minute block). The second half of season 1 (season two) is available on hulu, but it is subtitled."
5,Enter into the peace of the Lord,"These worship songs are so wonderful and have become favorites, along with Haven, another Living Waters album. They bring me right into fellowship with the Lord and into the peace and joy that are found in His presence. I am so thankful to have found them!"
5,Awesome CD,"Awesome CD! The first time I heard it, I was moved instantly into worship. Some of the songs are familiar, some are not, but all are so anointed. One that I had never heard, (Jesus) You Are Beautiful, is especially moving. I have put it on repeat, and just spent all day telling Him how much I appreciate what He has done for me."
2,Slower than my old 386...,"I like the game, it's definately not as good as GT3 or Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero, but it's kind of addictive. The biggest problem I had was the loading time!! It takes about 3 minutes to load a level. They do give you a game of Pong to play while you wait, but that gets boring quickly. If you want to restart the level, you must wait another 2 or 3 minutes and then you have to wait after the race too!!! I think they could have made it a little faster, I know the PS2 can handle graphics decently fast. The graphics aren't really all that good, and the levels seem to repeat. Eventually you race the same track over and over at each area of the world. ..."
2,One word for Test Drive,"I have one word to discribe this game and it is.....[bad]. This game is very unrealistic, there are to many things to name, and not enough room to type it all. The ingenious thing about this game is that you can play pong while the game is loading, but that's just about the best thing."
3,Fun but not worth 50 bucks.,"This game is fun, but certainly not worth 50 bucks. i just rented it today. It was fun for about 3 hours than just real boring, it has a lot of repitition. You basically do the same thing over and over just in different locations. It is certainly worht the 6 bucks to rent it. The cars have really good graphics and so do the levels. The only problem is the level appears about 20 feet infront of your car, not a lot of time to move out of the way. And the ""traffic"" you can't see till you hit. Incase you saw the commercial, the cops don't pull you over like in need for speed, they just hit you to slow you down, thats it. If you stop for about 3 seconds with one, you get a ticket, which just makes you sit there for another 2 or 3 seconds. And there is no car damage."
2,very annoying very not good,"this game reeks, just when you thought a racing game couldnt get any more annoying this game surprises you. The loading times are so long theres a game to play while u wait. Even if u botch a race and its already loaded in the memory it still needs to reload. Dont worry youll botch races. 99% of the time it wont be your fault though. The other cars are annoying and unfair, the tracks @ night are impossible to navigate, and the controls arent the greatest. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this game"
3,A decent game,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Test Drive is a decent game, but put up against Gran Turismo 3 or Burnout it just doesnt get the job done. What really gets me is they advertise the game has such spectacular wrecks and they are so unrealistic and blah. When you reck into another car, even if you're going like 80, your car will just slam into the other car and bounce off, with not a scratch on it. No explosions or shattered glass, nothing. Its just kind of anti climactic. Anyway, not a bad game, just not as good over all as the previous games I mentioned."
3,"Fun at first , but then...",When I started playing the game I liked it. I messed with the cars and the car colors. I like the cool cars but I hate it when you are racing and other cars cut out in front of you and make you crash. Or when they create a pile-up of 3 or 4 cars.
1,good cars but to fake,"This game has some very cool cars, but is horrible when it comes to realism. I personaly dont think it is much fun when you can run over light poles and they fall over like twigs. And another thing is that when you r just about to win a race it always seems like the time runs out. That really makes me mad. I rented it but i would never buy this game. And 1 more thing is that it seems impossible to run over anybody.To me this game really stinks."
2,Not Worth It,This game has good graphics but is very repetitive. All the cars are basically the same speed and it took me only 2 weeks to beat. It is very frustrating when you are winning and then smash into a car and then lose. The other cars catch up very quickly when you crash and winning the money doesn't do anything to help.
2,Not quite what I expected,"An absolute atrosity. Not as many cars as Gran Turismo, the game play has an ""arcady"" feel which makes it completely unrealistic, and the graphics aren't as nice as I would have hoped."
3,Average game,"I bought this game today, and I was a little bit disappointed. I am a big fan of BURNOUT! and this game is not nearly as fast or fun as that one is. When you wreck (and you will) you just bounce all around and land facing the wrong way! It can be tough to make some of the sharp turns, too.....This game is more similar to Ridge Racer V, but be prepared to hit A LOT OF STUFF, and to flip around like crazy!!!!!There is a story mode, too, which I thought was really stupid and cheesy. I am hoping that the two player mode will be a lot of fun and will make my purchase more worthwhile......Hopefully other people will enjoy this one more than I did......."
1,GTA's the ONLY car game the PS2 needs.,"Bad music, awful handeling, ect. I played Test Drive at my friend's house, and he said it was ""a million times better than Grand Theft Auto 3."" Devin lied. Here's the comparisens:Grand Theft Auto 3:You can get out of the car and steal other ones.Test Drive:Your stuck in one car the whole time.GTA3:No time limit.TD:Time limit.GTA3:You can run over people.TD:The people always jump out of the way, which gets annoying.GTA3:Radio stations.TD:One [terrible] RAP song playing the whole time.GTA3:Uzis, bazookas, pistols, flamethrowers, grenades,...TD:...car.GTA3:Awesome control.TD:Horrid control.GTA3:Get it.TD:Don't."
2,All right but not worth the $20 I got it for.,"Its all right. I mean, they only really have one half decent game mode. Its something called Cop Chase. You're the cop and you need to track down the five bad guys. To ""arrest"" them you ram them until the bar above the car is empty. Also, while the game is loading, you play pong. You know that first video game that our parents played when they were kids. All in all, if I were looking at it debating to buy it or not, I would put it back on the shelf."
5,whats the point of a title? im obviosly reviewing this game,"it sure as hell DOESNT feel as ur really in the car. the cars accelerate too fast and turn too easily - might be a good thing for some but if u want a realistic racing game, get gt3. i personally like both realistic and unrealistic racing games. its a fun game and it looks quite nice."
2,Too many straps,"This vest completely covers my 90+ lb Chesapeake Bay, but the third strap would be over his genitals. So I clip the final third strap under the vest but not around his body. It's cheap, so I'm not sending it back...and he's very old and is probably the last of his size at our home to wear this. My pitbull has a vest from another manufacturer, and one strap goes around the neck and the second final strap is around the torso...just two velcro straps in all. So the 3 strap configuration in this purchase is truly an overkill in design for dogs...like the designer didn't understand or study general dog anatomy before creating this."
2,wish it had been an actual XL-too small for my lab,"it was not what I wanted and returned it. it was too small and a pain to get on and off. I did order another one that is awesome and fits my black lab, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00714OF8G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_6hope this helps. with dogs, clothes have to be easy on and easy off. easy return, nice seller."
1,"girth, weight,and collars size not given","read # 2. ""title for your review"". it does not give the sizes be it smaall, med., lg., or xlg. sizes for the vest. read kvpets and how they describe the sizes. 18004238211. page 116 of their christmas cat."
1,badly cropped,"I wanted a print of ""The School of Athens,"" and when I saw the incredibly low price of this one I immediately ordered it without looking at it carefully. It is terribly cropped. At the bottom right, one only gets the head of a figure whom one should see demonstrating something on the floor with compasses. Only the head and shoulders of Heraclitus and Pythagoras are visible. Toward the top, Apollo and Athena are beheaded by the cropping. This print is not worth the penny it cost."
5,Thick and Sticky,"Actually takes about 3 days to really cure in my cold basement shop, but is very thick and sticky. Cures rock hard. Not for 'poly' plastics as expected, but great for about everything else! Have not tried underwater. Note: the PC7 version is even stickier. Have ample paper napkins & popsicle stick handy for use during working time. It can be a bit messy."
5,SUPERB,"THIS CD IS SO AMAZING, I BROUGHT IT FOR MY CHILDREN WHO ARE, 5 AND 10 AND I HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPING TO IT MYSELF, THESE CHILDREN ARE TRULY GIFTED AND I PRAISE GOD FOR THERE WONDERFUL TALENTS, PLEASE BUY THIS CD. IT'S TRULY WORTH EVERY PENNY"
5,Deftly detonated explosive plots distinguish thriller.,"Dynamite!!! Dr.Samlaska is a master detonator of explosive plots and subplots. Superb handling of technical and medical details make this book appealing to a variety of readers. The characters are so real, they walk off the page to greet you! Until the sequel,I'll just have to read Eucarion again. Susan Neely RPh."
5,"Outstanding, Seat Grabber, Do Not Put It Down book!","Not being in the medical profession, I was a bit leary of this book, However, after picking it up and starting it, I could not put it down until finished. It seems every chapter has something different going on all over the globe. One dosen't figure out the ending until the last chapter. It is definately an OUTSTANDING read."
1,Rio Forge is junk,"Got one of these for Christmas, and it worked fine until the battery went dead in it. When I replaced the battery it kept telling me it needed to be reformatted. I followed the advice on the website and nothing worked. I called tech support and they walked me through it, but it still would not work. Then they told me the memory was corrupted (and from what they said it was a common problem) and had to be replaced. But since my wife had bought it well in advance of Christmas it was past the 90 day warranty. That's right only 90 factory warranty. Seems they acknowledge these things are only good for a month or so then give out on you sometime within the first 6 months or less. They offered to sell me a new one for around $20 dollars more than you can buy one on through this or any other website.No wonder there are so many refurbished models for sell...."
1,"Returned it, too.....",This player completely froze loading music. After that it wouldn't even power on. Rio technical service advised a hard reboot. Same thing happened again. Rio technical service advised returning the Forge. So I did. Shopping around now.
1,Don't buy it,"I've read the same on some other message boards - the thing simply stops working. I probably only used it 3-4 times, then it started cutting off even when I would hit a button other than the power button. It would restart, but would act up in some similar fashion right away. It would cut off with just the tiniest tap. Then when I restarted it (the last time it would respond at all), it gave me some lack of memory message. It only had 10 songs on it... I also was not a fan of the armband. Seems like they put the velcro tab on the wrong side. Perhaps I just couldn't figure it out, but at the very least it's counterintuitive. Stay away...I sent an email 3 days ago to the internet help line, which promised 24 hour response, but no response so far."
1,Do not buy this product,"This is my second Rio Player and both have been useless within a year of very mild use. When a Rio player breaks outside of the 90-day warrentee period, there is no support and no replacement.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I got the Rio Forge for christmas and had problems right away. It keeps shuting off. I had a horrible time getting through to customer support and when I did the tech said, "" I hope the person who bought it for you kept the reciept"". Then we got disconnected and I couldn't get through again. This machine is not worth it. It's a big headache."
2,"Great features, but unreliable","I really like a lot about the Forge: expandable memory, stopwatch, small size, nice design, user friendly software, FM stereo with record capability, and on and on. Unfortunately, the darn thing keeps shutting off when you push the buttons, and it's not because the battery is low, unless the battery meter is wrong. So, I really can't recommend the Rio Forge. I wish I'd bought something else."
1,another dead one,"No kidding, no making stuff up, these things have a high failure rate. In spite of the warnings in the other reviews I bought one of these a couple of months ago. It just died. Luckily, it is still under warranty but now I'm without a player while it's being repaired/replaced and I have no faith that it won't die again. I'm very disappointed in this product. It worked well when it worked but that's little consolation after it dies."
1,The Rio Forge isn't worth it,"I purchased this a few months ago and it's already broken. I can't adjust the volume at all, the different parts keep seperating and I had to buy new head phones. It doesn't fit into the arm band very well and can fall out while I'm riding my bike. I really don't recommend this one to anyone. If you really want an MP3 player, spend the extra money and get a name brand that can be trusted. It was a mistake for me to think that this would work."
1,Avoid the Rio Forge,"After a month the problems started with my Rio player. First the volume couldn't be turned down, then the songs couldn't be advanced. I patiently contacted online support and had to wait a week for a response. Each time the response wasn't complete. It told me to download something but didn't say from where. They told me to send info (including credit card #, which I didn't) and then told me my phone # was missing (which it wasn't). I re-sent the info and heard nothing for 2 1/2 weeks. After following up they told me to fax in my original receipt but didn't give a fax #. Their site has a tab for phone and fax contact info but doesn't include a fax number.Buy an iPod. You'll save yourself a lot of aggravation and time."
1,It makes me want to curse.,"It's silver, it's sexy, and the sound quality is AMAZING. When it works. That's all this player has going for it.I was hesitant, based on all the reviews. I bought one anyway and enjoyed it for almost a month. Did a couple of downloads, yada yada yada. One day after attempting to record something from the radio, the internal memory assumed some unknown format. I could not find any instructions anywhere on how to re-format the device. Formatting issues caused by a feature of the device raised a big red flag, so I decided to return it to the store (thankfully I still had a couple days left before the 30-day period).Unfortunately, I returned it for another Forge. This time, the player crashed after a few hours of use.I'm done with the Forge. I am exchanging this piece of crap for the iRiver 512MB player.I would give this zero stars if that was possible."
1,AWESOME.... then it crashes and NO LONGER WORKS!,"Folks,These reviews you are reading ARE CREDIBLE... I prayed they weren't after I'd already purchased...The story - Bought in November... PHENOMENAL!... I loved this thing, durable, crystal clear sound, never skipped... About mid December it began randomly shutting off. I thought bad battery... turns out BAD PRODUCT. This eventually became the norm - random shut offs in the middle of runs.. and for a 220lb guy trying to get back in shape, shutting off during runs is HELL! Eventually it died. Best Buy has agreed to accept the return (minus reciept) for store credit.HELL YES - I'm taking that deal and getting an Iriver (see Consumerreports.org review)"
1,Don't buy it ...No matter what,"I bought 1 Rio at Best Buy, and had it about a week. I liked the armband, for working out. I went to buy one for my husband, and when Best Buy did not have any in stock, I bought one online. The day my husband's arrived, my died. I was able to return it to Best Buy, since I had it less than 30 days. 3 days later, my husband's died, and I am having a heck of a time trying to get dealtrain (the company I purchased from through Amazon)or Rio to refund my money. Stay away from this product!!!"
1,"bad product, bad support","heed the advice of others on here. this is a defective product with extremely poor customer support, waiting weeks for responses. my player died two weeks after i got it. buy something else, the aggravation isn't worth it. and rio obviously is not concerned about customer support after the sale."
1,Defective product,"I bought this player as a gift for my husband for xmas. After 1 week of use, the darn thing won't even power up. No lights, no display, no nothing!!! It seems that other reviewers of this product have had the same problem too. Looks like this is a known problem, see Document 5823 under support options at http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/rioaudio/ Unfortunately because I did my xmas shopping too early I cannot return this product because the last refund date has already passed. Going to try my hand with the warranty...and looks like it's only a 90 day warranty at that...which is almost passed as well. I don't recommend this purchase at all. It's a waste of money."
2,Flash memory doesn't work,"Great player for mp3s, but the FM tuner is worthless because you can't get any stations and the sound quality is poor.I also trashed 2 512mb sd cards trying to upgrade the memory.Called Rio support last June and told them. They said they would get back to me, and that there was a problem with memory cards and this unit. Still have not gotten back to me and it is January 2005 as of this writing.Don't buy this unit unless you are looking for an MP3 flash player ONLY and are willing to accept the limited memory that ships with the unit. You can't expect sd cards to work.I like the ease of use and the advantages of flash memory, also the arm band, which allows me to run with it and not have to worry about damaging a hard drive."
1,Buy an Apple...,My Forge 256 crashed when adding an expansion card. Can't even turn it on anymore. Nothing the help line suggests works and they've made no move to accept responsibility. I'm furious with Rio and will never buy their product again.
2,Rio has it's ups and downs!,"I really liked my Rio Forge! It really kept me moving in the gym.But the radio sucks! I could never get a station to stay in tune.The other problem is that the battery door never stayed on tight. Sure enough the day I did not keep checking on it was the day I lost the battery door cover. I went to the web site looking to order a replacement door, and they do mot carry replacenent doors. Why have something on the market that can not be replaced. So now I am using duct tape to keep the battery in. That really is tacky!The company first told me that it was on back order, So I waited and waited. For two months. Now that the warrenty is expired, they now tell me that there will never be replacement doors available."
1,Broken in 4 months,"I bought the Rio Forge 256 Sport as a Christmas present for my 13-year-old daughter. I liked the fact that it used flash memory with no moving parts to break. It is also expandable with an SD card, but I never tried it. I paid $135 from Amazon at the time.She used it happily for four months. It only ""crashed"" once with a weird memory error that wasn't obvious to reformat, but I figured it out somehow.Last night she told me it was broken; the VOLUME DOWN button wouldn't work. UP worked fine, but she couldn't turn the volume DOWN. I knew the unit was out of the 90-day warranty so I opened it. I found the volume-down switch separating from the circuit board. Rio wants $99 to replace it, so I'm going to try my best to fix it. Either way, I'll never buy another Rio product.I gave the unit one star since the cost of ownership in my experience is about $30/month."
4,Not bad,"I bought this player as refurbished for 80.00 with a 20.00 rebate and after reading the reviews I hedged my bet and bought the extended warranty. All I really wanted was a MP3 player to take with me while I was running and so far so good. I updated the player as soon as I recieved it on the recommendation of other reviews, FM radio reception is good enough for my uses (running and working in the yard) and the player has worked just fine, I have even dropped it and crashed it into the door once (accident) still no problems...stays on no random shutting off...if I start having problems I'll update my review but for 60.00 so far can't beat it!"
2,Okay purchase if no memory card added,"I bought the Rio Forge specifically for the gym and because of its FM Tuner. My gym has television sets up with an FM tuner so you can hear the audio side. However, the tuner has NEVER worked at the gym and I can only get one regular radio station to work inside the building.Also after adding a 512MB memory card to the RIO, I have had non-stop problems with the RIO shutting off at the start-up. Rio's customer service has been quick in responding to my emails, but their suggestions haven't worked. It seems like I need to reformat my RIO every week, and also need to change batteries every week to ""trick"" the RIO into working.The RIO did work fine before the memory card was added, but if it is going to be advertised with an expandable memory slot, it should work when used.It's been a lot of hassle since I bought it, and I'm regretting my choice of MP3 players. I would stay away from this product until something more stable comes out."
2,Good while it worked..,"Like another Rio I owned, this thing broke down within two weeks. The sound and design are pretty impressive and the unit is quite stylish and comfortable to hold and operate while running. I don't use the FM tuner so the apparent inadequacies in that department don't matter to me. However, after I left the Rio in my car overnight during a sub-zero spell here in Chicago, the thing will no longer turn on. Thankfully this happened while I can still return the stupid thing. Do not buy Rios! When I had my 128mp unit I did try calling customer service and after getting the complete runaround and no help I threw the unit away."
5,If music be the soul of love play on,"An excellent collection of quotations organized into a too long list of categories. The main headings are 'Definitions and Descriptions' ' Forms and Styles' 'Creation' ' Lives and Works'Some samples""Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without"" Confucius""Mozart is sunshine."" Antonin Dvorak"" I shall hear in heaven."" Beethoven""When it sounds good, it is good"" Duke Ellington"
2,No R-Value listed in description,"Would have purchased this, but I needed a specific R-Value to meet code here in NC... Guess I'll look elsewhere."
5,"a really ""doable"" tape","OK, so I'm the kind of person that buys every new fitness book, tape, magazine etc, and then get bored of it after a week.This tape is not so long, so you don't spend half your session waiting for it to end. Her instructions are clear, the moves are easy to modify, you don't need any equipment-it's wonderful!!!!!!"
5,You WILL feel it!,"Kathy Smith's Lower Body Workout is one of the most awesome tapes I've ever done. You will be sore, but that's good! Because you know it's working!Kathy is a spectacular instructor, she doesn't talk your head off, but she gives you good mental visuals to help make your workout efficient (""Like you're sitting down in a chair"" or ""Reach up like you're getting a glass out of the cabinet""). She also includes two levels of each step she does! She has four people behind her, two of which are doing an easier version of the movement and two which are doing the advanced version. And they're easy to see!!The steps themselves are simple and even the most un-coordinated person will have no trouble following along and keeping up! There's no way to go wrong with this tape! If you do the left side while she's doing the right, no problem! It's that easy!I really recommend this tape if you want a challenging workout!"
4,Definate leg shaper,"I love this tape. I'm not a K.S fan, but I wanted her legs and have them now! You do need to supplement this with some cardio, but ""no pun intended"" you will definately see results quickly with this tape. Definately one to add to your collection. It's also great when you just want to squeeze in a few minutes."
2,Spice it up a little,"I tried it and I was not impressed. In both ten minute segments she does the same leg movements. There isn't alot of variety. The video isn't very motivating either. The second segment is suppose to be more challenging than the first. It is a little more challenging, but not by much. It will work your thighs and calves, but if you are looking for more variety in leg exercises and motivation, I would try something else. Also, this video is for beginners. If your workouts are advanced, you may get bored and yearn for more after viewing this video the first time."
1,Left me wanting more,"First, if you are an advanced exerciser, you will quickly get bored with this one. This is definately a video for beginners. Also, I was bored because of the lack of motivation and the repetition of the same moves over and over again. The tape is split into two segments. The first is suppose to be less advanced than the second. Both segments were pretty low on the advanced scale. The second segment had the same moves as the first, you just did them a little faster and with a few more repetitions. I was very disappointed. I was looking for a good leg workout, and this was not it. If you are a beginner and don't need much motivation, maybe you will like it."
3,Fun and fast but not challenging enough,"I feel like this is a video to maintain my legs and butt during the winter months when I am wearing pants. However, it definitely does not give me the definition that incorporating dumbbells does or that similar lower body Tamilee Webb videos do. It's a great video if you are a beginner or want a tape you can use on days when you don't have time to exercise your legs to exhaustion. I wouldn't use this tape to get into peak physical shape, but it's great as a starter. I guess that's the functionally fit aspect. You won't get the muscle-by-muscle definition that exercising each part individually to fatigue will give you. However, she explains everything very well and keeps you motivated. I don't feel like my quadriceps got a good workout...I didn't even feel it. But, it will keep your glutes in shape and burn some calories in the process."
2,Too easy,I have a million work out dvd's and i love Kathy Smith's stuff but the exercises in this dvd are very simple and don't even come close to toning anything unless you haven't exercised in years. For someone who exercises often and has resonable tone in her legs this was too simple and unchalleging. If you just started working out this will be a good DVD for you but be aware that you will probably grow out of it after a couple of weeks.Not recommended for someonbe who works out more that twice a week.
5,"Love Kathy, she is a classic","I am a fitness vidiot and workout with videos often. Kathy is a long time respected instructor on film and this basic lower body workout does not disappoint. This is perfect for builds like myself, that seem to quickly gain muscle in my legs. It's challenging without the weights so I can still get the great lower body workout without having to heavy up resistance. She can be a little chatty, but she really isn't annoying."
2,word for confusing pictures,Thisbook was not helpful to me. It actually confused me sometimes and I really wasn't sure what the picture was actually supposed to be . Wasn't real precise. My Ukrainian girlfriend would tell me that some things were wrong according to her understanding.
3,Too much going on,"on each page, there is just too much. It's overwhelming. and the colors are very blah, it doesn't hold my little one's attention."
2,Makes a Nice Coloring Book,"To be fair to Rogers, I probably should not have tried to use this book anyway; I know I'm a phonics learner, not a word-recognition learner. But my problem with this book started even before I tried learning the words.The pictures are not in a Russian setting.In the school classroom, for example, the letters above the blackboard are Roman, not Cyrillic. Nothing in the book looks different than it would in a US or Canadian household.I can think of a small, dwindling class of people who need to quickly learn Russian words for American items: US parents adopting Russian orphans (I say ""dwindling"" due to changing Russian laws making it more difficult for Americans to do this). The rest of us need to learn about Russian culture while we're learning about Russian words. Why slow us down?I gave the book 1 star above 1 because it does do what it's supposed to do...barely. But that's not much. And for that, I could just look up words in an English-Russian dictionary."
2,Dissappointed,"This is a great book for people who can already read Russian, ecspecially for my kids because they can color in the objects as they're learning the words. (It's like a coloring book - so deffinitely more kid oriented.) However there aren't any translations into English nor are there any pronunciation guides, making it difficult to learn to actually say the words correctly."
2,Misspelled words!!,"First of all, this looks like a coloring book, which is OK, but should probably be in the description of the product. And secondly (more importantly!!) there are misspelled words! On p. 22, ""'''''''"" is written as ""'''''''"". This is unacceptable!"
1,Not for the English student of Russian,"Some of these types of vocabulary picture books are designed for native Russian speakers to learn English and not the other way around, but many of us native English speakers buy them in hopes of using them to learn Russian. The main problem with this and similar books is that the Russian words are not stress-marked, an essential feature for learning proper Russian pronunciation. So, you get a lot of words and their associated pictures, but nothing in the way of pronunciation help.That said, one can use this as an exercise in looking up Russian words in a good Russian/English dictionary and page by page, mark the stress yourself. Could be useful in memorizing the vocabulary and make a marginally useful book, more so. Good luck!"
3,"""Russian Picture Word Book""","""Russian Picture Word Book"" is a good vocabulary review of 500 or so commonly used objects and words. When I first opened it, I thought it was a child's coloring book rather than a Russian vocabulary review. However, on reflection, it will work for me to review the words contained inside. I might even get some colored pencils and color the objects in order to reinforce the words. It might be fun!!"
3,Easy to hacksaw through.,"The most vulnerable area of this is the end of the cable where it slides into the body and locks. All the cable strands are pressed together there, making it easy for a hacksaw to go through the soft metal. The tubular steel sleeve around it tends to rotate, which will necessitate holding it with channellocks, but once that is accomplished, it is just sawing through soft metal.But, it is a good visual deterrent to an uninformed thief, or one in a hurry."
3,incorrect photo,the lock has a plastic lid on the metal part which is not shown in the picture. The lock will not work without this part so the picture must be of a different model.
3,Not enough to make you a qualified mushroom gatherer,It is a good book but I dont feel like it gives me enough confidence to go out and pick some wild fungi for lunch. The possible consequences are too great. And this is why I bought the book- so I could go out and gather wild fungi. The book along with some trips with an experienced guide is what I need. The only thing I did not like about the book is that there are too many recipes. Iwould rather have had more pages devoted to identification.
2,more confused than before,"I came to US from Europe several years ago. It was a family tradition to go pick wild mushrooms every fall during my childhood years. So when I moved to Virginia countryside I decided I will try and revive the mushroom picking tradition in my new country. I started with a book to help me identify all those different, unfamiliar species of mushrooms. So I bought the ""Edible Wild Mushroom Guide"". I went to the woods and picked a bunch of different mushrooms - each one was different and tried to use the Guide to identify them . Out of about 14 visibly different species of mushrooms that I picked - the guide gave positive ID on ONE (!) mushroom only. Other 13 were not even included in the book. I can't testify to the quality of recepie part of the book - I was somewhat reluctant to cook things I can not identify!"
5,Edible Wild Mushrooms or North America: A Field to Kitchen Guide,"We have a number of other books that are more complete for field identification of all mushrooms (edible plus inedible), but no other book has such complete tasty recipes along with artful photographs of both raw mushrooms and the prepared dish. I keep it in my kitchen along with other cookbooks."
4,A Great Time-Waster (I Mean That in the Best Way),"A practical book, a beautiful book and a wonderful resource. Even if you have no need for a graphic design book, this would make a great coffee table book to impress your friends. For the graphic designer, fresh color combinations can (and have for me) changed the direction of an entire project. I work with small business clients in a wide range of businesses and have found this book invaluable for starting new projects, establishing an identity or finding a few neat color combos for a flyer. This book is worth the money!"
3,Global Color,"This book looks beautiful and does have many color combinations to inspire. I was disappointed by the lack of information on the background of why the countries covered would favor the colors they do. Also, Canada was not covered and sarcasm written about their tardy submission-so all Canadians should suffer because of this? The book would be useful if you have a number of color references already as this uses a different approach."
4,The Frenchman,"A very dark, and somewhat confusing story about a serial killer and the detective that is somehow linked to him. I found the novel very well written, yet I could not fully provide 5 stars because of the constant change in perspective and the various tenses (past and present) that were used. Still, this was definately a good read, and I could not put the book down until I was finished."
1,GREAT SHOW.....BAD DVD,"While Forever Knight is a fantastic show, this is one of the worst, if not THE worst TV DVD set I have ever seen. Columbia Tri-Star did NOTHING to clean the image of the film up. I own seasons 1-4 of MASH on DVD, and let me tell you that there was no other TV show that had such poor film quality. Well guess what...the MASH DVDs are beautiful, so TV show picture quality CAN BE improved. My VHS taped recordings off of Sci Fi channel are way better than this DVD set. Yes, that's how bad the picture quality is. Looking for Forever Knight extras? Don't look here. Columbia-Tri Star didn't include a SINGLE EXTRA feature. Quite frankly, if season 2 and 3 are this poorly done, count me out. I don't want them. A true shame this is. This is probably one of the finest, most under-appreciated TV shows of the 1990's. A true shame that the folks at Columbia Tri Star are too ignorant to do a DVD set right."
3,Disappointed,"I was very much disappointed to find out that the episodes are much shorter than the european episodes, even on the DVD version, cause the ""flashbacks"" are one the most important things in this series. And dear people who cut out all the ""nude"" scenes - you have never seen a REALLY nude scene in your whole life!!"
3,Why the cuts?,"Many of us have waited a long time for FK to be put an DVD. We were jumping for joy when we heard it was. Knowing now I didnt have to worry about my VHS tapes braking or wearing out. The clearity is great, the sound is great, and the box set up is fantastic. I was hoping on getting the canadian version, have the missing clips, but would be satisfied for the US version. BUT to my suprise I didnt even get that! What happened? Why did the cut out A LOT of scenes? Important scenes! Terrific scenes! ANY scenes?Going back to my VHS tapesVAMP"
1,"I loved the show, but Columbia Tristar is ripping you off...","Now, don't get me wrong -- this was one of my guilty pleasures from the early 90's, but I only give it one star because Amazon asks to rate the DVD, not the series. I cannot see paying this much money for a DVD set with absolutely ZERO extras, and the fact that the American version is extremely cut. Columbia is charging a premium price for not much effort on their part (I'd buy it if they at least included the uncut shows). So, I'll wait until our Canadian friends put out their version (from their show) before I buy it.Please read the review by Robert C. Rogers - he knows his facts!"
1,why american versions where is european footage,okay i give the series 5 no 10 stars but we are being screwed with dvds as even the highlander box sets had european versions of episodes we are missing 7 to 9 minutes out of each episode and as this has 22 episodes we are missing 154 to 198 minutes of footage im gonna wait till uk versions come out as i dont buy things twice.
3,Couldn't finish it,"After all the rave reviews I decided to give Forever Knight a try. Iliked the concept and the actors, but after five episodes into thefirst season, I couldn't get one thing out of my head: how dd Nickbecome a cop if he's a vampire? I mean, don't cops have to undergotraining of some sort? How could he have accomplish all of this if he's""allergic to the sun""? I understand them making him work thenight-shift as a result, but to become a cop means undergoing certainphysical and educational procedures (not sure the sunlight excuse wouldfly in this case). I know this is fiction, but the story needs to bebelievable to some degree for me to keep watching. Maybe it wasexplained later on, but after five episodes, I had enough. Shame,because I really liked Nick."
4,Better than expected,"I am a huge Geraint Wyn Davies fan... so off the bat I think this is a great collection. Quality of the dvd's I found much better than some of the other people who left reviews. The sound is terrific on my copy... in fact I can hear foot steps when characters are walking and all sorts of small sounds I never heard when the shows originally aired. I have no complaint on the syncing of voice over work, some other reviewers complained of this. I found it to be visually better on my dvd player and flat screen tv... terrific in fact. However, on my dvd player in computer it reflected the quality I recall from watching it originally on tv.It is a great collection and well worth the cost!"
5,Eye popping,This will be a great sell being that the show is so popular. But overall the DVD is a great idea. Excellent!!
4,Forever Knight - First Season,"A little scratched on Disc 3 so two shows slowed down, but I could view them. Loved the series, loved the stories, loved the actors - Scanky not so much!"
4,Happy with it..,"The item was ok, but I thought it's all music videos. But all in all I was satisfied with it."
4,From a former Army medic,"I was never with the Rangers or saw combat, but this was a great game, I did question some of the treatments that the game recommends, however besides that it was a blast. I definitely recommend this for anyone that has any military medical background. For the non-medical inclined person this game will require some extra reading. The graphics and some of the controls left something to be desired, at times trying to get the crosshairs on the part of the body to be treated was very difficult."
2,Neat game that doesn't work.,"After three re-installs, a software patch, and five emails to tech support I had to return this game. It's a neat game, but I could never play it past the first 2-3 minutes because it would crash. The key problem seems to be the Wild Tangent system it uses for the graphics.In a nutshell: Neat concept, lousy code. I would advise against it."
1,Game Wouldn't Install,"This game sounded interesting to me as a former combat medic. I tried to install this game and it took over my whole system ! ! ! My son (age 16) didn't want it, so I threw it away.Guy ""Doc"" LamunyonCombat Medic(...)"
1,Dont waste your money,"This movie is nothing more than amatuer camera men in strip clubs filming crack addicted women taking thier clothes off. Half of the footage looks like its from the early 80's... If you really want this movie, contact me, ill give you a great deal on the one i bought."
5,Love and death in Central America,"RED JUNGLE is a novel that transcends genre. It's a political thriller, an adventure story, a murder mystery and above all a story of obsessive love: love of family, of country, of money, of glory, and of the absolutely wrong person at the worst possible time.Russell Cruz-Price returns to his mother's homeland searching for something he can't name. What he finds is violence, passion, mystery and the hope -- however slight -- of redemption. RED JUNGLE ranks with THE QUIET AMERICAN and AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD as a classic story of clashing cultures and doomed romance. Don't miss it."
2,the Red Jungle,Very hard read... I couldnt finish it. Maybe I will try again someday. It could be because it isn't my type of book
1,A Lazy Author,"This book was poorly written, poorly constructed, and it was obvious the author did the bare minimum of research on all topics. I think reading the Wikipedia article on Guatemala would have provided more detail. The characters were wooden and non-sympathetic. The character motivations were either mystical or so two-dimensional that they were painful to read.It was obvious from the reading that the author had no idea what the plot of the book would be when he started writing. The historical flashbacks were largely pointless. The three plots in the book (politics, affair, archaeology) were disconnected and random. There was no tension in the book, just an inevitable plodding along, waiting for something to happen. Every opportunity to build it seems to have been wasted.All in all, not even a good airplane read."
5,Well Worth Reading,This book does an excellent job of providing the step by step information into what it takes to bring your idea to the market place. I highly recommend it.
4,Good fun,"One of few 'fun' movies regarding the military. It is set in a specific time period that many young persons may not grasp. It was the end of the old colonial period where a fading empire still had some stature and influence. Attenborough rightly deserves great credit for his charactarization of a British RSM. The supporting cast did a great job too. The special features has commentary by John Leyton which is worth listening to for the background.A good movie, well worth the purchase price."
4,Trouble in Africa,"This movie is about a British Army Training Team based in a African Country in the early 1960's. The country in question is a former British Colony and the British Army is there to assist in training and forming an army for this new country. A coup takes place at the start of move, with government being over thrown by rebel soldiers. The British Army Training Team are told to stay in their barracks and not get involved, but they don't.... The uniforms, weapons, props etc are very authentic for the period and the acting is very good. This is a classic movie and well worth looking at!!"
3,written,"was looking forward to the movie,but the co. did not have any in stock. Was refunded. i would do business with them again."
2,Hot Air,A movie with little action and a sergeant major with a big mouth that puts out a lot of hot air. This might be a good movie for someone going into the army.
5,Sunset For the Raj,"I have watched this film multiple times over the years. It is a great piece of miltaria, and a fine example of Sir Richard's tremendous range as an actor of the old school. The details of a mixed BA/native contingent Battalion in the last days of the Empire are spot on. The frustration of a proper RSM doing his duty in the manner that has served his sovereign and country well for decades only to be stimied by politics can be appreciated by current and former NCOs of all nations. I simply adore this movie."
5,Awesome Earrings!,"I got this for my wife a few days ago and she loves them!She loves the color and size of them, the only minor problem would be that the ""stem"" is a bit too short and she's afraid they may fall off, other that than this is a great quality set of earrings by Gem Avenue, highly recommend them!"
3,"Here is a fight listing for Pride 16 ""Beasts from the East""","The fights may not be in this order on the DVD. Fairly short card and missing some of the bigger names, although Akira Shoji rarely has a bad fight, the same for for Daijiro MatsuiAntonio Rodrigo Nogueira vs Mark ColemanDon Frye vs Gilbert YvelSemmy Schilt vs Akira ShojiRicardo Arona vs Guy MezgerMurilo Rua vs Daijiro MatsuiAssuerio Silva vs Yoshihisa YamamotoGary Goodridge vs Yoshiaki Yatsu"
4,A SPOTLESS STORY,"You've heard the old adage that a leopard can't change his spots. Well, that bit of folk wisdom doesn't deter Oscar, a rather naive leopard who wants his spots gone. He comes upon a magic potion that can do just that. As with so many ""magic potions"" there's a problem - Oscar overdoes and pretty soon he's not spotted but striped, covered with plaid, and all sorts of ridiculous colorings.Youngsters will smile and may also learn that it's best to recognize and be satisfied with who you are."
1,AVOID--the author is a cheat and running an unlawful business,"I was mislead by the author of this handbook, James Boerger, into using his vehicle shopping services [...] in Virginia. Despite his slick marketing and sales pitch, he cheated me out of the $395 ""consulting fee"" and did not honor his guaranteed money back savings. Through the tedious process of filing an official complaint through BBB and government, I was able to get my money back. I was later informed that he has been operating an unlawful business for the past 20 years and has cheated hundreds of people with his services.I don't know how someone so untrustworthy and unprofessional could be selected by AAA to author a Car Buyer's Handbook--ironic. I would not trust or believe anything he writes in this handbook."
5,Jewel's most consistent album,"Confessional folk-rock singer-songwriter Jewel has always delivered albums containing some great, memorable singles with the remainder being lots and lots of filler; her latest offering does not follow the same suit as previous releases, though. Instead, the album is the most consistent in Jewel's ten year career. From the enchanting opener ""Again and Again"" to fan-favorite ""Drive To You,"" to the beautiful ""Words Get In The Way"" and the sugary sweet delight ""Where You Are,"" this disc is far more enjoyable and engaging than any of its predecessors. Sure, it has its missteps as evident in the long slow slide that is ""Long Slow Slide,"" but the remainder of Jewel's new record is strong, consistent and highly entertaining."
3,back to basics,almost anyway. I'm glad jewel got away from her pop stuff. it was horrible. After reading her book I understand why it happened but it was still really awful to watch jewel try to glam anything up. The album was good and very relaxing but she didn't have the same fight in her.
5,I will avoid a bad pun...,"Jewel (thankfully) gives us a renewed sense of faith in her songwriting abilities with this, her latest release. I, personally, loved 0304, but this review isn't about that album.In ""Goodbye Alice in Wonderland,"" Jewel has managed to reclaim her emotional roots without sacrificing lyrical and melodic prowess (remember ""Spirit""?).I listened to the album pretty much straight through, and while a few tracks stood out as *exceptionally* good (""Good Day,"" ""Satellite,"" and ""Only One Too""), none of them let me down or left me feeling like something was missing.I will say that this album is the closest Jewel has come to recreating ""Pieces of You,"" but I hate that comparison because Jewel has obviously grown and changed through the years. Her music has grown and changed with her...for the better."
4,"Good, but lacking the typical Jewel variety","If you like Jewel you will probably like this. I was hoping for something with the same uniqueness and variety of ""Pieces of You"", but maybe next time."
3,I really wanted to like this....,"Wow. I love Jewel and have all her cd's expect for Pieces of You. I even stood by her with 0304 and I loved it. There is only one song that I skip on Spirit (Fat Boy) and I listen to This Way and 0304 without skipping any. That is pretty amazing to me, so I had high hopes for Alice. It's just not great for me. There are 2 songs I REALLY like, 4 that I skip, and the rest are just okay, they don't reel me in. I do love Jewel's voice so I'll give 3 stars. She has said this album is pretty autobiographical, but it seems to be mostly about unrequited love. It seems to be all about love me, love me, I'm so insecure. Which we all have been, but I think a song or two about that would have been enough. I would have loved songs telling a story--the whole story of her life, from the beginning--not just the love angst and fame part of her life. So, bottom line, I'm really disappointed."
4,Fantastic summer CD,"Jewel continues to outshine the current crop of pop, folk, rock feamle vocalists out there, and with Goodbye Alice.. she has again put out a neat album with back-to-back soothing, breathy, catchy and haunting lyrics and moving melodies. Her voice shines on tracks like ""Again and Again"", ""Long Slow Slide"" and Drive to You."" Personal favorites are ""Satellite"" and ""Last Dance Rodeo."" Every song on this CD is worthy of radio airplay and continual repeat play on your stereo or iPod. Whether its previous pop or folk releases or mellow rock like Goodbye Alice in Wonderland, Jewel again proves that she can do it all.. Brilliant."
2,Better than 0304,This album is better than 0304 but still lacks the brilliance of Jewels first 2 albums Pieces of You and Spirit. Ive been a fan since the release of Pieces of You but am dissapointed with the last few albums she has released. I reallt think that she could do better. This album has some really good songs but as a whole it is dissapointing.
2,EH.,"Jewel has lost it. Actually, she lost it quite some time ago, and has proven again that she's no closer to getting it back (and by 'it', I mean songwriting skills, and the ability to create a meaningful, powerful song). I used to love folky, funny, unpretentious, observant Jewel. I do NOT love 'let-me-sing-my-cheesy-diary-entries-and-call-it-a-record' Jewel. This record has a couple songs that are 'catchy' musically, but even those are irritating if you actually listen to the lyrics. I highly recommend skipping this record. If you appreciate intelligent music, check out Jackie Greene's 'American Myth' or anything else by Jackie Greene."
3,Well I like the pop songs...,"Jewel's ""Goodbye Alice in Wonderland"" has pretty good pop songs. Now I'm not such a fan of folk music but I will be judging however my favorite song and best one on the album which is her pop ballad ""Again and Again"" this track has to be 100% pure perfection, I love the lyrics, it's very poetic and graceful, and you can just tell she wrote this song from her heart the song overall is just spectacular and which is now one of my favorite songs to listen to. ""Drive To You"" is more like of one of those journey songs that tells a story behind the song, the track is great. ""Fragile Heart"" expresses Jewel's sensitive side, the song is a sweet melody to listen to. ""Where You Are"" is a very cute song and enjoyed listening to it as well. I recommend this album however more to folk listeners, and have to agree this album is her most autobiographical work to date."
4,Jewel back in form,"After the disappointing (to me at least - it's an acquired taste) 0304, Jewel has come back with a very good album that sounds more like her. Jewel is not exactly the same Jewel she was on Pieces Of You, though - it is an edgier effort. While she sounds forced on ""Satellite,"" ""Only One Too"" and ""Words Get In The Way"" are excellent rockers. I think the additional production on the album makes Jewel sound less precious. ""Stephenville, TX"" goes beyond her coffeehouse folk - it's definitely a favorite. As for the album's lyrics, if you've liked Jewel's lyrics before, you should like these. She tackled politics a little on ""America"" from 0304, and while I liked that song, I think world affairs are best tackled by artists like Pearl Jam and Pink. Overall, GBAIW continues the maturity shown on This Way."
2,Goodbye Alice? More like Goodbye Fanbase.,"I couldn't belive my ears when I heard this album. I was excited to buy another Jewel CD, as I have every single other one that has been released, but this was an unpleasant shock. The material is absolutely MISERABLE. This is the closest thing to a lyrical trainwreck as George Bush's last State of the Union address. If you close your eyes, you'd think you were hearing the same song for 60 minutes, with the occasional break or only mind-numbingly dumb song wording.I love Jewel's voice and she does some great things here. I love the quirky and interesting instrumentation on some of the songs. I enjoyed the interesting chords on a couple of the songs. BUT, overall this album is junk. I'm going to have to research who produced this and who her writers were. I only hope it's NOT Jewel herself."
4,Typical Jewel like album,"If you like Jewel, you'll like this album. Easy to listen to when you just want to hear some music and relax."
5,Excellent CD !!!!!!!,"I loved all of the songs on this CD. The themes and sujects discussed were very interesting. The music, the lyrics, and the overall songs were all very well put together, not to mention a little catchy. I highly recommend for any Jewel fans, not to mention any non-Jewel fans."
4,Jewel's best yet!,"Jewel was just here in VA and didmany songs from this release. Didthe Today Show w/ Rob Thomas (notex-football player either!), too.All songs reflect good song writingand her usual originality! Pick UpOn It!"
2,What ever happened to just Jewel and her Guitar?,"This album is pretty reflective of most of the country songs being made out there. They all have the same slicked over full sound that leaves little impression on the listener by the time your done with the song.This album seems to be produced not to offend anyone's listening sensabilities. They forgot to have to Jewel just step out there and sing. The most unique thing about Jewel is her voice and the music here tends to fill up too much of the space and flatten out the great vocals she can give.Best two tracks are ""Good Day"" and ""1000 Miles Away"" (very last track). The general theme of the album is a broken heart, the last track was more than enough to get that feeling across.Strip it down and get back to the basics, just Jewel and that great voice."
4,I like it,"I'm biased though, while I don't normally go for this musical style I do like Jewel's voice."
2,She's been going downhill since album #1 - No change here,"Both my wife and I liked the complete lack of Hollywood influence first album. Forget the message slants, the music itself was a pleasure to listen to. Now I think of what commercial would be most appropriate to play her new songs as background music.We had heard from a friend (probably a pop music lover) that this album was more like the first so we gave her another try.Definitely the last album I buy from Jewel."
5,A Special Book,"This is indeed a special book. Miriam Lee shares here insights into how to treat people in a busy acupuncture practice with minimal effort and maximum results, yet at the same time ensuring each patient is given quality time. The author covers treatment of common health problems in the West such as depression, allergies, asthma, diabetes and obesity. This she does using a core set of points which are mainly the 5 Shu (transport) points of the meridians and whose functions she explains with remarkable clarity. The book is a true inspiration for both beginning and experienced acupuncturists. Miriam Lee shows us not only how to heal patients, but also to consider our own intention as healers."
5,VERY easy to read!,I LOVE this book. I am beginning to study Acupuncture next year. This book is a great asset to my research and education.
5,excellent,very informative book.I would have liked some more from same author.she has a world of practical information to share
3,for instructors,This book is really intended for instructors and practioners. It dealt with an early pioneer in the USA and the slow and reluctant acceptance here. It isn't a lot of help to someone contemplating using acupuncture.
5,What a vampire book should be,"Just finished this book tonight. It's awesome! This is how I like vampires- as the monsters they are meant to be, not ""immortal lovers"" or high school students. The vampires in this are gritty, sleazy hookers that prey on lonely truckers at truck stops. They're not nice, they don't want to be your friend and they're not self hating whiners that cry over their lost humanity. I also like the setting for the book and found the characters likeable and realistic, one of my faves being Byron the janitor. I will definitely be reading Live Girls and Night Life, two more vampire novels by this author. This book is NOT for the Twilight crowd."
5,I dreamed a new world!,"I dreamed a new world as a result of this book by John Perkins, as well as ""Shapeshifting"" by him. I have become a new person -- happier and much more fulfilled. I can't wait to read his new book ""Spirit of the Shuar"" which has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. His true stories are magnificent teachers!"
5,John Perkins,"Perkins is a 50 plus year old former International businessman who made the transition from a tool of the modern day robber barrons to a spiritually concerned member of the human race. I suggest that his books be read in the order of their publication to really understand the mans evolution. His body of work should be in the high schools of all the countries that are sucking up the worlds resources. Then, maybe, with a generation of informed people the planet can change it's course from a head on collision with disaster to a place where people understand the bounty of this world must be properly allocated and the appropriate opportunities are available for everyone. There is to much in his books to write about here. An automatic for any person wondering how the world really works and how it could work."
5,The world is as you dream it,"I thought this book was great. I have been journeying for years, so it hits home. Its fascinating to read about other cultures so far from our own. Yet since journeying has some common traits, its wonderful."
4,The Official CompuServe 2000 Tour guide,I thought the book was very easy to understand. The book has very easy directions to follow. Even if you are not very good at computers. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it needed a little more imformation in it for beginners. Now we need a book for CS 6.0
1,THIS DVD IS AWFUL!!!,"I bought this dvd because I found it for $9.99 and thought for over 12 hours of workouts that was a great deal - I checked the release date and it was 2002 - so I wasn't worried. I put in the first tape, though, and wow!! Talk about outdated! I had a really hard time getting past the little things (like hot pink shiny workout outfits and girls with short bangs curled and hairsprayed) - still - I figured I'd give another workout a try and I couldn't even get through the intro. - it was a segment talking about backcare that was simply outdated and too much to take...waste of money."
1,very misleading,"I was very excited when I first saw this set. So I bought it not thinking that these were programs so outdated, if I did I never would have bought it. The cover information is very misleading. It gives all these great programs that you can workout with but nowhere on the cover or back does it say that these are all programs 15 years old or more."
1,Very Generic Outdated Video,"This was a good idea, put 10 different types of workouts on one dvd set. Nice concept, right?? Well they ruined it by using the oldest most generic videos, that probably didn't sell back in 1988. I only watched the beginning of most of them. There were some Funky Aerobics on one of them and they had some funky outfits to go with them. The TaiFit is not nearly as good as Billy Blanks TaeBo. I watched more of the Jazzthetics than anything, because it was so funny. Obvious Traci Lords thought so too, because I noticed her laughing in some spots. And I wouldn't recommend doing sit-ups like she did, I think she was trying her best to make her chin touch her chest.I recommend not wasting your money on this dvd set and instead build you a 10 best workouts slowly. Maybe buy Kathy Smith Kickboxing now and a Taebo later, etc."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was so excited when I bought this DVD because I thought that I was getting a good value. Boy was I in for a shock! I like to sit down and watch the workout tape before I actually do it and to my shock and horror, this was not a new workout series, not even within the last 10 years. Boring, yawn!"
1,DONT BUY THIS DVD!,"This DVD is very poor and is somewhat dangerous in places. I have other DVDs such as Tae-Bo, Kathy Smith's kickboxing workout and Karen Voight's circuit training - ten best is not a patch on any of these. The cueing on some of the workouts is terrible. Some are so old and include bouncing stretches - anyone who is currently into exercising would know that this brings a risk of injury.The Tae-Fit workouts dont really get your heartrate going like Tae-Bo but seem to be the best and most recent workouts on the DVD. The front cover lead me to believe it was a dvd with new workouts - not based on 1980's style moves!In all, a poor purchase and I am returning my copy soon!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD!!!!,"(...) TCheesy and very low budget are the best words to describe these DVDs. The instructors are a big joke, especially the guy on the ""Fat Burning"" portion who is wearing neon orange tights that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination (and he is scrawny and hairy, also)...not a pretty sight. Then you've got Traci Lords doing aerobics in a teeny tiny bikini, which may appeal to some but that's not something I want to watch! I think the director forgot to tell her that this isn't a porno (she closes her eyes and breathes heavily quite a bit).I basically put each DVD in and watched the first few minutes of each one and that will be the last time they are ever near my DVD player."
3,I do like one of the workouts!,"I agree with everyone else. This is very dated and cheesy. I was so excited when I bought this - thought the concept was good. I bought this at a Name Store, and it was one of the few workout videos they had on the shelf that wasn't yoga. So I am very disappointed that this is all you can get out there. But on the fat burners dvd - there is one workout that has funky aerobics, hot bods and baby boomers aerobics. The Hot Bods and baby boomers are 30 minutes each and they are pretty good. You have to ignore the outfits, though. I laughed my behind off, I did one of the other aerobics programs and I had to stop after 5 minutes and just sat there and laughed. My 3 year old came into the room and asked what the weird girl was doing on the tv. It was actually a man in a one piece black leotard with a white belt!!"
1,Absolutely terrible,"I was also excited when I ordered this but it was terrible. Very outdated and a complete waste of money. Yes, it is cheap, but I wouldn't take it if it was given to me. Its just taking up a spot on my dvd shelf, reminding me that I was dumb to order it without looking at reviews first."
1,Don't do it!,"Unfortunatly, since it's opened I cannot return it, so I hope someone out there will avoid this horrific incident. Do not buy this set, not worth it."
1,Leave it at the store!!!!!!!,I was excited to buy the box set because I thought since it had different types of workouts that meant I would never get bored. When I played one of the DVD's it was so outdated and the DVD began pausing on it's own and pixelating. Most of the DVD's were poor copies. Not worth the money. It's not even good if it was free.DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!
2,Old but functional,"If you don't care whether or not your workout is updated and the quality great, this is a good DVD for the price. It has a lot of variety. I'm not too sure of the Tracy Lord workout. Doesn't seem too effective. In fact, some parts may be down right dangerous (bouncing stretches, throwing yourself all over the place). The others make you move and that is what you want to do. It is a complitation of some VERY old workouts but exercise is exercise. If you want a bargain for a variety of workouts this is for you, if you don't care about quality. Consider you get 10 workouts for less than...If you are into the latest trend in exercise stay away from this. You will be greatly disappointed. However, if you found the old routines (80's, 90's) effective, these will work out just fine for you."
2,"Old, outdated material","I looked up each of the programs contained on this DVD - you can search for them by title on amazon.The only programs that received any sort of good rating are: Kick Butt and Tai Fit. Both of those programs received excellent reviews. Yogacize received an ok review.The rest of them? Old outdated material from the 80's. Think - 80's clothes, 80's hair, 80's people.... and 80's style of aerobics. Do you want that?The JazzThetics? Please! It has Traci Lords! She's a porn star! It received the lowest rating out of *any* of the programs - even from the idiots who bought it just to watch a porn star bounce around.If you want to spend the money to receive 3 good programs, and possible one or two others that might be ""ok"" to fit into your routine, go ahead and buy this.Myself, I'm going to spend the money get DVD's that I *know* I will use. That's why I cancelled my order."
5,Here's What You Do,"Wow / Grape Jam is incomplete. So is Columbia Legacy's Vintage.Answer....Buy both albums (Amazon's other buying options still has some copies of Vintage for around $15/disc - which in California is a third of a fill up for a camery).Take the best cuts of both, and put them on a blank disc (the only song you wont have is the (very spacy) the Lake, and the announcement to turn your platter speed from 33 1/3 to 78 for Just Like Gene Autry, a foxtrot that was on the original WOW album.This album reminds me a lot of Buffalo Springfield Again. Pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band.Enjoy.Incidentally, you can do this, add The Place And The Time (original version - from Vintage), Miller's Blues (Live - from Vintage), and still have around 7 minutes to mess around with. Great for a car backup."
4,Can't be so bad...,"I guess I'm the odd man out in these reviews, but this is my favorite Grape album. There is alot of variation in style and songwriting, ranging from morbid humor (Motorcycle Irene) to psychedelia to folk rock to revvved up blues shouts, and even a 78 rpm goofy oldie sort of tune (WHY WAS IT CUT FROM THE CD?). The jam numbers are fine, and the extra LP was a very cool bonus (and a gimick) back in 1968 when the LP first came out (think of these tracks as the 1960s version of bonus cuts). Jeers to whoever made the decision to edit and remove tracks on the CD release (their evil manager?). If you can, find an old LP and burn yourself a CD. If you can't, this is a very good San Francisco 60s rock album. Hmmm---now that I think of it, my current record player doesn't have a 78 rpm setting, so I guess I'm technologically cut off from hearing ""Just like Gene Autrey"" until a better CD release comes out."
4,Not bad for a bunch of Bay Area boys,"A pretty good effort, considering the times, my only questions are these- Who was ""Bucky"" in the Jam album, why was he so unlucky, and why hasn't ""Truly Fine Citizen"" been put on CD? OK, and quick, now...what nearly famous guitarist, singer, writer started out with the 13th Floor Elevators (same era)?"
2,sophomore effort falls flat on its grape,"most critics describe this album as a veritable disaster following the perfection that was their self-titled lp. i concur completely. the songs are nowhere up to the standards of the first and the production effectively sinks the entire album. great songs like he, rose colored eyes, and, especially bitter wind are ruined. the two bright spots are the rockers murder in my heart and motorcycle irene. the ""grape jam"" portion is a complete waste of time, pure hippie boredom. your best bet with this group is to find a copy of the now deleted 2-cd set vintage, which has not only the entire first album, but cherry picks the best of the later material plus includes some great unreleased songs like rounder, skip's song, and the original bitter wind which tears this one apart. final analysis-they coulda been contenders."
1,"A Great Album, a Horrible Manager and His Discs","When ""Wow"" was issued in 1968, it featured a 78 RPM track called ""Just Like Gene Autry;A Fox-Trot"". Where is it here? ""Bitter Wind"" had a sound collage at the end, where is it? The bonus ""Grape Jam"" LP ran near 40 minutes long. So where is the missing 13-15 minutes? Matthew Katz has done it again at ripping the band off. Avoid this disc at all costs and go for the out of print ""Vintage"" or the original LPs. This is a disgrace."
3,CD missing key elements of album,"I wore out two copies of the vinyl ""Wow/Grape Jam"" set in my youth and was happy to see that it was available in CD format. I was extremely disappointed to discover that this is not the same record that I enjoyed listening to in the past. Missing from Wow are two key elements: the song ""Just Like Gene Autrey"" which was played at 78 rpm on the original LP, and the second half of the song ""Bitter Wind"". Missing from Grape Jam is ""The Lake"". Also,the cover art has been altered to make room for advertisments. I urge anyone interested in this record to seek out a vinyl copy and to avoid this CD."
4,What was SFS thinking when they repackaged this?,"I loved this album as a kid. I was really looking forward to hearing it on CD. Imagine my surprise when I found they not only truncated songs early (Bitter Wind) but chose to leave off a song entirely. I REALLY wish I would have read the other reviews here before I purchased. Still love the album, hate the label. If you can get ""Vintage"", do so, (although it's out of print). It has most of what's missing here (not the last part of one of the jams, though.)"
4,still classic grape,"i too am sick of people regarding this album as terrible or subpar. some clown in rolling stone had the audacity to give this 1 star once! its not as good as the 1st record, but very, very few albums are. although it has been tampered with it is still a considerably above average album by one of the very greatest aggregations in the history of american rock , one that would blow any of these horrible bands from today clear out of the water if they existed at the same time. and these other reviewers are correct in that vintage is essential listening. just about every track on here is a classic in its own right, and this is a varied and interesting recording that shows us many wonderful sides to this amazing band. one would have liked to have seen the cd reissued as it originally appeared without editing, but that is probably too much to expect from the nefarious matthew katz..."
4,ink,"The name fits. It does indeed dry quickly, a little too quickly when temps. go up over 80 degrees. Added a little water to the sponge resevoir and discoverd a little more working time without sacrificing line quality, actually improved the consistency of the line. May need to try the waterproof stuff."
2,This book is now out of print -- the author,"""Supplement to Final Exit"" is now out of print. BUTa newer version (2002) is available in the 'double-book""""Let Me Die Before I Wake & Supplement to Final Exit"" By Derek Humphry..."
4,great help for sondheim lovers,"It is really nice to be able to get a hold of some of the songs from follies that aren't available somwhere else. Many a time I wanted to go on an audtioned armed with Buddy's Blues from follies, but alas, it was nt available in it's entirety until this book! Follies is one of Sondheim's best and it contains songs for every type of singer and actor from the comic to the chanteuse. Not to mention some of the best songs ever written for the theater. Of note: ""Losing My Mind"", ""Buddy's Blues"", and the classics ""I'm still here"" and ""Broadway Baby"". This book is also great for the non singing musician, the arrangements are quite nice and quite challenging. enjoy!"
4,Texmark Rechargeable portable pump,This pump is a great size and powerfull. It blew up a hi-rise twin bed in a couple of minutes.The only negative is the attachment nozzles do not lock on so I found they fell off easily.
5,Great airpump for camping!,"Great little pump, expecially with option to recharge it while you're driving around in your car. Easily pumps up or deflates at least 3 mattresses on one charge. Delivers a lot of air, very quickly and very quietly. Very pleased with this product."
2,Won't deflate effectively & takes too long to recharge,"This unit is low output for both inflate & deflate. But deflating an air mattress just seems to never get finished. I (wisely) also bought a Texsport Double Action Pump, which is manually operated, and it will very effectively deflate completely. Inflation is faster than the electric pump depending on how hard you want to work."
3,Good but could be better!,"After using a hand pump for two years, this product was a welcomed change. We bought it and needed to use it immediately for some guests we had. The disappointment was, it has to be charged. It doesn't work by just plugging it in. You have to charge it over night which for us, was too late. When we finally had it charged it worked great, so quickly. As long as you remember to charge it the day before (ish), you'll be pleased."
3,A mixture of good and sappy,"There are spots of brilliance in this book, and unfortunately much larger spots of sappy material, such as codes for airports or peculiar numbers that happen to be palindromes. Palindromes are an art form, perhaps the most constrained art form, and some, like those of J. A. Lindon, are sublime. The author himself contributes a few very good original examples. He also slavishly quotes a number of other sources and in particular is treats everything by Lindon as a work of genius. Lindon was admittedly good, but not quite that good. The author's scholarly work in finding the sources of famous palindromes is not superficial. The worst feature of the book is that the author cannot resist adding an inane 'explanation' after almost all entries. The book would have been better with about half its content excised."
5,"Look no further,heres the future","My friend gave me this cd,Im into all the britpop bands and we were talking about all the bands that have lost thier way(the tears,the last few belle and sabestian cds,travis,ect)so he handed my this cd by Voxtrot and said this is what all those bands should be doing.I was amazed by what I was hearing.Voxtrot capture the sound of many britpop bands(smiths,b & s ,travis) and add to it.The first thing I thought was Morrissey should have these guys open for him.Its that good.I love Raised by wolves and long haul.Buy this"
4,worth purchasing,"such playful arrangements make it hard for the listener not to fall in love with this album, i love the ep and hope for a full length album soon, ""the start of something"" is truly a masterpiece in itself, their lo fi retro style really wouldnt be out of place on a garage sale vinyl rack, im happy with the purchase and would reccomend to britpop/pop music lovers everywhere"
3,Small and Efficient,"A great little book on beer, it covers a big topic in a small efficient book. The book format is more like a technical reference and very repetitious. Lack of an index greatly diminishes the value and usefulness of the book. Still, the first 2 chapters as well as the introduction to each chapter are great and very readable. The last chapter on home brewing is also nice. These parts make the book well worth the price just for these parts. If it had an index I could give it another star and maybe two.I found this book in an airport book store. When you search for beer on Amazon it never shows up. I do not understand why. It is just too new and up-to-date."
4,Thorough Coverage Outweighs Flaws,"If I were to recommend any DVD to someone just starting out exercising, it would be this one. Kathy Smith doesn't just give you cardio workouts, high intensity workouts, or weight lifting. She gives you two sessions of each, allowing you to build your week. I have used this DVD five days a week for six months, and still find it effective. I like that I have the choice to pick and choose, and yet I also have the structure of something I am familiar with. I will agree with the other reviewers that the cardio workout is hard to learn at first, that the warm-ups are missing, and that there is no section that works out your abs. But you can easily overcome these flaws (take a little time to learn the routine, warm up yourself, and substitute your own ab workout). Rarely do you find such a good mix of workouts on one DVD. It's worth every cent."
2,choppy,this workout does not flow well. there is a complete lack of warm up and no focus on the abdominals. some of the sections are targeting only one or two muscle groups. difficult to do some of the moves in a living room because of the lack of space.
3,Read reviews before purchasing they really are helpful,"Regarding this Kathy Smith video, I must agree with a number of the other reviewers in that there is not any structured warmup or cool down session, an important item for any workout. It does not seem like it would be that hard for them to have added these choices since this is an interactive dvd. In the beginning of the video there is a section that explains the logic of fatburning, and how to structure you workout, then the video itself is structured for you to be able to tailor what you are doing to get results based on their logic---the major part that is missing is the warmup and cooldown. As for each of the individual sections of workout, they were pretty helpful but leaving you feeling kind of breathless between segments, without a good transition stage, and a bit hyper when done unless you add your own cooldown. Hope this helps......."
3,Pretty okay for a compilation,"This workout is divided into ""best of"" sections of high impact cardio and low impact cardio in 15 and 20 minute segments. The cardio is okay, but there aren't any warm up or cool downs which I think is a real drawback. Also, one workout is with a jump rope which I think is silly because most people who bought this are working out at home, so jumping rope is impractical. The weight training sections are really good , but there is no ab section so that was disappointing. Overall, something I will use several times per week."
5,Quiet Gem,"George Cukor, Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon were the best kind of fans for Judy Holliday; they made it possible for her to create great roles in wonderful pictures. From her carefully-sheparded movie debut in a supporting role in ADAM'S RIB (where Katherine Hepburn graciously yielded the screen to Judy's comic talents) to her Oscar-winning turn repeating her Broadway success in BORN YESTERDAY, Holliday gave us an unforgettable gallery of women, and her work was never finer than in THE MARRYING KIND. Matched with Cukor's protoge (ahem!), Aldo Ray, Judy is remarkable in this role, playing an ordinary housewife whose marriage is on the brink of dissolving. Her big scene in the park mid-picture is a perfect example of her unique ability to make you laugh and break your heart in quick succession. Lovely, lovely work from all concerned, and an extremely rewarding small movie that casts a big shadow."
2,DONT BUY UNLESS U TRAVEL A LOT,"Hi landed up paying $47 for this junk only because its the only dual voltage clock -- works in all countries. The display is UNDERLIT making it UNREADABLE even at 03 feet in the dark so daytime forget it ! Everything else works ok but beware as I learnt, No battery backup , if the power jinks you are dead ! the damn thing has no memory to retain time and even a one second power on off will KILL YOUR DAY ! Oh I forgot ! U can't program the CD Track or Radio Station U wake up to !"
3,Warning!,"I bought this battery as a backup power supply for my Sony MVC-CD500. While my camera model was listed among those this battery is supposed to work for, and while it claims to replace the Sony NP-FM50 battery my camera wont work with it.The battery seems to work fine, camera starts up and reads the CD then a message flashed on the LCD telling me to use the Sony brand battery and the camera shuts down. I wasted my money on this battery. Thought I'd warn others about the brand sabotage that Sony built into the MVC-CD500."
1,POS,If you own a Seires2 TiVo DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT buy this receiver.Even though Phillips Electronics makes the DSX5500 and Tivo they are NOT compatible.The IR blaster will NEVER work properly with this unit.3 thumbs down.
2,Pick something else,"I had a Sony receiver but after 8 years it went out and couldn't be replaced. This model is slow, has a very poor picture - red's bleed. My Sony didn't have this problem! I called Philips about it - not helpful at all. Am seriously considering throwing it out for another model and calling it an expensive lessons learned!"
3,receiver,before you by this item please look to see if the person selling the item says that it is what it is and that it is in the condition that it is to be or even better post a real picture of the product so that the buyer can see first hand of they want to buy the product
2,Alright,I got three of these recivers as part of an offer with directv. After 1 year I got tired of the small lettering and fuzzy picture. I had been over to a friends house that had the RCA DRD435RH madle reciver and loved it! I then bought those to replce these peice of junk recivers.
2,Hard to see guide,"Pros: costCons: Hard to see program guide,small lettering on guide,remote may not work with all televisions,only 3 day advance schedule,and might have to press remote's 2 or 3 times to get the channel you desired."
3,not like the playmobile I had when I was a kid,"We got this for my sons fifth birthday because I remember how much I loved playing with playmobile as a kid. Both of my boys loved playing with the castle once we finally got it put together. The problem is it doesn't stay together. One month after receiving this and putting it together, the castle is in pieces all over the house and I don't think we'll ever get it back together."
2,Disappointing,"After 3 hours of assembly last Christmas, it was in pieces the next day. It was months before we finally put it together again - piece by piece with hot glue and it still came apart and is in pieces once again. AAARGGHH!!! Give me a quality toy that doesn't have to be constantly maintained! I purposely looked for quality toys last year - without batteries and junk plastic parts. This toy seemed to fit the bill, but it did not live up to my expectations. Ditto for the Playmobile pirate ship, but it was even more notorious for lying around in pieces."
4,Solid and Entertaining Audio Production,"Well produced and acted audio play covers the trial of Lucifer himself as he petitions to be returned to heaven. The question for the jury {12 good ghosts and true} to consider is this ""Has the devil been the instigator of misery and depredation in human history, or merely a passive observer and collector?""The writing is uneven at times and the conclusion will not satisfy all {more likely or not it will enrage devout Christians} but the strong performances and effective foley effects and background score make for a worthwhile addition to anyone's audio library."
1,Awful,"So much of Mr. Barker's work is amazing but this was so retarded, I just had stop listening to it."
1,"""Various Artists"" is not what you may think","This *is* a collection of hits from the 80's, but it sure isn't the original performers. I got this, expecting to get a great collection of hits from that era, and it was more like a visit to a karaoke club (although they have better singers than the aforementioned venue). Look for the performer's name next to the title on best hits collections to ensure that you get what you are looking for."
4,A definite for those who are new to the negotiating game.,"Having spent time negotiating sports sponsorship contracts, I have a new found love for negotiating. In reading this book, the authors have laid out a clear and concise program in which to begin, work through and close negotiatings. A great book for beginners and a good brush up for intermediates and pros."
1,"In one word ""Bad""","I am sorry I've bought this book:1. The authors do not seem to know the subject well.2. Lengthy, wordy.3. Refers to films on every second paragraph.4. Doesn't give any useful excercise, shows the opinion of a single author and lacks useful diagrams, images or quotes.Bottom line - waste of time and money (and I do feel dummy for getting it)"
2,Look elsewhere,"This book is very unorganized and not well presented. It's obvious that the author, who is a lawyer, has no experience writing books. I strongly believe that the author and the publisher have the ability to do a better job."
5,Darkness prevails,"The only saving grace of this latest release of The Stone Flower is the superb performance of the incomparable husband/wife team of Maximova and Vasiliev.Unfortunately, darkness prevails throughout the entire video,obscuring many fine dances by the the Corps as well as the principals.That is a shame, as this is a fine ballet,what was the lighting director thinking? Stage and set design were dark and gloomy as well. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain, danced by Svetlana Adirkhaeva,was artistically sound, but technically weak. Her jetes,lifts and control, were tentative,but then maybe she couldn't see all that well in the darkness.In general,if you want to see Katia and Volodya at their usual best,this performance is a must for those who remember them in their glory as I do.I give this production Five++++ stars for their performance alone."
1,Buy something else,"I don't know what this tool is good for, but cutting dovetails isn't it. For one, the blade is too thick. Dovetail cuts require a thin, sharp, precision cut.Second, the blade wasn't very sharp when I received it. Therefore the cut it made was sloppy. Save the $10 and put it towards a quality product!"
5,By Far The Best Debut Album So Far This Year,"When I first heard JMC'S debut single ""Alyssa Lies"", I knew right away he had something different than other newcomer country artists in a good way.However, I knew that i'd have to hear the whole album to know how much I liked him.Take it from me, go ahead and buy it you will not be disappointed.From start to finish this is a great album, nothing is there that I want to skip I can just sit and listen to every song.Don't listen to the 2 star review, this is not a ""forgetable"" artist.Few new artists these days make such a big impact in country music, but I feel JMC will be around for years.On this album you will find a big variety of songs including upbeat and fun songs,sad songs and love songs.Buy this one now and try it out for yourself."
5,Great Music,"Every song is excellent....one of my favorites is ""I Can Sleep When I'm Dead"". There will be many hits off this one. Great voice out of this guy, he's a newcomer but he'll be around for a long time.Buy this cd, you won't regret it."
2,PAINT BY NUMBERS CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY,"Sounding and looking like a cross between Trace Adkins and Dierks Bentley, Jason Michael Carroll follows his Top Ten single ""Alyssa Lies,"" a standard tearjerker about child abuse, with his debut album with a little help from Jewel. The bottom line is this is standard stuff, undistinguished and undistinguishable from almost everything else out in the marketplace. Jason Michael Carroll is an unexceptional singer and you have to sit through a lot of ""been there heard that"" songs before you get to the album's best efforts ""Angel Of Broken Hearts"" and ""Let It Rain,"" which are the last 2 songs on the CD. He's a serviceable singer but no better or worse than a million others. This reminds me of an old Johnny Rodriguez song - Pass Him By 'Cause He's Only Passing Through."
5,Great CD-listen to the whole CD and not skip a track!,"First to the lady with the comment about the upside down cross. It is not an upside down cross-it is a dragon holding an Irish celtic cross in it's mouth. It was a gift from one of his managers. Knowing Jason, he would never blaspheme the Cross of Christ. As to the CD, it is one of the few CD's I can listen to and not have to skip a track. Mostly, I like that I can hear and understand the words. The songs are beautiful, meaningful, and they all come out with the right voice and music combination. My favorites are ""Angel of Broken Hearts"". ""Let it Rain"", ""Love Won't Let Me"", and of course ""Alyssa Lies""."
3,Jason Michael Carroll - Waitin in the Country,"Waitin in the Country is the debut lp from contemporary newbie Jason Michael Carroll. For the most part, the music here is enjoyable and radio friendly. Livin Our Love Song is sure to bring in more than just a handful of fans. Not everything here is great, though, like the just okay Anywhere USA and the dated, corny toby keith rip-off Honky Tonk Friends (just the title should give that away). Thankfully, I can only think of two poor tracks, so this one is probably worth buying."
3,Just one question. . .,"Alyssa Lies is a very powerful, emotional song. But I have just one question. .Why is the cross on his necklace upside down? It's that way in several of his promo shots. . .Hmmmm Jason, you're messing around with your largest fan base there. . ."
5,Hilarious!,Mike Reiss is one of the top Jewish humorists in the field of Christmas literature. This book is a must-read for anyone who's ever thought about saving Christmas.
5,My Grandson LOVES Elmo and this video!,"My Grandson, who is 2, just loves Elmo. If you have a young one that is into Elmo / Sesame Street this is a definite addition you will want to make to your DVD collection. Includes some musical sequences that my Grandson really likes and he will remain ""glued"" to the video for its duration. (I have mixed feelings regarding this.) Good entertainment for children under 5."
1,One Great Cut and Lots of Garbage,Don and Dewey is fantastic bounce-in-your-seat fiddle music. Everything else is mediocre to downright awful. Don't waste your money.
1,rjsdenco,"What a disaapointment! After devotedly listening to their first album for 37 years, I thought I'd take a chance on this one. $21.00 down the drain. This thing really sucks. They switched from edgey to mellow for this one. As Woody Allen says in Annie Hall, the next step after mellow is to ripen and rot. The music, with a few stolen Jerry Garcia riffs, never rocks and rolls. It does a deliver a lot of stupid new agey messages, however. Save your money."
5,One of the best,"I have been listening to Strung Out since the early years, and this album is amazing. This album sounds like the Old school Strung Out with some f'n edge. Thank you strung out for putting out an album with some passion if I had to listen to anymore commercial punk I was going to kill myself."
3,Not what you are used to from this band,"I read all the reviews about this album and purchased it anyway. It is not near as good as previous efforts, however, I would have purchased it no matter what just to say I have all of Strung Out's albums. Unless you are a die hard fan, I say skip it. If you are just getting into Strung Out, you'd be better served going with Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues or Twisted by Design."
2,Their worst work,"For such a talented band, this album is a terrible dissapointment. The production is far too overdone and the the song writing is the most generic Ive ever heard from this band. Musically, they sound great. Jason sounds like he has more work done on his voice than Cher does on her albums, and Jordan does the most standard fills to be found on any Strung Out album. This is basically just an album they put out so they could tour. I am a fan of EVERY Strung Out album, and I love their heavier sounding stuff of the last few albums. This one, however, is a waste of time for anyone looking for a killer disc."
4,Please enter a title for your review,At first I just felt let down by this album but after a while of listening I've separated the wheat from the chaff and found an excellent ep in there. This is the tracklist for the album as I listen to it:1> all the nations2> dirty little secret3> diver4> downtown5> a war called home6> party in the hills7> letter home
3,Hoping it will grow on me,"I've been listening to the CD all week and I just can't get into it. The songs seem...uninspired. Even the few standout tracks on Blackhawks wouldn't be standouts on previous works from Strung Out. This being one of my favorite bands, I am hoping that the more I listen the more I will like, but it hasn't happened yet."
5,great book,great book make my son laugh and repeatd rymths make it great for kids to remember this book and tell a long story while you read
3,"Tasty, but not individually wrapped cookies...of yesteryear",Picked up a two pack on the Friday sale a few weeks ago. I was surprised that the cookies are tiny (dime sized domes) and are no longer wrapped in twos in the paper - like they used to be. They still have the same great angelfood cake taste though....
4,vera brittain : a life,"It was quite an enjoyable read for us Brittain and Holtby fans. It interesting how she is still relevent in this day and age, how she really doesn't seem ""dead"" from a forgotten era. In this book you can find the little tidbits about Vera that speak to your own emotions even now, that make the person whole."
4,Bursts not intense enough,"Fun, easy to follow, great toning, but some of the 2 minute bursts of aerobics aren't very challenging. After 1 or 2 trys I didn't feel that I was being pushed. Maybe 2 minutes isn't long enough. I wouldn't begin with this video if you're just getting into aerobics because you might get too accustomed to the breaks.Nevertheless, K. Smith is easy to follow, informative, and is the first video instructor to explain the difference between a plie and a squat."
4,Effective lower body workout,"I have been using Kathy Smith fitness tapes since 1989 and this is one of her best. What keeps me coming back to Kathy's videotapes is that she is knowledgeable about fitness. She gives clear and easy to follow instructions throughout the workout. I purchased this tape in February 2000 and I use it consistently at least twice a week in conjunction with other fitness videos. I hate to exercise, but I'm still using this video each week. It's best for those who are interested in an overall workout with emphasis on the lower body."
3,This video is not for the beginner,"I am a 28 year old woman trying to get into shape. I haven't worked out in 3 years. I am not very well coordinated and had a very hard time following the steps. I tried doing the tape 5 times and still had a hard time trying to figure out the moves. I did sweat a lot and she definitly keeps you moving. I was just so frustrated with trying to keep up and figure out what she was doing to really enjoy the workout. I think this tape would be good for someone who is already used to working out. If you are a beginner like me, I think something slower paced would be better."
4,Goes down easy,"I am a person who hates to exercise. Having said this, I really, really like this tape. I like the fact that you can use the different intensity levels. At one point, I was doing the high intensity workout, and after I had recovered from surgery, I was doing the low one, and still getting a challenging workout. I also like the fact that the steps are very easy, as I don't like dancy tapes. I just want to sweat, not try out for the Rockettes. I also like the fact that Kathy is probably as unirritating as a fitness host is ever going to be. I say this because I find most hosts on these tapes to act and chirp like lobotomized cheerleaders and Kathy does not. She's more like a normal person who's helping you along."
5,A Great Workout!,"I did this workout a minimum of 3x/week, combined with Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds in 6 months. The interval training seemed to help increase my metabolism which has started to slow since turning 40. I sweat during and even long after the workout is finished. My body feels great afterwards and my legs are toned and shaped. I have many workout videos, but this is the one I always come back to. Try it, you won't be sorry. Jude"
2,dissapointing,"Based on previous recommendations I purchased this tape and I was very dissapointed. I believe if I would jump 15 minutes around the room, I would achieve the same benefit. Instructions are hard to follow, and I am not willing to memorize the tape! This was my first purchase of Kathy Smith video and I believe also my last.I give her some credit for a stretching at the end of the tape, it was nice. Maybe her stretching and yoga videos are much better, but I will stick with The Firm tapes for fitness because they produce real results."
2,"Not very challenging or energizing, but great for a beginner","In as much as I enjoy exercise, I really did not find much excitement or challenge in this video. The routines were basic and the music boring. I did not even break a sweat. I really enjoy interval training, however Kathy Smith's intervals lacked the intensity that I am used to. On a more positive note, I think that this video would be a great introduction to interval training for a beginner or someone who is out of shape. I just need something a bit more rigorous than this."
1,For beginners only!!!!,"YAWN! It's for beginners only. No two ways about it. I don't understand how anyone who works out on a regular basis can rate this video as one affording the burning of any fat. The time spent actually doing aerobics is soooo breif you don't get a sweat going, and you don't get your heart rate up at all. Not at all. Zip. Nothing. This is probably a very useful video for those who are very over weight and out of cardiovascular shape. For those who are in fair to good shape and work out frequently - this tape is not for you. The chorography was fine, but if you want to really get the heart rate going, pass this tape by. I'm going to post mine to sell ASAP. What a wast of money."
3,Good workout isn't exciting,"Why Good: I'm busy and I pop it in and get a good cardio workout with leg work. A quickie video. Why not-so-good: Introduction is too long. (put it in a pamplet) Music lacks and just boring. I don't get excited, AT ALL, about popping it into my machine. Overall: If you just want to get exercise over with, it works. Looking for a mental & physical jolt, this ain't it."
5,Use it all the time,"This is a video that I bought when I felt ready to move on to intermediate from beginner. I was immediately challenged by the two minute high intensity aerobic intervals. The cool down portions with lower body toning were moderately challenging. Now I do the advanced aerobic moves and work up a good sweat. I like the interval aspect of this video, because I feel like I am getting a lot done in 40 minutes."
5,Another great Kathy Smith workout,"Kathy is my favorite instructor- she is enthusiastic, easy to follow, and the 2 minute circuits on this workout are just tough enough."
5,I love this video...,"I was an exercise drop out and recently started up again. Since I hadn't bought a new tape in years, I decided to go with my favorite, Kathy Smith. I am so glad that I did. This workout gave me the best workout I have ever experienced from a video. Smith's directions are clear and concise, though sometimes I was tripping over my own feet. She has good modifiers that are still challenging. Since I hadn't exercized in a while, I didn't think that I would be able to keep up, but the modifiers do help and her encouraging attitude kept me going. The cooldown definitely should have been longer and the stretch section should be longer as well. But all in all, this video is more than worth the money."
4,I really like this workout,"Kathy really gets your heart pumping on this one! If you're in great shape, maybe this tape is too short, but at about 40 minutes, it's good for beginners and intermediates. Yes, the music is a little cheesy, but who cares if the tape is giving you a good workout? I recommend it highly."
5,Great all-round routine,"This workout is definitely one of my favorites. It's an excellent mixture of aerobics and toning. The aerobics can be done low or high impact and will get your heart pumping. Smith's cueing is good, and none of the six ""intervals,"" which consist of three complimentary movements, is overly difficult to learn. The music is OK, and the group behind Smith is mercifully quiet. I do have two complaints about this and all the other Smith tapes I own: As a woman with bad knees, I wish Smith would dump the fast left-right knee lifts. It's impossible to do the movements without jerking your body around and putting your knees at risk for straining. Second, I wish Smith would spend the extra bucks to fix obvious mistakes in the audio (like when she tells you twice in the same interval that ""this is the last time through""--cruel!). These errors would be very easy to fix in post-production."
3,Burning Fat With Kathy Smith,"The workout is fairly tough. Lots of squats, and 4 -5 windsprints. I believe it delivers what it promises. I just wish they would have a brief heart-rate count."
2,Disappointed,"I have used alot of workout videos and this one was one of the worst. If you know dance you may enjoy it, but if you don't then look out! Everytime they would teach you a new step they would switch off from person to person so that you could not get the step down. I was lost from the beginning, and turned it off halfway through (which I have never done before). She should include dance in the title and save us (non-dancers) the trouble."
2,wouldn't recommend,"didn't get a great workout. her moves are simple, but the combinations are frustratingly difficult. i would say it would be great for a starter because it's not a hard workout, but the combinations can get confusing. money is better spent on a better video. i recommend Minna Lessig."
3,Okay for an intermediate workout,"I have a variety of workout videos, and I find this one okay, but not that great. The moves are pretty fun and easy to follow and the cueing is good, but the music is tacky and does not even follow the moves. It is quiet and easy to ignore, but I prefer a good beat to follow.This workout uses interval training format, with 6 two minute intense intervals followed by a two minute active recovery in which you slow right down and do strengthening exercices. One thing I don't like is that the transition between the interval and the active recovery is too abrupt and choppy. I have another interval training video which has much smoother transitions.Other than that, it's okay, but I only use this video once in a while for variety's sake."
3,not difficult to do,"After reading the reviews for this DVD, I decided to buy it and try it out for myself. I am relatively fit (workout 4-5x/week for more than an hour), and I broke into a mild sweat. The DVD is ok, but not that exciting and definitely not challenging. The background music is very blah. I dont think there is enough exercises in this coz I always feel I need more after the dvd ends. Probably good for light lazy days when you can't get to the gym."
5,Always a favorite...,"This has been my number-one favorite workout for years! I initially had it on VHS, and finally upgraded to DVD. The workout is really upbeat and fun, and really gets your heart pumping. Great for cardio days, alternating with weight training days. No special equipment necessary."
3,Don't really care for it,"This tape is a bit too dancey for me. I was looking for something that was not like typical aerobics and but I was disappointed. I really do not enjoy doing it at all and don't feel like I've gotten a good workout. The tape that I would recommend is ""The MTV Total Body Workout"" No dancing here just a hard-core total body routine that will leave you KNOWING that you have worked out. Skip the Kathy Smith!"
1,This taught me nothing,I bought this planet as a guide for my moving to Singapore. It taught me nothing about the country. Following a girl around to scope out foods only eaten on fear factor and meeting people who inspect public toilets. How is this useful information for tourists?

3,Jolson Story,"The Al Jolson Story is very well done as a movie. The sad thing is that it is obvious that his wife did not want to accept the fact that she would have to live for the rest of her life with a man who was obsessed with himself and notoriety. The story brought out clearly that Mr. Jolson loved entertaining better than his wife or a family. Whether or not this was true about the man is debatable, but that is what was clearly communicated in this version of the Al Jolson Story."
3,great music lousy Jolson,"why Harry Cohn passed up using Al Jolson to play himself is one of the great injustices of cinema. so what if he looked old in the screen tests we're talking one of the top performers of all time here, perhaps the greatest. larry parks is wooden in comparison to the way the beloved Jolie moved, just watch the real Jolson do 'Swanee' in the movie, the only time they used him and then from a distance. The man was electric, its painful watching Parks but hearing Jolson, better you close your eyes and imagine the real Al. Evelyn Keyes has a few nice dance moves too."
5,A performer forgotten.,"If you lived when Al Jolson was singing this movie will bring tears to your eyes. A great performance by Larry Parks, the only one he ever gave.The music is great, but I'm sure most people today will disagree. That's because today they don't play music only noise."
4,The Real Al Jolson,"I first saw this movie over 40 years ago when I was 12 on TV at my aunts house, and it was a magical experience I will never forget. When I recently watched the DVD release, the movie still had all the elements that made such an impression on me many years ago. Everyone who has commented have stated that Jolson did the actual singing for the film, but this is not mentioned in any of the credits. Why was this? When originally released, did the studio try to make everyone believe that Parks was doing a good imiation of Jolson? I thought there might be something at the end of the movie, but the DVD version abruptly ends as soon as THE END fades from the screen. It would have been nice if the DVD had included a short segment addressing how the movie was made with Jolson's real recordings."
5,The Jolson Story,"I remember seeing THE JOLSON STORY on the big screen when I was a kid - and I remember how impressed I was with the film and especially the performance of Larry Parks.It may be the greatest job of lip-syncing ever seen on film. Jolson's voice was never better, and although the story was probably not all that accurate dealing with the facts ofJolson's life, the movie was highly entertaining. How sad that Parks was unfairly dragged into the McCarthy Witch Hunt Trials just when his career was taking off.So many great songs - and such a perfect supporting cast!"
5,Jolson Story,I just love this movie. A true story and the music and singing is so great and in addition you get a love story not only of a man and lady but of a man and his music. You'll want to see Jolson sings again after seeing this one so buy them both.
5,excellent film,"I have bought this film as a Christmas gift although I have seen it several times, its a very moving story ""get out the tissues"", I would recomend this film to young and old alike you will enjoy it, its a good sing along film also, Larry Parkes doe's a great job playing Jolson but the voice is of course Al's, if he had not gone on the stage then Al would have made an excellent cantor. 10 out of 10 for this film."
3,"""And the Waters Turned Mediocre...""","The sheer mediocrity of this book is stunning. It seems to be split into two main parts. The first half of the book is about the actual investigating of the organism and is quite compelling. However, the second half of the book is about a poorly covered up conspiracy theory and is very repetetive. This is dry and is pretty boring. Therefore, the two halves balance each other out to make it mediocre. This book is very good, though, in showing the life and career of a scientist, so would be great for an aspiring scientist. It also reveals the state of the waters in North Carolina, a concern to any of the state's citizens."
2,a piece of yellow journalism,"Aside from the literary value of this book which I am not going to judge, get this from a genuine Pfiesteria researcher, me:Pfiesteria was NEVER proven to be the causative agent in the fish kills described in the book. Associated yes. Causative no. Big difference.There's a growing body of evidence that it is actually NOT causative, all published in peer reviewed journals [...]Pfiesteria toxin was never identified and it is entirely possible that Pfiesteria is one of many dinoflagellates that does not make a toxin.As a matter of fact, the National Institutes of Health pulled the plug on funding for research into the effects of Pfiesteria toxin on humans shortly after a CDC sponsored Pfiesteria conference (CDC National Conference on Pfiesteria: From Biology to Public Health October 18-20, 2000, Atlanta GA).Please read this book as ""fiction""."
3,And The Waters Turned To Blood,"this book is about this woman Dr. Burkholder who discovered pfiesteria. we enjoyed this book because it not only told us pfiesteria, it also told us about her personnel reviwe and made the book interesting.things that we did not like about the book was towards the end , it all came down to politics."
4,And the Waters Turned to Blood,"Rodney Barker's novel had a good environment aspect indealing with Pfiesteria. Overall, the story and main idea was not too bad and learning what harm this organism can cause is a shocker. However, the novel seemed to drag on in discussing the personal lives of new people introduced in every chapter. It was more interesting in the beginning when she first learned about the dinoflagellate but really got too long about halfway through. It is still a good book to keep on the list because Burkholder's research and experience is beneficial to science and shows ans important topic later discussed in our textbooks."
4,Mr. Rush's APES period 6,"The book ""And the Waters Turned to Blood"" provided personal insight of scientists and victims towards the harmful dinaflagellate Pfiesteria. The book also provides an upsetting portrayal of politicians by exposing their attempts to cover up the truth about the harmful toxin. The book is also able to explain complicated scientific research in a way that high school students can understand. Even though there are times of randomness, the book provides a descriptive account of the terrors that have plagued the North Carolina waters for years."
3,And the waters turned to politics,"We had to read this book for a school assignment. The beginning of the bool started off with a good plot. It was interesting, want to know what was going to happen. After about half way through it started to become too political and too many character came into the story. The book dropped characters such as Mike and Dr. Noga we never find out what happens to them. The fact that we live in RAeigh made the story come closer to home. Despite the slow and repetitious plot, the movel made each of us more aware of the enviromental and health concerns involved with Pfiesteria."
4,great job,"Rodney Barker writes a stunning, spectactular, and mysterious novel about the dangers of a microscopic killer. He writes with amazing detail on actual accounts. The suspense keeps the reader glued to every page. However, the book is designed only for people with advanced interest in science. The book can get technical, but always returns the reader to a suspenseful plot. This book isn't for everyone but if you're intrigued by science, it's the book for you!"
1,Bombastic Drivel by a Hate Mongering Fool,"Obviously Mr. Tulbure has spent not a moment with an Arab or a Muslim person nor a second in the Middle East. I would not pay a penny to read this trash. The review by his ""rent-an-editor"" should be enough for any serious-minded adult to realize that this is the work of an egomaniacal child. He is so full of himself that he's actually paid XLibris at least $500 in the hope of further spreading this self-serving defamation of an entire race. Use your hard-earned money to buy Islam by the enlightened Karen Armstrong instead.He thinks so highly of himself that he goes by the name of ""Maximus Illuminati"". ""Minimus Illiterati"" I'd say. Surely his writings must be a ploy to see just how many people he can dupe into buying them."
1,The Tragic Truth About This Book,The tragic truth about this book is that it was written by a man who obviously has nothing worthwhile to say and many hours to say it. I purchased this book as source material for a paper and wasted my money. There is nothing substantive to use. I hope I can sell it again but I fear this will be impossible if word gets out about the book before I do.
1,Lynne H. Schultz is WRONG,"...Just because one witnesses Muslims behaving in one part of the world, doesn't mean they are like that in every country. All the countries that are predominantly muslim live in their own way, some more traditional and some more modern...Islam IS about peace, but there are some people out there giving it a bad name and trying to use the religion as a way of getting people to listen, just like people have done for all of time."
3,Before you buy these pulls.....,"These pulls have a couple of points of concern to note before purchasing. First the screws provided are quite long, and unless your drawer or door is thicker than normal, they will not work. I had some shorter screws and washers that I used. Additionally, I had to enlarge all of the drawer pull holes because of the thickness of the handle part that inserted into the drawer holes. This required a fairly large drill bit and careful drilling to keep the wood from splintering around the hole. The hardware itself is good quality and looks nice, but putting them on was not the quick and easy job I expected it to be. Had I not had the drill, large bit, and other screws, I would have sent them back."
2,It took forever,It has been over a week since I ordered it and they haven't even taken the money out of my account yet. I have no idea when I am going to get it. I would cancel it if I could. Don't order from them unless you don't need the order for a month.
2,Disappointed,"Ozzy is the best, but whoever put this DVD together needs to find another job. It has no structure whatsoever. I recommend Don't Blame Me which follows Ozzy from his childhood to No More Tears. And MTV recently made a biography on him so if you're a die-hard Ozzy fan then be watching for it to come out on DVD."
3,Short but enjoyable!,It had some cool footage. I like the part when they were being inducted into the rock of fame. Definately a KEEPER!
1,Moby Grape Gets It Again From Matthew Katz,"In the never ending saga of bad mistakes of Moby Grape comes this entry in their catalog; a Matthew Katz-produced-and-released album. Of course, by buying this you gleefully fork over your bucks so Matthew Katz can afford to sue the Moby Grape. And, in his oft-time go after It's A Beautiful Day. Please, do everyone a favor and don't buy this. It's great music, but you can afford to pass on it. Moby Grape can't."
4,underground San Francisco Sound,"This Cd has good music ,very difficult or almost imposible to get in any other CD to find it.The sound recording is good .For me this 4 star."
4,Cell phone charger,"This charger was delivered quickly and the quality was great, I would recommend this seller to anyone looking for a replacement or additional charger."
5,The Best,"I really love this movie Richard Widmark is the best,great story line,good actors all around,have lost count of how many times I've watched it.Highly recommend it."
2,Got worse as it went along,"The first 75% of the movie isn't too bad compared to most of the silly, mythical West movies of the 1950's. It's beautifully filmed in Arizona (where it's supposed to be taking place, as well), with vast vistas of canyons and mountains. However, the last 25% is far fetched like a silly 1950's western with an absurd ending."
4,Trademark Widmark,"The Last Wagon is an outstanding example of what seems to be the Golden Age of American Westerns- the 1950's. Richard Widmark is doing what he does best: portraying an ornery, but honorable wronged man. Characterization is kept simple, yet realistic. For example, the response of the people of the wagon train toward the animalistic lawman who has captured Comanche Tod is very authentic. It shows a theme running through the film that justice is more important than the law.Widmark's use of Indian skills keeps his ""anti-hero"" interesting. As his motley crew tries to keep up with him, they learn valuable lessons in not only survival, but character. I originally caught this movie one night packing for a trip, and just could not stop watching it. Bigger screen TVs are helping to bring back appreciation for the beautiful panoramic on-location shots of the American West. The Last Wagon has a good story and some wonderful views free of phone towers and windmill farms."
1,Broken in the box!,"This grinder didn't get great reviews anyway....but the one I received was poor construction and fell apart in the box it was shipped in! Of course Amazon was great about the return & refund, but what a disappointment!"
2,No Lifespan!,"I loved this grinder when we first got it because we use a french press, an automatic coffee pot, and an espresso maker. The array of grinds is wonderful! If it only lasted.... I had the same problem as everyone else, the ring broke & I found myself shoving paper in just to get a seal. Would be a superior product if they made it to last."
3,It's pretty basic,"It's OK, but it's pretty basic. You have to load it every time, adn when done, you have to turn it over and hit it so the coffee will separate from the grinder. Also, as the last reviewer said, it is hard to work the lever to get the amount of cups you want. Sometimes, you have to go from the top and count the clicks to know how many cups you want. A good thing about it is that it is really small, so it will not take up much counter space."
3,As far as blade grinders go...,"I purchased this on a recommendation from a friend's mother, and I am basically pleased with it; although, I'm about to toss this one in order to ""upgrade"" to a burr grinder.Despite what many coffee connaisseurs will pretend, blade grinders are good enough for your basic press pot and drip coffee. If you're into espresso, then you should invest in a more expesive grinder, period.One major drawback to this model is that the old grinds seem to get permanently ""stuck"" in the grind basin."
2,Liked until it broke,We bought this model because it had the different grind capabilities. It quit working after 1 year. We also bought one for my mom and her's quit much sooner. :-(
2,Not great...,"I didn't care for this grinder. It creates a ton of static when it's grinding so that the grounds stick to the cup, the grinder, your hands, everything, and make mess. It's also a bit of a pain to have to make sure the lid is completely locked before grinding... if you get a bit of grounds in the locking area, it gets very finicky. It also won't grind the beans evenly. I get beans crushed to powder and nearly whole in the same cup."
3,The stocker's bible,"This book is from about 1971, so it does not have a complete history of blocks since then. But what it does have can come in pretty handy at times when trying to figure out orginal motor configurations. not alot of Cleveland info."
4,Pretty Good,"Works well. It's a bit larger than I expected which makes placemet difficult, but once you get comfortable with it its great"
2,Where is this guy coming from?,"I'm three-quarters of the way through this thing and I still don't know where this author is coming from. Sometimes he seems to embrace the tastes of the supposed masses, other times he puts them down and embraces the aesthetics of the fringes.The author also reaches some downright offensive conclusions: according to him, the reaction of the baby-boomer generation to the killing of the four students at Kent State ""exposed much of the peace-and-love generation as bandwagon jumpers whose dissidence was merely a fad that they were not willing to die for. Excuse me?Plus Mr. Austen, Fanny was not ""a lesbian rock group"". I don't know where the hell you got that from."
1,Terrible Product,"Got season 4 of The Sopranos in the mail, let me say I was extremely disappointed!! It came in some crappy cases from a video rental store, the discs were scratched, terrible!! I understand that I bought a used set, but the others that I bought came in the original box set and had very few scratches! Don't know if I am buying from these guys again!!"
4,Shift in Focus,"There were great moments in the 4th Season, but I wasn't as caught up in the momentum of the storyline as I was the first three seasons. The shift toward the domestic relationships was interesting, but domestic relationships are the part of the Sopranos' life we can relate too.It's that THEIR relationships are connected to a dark, unpredictable underworld that makes it so different.My favorite scene has to be Christopher's mob-styled ""intervention."" The marital meltdown that climaxed the season was as raw and painful as watching a real husband and wife Armaggeddon (and I've seen a few in real life). James Gandolfini and Edie Falco deservedly won Emmys just for those scenes alone.As a lot of critics and people here have said, THE SOPRANOS on a slow day is still better than the best of any other television show."
4,"As Good, Better than ever","I found the fourth season to be at least as good as the third. The acting was excellent, particularly the last episode's marital bust-up:very realistically done by all.I've read that the currently being-filmed fifth season might spill into a sixth: so many new characters are introduced. I look forward to seeing the fifth, but think I'll have to buy a DVD player to do so. I was able to see the previous seasons in VHS, but the fourth is probably the last such available."
2,Sopranos 4th Season DVD Set,"I was thinking I was getting the box set Iike from all of the other buyers, when I purchased mine, I received 1 disc case with 4 discs in it.Threej"
2,The LAST season! Really...,I used to Love this series when it first aired. I bought all the dvd box sets and watched every sun night always waiting for the new episode.But I feel this fourth season set is the last in the series as James Gandolfini and greed derailed this last years(almost 2 years!) worth of episodes!The fourth season was indeed dull and I found myself waiting for Six feet under instead.So enjoy the first 3 seasons and remember a great show that is no more...too bad.
1,Get out the holy water,"Season 4 is dead. Get out the holy water. THey spend too much time on Tony's kids and wife problems. If you think season 4 sucks, wait til you see season 5. THey should re-name the show to ""Tony's family""..."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Seasons 1 & 2 were awesome, the episodes drew you in and seemed to fly by. By season 4, the acting is still good, but the topics are uninteresting and there is very little action. They even tease you a few times into expecting somebody will get ""clipped"", and then the hits are called off. I think the show got so many awards they began to think they could pull off too many interesting character moments. The writers need to get off their high horse and go back to what made the show so great. I never thought I would say this about The Soprano's: B-O-R-I-N-G!"
1,another sell-out,"david chase said there would only be 3 seasons of the sopranos. HBO tossed a truck load of money at him and changed his mind. does it show? you bet. this is atrocious TV. the episodes are pointless and degrading to the brilliance that the show aspired to. unfortunately, too many people go ahead and defend something that was once great without looking at it objectively. empires fall, people, and the sopranos have fallen. the characters, situations, concepts, story-lines and subplots are misguided, come from nowhere, go nowhere and are dull. episodes like the columbus day parade episode are a travesty. have they really run out of ideas in only three seasons? as much as i hate low-brow manipulation, 24 is putting the sopranos to shame. they should have quit while they were ahead and PLEASE STOP PRODUCING GARBAGE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS PAYING YOU MILLIONS FOR IT!oh, the acting is still brilliant - from all of them - they just have nothing decent to work with."
1,INCOMPLETED SEASON,"HI IRECEIVED MY DVD SERIES WITH TWO DISCS REPEATED AND ONE MISSING, NEVER SEND ME THE MISSING COPY AND I HAVE TO SEND A PICTURE OF REPEATED DISCS LIKE PROOF OF MY RECLAIM."
4,Sopranos; 4th season,"very good on the whole. don't really care for the 'Janice' character. find the character annoying, but think the acting is poor too. the rest of the characters were very good."
5,Another winner!,"Like the three seasons prior, Sopranos four scores very highly in every aspect. Initially I was slighly disappointed with the pace, constantly wondering where the story was leading and who would be at the inevitable victim in the finale (seeing as Ralphie met with his gruesome end half way through). This being said, the season leaves so many unanswered questions and far too many 'loose-ends' which I look forward to being answered in season 5."
1,A complete season of BAD ACTING,"Ok everyone. I will boycott the sh*t out of this godawful show for as long as i have a breath in my body. Has anyone notice that this show is about as real as the jetsons? Jackass was the best show ever. It can never be topped. Well, hell at least the jetsons is written better. It seems someones addicted to smack, smacking woman and at the same time seems to be going thrugh the mafia ladder. Wow!! hate to blow the season for you. Even the boy in the bubble had a deck of cards....... Boring. I dont care what the episodes are called, they all have the same plot. This show is nothing short of a soap opera. i would honestly rather watch the bold and the beautiful before this show anyday. BAD"
1,"""Sopranos""= ""World Champion of the 'F-Word' andDrug Addicts""","I am a high school teacher and I watched one episodeof the ""Sopranos"", and I was shocked. I told all of my studentsto never watch such ""TRASH"". Why?Because during one hour, the actors used the""F-word"" 52 times, smoked pot, sniffed cocain,injected heroine into their veins and murderedan innocent police officer at his house.Everything these disgusting actors do are actionswe teach our children not to do."
4,True to life characters,"In many ways, this is the most realistic show on TV I think. The characters have foul mouths and poor morals, just like many people in New Jersey (sorry, but it's true. I went there one time and you would not believe how people talk there, even the women. Lots of loud arguments in public as well). Also, I have seen a lot of movies about La Cosa Nostra (which means Mafia in Latin), and the way the characters act here running their various criminal enterprises is very realistic. I would not be surprised to find out that some of the writers themselves were involved in organized crime as they seem to know a lot about the subject. The guy who plays the uncle is good too."
1,Terrible Cookbook,"I am a vegetarian who loves cheese and was very excited about this book. I was sorely disappointed when it arrived. The recipes look like they came from a frozen TV dinner collection, and are remarkably bland and repetitive. Unless you want a cookbook with a multitude of minor variations on the same cheese casserole, avoid at all costs."
2,misleading labelling,"This product was advertised as handling two discrete 'phone lines, but it has only two leads in the 'phone socket (i.e., for a single line). I replaced it with a Dynex from BestBuy, which had 4 leads, for two-line protection, at, incidentally, a far better price."
2,Butterfly pushpins,Product not as expected. Too tiny to even be cute. They easily fall off cork board. Can not hold much more than I small piece of paper. Overpriced!
2,"Meh, young kids may like it","I think my niece and nephew played with it twice. I don't like it because there isn't much to do with it. As soon as you draw on it, the image goes away. Where is the fun in that? I'd rather have bought a Lite Brite. I had a ton of fun with that when I was a kid and in my opinion is a better bang for your buck."
3,I had high expectations from this product BUT,"It was relatively expensive and the promising options turned out to make my girls' life more difficult; meaning, it blinks, and enables to draw a dotted line and more, but you have to push a button on the pen to get the line on the board, this takes away from the fun and creativity as well as from being spontaneous and drawing what they feel like drawing. Also, the lines get very light and faded. not recommended."
2,"Interesting idea, but...","...the pictures fade way too fast! I don't know how they drew the photos on the box, because ours disappear by the time we get to the other end. Drawing slower makes the lines stay longer, but since it takes longer to draw, the result is the same -- the beginning fades out before you're done. Using the templates is a neat idea, but by the time you get done tracing the end, the beginning is fading out. Having to hold the button on the pen down the whole time is awkward. Cord between pen and base is a little too short.Clever idea to draw with light and have it fade, but a poor implementation."
4,Niiiiiiiiccccccceeeeeeeee!,"My 3 year old son received this for his birthday and OMG, it is fabulous! It is one of the few toys he will sit and play with for awhile. When friends come over, they too, will sit and play with it! I find myself on the floor helping/drawing, too, when my son has it out!! A really good buy for the holidays :O) especially for the price!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,ITS NOT A FUN TOY WASTE OF MONEY BEFORE YOU THE CHILD CAN WRITE A LETTER IT ERASES SO FAST WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
2,Fisher Price Light Sketcher.,When it 1st came out I went and spend $30 on it.Let me say that I just bought my youngest daughter the toy story glow board on amazon a couple weeks ago for the sale price of $7.99 and if I compare the two I would've never spend $30 on this one.The pen never broke off I can say that.Your child will draw a beautiful picture that she can't show you as it tries to fast.
1,Not much fun at all! Don't waste your money.,"We got this for our son's birthday. By far the most annoying and distracting attribute are the bright lights accross it that blink constantly no matter what setting it's on. You've got to hold the pen's button down to draw, and the lines are not that crisp. And you can't erase the design -- You've got to wait for it to fade (only about 3 minutes, but that's an eternity to a child).Overall, good old markers/crayons and paper a much better investment."
1,HURTS YOUR EYES! Would NOT buy!,"We got this for my son's birthday last week and I'm SO thankful I tried it out before letting him play with it. The light reflected off the white page and burned my eyes. I nly played with it for about 2 minutes and my eyes were watering, then they started to burn and I put it away. We took it back to the store and I've even contacted the maker about it. I would NOT give this toy to a child because they might not understand that the reason their eyes are watering is because of the toy."
1,regret i got one,"i have just bought this fisher price light sketches for my son because he loves to draw specially those got light. therefore, i bought one for him. but i was dissapointted by this product. It is not friendly to my son at all.... If you want to draw, you got to hold and press the pen button once you let go... you can't draw. even you draw already, the line is not clear and you can't erase. you got to wait for minutes for it to fake off... my son hate it."
1,these are awful,"Dont buy it. I got the kids both one for Xmas and one didnt work when it arrived. We changed the batteries and still didnt work. The second one barely works, same issue. Couldnt get my money back from Amazon because I had bought it in October for Xmas and it was past the 30 days so I wasted $60."
2,Frustrating toy with little control!! Dissapointed- buy a doodle pro!,"My daughter, 5, just received this as a birthday present- pretty dissapointed that she is not in control of the writing- you can't erase it when you choose(it fades very slowly) and on the flip side when working with stencils to create a scene or any indepth drawing that takes longer than a minute to create- it is faded before you can finish - let along admire it. She'll be much happier with the doodle pro she'll receive for Christmas. And yes the lights are annoying- and painful to sensitive eyes. They may be safe as the manufacturer claims but they sure don't feel safe!"
2,My son broke it on day three!,"My son received this as a 5th birthday present on Saturday. It's now Tuesday, and he brought his new favorite toy to daycare with him today. He started dragging it around by the pen and the toy was taken and put away where it couldn't be broken. I picked him up and the pen no longer lights up, even though the wires are still connected and whatnot. The main pad lights up, just not the light.Bottom line: it's a piece of junk. Save your $25 and get a Magna Doodle."
2,breaks easily!!,"when i bought it, it was working perfectly fine and i liked how it held a decent amount of songs that i wanted. but after a while, it started to...well, break down. i dropped it once, and the volume button got busted. I dropped it another time and it just wouldn't turn on. (i even tried replacing the battery). so if you are SURE that you won't drop it and take care of it like a baby, go ahead and get it. but my honest opinion, i wish i spent my money on something worth getting, and something that would last more than 3 months."
1,Darn thing broke after just 5 months of use,"I had this player for only 5 months. I only used it in the car, it didn't have a hard life. But now it will no longer turn on. The warrenty expires after just 90 days, so I am out of luck. I have other RIOS that are great, but I bought a 1GB card and the sport is the only one that can use it.But I won't get another RIO sport to replace it. The hunt is on for a differnt MP3 player.Oh well, to bad RIO made this one so poorly."
4,Nice little player; but what's with the belt clip?,"Good quality player. I own both this one and the Rio Sport. This one holds way more music; the drawback is that the belt clip is -- to put it nicely, no good. The belt clip on the Rio Sport attaches to my running shorts waistband. I hate armbands, so either I have all the music I want bouncing around in the pocket of my shorts, or I do without the variety and use my Rio Sport, but have it attached the way I want."
1,Rio Forge -- It only has a 90 day warranty for a reason.,"My daughter's Rio Forge 512 MP3 player stopped communicating with any USB port on any of our machines. Hours of web based trouble shooting and tech support time didn't make any difference. When we tried to return it 94 months after we bought it), we were told that its 90 day warranty was up and they would not take it back. I have had yogurt last in the fridge longer than this MP3 player. Save your dollars and look for a company that offers real support and a real warranty."
4,Five star player with 1/2 star software,"The Rio Forge is really lightweight; it uses an AAA battery and it's battery life is much better than an I-Pod; it holds enough songs for a weekend of hiking. It's only failing so far (4 months) is the software. Sometimes my Rio software doesn't recognize that the Rio is connected. It certainly isn't intuitive, and some things I haven't figured out yet. I have the previous Rio, a mini ipod, and the Forge. Dollar for dollar, though, this is one of the better MP3 buys. I'd take the Rio over the ipod if I were going for a weekend of outdoor stuff. The ipod holds more but the Rio is lighter and battery life much better. The earphones are even worse than Apple's. I use and highly recommend Sony earbuds if you can get used to the short left and long right bud wire."
1,DO NOT buy RIO!!!!,"This product will work fine for the first month or two that you own it, but then will just stop working. There are solutions on their website to fix it, however it is about a 30 min process, erases ALL your songs, and happens about once a month for the rest of its life. I contacted RIO about the problem today, and the customer service lady said ALL their MP3 players do this, and its considered ""normal,"" and then she hung up on me!!! I am reporting this company to the BBB... DO NOT BUY RIO PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Your basic MP3 player.,"I bought this mp3 player back in 2003 and 7 years later I'm leaving this review! So call me a procastinator! But this mp3 player worked great with the songs I uploaded to it. The FM radio never really worked too well. It was very easy to make playlists and the buttons were easy to manipulate while running. The arm band is very comfortable and in fact, I still use the armband with other mp3 players that I have since purchased. The only negative thing I can say aboout this device is that 512MB is not that much memory. So if you have more than a hundred songs or so, this player will probably not hold all of your music."
2,"lots of problems, poor customer support","Ive had this player for just over two weeks. Adding an extra 512MB SD external card. I downloaded my music relatively very easy, only to get a message that there is insufficient internal memory to create index. Out of the 512MB I am only using 460MB of internal memory. Does it really require more than 52MB to create one? thats 10% of capacity...the unit seems sturdy enough as advertised, its software easy to use, but the Customer Support site is a joke."
1,"So sad, quality bad","Can I give this no stars? I ignored the negative reviews and bought a Rio because it was compatible with downloads from my library's on line audio book site. When it did work it was great in every feature. When it didn't, customer support was non-existent and repair was expensive. After three refurbishings I give up. Don't waste your money."
1,Poor quality device,"I bought one of these for myself and the 256MB version for my wife. We both used them at the gym for about 3 months before both of them had issues. My wife's doesnt work unless she uses a full battery every couple of days...did the ""flash"" update and that still didn't help. Mine the volume sticks on high even though the volume switch isnt stuck. Got them at best buy but they no longer carry them (probably for a reason). These were supposed to be made for running / gym activity...but definately were not. Also, the earphones are a pain to work."
1,"Avoid, waste of money.","I purchase my Forge Rio in May of 2005. I worked fine for 3 months. I also added a 512 mb. secure media. All of a sudden, my Forge would play half the song and jump to the next song. I wiped out the internal memory and secure media and reloaded my mp3 files. A month later, it happen again. I e-mail tech support. They told me to flash the chipset. I told them I had the current rev. on the chipset. They wanted me to flash it anyway. I flashed it and lost all internal memory. All I had left was memory from my secure media. I sent them an e-mail. They agreed that it was defective. The warranty for new unit is 90 days. Reconditioned units is 30 days. When I tried to get it repaired out of warranty, I got the run around.Avoid purchasing all Rio products."
1,Originally Like It - But Not Anymore,"My first review of this product was very positive, although it felt kind of ""junky"" in ones hand. Over the last 45 days or so, the device has destroyed two of my Internal SD Cards (a 512 and a 1 Gig).This device appears to have serious problems with the internal card slot. Once the device is left without the battery for a half hour or so it starts working again, but the transfer of Audible Books or Music (really big files) locks up the system and then it won't turn on. And then you discover that the Internal SD Card is damaged.This wouldn't be such a big deal but I'm going to CHINA in FOUR DAYS. Now I need to buy a decent MP3 player for all the flying that this trip will include to, from and while in China. This has been a real pain!"
3,"Looks flashier, but still not as good as Cali","I got the Forge to replace my Cali because it is Audible compatible. Otherwise I probably would have used my Cali until it fell apart. The Forge isn't put together as well as the Cali, it seems cheaper and less sturdy. My biggest problem with the Forge is the carrying case. The carrying case for the Cali was great. I don't like using the armband, I prefer to carry it on my waist, but the Forge carrying case is basically designed to be used only with the armband, and doesn't work well on the wasteband at all. Mine fell off about two steps into my run. My advice is that if you have a Cali, forget the Forge, unless you have to have Audible content."
2,Run away!,"This player was great- for a month, when it stopped working. I followed all of the trouble shooting directions on the website, nothing worked. I contacted the company for a refund, and got a huge hassle and run around. I'm still trying to get my money back, and the player is still not working at all. It's also listed on msn reports as one of the worst players on the market. Look elsewhere- not at other Rio products- they do not stand behind their products and are masters of the bs run around. I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Getting Windows to recognize Rio Forge May drive you crazy,"I drove me nuts to get Windows XP Professional to recognize Rio Forge 512MB. I had to be on phone with tech support for about 20 minutes to fix this problem. It will work only if you plug the device in back USB port and also you must disconnect all other USB devices from your computer!!! In sense of good engineering, this is crazy. Obviously the design of flash card RIO is using needs to be improved. However, once you have spent your own money calling tech support (guess what RIO does not have a toll free support at all), then it works like a charm. The palyer is very good and worth it once you have jumped the hoops created by B+ grade computer interface design."
2,Should have bought an IPOD,"I purchased this MP3 player because of the expandable memory. Within 6 weeks the volume button broke and it is stuck on high.I contacted the company via email, phone and fax. I still do not have a response from them. If you want good customer service DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!"
4,great product,The Rio 512 gas good sound quality and is very durable. It is very simple to use. I would have given 5 stars but the earpieces are difficult to get used to.
1,AVOID!,"I'm currently on the 3rd Rio Forge in 2 months, all replaced by warrenty, and this one is about to also go back.First time the volume down button wouldn't work at all.Second time it would ruin any memory card put into the device. 3 memory cards later I found out it was the MP3 player (every problem was different, since the problems weren't consistent I assumed defects until the 3rd card). I'm currently RMAing a 1 GB SanDisk Ultra II card. 2 different cards have been replaced already.Now the device won't even turn on. I was trying to change the songs aorund on it and it, and it won't respond, turn on, or anything. Not with new batteries, not while plugged into USB...nothing. Thankfully the extrenal memory card survived.This MP3 player is great...but only when it works. When it goes down, it goes down hard. If you're going to get this, I recommend an extended warrenty."
1,Rio Forge - Don't Buy,I had the Cali and thought that this was a nicer upgrade. What a mistake. Problems from the first day (couldn't delete pre installed material and add new material) that required tech support - and they couldn't resolve it. I returned it and got the Cali which suits my needs. I would have given this a zero if that was an option.
1,Don't think twice about Rio,"I purchased a Rio mp3 player and it broke within a month. Fortunately, I was still under warranty. After many ""outsourced"" telephone conversations, they finally sent me a replacement. This model was ""refurbished"". I had purchased a new one and they replaced it with a refurbished one! That just doesn't seem right... After six months it stopped working all together.Please take heed to the poor reviews on this product... You'll be glad you did."
2,starter mp3 player,"I got this one as my first mp3 player kind of impulsivly at Wal-mart. I was happy with it at first, but later began to hate it. First off this player has almost no shock absorbtion so it turns off constantly when I run with it. very annoying. It does have a great user interface and is easy to change songs while running. The batterlife isn't great either, if you listen to music for long periods of time you should probabaly carry some extra batteries. the armband is somewhat comfortable and will help it not turn off so often. overall not a great player but for its price you cant expect too much"
3,AAC Playback???,"According to Fred Mertz in the previous review, the Rio Forge ""handles MP3s, WMAs, and iTunes AACs without incident"".According to Rio, this product does NOT handle AAC, proctected or unprotected. As far as I know, Panasonic was one of the few companies to have made a player that handled AAC."
1,PIECE OF JUNK - DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this Rio based on the product information on the Rio web site. Not only is the product cheap and fragile, but although it is advertised for sports, the clip/case does not even clip to running shorts or a water belt.Customer service at Rio was completely incompetent and unhelpful. I was shocked at the lack of service and inability to help me at all.Runners and other athletes - DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!Personally, I believe this product uses deceptive advertising. Now that I have read all the similar reviews to my experience, I realize that Rio customer service is really not helping anyone with this product."
1,Can not be recognized by my computer,"My computer (using winxp sp2) can not recognize it, taking it as an unknown device, and their tech support have no idea to fix it."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I puchased the Rio Forge 512 MP3 player because of it's small size and high storage capacity. Well, IT DOES NOT WORK!!! The transferred songs sound warped! I called customer service (waited for 30min. for them to answer) and they were not surprised to hear my problem. I am currently trying to fix the problem online and am downloading their ""firmware updates""...etc. This is very annoying considering i have not even used the product and I am already trying to fix a problem with it!!!!!!!!!"
5,THE BEST MUSIC PLAYER EVER!,"I didn't buy this MP3 player from Amazon, I bought it from Walmart. They have a $20.00 Mail-In rebate which makes the final price 156.97. This MP3 player is great for the younger crowd. You can record notes for school on the easy-accessable voice recorder, you can scan on the fm radio, or you can listen to the hottest music at your fingertips!"
1,Another unhappy rio buyer,"The item is advertised as a rugged sports item. But it is not. I had the same problem as many others, volume control button no longer works. Stuck on an uncomfortably high default volume. I bought this as a Christmas present so the 90 day warranty ended before there were 90 days of use by the gift recipient. Rio won't even respond and the on line seller (not amazon by the way) hasn't done anything either."
1,Great until it stops working,"I've had my Rio Forge 512 for 6 months now and I thought it was a great buy for the money until it started breaking down. I can no longer control the volume button (I'm stuck with the default volume), it locks up about 1/3 of the time, requiring me to reset the battery. The LCD is sometimes extremely difficult to read (especially in sunshine) .The warranty for the Rio Forge 512 is only 90 days. If you purchase this product I would definitely purchase the protection plan for it AND handle it very carefully."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER,"My first RIO Forge 512 lasted only 4 months before the volume button stopped working. After calling RIO, they agreed to send me another. Now, after another 3 months, the same thing happened again. The problem seems to be that the buttons are extremely fragile and break after just casual use....yet this is supposed to be a ""rugged"" SPORTS model?! RIO claims that it is not a design problem, and wanted me to pay $89.00 to have it rebuilt. No wonder they only offer a 90 day warranty. Sorry, I cannot afford to keep replacing my MP3 player every 3 or 4 months. Do a routine search on the internet about customer satisfaction with this unit, and you will find countless complaints that are similar. The unit is a piece of junk and is definitely not ready for prime time. Save your money and buy something else."
4,Good Little Gadget,"The first Rio Forge I got had a defect, but Amazon promptly replaced it. So far it has worked just fine. I've already filled it up with great tunes and it's nice to take jogging. I have had a little trouble with the sound quality though when I try to run it through a tape player in the car. Some of the songs are loud and some are soft. I would still recommend it though if you want to have several hours of music on hand, but you don't want to spend a fortune on an IPod."
2,Died After 1st Use,"This is a fairly solid unit and both software and controls are easy to use.The ""plug cover"" for the USB port will be lost within 5 minutes (terrible design) but not really needed anyway. The arm band clip is a terrible design and does not stay attached well. The ear-phones are fairly cheap.I probably would have rated this item 4 stars if it were not for the fact that after the 1st use, it quit working whenever I had a memory expansion card inserted. The Rio Tech Support seems to recognize this problem, but I could not get corrected so I had to return the item. Other than this flaw the unit functioned fine.The iPod mini is only slightly more expensive and a much, much better unit with considerably more memory. Cheers!"
3,READ THE FORUMS FIRST!,Before putting down some hard earned cash go to the rio forums at riovolution.com and rioworld.org to see if the this 512 unit has all the problems from the previous 128 & 256 Forge models fixed. There you will find informative and up to date posts about these issues and whether or not this is a good buy.The Forge line does offer some great features - that's probably why you're looking at it right? The biggest of which is the ability to put in a 1gb SD/MMC flash cards and vastly increase the memory capacity! This works for all Forge models.Good luck and READ UP.
2,"Three units, all had problems","First one lasted a few hours. Went dead. Sent back to rio, they replaced it. Second one would power off if you shook it, jarred it, or even breathed on it too hard. Sent it back, they accidentally sent me a new one and ""repaired"" mine.My repaired one will still power off it you tap it in the wrong way. Even if it is in your pocket and you brush someone. The new unit is better, but it will still power off occasionally if bumped.I will not possibly buy another rio. I had an old Rio 500 that I was replacing that developed similar problems.. although after years."
5,#1 comic! If you find it - keep it!,"This is the legendary Deadbone Erotica by Vaughn Bode! There are other reprints of various complilations, but this is the rarest of the rare! Once I was gullible enough to swap this for a couple of hip hop records - one of a string of mistakes back in my teens (like getting into graffiti in the first place, which was far more trouble than it was worth)! Never again. I'm looking out for another copy like a hawk, probably more chance if I lived in U.S.A., rather than Australia, but you never know your ""luck"".The pencil drawings are immaculate and well captured in the printing. The cover is in colour, while the interior is black and white.It is fairly thick, with lots of stories. It probably was great value - back in the 1970s.Cobalt 60 by Mark Bode doesn't even come close to the original mastery of his father. Sorry Mark."
5,Clearly written and refreshing!,"This book cuts through all of the garbage surrounding the ""scary"" topic of the devil and magic. It is practical in that it provides you with the working tools to create a pact yourself and explains to you the reasons that it may be in the best interest of your psychological health to do such a thing!"
3,better the devil that's new,"We enjoyed the first half of this book...dear magicians,... that had some very clever and thoughtful observations by Jason S. Black, however, the second half was merely a rehash of stuff from old grimoires and, we expect, simply put in there to fatten the book (how devilish of them). Our endorsement is not an enthusiastic one, but still there is some interesting ideas contained within.kyela,the silver elves"
1,Rude Awakening,"Anyone that buys this book is Wasting their time and money. The old days are over when Demons were commanded by people using xian god names to make pacts.Today if anyone tries to make a pact will get a rude awakening. Pacts are disrespectful to the Demons, plus you are commanding them in the xian god's name. I warn anyone who buys this book..Don't Buy It, and try to command any Demon mentioned in this book. You will So Regret it."
1,Dont Be a Idiot,"Please dont be a idiot, You really think you can command a Demon, and he will listen ? They are Farmore Powerful that you ever will be, go ahead, try and command one, the only thing you will succeed in is Getting your Self possesed, and loseing control of your body.true you might be granted a demons power for a while, till he destroys your body that it is...... Demons are not the only way to power.Demons are Being's with out bodys, they lust for a body to inhabit, Given the chance they will Take one, Dont give them that chance, unless that is, you want to give your body over to a psychotic and vengeful demon, once he has your body he will not respect it very much, try and gain your body back and he will destroy it. Its not very difficult to be possesed, Just be willing or Do some stupid incantation and summon some demon, and voila, your done, Have fun In hell !!PS gave it one star cus i cant give it 0"
3,Work station only.,"This is a perfectly acceptable workstation, to be used on a home or office network connected to a server. As a stand-alone, it is too limited in every way to be useful."
2,Disappointed,"I am an Activity Director for an independent/assisted community and we offer exercise 7 days a week here in order to help our residents sustain their agility, mobility and achieve a better quality of life. I rely on alternating instructor taught classes and DVD's. I was really looking forward to the You Can Get a Workout Sitting down DVD. Unfortunately, my residents (almost all of them) could not hear the instructor over the music; even I found it to be difficult. The exercises themselves were good and my rating may seem harsh but when a DVD is targeted toward a certain population the makers of the DVD really need to ensure these issues don't occur."

3,"nice, but very stiff","very attractive, great functionality in clasp and adjustment buckle, but horribly stiff.I was unable to use it, too uncomfortable for cat."
3,Deja-vu,"I loved the story the first time it was published.Mr Goddard must be into the recycle program, asthe novel ""Digger"" appears to have been recycled into ""Cheaters"". In fact, the first couple of pages are taken exactly word for word from his earlier novel.It will be a most interesting experience to finish reading ""Cheaters"" to find out how much of the story has been recycled."
1,homeowner,The Gloves were poor quality. Holes burned through the finger tips within 2 weeks of use. Other simular gloves would last 1 - 2 years.
2,Need duct tape,"These are cheap gloves. They got several burn holes after a couple weeks of medium use but nothing that a little duct tape couldn't temporarily cure. I'm still using the gloves after a couple of years but only because I kept repairing with more duct tape - they're actually more tape than leather or insulate now. I should have bought new ones long ago and probably could buy a better pair for the amount of tape I've used to repair these but I guess I don't think about that when I'm stoking the fire. I wouldn't recommend these gloves nor buy them again, but I've used them for a couple of years so they got 2 stars instead of one."
3,does the job,bought this to keep from burning my hands when putting wood into my wood stove. product does what i needed
2,Different color,"The article of the color completely different from an image sample reached.It is the order to which the actual thing was surprised at brown although the image was gray.An exhibitor needs to keep in mind using it as it is, since there is no inconvenience in practical use."
4,Jinnie Ghost by Berlie Doherty and Jane Ray,"Just in time for Halloween, the prolific team of Berlie Doherty and Jane Ray offer a lyrical ghost story. Jinnie Ghost, ""thin as the wind,"" sweeps from house to house causing the strange night noises and other phenomena known so well by children. The children see her, but Jinnie Ghost ""doesn't turn her head"" if she hears them. As she flits through sleeping children's rooms, each child has a fantastic flight of imagination.Doherty's poetical text are a perfect match with Ray's eerie nighttime illustrations. However, Jinnie Ghost is hauntingly real and may be too frightening for toddlers and some preschoolers despite the gentle text. For children wanting some slight shivers, this is a recommended read."
1,Pass on this one,"I rarely write reviews but I was compelled to do so with this book. We checked this out of the library (so glad I didn't pay for it) for my 5 year old - he selected it b/c he liked the illustrations. It is not only frightening for a 5 year old but it doesn't make any sense! It's almost as if the author just threw a bunch of random words on a page. With so many good children's books out there, I strongly recommend you pass on this one. Check out any book by Chris Van Dusen. His books are a joy to read and the children LOVE them."
2,Not enough detail!!!,"Although Wilderness Basics covers the essential topics regarding roughing it in the outdoors, it lacks sufficient detail for novice campers. The authors should have added more depth to the gear section, particularly about tents. Furthermore, they failed to adequately discuss weatherproofing for tents, a definite basic for me! There are some topics that are informative, and campers should know them, but I was looking for a book to keep in my pack for reference. This book was not it. Happy travels!"
3,Anne Ducros,"I bought this CD mostly for the instrumental parts. I had heard ""Green Dolphin Street"" on KKJZ and really liked what the drummer was doing.There are some very good standards on this record. Anne Ducros is a French Jazz vocalist and does some neat things. I felt there was a bit of a language problem here and there (for instance the bridge of ""I fall in Love too easily.)All in all it's a nice CD."
1,don't no,"Hallo, I ordered and payed this 2 Audio CD's at 10. of December 2007 with my credit card but never hold the CD's in my hands!Where are this two's CD's???Can you check the way.

5,Love these boots,"Naturalizer Women's Snug BootThey fit perfectly. I was looking for a double-wide shoe and was nervous that they'd actually be wide enough. They arrived and they're great. They're warm and practical as well as looking professional, so that I can wear them during the workday."
5,Worth Every Penny,Anyone interested in the way a cold-blooded killer's mind works will be fascinated by this DVD. I got shivers watching it. Product arrived in mint condition and before the seller stated it would. I would definitely buy again from this seller.
3,Interesting Iceman,"This DVD gives a three dimensional view of the ""iceman"" it furnishes and rounds out the book by Phil Carlo.Gives a face and a voice to the image created by ones imagination.Well worth the money if the book holds you as interested as it did me."
4,creepy,This guy is crazy. has no morals or regret. good movie if you are in to this style.It gives you some insight into his mind.
5,The world of a contract killer for the mob!!,"I had seen this on HBO years ago, but I just had to get it again to see it. Riveting and chilling how Kaklinski talks about killing like ordering a cup of coffee at your local Starbucks. He really is a classic case of a sociopath. This is a must watch!!"
3,The Iceman talketh,"The videos were entertaining and interesting, but there was much repetition among the segments and they seemed shorter than the announced running time."
4,Chilling and Compelling.,"Having seen the original airing of all three documentaries on HBO, I was both surprised and thrilled that they were combined and available on DVD.The interviews with Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski, both a professional killer and sadistic psychopath, were more chilling than any horror film I have ever seen.His ability to balance his extraordinarily long career as a ruthless and highly creative murderer for hire, while leading an apparently ""normal"" life as a father and husband living in a typical middle class suburb, dissected in great detail in the book ""The Iceman, Confessions Of A Mafia Contract Killer"", is what made his story all the more compelling.This isn't for everyone but it is a must see for anyone who wants an insight into the mind of a man who could only mimic being human."
2,The Iceman Confessions of a Mafia Hitman & The Iceman Interviews,I had purchased the set and they are both exactly the same interview just different titles-no need to say I'm not happy about that-and that's the reason my rating is a 2. My feelings on the inteviews? It's very frightening to think that he could have done all that he did without batting an eyelash or sweat! Totally mind boggling to say the least.
4,Worth Watching,"If you like documentaries this is worth watching. It was worth the money i spent on it. It is a good movie also, if you like anything to do with the mophia."
3,Oh Come on Now!,"Seriously, if some perverted studio is going to put the Paris Hilton sex tape on DVD or the Pam and Tommy, then what the hell is the problem with putting this on DVD? You can find ANYTHING on DVD these days. . .I just bought Saved by the Bell the other day. Catching my drift??"
4,2012 and still no DVD?,"Seriously? One of the seminal documents of the punk era, a rare opportunity to see these bands playing live and this DVD is unavailable? Unconsciounable."
5,PUNKS FOR PROFIT,"Yea I have waited for this title to be released on DVD since DVDS were invented, and I probably havent seen the actual movie in 25 years. All youz scumbags that sell the ripped bootleg for hundreds of dollars can shtuff it buddy, get off the intermutt and go spin some of yer greenday records its over with bye bye. Penelope whats the hold up?"
2,Nothing matters--on Speed,"This film captures the high-energy nihilism of punk. One scene shows punkers joking about posing for photographs with a corpse. Life and death are meaningless, supposedly.But we cannot live this out consistently. We know better in our better moments. Eternity is in our hearts.That is the decline of western civilization. Can it ascend?"
4,Its time for Decline,"I dont really understand why this isnt out on DVD. This documentary is so great, I remember first seeing that movie and thinking it was the greatest thing that had ever slipped hard and fast into my VHS. I was lucky to see it because NOBODY returned that tape when they rented it, so you had to track down whoever stole it from one of the few video stores that previously had it. Thats how good this documentary is! So if and WHEN it comes out on DVD which I hope it does, GRAB IT AND GRAB IT FAST! Because trying to rent it on DVD will be just like trying to rent it on VHS!"
2,Jiggling lid.,"The tea pot itself is very pretty. The problem with it is that the lid doesn't quite fit right. It jiggles on the pot and has to be pushed down hard to seat it, then it still jiggles. If I had found it in this condition in a department store I never would have made the purchase. It definitly is a second, like what you might find in a discount store but at least then you expect these kind of imperfections. The reason I didn't return it is because of the trouble of mailing it out and it is still a very pretty peice, I work 8AM to 6PM with a very short break usually if any."
2,34 ounce Teapot,Item arrived broken because it was poorly packed. In addition the floral design that I received was different to that shown on the website.
4,same as described,"same as described, but we didn't use it so far. My wife really wants to buy this one very much."
1,Not Impressed,"I purchased this thinking it would be a fine, precise line. It's very hard to get a fine line. It's either to weak or splatters. I didn't want a chalk line that's too fussy. I rather stick with chalk."
2,snapline critique,"I am not impressed with this item. The snapline has leaked from day one. The line is hard to see. It does not rewind well. On a positive note, the string used is very thin, so it could conceivably put out a very thin line."
1,Ink line,Bought this item with the wet condition ink thinking it woulding be my solution to doing lay out in damp conditions. WOW was I wrong!! DID NOT even snap a single line ever no matter what I tried. The 25 foot reach is really quite the pain also when you are trying to lay out a large building. Save the head ache and do not buy.
3,Nice tool,"This works well for marking out on non-porous surfaces such as steel, glass, aluminum. If you plan on using it for plywood, don't bother, the ink barely shows you. You are better off with chalk for wood, Tajima's chalk line is a bit delicate feeling and a bit larger than common found chalk lines, the auto rewind rocks. This ink line is great on steel studs. Be safe, work hard, don't pollute."
4,Fast Racin',"This new game is really cool. It's like being in a real stock car. It goes extremely fast. There is never a dull moment. It makes real sounds, real 3d realistic accidents and real al strength against the best drivers.There are real manufactures all 2002 teams. Great Paint shop where you can design cars and your pit crew uniforms. This game is extremely fast so, fasten your seatbelt to your computer chair."
2,Don't try to run a season,"It is impossible to run a season as the short tracks screw up the pitting in every race. Graphics are great, but there are some real issues with this game."
3,A truncated edition of a great book.,"This book is truncated edition of the Walrus and the Warwolf. Although the complete book is excellent (5 stars), do not buy this edition. For some reason the publishers cut the book and half. The story is chopped off and this book ends practically in mid-sentence. The second part was never published on its own, so skip this book and just buy the Walrus and the Warwolf (which Amazon appears to carry)."
3,Another apostate,"The late Chogyam Trungpa has already been picked over by his former students and lovers (most of them his students). All one is left with at the end of the saga is the essential problem Tibetan Buddhism presents to westerners. It is a religion with a monocratic heirarachy that stresses unflinching obedience to the ""teacher"", who is supposed to embody the Buddhist teachings. Trouble is it is now exported without reform to a democratic west. It is fascinating to see how students manage this tension in their own lives. As charismatic an brilliant as he apparently was, Trungpa was an alcoholic philanderer with some sociopathic tendencies as well. Most of his students came through unscathed. Others, like Butterfield, did not. Read it and weep."
2,Update Problems,I am not sure how well this product works. I installed it on an HP running XP SP2. Updates no longer work. The software informs me that an update is available and I select update. Nothing happens after that. I have tried turning off the firewalls (Both Microsoft and Norton) to no avail. I will remove it and try it on 2000 Pro.
2,You Can do Better,"I purchased this product having used the McAfee Firewall and Virus software. PC Magazine was correct, McAfee AntiSpyware does not catch many of the latest viruses and the current list is not as large as other products. I bought the first version of this online in March of last year and the 2005 update later. McAfee cut off my online updates in March of this year even though I had installed a later version in October!! I uninstalled this and went for WebRoot Spysweeper. On first scan there were 84 ad cookies! When updating current software or downloading new items, WebRoot steps in immediately to ask about the scripts running. Don't waste your time with McAfee!"
1,big mistake,"The automatic update feature of this software never worked properly on my Windows XP machine. After a frustrating and fruitless exchange of emails with the McAfee technical support staff (with whom you cannot speak, unless you pay a fee) I decided to un-install and return the AntiSpyware. Amazon.com very graciously agreed to take the software back, although Amazon is not really to blame."
4,Mendelssohn's Complete Choral Works,"This is an excellent collection of many unknown and rarely performed Mendelssohn choral works with orchestra. Both choir and orch have a beautiful tone and are sung with fine soloists,great ensemble and sensitivity ot the score. * * * * * Five Stars. Ron Houser"
2,It came upon a midnight Clear,"I feel that this movie needs to come to DVD as all the other movies have because I am building my Christmaslibrary of all the GOOD christmas movies for my family to enjoy in the coming years.KarlOzark, MO"
5,What is the problem?,"How sad that such a wonderful movie should be so hard to find, or that you would have to pay up to $99.00 for a used VHS in order to be able to bring enjoyment to your home at Christmas time, I debate paying this every year I go online to see if it has been released. There is a Mickey Rooney Website that takes feedback and I wrote strong comments about them releasing this movie again. I don't know what it can do, but maybe something. If I hear anything positive from that I will email you all that love this movie as much as me. Happy Holidays!"
5,PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE,"My mother and I both love this movie and wish it would either air again on TV, or come out for purchase on DVD. It is a sweet Christmas movie that brings the real meaning of Christmas to light. Mickey Rooney is great in it! I just wish it was available again!!!"
1,Sound was horrible.,"It is too bad this movie hasn't been remastered and put on DVD. The sound was horrible and sometimes there was no sound at all. I realize this is a product of age, but perhaps this movie shouldn't be marketed in its current form."
2,"Same ol', same ol'.","I was hoping this Cuisinart garlic press would be an improvement on the antique we were using, but it isn't. It squashes cloves, which then seem to squirt here and there with very little passing through the holes. Forget mousetraps, the world will be a path to your door if you invent a better garlic press!"
1,it sucks,this product looks cool but it is not. it does not work and is very very hard to build winding the coil was very hard and hooking it up was hard plus it is not good quality its a toilet paper roll and a thin plastic breakable base. please listen to me do not buy it it does not work it is a piece of junk.
3,How to wind the coil,"I haven't purchased this item so I gave is a dead center rating. I used to wind a lot of coil as a kid: radios, Tesla coils, etc., back in the day long before Nintendo. The trick to do it is an old one that goes back to the earliest days of radio:1. Get your wire and a cardboard (or whatever) tube to wind it around.2. Get a candle or other chunk of wax and a tiny pot to melt it in.3. Get a brush.4. Melt the wax.5. Use the brush to paint the tube with the molten wax.6. Wind the wire around the tube after the wax hardens.That should solve your problem. It might help to wear late 19th to early 20th cent. clothing when you do this, but that's probably just going overboard. If you already dress Goth or Steampunk, that's good enough."
1,"Just as everyone else said, this thing is junk!","25 years ago I made a crystal radio from a kit similar to this one except back then it worked. This kit is so poorly produced, it's pathetic. The ends of the wires were stripped less than 1/4"" which made them extremely difficult to work with, and the wire gauge is so thin that if you try to strip the wires to expose more copper, they break! The box says ""Age 8 and Up"" which is 100% nonsense. My 13 year-old daughter and I spent over an hour assembling this and there is NO WAY she could have done it herself. Then we spent another hour troubleshooting and trying to get a signal. Nothing worked. The next day I handed it over to a friend that has been repairing and installing aircraft radios since the 70's. He couldn't even make this thing work so if that's not a testament to what a piece of junk this is, I don't know what is. GARBAGE!"
3,Wrong detector diode included with the kit.,"I was very excited to build my own crystal radio so I purchased this kit. I have about 10 years experience in the electronics industry so I figure it would be a snap! I carefully followed the instuctions and wound the tuning coil as described in the instuctions and hooked up the wiring correctly. I found a suitable antenna, the steam pipes in my house but I couldn't get any stations not even backgroud noise. Then I examined the detector diode, it was an ordinary silicon switching diode. The diode looked like a 1N914. I won't get into the technical aspects except to say that a silicon diode is not ""sensitive"" enough to ""detect"" the radio signal unless you were right under the radio tower. I replaced the silicon diode with a germanium 1N35 diode, which is more ""sensitive"", and tuned into several radio stations!This kit would be great if it came with a germanium detector diode."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"My Daughter received this for Christmas, and we put it together yesterday. This kit is not worth the money, and not worth the time wasted assembling it.The earlier critical reviews are correct: winding the coil is not easy, and the bolt-washer-nut wire connections are maddeningly frustrating to put together. I'll add that the instructions are poorly written and hard to follow, and have more than a few glaring errors. We haven't got ours to work yet - I suspect it may be because the diode is pointing the wrong way. The instructions point out that diodes only conduct electricity one direction, yet the instructions don't specify how to orient it when it's hooked up.If you deter your child from electronics, this might work - it takes what could be a fun project, makes it frustrating and ends in failure. I've heard that Snap Circuits are fun - I might try those next...."
1,NOT age appropriate,I thought this would be a fun summer afternoon project for my 8 year old. He is excited about Cub Scouts and this is one of the electives for the Bear year. We were extremely frustrated with how little he could actually do and how much *I* had to do. He ended up enjoying the ear piece and we put the project away for another day. I believe we will skip this elective and work on something else entirely. Even more frustrating is the fact that I actually purchased the item at our Cub Scout store rather than ordering it online... almost as if BSA is endorsing a really poorly constructed product.Save yourself and you child the frustration and find a better way to spend time together.
1,Not a real crystal radio,"A real crystal radio uses a ""crystal"" instead of a diode. You are supposed to put a pin on the crystal which does the job of a diode. This one uses a regular diode which sort of defeats the purpose. In addition it is cheaply build. It is flimsy and basically a piece of junk. If you got nothing better to do I suppose you may spend the day wrapping the wire."
3,Never Again,"The Crystal Radio Kit that I ordered is great. It came from Best Service Store. Ha Ha Ha That's not the right name for them. My product was ordered on July 29, 2011, it was lost. I had to contact to store, they did ship it out, but they ship the wrong item. I did finally receive the right item August 28, 2011 almost a month later. I needed this item for a class and this company caused me to lose point off my grade. I would order this product again just not from this store."
2,no Selectivity,Definitely not for young kids. winding the coil requires lots of patience and attention to detail to get it wound properly. Once hooked up we could only get one station no matter how we tuned the coil. That was frustrating be cause it was in spanish and none of speaks that. Flimsy materials of construction.
5,Great Shipping/Product!,"I bought this book for class. I am surprised how fast it came. Also, it came in perfect condition (I bought it used) but it looks great!"
4,A more forgiving review,"One review wrote that Matthews ignored recent sociological literature on the prophets. Maybe he did, but I'm not sure that's the point. As an experienced teacher sensitive to the needs of students what he furnishes is basic relatively noncontroversial information from which to depart if one desired to go deeper. The point is not to confuse the student (in this case, clearly the beginning student is the target) with what's trendiest in never-ending scholarly debates.That said, Matthews is very, extremely readable and can be finished in two or three leisurely sittings. He treats the prophets in their historical chronological order, not their canonical order, which is better for the overall flow of the book. He presents the meaning and message of the prophets in historical background with appreciation for their diverse literary personalities. I have much respect for Matthews as an instructor and recommend anything he has published."
5,An easy to read and insightful overview of IT Governance,An excellent summary and insightful overview on IT Governance. This is an easy read emphasizing its principles with many real world examples and case studies. Well suited for senior leadership as well as IT operational management. The provided frameworks can be utilized to support internal IT Governance projects or to augment external expertise. Sets a solid foundation for more detailed studies and implementation projects specific to your organization.
4,Reviewing IT Governance,"An excellent mixture of theory and real case studies put together for better understanding of governance. I have tried to map this as an architect view point and tried to get answers to my solutions coming out of each decision making point. The questions for each five category is being nicely put together. Even if governance seems a broad area, but after going through this you can actually think of subtle directions what decision to be made and who would do that and how you monitor them for each department (ie division) in IT organization. The architechtural diagrams are impressive in order to provide complete clarity on the topic being discussed."
5,Good research on an Important Topic,IT governance is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have practice. This is especially the case in fast moving IT environment with applications in flux and the infrastructure being transformed by Open Source.This book presents interesting insights based on a study of 250 enterprises worldwide. The authors illustrate what should be obvious that firms that have disciplined processes do better than those that don't.
2,Very boring,"I bought this book based on the good reviews it had received. I could not find any useful infomraiton in this book and the Author seems to go to such great lengths trying to explain governance, but in a very rigid style.If you are one of those people who have great memory and like to show off by throwing a lot of big nice buzz words, this book is for you. If you would like to really understand governance in a nutshell, I suggest you go elsewhere."
2,Wears thin,"The first Groucho/detective novel was only so-so, and this second attempt is not as good. It wears a little thin, the mindless wisecracks. The Groucho persona of the Marx Brothers movies was certainly zany, but there was no serious jeopardy implied. It just doesn't work, somehow, in a detective novel, no matter how hard Mr. Goulart tries."
2,Not for the price.....,"Around the holidays I bought this for four dollars....it is also sold in stop and shop for five dollars.....It is a very hard toy that does not do anything....it will not even stand in it's little toy it comes with. It has the same repetitive song. I bought two of these and my one year old daughter never gave them a second look...at four dollars for a cute figure toy if your child is REALLY into backyardagins otherwise ten dollars NO, they really don't LOVE them, NO!"
5,A cute Hello Kitty book made by Sanrio,"This book is for preschool age children. Hello Kitty dreams that she is Santa Claus, and she does all the things Santa Claus does during Christmas time. When she wakes up from her dream she is surprised to see her very own Christmas tree with presents. The colors are very bright, and this book is a nice little holiday book. I recommend this book to parents of young children."
4,Terrific fact in fiction for any wannabe writer!,"A real page turner with memorable characters. A new writer seems to have no chance with the shrinking publishing giants, and Goldsmith, an advocate of new writers, dishes the dirt on the industry. Makes one want to toss their manuscript in the trash!"
3,Good but not Great,"Olivia Goldsmith is good, she's even great most of the time. This book does not live up to The First Wives Club or Flavor of The Month or even Marrying Mom. It is OK, and you can get through it easily, but it's not an all-nighter."
2,Bestseller?,"I have read several of the authors other works, (Bad Boy, Young Wives, etc)and enjoyed them much more. The characters were introduced so briefly it took half the book to get a feel for them. I was halfway through the book before I realized I didn't really care for it, which made me think I probably should finish it. It was all rather predictable, and the ending was no surprise (Of course a happily-ever-after for the author of the Bestseller) Everyone who ever thought they could write the Great American Novel (myself included) would likely throw in the towel after reading this novel. If this book has any message to impart, it is that publishing is not about good writing. The only amusing parts were the little in-jokes referring to characters from First Wives, Flavor of the Month, etc. If you want to read all of this authors books, go ahead and read this, but if you are new to her works, try Young Wives or First Wives Club, and you won't be disappointed."
1,A chore to read,"This book rambled on and on in many parts, providing the reader with many nonessential details. On the plus side, the character of Pam Mantiss provided much needed comic relief, causing me to laugh out loud at some of her wisecracks. But alas, such comic moments were few and far between and even the invincible Pam Mantiss couldn't save this book. I enjoyed having my wisdom teeth extracted much more than I enjoyed reading this book. Do NOT read this book on your lunch breaks at work -- it's guaranteed to put you to sleep!"
4,"True, trashy tale of trials & tribulations of publishing","No other beach book offers you an inside look on publishing as THE BESTSELLER does. Tyrannical editors in the no holds barred, rat race to propel their book to number one; writers struggling to publish their truth as they see it. Each page gossips about each character with vivid, lurid detail. You'll especially adore this one if you've been entrapped in the working world of publishing -- it's more than a jungle out there"
5,An Inside Look at the Publishing World,"I love to read but never knew what would happen if I tried to get a book published. This book gives you an inside look at what goes on in the publishing world from the writing of the book, the trying to get someone to read it problem, to getting a good spot at the ABA convention. The problems of the different authors trying to get their books published seems so real that I wonder if each story has not happened to someone real! I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in how the book they're reading actually ends up in a bookstore"
5,Outstanding! Loved every bit of this book,"This book was fantastic from beginning to end. It was long, but I wish it were even longer. The characters were well developed. The story was funny with great pacing.This novel was more or less a look into the publishing world and the things new authors have to go through to get published. It really criticizes the industry for how hard they make it for new authors. Lots of name dropping and you wonder if some of the people the author mentions are really the way she describes.All in all, a great read."
4,poignant moments,"I was hoping this book would be as fuuny as ""Marrying Mom"", but it was much more serious. I enjoyed reading it although I was offended that the two main ""really bad guys"" were Jewish. Pam didn't seem believable- she was too obnoxious and evil to be real. I found the story of the mother who lost her daughter especially touching."
2,A Bestseller It Ain't!!,"I picked this book up in the airport in Detroit in preparation for a 3 hour layover, and it did pass the time. The first part of the book is fascinating as Ms Goldsmith delineates her many characters, and introduces us to the seedy business of book publishing. But I found, as I left the book, then came back to start a new chapter, that I couldn't remember which character was which without a program. Not a good sign. But it got worse. None of her many characters came alive except perhaps the scheming Pam Mantiss. Her ""good"" characters were too good, and her ""bad"" characters were ridiculous! As for the ending, so very predictable. All the honest, hardworking writers' books did well and all the tarnished characters got their comeuppance. Just like real life"
1,Horrible - Do not buy,"This must be the most horrible DVD ever made. The quality sucks, it is worse than a copy made with a camera in a theater. It has nothing to do with the tiles and advertisement. It is as erotic as watch paint dry. If you buy, you will regret as I did. I felt I was cheated. It only got 1 star because the system does not allow zero stars."
4,A book for someone even if they are not a hockey player.,The book is not about hockey it is about someone's mental journey. Well I read the book because we were required to for school. Travis went to Tabor Academy where i am currently being educated. We read it over summer vaction. He then came and spoke in the fall to us. So for anyone who wants to know how he's doing read this. He is very confidant that he will walk again. He thinks that technology will let him. He has more mobility that I thought he would have in his right arm. He looks good and recently the new hockey rink was dedicated to him where he also spoke. I even got the oppertunity to speak with him. Great person and i think it is amazing he was able to live with what happened to him.
4,hockey,"This is the best book I've read in a long time about a hockey player. I could some what compair to him, bacause I play hockey not in boston but Minnesota. I played a team that very well coached and in showed when we went to state for class A. But before that in the playoffs, I went into the boards at full speed when the player from the other team tripped me. I didn't get serious hurt, but I though of my friend when he went into the boards and had back problems so he couldn't play hockey again. Thats what I felt when I went into the boards, but thankfull that I didn't get seriously hurt like Travis did."
3,Eleven Seconds,"Overall I was pleased with this item, my only disappointment was that it was being sold as ""new"" but it had water damage or something on the top of the pages."
2,Poor writing marred an otherwise possibly interesting book,"This book had a lot of potential. It is marred by some of the worst writing I've ever read. It sounded like Travis's own thoughts. I did not want to sit through a 2 hour lecture with Travis, wich is what the book is. I've met Travis, and he is a very nice fellow, but the book should have had a lot more editing done.So, if your interested in a two hour lecture, read this book."
2,"Average book,","I thought the book provided some good experiences that you might encounter being a quad. I feel that this book can be missleading to other quads. What travis goes threw is not the same for everybody who is a quad. There are Quads who are able to walk after years of hard work in therapy, and to me that would be a book I would want to read if I was a quad. A story about a person who beat the odds of being a quad. I have meet a few and was amazed in how they did it. Their stories were truly uplifting."
1,Eleven Seconds,"I would love to review this product, however, it is now well over a month and I have yet to recieve it. I would love to know where it is and why it is taking so long. I ordered it on June 12 and my credit card was billed that day but I have not yet recieved the product. I am very disappointed."
4,Great book to teach kids that winning isn't everything.,"Brought new perspective to my kid's life. He learned to enjoy the game, regardless of how poorly he played. I think this a great book for people/kids that have difficutly accepting defeat."
5,11 Seconds,"This book was extrememly touching to me and to everyone I know who has read it. It goes into detail about how a young boys dream turns into a nightmare but he overcomes it with a great attitude and the will to go on. I recommend this book to anyone with a dream, who has had there dreams shattered or for anyone who loves hockey. One of the best books i've ever read or bought!"
3,Not what I thought,"Basically the book is the same as it was 25 years ago, but with a new introduction. It was a bit repetative, and there was a lot of theory in it. I would have liked to hear more examples of how not to hurry your kids, and bad examples of hurrying. I didn't really find that. If you buy a used version of the original book, I think you'll get the same information. I wasn't very inspired or helped by the book."
1,Don't waste your time.,This book was very repetative. I think the whole book could have been written in twenty pages. I felt that a lot of the book was common sense and didn't give any practical advice. I felt like I was just reading a research paper.
3,Tosca,"Very early in the story Morse is riding on a train, half nodded off, dreaming of ""Tosca"" the opera he has just attended at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Much later in the plot this same performance furnishes a vital clue toward the solution of the case along with a train ticket. We meet Amanda Hillwood as Dr. Grayling Russell, a pathologist, filling in for Max - who has suffered a minor stroke. We are also exposed to a possible suicide, a definite murder, blackmail, adultery as well as the theft of valuable paintings including nudes. Most of the action takes place in and about the grounds of the sumptuous home of Dr. and Mrs. Julius Hanbury. Along with Dr. Charles Hudson, Hanbury is seeking the post of Master of Courtney College at Oxford - which adds another wrinkle to our mystery. Patricia Hodge as Lady Hanbury contributes an excellent performance. I rated this episode three stars, but after another viewing I must move it to four."
1,This Product wasn't that good,"I bought this product to help clean the air of odors in my room,but unfortunately, it didn't live up to it's name. It did a poor job."
5,Did Jesus come back to life?,"Ken Hensley is definitively at his enthusisatic best in this audio talk (3 CDs). He puts forward solid arguments based on the eye witnesses of the time which together construct a fairly irrefutable proof of the resurrection event. To do this he utilizes different approaches, such as how psychologically it does not make any sense for the first christians from so many different backgrounds to maintain they had seen the risen Jesus ""en masse"" or individually whilst under the threat of torture and death to recant, unless this were actualy true.Well worth listening to it. I'm about to do so for the third time!Resurrection Apologetics"
2,Fonda has been better.,"An early Fonda Film set in North Africa during WWII. Hank plays one of severalBritish Tommys fighting the nasty nazis. It is an interesting mixture ofblatent flag waiving (that is not a bad thing) typical B grade propagandaeffort (that is a bad thing) and Mr. Fonda trying hard but not quite succeding, toput fortha performance the equal of his co-stars. I liked the film mainly becauseit is a classic example of WWII propaganda. Could have taken place in the AmericanSouth West in the 1870's with Fonda fighting the Apaches over a water hole.If you have little expectation of an Oscar Winning effort you will not be disapointed.But it is worth the watch. WH"
4,magick or misdirection?,"At first listening, I was immediately struck by the timber and quality of the vocals, very dynamic! the overall production is careful, without being over produced, and the lyrics, while genuinely heartfelt , are never to 'precious'."
5,Jump me fragrance....,"Guys, this is a great scent if you want your woman to go nuts. I can't keep my hands off my man when he wears it. I practically melt into him when I smell it."
2,Not So Much,"I got Issey for my husband for Christmas after a coworker told me about how wonderful it smelled on one of her ex's. Although at first, it smelled ok, it got worse with time. Thankfully, the scent only lasted an hour on him. I agree totally with the guy that said it smells more like lemon Pledge! I'll save my $50 next time!!!"
5,MMMMMMMM,"I can't say that this many women have ever agreed to smell me at one time in my whole life. The scent is magical. It actually makes me happy to wear it. My car smells sexy, and women notice when I walk by. It doesn't take much, either. Just a dab.If you want to smell great, buy it."
5,Class Book,We used this book in my sociology class. I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise. Interesting book though. More interesting than most class readings.
1,Where is Full Length Fanfare?????,Most of what is here is ok but how can they NOT include the full length version of Fanfare For The Common Man and include garbage like Bitches Crystal and Jeremy Bender/Sheriff?? Criminal!!!!!
3,Good old music never dies,"This particular collection had some songs I had never heard. Mostly remembered ELP for the ""lucky Man""cut, but some of the other items played well, like ""Jerusalem"". You might have heard that one in themovie ""Chariots of Fire"", in a slightly different version by another artist. Something I would buy again."
2,out-dated high concept,"Having only heard the pop hits on the radio before, I bought this collection, seeking out a favorite like BLACK MOON in particular, to find the 2-CD collection is mainly screechy whiney instrumentals that are faux jazz and badly conceived and executed. A friend advised me ELP was in the category of ART ROCK, along with ELO, which is another band that hasn't fared well over time. If you like high-pitched instrumentals, this collection is for you, but if you don't like instrumentals of the high-pitched or standard variety, skip this. If you're looking for their few pop hits, which are well-done, even if the lyrics are pretentious - and this trio exhibits a truly schizoid personality, in their pop realizations vs the jazz - it would be better to find anthology collections which include the song or songs you're looking for or buy one of their individual CDs."
3,Be Careful!,"They used the wrong version of ""Jerusalem."" It's the same bizarro remix with extra percussion and a different lead vocal from Greg that Sanctuary used on their reissue of ""Brain Salad Surgery."" Same with ""Toccata,"" ""Still You Turn Me On, and ""Karn Evil 9 First Impression."" Hopefully, once Shout! Factory reissues the full ELP catalog, they'll use the correct masters."
4,Best Comp Thus Far Except For...,"As previously noted, the usage of the wrong masters on the ""Brain Salad Surgery"" material. Oy vey. Also, ""Fanfare For the Common Man"" was butchered during the edit. If the lackluster ""Canario"" had been cut, the full ""Fanfare"" could have been squeezed in.Additionally, the booklet's essay completely overlooks Emerson and Lake's short-lived trio with Cozy Powell, as well as the group ""3"", which Emerson and Palmer formed with Robert Berry for an even briefer period.Otherwise, the music is magnificent. Of course."
1,Bad remastering,"Warning! Do not buy this new ""remastering"" unless you really want this particular collection! They've botched the job and the audio is worse than any of the previous releases. I'm seriously disappointed in Shout Factory.I have been an audiophile for 30 years and my current system is Krell Evolution electronics and B&W; 802D speakers."
5,Gift for my wife,"I am a Dallas Cowboys fan and my wife is a foreigner living here in Texas (She is from New Jersey). Things get interesting when the Cowboys play the Giants. Nonetheless, I decided she needed a few reminders of her home country and gave her several New York Giants mementos for Christmas. She loved the toothbrush (and the cellphone pouch and mouse pad, and ballpoint pens etc.). It helps keep things more peaceful except for two Sundays a year."
4,Army Training manual,"The acting, dialog, and plot of this movie are stilted and crude. The characters are more like types from an Army training manual than real people. The moral lessons are at pre-K level. But this movie is filmed in Europe in the years immediately following WWII, with real uniforms, real settings, real war equipment, and historically accurate events. Taken by itself, this is a 2 star movie at best. With its superlative realism, the movie is a 4 star movie, a must-see for any student of history and any fan of war movies."
2,Glad I watched it . . . once,"Not bad, with a rather original, realistic and mature story line. That being said, I thought the movie didn't rise to the story behind it. Mediocre acting, etc. Rather unsure about this movie. The two-star rating was a flip of the coin."
1,NOT a good movie,Really this movie has nothing to redeem it's value.Do not purchase this unless you've seen every other movie made and really need another movie to watch.One of the worst movies I've ever seen and wish I hadn't paid for it.
3,Wearing Dad's Head,"Wearing Dad's Head is a wonderful book of short stories written in the inimitable style of Barry Yourgrau. Reading his page long short stories is like being caught in a dream: anything can and frequently does happen. Wearing Dad's Head is entertaining, but the author's ""A Man Jumps out of an Airplane"" is a more creative and illuminating example of his work."
4,Whearing Dad's Head :Stories,"This book was very good. This book was about a single dad who is a nerd scientist. There's tree guys who always pick on Joe, the dad. One day Joe came into his office and his invention was gone and he knew wqho took it and he needed it to show his boss. He got mad and fell and this invisible chemical fell onto his body which made him invisable. I liked this book and i would reccomend this book to any body who likes science."
2,unsure of accuracy,"As much as I admire Troy Stetina's products, I must admit I am less than pleased with this guide. To start with the tabs for world famous opening to Smoke on the Water is absolutely incorrect.The difficult intro to ""Lazy"" is not included. The tab presentation starts much later in the song, and they themselves are incorrect. It's like they could not figure out the intro so they got a little ""Lazy"" and left it up to us.Now I admit it's not always easy to figure out these difficult complex Blackmore songs, as he has often a complex attack. And I am no giant expert. But I have studied these two songs by watching Blackmore on Youtube and video performances.I am not confident in the accuracy of the tabs in this book."
2,Online Features Don't Work With IE 7 Content Advisor Turned On.,Online Features Don't Work With IE 7 Content Advisor Turned On.This product has been confirmed my Microsoft Tech Support not to work with MS Internet Explorer 7 Content Advisor (IE Parental Control Feature to protect kids on the Internet) turned on at this time. They couldn't give me a time extimate for an update that would fix the problem.Jim.
2,Don't understand how anyone could rave about this book,"How can anyone rave about a novel where people do things that don't make sense, do things that NO ONE would ever do? When authors do that it makes me mad. It's like the author thinks that their readers are complete idiots.On top of that, within ONE PAGE the car that some character is driving changes from a Chevrolet to a Cadillac!! Can't even keep track of something so simple??WITHIN ONE PAGE!!!!!! WTF????I became so disgusted with this that I stopped reading it half-way through. I think that I am about finished with Masterton's writings. I loved his earlier books, have been a fan since the 70s, but now, more often than not, they suck."
1,Death Of A Gunfighter.,"Not sure why this film was made this way or why it was made period,The Women are beautiful but this movie is not A Western,The Locale might be A Western or made for a Western,The Acting is horrible,the only thing worth hanging on for(no pun) is for Carroll O'Connor(God Rest his Soul) getting his in the movie for being a wisecrack."
4,better than the critic`s say,"third universal vault series dvd we have watched,and so far it`s the best,prestine picture and very good mono sound if viewed via a new hdmi a/v amp,movie is better than the film guides or critic`s give it credit for,ok Widmark fell out with first director,and this is the first movie with the Allen Smithee name used,which hides the real man in charge,this happened to many films over the years,when a disbute arose between actors and makers.John carpenter used it once as well,but it does not show in this movie which has turned out well made,lots of well known b-movie stars in it,town against it`s marshall nothing new,but still rates as one of the better later sixes westerns,on a new LED large screen tv ie 37 inch,it is just great to look at go buy now."
2,Not my favorite Richard Widmark movie,"I love Richard Widmark and thought he was underrated as an Actor but this isn't one of his better films. It starts off 'ok' with him as an aging Sheriff in a town moving rapidly into the 20th Centuray and no longer in need of his kind of Law Enforcement. And the inclusion of Lena Horn, the gorgeous light skinned African American singer, as his 'quasi-girlfriend' who wants Widmark to retire and be with her was bold casting for this 1969 production. Ninety percent of this film was fine but the ending is so horrible in my view that I can't recommend it or purchase of this film (I doubt I'll watch mine a second time). A FAR, FAR better film with similar themes is ""LAWMAN"" WITH Burt Lancaster, & Lee J. Cobb which is flat out great."
1,Frustrating and disappointing,"Wanted to give this to my mother for Christmas. I've spent two days trying to get it to work (and I'm a computer geek). On the phone with Philips three times - have uninstalled, reinstalled, firmware upgrade - tried four different USB ports - It just plain won't transfer pictures.It's a BEAUTIFUL item - resolution terrific, but I don't want to look at their sample pix - I want to look at mine. : - )Will send to Philips - but they will only exchange. Once the kinks are worked out, this will probably be a wonderful item, but too late for me and it is EXPENSIVE."
1,Absolute Junk!!!!,Returned the first one as it completely died within the first week. Second one lasted 1 day. Avoid Phillips digital photo frames. Go with a more affordable and reliable Kodak or other.
4,Nice Idea for a Holiday Gift,"I've been using the Philips digital picture frame for several months. My experience has been so positive that I am giving two of them as Christmas presents, one to each of my daughters-in-law. Contrary to earlier reviews, the frame is not limited to 10-20 images if you use only the integrated memory. If you resize the images you want to load to 720X480 pixels (or thereabouts) using, for example, Photoshop Elements, you can get as many as 70-90 images on the device. On the other hand, the criticisms of the users guide are spot on. That shortcoming is why I limited my rating to four stars. Not everyone who buys a product like this is capable of noodling their way through the software interface."
3,wife didn't really like it,I thought this was going to be a really cool gift...but my wife didn't really like it. Ended up being stuffed in a box a few months after we bought it and never got pulled out again. Screen is too small and if you don't have a modern style in your home it just won't look good anywhere. I would recommend buying one with a much larger screen and a wooden frame. That way it actually makes it on your wall somewhere and looks like it should be there.
2,"Looks good, but...","I bought this frame 13 months ago. When it worked it looked great. It gets one star for the display quality and another for the overall styling.The user interface is OK. I didn't need the manual to operate it. However, it is very intolerant of any unsupported file formats. Instead of showing an error message, it just hangs and usually needs a manual reset to get it going again. This is not a big deal I suppose, but it would be nice to not have to parse through all the pictures for stray thumbs.db files that were added by Windows.The display had been off (but still plugged in) for over a month. When we turned it on again, it wouldn't come on. I talked to a nice guy at Philips customer support, but he couldn't help me because the unit is 13 months old now. I can't argue, because I know it's a 1 year warranty, but it sure is frustrating. I paid half again the current advertised price for this unit and now I either throw it away or experiment. BUMMER!!"
5,The Best,"The clarity is amazing. I bought one for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! The only problem is that I'm completely lost when it comes to technology, it was difficult for me to resize some of the pictures. I let my boyfriend do all the technical stuff and he thought it was easy to use. Guess it just depends on the person.He keeps the frame plugged in all the time and let's the slideshow play continuously. So far, no problems. The frame never overheats and it plays perfectly. Definitely worth paying more for this one!"
1,"We bought 4 and they ALL BROKE, in different households!","This is an absolutely beautiful product when it works. We bought 3 of them for grandparents' Christmas presents last year, and one for me for Mother's Day in May. All 4 units broke! None were dropped or mistreated in any way. My Mom and Dad are on their third return cycle now, and my Mother-in-law had to return hers twice (the first replacement was nonfunctional right out of the box.)To their credit, Philips has promptly and courteously replaced them every time they break. Still, the failure rate on these is nothing short of astounding."
4,Great Product; poor software,"As noted in other reviews, the picture quality is great but using PC software is terrible. All the software does is let you copy pictures to the frame, but there are no editing features.When plugged in, the frame shows up as a USB drive - it's easier to size and edit your pictures on the PC and then just drag them to the frame."
1,Huge Disappointment,"- NOT Mac compatible (but I tried on our PC as well and was less than impressed)- the user friendly ""auto run"" program was hopelessly complicated- includes a ""quick start guide"", but no manual....that's on the disc that is not Mac compatible"
5,Great product,I have purchased 4 of these after I received one as a gift. So easy to set up and great picture quality. Makes a great gift!
2,not quite.....,"For $129, I felt that a frame should like nicer than this one did. For not much more, I was able to find a better quality wood frame that looked more expensive. Not to mention it was an 8"" screen & better resolution."
4,Like the Frame,"I bought this frame for myself for Christmas. I love the look of the frame and the picture quality is great.The cons are, that there is not much storage without a media card. So get a media card. After I downloaded my pictures to the media card it was a little difficult to figure out how to few them once I plugged the media card in to the frame. It loaded the pictures put it would not show them. I then took out the media card and the pictures were stored in the frame. I thought that was wired since the directions just said to plug in the media card and the pictures are ready to be viewed. I figured that the media card stays plugged in, in order to view the pictures that are stored on it. But you have to take it out.Also, the stand does not lock in very well and falls of very easily when you pick up the frame.Overall so, I love the frame. Just some minor problems."
5,Good picture frame,"Purchased this for my mother, but tested it out before hand. I am very happy with the product. It has very good resolution, most of the pictures are taken with a 5MP camera and are crisp on the frame. The slide show mode is good, and especially the option to have it turn on and off at certain times of the day (ie - on at 8am, off 8pm). Highly recommend."
4,Great Christmas Gift,"I got this frame for my wife for Christmas. She loves being able to put up to 70 pictures on the frame for viewing. I would have given 5 stars expect for a few things:1. The menu system takes a lot of getting used to. It's not always clear which button needs to be pressed depending on what your doing.2. Vertical pictures do not always display correctly in the frame when using it horizontally. We tried the rotate picture option, but the results were inconstitent. After fighting with it for a while she just deleted the vertical pictures.3. It's unclear how long you can run the frame on battery. It would be nice to have some indicator as to how long you have left. This is minor because we normally have it plugged in, but I thought I'd mention it."
5,Best in class!,"After a lot of research, bought this for my parents for Christmas. This frame is so superior to the competitors on the market! Picture quality is amazing, it's easy to use, and enormously compatible with everything.My only complaint is the enclosed software...it's primitive and buggy. But, it's also unneccessary. Just plug it into your PC and treat it like a flash drive. Or stick in one of the many different memory stick formats it accepts.Picture quality is fantastic."
4,Good frame,"This is a nice frame - but be ready to tinker with the software, which is not intuitive. Save yourself some time and just buy a SD card and a card reader and do all your image manipulation on your computer, not on the frame."
2,NOT user friendly!,"After spending way too much time getting my mother-in-law's to work, I then tried to set up mine. It froze during picture transfer and now doesn't work. The user manual is worthless. Now I'll most likely spend the rest of my holiday with custom service or just return it. Looks nice but a royal pain!"
2,Customer Service Warning,"Can't really rate the frame because it was defective out of the box. Saw a couple of pictures of mine on it before it went completely and it has good resolution. However, I will warn you about Customer Service at Philips, or rather more acurately, the lack thereof. If you have problems, do not, repeat, do not call Philips for help (unless you speak Hindee, they still would know nothing about the product, but you could probably have nice chat about something) and do not send it to them for exchange. Get help, refund, exchange only from Amazon for this one. Trust me."
3,Good Product - Poor SD Card support,"It is an attractive product with a clear picture and great sound for it's size. Seems fairly easy to use but will not support any SD cards > 1 GB. It will read a 4 GB SD care if it has a USB adaptor so I'm guessing it not a problem that is correctable with a software upgrade (i.e., it appears to be a hardware issue...not sure how this got through the testing department without discovery). Is this mentioned on the box or in the manual? Of course not. Does the tech support center know this - according to other reviews, only about half the time."
4,Digital Picture Frame,"Works very well. I have added a 500MB SD card and so can show a lot of images.I would have given it 5 stars but for its price and the relatively small SD card it comes with. I see they have some cheaper competition now but I don't know if the image quality is as good.The instructions were designed by someone to make the page look ""cool"" rather than be most helpful. It took longer than it should to figure out the controls. Easy once you understand them. I don't know why manufacturers don't give the product to someone unfamiliar with it and see what problems they have with it.All said & done, this is an excellent way to show your images and sure beats a static print. Because they are lit, the images look more like slides. I wouldn't go any smaller than this size."
5,Everything I expected!,"The resolution of the pictures is excellent for the size of the frame. The best I found for this type of item. I was able to load 71 pictures onto the built-in memory, more than I expected! I love the ability to remove the frame from the cord and continue to view with the rechargable battery. My mother, over 80, is the recipient of the frame and is able to use the controls easily. Now she can view her grandchildren through the years, as she no longer travels. The only problem is that the CD and online software are not designed for Macs. I cannot use the USB cord to download and instead use the smart media card from the camera."
4,"Great Frame, a ""Mom Pleaser""!","There are so many reviews for this product, I'll be brief. My wife Loved it! I wasn't sure she would care for a piece of ""technology"" but this case getting all of those digital pictures somewhere where she can see them all the time is great.My only complaint is that the way the memory card interface is utilized is a bit weird and non-intuitive, but otherwise the device works as advertised. I have not used the provided PC software and simply accessed the device directly through USB."
4,beautiful original music,"Technology was so close to solving these problems yet driven by their dreams they looked the other way. These inventions could never work and no one back then could tell them otherwise.You begin to feel sad and in some cases embarraced by their stupidity that they did persist with foolish ideas.The music enhances the sadness and the end scenes and music capture the entire feeling of the movie...""that dreams can come true"""
3,WE THE NEED DVD,"I hope that this will be released as a DVD. It is a great movie for educators, history buffs and people interested in inventions."
5,Put Gizmo on DVD!,"This short film is one of my favorite movies of all time, with all flaws and odd clips. It allows us to review some of the history of inventions from the standpoint of ""normal"" folks who have great imaginations. They fly, they try, they fail and try again! I love the failures as much as the successes and obvious preludes to those who also have imaginations, but finally get it right. One of my favorite parts is the tree climber. I really love this movie and would buy it in an INSTANT if it were on DVD. I already have it on VHS and love it just as much in each viewing. I'd also give it as gifts to my friends! Come on, someone (legal), put it on DVD! Then send me ordering information."
4,Save Gizmo,"A great inspirational movie. It is great for answering the question ""Why try?"". Unfortunately it will never be transferred to DVD or Blue Ray. So if you have a VHS copy making a personal transfer would save it not only for your self but for the future."
1,Total nonsense,"I have taken a course with Renshon, and read portions of his writings on this subject before the book was published. It's not so much that I'm opposed to his partisan perspective -- he's entitled to that if he wants it.The real problem is his complete disregard for any standard of social science research methodology. He has given up on trying to explain what happens in reality, and instead focuses on the alleged psychological issues of Bush as they relate to his father (presumably all emanating from some sort of ultimate Oedipal complex).His research relies almost entirely on media reports and Bob Woodward's 2 journalistic accounts of Bush. Renshon attempts to put Bush on the couch from afar, and utterly fails."
2,How Does George W Bush Succeed By A Psychologist,"This is a pro-administration book. The author's presentation in the book is very sympathetic to the President and his administration. The polls show the public trusts Bush according to the author. The book lays out a very upbeat analysis of the President. The author is a psychologist and the author attempts to psycho-analyze the President from afar. He spoke at an author event in January where the attendees seemed to be underwhelmed. The author added that people have underestimated George Bush for over ten years, in his opinion."
1,Description is wrong,This product is NOT for 3mm socket heads. It is too small and does not work for 3mm socket heads. It is a 2.5 and it functions for 2.5 mm socket heads. The description is WRONG. The price is so cheap its not worth the time and effort to return it.
2,Blah!,"This was marginally okay as the short story Ms Garrett published, but I didn't think it had enough ""umph"" to be a full-length novel. Nick came off as being wishy-washy and so whiny that he was an irritant, and he is my favorite character from the show. When I finished the book I had no sense of accomplishment, either good because I'd enjoyed the reading, or bad because I'd felt I'd wasted my time. I just didn't care!"
5,Mortal or not...,"Nick is almost a mortal but not quite.What a great book!!! I loved it!!! Susan ,I can't wait for your next book!"
5,Wonderful characterization and depth,"Ms. Garrett has an accurate grasp of the Forever Knight characters and a very accessible style of writing. At the same time, her plot is very original and allows her to look at those characters from a unique angle and a fresh viewpoint. As television novelizations go, this was a cut above the norm. I sincerely hope to see another effort from this author in the near future!"
4,"Good instructions, great photos","This is a wonderful book for learning to make a wide variety of mosaic tile projects. Clear, step-by-step instructions are both written and demonstrated with full-color photographs.Sixteen projects include tables, frames, jewelry, containers, floors, and walls. There are also designs for outdoor areas, as well as the kitchen & bath. Numerous pieces of other magnificent artwork are also displayed throughout the book.There are over 30 great templates featuring many designs. Some include flowers, celestial elements, a large angel & a mermaid. There are several animals including a unicorn, butterfly & dragon as well.My only wish is that a list of suppliers was included, I found some of the materials difficult to obtain."
4,Tangled web of deceit and intrigue in Oxford,"In Last Enemy, Insp. Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the identity of a decapitated body found in a canal. Meanwhile, Morse gets called on to investigate the apparent disappearance of an Oxford don. The man who calls him in is an old college rival of Morse's who is now a Master at Oxford, and it becomes very apparent that Morse can barely stomach the man who is full of airs and graces and extremely arrogant.As the story progresses, Morse and Lewis unravel a web of intrigue involving an attractive young graduate student; rivalry amongst the Oxford dons (a recurring theme in many Morse episodes); and even body parts on a kitchen chopping block! As customary in the Morse episodes, viewers get treated to a story centering on human compulsions, notably greed and ambition that lead to homicide. Highly recommended for fans of superior British crime procedurals."
4,Good Workout,Did this workout for the first time and found it a good basic workout. Time will tell if I see results but will definitely do this workout again.
3,It's OK,"Would like it more if she took the time to explain/show the moves instead of just doing them and letting you ""jump"" in."
3,Just okay,I was hoping this exercise video would be a little beyond the beginner level. This dvd is strictly for beginners in my opinion. The direction could be a more fluid as well from move to move. I could do the whole dvd without barely breaking a sweat.
5,Good,These workouts are just what you need if you want to have results quickly. Short enough for someone on the go and cheap so that you do not need a membership to the gym.
3,"Juicy, Entertaining, but not Credible","This book was definitely an enjoyable, entertaining read; very juicy. The only thing that bothers me is credibility. The book is written as a biography of Joan Crawford's career and love life in particular. Nice details about her films and the other celebrities she worked with. However, there are no sources cited anywhere in the book. The book is written almost entirely in quoted dialogue of conversations between Joan and others, and there is no possible way that the author could have actually been present during many of these conversations. Authors need to be careful when using quotes so much! The author did have many conversations with Joan and others who knew her, but she never recorded any of these interviews (which she admits in the beginning of the book). The dialogue is so detailed it leaves the reader feeling that its content may have been subject to much bias and faulty memory. So, enjoy a good easy read, but don't take it all as the truth!"
2,"Great production values, terrible movies.","Not too many stars for this set of films. I have always liked ""Midnight Cop"" so I gave it 1 star for this, and 1 star for Brentwood's production values. IF you love these films, you cannot go wrong with this company. The films are well-produced (1 movie to a disc side) and they come in a hard plastic storage case for protection. However, these are not top-of-the-line films and there is not a subtitle option. OTher than that a decent B-Movie company."
5,Super.,Both of the operas are unequaled. Best performance shown by the conductor & orchestra to the last performer.Güngör Arel
3,TOO MANY CLOSEUPS,"Musically, a triumph.Visually, that's another story!Too many closeups, closeups of flowers, architectual building details,cactii,flowers.I was hoping to see more action, the ending of Cavalleria was plain disappointing.For a much more satisfying experience of this two operas get the Zefferellifilm with Domingo and Obraztsova and Bruson in PAGLIACCI and Domingo, Stratas and Pons in CAVALLERIA.That's a great double bill."
2,Not worth the purchase,"There are a lot of books out there that talk about child development and what to expect for new parents. This book really does not give you any specific things to look out for. Basically it is written like a self help book with not much in the way of guidance. For child development get the book called ""Baby Steps"" by Claire B Kopp, PHD. In addition, the stuff in this book is made into an applicable 5 step process for calming your baby in the DVD and book called "" the happiest baby on the block"".The Dr. Spock books dont go into depth in any one area. I suggest finding specific topic books on the areas of interest to you. A lot of things in this book are things that once I had the baby did nothing for me. In addition, when you leave the hospital , the nurses and pediatrician seeing your child at the hospital go over this with you prior to being discharged.Don't waste your money on this book."
1,386 Compatible Only,"I picked this up [inexpensively] and encountered the common ""You get what you pay for."" Later that day, I drove it back. This software doesn't run on Win XP, or 98. Only thing I can guess by the date of the product, it goes back to the 386 and maybe 486 non-math co-proccessor days. Too bad because it is suppose to have about 30min. of castle footage from some BBC special. But, if the footage is monochrome or VGA quality, you'd be better off finding the video. Interplay provides little support more than what is commonly known about these MS-DOS products already circulated (PIF, driver issues, and other compatibility notes). This is typical of some of the larger companies though. It's very sad that the product has almost slipped beyond 'the bin' to 'abandonedware'. But if you have a 286 you might love the graphics because everyone I talked to can't see them."
2,disappointing,I was disappointed by the anti-Catholic tone as well as the accomodationist attitude promoted by this video.
1,It is definitely NOT MENSA LEVEL,This is a review of the 2002. I was so dissapointed I quit doing any of the puzzles. It's the same type of challenge over and over again; and none of them are of the level that would challenge a true Mensa candidate. Some of the quizzes have multiple logical solutions. Others have no solution other than a wild guess.
1,Boooo.,"The selections are questionable. I have almost the whole thing on tape from when it was aired.Also, the most visually and musically striking performance by far was Pink Floyd's finale. Even better than the moment when Sir Paul McCartney played ""Hey Jude"".Pink Floyd played five songs at the end. Not two."
2,Disappointed,"When you see the list of performers (Phil Collins, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Pink Floyd just to name a few), you think this must be one of the greatest music DVD's yet released. Sadly, this is not the case. The DVD shows only two or three songs from each performer and the sound quality is `poor' at best. Save your money. The `what it should be' is so much better than `what it is'."
2,Knebworth 1990,"I was at the concert. This set is ok, a bit of a let down if you were actually there. Some of the best performances were left out due to weather related sound problems. Sunshine of Your Love was the best performance of the concert with Clapton, Knopfler and Elton was just amazing....who cares if the sound was messed up, it should have been on here. I don't know how I would rate this overall, since I was there, I'm a bit partial. I guess 2 out of 5 stars would be fair."
2,Same bad video as earlier DVD plus serious audio sync issues,"The earlier stereo release DVD was a disappointment because of the annoying video artifacts. The editing was pretty much a hack job with most of the best performances from each artist eliminated. In spite of that, I decided to purchase this version. This has the same faults as the other along with a major audio sync problem most of the time. Its so bad you may wonder at times if the audio recording was from the same performance. There is no excuse for audio sync problems this severe.What a shame!! This could have been a great DVD had someone taken the time to correct the technical and editorial issues. Perhaps somebody will see the sales potential and release a new longer version in the future without the technical problems. Anyone who recorded the MTV airing years ago on VHS has better video than this DVD has."
1,A great concert...DVD has bad audio/video and mfg issues...,"I agree with other reviewers...I remember this concert quite well and the audio/video work is terrible. In addition my copy was unusable with severe mfg flaws beginning at Phil Collins performance and continuing through the remainder of the DVD causing lock-up, video and audio 'stutter' and severe pixelization on high caliber equipment. I am highly dissappointed with this purchase and hope that whomever remastered this onto the DVD with 5.1 never produces another deliverable again. In addition, the company that released this DVD lacks quality control in their cutting process...."
3,Further clarifications...,Trivial but true. This 1990 Page-Plant reunion was the third time they'd shared stage since the 1980 crash of Zeppelin:1985 - LIVE AID w/John Paul Jones + drums:T.Thompson/Phil Collins1988 - ATLANTIC RECORDS 40TH ANNIV. - w/ JPJ + drums:Jason BonhamIt was the first time for the duo to play England since Led Zeppelin headlined Knebworth back in 1990.JOHN HENRY BONHAM - 25 YEARS GONE
1,HUGE LET DOWN,"This is the one single biggest concert of all time and finally they bring it out on dvd and they mess it up they show more of the artist that arent really known and less of the best stuffespecialy PINK FLOYDS ENTIRE CORE OF THERE PERFORMANCE LIKE WISH YOU WERE HERE SORROW AND THE BEST SONG,COMFORTABLY NUMB I THINK THEY SHOULD RE-RELEASE IT WITH MORE OF PINK FLOYD BECAUSE THATS THE BEST OF THE WHOLE SHOW WITHOUT THE ENTIRE PINK FLOYD SHOW THE DVD IS WORTHLESS AND ALSO THEY NEED TO SHOW MORE CLAPTON.PLEASE TELL THEM TO MAKE A SECOND DISK WITH MORE PERFORMANCES IT WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY AND IT WILL BE WORTH IT"
4,Very happy with my purchase,"For the Chicken Basil-Blue Pasta alone, you should buy this book. It's one of my favorite things I've ever eaten. Yum-O!As with most cookbooks, there are some recipes I like and some I don't. Overall, it's definitely worth it. Don't try just one recipe and then never use it again. Try to pick recipes that include ingredients you know you like, and try those first."
1,Not so quick or small sized meals,"I was disappointed with this book. It promises ""Quick meals for busy couples"" but only has a few of those. First off they include alot of meals that serve more than 2. A good portion of the meals take 40 minutes or more to cook. Alot of the recipes were not very appetizing from just their names. It was also kind of bothersome that they did not separate the sections from one another. I was able to scrape 1 recipe I would like to try from this book so that is why I gave it a rating of 1."
3,Maybe he's getting middle-aged,"A defining moment in my musical history was when I heard Kevin Yost ""Small Town Underground"" (#1) for the first time. Wow, such great music! Number 3 is a disappointment; Kevin Yost lost his mojo."
5,No reservations,"I am a Deadhead rather than a true blue Moe.ron, but I have been listening to Moe. for a little over a year now. Volume 6 is the second Warts and All box set that I have (Volume 2 was the first). I loved it from the first listen, which is not typical for me. The jamming was beautiful and seamless. Highly recommended. No reservations."
2,A Dickens of a How-to,"This great-great grandson of Charles Dickens, who is the brother of novelist Mary Danby, should write another ""How-to"". Or hire a publicist to keep this one actively in print...."
2,"Inadquate info. on world retirement loc.,& finance handling","Nice pictures but need more world retirement destinations to call it a ""World"" book. For early retirements such as at age 50, need names of reputable finance institutions that can handle accounts while retirees are at play in the sun. You can either add this information to your next update or write a new book on retiree finances that include 401K's and early retirement options. I would love to see something of this nature. Good luck."
1,Title misleads about content.,"Actually, I would give this book 0 stars. It does not give one iota of useful information. ""World"" is limited to 6 or 7 U.S. states. There is nothing about other countries. I would not suggest this book to anyone who wants concrete info. It has some pretty pictures! What a waste of $$$."
5,Better than what I expected.,"I used this for a costume for the Zombie Walk. I love the material, though, it's a bit resistant. So when I was splattering fake blood on it, it was a bit difficult. Though, if I were to use this for actual working purposes, the resistance would provide quite useful. The fit was good, and it provides an elastic band on the back waste and extra bit of room for expanded movement. I will say the qaulity of the material does feel slightly cheap. Can probably use multiple times if taken care of properly."
3,May not be write for you write now,"This is only helpful if you are brainstorming a writing project with no real clue on what you want it to be about. I usually have a passion for the story before I write it and have some idea about where I want to go. If you are the type that begin with vague concepts and story ideas this may help you, but don't be surprised if you give up half way through and start writing it freely with out these writing construct and parameters that can at times stifle your story creativity, flow, and passion. It almost reminds me of referring to the APA Manual when I wrote graduate term papers."
3,Doesn't work on VISTA!!,"I am very upset that I just paid all this money for it and the product won't even install on Vista. That's extremely frustrating. I do have an older PC, which it will run on, and I've had some use for it, I don't quite like the interface, it's not very graphic friendly, -large blocks of text, not so many visuals, but I'm sure it will prove to be useful- only I can't use it on my main computer which I can't stand"
1,"Overpriced, difficult, many downsides","It is a software for writers unable to create their own story. It is complicated, confusing, unclear interface, poor instruction manual, using their own terms not universally or industry standards, is not included a common sense component - a full word processor - for writing without using another software, not helpful support.You should look for alternatives."
2,As Much as I loved E&J...,"The song ""Crazy for this girl"" is great and all but you'd think the rest of the CD would be good too. (I actually fell in love with them for that particular song)Then I bought the CD and I was very disappointed. The lyrics on some of those songs are awful. I mean do something with those great voices, dont create a song about talking on the phone! I was expecting them to be somewhere on the lines of the Goo-Goo Dolls but they are nothing but a boy pop band!I got sick of the CD in one week."
5,Their Best - Rocks Heavily,"Easily their best record. The music is loud, brash, sharp, precise, and exciting. The lyrics are somewhat pointed, and different from the usual adolescent-oriented rock-and-roll concerns. It's a peak, and a great underheard (in the U.S.) record. Unfortunately, the band did not remain at this peak but went and experimented with other styles (to mixed results)."
4,Finally A Decent Edition,"Although this is about the 5th time ""Setting Sons"" has been released on CD, this edition is by far the best. In '79, when the original LP was released, the group issued a couple of of UK singles around the same time. Unfortunately, none of these singles were included when the LP was first issued on CD, and subsequent releases have repeated this oversight. So buyers have been stuck with a CD of only 10 (or 11 since the US LP included 'Strange Town' as an extra track) cuts. This Collectors Choice edition finally addresses the situation by reissuing the LP with a total of 19 tracks, including some which were released right after ""All Mod Cons"" and ""Sound Affects""-era stuff like ""Going Undergound"" and the ""Dreams of Children"". If you liked the original ""Setting Sons"" this is a great collection."
2,Feels like someone just recorded a yoga class,"I am really not a fan of this DVD. The instructor doesn't do the asanas herself, but assists the other people, correcting their postures. The main problems with this is that you have to constantly be looking at the tv to see whats going on. She corrects the womens postures but doesn't explain this really to the viewer in a way we can ensure we are doing it correctly. I find she also talks really fast and it just starts feeling like annoying chatter, its not relaxing. She doesnt engage with the viewer, it is just like you are watching a video of someone teaching a yoga class to their students rather than teaching you. The setting is nice and the music is quite relaxing but the way that Tara teaches on this DVD is really not for me."
1,Yoga mumble,What a disappointment. Yoga instructor mumbles something very fast and mainly to herself. You definitely can lose weight - mainly by getting more and more irritated!
2,Transformation???,"Minimal instruction in this tape is beyond unhelpful --- if you don't know what you're doing (i.e., have already had a good deal of yoga instruction), you can really hurt yourself. Tara's anorexic-looking body doesn't help things. For an empathic teacher who gives both good instruction and motivation (vs. ""good you guys"" by Tara), see Suzanne Deason'sYoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. Women of various sizes do the poses --- and the most advanced poses are NOT done by the thinnest person. Setting and music are very calming. Also recommend Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners. This is a very beautiful DVD --- the settings are spectacular, the music is wonderful and Shiva definitely brings you to a new level of openness and ease.Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners"
1,Not awesome for beginners,"This is definitely not for beginners. It is a more advanced yoga class which has been videotaped. The students already know what they are doing, so if you are already familar with the poses, you guys might find this dvd awesome. It is not a teaching video because it is too fast to learn. Unprofessional with too many, ""awesome you guys"" spoken. I would have appreciated the dvd stating that it is not for beginners. This dvd would be awesome if it was shot over, taught slowly, with a professional script. On the bright side, Tara Stiles is beautiful and knowlegeable. I would love to have a body like hers -- wish I could follow this dvd!"
5,amazing value,"I don't understand the less than stellar reviews on this product. I'm used to doing the yoga that Tara posts on youtube and I am certainly a beginner. I found this easy to follow, easy to hear, easy to understand. I also think the meditation section and the explanations of how yoga and meditation work and help you are wonderful! I was surprised at the length (i believe around 50 mins) and the additional features. I feel like I got a GREAT deal."
5,"great video, my all time favs.",Own both videos and wish they would make a few more so i can have a nice rounded collection. if you can't get to a class these are the videos to practice. everything just flows together nicely.
1,mehhh!!,"I bought this thinking that it will INSTRUCT me when I'm doing yoga. Nope. She shows how she is 'instructing' people in her class, rather. The moves themselves are not hard to follow but how am I going to do that? I should either keep looking at the screen to see or I will not be able to understand anything, as all she keeps saying is 'awesome guys'. She didn't even do the part with 'music only' herself! That part is the previous part, just 'silenced'. This is how you make a Yoga DVD without doing any moves yourself.Try Mandy Ingber instead, if you are a beginner."
3,it's okay,"a bit fast for beginner, and i prefer to see Tara doing it rather than other girls doing under Tara's guiding."
1,I greatly disliked this book,"This book really isn't worth it because ,while it does focus on voodoo in some respect, all the authors really talk about is their extreme dislike for Christians and Wiccans,and they tend to focus on high ceremonial magick( i. e. Golden Dawn, Enochian, Thelema, etc....) rather than actual voodoo.The authors also talk about themselves throughout almost the entire book,and very often stray from the subject at hand."
1,Impossible to read,"The author rambles on with no coherent thoughts or conclusions. While some may find his observations of interest, I didn't find any value in any part of the book. Information is scrambled all over. It made my head hurt to read and I just didn't make it past the first chapter. I found myself skimming through the rest of the book hunting for some useful information. I failed."
1,Racist and Ignorant Author,"This author spends most of the book giving very dangerous and watered down hybrid Santeria and the rest of the time he is complaining about the black and latino population of los anegles. This is a typical no-nothing white person making people ""play around"" with low level spirits who most likely just are laughing at the dumb, genric, Barnes&Nobles ritutals that this person wants you to do in this book. I threw this book away."
3,"Digressions, but ultimately useful","Black and Hyatt go way off on tangents concerning magick in general, which was a little disappointing, since we can get that stuff from their other books, or from other books on western, non-African-oriented magick. However, the last several chapters of the book ultimately prove useful, and it is certainly possible to begin a voodoo practice based on the practical information they present."
1,This book is anti-everything except Voodoo,"I am an African-American Wiccan who looked into this book because of my interest in African divinities. What I found in this book was attacks on Wicca, Thelema and other non-Christian religions. Wiccans were characterized as ""loud, obese women who lack personal hygiene skills"". We were also characterized as ""mentally unbalanced"" because we don't practice the type of animal torture that this duo of ""mentally sound"" practitioners of voodoo have no problem with.There are good books on the market for Wiccans/Witches looking to expand their magickal horizons, but this is not one of them."
4,Hmmmmmmm,Well being a child of Eleggua this book was interesting and informative on how to create and work with a traditional part of Santeria the Eleggua head. Here in Detroit there are virtually no Santero's or Santera's so this book helps where there is no traditional teachers.
4,something differant for the western magickian,"As stated by some reviewers. This book dosen't realy present authentic voodoo. I don't think it was the authors intentions to present authentic voodoo. This book is more geared twards the western magickian who wants to incorporate elements of voodoo into their practices, but dosen't want to practice the religion of voodoo. I like how they show that elements of voodoo can be blended with wester ceremonial magick. I also appreciate the personal accounts of the authors. This shows that they have experiance with the practices they describe.If you are looking for traditional voodoo, don't bother with this book. But if you are interested in incorporating some elements of voodoo into your practices, by all means get this book."
4,"Everything you wanted to know, almost","Good information. Contains the usual attacks on Christianity, but of course it always makes for a spine-tingly amusing read. Unfortunately many people can't get past the black/white duality in their own minds which prevents them from SEEING outside of the bubbles they live in. They just don't GET IT. Anyway, the book lacks a clear formula for producing desired results, especially as far as the use of altered states of conciousness in ritual is concerned. I found this to be a pattern with these particular authors but the quality of the information is overall quite good. Voodoo is a facinating subject for me even if I don't use it in my practice (mind you, the drum music is quite effective for me), and Urban Voodoo is a book I'll re-read from time to time. Some of the sigil designs in the book are pretty cool too."
4,No problems yet,I bought this memory simm some time ago and have had no problems so far. It is amazing how much of a difference and additional 512 MB of memory can make. Over all very satisfied with the purchase which arrived within two days of my order being placed.
4,Great Beginner's Guide to LB Films!,"As a beginning polymer chemist, this book was a wonderful reference. It covered all of the topics I needed to know and provided an easy way to learn the necessary vocabulary. I highly recommend this book to beginning researchers and anybody interested in LB films."
1,My Bad...poor choice on my part....,"This book is totally elementary. It was NOT worth the money I spent....and I could find much more details data on this subject via the internet and google, which I did. Waste of paper - waste of money."
3,It is out of date.,"This book is very interesting. I did not realize how old it is until I tried to find an auger. It has been over 12 years since the company listed sold those and they don't remember who the vendor was. Of course, the prices listed are out dated also! It seems like a good home project but make sure you can find the necessary tools, parts, etc."
4,Best for my needs,Of the several books available on well digging yourself this book comes closest to giving me what I needed to know for a shallow well in my area.It is dog eared and I have read it through too many times to count.
2,Simple,"Totally uninspired. They put Radiohead to a string quartet but there's no personality to it, they've just drained Yorke's voice away and replaced it with a replica on strings. If only they had brought their own vision to the work instead of trying to reproduce it on different instruments. To coin a phrase: there ain't nothin like the real thing."
4,a good string quartet tribute,"The way these string quartet tributes go is that you either love them or hate 'em. ""Enigmatic: The String Quartet Tribute To Radiohead"" is a worthwhile endeavor. As far as my bias goes, I also adored ""Strung Out On OK Computer: The String Quartet Tribute To Radiohead."" Both produced by Vitamin records, the projects share the same musical vision. The arrangements are straight forward but well done. So while there won't be any epiphanies, the music is deeply satisfying. My confession is that while I know ""OK Computer"" inside out, I'm not too familiar with the rest of Radiohead's discography. Considering that I don't know many of the originals, it is remarkable that ""Enigmatic"" has resonated so strongly. If you're open-minded about both the string quartet thing and Radiohead, ""Enigmatic"" is a safe bet."
1,Sent the wrong CD and I never got the item I purchased!,"I bought this CD right before christmas for my mom. The package arrived on time but instead of The String Quartet's Tribute to Radiohead it was the String Quartet's Tribute to Celtic Woman. That really sucked. So I emailed them and asked them to send the correct CD, that is all I wanted, but instead they let me keep the wrong CD for free (which I didn't even want anyways, and was promptly thrown away) gave me a refund, and never sent the correct CD! I definitely will not be purchasing anymore CDs from them because you never know which one you will get!"
5,delicious,"a young korean boy ran past my stoop yesterday morning, he was full of the wee and vinegar that makes children climb trees and wrestle coons by the lake. He tripped on my pottet begonias and went headfirst into a row of daylillies waiting to be put into the ground. He was out cold for 3 days, and i listened to this cd, which he had in his german fanny pack. I can't decide if the vomit made me listen, or listening made me vomit. Either way it was delicious, i'll have seconds....mmmmm maybe thirds. oh dear im naughty, somebody punish me."
3,Good Book,"This book was very good. Although, after reading the first few chapters, I could predict most of what would happen. Cyril, a 16-year-old fat kid who loves to cook and is trying to get into a good cooking institute, has a secret crush on his friend Rose. Rose loves a man who can cook, but Cyril has always hidden his talent of cooking from Rose. When Cyril's best friend,Nick, comes into the picture, Rose and Nick start dating. But, the thing that turns Rose onto Nick is the food that Nick serves, but Cyril has prepared. Rose soon finds out that Cyril cooked the food that was served to her. The ending is interesting, but somewhat predictable. I do recommend this book for kids and teens interested in cooking. This book also has recipes."
5,A flavor to savor,this was a really interesting book. I felt as if I could practically feel Cyril's depressing self. I loved how the author named the chapter after the recipes Cyril made. It was a very great book and I reccomend it to anyone who likes romantic stories
1,badly written,the book is so simple and boring even if the plot might be slightly interesting the writting style is total crapola
3,Listen to the samples first,"I bought this CD on impulse because all I'd heard on the radio were exquisite piano works. I was looking forward to a CD of piano music--and what I've heard is superb. NOT! It's mostly a cocktail lounge type of smooth jazz-OK for what it is, but not what I expected. Shame on me for not doing my homework."
5,A Handy Addition,"We have a regular cannister vacuum and have been using it on our hardwood and tile floors as well as carpeting. We had a dustbuster to clean up small areas but the battery kept running out. Now with the Dirt Devil Powerflex, we have a vac that is much easier to move around and does a much better job on our hard floor surfaces. It is light and rolls easily so getting into tight spots and under cabinets is a breeze. It has a lot of power and does a much better job than our old dustbuster. The hose attachment is great for reaching areas above floor level.All in all, if you have tile or hardwood floors, this vac is a must and a perfect addition to your old vacuum!"
2,It Broke!!!!!,"Let me just say that everything Cythia Rhodes said (bottom) is true. And to add insult to injury it broke today, not even 3 months after I bought it. The base is soooo flimsy that it broke at the joint!!!! It did serve its purpose for me while it lasted (I only live in a studio though) but its not worth the hassel!"
3,Broke into pieces!,This vacuum worked great for about a year and then literally broke into two pieces.
3,Just not the same as the Dirt Devil Stick Vac Plus,"I bought this vacuum thinking, for some reason, that it would be a lot like the old Stick Vac Plus of years ago, but it's not. What I don't like is the fact that you can't make the flex head stay in a triangle position - you have to press it into the corners to get it into that position but it doesn't stay that way, so it doesn't work that great trying to get underneath my kitchen chairs the way the old stick vac did. It's too much work to maneuver it around. I just miss the original Stick Vac Plus...the one that uses the bags. Dirt Devil should have never changed that design...nothing has compared since that vacuum, in my opinion and I have a lot of ceramic tile floor to vacuum daily because of our dog. Looks like now I'll be searching eBay, yard sales and flea markets til I can find another Stick Vac Plus."
1,"Ugh, I wish I hadn't...","Fooled by the looks of this upright ""wanna be."" If I could rate it less than a 1, I would. Absolutely worthless on anything but a bare floor, won't even do flat, hard surface throw rug. There are no wheels on the head so you have to push down on it to move it along carpeting which makes the head fold into the ""V"" shape when you don't want it to, which is also very frustrating. Low on suction/performance, high on price at the retailer where I purchased it. When looking for one nice thing to say about it I decided it's kinda fun to watch the wind tunnel in the clear, see-through dirt ""collection"" (as if it could collect anything!) chamber."
3,disappointed,"It doesn't go under the bed and furniture, falls very easily ...I would return it if I didn't have to pay for shipping.It's flexible on the corners, so if you are interested in that it works good."
3,"stylish design, a bit fragile plastic construction","+++ nice design, the 45 degree head helps at the corners.lightweight--- the plastic joints are a bit too fragile+/- Bagless is a mixed blessing.Although the weakish suction power it was doing the job well until the joint connecting the suction head to the body broke. Found the DirtD customer service quite responsive: they promtly referred a repair center near-by. From 2 weeks to 2 months to get the part though..."
1,Low cost nightmare,"I absolutely hate this vacuum. The cord is short. The power is weak. Empting the dirt canister is awful. Finally, I don&#65533;t believe that it is possible for the vacuum to stand upright unattended; it constantly falls over. I wish I could give it no stars, but Amazon&#65533;s rating system won&#65533;t allow it. I would recommend sucking dirt through a straw to this worthless machine. Only buy this vacuum if you feel the need to punish yourself."
2,Can do without it,I am a A620 user-I can click picture of same size without he lens.-The macro feature of A620 is awesome and one doesn't need this lens if work distance doesnt matter.-In case you are looking for work distance this lens adds distortion.
1,Wrong part,Using Amazon's part finder this switch was to work on a 1998 Jeep Cherokee 4.0 liter. well it's not the right one. Amazon was great to take it back with not charge to me but be aware of proper fit.
1,Save your Money,"I bought this watch on MSN Shopping Channel with the extended warranty. The first week the minutes ring on the timer on the outside ring fell off completely---but not having another watch, I continued to wear it. About four months later, I looked at the watch and the hands inside had completely fallen off and were rattling around loose inside the watch under the crystal. Being very busy, I still have this watch in it's yellow Invicta box in the back of my car. I won't get it replaced because I don't want another one. I won't EVER EVER buy another Invicta watch again because I have never had anything like this happen with another watch...not even a Timex! I agree with the other reviewer who said his review had one star because you can't give it ZERO!"
1,Defective watches,Ordered two of these diver watches for water sports - Both were defective. The watches are advertised as having a crown which can be screwed tightly to keep it waterproof. This feature on both watches did not work and I returned both of them becasue of this defect. The only reason this review showsInvicta Women's 10 Collection Morgan Diver Watch #3630one star is because I can't give it a zero.
2,Not happy with this item,"I bought last year's model of this item, essentially the same item. It worked great at first, although the complaints about volume control turned out to be true for me as well. I had to crank up the volume to watch a tape, and then when the tape was turned off, the tv would blare. My biggest complaint is that after 3 1/2 months, the VCR quit working altogether. Nothing happened to cause it to break, it just stopped functioning, with a tape stuck inside. I've had a stand alone VCR for 8 years that still works--3 1/2 months is not very long. The warranty for labor, of course, is 3 months. Usually Panasonic has quality products--I don't know if this was a fluke, or the advice of others to stay away from combos is true."
5,Are you kidding this book is great!,I can't believe that only ONE person read that book! I LOVED it. And I am just a kid. I read two books on the same pack and this one was the second one I read. At the sad part I cried in this book even though I already knew what happened and I don't normally cry in books. He was a strong author and he told about his life he left his own soul in that book and no one bothered to even write a REVIEW even except for one person. This book is extrodinary! You should really read it. You will be pulled in to it as he tells about how wolves changed so many people's lives. You have to read it. I may be just some kid reading a book that is ment for 15+ but I have as much say in it as anyone else. You have to read it. You will never see wolves in the same way again.
5,We had this album when I was young and it got lost. Now it's found!,This was one of my favorite holiday albums my parents had. It was lost somehow over the years. I was so happy to see it on CD!
5,Old and the New,"I have both of these albums (on vinyl). The first album (1963)seems to bring out the true meaning of Christmas while the second album (1966)has the more popular / familiar songs. I bought this album for my sisters because we grew up with the NCM. Yes, the NCM went through a lot of changes but their is a continuity in their style."
4,Love the New Christy Minstrels!,This album had a song on it that I remembered from my high-school days. I had looked and looked and was thrilled to find it at last!
5,Christmas With the New Christy Minstrels: Complete,"This CD arrived in perfect condition in less than a week. This is the first time I ordered anything from Amazon and I am very pleased with the price, quality, and service."
1,Too much latte,"This album will just about wear you out. The Christy Minstrels must not need to sleep or they drink way too much Caffiene. Even my 12 year old was getting a little edgy listening to this. Similarly, if you like traditional treatment of traditional christmas music this album isn't for you. I had hoped for better."
2,CHRISTMAS IN-YOUR-FACE,"I was tired of this collection after the first three selections. The music is loud and almost irreverent, it's in-your-face. No sense of rhythm. Songs like ""Silver Bells"" become unrecognizable. Too many selections are novelties. Mind you, the opening number ""Beautiful City"" is infectious, but the Lennon Sisters do a better job on hat. Poor phrasing. No feeling for the season. This is a disaster. They sound like a bunch of drunks who stumble upon a coffee house at 5 a.m., after a raucous night on the town."
4,A FINE WESTERN from the 1950's,"An enjoyable movie, nicely filmed with the scenery only the American West has. This western has a good story and was made in the era when most good westerns were produced. Don Murray, Richard Egan and the rest of the cast make this a fine film. Being a western collector I have added this one to my collection. I would like to see Don Murray in 'From Hell to Texas' and Richard Egan in 'Tension at Table Rock' released on DVD which were made in the same era, two fine westerns."
5,the good ole days,"well i remember seeing this at the sanger theater in pensacola,fl so its old memories now being relived when i was a very young man."
2,LOSERS ON THE LOOSE,"Originally filmed in 16mm for German television, RIO DAS MORTES is Rainer Werner Fassbinder's darkly comic tale about Mike and Gunther, two aimless men who concoct a half-baked plan to go to South America to hunt for treasure.The guys never quite make it to the treasure site, but they have one hell of an adventure negotiating around the objections of Mike's girlfriend Hanna.The story idea is credited to director Volkor Schlondorf (The Tin Drum).This perverse character study was Fassbinder's eighth film. He went on to make 33 more and established himself as a stylized storyteller with a savage eye for human foibles and follies.Not a great film, but interesting if your writing a term paper on the evolution of the Fassbinder ouevre."
2,more of the same,"While it purports to be a particularly perceptive book on contemporary France -- thanks to the publisher's blurb -- it is just more of the same. There are dozens of books over the last two hundred years by Americans and Britons trying to explain the peculiar nature of France. The French themselves, unless they have been too influenced by ""anglo-saxon"" concerns, don't bother to explain what cannot be satisfactorily explained without embarrassment. Fenby has nothing much to say that an intelligent observer could not figure out for himself."
3,Is France Really so Bad?,"When the book starts with all that's good about France, one gets the uncanny feeling that the rest of the book is going to be extremely critical. And it is true. But the book is very enjoyable, especially for readers interested in contemporary politics. France is indeed a great country with a rich culture and like any other countruy has its own skeletons in its closet. The book indeed provides a deep insight into this. It gives readers a totally new perspective about France. The writer, having lived in France for a long time and having been a political correspondent, writes very autoritatively about France. But one cant help feeling that he is after all an Englisman who is writing about his 'pet-hate'-France, hence the writing would be lop-sided. Well that's what makes it so interesting and spicy. Its a condensed version of france written in a racy tabloid style with real facts. Highly recommended."
1,engine would not run - returned for refund,"Model engine would not run. Followed emanufacturers directions, and got assistance from other modelers, but would not run, fuel ran out of carbuerator"
1,this looks shabby and unsafe,"I just got this today. The package box in which it was stored is shoddy, with lots of little tears in the cardboard, and quite worn on the corners of the box. Originally this box top was sealed with a thin strip of reinforced packing tape. It was not sealed when I got it. The instructions were at the bottom of the box, but that isn't enough to make me want to keep this. The insert states that this set is the ultimate in polycarbonate cookware. Polycarbonate has become a questionable material from what I have read. Had I known that before I ordered this, there would have been no order. I don't know how old this set is, but it had to have been shoved around in some storeroom for some time to make it look so shabby. This is classic garage sale stuff. I don't trust the safety factor, or the ""old"" look of this set, and will be returning it."
4,"Pretty scary, better than most","I don't want to give away anything, so I'll be vague, but I thought this was a pretty decent movie.It's a little slow to get started, but makes up for it by quickly moving through a certain part of the story that other movies of this type spend way too much time on. I also like how the victims weren't nearly as stupid as the idiots that populate other movies. (What's that noise? I'll go upstairs alone to find out!) The characters are believable in their reactions, which is rare in these types of flicks.I didn't see the plot twist coming. It makes me actually look forward to a sequel so we can see if she continues down the path she is on or if she becomes a vigilante monster killer.Overall, this is a nice fright movie. I recommend it."
2,Artistic and Clever but not my cup of tea,"I have no knowledge of the budget or intent of this film, but was not impressed by all the crazy-scary music and creepy attacks. If you like vampire movies, I bet it'll be right up your alley! But throughout the majority of the show I had no idea who was being attacked by whom or why I was supposed to event be afraid at all. Lots of shaking screen shots and screaming and chasing but not enough information visually to keep me from thinking, ""What the hell is even happening??"""
1,Not Scary and Predictable,"SPOILER ALERT! I don't get the high marks for this film. It wasn't scary at all. I was looking for something to elevate this film based upon the four and five star reviews, but nothing, folks. It started out okay, kind of intriguing and went downhill from there. The creatures were some kind of hybrid-vampires, but they give vampires a bad name. Oh yeah, they were ""blood thirsty creatures."" If that isn't a vampire... The beginning of the film where the box gets punctured let's you know what's going to happen to the kids. And really, the guy at the beginning trying to buy beer who wasn't old enough? Come on, the guy looked every bit of of his thirty-something years. Predictable characters, predictable plot."
5,"Burden Brothers know how to ""Bring It!""","The Burden Brothers full length sophmore effort is truely an amazing CD. It's definately a must buy if you like to to crank up your tunes and rock out! This CD has it all....Vaden's vocals are amazing, Casey, Rizzo, and Zack keep each track hummin' along with their great musicianship on guitars, and Taz keeps the Bro's in the grove with some awesome drumming. Every song on this CD is excellent."
4,Burden Brothers not just new Toadies,"I gave the Burden Brothers new Mercy CD only 4 stars because I was originally a Toadies fan, and I grew accustomed to that style of rock. This CD is not quite as hard and....like the Toadies as I thought the Buried in your Black Heart CD was. Mercy Definitely has its own sound, which I wouldn't say is bad. Definitley not bad. Mercy brings out a new level of Todd Lewis, in lyrics, and music. Ex.: 1)Lyrics are have same basic point as always; they are just at the next level of elaboration and depth. 2)The music is as good as ever; the only difference is that twang that taz bentley is bringing to the band. (that's my guess, it may be Todd or any other band member. But there is a new twang) So go buy the new Mercy CD and write what you think. It's a great CD."
4,Album number two.....and not slowing down.,"The Burden Brothers ""Mercy"" is an absolutely smoking set of songs. This album relies less on catchy melodies and more on powerful riffs than the last disc did, although that album is plenty catchy. Overall, it's a great, old school rock and roll record, with a nice combo of great melodies, arrangements, and lyrics.Love,Jables"
2,Meh,"I am a huge fan of the Toadies and the Burden Brothers' earlier release, ""Buried in Your Black Heart"". I very much wanted to love this album. Alas, my initial impressions of ""Mercy"" were almost entirely bad. I gave it a half-dozen listens in the hope that it would grow on me. It did not. In fact, I liked it less with each pass. The whole album strikes me as contrived and tired. The sound production is technically correct, i.e., loud and you can hear all the instruments, but uninspired and devoid of dynamics. In retrospect, none of this should have come as a surprise. The cover and promotional posters feature a photo of the band that looks exactly like this album sounds.All that said, there are two or three good songs buried deep within this bag of...filler."
5,Everyone should read this book,"Actually, only people who are men with ""issues"", or who know men with ""issues""--I guess that is everybody.I am just about finished with the book, and think it is one of the best things to help me ""grow up"" (I am pretty old already).It has a Christian world view."
2,Notebook Girls don't cut it.,I bought this book as well as Cocktails In Paris from Amazon.com. Both arrived the same day and I started both. I only finished Cocktails In Paris because at least the characters are good people. Notebook Girls should be ashamed of themselves. Students acting like this are just dumb. And the society we live in is getting dumber too if all we make is this trash. The characters are just bad students who lead a bad life brought on by boredom. Skip it.
3,"If you're looking for it, don't look here","I was first interested in this when I saw the girls on ""Today"", and they talked about the book like it entailed many interesting girl-teen stuff (i.e. smoking weed, sex, etc). There really isn't much sex stuff in this book. One recounts about their first time, and the most interesting page in the whole book is where one describes what it's like giving ""head"" for the first time, but she doesn't go into details. Mostly just joking about ""penis"" and stupid girl stuff. One of the girls' handwriting is terrible, the book can sometimes be hard to read. I was left disappointed in it. I read it at a books-a-million without buying it, thank the lord."
2,Get Real People,"OK - I read it, and I agree...either one of the girl's dads or moms had a real ""in"" with someone in the publishing arena for one reason or another....or...these girls really had the drive, knowledge of how the publishing industry works, can network very well, and have copy editing skills along with the ability to attract agents, editors and publicists.Yes - lets go back to the believable premise that one (or more) of the girl's parents managed the processes that it takes to write a book, get it noticed, sold and publicized. So lets congratulate her or him on their top marketing and opportunistic skills and leave these high school girls some small credit for their input on topics of today's teenagers.Its nothing special from a literary standpoint. Its special because the publishers want us to believe some young people could put this together and fool us."
1,hard to read on Kindle,We purchased this book in the kindle format and were disappointed that the graphics do not transfer well in this format.
4,Good,"This book, as you know is about the lives of 4 girls. It was hard for me to tell who was writing and remember who they were talking about. But sometimes it was funny and they are very real people."
4,Good Book,Carla..you want clean youthful books like there used to be...well im sorry to say that the book FOREVER is pretty much the same thing as the notebook girls. it goes into detail about sex just as much as this book. as for the notebooks girls i think that it does a good job of showing what teenagers really go through during high school. that its not as easy growing up in this world as it used to be.
4,"Wake up, folks!","To those who are shocked! that this book exists and how dare Katie Couric ""celebrate"" the vulgarity and antics of these four teenage girls, wake up and smell the Starbucks -- this is what teenage life is like all over the country today. As the mother of a 16 year old girl who was raised with good values, in a loving environment, this year has been a real eye-opener for me. I have a pretty open relationship with my daughter and have learned some pretty shocking things about what goes on -- and about what she does. And I'm sure she's only giving me part of the picture. If you think this book is NOT reality then you are probably in denial. Instead of looking at it as an evil how-to guide designed to corrupt kids, take it as a rare and valuable insight...use the information to inform your discussions with your own kids, especially if they are not as forthcoming as you would like."
1,Parents Beware,"I purchased this book for my thirteen year old daughter for Christmas. I am very glad that before giving it to her I reviewed it. This book is filled with profanity, drug use and other inappropriate material for teenagers. I did not care for this book at all. I guess it is a true diary between teenage girlfriends and it is very explicit. If you purchase this for your child I highly recommend reading it first."
3,Not worth it.,I thought this book would give some insight into teens' way of thinking but it's mostly just junk. Not particularly insightful and certainly not well written.
4,Good Steamer,"Fast delivery by Amazon with free shipping, is a bit slow to heat up but works great for a long time with a large water capacity and I like buying an American made product. If you need a heavy duty product I think this will fill the bill.I should have bought more attachments as it has a lot of potential for more uses."
4,Jiffy Steamer J4000,"Steamer is a very good product and suggest those looking for a 50/60 htz steamer this is the one. All other steamers fail to heat up enough to produce plenty of steam. Only thing I suggest is that the extender that holds the hanging item needs to be a about 24"" more."
5,WORTH THE MONEY!!! Easy to use and takes out all the wrinles,"Great buy, easy to use and I can do 5 pieces in a few minutes. I haven't even had to put more water in the machine over the last 6 months and use it on occasion when we return from trips and need to steam out our clothes instead of sending to the cleaners. I probably could have been fine with the less expensive model since I don't use it very often but since it wasn't very expensive I figured I would buy the top of the line."
5,"Great Machine, worth every penny!!!","I just got this machine. It's a gift from my husband, he says it's an wedding aniversary gift...of course I can't wear it on but it really helps with my aching shoulders. I have arthiris on my neck and shoulders and regular ironing cause me a lot of pain and discomfort. The assemble was very easy, and does not damp my clothes like another two steamer we had in the pass. The first one we had for a couple of years until star falling apart. My husband got me another one call Home Touch and did not last one year, the same thing broke right away. Then I decide we should invest a little more money and after I read all the reviews I decide for this one. It's quite, and I don't have to fill it every five minutes like the other two. My only complaint about this machine is the pole is too short, but nothing is perfect in this world. I really recommend this machine, it's worth every penny."
1,Do not buy in Australia,"I have wanted a steamer for a while now. I did extensive research online and Jiffy seemed the best option based on other reviews on here. I found the best deal on Amazon and had it shipped to Australia. I had a plug adaptor so wasn't concerned about adapting the plug for Australian outlets. However, after I opened the package and plugged it in I have discovered that the voltage is not suitable for use here. There was nothing on the Amazon site to suggest caution and Amazon willingly sent it to me knowing that they were posting to a country where it can't be used!!! Not happy. The warranty is now voided and nearly $300 later I am stuck with an item I can't use. It is an expensive mistake on my part. I think it is poor service to be sending electical items knowing that the voltage does not suit my local power supply. Shame on you Amazon."
2,Worked great for 1 year- now it's dead,"I bought this a little over a year ago because of the rave reviews. I will admit- it is a powerful steamer and I loved using it. However, just over a year now it has completely stopped working. I turn it on and the light comes on- but it never heats up or steams. Over $200 is quite steep for an item if it will only last a year."
3,Ok but not great.,"I thought about returning it, but changed my mind after putting water all the way to the line and trying it on very delicate fabrics. It does not work as well with with cotton blends and other fabrics, but works very well with delicates. A half way full tank is not as efficient. Make sure you top it off with water because when the tank is not full to capacity (there is a line that tells you when to stop pouring water) it is not as efficient."
2,Doesn't do much,"This thing takes forever to heat up, does NOT remove wrinkles better than a regular iron, and drips water spots all over your clothes. Don't use it on silk unless you like water stains."
2,Expensive Regret,"My 12 year old Jiffy Steamer died, after a repair 7years ago. I decided to get another Jiffy and upgrade. The steamer works fine. My issue is that it takes at least 20 to 30 minutes to heat up. Wanted to steam a Pashmina at the last minute wasn't an option. I purchased a Home Touch Perfect Touch for my cousin for Christmas, loved it heats in 45 seconds. Came home, purchased the Home Touch, emptied the Jiffy and stored in closet."
4,Practice and watch your hands,"Shopped quite sometime to find a steamer as I HATE ironing. This unit provides a great amount of steam. My cotton shirts turn out wrinkle free and my husbands heavy cotton shirts, including cotton duck jackets, look great too! I have used this on just about all types of fabric's with success. You know those roll up hems on jean shirts & others when worn untucked...gone! You have to watch your hands though and I think if you had something you could put behind the clothes you would get nice creases. I am just not sure I am going to pay for one of Jiffy's boards, I use my ironing board leaned up against a wall....aahahahaha Jiffy, lower your price! Lastly when you hear the gurgle, hold the steaming head above yours to clear the hose of built up moisture, this will prevent water spots on your clothes."
1,A Waste of Time,"After reading all the great reviews on this steamer I was anxious to try it when it arrived. First I tried to tackle one of my hardest shirts to iron, a white slightly heavy, causal button down. Its so hard to get this shirt looking good that I'm tempted to throw it out every time I find it in the laundry basket. If the steamer could handle this it could handle anything I owned!Well, it didn't handle it. I spent twice as long steaming it as I would ironing it and it didn't look any better. OK, maybe that's not a good place to start. I grabbed some wrinkle-free shirts. I always leave my dress shirts hanging to dry. I thought for sure one of these would come out great! No. Again, it took forever and still looked bad.Stick with an iron. I am going to write the company. After what I spent on this thing it should do a much better job. Maybe its useful to steam things you can't iron but if you think its going to help with weekly laundry think again."
2,Did not meet expectations,This product and its reviewers promise a magical machine that removes most wrinkles with ease. I did not find this to be the case. Awkward to use and really requires the use of the Jiffy board (which costs an extra $100). Nearly impossible to remove wrinkles in cotton shirts. This product did not work at all for my needs.
3,"Great product, but not for tall people","I'm 6'3 and the pole that comes with the steamer is for very short people. I have to hang my pants and shirts on the door or get on my knees to steam my shirts and pants (not kidding). Other than that, love the steamer. Solid construction."
2,Not for Me,"I bought this steamer to replace my much hated iron. I have to iron uniform shirts, tee shirts and khaki pants every morning. I found the steamer to be much less effective on those items than an iron and more time consuming. I am terribly disappointed because I very much wanted to throw my iron away. Instead I am exchanging my steamer for a new iron."
4,Love It !,"Works like a charm, the first time used it, I went through 10 button up with collar shirts in 18 minutes and it creases the arms, which impressed me.The only con I have, is resting the head of the steamer, it's awkward and it has to be precise and even that isn't very stable, I plan on creating something that will hold it while I hang up the pressed garment and get another.It seems costly at $250.00, but I figure the time it's saving me, it has already paid me back.It's made well, professional and industrial like, no cheap hardware, it's obvious that it's built to last.I have never used a steamer before, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.I bought this based on researching it online and reading reviews."
3,Too Large,"The steamer is an excellent in taking out the creases and wrinkles in clothes. However, it is cumbersome, requires a definite amount of water and emptying the steamer was what I didn't like. If you want a steamer for one or two items, I wouldn't reccommend getting the J-4000. Something, smaller would serve your needs better."
2,More For Commercial Than Home Use,I got this Jiffy steamer for my wife who uses our old steamer all the time. I thought this would make a great upgrade for her but she found it to be too big & cumbersome. She felt it was more suited to a commercial business than for home use. We returned the product & received a credit promptly so great service on the return.
1,"VERY flimsy containers, arrived all smashed up","I ordered one of these cases (packages of six) to give as Christmas presents to multiple people. Sadly, upon arrival, every single individual container was smashed open. The external box was not mangled - I have to believe this was a byproduct of the brittle, thin, flimsy individual plastic containers, in combination with having been shipped along with giant cashew tins in a large box with minimal packing materials. Although I think had the container packaging been sturdier this would not have been a problem. In any event, it was a disappointment that none of the packages arrived intact."
4,get hooked,"neighbor suggested this band. He was right on about how solid they are.A little angsty,but not enough that an adult listener cant enjoy it.The music is competant enough to carry you over that angst right into a fist pump!"
5,Dope-Life,"If you've already seen my review of Felons & Revolutionaries, you'd know I like this Dope CD better, basically because they don't sound exactly like the infamous Marilyn Manson... This CD is very good and I like the first 8 songs. If I had to pick 3 favorites, they'd be: ""Take Your Best Shot"", ""Now or Never"", and ""Stop"" because they are without a doubt the heaviest. Songs like ""What About..."", ""Die MF Die"", and ""Nothing (Why)"" don't exactly have the best lyrics, but they're still pretty good. Fans of Limp Bizkit, Staind, Cold, or KoRn will like this. I do..."
2,get angy again!,"I miss the anger from the first album and Dope isnt the same.. .they are singing? what in the world?! I wanted to hear some more ANGER and if i want to hear singing i will listen to metallica! DIE MF DIE is the highlight. THe album is ok... but it is NOT better then the first one. But, I mean its pretty hard to top "" bang and your dead , f*cker "" hahah I mean how do you top lyrics like that? hahahah"
2,Boredom Of Rap Metal,"How can these guys do something here when it is not very good rap and how did they sneaked when it unoriginal even the guys from Biohazard can do better than this.The well known song for being terrible is ''with or without you'' which has some of the most mind-numbing lyrics they don't make any sense for example''I can't see anymore,I can't walk out the door'' and has a hook that's simplistic and annoying.Dope were all right on their first now they stink on this one by their repetitive lyrics.For someone who wants to get a better album try the groups first album ''Felons and Revolutionaires'' because it's better and has my favourite even though I'm not into much of Dope's music is''everything sucks''."
1,hmmm....,"All of the people that are disappointed with this record because it doesn't match up to their first, I just have one question...""What were you expecting?""Their first album was a blatent rip off of all the NU-Metal bands to emerge from the depths of garbage cans nationwide way before Dope ever came out. They suck, and this release is no better, it sucks. These guys have no talent. The only reason they got a record deal is because they play music that appeals to our throw away society of MTV clones and zombies. Its really sad and pathetic. These guys are no different than a boy band, in fact they are a boy band with instruments who cannot play to save their lives from the demons of real ROCK.Go buy an Opeth album or even Nile if you want REAL metal,a nd bypass this garbage, please, please PLEASE!"
1,Wretched.,"I saw these clowns play in support of this album (I forget who they opened for, someone equally terrible). This band is a joke, go to [...] and check out some of their guitar tabs, a chimpanzee in some Hot Topic gear could play these tunes. Sucky mallrat numetal-poop. At least they don't suck as much as their pals Murderdolls/Wednesday 13. I'd give them a zero if I could. When people complain about crappy nu-metal, Dope should be the first act they think of. Derivative, tired, cliched, all these adjectives are an understatement. If these guys spent as much time on their music as they do their clothes and hair, they might have something. I can think of a 100 other bands in this genre more deserving of your money...Bozo Porno Circus for one, they blow these guys away."
4,Better than last one,i have just heard this album and i thought it was much better than the first one which i thought was not so good. i dont know why people dont like this group all becuase of all the things tripp eisen had to say about him. i think it has nothin to do what people say it is all about what the music is all about.so i would have to give this review a 4 star for him not listening to other crap that has been going on.
4,Better than expected.,A lot of what I look for in good bands I find in Dope. There are a couple of spots where the lyrics are kind of cheesy but that is overshadowed by the power of it's content. This album is necessary to round out a good metal collection.
5,Dope..Take Your Best Shot,"This is not only one of my all-time fav bands but this particular track is so awesome. If you just understand that it's not all about conforming, but having the guts not to."
5,GREAT BUY,"I have been a dope fan for a while, and ""Life"" doesn't diassapoint. Sure, it is more melodic than ""Felons"" was, but it is still a very hard album. Every song is very catchy, and still remain very hard and real. That is how dope stands out from the rest."
4,A very pleasently surprising sophmore effort,"Dope arrived on the metal scene in 1999 with their less than stellar debut ""Felons & Revolutionaries"" and received mixed reviews and feelings at a time when Korn and Limp Bizkit rule what the teenieboppers call metal, and what real metalheads call trend metal. What frontman Edsel Dope's biggest problem on their debut album was he had a Marilyn Manson persona that could really get on your nerves, and on Dope's new release ""Life"", Edsel seems to have dropped it for the most part, and what we have here is a lot less nu-metal/trend metal, and a lot more REAL metal. Of all the bands who say they get more melodic on their new albums, Dope is one of the few that actually know what that means, there is a lot of melody here that doesn't get lost in the ensuing musical mayhem. Songs like ""Now or Never"" and ""Die (...) Die"" are instantly disposable, but the rest of the album is a blast. Hats off to Dope for putting together a surprisingly good album."
4,Kenko 420-1600 Telephoto Zoom Lens,"This telephoto is excellent! However, I must put it on a tripod to get a good shot."
4,NOT FOR THE INTRODUCTORY BEGGINER,"This book is just what it says. Basic grammatical explinations. For more advanced learners of Tagalog it could be used as a very useful tool to understanding how the language works. Begginers will probably find it very difficult to use. It has indepth explinations for all the grammatical rules, however a working vocabulary in Tagalog is helpful. Many of the examples are not translated into English."
5,Great help,"This is an excellent book for those of us who learn languages through a rules-based approach rather than the more common intuitive ""use some common expressions and try to figure out why along the way"" found in many books.On the other hand, if you always hated and never understood grammar and prefer to just dive in to everyday language, you'll probably prefer one of the other books.In either case, you'll probably want to remember that Teresita Ramos teaches proper Tagalog and some of the expressions/word choices in her books may not be the vernacular used on the streets of Makati.Ultimately however, if you have an analytical vice artistic mind and need to understand things from a mechanical framework, this is the best book available."
2,elementary exercices in Tagalog,"This book is not for self-teaching students, but for students attending a Tagalog course or taking private lessons with a tutor as there are no keys to exercices. This is a book for beginners with a couple of weeks' initiation period behind them. The term ""advanced"" used in the preface is puzzling because the level is elementary. The authors still ignore the system of accents devised for Tagalog about a century ago so that their students will have to waste a lot of time checking the proper stress patterns in a dictionary. A good didactic book ought to have all the proper accents."
1,This Product sucks,"It does what it is illustrated. Usually you have the TV and lamp in the same room. I mean why would you have a remote in a room ....for the TV. Whenever you use the TV the lights start going off and on. So it works just like they say it does, but it can be annoying. I just unplugged the stupid thing."
1,Oh Well,"I thought they were ( I bought two ) great.BUT within two weeks, they BOTH stopped working!!!If this is the best they can do... I think I'll sell myScientific Atlanta stock !"
3,realiable,This is a great product easy to use as long as your operating system is Windowss 2000 and above. I used this product to transfer data between computers and laptops. Works great with windows 2000 and above operating systems but Windows 98 and below driver will not install or not recognozed. I have tried several options and trouble shooting tips and reccommendations to install driver on my IBM laptop with Windows 98SE all failed.
2,Kinston 512 MB data Traveler USB Flash Drive,"Product was great. My only problem was the companys shipping charges. For the size of the product, the shipping charges were way out of line. Make the price more, realistic and lower the shipping"
3,Satisfactory,"This flash dirive would be better if it had a loop for a key ring to be attached and an integrated cover. My students immediately lost the covers and could not attach the flash drive to their ID chains, so many lost those as well. It was the right price, but impractical for student use."
5,Fully satisfied,"I had prompt service from the vendor through Amazon. The Kingston 512 MB USB flash drive has performed very well, though I must say I use it only lightly and do not slog it around on a keychain or anything like that. My only regret is that I did not buy a drive with more capacity."
1,No English Subtitle or Closed-Captioning,"No English Subtitles or Closed-Captioning? What the world does this DVD product ever published in the first place? How does deaf can buy this product? He/she find no way of understanding what it talks about without hearing it. Is this film intend to mockery in the deaf community?a deaf conspiracy theorist,Jeb~"
3,Use more Deaf actors,I was disappointed that a deaf actress was not chosen to play the young woman without language. There are many qualified actresses in the Deaf community that could have done an outstanding job. It was otherwise a fair representation of these issues which are still occurring.
3,In MY Opinion,"Book is very informational and seems to be right on with the info, but, not an easy read. Other books of this same subject are written with much more flo and keeps your interest more. But, all in all it is worth having."
4,A Time Travel Adventure Not To Be Missed,"I'm a sucker for any time travel story and this is a good one. The premise is that a group of jaded people from the future go back in time to observe various disasters from the past such as the Chicago fire, the eruption of Krakatoa, etc. The hero is the operator of a small hotel where such a disaster is about to occur and his latest tenants are a group from the future. If you like time travel stories as I do, you'll love this one. Well written and well acted. Fascinating premise; absorbing execution. Maybe this is not the best such story you'll ever read, but well worth your time and the price."
4,underrated and almost forgotten,"This is a fine Sci Fi movie and the roles are well casted. And Hey! I know the man who was one of the set carpenters, so I have a dfferent feel for it I suppose!"
1,Disaster in filmmaking,"Horrible acting, a swiss cheese plot (including the laughable final scene), and childish special effects make this a sci-fi snoozer."
3,Good by high standards,"I'm picky about movies, so my 3-star is worth 4 from most people, except those who need car-chases, exploding cars, and wire-supported stunts. It has one piece of sci-fi that initiates the plot: People from the future time-traveling back to our present. From that point, the plot plays out rationally, though the time-paradox is not truly confronted or explained away. The present-day characters are realistic and well defined, as are their interrelationships. The future people are left somewhat fuzzy, though they are fleshed out as persons, not mere mysteries. For anyone who likes sci-fi or futurist films, I highly recommend this. For the rest, it at least deserves a rental."
4,An overlooked Gem,"This has to be one of the best overlooked movies I have ever seen. The film is carried off by a great actor, Jeff Daniels. He shows without a word the feelings he has for his daughter. It touched me deeply. The film revolves around time travel and how resilient time is. I will not give away the story, but if you like a good story about the 'what ifs' of time travel you will love this film. The special effects are somewhat dated but it is a great story."
3,3 and a half starts for First Twohy film,"By now David Twohy should be a trademark. A kind of Spielberg for B movies. But it isn't. Not yet at least. This man has been directing consistently good genre films for some years now (""The Arrival"", ""Pitch Black"", ""Below"", ""Chronicles of Riddick"") so when I found that its first one was still there unwatched, I immediately took to find the piece and give it a go.What a nice story! Full of logical holes if you have mastered your Doc Brown technique, but what a nice tale nevertheless! Jeff Daniels plays an Inn owner that receives the visit of tourists from a strange place, that came just to be witness to a big event. That's enough information for you. Enjoy the tone of the story, its little town that looks from Capra seen by Spielberg or Dante, that nice orange-yellow glow that pervades so many 1980's films (despite this being done in 1992). Next Twohy movie, I will be in line at the theater."
1,Discontinued,"This item has been discontinued and even though this seller says it is in stock, it is not and they have no plans to stock it."
5,fine footstool,"I am loving my new footstool! Its size is perfect, the color is neutral, and it's strong enough to provide one extra seat in the room!"
3,Material kinda thin,"This is not a bad item as such, but the material is kinda thin which makes it look cheap. It's a dark cream/ivory colour - very nice. It serves the purpose and it still well priced compared to other similar items I've seen. It comes with the beanbag filling which is good - many of the other items I saw didn't come with this, and it can be expensive."
2,not happy,"was super happy to find these on amazon for this price, however, you always get what you pay for. i ordered cobalt blue, which is the exact same color on every suite that sells these. they came the ugliest dark, dark blue - darker than navy blue almost black. quickly called and reordered cobalt blue thinking someone there made a mistake. nope!! five days later i received two more of these really ugly hassocks. love the design - hate the color - bit the bullet"
4,Bean bag footstool,"Perfect size, comfortable and light so my wife can easily slide it out of the way to getup and go do whatever. The choices of colors was great even though we picked conservativecobblestone, it fits right in like it was meant to be there.We love it!The Camps"
4,"Fresh, clean, natural!","If you're used to the heavily perfumed chemical smells of most commercial conditioners, this one is not for you! The smell is absolutely fresh, clean, heavenly; a bouquet of natural oils. Sure, the texture and color are a bit off-putting at first- a little slimy, a little brown. But once you use it, you're hooked. I have had more compliments on the smell of my hair when using this product, and everyone always throws in ""natural"" as a descriptor. It's fabulous. My hair is left soft, full of body, and smelling wonderful. One word of warning, though, and the only reason why I gave the product four instead of five stars: if you have very fine hair, this conditioner is probably too heavy and will weigh down your hair. A little of this goes a very long way, but that's another plus in my book."
1,What a pile!,"I like Panasonic and I was starting to convince myself that all Panasonic products were reliable, and good values. My parents had the older Panasonic VCRs and while I wasn't crazy about the user interface, they were reliable and quiet. This one is not worthy of the Panasonic name and it suprises me greatly that they claim it. I think it was made by Quasar. It's so noisy in playing and recording that I can't hear quiet passages. I thought that was noisy until I heard it rewind, from several rooms away! It exudes cheapness, and what's more, mine won't track worth anything. I can't even play several videos. I'm sending it back! My friend had a similar experience with his, but the tracking on his worked. What a pile."
1,major disappointment,"I had not read other reviews of this VCR before purchasing it, since in the past my Panasonic VCRs have been great - this was clearly a mistake. First, out of the box, it sometimes took up to five attempts before it would accept a tape, and now it won't even accept some at all (the same tapes are no problem in my other Panasonic/Sony/JVC VCRs). Second, the quality of the recorded picture in EP mode is almost unwatchable - lots of ""snow"" and static. By the time we gave up on it, it was too late to send back to Amazon, and now Panasonic wants [$] to repair it! I've already purchased a Sony replacement that works great, and this one (my last Panasonic) is headed for the ...."
1,Paul Gallagher,"I liked the feature of Commercial Advance, and was willing to pay extra for this. However, on playback, I get awful audio noise. Also, Video playback is poor at times. I would have sent it back if I hadn't accidently disposed of packing materials."
4,Really think this is one of the Better Coats out there but..,"it does run large like others have said. I ordered a Medium, as trying on other Dusters at the feed store found that that about where I fit. I ordered this one as it was a nice brown I was looking for. It is thicker and heavier than the reg Dover coats. I really like the feel and design but it is too big. I was going to order my husband one as well but decided to wait to see how it did size due to reviews. I would have ordered him an Extra Large. While my Medium was a little small on him, I now know to only order the large."
3,A Good Little Western,"YELLOW SKY(1949)---Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, Anne BaxterAlthough I'm not a particularly big fan of Gregory Peck, I do like him in this movie. It's a good little western, directed by William Wellman. Peck is the leader of a band of bank robbers on the run. They end up in a ""ghost town"" called Yellow Sky, which was once a mining center. There they encounter Anne Baxter and her grandfather, who still live in the town and have built up a store of gold. The movie is fast-paced and Widmark plays one of the gang who eventually challenges Peck for leadership of ""the boys"". If you like westerns, I think you'll enjoy this one."
3,Some standout moments but not great,"Gregory Peck was a marvelous actor, one of my alltime favorites. I had seen this movie many years ago and remembered loving it. I waited for years and years for it to come out on DVD and when it did, I bought it that day.Sadly, it was not as terrific as my aging memory wanted it to be. There are some very good moments in the film but it doesn't really hold together all that well. The black and white photography is lovely in spots. Anne Baxter is ravishing as a six-gun-toting miner's daughter. Richard Widmark gives one of his less-grating performances (that's a compliment).Overall, it's not one I'll watch over and over."
5,"WILLIAM A. WELLMAN, OPUS 62","***** 1948. Directed by William A. Wellman. 1867. A gang of bandits, led by Gregory Peck, must cross the desert in order to escape the army after their last hold-up. They finally arrive to a ghost town where they meet an old prospector and his granddaughter. After three or four screenings of YELLOW SKY during these last years, what striked me the most yesterday was the religious references scattered throughout the film by the screenwriter and the director. The crossing of the desert, numerous allusions to the seven deadly sins and Anne Baxter as the temptress are only a few clues you can find in this remarkable film. This is also Richard Widmark's fourth movie and his first western; four parts, four incarnations of bad guys that stay in our memory. Masterpiece."
3,Not the Best DVD,"I bought this dvd because I was looking for a stability ball workout that incorporated weights. This dvd had a segment that includes weights, however I found it to be very rough and rushed.I was always taught that when working with weights that it needs to be slow and steady so that you don't injure or over work your muscles. I found that to be the case with two other DVD's as well. (Total mix and quick fix).I've worked out to the DVD twice, because I wanted to give it a far shot. However, a second time didn't change my mind. I also, like the other reviewer, thought it was too long.A book that I would recommend for anyone looking for stability ball workouts with weights is ""Weights on the Ball Workbook"". It has over 350 pictures of exercises with weights using the stability ball. You can create your own work out or follow one of their plans. I really found this helpful and an excellent guide."
3,Not challenging enough,"I exercise frequently (but not in the best of shape) and bought this DVD in the hope of toning up some more. I learned some fitness ball exercises from one of the fitness trainers at the local YMCA and found those to be quite challenging. I was hoping to find more challenging moves on this DVD, but I was disappointed. I found the exercises to be too easy and did not feel any soreness at all the next day."
2,Very Disappointed,These songs are performed when the two singers are past their prime. I was expecting vintage Jack Greene and Jeannie Seely not a recording done a short time ago. Their singing was not as good as their original performances.
2,Is it the real thing?,Is this a CD of the original hit songs or is it versions that have been re-recorded? Does anyone know the work of Jack Greene well enough to be able to tell?
1,bad choice,"This was NOT the True Air Hamilton Beach Filtrete media by 3M air filter I was originally supplied with...Im not at all satisfied with this because you could tell the mesh filter in between the cardboard was very thin held up on the back side by a thin aluminum chicken wire.... The Photo displayed is NOT the product you will receive...this is RPS PRODUCTS, INC. BEST AIR filters"
2,Not what I was lead to believe by the cover.,"The authors who reviewed this book in the inside cover (all of whom I respect) lead me wrong this time! The book's prologue was extremely well written. After that the book slowly grinds to a halt. I am an avid reader. I had to force myself to get thru page 100, waiting for the promises I'd been given by reviewers. Finally I gave up at a major plot point, around page 190. The internals of the book twisted too far from what I'd been lead to believe I was going to read. This writer has lots of promise but seriously needs to work on character motivation and internals... skip this novel and save your money!"
5,gritty vampire romance,"Night Fires is about a female vampire in the French revolution whose mission, given her by her priest as atonement for killing the men who'd turned her into a vampire, is to save those who would be killed. She meets up with an English assassin, and they join forces.The tone of this book is much more... real, gritty, honest... than the usual vampire romance. I think it's because we really see the deep-down emotions of the characters."
1,Horrible story,"First why write a vampire story when you want the vampire to become human at the end and not only does she become human the explanation is so silly. Then what is the point. The authur puts a vampire in the story to sell it, since vampires are in. There is really no point in Simone been a vampire. I mean her other identity is more interesting. Every time she does something bad she goes to church to confess her sins. Michael really did not need her to complete his mission. Come on he is an accomplished assasin and all of a sudden he needs help to accomplish a mission. After they accomplish the mission SHE BECOMES HUMAN what a waste of time. I wanted to put this book down so many times. I took forever to finish it. Also the description is very misleading. Since I did not like this book at all, if I read the second book Dark Enchatment. I will buy it used for .99cents."
2,Disappointed,"Product produces strong steam readily. Hose is stiff with no flexibility. Head is small and does not rotate to move with each stroke. Pole is not adjustable for longer items. Biggest problem is it tips over when extending hose to the fullest. Spent a lot of money for a highly rated machine that is awkward to use. I had my last steamer for 10 years, was much easier to use and cost half as much."
5,Love it! So much easier than ironing.,"Very simple to use, does a great job getting wrinkles out, and much easier and quicker than ironing. If you're looking for a very crisp line (like on a sleeve) I would still use an iron but in every other case, this was perfect."
3,Great steamer but it needs to stand taller,This is a super steamer that does the job quickly. My problem is I am tall and I need the clothes to hang higher than this will allow. Any solution?SS
5,Great product...,"I was in the clothing biz for 10 years and used clothing steamers often.This is just as good as any of the $400 professional units I used.For those who claim it does not replace an iron...it's damn close.For those who claim it does not get out wrinkles from all or certain fabrics, you do not know how to use it.This steamer produces plenty of steam to get out any wrinkles from any fabric.As far as the steam board they have here for $60.I made one for $20, with 2ft x 4ft 1/4 inch mdf board, some door hooks, cotton batting and a large towel for the covering.It works great!!"
2,Am I missing something?,"I bought the J2000 steamer because I was tired of ironing or paying to go to the dry cleaners. The steamer seems to produce plenty of steam, but I was unable to get the wrinkles out of my cotton dress shirts (the reason why I bought it). After several failed attempts, I got frustrated and ended up reverting back to the iron. I'm wondering if it only works on certain types of fabrics, like wrinkle-free or silk. I haven't completely given up on it, but so far it hasn't delivered as I expected."
5,Worked flawlessly for almost 12 years!!,"My wife bought the J-2 steamer in Oct 1999 to steam her wedding dress as we were getting married overseas and would not have had time to have it professionally steamed before the wedding.Since then we have used it on average 4 times a week for the last almost 12 years and it has worked flawlessly! Apart from the ease of use, damage that some clothes may have sustained due to repeated ironing has been eliminated.We used it to steam oxford shirts, my work slacks (including Dockers) and jeans but my wife uses it mainly for her work suits which would have normally been sent to the dry cleaners.Unfortunately it gave up this morning with a bang - I think that it finally burnt out. But hey, we more than got our moneys worth and will be purchasing the J-2000 to replace it asap."
4,BEATS IRONING!,"Love my Jiffy Steamer! Steaming pants is also easy. Instead of purchasing a separate steamer board, I use my old, four-legged ironing board which has an iron rest on one end. In the folded position, rest the board with the pointed end facing forward and on the floor (or on top of a table), with the iron rest leaning against a wall or door. Hook the hanger on the top bar at the end of the iron rest and voila!"
1,Works the same as everyother crappy steamer.,I have tried the target and walmart brand steamers over the years with always dissapointing results. I thought that a more professional steamer would give me better results and take much less time. I was wrong. This steamer takes at least three times longer than using an iron and the pictures people posted of this product with a wooden handle and a cast iron end are wrong and misleading. This is completely plastic and a waste of money. Into the closet it goes.
2,Does not look like picture,I bought this unit becuase it looks pretty heavy duty including the metal handle. It arrived with a cheesy plastic handle. Check this out before you buy it!
5,Great steamer,The steamer is easy to use and fast because you don't have to be as precise as you are with an iron. It's great for me since I hate ironing.
4,Great Buy!,"This steamer is great! It warms up quickly, easy to move around, tank is a good size and it releases wrinkles from clothing fast. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone."
5,Great product,This steamer is great for me b/c I hate to press my clothes. I did some research and brought this steamer. It starts to work very fast and it works well for me. It will not give you dry cleaning result so if that's what you are looking for then you have to iron or bring it to the dry cleaner.
4,Nice product but plastic body was severly cracked,"It seemed to work, but looked like it had been used and was all cracked. I am sending it back as it was a gift for my husband."
5,Better than ironing!,"I like using this steamer for getting the wrinkles out of most garments. As you may expect, it doesn't work as well on thick collared shirts. The steamer itself is built like a tank. Good quality and convenient."
1,Ineffective and poorly design,I have this steamer for a month and the head just melted and broke off front snooze protection. I can't return since it is three days over the return period. What am I going to do with a broken steamer? This is not a good product nor good customer service. I learned I need to read the negative review first and foremost on all purchase from now on.
3,Average to Good,"Given the price I expected it to be a bit sturdier; but overall it was nice. Took a very, very long time to try to get the wrinkles out of curtains. Have not tried it on clothes yet. I like it well enough to purchase it again. What people need to be aware of is that if you use the hose in the upright position for a period of time, the hose has to be manipulated to run the excess water back into the machine otherwise it will spill out on the floor. Kind of bulky to store and a little difficult to move. Given everything said above, I believe it is the best one I could have gotten for the amount of money I had to spend."
5,"Quality, Quality, Quality","I cannot emphasize this enough. The quality of this product is unreal. I have purchased and promptly returned two steamers to big box stores in the past 6 months, and this one is not even comparable. I cannot stress enough how durable, and well made this product is. There is not one weak component on the product. This unit heats up in under 2-3 minutes, and it incredibly easy to set up. There is even a wrench that is magnetically attached to the bottom of the unit for easy tightening of the rod - should it come loose. My wife cannot put it down, and my shirts have never looked better."
3,Overrated,"Requires a bit of passing through the fabric to get the wrinkles out. Like other reviewers have said, you can burn your hand if you don't have your technique down. The good feature with this product is the limitless water tank. I bought a mini steamer from the mall and that worked much much better. I can't use that though because it only stored enough water for one clothing item. The Jiffy heats up fairly quickly. Within 2 minutes and its ready to go. Lastly, you will need to find space for this item."
2,Hard to use.,"Maybe I just did not like it, but it was not very easy to use. It did remove the wrinkles for the most part, but it was a very time consuming process. An iron takes less time and it will make shirts look much more crisp."
4,I love it!,"I have looked at different steamers off n on for awhile, finally chose this one! I love it! It doesn't take the place of an iron, I don't know why people would think it would, quite honestly, BUT I can use it for 90% of things. I had practice using a steamer years ago, so maybe it has helped now. But, I steamed my drapes and put folds in them! It was easy and fun! Stayed up late the night I got it, playing! Great shipping time. It is easy to setup and use."
5,Best purchase of the year!,"I used to have a 30-dollar steamer at home. But as time goes by, the efficiency of that steamer went down steeply.This is a quite expensive steamer, but since time is most precious, the time this steamer has saved us is priceless.In addition, it saves my time from shopping, since a sharp old shirt is just as nice as a new one. I consider it my best purchase of the year!!"
4,Steamer -[ OK,"Steamer works pretty well as advertised - the top hook doesn't hold the wand too well, but good enough. A little water remained in the reservoir after use that was difficult to pour out because I wanted a dry appliance when storing in the closet. I like how easily it moved from place to place. I'm using distilled water so there won't be any hard water scaling."
4,Pretty Good Item,"I am impressed with the streamer itself, however I think I am missing a part because I'm unable to make the steamer holder stand up. Other than that the steamer works great!"
3,Good steam but not as good as iron,"I bought this item based on the many postive reviews it received. Perhaps I had high expectations, but it doesn't get rid of wrinkles the way I expected it to. It definitely does not replace the need for an iron. I was hoping to not have to dry-clean my husbands dress shirts- but this doesn't get the wrinkles out enough or give that ""dry-cleaned look"". The iron does produce a lot of steam very quickly & is good to use on mild wrinkles for certain fabrics. However, if you are looking to remove wrinkles all over an item or deep-set wrinkles- you will need to use an iron."
2,Not sure I'd buy again,"I bought it for my husband who wanted one but has never used it. I tried to steam one of his very wrinkled shirts and it's quite a bit of work. However, I think for sweaters and other delicates a steamer might be the best option so we'll see. Keep your iron."
5,jiffy steamer,The jiffy steamer I ordered is all it is cracked up to be. Very good. I will never get my iron and ironing board out again.Thanks
2,Don't bother purchasing this steamer,"I found using this steamer on a garment actually took longer than it would have ironing it. Also, water would drip from the wand when the steam was coming out. The water droplets would leave water stains on my garments. I returned this item."
3,"Great at gettng rid of wrinkles, but not sturdy","I am a stylist and use this to steam clothing for photo shoots. It works great on all fabrics, I use it for denim, silk, satin, cotton, nylon, ect. The only thing that bothers me is that it is very unstable. We have two and one constantly leaks water all over the floor because it has fallen over multiple times. If the garment that you are steaming is too heavy then the steamer may fall over. Also, the pole to hang the clothes on becomes loose after doing the front and turning the garment to steam the back. The pole is only one height which makes it complicated to steam floor length gowns.If anyone has trouble getting wrinkles out, try steaming from the inside of the garment. If there are still wrinkles then they are probably permanent. I've had knitted t-shirts that still have faint wrinkles after multiple steams, it probably has something to do with the production of the garment, not the steamer."
2,"Okay, but not great","I tested this out as soon as I got it and was not thrilled with the results. The steamer barely took the wrinkles out of a satin shirt after I used almost the entire container of water. The product might work better on cotton or a sturdier fabric. In a pinch, if you have the time to go over the garment numerous times this item is for you. From what I have read this is one of the best of the travel garment steamers. Maybe my expectation were a little to high.Pros-Easy to use-price (same product at Sharper Image for lots more)Cons-Helped but didn't get all the wrinkles out"
5,Great Steamer,"I love this steamer, a lot of steam comes out and gets all the wrinkles out. Very good purchase."
4,"It's good, just good.","Pro: well-made, attention to details, made in usa.Con: amount of steam is about the same as cheapies at walmart.What can I say??? it includes a wrench to tighten the hose and the wrench got a little piece of magnet so you can hide it at the bottom of the steamer. Quite handy when you need it. Craftmanship is superb. This tells me the manufacturer has invested a lot of time in R&D;, QA/QC.I'm one of those who always want bigger, more power so the amount of steam coming out is a bit less than I would expect from a 1300W machine. Other than that, I love it a lot."
3,Jiffy J-2000,I got my Jiffy delivered todayPros:- It is very well built the quality can be seen- easy to assembleCons:- Without a proper headboard it is difficult to control the shirt hanging and at the same time make sure you hands are away from the steam- I deliberately wrinkled one of my shirts certain area and then used the steamer it is not that easy and definitely not done in one swip you have to do it 2-3 times in one area so it gets done but not crisp wrinkles fades away but they don't disappear- It decreases the Ironing time by half but again it cannot replace ironing- for the price I think it is worth but since I might return it back as I cannot justify paying 2-3 times more than a good Iron
5,Amazing!!,"This is the best steamer by far. I've tried other products and was hesitant to purchase this one, but I'm so glad I did. It heats up fast, and within seconds the wrinkles are out. It even worked on my curtains --something my other steamer and iron couldn't do. I'm going to by this steamer again & give as gifts...i know they will thank me!"
5,This is a wonderful steamer,This steamer is ready to go to work quickly and does a nice job. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it.
5,Best steamer that I've owned.,"This is the 3rd steamer I've owned and I anticipate it'll be the last. All the parts on the Jiffys are replaceable and it appears pretty simple to take apart and perform maintenance on it. I'm really impressed by the build quality. It's not the prettiest thing, however, when is a steamer supposed to be? I've previously owned a Conair and Rowenta. Both failed to last for any period of time due to the hard water in our area. I've had this Jiffy for over 6 months now and it has exceeded my expectations with it's performance and build quality."
1,one week wonder,"I received my jiffy steam iron in a very short time.Was so excited I unpacked it that day, put everything together and started ironing imediatelyIt worked a treat.Unfortunately the next time i turned on the steamer it didnt work and hasnt worked since.Dont think i will purchase from the internet for electrical goods again as you have no recourse to take the product back to the shop."
1,Regret buying this,"This is not an inexpensive product. But I read many positive reviews from Amazon's US site and decided to take the plunge. I've used it about 5 times in the last 2 years. It now just sits in the basement collecting dust.Honestly, I can make my clothes look better by putting them in the dryer for a few minutes. An actual iron is the best option, though, in my opinion.Definitely not recommended."
2,Not a iron,"After read all the good review, I bought it.After the first try, I returned it.The bottom line is that it does not work well enough to replace the iron.It feels like a car can only run 45 miles per hour and can not get on high-way.Do you still want to buy the car?IMHO, can't use this to replace iron. So I return it...."
2,IT does not even come closer to what you can do wih iron and it is not quicker,"Besides that my steamer was dripping when in use according to the instructions ,I found it to be also very weak in steam production which reflects the quality of the final result.It can not iron any kind of material as flawlless as the iron would.It could be used for rough and unprecise ironing but would never produce the crisp look I am going to for all my ironing needs.The steaming hose is too short especially if you try to steam a hanging drapes. The attached poll for hanging clothes is too short and I had to bend in orger to steam the lower parts of a shirt.You would need something to support the garmet from the back while steaming."
4,Much better than ironing!,"I like it so far. It's still new and I haven't used it a lot, but the few times I have it's much better than ironing. It does take a little practice to get good results. I recommend using a sturdy hanger, and for those a little uncoordinated (like me) wear a glove on the hand not holding the steamer. I was moving the garment while steaming and wasn't careful about wear I placed my hand and burned myself. It puts out impressive steam and does the job. Just be cautious, read the directions carefully and take care of the product as instructed."
5,Jiffy Steamer,I have one myself and just gave as a gift to someone. They love it! It's great for steaming suits/silks and almost anything that requires dry cleaning. So much easier than ironing. I use it all the time!
4,Great for those who don't like to iron,"Very expensive, but works really well and will make your life easier. At first, it can seem difficult to use, but after a few uses I had good results. Worth it."
2,Buy an iron,This is great for sensitive clothes. If you can use an iron...do it. It will save you a lot of money and works a lot better.
5,She loves it!,"I bought this for a friend after hearing her go on about how nice it would be to have a steamer. I just asked her what she thought of it ad her reply was, ""love it, love it, love it"". And she has used steamers before. This one is great. One of the best gifts I ever bought, for someone who was spending way to much time ironing. Some things will always need an iron though."
5,so far so good,"i bought it in costco 6 months ago and the price is about 119.99+tax with free shipping, i dont remeber the exactly price but i m sure it s lower than amazon.the machine is very good, i m very pleased with my pruchase.some people say their machine will leaking later, i think that s because they did not tighten the screws properly."
3,Sturdy steamer,"I purchased the steamer to replace a cheap one I'd loved, but had died after only a year of use. That one, at it's best, created a lot of steam and worked great. This one is sturdy and well built, but doesn't seem to produce the same oomph. It works--just slower, without much pressure to the steam. I use distilled water, and it's still practically brand new, and seems to be functioning appropriately, just without the big steam I'm used to. I also find it strange that there's not a dedicated resting place for the steamer wand. I hook it over the top pole, but it just kinda hangs there. My old one had a positive hook and slot. Honestly, I've not used it all that much yet, and I hope as it breaks in, the steam pressure increases."
5,Great Product - just what we were looking for,Assembled in minutes. sturdy. Heats up fast. works great. exactly what we where looking for. had it for a couple of months so can't comment on long term but it's much like a nice room vaporizer we had years ago that died due to a build up of deposits from the water. I'm using distilled water in this and hopefully it'll last for years
2,6 out of 10 wrinkles removed!!!,"I'm not sure if the steamer works well because this is my first one. I might not even be any good at steaming because I can't seem to make my clothes look smooth and I keep burning my fingers. The unit, although easy to put together is a monster in the closet. It takes up most of the space in there. The rod doesn't seem to hold the hanger all that well and I feel like I'm chasing my clothes all around it while burning not only my finger, but also my legs because of the super stiff hot hose. I only wish I hadn't thrown out the original box, because I can't return it now."
4,Bachelor let down,"I was hoping to reduce the number of times that a shirt goes to the cleaners. The product works as advertised, but its difficult to steam the wrinkles away. It works best on the no-iron shirts, but it seems that an iron would be just as effective. The other detractor is that you cannot control the steam - once it heats up, the steam just pours out and after doing a few shirts, the small laundry room's windows begin to fog over.Bottom line - As far as steamers go, it works very well, but if you're a guy looking to touch up shirts in lieu of taking them to the cleaners then an iron works as well or better."
2,These steamers leak,"I have owned four Jiffy steamers in the past five years of owning a retail store. I have had to throw away almost one a year, and am through with them. Three out of the four steamers leak from the bottom of the steamer or from an overflowing water container. They are a bit cheap, and I am on to try another brand. Wouldn't recommend them."
2,Customer service is confused,"This company has been sending me ""order processing verification"" notices for a week. I tried to call them, only to enter the maze of their customer service telephone system, which is incomprehensible. I received another notice today. No matter, really. The item arrived six days ago."
5,Just as good as the older model,"This is the second Jiffy Steamer I have owned. The first one was a J-2 model (same steamer just a gallon jug that sits on top and is aluminum). It lasted over 9 years without ever being cleaned out, and still works like new. This one is a little lighter and a plastic housing, holds a little less water but steams just as good. I have read several reviews, this is not supposed to get rid of the iron, it really helps out on certian types of materials or little kids clothes that are to small for the iron board."
4,it's ugly but it does the job,"This steamer works well. I can't compare it to another bc I've never owned another brand. It is good for especially all the polo shirts an tshirts, I do not use it for my husbands shirts, a normal iron gives a much better result. I owned one in the country I lived before, had to sell it bc in the US they use 110 volt. I gave it a try to only use the iron, but ended up only doing my husbands shirts and send the kids to school with wrinkled school uniform polo shirts. So about 5 weeks after the move I bought the steamer again. It looks like it hasn't been updated since 1920. I love it that it is on wheels so you can take it with you to steam anywhere."
3,Jiffy Steamer J-2000 didn't live up to my dreams,"I thought that I could say ""goodbye"" to the iron & ironing board forever. It isn't that good. It works well on fabrics like T-shirts, but not so well on stiff cotton shirts. Items must be fairly wrinkle-free to start with.It isn't all I had hoped it would be."
3,Jiffy Steamer J2000,"Very good for removing wrinkles from clothing. However, it has a tendency to spit water occasionally which causes spotting on dry cleaned shirts."
4,Fine Clothes Steamer,I'm very pleased with this steamer. Assembled easily. Works well. Hose could be a bit longer for me but is a minor thing.People who say they burned themselves with this did not take proper precautions. You have to know that steam is very hot. Steam goes through fabric so don't put your hands behind where you're steaming. Simple.
3,"Less a problem with the product, more an issue with the seller.",I received the product today via amazon. The reservoir had water in it which makes me believe that it is a used or returned product when my expectation was i was buying new. Also the customer photos above do not match the item exactly. The item head is plastic not metal. This actually may be better but I generally think of plastic as cheaper and an indication of lower quality when compared to metal parts. I would address these issues directly with the seller but amazon does not provide a link that is easy to find for communication about the product. So if you are like me you may not want to buy a product that is not necessarily new at retail price and does not match the photo description. Especially if you can not easy communicate your concerns with the seller.
5,Simply Awesome,"I had it out of the box and steaming shirts and a blouse in under 10 minutes. Great craftsmanship, love the brass fittings, nice touch with the valve on the water tank. VERY sturdy pole, perfect height, flexible hose. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time."
5,Fabulous steamer,"This steamer is fabulous. I had been looking at steamers in general for a very long time and reading their reviews. I tried a friend's steamer of another brand, but didn't like it. I use a commercial Jiffy steamer at work and this sold me on Jiffy. The model I bought heats up fast and steams out wrinkles quickly. I love my Jiffy steamer."
4,No brainer,I don't like to iron. This is a good investment for me to quickly make my clothes presentable to wear. Steams fast and steady. No complaints.
2,not powerful,"The steam is not powerful and the unit leaks. I thought Jiffy was a good brand. Maybe it is, but this steamer has let me down."
5,Great steamer!,"We got this steamer to replace one that broke. We LOVE it! The steam comes out steadily, not in spurts like our previous one, so steaming is very efficient. The hose gets very hot, though, and you need to make sure that you give it enough time to heat up before starting to steam anything. Otherwise, the steam does come out in spurts & can be annoying since it won't take out wrinkles.The pole is very convenient and the water tank lasts for quite a while, despite its small size."
4,So far.....so good.,I have been a long time user of the good ole' iron and have been pleasantly surprised how easy the steamer is to use. I have only had the unit for slightly over one month and everything works great. Easy to assemble and easier to use. I definitely recommend this steamer to first time users.
2,Meh.,"Being a westerner who's lived in Ghana and read many immigrant narratives, I had high hopes.Meh. The language was too simplistic, the ideas too cliche. He tries to reach beyond common myths, but he falls short. The author lost my sympathy in his search for a self that doesn't exist. I skimmed most of it because I was so bored, waiting for something interesting."
5,Bootmen is mesmerizing!,"Stumbled across Bootmen channel surfing on Saturday morning! Wow what fun! My whole family got hooked into watching it. A great ""story"" similiar to ""October Sky"" or ""Billy Elliot"" along with the dancing! I decided I had to buy this so I could watch it over....and over. Plus watching Adam Garcia is not difficult! He's a hunk! How come we havn't seen more of this guy? Certainly not a multi-million dollar production but well worth my time and money!"
5,totally awesome,Great family entertainment & should appeal to all ages. Very entertaining and the dancing is great and storyline and acting very good as well.
4,A Toe-Tapping Good Movie,"""Bootmen"" tells the story of two brothers(Sam Worthington and Adam Garcia)with two very different dreams.The tap choreography is original and nicely done.If you liked ""Footloose"",you'll love ""Bootmen""!"
3,Australian Country Affairs,"Depicting some relicts of then historically required masculinity in modern still factually metrosexuality-obsessed Australia tells a story of working class man going wild at finding his place filled while returning after big city scene back to a native country town.Great dancing, great bodies, great show for everyone regardless of degree to what watchers enjoy same gender affairs dramas and homoeroticism at fist stage."
3,"Great music & tapping, but storyline was light.",The music and tapping was really good. The storyline could have been much stronger with character development. I enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.
4,Sam Worthington Fans may be disappointed,"""Bootmen"" stars Adam Garcia (Coyote Ugly) and Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation; Avatar; Clash of the Titans.) Worthington's role is major, but it is supportive rather then starring. His acting is typical Sam Worthington except, since this movie was filmed in his native Australia, you get to hear his Australian accent rather than his West Coast American Acting accent. Even though this movie is about tap dancing, and Adam Garcia is in his element, don't expect to see much dancing from Sam. Any dancing Sam does is in the back ground, off camera, and short lived. Because of the story line, Sam is not in the finale."
3,Nice movie! Classic!,"Great movie! Just not suited for HDTV's. Picture is low quality and pixelized. I was also billed twice! I wanted to file a dispute, but it was not worth the hassle."
4,Wonderful Introduction to Poetry,"I disagreed with the editorial reviews about this book. My children enjoyed both the beautiful photographs, as well as the poetry. It was a wonderful introduction to many well known writers, and is another keepsake book by Thomas Locker."
2,Tactics? Did I miss something?,"I have the whole series. These books are basically annotated games. If the variation of the opening you play, is not in these books, they are nearly useless. It seems like the authors used a good database and a few games to come up with a book...and you too can do the same. I think you would do much better to find a good book concerning the openings you play. A good opening book will give you coverage of tactics that occasionally arise in that opening. This series misses the point entirely. If you want a book with some extra annotated games for the opening and variations that you play, look into these books. But if you are looking for books dedicated to showing tactical themes from various opening variations...dont waste your money."
5,Buttermilk when you can't get fresh.,"Great stuff, cooks like fresh buttermilk, easy to store in freezer. Buttermilk is not readily available in Central American countries, so I cook with this."
2,Does this product contain Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH)!??,"Where does this milk powder come from? Bob's Red Mill grinds flour in the Northwest but many of their products are ""packaged"" at their location but are not made there.This buttermilk powder did nothing for me. It didn't make a better biscuit or waffle and it made my loaf bread less tasty than if I had used regular milk powder. This wasn't a successful product for me and I still have not finished the first package. I won't restock it when/if I run out of it."
2,Bob's Powder Buttermilk,I sent this to my Mother to store for emergency situations. She said it did not taste like buttermilk at all. OK for cooking but not drinking.
2,outdated,"This product is fine if you just need some basic instructions on how to start the game, but much of the information is either wrong or outdated. More updated information can be found on the internet from private sources. I would not reccommend this product unless they publish a newer version and correct the information on quests."
3,Nice book,"However, if you are looking to buy this book today...Don't. This SOE franchise is dead. This book in it's heyday was known in the game as ""The Big Book of Lies"" due to SOE changing or not following through with what they had told Prima, the publishing company. If you need a guide on how to do things from levels 1-20, it can be handy. Make sure to have a pen and white out handy to correct alot of things within, however."
5,Panasonic Winner,Love the set. I have had no problems whatsoever and I highly reccommend this inexpensive combo unit to anyone. Setting up the VCR was a breeze and the remote is user friendly.
1,VCR Problems,"This is exactly what we were looking for; however, we have the 20"" model. It sounds like the same poor quality control. Our VCR will not accept all tapes. Most of them get spat right back out at us. It has never worked right, and I have to take it back for exchange. It sounds like the replacement will most likely have the same problems. I expected much better quality from Panasonic. Our cheapy Emerson combo the kids use all day everyday continues to work flawlessly."
1,Broke after 2.5 months of use.,"This is an adorable piece of equipment but mine broke down after 2.5 months of use. ...[Now] I must inevitably go through the long and tedious process of getting it fixed via the manufacturer. It's pretty heavy...I just hope I don't drop it on my way there. If they can't fix it, I'll just have to use it as a very expensive radio. Not a good investment if you're looking for something that will last for ""at least"" 1 year."
2,Find a different teapot,"I was very disappointed in this teapot. It is extremely tiny, its glass is paper-thin and likely to break easily, and the infuser does not work well. It might be great for decorative purposes--but not for daily use. Considering the approximately $30 I spent on its purchase, I could have found a larger, sturdier version instead."
4,Just What I Was Looking For!,"I work in a store that sells these teapots for more than twice the price. I have wanted one for a while, but didn't want to pay almost $40 for it. I was excited to find this one, it is just what I wanted! It arrived quickly and was well packaged. I use it every day. Like all teapots of this style, depending on the tea you are using, it is sometimes easier to fill the pot and then drop in the diffuser with the tea already in it. (I find this to be true with Rooibos teas in particular. They are too fine and clog the slits in the diffuser.) I have been very happy with my purchase!"
2,Very thin glass -- Very small,"If it was not pretty, I would have given it a single star. Sent it right back. The glass of this teapot is so thin, it is downright scary. It is one of those, put it on a high shelf and never touch, because it's way to fragile for any real usage. 24 ounces -- really??? I didn't put any water in it, but 24 ounces would be quite, quite full."
2,Not pleased,I was not pleased with size of my tea pot. I was very excited when i placed the order but very disappointed when I received it. It's very small. Maybe a 2 cup serving or 1coffee mug.
1,Garbage,Most garbage crap I ever boght makes u more hungry and it have me a horrible alergy do not ever buy worst thing in the world I have it one star because the seller send it on time and delivery was good bt if it wasn't for that I'll put minus one
2,Not Spiegelau quality,"I have several other sets of spiegelau authentis wine, drink, and cocktail glasses. The authentis line is of much higher quality. I figured that since these were 5% lead like the authentis they would be as nice. They are not. They do not have the ""hard"" almost cut edge of the authentis and they are not nearly as fine of a crystal. The ""ring"" just isn't the same. There is a distinct seem along the base. These are fine to drink from but are no finer than what can be purchases at crate and barrell."
4,Perfect when you want class w/o being paranoid of breakage!,"These are very nice glasses..they are the perfect solution for when one needs a classy glass without bringing out the ""family jewels!""They have a nice ring when toasting, thanks to the 5% lead...and are not too expensive, since the lead content is much less than real fancy 24% leaded crystal.Yes, they do have a very, very slight seam along the stem...hardly noticeable...and certainly acceptable for a glass that costs less than $5/pc.Go for it!"
3,Adequate,"These are workable glasses - kind of heavy, with a seam down the stem - but attractive in a simple, uncluttered way. With reasonable care, they will probably last a long time."
1,I received a lemon,When I received the vcr the tapes would not go innormally. Also the power would not stay on more morethan five seconds. It was too much trouble to returnit so i threw it in the trash.
1,If you're lucky & get a good one it's fine,"I bought two of these. One has been ok but the second one would spit out any tape you fed it. Returned it immediately and got another one that did exactly the same thing. By then it was too late to return to the store so it's sitting on a shelf as a paperweight. So one of three worked. On another subject, the remote is awful - so I use an old ""Tower"" remote I got at Goodwill."
3,A disappointment for a Panasonic VCR . . .,"Mediocre play-and-record picture and sound quality, even when compared to my 10-year old, low-end Magnavox Hi-Fi VCR (claimed to contain both Philips and Panasonic components). If it were not for its good price and intended use by my kids, this Panasonic VCR would have gone back to the retail store where I bought it. The Panasonic reputation for quality VCRs is slipping with this model."
3,For the price it is decent.,"Do not expect much reliability from this player. I have two of these vcrs for about three months now and I have not had any problems yet, they work fine. However their built quality is poor and they feel very flimsy, but for [the price] you cannot ask too much. If it breaks I will get a new one. I had a JVC before this one and it was way worse than the Panasonic. The loading mechanism in the JVC was terrible and some tapes kept getting stock in there. The loading system in the Panasonic is much smoother and it takes any tapes I throw at it. I have also another Panasonic which is 6 years old (it has a blue display instead than the green one) and it has a higher built quality than these new models. Unfortunately most electronic components today are designed and built to break easily in order to sale more units. Gone are those days where reliability was the most important aspect, it just isn't profitable anymore. Overall: GOOD to FAIR."
1,Your electronic products need better descriptions,How do you expect people to buy from you when you descriptions/specifications of your electronics aren't shown with the product? Now I have to go elsewhere and will probably buy from someone else.
2,no different than previous one I had,"Well where do I begin. My VCR was bought to replace an existing one of the same brand PV 7450 HiFi. My old one would have sound problems, similar to static, if I tried to play something that was recorded in HiFi, but doesn't sounds that way in mono. I currently have a 4661 I use as well that hasn't had any problems. Both machines were nicey and so was this one. When I got this one, I was surprised to find out that the sound was just as static sounding and, if not, noisier than the 7450 I replaced. I'm anxiously waiting for DVD recorders to come down in price."
5,Another triumph,"Seven years after Spaceship Zero, The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets deliver another Lovecraftian powerhouse. From the full throttle rock of Blackout, to the mellow groove of Return to Melanesia, to the sinister Egyptian underpinnings of Nyarlathotep, this is hands down the most musically diverse Thickets album to date, and yet it maintains a strong theme throughout. Definitely one of the landmark albums of 2007."
4,Decent grinder,This grinder has worked well enough for me. The biggest problem I have with it is that the plastic lid rattles loose while grinding--so you need to hold it in place to keep it running. This is a minor deficit since most grinders need their tops held on while grinding.
1,DIED AFTER A FEW MONTHS,"MOTOR SMOKED AND DIED AFTER A FEW MONTHS. CAN'T FIND THE WARRANTY, IF THERE IS ONE. NO WARRANTY INFORMATION ON THE BOX. I USUALLY AUTOMATICALLY SAVE MANUALS AND WARRANTIES SO I'M NOT SURE IF I RECEIVED THEM."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Looks nice on the counter, does a great job grinding. But the plastic top tends to shift slightly when the machine is working. This shuts off the motor (safety switch requires the top to be in exact place). I have to hold the top in place while grinding the coffee. Annoying."
5,This is the best Blumchen album,"All the songs in this album are good. The only song that I really thought that was average was ""walk like an egytian"" but the rest are just perfect. One of my favorite is ""ich vermisse dich"" which is written by Jasmin herself and others that are stuck in my mine are ""war du ich"",""Denst du machmal noch an mich?"" and ""detektive"". Although the style has changed somewhat into a more dancier beat I highly recomend this album. In my opinion this is the best one so far since she does more singing than any other album and thats what I want to hear her sing. I got this album one week after it was released in Germany thanks to a friend in Germany who also got it autographed for me."
3,Read this before you buy!,"K, first of all Im the biggest fan of hers ever! Her combination of europop and hardcore is second to NONE! However, this album is a much more grown up album from Herzfrequnz, Verliebt and even the more mellow Jasmin. For starters, this album has 1 song which is the typical fast and hard sound we are used to. However the rest of the album is a mix of mellow dance, pop, disco and ballads. Not being able to speak German I cant appreciate all the lyrics as each song has verses and choruses unlike the earlier albums which have around 6 lines. The best tracks are Ist deine liebe echt?... To sum up, this is a more grown up sound as admitidly hard eurodance is no more =( which may be hard for some people to swallow, ie me! In my opinion her best CDs are Live in Berlin and Herzfrequenz."
3,Blumchen Turning Popish,"I first became a Blumchen fan because of their unique dance flavored, engery filled style which is prevalent throughout their first and second albums, Herzfrequenz and Verliebt. This album has a much more popish feel to it than any of its predecessors. Jasmin's voice is just as beautiful as ever, but the brilliant euro-dance/techno melodies by Paralyzer are reduced to mediocer, and to my tastes, rather bland synth accompaniments. This change in musical style first appeared in Jasmin (the 3rd album, not the singer). At the time, however, I dismissed this as merely experimenting on the part of Blumchen. It now appears this new, more mainstream, pop sound is here to stay. There are bound to be fans who will find no qualms with this album and embrace the new Blumchen sound with open arms. I suggest however, those fans who enjoyed most the orginal and uplifting hard dance mixes of Paralyzer seek new sources to satisfly their needs. Try E Nomine or Ayla."
1,Beware of defective book binding !,"The binding of this very large (and photographically nice) book came loose. I returned it to Amazon for an exchange. They promised one for some 2-3 months, then told me they couldn't."
1,ludicrous male self-reflection,"It never ceases to amaze me how males generalize male issues. Are there any woman who has ever written a book on homosexuality the implications of which solely refers to women? Male vanity is beyond ridiculous. This little masculinist book is interesting however, not from the intended male, but human standpoint. American society, notoriously women-hating and male-dominated, has been deeply influenced and shaped by males who have sex with men and prefer male homosexual and homosocial - i.e women-free - environments. Anyone surprised?"
1,False advertising will get you to buy this book,"""The Wordsworth Dictionary of Film Quotations""subtitled: ""The essential guide to the wit, glamour and wisdom of the movies""THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE QUOTE FROM A MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE BOOK!I say again... I have not seen a single quote from a movie in the entire book!I know Amazon.com has absolutely no control over the contents of a title, and I am aware that I must bear the burden of this purchase, as I am responsible for researching titles before I buy them. But you, the reader & potential buyer, must be made aware of this deception so that you are forewarned as to what you are getting. This book contains approx. two thousand MAGAZINE & NEWSPAPER quotations by people who are in some way affiliated with Hollywood. Even the cover photo shows a film-still of Rudolph Valentino! But alas, there are no movie quotes. Stay away from this one unless you know you want it for what it is.Thanks to Amazon.com for inviting me to submit a review of this title."
1,Turkey Lovers Be Warned!,"The product review above promises that this roaster has the capacity to to handle a 22 lb. turkey. IT DOES NOT. In fact, it cannot even handle a 20 lb. turkey. And I think an 18 pounder might be pushing its limits."
5,every song on here is great of course,"what else could you expect. it's a compilation of some of the replacements best song, with a big emphasis on SOME. The Replacements are a band where every album counts, because every fan holds one song dear to their heart more than another. Let it Be, Tim and Pleased to Meet Me are 3 perfect albums, all the other ones are great too, i would recommend starting with one of those. But the 2 new songs, particularly Message to the BOys are just great. Alot like Westerberg solo stuff, but with Tommy and Chris playing along as well. The fans will of course buy the thing because of the new songs(i did) and new comers will probably wind up buying all their other albums, because you'll most likely love every song on here, and EVERy song on here is a gem, so you'll want more and more until you're obsessed with the band. Greatest band of all time"
5,kodak easy share,This is the easiest and most informative digital camera I have ever used. I love the fact that you can turn it over and have others see the display in the correct picture position. The pictures are very clear and true to life.
4,nice pics,the camera looks very good with the dual lens technology and has amazing 10X optical zoom and can well fit in the pocket
5,I love this 10x zoom slim camera,"I purchased this camera in September of 2006 to use on vacations. I have a larger 10x zoom digital camera but wanted something I can slip into a small bag or pocket. I epected to give up quality of pictures when I down-sized, but not so. This 10x optical zoom really works with the clarity of my other camera in most situations. I love the many features it offers such as the panoramic feature that stitches the images right in the camera not later on your computer, or the screen flips to show the picture upright in any direction whe you review pics. Pictures in low light are difficult to still, and the LCD screen (which I love the large size) is difficult to see in bright light. These are problems that are common in even some of the most exspensive cameras. This camera is VERY much worth the money"
5,Most impressive camera I've owned,"The lag time is low, the color is good and the resolution is high. This is a great camera. I love all of the little extras added in such as how it always rotates your pictures to be right side up, there is a panorama function allowing you to stitch together 3 shots.Highly recommened. I am buying a second one right now since I just had mine stolen. Best review out there, I'm buying the same camera twice."
5,Excellent product for the money!!,"This is an awesome camera,the pictures are incredible,even on the sun light!! and amazing zoom.i check my photos on the apple 30inch dysplay and i can't see the pixeles of the photos at that size,this thing takes really big high quality photos,and vivid colors!Don't waist your time choosing a camera this one is the best!!!"
4,EVERYTHING is perfect except one thing...,"I'm totally satisfied and it's great, the reason why I rate it 4 stars is because the lens cover sometimes get stuck and you have to push it a bit with your finger in order to make it open, but sometimes it's totally the opposite, it becomes loose and it it could open if you slightly touch the cover. After all, I don't start it before I make sure that it's not gonna stick. I highly recommend it. Thanks Amazon, they're the best."
2,Disappointed and Returned,I was really disappointed in this camera. From the moment I took it out of the package until I shipped it back I really didn't find anything I liked about it. The black finish is very hard to keep clean and it feels funny in your hands. No matter how many pictures I took it took several times to get one picture that wasn't blurry. The 10x isn't all that it is cracked up to be either. Unless you can stand still and not breath the picutre will be blurry. I do not recommend this camera to anyboby. Very disappointed.I did get a full refund and I purchased another Easyshare camera that I just love. They look a lot alike but they are nothing alike. If you really have your heart set on this one I would recommend finding it in a store to touch and feel before purchasing.
3,It is not what I expected,"I bought this camera because the reviews and the specifications. It is not what I expected, I don't know if it is because I haven't learnt how to use it, but I hardly can get the pictures focused. I had another 3 MP camera that I missed so badly now."
5,The best camera yet!!!,"I have had this camera for a little over a year now, and it always amazes me when i use it the pictures are very nice for a point and shoot and batt life is incredable to say the least.took a 4 day cruise and over 300 pic and short movies, I never had to charge it once.I had all the Sonys and Canons this is my favorite camera,!"
4,kadak V610 review,"this camera is fantastic for taking pictures of standing still objects. scenery, buildings, people, etc. if you want to take pictures of wildlife or moving objects it is a little difficult. it takes a while to get used to using the screen instead of a viewfinder. also when it is sunny it is hard to see the screen so you can't be sure of your picture. overall i like the camera and enjoy using it. fairly user friendly."
5,Packed with technology,"This camera does everything, it is impressive. The bluetooth is a plus. The sound quality of videos is great, I take videos at local band shows and being really close to the speakers doesn't ruin the sound quality. Images come out great, specially if you choose the correct setting. Auto setting does it for you too."
3,Bright Green Light,"This camera takes great pictures and has all the features that I expected, size, 10x optical zoom, etc...BUT, there is one major problem - it shoots off an extremely bright green light as you are taking pictures and my kids have, in no uncertain terms, told me not to use it to take their picture when they are in things like a school performance. As a result of this, I am probably going to sell it and look for something different."
5,The Best,"This is the best digital camera I have seen. It is as good as a professional camera. It dos black and white photos as well as color. With a 2 gig memory chip it holds hundreds of pictures. And, it takes panoramic as well as close up photos. It dos it all we just love it."
1,V610 Kodak,"Loved the concept of this camera...small, 10x zoom and sleek looking, BUT the first one lasted 3 days, had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week. Both stopped operating completely. So given that kind of problem I do not recommend this camera."
3,"good camera, this one was faulty...","The one I ordered from amazon arrived with a malfunctioning lens cover. Amazon did make the return painless, although I did had to contact them after I noticed that the credit issued was not for the full amount. They did make the correction immediately. Other than the lens cover issue, this is a great camera."
3,Not Impressed,"I am used to shooting with a 12x optical zoom camera already, but I wanted a ""point and shoot,"" with a large zoom as well. The first frustration I had before I even shot my first image, was the ""surface"" of the camera! It showed every finger print and smudge, and it drove me crazy. I initially loved the ""look"" of the camera (being black!) but, I did not know that there was a texture to it that required constant wiping off. With that said! I took ""comparison"" shots (in nature) with my two cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ20 versus Kodak V610) and was VERY disappointed in the lack of color brilliance (V610)! I was so disappointed that I sent the camera back for a refund (in which they were GREAT about!!!) I am in the woods alot -- my photography is scenery and wildlife; so maybe the camera would be okay for people shots? I did not keep it long enough to try. It just did not serve my purposes."
5,Butterfly Photo - great customer service,"If you are getting your camera from Butterfly Photo, you can rest assure they have the best customer service. Isaac Mizrahi of Butterfly photo was a great help to me. After ordering a 5x the optical from another Amazon provider, and having to return it due to a defect (of which they offered no help)In a nutshell, this Kodak camera is the best, but it's becomes PERFECT when you get it from Butterfly Photo.Aloha from Hawaii!"
2,"Nice Package, Terrible Performance","Nice package, terrible performance....not exactly what you want to hear after spending nearly $400.00.If you are looking for a camera that can take clear, detailed, sharp images, this is NOT the camera for you!If you want a camera that can take nice pictures indoors with lamp lighting, this is NOT the camera for you!If you want to takes pictures of your kids or dogs, this is NOT the camera for you!If you want to capture a special moment on the first try, this is NOT the camera for you!!I wish I knew what camera would do all the above mentioned things....if so I would buy it in a heartbeat.The only positive thing about this camera is the small size.The LCD displays grainy images of the picture you have just taken, no way to tell if it's any good until you get it on the computer.The battery lasts for about 20 pictures.The images are soft, not crisp.You CANNOT crop much until you are pixilated.This camera SUCKS."
2,Falling appart.,"This camera worked perfect for a couple of years and then started to fall apart - literally. Some little screws fell off and camera started to lose parts. Repair would cost more than new camera, so I ought new one, not KODAK this time."
2,"Second Kodak, and will be my last!","I had purchased the Kodak V410 and was very happy with it. It lasted for about a year and then the rear display stopped working.Being based in the Bahamas, I decided it wasn't worth the red tape of trying to get it repaired.So I decided to purchase the then new V610.I was satisfied with this camera also, but then the Gremlins started to show up again.My camera will no longer focus on anything!!!Still shots are blurry unless you use a tripod, and the video.... boy don't get me started.Since this is my second lemon from Kodak I will be searching elsewhere for a point and shoot.Just my 5cents."
5,dont buy it...,"**UPDATE AS OF 4/10/07**It died on me. Didnt even last 7 months. Kodak wouldn't honor the warranty, and they offered me a $180 repair bill to get it fixed and shipped back.No thanks Kodak. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.There are FAR better cameras for similar or less money than this. Shop elsewhere."
5,Panoramic Revolution......,"this camera (like it's cousins, the Kodak V570, and V705) takes three pictures and stitches them together IN CAMERA! No computer is needed. just snap a shot, and take another two--the camera's LCD lines the shots up for you. wait ten seconds and all 3 shots are stitched together for a s-u-p-e-r wide panoramic. also, the V610 is the world's smallest 10x optical zoom - pocket sized, a great convenience when you want to zoom without a huge lens.just see the samples above, or for a wider angle for scenery, etc., look for the Kodaks dual lens V570 or the new V705."
2,Bad power unit,"I am in the process to have the power unit replaced second time. After charging with the AC adapter, I could not turn it on. I sent it in for repair and was told that power PCB was bad and had to be replaced. I got it back and recharged it again, it overheated the camera and it stopped working again. So disappointed."
5,First Digital,Got this camera because a friend had a similar one. The blue tooth feature is just great. You need a memory card to make if you want to take video's and store a lot of photos. The video's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size. All in all a great buy.
1,This item must be imitation did not last at all,Try to get an original Sony Lamp because the one I got here must be imitation only lasted about 3 1/2 months just enough for the warranty to be expired. it must be defected because It did not gave me any warning at all.
5,Great for chicken,NESCO 6 QT ROASTER OVEN W/ PORCELAIN - WHITEThis is just super for a large or any other size chicken.. Great for heating anything for a small family. Dont have to use the oven or a big roaster
4,"Great product once ""seasoned""","I've only used my roaster once, but the chicken I made in it came out excellent! When I think roasted chicken I think of it dry but this was SO juicy and good. I have yet to try other recipes in it, but so far it's great just for roasting.The only issue I had with it was ""seasoning"" it. You have to plug it in and let it heat up for about an hour. Try 3... and in a VERY ventilated garage because the smell that came from this device was horrible! I was told that's normal and that it goes away, which it did. It's just not something you want to do in a smaller, non ventilated area.I gave it 4 stars simply because of the ""seasoning"" process. But otherwise, it's a great product and I look forward to using it a lot more."
1,Worthless Junk!!!!,The vendor was top notch and delivered the item quickly as promised. My problem is with the products quality. Do not buy these low quality pieces of junk. Save your hard earned money. The quick disconnects do not make positive connections and blow off when the water is turned on. The metal is low quality and both of the nozzles are broken off the deck from debris being kicked up by the blades. This product should not have ever been released for sale to the public.
4,Wash deck attachment,The wash deck shipped quickly and was exactly as described. I used it for the first time today and it worked as it should have. My only concern is the durability of the plastic quick connect. I would have gladly paid more for a metal hose connector.
5,Family Rescue,I ordered this movie for a family member. It was shipped to the family member quickly and was in great condition. The price was also great along with shipping.
1,Pitiful......,I bought this book because I knew some of the people involved in the GOLD CLUB. The book lacks professionalism throughout. Yes I realize that DIVA was not well educated but it looks like someone could have put this book together better. I guess I just expected more. I can not imagine the book holding the interest of anyone outside of the Atlanta area where we saw so much about the Gold Club on the news. To sum up this book in one word.......SLEAZE.
1,I LOVE MYSELF,"I got this book to get the inside deal on the trial, etc. However what I got was a book telling me how wonderful, beautiful, honest, and what a wonderful friend and mother this woman was. I have never read a book by someone that is so in love with themself.I personally got a little nauseated at her descriptions of how much everyone was in love with her. When she says how beautiful everyone thought she was I am sure it was due to the drinks they had. I kept looking at her picture. Beautiful? Not in this day of Jenna and the rest."
1,The Ego Trip,Anyone can get a book published these days as long as there's sex and famous people to rat on. Bush twisted the story around to make out like she was really such a goody 2 shoes in a business where sleaze rules.
3,Editing ? What editing ??,"The good = Easy read and some intersting stories. I was amazed how Ms. Bush could remember such details as how much money customers spent and what she was wearing when she was with them.The bad = I don't think an editor read over the manuscipt before sending it to the printers because the book is full of spelling errors, sentence fragments and just terrible grammar.Ms. Bush names several athletes as ""friends"" then proceeds to mispell their names. How friendly can you be if you can't even spell their name correctly ?The book jumped around too much from chapter to chapter. It started off in the beginning then jumped to 1996 then back to her days as a teenager then to 1998 then to when she had kids then her bad marriage. It didn't flow at all and followed no timetable which, was confusing.All in all, I'm glad to know that things have worked out and she has survived all the hardships in her life. God Bless."
1,Leave it coded,"I love history, Stonehenge and Donald Sutherland.Normally I would be in front of the tv and taking it all in but if I hear ""Parker Pearson"" one more time I think I will scream.The archeologist in this video is NEVER--at least not more than 30 minutes into it--referred to as Dr Pearson, Mr Pearson or just plain Pearson!Parker Pearson obviously likes the sound of his full name--or at least his first and surnames--and this makes the entire program sound contrived.Quite frankly 35 minutes into the program I really don't care what Parker Pearson believes.If you are easily annoyed--STAY AWAY! If you are not easily annoyed but can be annoyed by pompous self servitude that makes it clear you will never and I mean never mistake Parker Pearson for another archeologist named Pearson--STAY AWAY!!However, if you enjoy hearing Donald Sutherland say ""Parker Pearson"" 2, 3, 4 times per minute then you will love this program and you are welcome to it!"
2,Not a very good unit,"I owned this particular unit for about six months and was pretty satisfied with the performance of it, until a tape became stuck in the VCR. Manufacturer's warranty only covered labor for 90 days......Apparently it had a defective carrier and this was a pretty common and expensive problem. Warranty would cover the part but not labor - needless to say it is cheaper to buy another VCR.The VCR's are pretty low end on all of these Panasonic units (and probably other brands too). At least the TV still works.If I were to purchase a new unit I would not recommend the TV/VCR combos. You are probably better off buying individual components - since VCR's are so cheap now anyway..."
4,A PIECE OF HISTORY,"I loved John Newburn's new book, ""23 - Navy Air in Korea."" It not only gives autobiographical insight about the experiences (often thrilling) of pilots during the Korean War, but also it inserts us into the time period - the reader feels keenly the character of these pilots and the type of men they expected themselves to be, not seen as much in our current times. Mr. Newburn is a new writer - I hope to see more from him!"
3,These are pearls,"Although the picture looks like metal beads and description states sterling silver, these are pearls."
5,Perfect Pearl Bracelet,"Pearl Bracelet was bought for my 4yr old goddaughter for her birthday. Everyone at her party loved it, especially her. Thank you for such a nice product. [...]"
5,The title of the book says it all.,"If you really want to end your migraines, you will follow the guidelines in this book. I have had migraine headaches all my whole life and for the past 7 years I have averaged 75 migraines a year. During the past three months, following my review of this book, I have had only 6 migraines and I feel great. With the help of a nutritionist, I have developed my own menu, or food schedule, which is simple to follow and eliminates the items Rodolfo Low recommends. It was not easy at first to follow but the alternative is much less desirable. The result is that my new menu has definitely worked for me. Good Luck!"
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book was the reason I stopped having migraines which I had had all my life. I had 4 a month that lasted 3 days each. This book, explaining that migraine sufferers are hypoglycemic and must give up refined sugar, helped me give up the sugar that had always been bad for my system and led me to a life free of migraines and a way of eating that keeps my blood sugar level normal and me calm yet energetic."
5,Excellent product easy to set up,"I had other Panasonic VCR's and this one works fine. Arrived in excellent condition as advertised. I have older tv's without the extra wires (red,yellow, white). Simply plug in the cable and the other end into the tv and you're ready to go. You There was no manual, but by simply using 'Program"" button, you can easily figure it out. The recordings are clear and crisp. For the money,it is well worth it. I'd purchase another one if necessary. My only problem is finding VCR tapes to use. I stilll have a small supply and tape overs are good enough for taping a tv show that I missed."
3,NOT SO HOT,"THE PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE A TRACKING ADJUSTMENT, AND CAME WITHOUT ITS OWN REMOTE CONTROLLER, BUT INSTEAD WITH THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE STANDARD REMOTE-CONTROLLER (WHICH REMAINS IN ITS PLASTIC WRAPPING, UNUSED - IT IS OF SUCH POOR QUALITY).THIS IS MY FIRST PURCHASE THROUGH AMAZON, AND WILL PROBABLY BE MY LAST, AS THERE IS NO QUALITY-CONTROL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RETURNED BUT IS NEEDED FOR RESEARCH OF OLD VIDEOS."
1,Broken in 4 months of light use,"The VCR gives an average quality picture, but broke within four months of light use (after the 90 day warranty expired, of course). The picture suddenly went bad on one tape, and after this other tapes we tried were almost unwatchable. We cleaned it with a cleaning tape, etc. but it never worked right after that. We only watched a couple tapes a week with it, so its lifetime is about 35 tapes. You get what you pay for, so I guess I shouldn't be suprised by the low quality."
2,Ate my tapes..........,"I had a lot of problems with this VCR. It had a tendency to be picky about which kinds of cassettes it would accept, and more often than not, would just spit them back out. It finally broke down after less than two years, not accepting any cassettes at all, but still managing to chew up the tape inside. Grrrrrrrrr............."
4,Good Effort!,"This is a very good product that fleshes out the actic. WotC has spent a lot of time lately trying to flesh out various aspects of ""standard"" campaigns (likely because the aging professionals who play their games have less and less time for extraneous things--like building campaign worlds), and this product does a fine job of helping out DMs and players alike. It has a number of fairly interesting prestige classes, and a some very good feats. The neantherdal race is a very interesting PC race. The spells are pretty good, though rather standard and typical. Frostburn really shines, however, in its new monsters, and there are quite a few of them. Unlike some complaints, I felt the writers did a pretty good job of fleshing out the effects of extreme cold (though, perhaps, not good enough--but it's difficult to really know what -50 degree temperatures can do, especially week after week, unless you've lived in them, like I have). I highly recommend Frostburn."
2,Slightly Better than Terrible,"Okay, judging from all the other reviews it's obvious that I'm not the only person who didn't like this book. Since Ferrigno has written several other books that are quite good, it truly does seem like this is one that just got cranked out in a hurry without much thought. The plot is weak, the characters mostly unlikeable...I found very little to like about this book at all. In fact, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the villianous character called The Angel was rather amusing. All in all, I would say avoid this book and buy one of Ferrigno's other novels. This one is just really, really bad...as my title says, it's only slightly better than terrible."
1,stone freeze,"The characters are not developed, not a nail-biting, engulfing novel to say the least. After the first episode in the novel with the hot-tub, there is no excitement, and you are forced to burn through the pages looking for some sort of intriguing turn of events."
1,a real disappointment,"""There are two bodies in Nick's hot tub"" begins the blurb on the cover of this book. Since I was going to be spending the rest of the day at home recovering from a root canal, I thought this book would be the perfect mindless accompaniment to laying on the couch and eating pain medication. I should have requested another root canal instead. Muddy plot, interchangeable characters that you ultimately don't care about anyway, unconvincing sex scenes, and a laughable prose style made this book extremely disappointing, and not the page-turner I had hoped for."
5,The best use of space!,"I love this item. I was so happy that I could purchase this through Amazon.com and Ritz Camera, because the manufacturer did not have it on their website. This is my second, and I hope another is available when this one dies. The toaster built in is so great for people with little counter space, and it works very well."
1,daewoo products are junk,All Daewoo Electronics products are total junk. Parts are not available from Daewoo or anywhere else because they are a totally bogus company. Do not waste your money on anything made by Daewoo.
4,A Reasonable Compilation,"The original title for this series was, I believe, called ""Decades."" It does a reasonable job of capturing the tempo of that time and is presented in the style and format of the period. It is an interesting look, overall."
4,Pretty Good Sixties Retrospective,"Narrated by Peter Jennings, ""The Fabulous Sixties"" is a DVD set consisting of ten episodes, one for each year from 1960 to 1969. The series recalls the most important events of the decade, such as the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Great Society, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the 1969 Moon landing, and the assassinations of JFK, MLK, and RFK. The DVD set also looks back at some sports stories and cultural events such as the arrival of the Beatles, Woodstock, and the hippie movement at Haight-Ashbury. This series seemed more tendentiously liberal than its successorThe Sensational 70s, but if you can get past that bias, this series is a solid look back at a pivotal decade."
1,A cynical look at the 60's!,"The Fabulous SixtiesI thought the production quality was poor (some attempt at a digital clean-up would have been a good thing) . Some episodes repeated themselves - 1962 was 61' all over - repeated and so too, was 65!It's a rather jaded and cynical look back at what was a most exciting decade - it wasn't all that bad and gloomy. Peter Jennings commentary, for the most part, comes across as snide and cynical. There is a few good items amongst the dross or endless 'race riots', 'war', more 'race riots' and .... riots."
1,GREAT PERIOD - TERRIBLE PRODUCTION,"This DVD is pathetic by way of sound. The video is poor. The titling is second rate. It runs maybe six hours with perhaps thirty minutes of good viewable images.The writing for it is also inferior. In sum, it is terribly produced."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this steamer in an effort to avoid ironing. However, the steamer I received was extremely weak and did not remove wrinkles how I had hoped it would. I spent more time holding the steamer over a wrinkle than I would have if I had just ironed it. It heats up quickly, but it leaves water marks. It just doesn't seem to produce enough steam to do anything. Maybe my steamer is defective."
1,Don't waste your money on a Conair fabric steamer.,"This is the worst steamer on the market! The first one I bought, I returned when it stopped steaming after 5 minutes. The second one (the exchange for the first one) gurled, shook, did not steam and slopped water all over the floor. The third one (the exchange for the second one) was even worse than the second one as far as no steam, gurgling, shaking and water all over my floor. I contacted Conair and asked if there had been a recall on these. They said no and I should go to my local Target and buy yet another one. Thanks but three lemons later I give up. I will buy a professional brand rather than go through this aggravation. What a waste of my money and time!"
4,Still need a iron for creases,"Overall, it is good for taking wrinkles out of casual clothes. For sharp creases, you will still have to break out the iron. Works well for khakis and sweaters/shirts. I haven't tried it on curtains yet so that will be a big test. Only complaint is rod could be taller."
1,Suprised,"It worked one time then quit. I have never had a product do this before , I guess I got a lemon."
2,Worst steamer Ever,Steam is not nearly powerful enough to remove even moderately wrinkled clothes without holding the steamer over the wrinkles for a long time. Waste of money because you will end up having to buy a steamer that actually works.
3,"OK, but still use my iron","This worked, but I still use my iron and this seems to be stuck more in my closet...so, you decide.Could be excellent for steaming velvet or something like it..so it's still a keeper I guess."
3,Better than ironing...,"I got this steamer last year because I hate to iron, and I have been pretty pleased with it. It works really well on thinner fabrics like silk, rayon, thin cotton, and on knits.I use distilled water in the steamer to prevent any build-up clogs.It won't work very well on thicker fabrics (like denim), or on very wrinkly woven cotton shirts that didn't get taken out of the dryer right away. To me, it is still better than ironing."
2,Good while it lasted,"I really enjoyed this steamer in the early days. We even named it Rosie, for its robot-like appearance. However, last week (after about 1.5 years) of service, Rosie almost started a fire in my laundry room.I had noticed from time to time that the power plug would get a bit hot. But this time, I discovered black smoke eminating from the outlet ... and the machine was still producing steam, which tells me that it has insufficient short-circut protection.There is no recall that I know of, and perhaps it is a fluke, but nonetheless BE CAREFUL."
4,Steamed,Steamer was ordered and recieved in good shape. We had one just like it for 10 years and it finally died. It did a good job and we bought another. If it lasts as good as the first one we will order another. We like it!
1,Weak steam output.,The steam from this device hardly makes a difference in the fabric. The stream of steam is rather sporadic and weak. And the small nozzle is a poor delivery device to recondition the wide swatches of fabric.This thing is going straight to ebay now.
1,Don't waste your time and money,"It's the worst steamer I have ever used in my life. Please do not waste your time and money. Old-fashioned ironing will be more efficient and faster. if you really consider buying garment steamer, look for the professional models. Conair model does not have enough steam power/pressure (the pot of boling water creates more steam than this machine). The design of the steamer needs to be improved. Hose is made of soft plastic and as soon as it heats up it bends (hence preventing the flow of the steam)and gets on the way. Moreover, during the steaming, it gets extremely hot. Hose also does not shut down valve, which is very uncomfortable."
1,WATCH OUT!!!!!!,"I purchased this steamer because I am terrible at ironing and thought this would be simpler. I was wrong! I filled the tank like the instructions said and after it heated, the water started pouring out. I put a towel down, and figured it was no big deal if water leaked on the floor. When the steam came out my husband started to pick up the wand to steam his pants, unfortunately he took his pants off his body to try out the steamer and scalding hot water poured out of the wand and onto his bare leg!!!!"
3,Too small print,I thought the book would be average in size but it is compact. This is great for anyone who likes that but not for someone who needs larger print. I must have misread the dimensions ob the book.
1,Be Careful in Dealing with This Company Directly,"They've received an ""F"" rating from the Better Business Bureau. When I ordered, a representative of the company called me the next day to get my Credit Card information. My credit card was charged, but the merchandise was not sent. They do not answer any correspondence - whether e-mail or landline telephone. Be careful!"
1,Awful,"Been cooking the slow cooker since 6AM. It's now 8PM and the pulled pork is still not near cooked. In a cheap slow cooker that I also have going simultaneously, the cheap cooker had the pork done perfectly since 5 PM."
4,Roasters worked well and had no problems,"We bought these cookers to use during an office party ""chili cook-off"". Both roasters worked well and had no problems, although we only used them once so far."
5,Outstanding book.,Bought this book after going to the Pacific War Museum in Fredericksburg . Would recommend this book to any WW2 history buff.
2,Chopper Not Grinder,"Despite the description of custom grinder, this is not a grinder and does not really do custom grinds. I wanted a unit that would do coarse grind for my HourGlass coffee maker (as you would need for a percolator). However, when I set it for the grind and the amount of coffee, it still came out fine. It is a blade chopper and if you want coarse, you need to use only a little coffee and control the chopping time yourself. You can do as well with a cheaper chopper machine. If you really want custom grind you need to spend over $100."
4,Great grinder!,"I got this as a replacement for their other silver version, which I'd really liked. The idea of putting the beans in and letting it do it's thing consistently every time without having to hold it in your hand is great. And the removable basket is a great feature, too. I wanted this because it was black, but was surprised that it was bigger than their silver version, which I didn't need, but I got over it."
3,Great but not long lasting...,"I loved this product! (Notice the past tense) Although a little loud, it worked great for the 1-2 times a week we used it. After about a month, however, the motor started to smoke while in use and quickly burned out. I have contacted Hamilton Beach in regards to replacing it, we'll see what happens..."
2,"Definitely NOT ""Hands-Free""","This is a good-looking grinder, it grinds just right. I do love the removable stainless steel insert, way less of a mess. But, within perhaps a month of purchase, you can no longer ""walk away"" while the coffee grinds. The vibrations of the machine cause the plastic top to ""unlock"" and the grinding will stop. You have to stand there and hold the plastic top in the ""locked"" position if you want the grinder to finish its cycle. It is definitely NOT ""hands-free."" You don't have to hold the button down, just hold the plastic top in place. It is just like any other cheap grinder now, you have to stand there holding it, except for the fact that this one is NOT cheap! I miss being able to walk away...I don't believe I will buy this one again..."
2,not worth the money,"not satisfied, had a Braun in the past which was much easier to handle, this machine to difficult to remove cup and to grind, would not buy again"
2,Best grinder for those who don't drink coffee...,"If you only plan to drink coffee for the next month or two, buy this grinder!! It was truly one of the best and we'll miss it. One of the coolest features was the safety catch that needs to be engaged for the grinder to work. This protects your fingers from (1) getting through the sealed plastic cover, then (2) working their way over the lip of the metal grinding bowl, and (3) slipping down into the nasty metal blades. Only problem is that after a week or two you have to hold the whole apparatus to keep the latch engaged. After three or four months (if you use it every morning)the little nubs gets rubbed down so no matter what you do the grinder won't work ever again, keeping you fingers safe forever!!!!"
4,Fast & Easy,This is a great iinexpensive grinder. Its been grinding well and quick and easy. Of course there is the static cling on the first batch but after that it is not bad. For the price it's great.
1,Forget this one...,"Like another reviewer, I found this grinder wouldn't work right out of the box as the vibration of the grinder backed off the plastic cover from the locked to the unlocked position, shutting off the unit. I never ground a bean in this loser. It goes back to the store for a refund tomorrow. I'll likely buy a good German-made manual burr grinder, as I am sick of buying poorly executed Asian-made electrical appliances that end up in the land fill much too soon. Don't waste your time on low cost blade grinders-most of them are junk. Look for a good burr grinder that is either manual or electric."
3,Could be Better!,"I bought this grinder based upon mainly reviews here - I like it, BUT wish I had actually bought another. FIRST - the cord provided is WAY too SHORT, it sets on my kitchen counter under my cabinets, thus, one, like most, have to pull it out to use it....I had to attach a lousy extension cord so I could pull it out maybe another 6"". SECOND - the plastic cup\cap on the unit must be engaged and then twisted kind of hard to the right to ""lock"" before you hit the GRIND button....I found almost immediately that IF I did not put my arm/hand on top of the ""cap\cup"" that the ginding would usually vibrate the cap enough so it would shut off the grind prematurely. So I hold down on the top with some force while it is grinding. Other than those two quibbles...it works fine....BUT they need to address those 2 things then I could give it a 5 STAR rating."
1,"Beware, this grinder will not last long","I purchased this unit 6 weeks ago. It lasted for 5 grinding sessions before it broke.Customer support at Hamilton offered me to ""cut of the cord"" and mail it in, with a money order for $7.95 to ship it back.I have to run to get that money order and the spend around $10 total shipping a device that cost $24 new back and forth.So much for customer service.I'll get the new unit and see how long that lasts, next time I will spent a little more money on a quality product. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,"Not what I expected, but it's still nice","For some odd reason, I thought I was getting a proper burr-grinder for coffee. Instead, it's a blade grinder. Coffee connoisseurs will tell you you don't want a blade grinder. However, to my delight it's a lot better than my existing spice grinder, so now that's its purpose in life. The removable grinding chamber is probably the best feature so I'm not having to upend and entire grinder to get my spices out for my cooking."
1,"Five months after Purchase, This Product is in the Trash","This Hamilton Beach coffee grinder was shipped on July 10, 2011, and as of December 19, 2011, it is in the trash. If I had looked closer at the reviews I would have known of the switch problems that make this product worthless. I came on line here to see if it could be returned and learned that it has a 30 day return period! What a black eye for Amazon to be associated with junk like this.Hamilton Beach 80374 Custom Grind Hands-Free Coffee Grinder, Black"
1,Broke after 4 uses,"After 4 uses of the grinder, it broke. Take a look at the reviews and you'll see others have had the same issue. Stay away and look for a different grinder."
2,Worked pretty well for about ten weeks,"It does what they say: grinds coffee hands-free. The finest grind really isn't fine enough for me, but I can just push the button again for regrinding. It's a bit messy to get the ground coffee out, as there isn't a neat dainty spout, but it works and I got excellent coffee from it. Until today, when it stopped working and just buzzed. Looked up the warranty, which says ""There is no warranty with respect to the following, which may be supplied with this product, including without limitation: glass parts, glass containers, cutter/strainers, blades, seals, gaskets, clutches, motor brushes, and/or agitators, etc."" The part that broke connects the motor to the grinding unit, it must be a clutch or maybe an ""etc."" So I shall have to get another grinder, hopefully a more durable one."
1,Attractive but hopeless,This is the second HB 80374 grinder in the past year and both died within four months. The different grinder gauges are a real draw but there is something seriously defective with the actual machinery.
4,review,"Works good: Grind is pretty consistent, although I have found some whole grains. It is pretty small and easy to clean, which I really like."
4,Good Deal!,"We are both very happy with this purchase. I had an old Mr. Coffe one setting grinder we have used for over 15 years. My hubby wanted an auto-grinder w/preset functions (such as drip, French press, and espresso). It does a perfect job grinding the beans to the correct consitancy, except for drip. My husband likes a corse grind, so we set it for four cups even though we have enough beans in the machine for 8. A little tip for perfecting personal preference."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"We bought this to replace a cuisinart that simply for some reason quit working and being hooked on freshly ground coffee, well what are you going to do? So it looks good seems good, but it is different in that you turn it upside down to get the coffee out and into the plastic cup, that's ok, I can live with it. But what is annoying to me is that it isn't big enough for our 14 cup maker. It says it grinds 15 cups worth but that is not true unless you like really weak coffee. So we end up doing it twice to get our 14 cupper's filter topped off. I wouldn't buy another one, but neither would I get another cuisinart, so we'll wait for this one to die and try something else."
4,Good Grinder,"I bought this over a year ago. It has worked well. Sometimes you have to hold the top tightly closed to keep the grinder from shutting off as others have said, mostly you do not. These type of grinders are made to grind the beans for only about 2 pots of coffee at a time. If you try to grind more the motor overheats and the grinder fails. I have purchased 2 others that failed. A key to long life of these grinders is to give them a rest for 3-4 hours after you grind before grinding again. I would buy this model again."
4,Great Grinder For French Press Coffee,"I bought this little grinder because I didnt want to spend a ton of money on a burr grinder for my French Press coffee. I read other reviews and most seemed pleased with it. I would agree. It grinds fresh beans course like a burr grinder, and does it quickly. Lots of power for such a small grinder. Haven't used the other settings since I don't brew coffee. I read some bad comments about the cord being too short, and I'm wondering why you would need a cord any longer than the one provided. It's just fine. Frustration Saver Alert: This grinder will not turn on unless the clear plastic cover is fully set and locked (twisted) in place. The directions don't really tell you that. Enjoy your new grinder!"
4,Best Grinder for Espresso,If you don't clean this grinder regularly where the plastic top fits...the on button will appear not to work because you need a tight fit. Thats why they provide a cleaning brush. I've had my grinder for 1.5 years now and its only now that its not working because the plastic top has cracked from me dropping it. This grinder makes the finest grind for espresso that I know...that's in comparison to the other 4 grinders I have in my cupboard that I've retired due to a poor grind and difficulty cleaning.
2,Not worth the money,"This grinder is neatly small and has a nice cable storage, but that's about the positives. It grinds coffee, is very loud and has a very flimsy power switch. After 1 week I can only get it to work after taking very special care of how to press the on-button, otherwise it does not work at all. Also, I need to hold the unit without taking my hands away because it will otherwise stop and will not get started again.Disappointed. Do not waste your money on this one."
2,Good Performance but Motor Broke After One Year,"I purchased this grinder and have been pleased with its performance grinding coffee beans each morning (especially the hands-free feature) until last week when the motor gave out *exactly 1 year from purchase date*. Hamilton Beach customer service offered to send a replacement for fourteen dollars because it was still under warranty. I thought this was a solid purchase, but ultimately I am disappointed with the quality of the product and of the manufacturer's customer service policies. Would look elsewhere next time."
3,short cord!,"works good, cap must be on tight and aligned, but the cord is 6 inchs long so you need an extension cord to run it on your counter."
1,Constant smell of electrical fire,"We got this product a month and a half ago from Amazon, and my girlfriend immediately noticed a burning, electrical smell whenever it was in use. We exchanged it (thanks Amazon!) and hoped that the previous one had just been a fluke..... looks like there's no such luck. The new one is even worse: the lid is cracked, the cord is kinked so that it doesn't extend or retract properly, and it STILL smell of electrical fire whenever it's grinding coffee.Oh, and did I mention, unless you shake it while it's grinding, it leaves whole beans? And the line that indicates ""15 cups"" is hardly even enough for 9.I'm really not picky about coffee grinders. I would have opted for one of those old-style ones with non-separable grinding bowls, but this one seemed too good to be true - removable bowl, hands-free, retractable cord.Should have known."
3,Hands Free only WHEN NEW,"We've owned and abused our H/B 80374 for 3 years now and are extremely happy with it. When it's not grinding coffee, it's used to grind and powder dried herbs, roots and barks. The dishwasher safe, removable grinding basket w/blades truly insures easy and total cleanup. My only complaint is the clear plastic lid which acts as both a product cup and a ""run safety"" actuator. We've replaced ours six times @ $8.99 + t/s/h (or $20.00 each) from the only known supplier, Hamilton Beach, direct. As soon as the locks, incorporated at the base of the lid, begin to show ware or tiny cracks, get your replacement ordered."
5,Great Deluxe Grinder,"I love this! Having the different settings takes the guess work out of the different grinds, which is great because I have a drip machine, a French press, and a stove top moka pot, which all need different grinds.The second best thing is that the grinder part is removable. This makes it easier to pour the grinds out, and easier to clean.I also like that the cord is retractable. This lives on my counter next to my coffee machine and it's nice to have the cord all neatly inside the unit.I highly recommend this. It's well made, great features, and I'm happy with the way it grinds my coffee."
1,Shorted out after 1 month,"I am very disappointed that this grinder died on me only after 1 month of use. I was grining about 1/2 a pound of coffee beans to take to work. I filled the grinding cup to the max, which is about 16 teaspoons. After 3 rounds of doing this, I noticed that the grinder was smoking. Then the grinder stopped. I unplugged the machine and tried to use it this morning, to no success."
2,Broke within 2 months,"I read many reviews before buying it as a present for my wife. I ran into similar problems. The cover eventually does not engage the safety mechanism, so it doesn't grind unless it is held manually. This wasn't a big deal to us. However, it eventually quit working all together in 2 months. The machine isn't broken but the plastic tab on the cover was worn and was no longer in contact of the safety mechanism. I would not recommend this project."
2,"So far, lid comes loose and grinding not good","Well, I've read on here the newer models are better at the lid not coming loose when grinding. Not for me! It might stay on for 15 seconds before the grinding knocks it loose. I have to hold it in place.The timer is...well questionable. I set it to 15 cups on espresso for maybe a half of the steel cup. Holding it in place, it ground for 50 seconds or so (I counted 53). You figure the coffee would be almost powder, right? Nope. I'd say it was half way between drip and espresso. Some of the coffee on the very bottom was finer. So, I'd say don't trust the timer.It does work, but I question the design in two ways. Obviously you have to question the lid, but I think the steel cup's depth in relation to its geometry might make it difficult for the grinder to grind evenly or very fast. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.I'm thinking of returning it."
1,Not the grinder you're looking for,I ordered two of these on Amazon and one through WalMart. None of them worked. I would avoid this product. GE makes a quality coffee/spice grinder.
1,Piece of junk,"We've had this a month and have used it 1-2 times a week, and the motor has already burned out. Before the motor went, we found that it did not grind a fine as it should have, nor did it grind consistently.We do not suggest your purchase this item."
2,good grinder marred by a flimsy top cover,"Works great but ... the plastic top cover that also acts as a switch is fragile and broke within a week.The replacement part is under warranty, but ... I had to shell an extra 8$ for S&H.;Call me cheap but it does not seem normal to me. Buyer beware."
4,Excellent Value for the money,"This is an excellent value for the money and I love the hand's free functionality. Please note, you will have the ""shake it"" mid cycle otherwise all the beans will not grind. A minor concern.The corn retracts into the base, which I did not know but love. Cord for some people may be short, but how much length do you need?"
1,"Junk. had two, both tore up the first day I used them","I would stop selling this product, if it was me. The blade won't stay on, I used the first one 30 minutes and the second one 5 minutes. Both of them the blades came off, they are junk, and told people they were, not to buy them. I called the maker, they said they would would send me a replayment part, they sent me the wrong part. I gave up and lost forty some dollars, Yes, I hate it!!!"
2,$25 to grind a 1/4 of coffee...once.,"I liked the design and and the idea of an auto grind switch, but after one use it quit working. Now it's a fight to get the thing to grind at all. On top of that it's 40 days since I bought it and Amazon won't give a full refund after 30 days. The cost is too low to bother returning the junk to the manufacturer. So my only option is to not buy Hamilton Beach products in the future. It may only have been $25, but that is A LOT of money to grind a 1/4 pound of coffee."
5,Great little machine!,Love being able to program a pot to brew in the morning for work and still make a good cup of tea or coffee on the single side in the evening. I also like the fact that I don't have to invest in those expensive little single cups. I can use my own blend on either side and to my liking. Would recommend this to those looking for the dual capability in their coffee makers.
1,Complete piece of junk,"Received this grinder and got it all set up, plugged it in and it didn't work. It has several pieces to it so I made sure everything was put together properly and still no go. Unfortunately, we had already recycled the box it came in and Hamilton Beach will send you a replacement if you pay for the shipping (they charge you half the cost of the grinder to ship it). No thanks. You want me to spend MORE money on something that doesn't work? Why would I take that risk? Do yourself a favor and do not buy this piece of trash."
1,"Item was Broken when Received, then Motor Burned Out.","The packaging was fine but the lid was cracked. Rather than bother returning it, I worked around the issue with some epoxy.A few weeks later, the motor must have burned out. I could smell an electrical burn smell and it has ceased to work and on the way to the dump.For true espresso, I suppose this cheap grinder is not ideal. Surprising from Hamilton Beach, I buy almost everything from them because all my other kitchen items have lasted years and keep going.For $20, it was not worth bothering to get a replacement unit, I will just buy something a bit less disposable."
4,TOO BIG,A BIT TOO LARGE FOR MY SPACE. I HAVE A SMALL KITCHEN AND THIS GRINDER TAKES UP TOO MUCH ROOM. IT IS A BEAUTY EVEN THOUGH I MAY HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY.
1,Not Made to Last,Very disappointed in this product. After less than year of daily use the cheap plastic housing that passes for an on/off button stopped working and the internal contact points broke off. So now I can't turn the thing on.
3,"Good grinder, but smells","Had this grinder for over a year now. Noticed when I first got it that there was a slight electrical smell that came from it after grinding. I thought the smell would stop after awhile, a year later it's still happening and I am looking to replace it"
2,Not a keeper,"Pro: Really liked the removable cup.Minor Con: Didn't like how short the cord was, though not a deal-breaker (was aware the cord was short, but decided to try this model).Deal-breaker: Appliance emitted a distinct overheating smell after each use. Grinder was used 1-2 times daily approximately 30 seconds each time, for 2-3 cups of coffee total.Already returned (and received a very prompt refund from Amazon)."
1,"Good design, poor execution","It is simply amazing how a company can take a truly good design and ruin it to increase their bottom line. I hadn't used this for more than a few times when it stopped working. I inspected the remarkably cheaply made plastic cover, and noticed it was cracked. In order for this grinder to properly function, you must twist this cover until it locks - I must at some point have twisted a bit too hard. Anyway, I managed to get it working by putting a rubber band around it, holding the crack closed while I carefully twisted it into place. However, after using it maybe 20 times this way, the thing totally died. Not a peep out of it. It's actually just a piece of junk - if you must have a cheap grinder, stay with a simple design - less to go wrong. Customer service was useless since I could not find my receipt. Based on the agent's tone of voice, they know this is a piece of junk. I've just ordered the Mr. Coffee burr grinder - we'll see..."
1,very poor,"After about 1 week of use the plastic cover would no longer latch. It doesn't appear that anything broke, but it must have worn slightly. I now have to continually apply a twisting pressure while grinding or else the grinder will stop.Also, you cannot use it repeatedly, so if you like to grind enough coffee for a few days at once, this is not the machine for you. Just doing two fine grinds in a row causes it to smoke quite a *lot* and emit a nasty odor. I am not sure how this has gotten such good reviews. It is inferior to all the basic, $10-15 models I've tried."
4,Outstanding Performance But Not Durable,"We bought our first Hamilton Beach grinder about 10 months ago and we loved the consistency of the coffee taste, the fact that it rarely needs to be cleaned and the convenience of running hands-free. However it recently died -- we depressed the start button, nothing happened. Re-engaged the grinder bowl and the lid to be sure the interlocks are engaged, depressed the start button, and nothing happened. DOA. We misplaced the receipt so we could not use the warranty -- bad move. We ordered a new unit and it failed in the same way on first use. Called Hamilton Beach and eventually we received a replacement but this time we are keeping the receipt (proof of purchase date) handy. We like this grinder so much we are willing to keep replacing it."
